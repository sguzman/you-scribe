1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:24,000
My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything you hate.

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Foreign invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands by a cabal of globalist elites.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization as we know it.

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Now, watch as those same wives are violated,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
those same children violated,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
and dashed to pieces under the black boots of the Third World Horde.

11
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Does that thought fill you with rage?

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Good.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
We must be prepared to fight.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
To fight for our children,

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and for our nation,

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and for our history,

17
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and for our culture.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
To fight for the homeland we've always known,

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and the people we've always loved.

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Make America great again.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hail Victory!

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,000
So, actually, according to Hegel,

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
the for itself can only be actualized through the in itself,

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the transcendence of the dialectical object

27
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
through the sublimation of negative materiality.

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists!

29
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Death to capitalism!

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hail Satan!

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Well, what do you expect?

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
We have the politicians against us,

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
a media run by giant corporations,

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
and a complacent white middle class

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that prefers order to justice.

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So, let's accept that all that's true.

39
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The game is rigged. Fine.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Now, how do you respond to that situation?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Do you change nothing about your strategy at all

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
and then blame the system when the predictable happens?

43
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Look, I don't really need optics advice

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
from a bougie queer esthete

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
who puts style over substance

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
and thinks that shining a pink light on everything

48
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
can cover up her counter-revolutionary

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Trotskyite tendencies.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I mean, are you even a communist?

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No! I'm not a communist.

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Well, why not?

53
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Mmm! I like stuff.

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I like this, and I like this, and I like this.

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
And that's why I can't be a communist.

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
between private property and personal property, right?

58
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You're allowed to own possessions,

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
you just can't exploit people by owning the means of production.

60
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.

61
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Well, you should feel bad about that.

62
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.

63
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Right.

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?

67
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
That's what I thought.

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And they're afraid of you.

70
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Well, fascists are afraid of me.

71
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Really?

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Let's see.

74
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
We've got guillotines, Soviet memes,

75
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
liberals get the bullet too.

76
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
you're some kind of scary terrorist.

78
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Okay, Jesus.

79
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Let's hear your mind-blowing revelations

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
about respectability policy.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Great.

82
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Positives first.

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The rose is great.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Love the rose.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Fantastic.

87
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Now, the hammer and sickle.

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
We're gonna need to get rid of that.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm just wearing it ironically.

90
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Now, don't you start with that.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It makes me think of red lines and gulags,

92
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
and it needs to go.

93
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Well, maybe you're right.

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Fine, I'll get rid of it.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
See, I can think about optics.

96
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What's that in your bag?

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Oh, this?

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

99
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
We're gonna need to do something about that too.

100
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Now, hold on.

101
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing,

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
but Marx is a foundational thinker

103
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
in the history of progressive political...

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx.

105
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I'm talking about giving him a makeover.

106
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.

107
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It's making me depressed just looking at it.

108
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Red and gold?

109
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What is this foreign shit?

110
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?

111
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
It's un-American.

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I don't trust it.

113
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I don't like the cut of its jib.

114
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So you want a Marx Angles reader

115
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
wrapped in an American flag.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Oh, I can do you better than that.

117
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let's start with a gradient.

118
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Add a grid.

119
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Maybe a wave grid.

120
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's get some shiny fonts.

121
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Maybe a bust.

122
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
A pink bust with 3D glasses.

123
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Pink glasses.

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Maybe some palm trees.

125
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Oh, yeah.

126
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Or how about this?

127
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Lots of brands.

128
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
More, more, more.

129
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh, my God.

130
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's beautiful.

131
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Okay, one more, one more.

132
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
A pink field.

133
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Chiclet.

134
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Yeah.

135
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Yes, girl.

136
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Yes.

137
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I just realized that I actually hate you.

138
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Hello, fellow whites.

139
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and a

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
future for white children?

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Get the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.

142
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Effective, isn't it?

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Well, I see your point.

144
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,

145
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
if there's some way you can not do that.

146
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?

147
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.

148
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
But that means getting 30,000 people on your side, which you're not gonna do by tweeting

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
death threats and communist propaganda and using words like dialectic and telling everyone

150
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas

151
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with and expecting

152
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
that people are gonna wanna leave their jobs and comfortable lives to join a violent revolution

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.

154
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Well, that's an unfair association.

155
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.

156
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Has there ever been real communism?

157
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Well, yes.

158
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary eastern Cameroon, a thriving, though short-lived,

159
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
communist utopia did flourish.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Until it was smashed by Western imperialism.

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Right.

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?

163
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You seem to not even care about what's actually possible.

164
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
That's how deep you are in pure theory.

165
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.

167
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.

168
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs, you're never accountable for the

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
way things are going.

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm not saying theory is everything.

171
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Only that there's no praxis.

172
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.

173
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
For all I know, you could be correct.

174
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm just saying it's a tough sell, and you are not selling it.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal intellectual

176
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
void where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing have shifted the Overton

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,000
window one inch left of fascism under the heading of free speech and classical liberalism.

178
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?

179
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hey, hey, hey.

180
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You leave centrists alone.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Thanks, Justine.

182
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Jackie, get out of here.

183
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.

184
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll see you at brunch.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Mimosas.

186
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
What the hell was that?

187
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Brunch?

188
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're gonna brunch with these people?

189
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.

190
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Afternoon tea?

191
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Does Jeeves bring around madeleine cookies and fresh-sliced lemon wedges?

192
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No, but I do have a very nice Windsor China tea set.

193
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Unbelievable.

194
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You get the bullet, too.

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You get the goddamn bullet, too.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Oh, come on.

197
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Me?

198
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What do you want me to do?

199
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Drink victory gin out of a rusty herring tin like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries

200
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
in eastern Cameroon?

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.

202
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle shooting at capitalists with

203
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
a black beret and an eye patch, and I still wouldn't be left-wing enough for you.

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists

205
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
and not complaining about the optics?

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep

207
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
you safe.

208
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
How is Antifa keeping me safe?

209
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.

210
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Most of what we do is behind-the-scenes organizing, infiltrating fascist groups, doxing them, disrupting

211
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
their recruitment, and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist rallies.

212
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long

213
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
enough, you're going to be at a counter-protest and the Black Bloc is going to save your life,

214
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
because you don't look like you can fight, and the police certainly aren't going to save

215
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
you.

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, maybe so.

217
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I mean, I'm the first to admit, these are not Nazi-punching hands, so I'm not going

218
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
to get in your way, but in the free marketplace of ideas, and like it or not, that's what

219
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,000
we're in, I can't help but think that what you are matters less than what you seem to

220
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,000
be, and black-clad thugs and masks smashing things in the street seems pretty scary.

221
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Oh come on, you have to admit, there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.

222
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What about a girl in a mask?

223
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.

224
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Well, it was worth a shot.

225
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Look, my point is, you can't just win the war in the street.

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You mean the propaganda war.

228
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Shhh.

229
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Don't call it propaganda.

230
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
There could be liberals listening.

231
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Look, what the left needs to get, and what the centrists need to get, and what only I

232
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and fascists seem to understand, is that reason doesn't matter very much.

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Oh boy.

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Here we go.

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What is it the centrists hate about social justice warriors?

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's not that they don't have good reasons in support of their arguments, it's that they're

237
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
not cool, right?

238
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Social justice warriors are not cool.

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
What do you mean?

240
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They're not popular?

241
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
No, no, no, I mean they're not cool.

242
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can be unpopular and still cool.

243
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
In fact, it can be cool to be unpopular.

244
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
So what does it mean to be cool?

245
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself, and the leading complaint about

246
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
social justice warriors is that they're not cool.

247
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,000
The social justice warriors who everyone cringes at online are people who I'm sure are nice

248
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
people, but who are having a bad moment, and they're caught on camera in the middle of

249
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
an outburst.

250
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
They're out of control.

251
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
And that's the problem.

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's not cool.

253
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Luck.

254
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
This detached, ironic, pretend-not-to-give-a-shit posturing that white men mistake for rationality

255
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,000
is really just the self-celebration of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.

256
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
People on the left are never going to be cool because anger and emotion are rational responses

257
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
to injustice.

258
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I thought you'd say that.

259
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,000
But what you're failing to consider is that it's possible to be both angry and cool.

260
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger into a glass of cool?

261
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What?

262
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You get ice cold.

263
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry, what?

264
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And that's what we on the left need to become.

265
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Ice cold motherfuckers.

266
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
What the hell are you talking about?

267
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Miles Davis.

268
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Incredibly cool.

269
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
But pretty angry.

270
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Did not take shit from white people.

271
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But also, ice cold motherfucker.

272
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
So your plan is to win over centrists by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.

273
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Precisely.

274
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.

275
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
This is ridiculous.

276
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
And I suppose you think this is ridiculous.

277
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I think it's stalemate.

278
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No it's not.

279
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
My queen is wide open.

280
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
No it isn't.

281
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Take me.

282
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm gonna get going now.

283
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Wait, where are you going?

284
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm gonna go bash the fash.

285
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Well, be careful.

286
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Sure.

287
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Enjoy your tea tomorrow.

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What a goddamn lunatic.

289
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I'm gonna miss her.

290
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You gotta move him off the ice.

291
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm going.

292
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Good luck.

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
See ya.

294
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Go.

295
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Yeah.

296
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
See ya.

297
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
See ya.

298
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You.

299
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yeah.

300
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:50,420
Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?

301
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,300
They got into a fight on Skype, remember?

302
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,940
Anyway, they killed each other.

303
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:54,760
They're both dead.

304
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,420
They kind of fired guns off in random directions.

305
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,900
It's best not to think about it too much.
