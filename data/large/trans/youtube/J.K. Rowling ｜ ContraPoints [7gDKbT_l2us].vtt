WEBVTT

00:00.400 --> 00:02.800
Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.280
Fireborn and cauldron bubble.

00:10.880 --> 00:16.800
Something wicked this way comes. Magical deeds are afoot, dear readers. Magical darkness.

00:20.080 --> 00:20.800
A must.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.680
Joanne, I want to talk to you, Joanne.

00:25.680 --> 00:31.440
What is it about Joannes? I can't catch a break from these people.

00:31.440 --> 00:37.280
So now that 2020 is finally over, I think we can let the record conclusively show

00:37.840 --> 00:42.400
that it was a year homest is bad. And on top of everything else that was going on,

00:42.400 --> 00:46.880
truly the last thing we needed was the author of Harry Potter coming forward to announce

00:46.880 --> 00:52.800
there's two things she can't stand. Bigotry and the transgenders. Ow.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.640
Elderberry wand.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.920
Turgid. With a core of…

00:59.760 --> 01:01.680
Ice dragon. Lumos.

01:01.680 --> 01:03.920
Can we afford spells? Is that in the budget?

01:03.920 --> 01:05.200
Expecto Patreon.

01:05.920 --> 01:09.920
So you've probably heard by now about Joanne Rowling's transphobic tweets.

01:09.920 --> 01:14.160
Unless you've been living under a rock, in which case, get back under that rock,

01:14.160 --> 01:18.560
sweetie, there is nothing good going on up here, it's not worth it. Or maybe you heard that all

01:18.560 --> 01:25.440
Joanne did was say biological sex is real, and now crazy gender ideologues and trans activists are

01:25.440 --> 01:31.680
trying to silence her. This is cancel culture gone too far. This is a witch hunt. Celebrities are

01:31.680 --> 01:37.200
under attack. This is the new Salem. This is Orwell's nightmare. This is a painful topic for

01:37.200 --> 01:44.080
me all around, because as a transgender woman, I am honestly hurt by a lot of the things Joanne

01:44.080 --> 01:49.200
has said in the last year. But I also know what it's like to be the target of a Twitter mob.

01:49.200 --> 01:53.600
And I realize that to most people, complaining about being cancelled, it sounds incredible, but

01:54.560 --> 01:59.360
it sounds incredibly whiny and self-absorbed. Like, you'd especially think that rich and

01:59.360 --> 02:05.440
famous people like JK Rowling would be above staying up alone at night reading mean things

02:05.440 --> 02:11.520
people say online. But you'd think wrong. See, you underestimate the fundamental sadness of the

02:11.520 --> 02:17.360
human condition. And no amount of fame and money is gonna fix that. You know, fame alienates you

02:17.360 --> 02:23.360
from other people. It dehumanizes you in the eyes of the masses. Which can actually make you feel

02:23.360 --> 02:28.800
more alone, even when people are worshipping you as a goddess. Never mind how it feels when they're

02:28.800 --> 02:35.520
hunting you as a witch. The truth is that unless you've personally experienced infamy, being shamed

02:35.520 --> 02:40.160
and shunned on a scale the human brain can't really even understand, then you just don't know

02:40.160 --> 02:45.840
what it's like. And you don't know how you'd react in that situation. But Joanne knows, and when I

02:45.840 --> 02:51.120
see her getting trashed on the TL, there's a traumatized part of me that's unironically

02:51.120 --> 02:57.120
triggered by watching people cancel her. And I want to protect. My nurturing and compassionate

02:57.120 --> 03:02.400
nature sometimes gets the best of me. But there's also a part of me that wants to join the trashing.

03:02.400 --> 03:07.360
How could you do this to me, Joanne? I did not come out of the cupboard under the stairs for this.

03:07.360 --> 03:12.800
So what I want to do in this video is take Joanne's pain seriously and treat her like a complex human

03:12.800 --> 03:19.840
being, while also being critical of the things she said about the transgender question. And I also

03:21.120 --> 03:27.520
want to know where the Twitter mob is coming from. Because they're in pain too, and don't they also

03:27.520 --> 03:34.960
deserve our understanding? So without further ado, let's go in with a Mac 224 tapered blending brush

03:34.960 --> 03:39.840
and see if we can find the truth. Swish and flick.

03:51.120 --> 03:56.400
So is the author of Harry Potter a bigot? Well, she certainly seems invested in the belief that

03:56.400 --> 04:03.040
she's not a bigot. What vice do you most despise? Bigotry. In looking over Joanne's tweets,

04:03.040 --> 04:07.680
I don't think the average person would see any problem with what she said. However,

04:08.400 --> 04:13.360
I mean, not to be condescending, but I feel like the average person's understanding of

04:13.360 --> 04:19.760
transgender is still a little bit... I don't really get the whole trans thing. Like,

04:21.120 --> 04:28.080
why don't you just be a feminine man? I don't know, Amber. Why don't you be a feminine man?

04:28.080 --> 04:32.000
Who knows, you could be missing out. So we're going to go through the things that Joanne has

04:32.000 --> 04:37.600
said about trans people, but I don't want this to be just a drama video or a video saying,

04:37.600 --> 04:43.120
cancel Harry Potter, drag her. Like, I want to try to do something a little bit more meaningful

04:43.120 --> 04:50.320
than that. So I'm going to use J.K. Rowe as a case study in bigotry and see if we can maybe learn

04:50.320 --> 04:51.120
something about

04:51.120 --> 04:56.880
what bigotry is, how does it work, and how do otherwise good people get drawn into it.

04:56.880 --> 05:01.280
And if we can make any progress on any of those questions, well, for once I think I'll actually

05:01.280 --> 05:06.480
have earned my Patreon budget. So keeping in mind our very serious and educational purpose,

05:07.360 --> 05:09.840
let's spill some shade, throw some tea.

05:10.960 --> 05:16.480
So this all started in 2018 when Joanne liked a transphobic tweet and followed an

05:16.480 --> 05:21.040
anti-trans account. Now in the interest of giving Joanne as much benefit of the doubt as I can,

05:21.120 --> 05:25.680
I'm not going to admit this as evidence because I don't want to do guilt by association.

05:25.680 --> 05:26.800
Strike it from the record.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.360
That was fun. I like hammering things.

05:31.120 --> 05:35.840
The real story begins in December 2019 when Joanne tweeted the hashtag

05:35.840 --> 05:38.880
I stand with Maya, referencing Maya Forstater.

05:38.880 --> 05:43.920
Maya Forstater is an English consultant who lost her contract with the non-profit she worked for

05:43.920 --> 05:49.600
after she did transphobic tweets. And Maya has been kind enough to compile them all for us in her

05:49.600 --> 05:50.320
thread titled,

05:50.320 --> 05:53.120
Allegedly Transphobic Tweets.

05:53.120 --> 05:57.040
Well, let's take a look and see how alleged they are.

05:57.040 --> 06:01.360
Yes, I think that male people are not women. I don't think that being a woman or female

06:01.360 --> 06:05.120
is a matter of identity or womanly feelings. It is biology.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.240
Another says,

06:06.240 --> 06:11.680
Some people believe that a person with a penis can be a woman. Some, a majority, don't.

06:11.680 --> 06:16.080
Neither group should be discriminated against in everyday life, but in situations involving

06:16.080 --> 06:20.320
taking your clothes off with strangers, integration of the two groups is not possible.

06:20.320 --> 06:24.960
And there's a cartoon of a hairy-armed, hairy-legged, burgeoning trans woman

06:24.960 --> 06:27.600
flashing her penis at cis women and saying,

06:27.600 --> 06:30.000
It's alright, it's a woman's penis.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.680
So we're looking at a standard transphobia starter pack.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.360
Everyone born female is a woman, everyone born male is a man,

06:37.360 --> 06:42.720
trans women are predators who prey on women, and I'm being oppressed for speaking the truth.

06:42.720 --> 06:46.960
Is this what you want, Joanne? You want to put the sorting hat on humanity and divide us up into

06:46.960 --> 06:50.160
little houses? Well, what if I'm a Gryffindor trapped in a Hufflepuff's box?

06:50.160 --> 06:53.280
What then, Joanne? What then?

06:53.280 --> 06:58.480
Okay, so why does Joanne stand with Maya? Well, if the tweet simply said I stand with

06:58.480 --> 07:02.720
Maya without further explanation, you could give her the benefit of the doubt.

07:02.720 --> 07:06.880
Maybe she just doesn't think people should lose their job for having bigoted opinions,

07:06.880 --> 07:08.800
even if she disagrees with those opinions.

07:08.800 --> 07:13.200
But if that's all she was saying, I wouldn't be making this video, would I?

07:13.200 --> 07:14.640
The full tweet reads,

07:14.640 --> 07:20.080
Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult.

07:20.160 --> 07:24.160
Live your best life in peace and security.

07:24.160 --> 07:28.320
But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.440
Hashtag I stand with Maya. Hashtag this is not a drill.

07:31.440 --> 07:37.120
Now, I'm guessing that to most people, this tweet at first glance doesn't seem transphobic.

07:37.120 --> 07:41.920
It might even seem supportive of trans people since she said we're allowed to dress however

07:41.920 --> 07:47.360
we want and call ourselves whatever crazy thing. But there's a couple of things about this that

07:47.360 --> 07:49.840
don't sit right with me. First is the phrase,

07:50.160 --> 07:54.720
force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.

07:54.720 --> 08:01.520
Sex is real is a pretty dishonest summary of what Maya said in her discrimination complaint, namely,

08:01.520 --> 08:05.200
I believe that it is impossible to change your sex or to lose your sex.

08:05.200 --> 08:09.840
Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men. No change of clothes or hairstyle,

08:09.840 --> 08:14.800
no plastic surgery, no accident or illness, no course of hormones, no force of will or

08:14.800 --> 08:20.000
social conditioning, no declaration, can turn a female person into a male or a male person into

08:20.000 --> 08:25.440
a female. If Joanne had said Maya had been fired for claiming that a person born male could never

08:25.440 --> 08:31.040
be a woman and a person born female could never be a man, that would have been more accurate.

08:31.040 --> 08:35.200
But it would also sound contentious and obviously anti-trans.

08:35.200 --> 08:40.800
Sex is real is a euphemism designed to present Maya Forstater's transphobia as a simple

08:40.800 --> 08:47.280
statement of fact, basic common sense, which only crazy activists and ideologues would oppose.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.520
Transphobes love to play this game where they

08:49.520 --> 08:54.320
pretend that trans people just don't understand basic biology. That's our problem.

08:54.320 --> 08:58.160
As if I didn't start taking female hormones because I'm acutely aware

08:58.160 --> 09:02.560
that my body is not the same as a cis woman's body. That sex is real.

09:02.560 --> 09:08.320
You will never be a woman, Nathan. Every cell in your body is male and has a Y chromosome.

09:09.200 --> 09:12.960
Really? That's crazy. How'd you learn so much about science?

09:12.960 --> 09:17.040
You know, I don't really feel the need to have a second X chromosome. I get by with one.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.160
I make it work.

09:18.160 --> 09:19.440
I actually like the Y chromosome.

09:19.520 --> 09:24.880
I think it's a little more dainty, you know? It's a little softer, a little more petite.

09:24.880 --> 09:28.640
The X chromosome has a lot of extra appendages, don't you think?

09:28.640 --> 09:30.960
And I don't need any more of those, thanks.

09:30.960 --> 09:34.480
No trans person thinks it's possible to change chromosomal sex,

09:34.480 --> 09:37.360
and to pretend otherwise is to argue in bad faith.

09:37.360 --> 09:40.400
When we say that someone is a trans man or a trans woman,

09:40.400 --> 09:43.120
we're talking about psychological and social identity.

09:43.120 --> 09:48.720
So when transphobes say sex is real, they're not actually contradicting anything most trans people

09:48.720 --> 09:49.360
believe.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.360
Except by implication.

09:51.360 --> 09:57.040
When transphobes say sex is real, what they mean is only chromosomal sex matters.

09:57.040 --> 10:00.160
They mean they don't believe in transgender identity,

10:00.160 --> 10:03.360
which they trivialize, calling it dressing up.

10:03.360 --> 10:04.640
Fashion choices.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.800
Whatever you wanna call yourself.

10:06.800 --> 10:12.400
When Joanne says, dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like,

10:12.400 --> 10:17.760
she's belittling what it actually means to be trans, reducing it to a change of name and costume.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.200
It's similar to the language of cashmere.

10:19.200 --> 10:24.400
For example, the homophobic equivalent of Joanne's tweet might read,

10:24.400 --> 10:26.880
Choose whatever lifestyle you want.

10:26.880 --> 10:32.480
Indulge your sexual preferences with any consenting adult in the privacy of your own bedroom.

10:32.480 --> 10:38.000
But force Christians out of their jobs for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.640
Hashtag I stand with Kim Davis.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.320
A penis and a sausage cannot make a baby.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.080
Checkmate, the gays.

10:46.080 --> 10:47.840
It's just science.

10:47.840 --> 10:48.680
Homophobes trivially say that sex is real.

10:48.680 --> 10:50.600
Trivialize what it is to be gay.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.400
They refer to it as sexual preferences.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.080
Or a lifestyle.

10:55.080 --> 10:57.480
Or what you do in the bedroom.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.200
We don't tell straight people to keep their lifestyle in the bedroom.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.120
But we should.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.600
Clearly, the straights are not oppressed enough.

11:04.600 --> 11:08.120
Being gay is more than what you do in the bedroom.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.600
It's also who you love.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.120
It's part of who you are.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.320
Part of your humanity.

11:13.320 --> 11:16.760
And that's something that stays with you outside of the bedroom.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.360
So to dismiss it as sexual,

11:18.360 --> 11:20.280
or sexual preferences,

11:20.280 --> 11:21.560
is homophobic.

11:21.560 --> 11:26.040
Likewise, being trans is not a costume I take off at the end of the night.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.120
It's not a fashion choice.

11:28.120 --> 11:31.320
It's not a pet name some people call me.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.200
It's part of who I am as a person, you know?

11:34.200 --> 11:35.960
It's part of my humanity.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.040
And it's also the kind of body I have.

11:38.040 --> 11:39.720
A transsexual body.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.680
So telling trans people to dress however you want

11:42.680 --> 11:45.480
is not really a supportive statement.

11:45.480 --> 11:48.200
Unless you're supporting YouTubers wearing Louis Vuitton's...

11:48.360 --> 11:51.400
socks in their videos apologizing for being racist,

11:51.400 --> 11:53.080
which is not valid,

11:53.080 --> 11:54.440
and is in fact,

11:54.440 --> 11:55.720
a hate crime.

11:55.720 --> 11:58.440
YouTubers are constantly dragging each other because

11:58.440 --> 12:00.680
we see ourselves reflected in the other,

12:00.680 --> 12:02.600
and we can't stand the sight of it.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.440
So after the Maya Forrest daughter tweet,

12:04.440 --> 12:07.560
Joanne was silent about trans people for six months.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.280
But she took up the cause again in June 2019,

12:10.280 --> 12:12.200
first to complain about the use of the phrase

12:12.200 --> 12:14.680
people who menstruate in the title of an article

12:14.680 --> 12:17.480
trying to include trans men and non-binary people

12:17.480 --> 12:18.120
in a discussion of sex.

12:18.120 --> 12:23.080
That same night, presumably in response to her Twitter mentions

12:23.080 --> 12:25.240
being lit up by leftist teenagers who think

12:25.240 --> 12:28.200
Stalin did nothing wrong but Rachel Maddow is a war criminal,

12:28.200 --> 12:32.200
Joanne tweeted a thread again repeating the slogan that sex is real,

12:32.200 --> 12:32.760
adding,

12:32.760 --> 12:34.920
It isn't hate to speak the truth.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.360
And concluding with another backhanded statement of support.

12:38.360 --> 12:42.200
I respect every trans person's right to live any way

12:42.200 --> 12:44.840
that feels authentic and comfortable to them.

12:44.840 --> 12:47.480
I'd march with you if you were discriminated against

12:47.480 --> 12:48.040
on the basis,

12:48.040 --> 12:50.280
if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.

12:50.280 --> 12:54.360
If you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans?

12:55.160 --> 12:55.480
If?

12:56.040 --> 12:59.640
Widespread discrimination against trans people is well documented.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.120
In fact, the same week as Joanne's tweet,

13:02.120 --> 13:05.400
the Trump administration removed non-discrimination protections

13:05.400 --> 13:08.200
for trans people in health care and health insurance.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.840
So are you marching with us or not, Joanne?

13:10.840 --> 13:15.080
There's a lot of stuff in these tweets that might seem innocent enough to the average person,

13:15.080 --> 13:17.960
but which to someone who understands bigotry against trans people,

13:18.040 --> 13:20.200
raises a red flag.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.040
Bigotry always has a history.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.880
And in order to understand bigotry, you have to learn that history.

13:25.880 --> 13:31.240
Prejudices are made up of tropes, stereotypes, narratives, arguments,

13:31.240 --> 13:34.600
which we aren't born knowing, we have to learn them.

13:34.600 --> 13:38.120
No one is born thinking that the gays are destroying the family,

13:38.120 --> 13:40.360
or that women are naturally subservient,

13:40.360 --> 13:43.560
or that the Jews are trying to control the world economy.

13:43.560 --> 13:46.120
So if you aren't familiar with these prejudices,

13:46.120 --> 13:47.960
you might not notice anything wrong with them.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.960
He never said he hated the Jews.

13:49.960 --> 13:55.880
He is simply concerned about the over-representation of Jewish people in media and banking.

13:56.600 --> 13:59.560
But if you're aware, woke if you will,

13:59.560 --> 14:04.520
then it kind of rings alarm bells when you hear someone repeating bigoted talking points.

14:04.520 --> 14:08.360
When I see Joanne tweeting about how trans people think sex isn't real,

14:08.360 --> 14:12.440
and they're erasing same-sex attraction, and they're silencing women,

14:12.440 --> 14:17.480
alarm bells are ringing because I recognize these as familiar transphobic talking points.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.920
Specifically, TERF talking points.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.040
TERF means Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminism.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.640
God, are we still talking about this?

14:25.640 --> 14:27.720
I promise, this is the last time.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.960
So TERFism is a...

14:30.520 --> 14:35.560
It's a hate movement that disguises transphobia as feminism.

14:35.560 --> 14:37.240
Bigotry has a history.

14:37.240 --> 14:42.440
The foundational TERF text is feminist professor Janice Raymond's 1979 book

14:42.440 --> 14:46.280
The Transsexual Empire, The Making of the Sh**ty Male,

14:46.280 --> 14:47.960
in which Raymond argues that, quote,

14:48.360 --> 14:53.880
All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact,

14:53.880 --> 14:56.600
appropriating this body for themselves.

14:56.600 --> 15:00.200
She claims that trans women are agents of the patriarchy who, quote,

15:00.200 --> 15:03.640
merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women.

15:03.640 --> 15:07.000
This book set the general tone for feminist transphobia,

15:07.000 --> 15:12.760
and I bring this up because I want to give you a sense of how this kind of transphobe talks

15:12.760 --> 15:15.480
when they're not afraid of Twitter backlash.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.320
Typical male narcissist.

15:17.960 --> 15:25.320
Nathan manipulates his cultish audience into thinking he's the victim of the big ol' meanie TERFs.

15:25.320 --> 15:29.400
If you keep calling me Nathan, I'm gonna call you Nigel.

15:30.200 --> 15:31.880
Cheerio, old chap.

15:32.520 --> 15:34.040
Or whatever you people say.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.320
Here's the thing, Nigella.

15:35.320 --> 15:37.720
Bigotry can be mean, yes.

15:38.200 --> 15:42.120
And it usually is, when bigots think they can get away with it.

15:42.520 --> 15:47.160
But it's vital to recognize that being mean is not the essence of bigotry.

15:47.160 --> 15:47.720
Bigotry can be mean.

15:47.720 --> 15:54.480
Bigotry can be hateful, yes, but specifically, bigotry is hate that poses a political threat

15:54.480 --> 15:55.960
to the target group.

15:55.960 --> 16:01.020
The fundamental problem with TERFs is not that they're mean, it's that they're

16:01.020 --> 16:02.020
politically reactionary.

16:02.020 --> 16:04.900
They want to reverse the progress of trans liberation.

16:04.900 --> 16:10.680
In the final chapter of the Transsexual Empire, Raymond lays out her solution to the trans

16:10.680 --> 16:11.680
question, quote,

16:11.680 --> 16:18.000
The problem of transsexualism would be best served by morally mandating it out of existence.

16:18.000 --> 16:24.840
I believe that the elimination of transsexualism is not best achieved by legislation prohibiting

16:24.840 --> 16:29.940
transsexual treatment and surgery, but rather by legislation that limits it.

16:29.940 --> 16:35.880
I would favor restricting the number of hospitals and centers where transsexual surgery could

16:35.880 --> 16:37.100
be performed.

16:37.100 --> 16:41.660
The kind of counseling, to pass successfully as masculine or feminine,

16:41.660 --> 16:48.540
that now reigns in gender identity clinics only reinforces the problem of transsexualism.

16:48.540 --> 16:53.320
She goes on to argue for alternative, feminist, consciousness-raising therapies, admitting,

16:53.320 --> 16:59.040
I am not so naive as to think that they will make transsexualism disappear overnight, but

16:59.040 --> 17:04.940
they would at least pose the existence of a real alternative to be explored and tried.

17:04.940 --> 17:10.980
So like homophobes, TERFs have historically advocated a kind of conversion therapy aimed

17:10.980 --> 17:11.660
at eliminating transsexualism.

17:11.660 --> 17:14.040
transsexual identity and behavior.

17:14.040 --> 17:15.980
And like the anti-abortion movement,

17:15.980 --> 17:19.080
they recognize it's not yet politically practical

17:19.080 --> 17:21.720
to completely make illegal a medical procedure

17:21.720 --> 17:24.300
they don't like, so they settle for making it

17:24.300 --> 17:26.720
as difficult as possible to get one.

17:26.720 --> 17:29.480
In 1980, Janice Raymond authored a report

17:29.480 --> 17:31.480
to the Department of Health and Human Services

17:31.480 --> 17:33.980
repeating her arguments against transsexualism,

17:33.980 --> 17:36.320
which was cited in the 1981 decision

17:36.320 --> 17:39.660
that Medicare would not cover transition-related healthcare.

17:39.660 --> 17:41.460
That decision wasn't overturned

17:41.460 --> 17:44.980
until 2014, so there's real political consequences

17:44.980 --> 17:47.920
to bigotry, it's not just a matter of being mean.

17:47.920 --> 17:50.920
Polite bigotry can be just as dangerous.

17:50.920 --> 17:55.020
Unlike Janice Raymond, J.K. Rowling seems totally convinced,

17:55.020 --> 17:57.560
and very intent on convincing all of us,

17:57.560 --> 18:00.920
that she's a totally progressive LGBT ally

18:00.920 --> 18:03.380
who loves and supports trans people,

18:03.380 --> 18:07.240
while in the same breath, spewing transphobic arguments.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.200
She's constantly saying things like,

18:09.200 --> 18:11.200
"'I know and love trans people

18:11.200 --> 18:14.920
"'but I'd march with you if you were discriminated against

18:14.920 --> 18:18.400
"'on the basis of being trans at the same time.'"

18:18.400 --> 18:20.420
None of the gender-critical women I've talked to

18:20.420 --> 18:23.160
hates trans people, on the contrary.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.040
Many of them became interested in this issue

18:25.040 --> 18:28.340
in the first place out of concern for trans youth.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.240
A lot of people have a hard time noticing

18:30.240 --> 18:33.460
this kind of bigotry, and I think one reason for that

18:33.460 --> 18:36.880
is that our common understanding of bigotry is very narrow.

18:36.880 --> 18:39.980
People think of bigotry as like judging a group

18:39.980 --> 18:41.040
instead of an individual.

18:41.040 --> 18:41.180
People think of bigotry as like judging a group instead of an individual.

18:41.180 --> 18:41.560
people think of bigotry as like judging a group instead of an individual.

18:41.560 --> 18:44.380
Which is, of course, a horrible thing to do.

18:44.380 --> 18:46.080
I don't care for the English.

18:46.080 --> 18:48.420
They're sick, sick people.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.000
Or people think of bigotry as hate,

18:51.000 --> 18:53.140
something inhuman and monstrous.

18:53.140 --> 18:55.200
So when people hear the word bigot,

18:55.200 --> 18:58.720
they're expecting someone like Lord Voldemort,

18:58.720 --> 19:02.660
some uber-Nazi who despises love and friendship.

19:02.660 --> 19:04.800
But the problem with the Nazis was

19:04.800 --> 19:07.080
not that they hated love and friendship, right?

19:07.080 --> 19:10.760
They believed they were defending German blood and soil

19:10.760 --> 19:14.860
against Marxist-Bolshevism and Jewish contamination.

19:14.860 --> 19:16.720
And what were we supposed to do?

19:16.720 --> 19:20.560
Not defend the Reich against Polish atrocities?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.740
That's how a Nazi actually thinks, right?

19:22.740 --> 19:24.820
It's not that they hate friendship.

19:24.820 --> 19:26.940
No, they have their own internal logic

19:26.940 --> 19:29.460
of victimization and self-righteousness.

19:29.460 --> 19:33.400
So when you reduce bigotry to a caricature of pure hatred,

19:33.400 --> 19:37.320
you obscure that bigotry is a deeply human problem.

19:37.320 --> 19:39.040
You know, sometimes people criticize me

19:39.040 --> 19:40.600
for empathizing with bigots,

19:40.600 --> 19:44.340
but I believe that understanding bigots

19:44.340 --> 19:48.120
is the best defense against becoming one yourself.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.220
Because when you dehumanize the villains,

19:51.220 --> 19:55.280
you become unable to recognize the villain within.

19:55.280 --> 19:56.740
How is she, though?

19:56.740 --> 19:59.000
She needs a hot toddy is what she needs.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.220
Metal straw because I love the environment.

20:01.220 --> 20:03.580
I'm so good, I'm really fucking good.

20:03.580 --> 20:06.020
The idea that bigotry is simply hate,

20:06.020 --> 20:09.780
I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.

20:09.780 --> 20:13.020
It's the idea that bigots are people who outright say,

20:13.020 --> 20:15.580
we hate you, God hates you,

20:15.580 --> 20:17.420
and we're all marching around with signs

20:17.420 --> 20:18.920
about how much we hate you.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.600
Like the bad guys in that Taylor Swift video.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.900
Ugh, Taylor Swift.

20:22.900 --> 20:25.140
Everyone wants to be a gay icon now.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.360
Well, I don't.

20:26.360 --> 20:28.140
I don't want to be a gay icon.

20:28.140 --> 20:30.640
I'm just stuck with you people.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.480
Just kidding.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.800
Shade never made anybody less gay.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.980
Uh, this isn't Shade, Taylor.

20:35.980 --> 20:38.660
Shade is JK Rowling telling trans people,

20:38.660 --> 20:39.580
sleep with an eight.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.500
And scenting adult, who will have you.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.520
Bigotry is a lot more complicated than just hate.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.820
And the video for you need to calm down

20:47.820 --> 20:50.720
is just so emblematic of this misconception.

20:50.720 --> 20:53.340
Taylor takes this subject of homophobia

20:53.340 --> 20:56.720
and turns it into yet another song about haters.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.040
But in the real world,

20:58.040 --> 21:01.660
backwoods hillbillies stomping around with misspelled signs

21:01.660 --> 21:04.000
are not really the problem.

21:04.000 --> 21:07.140
The most dangerous bigots are highly sophisticated

21:07.140 --> 21:08.700
and powerful people.

21:08.700 --> 21:09.540
And yeah,

21:09.540 --> 21:11.340
there are still blatant homophobes who say,

21:11.340 --> 21:12.620
it's an abomination,

21:12.620 --> 21:14.280
these perverts are spreading AIDS,

21:14.280 --> 21:15.560
they're destroying the family,

21:15.560 --> 21:16.920
they're recruiting children.

21:16.920 --> 21:17.760
But these days,

21:17.760 --> 21:19.920
it's much more common to hear,

21:19.920 --> 21:22.300
of course I love gay people.

21:22.300 --> 21:25.660
Some of my best friends struggle with same-sex attraction.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.720
But it's not homophobic to not want LGBT ideology

21:29.720 --> 21:33.560
promoted in schools to children as young as three years old.

21:33.560 --> 21:37.220
Why, it's a full-on assault on religious liberty.

21:37.220 --> 21:39.300
And we get convincing homophobe, don't I?

21:39.540 --> 21:42.500
There's really two different styles of bigotry.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.360
They express the same prejudice,

21:44.360 --> 21:47.040
but they're very different in tone.

21:47.040 --> 21:50.980
I'll call the two styles direct bigotry and indirect bigotry.

21:50.980 --> 21:53.380
Direct bigotry is openly contemptuous.

21:53.380 --> 21:55.740
It's a bigotry manifested in slurs

21:55.740 --> 21:59.140
and outright discrimination and demonizing the target group

21:59.140 --> 22:02.920
and calls for shunning, subordination, or even violence.

22:02.920 --> 22:07.920
Whereas indirect bigotry manifests as concern or debate

22:08.040 --> 22:09.420
about a host of proxy issues.

22:09.420 --> 22:13.540
It's often defensive in tone rather than offensive.

22:13.540 --> 22:16.360
Frequently, the claim is that a once-needed liberation movement

22:16.360 --> 22:17.860
has now gone too far,

22:17.860 --> 22:20.760
but it's now the activists who are the new oppressors

22:20.760 --> 22:22.260
who are disturbing law and order

22:22.260 --> 22:24.200
with violent and chaotic protests,

22:24.200 --> 22:26.760
who are victimizing and silencing innocent people

22:26.760 --> 22:28.040
by calling them bigots,

22:28.040 --> 22:29.600
who are infiltrating the media

22:29.600 --> 22:31.840
and replacing good old-fashioned entertainment

22:31.840 --> 22:34.020
with politically correct propaganda.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.880
And of course, ordinary people are too intimidated

22:36.880 --> 22:39.360
to speak out against it because cancel culture

22:39.360 --> 22:42.500
is out of control and free speech is under attack.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.280
The direct bigot is always frothing at the mouth,

22:45.280 --> 22:49.160
ranting and raving about predators, perverts, invaders,

22:49.160 --> 22:54.160
rapists, brutish animals, vermin, rats, roaches, contagions.

22:54.780 --> 22:58.920
Whereas the indirect bigot is always defending something,

22:58.920 --> 23:01.940
always a knight in shining armor, defending women,

23:01.940 --> 23:04.260
defending the children, defending marriage,

23:04.260 --> 23:06.580
defending freedom, defending the family,

23:06.580 --> 23:07.860
defending our values, defending common sense,

23:07.860 --> 23:08.860
defending our values, defending common sense,

23:09.360 --> 23:13.060
defending tradition, defending civilization itself,

23:14.200 --> 23:16.320
defending God.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.680
He's all powerful, but he could really use your help, Mary.

23:18.680 --> 23:19.940
I think a lot of people

23:19.940 --> 23:22.880
take a borderline heroic view of themselves,

23:22.880 --> 23:26.500
and indirect bigotry flatters that self-image.

23:26.500 --> 23:30.280
Indirect bigotry often replaces the actual people it targets

23:30.280 --> 23:32.920
with some big abstract concept.

23:32.920 --> 23:34.480
Instead of Jewish people,

23:34.480 --> 23:37.780
they claim to be against Zionist-occupied government.

23:37.780 --> 23:38.880
Instead of women,

23:38.880 --> 23:42.380
they claim to hate feminazis, or the friend zone.

23:42.380 --> 23:45.980
Gay people are depersonified as the gay agenda.

23:45.980 --> 23:50.440
Trans people become transgenderism, gender ideology,

23:50.440 --> 23:52.360
trans activists.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.100
What they're really against is equality,

23:55.100 --> 23:56.320
but they don't say that.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.020
In fact, they may not even think it.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.780
But they tell on themselves

24:00.780 --> 24:03.340
when they react with instinctive hostility

24:03.340 --> 24:05.640
to anyone who agitates for change.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.880
It's not racist to think that Black Lives Matter,

24:08.880 --> 24:10.600
or any of their friends,

24:10.600 --> 24:12.500
are just a bunch of thugs

24:12.500 --> 24:15.380
that shouldn't disrespect the national anthem.

24:15.380 --> 24:17.760
A book called The Anatomy of Prejudices

24:17.760 --> 24:20.760
by Elizabeth Young Brule really helped me with this video.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.360
One of the points she makes is that a lot of the time,

24:23.360 --> 24:25.420
bigotry is backlash.

24:25.420 --> 24:28.500
Ideologies of desire are, generally,

24:28.500 --> 24:31.500
backlashes against movements of equality.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.700
They are regressive prejudices

24:33.700 --> 24:36.780
that reinstate inequalities and distinctions,

24:36.780 --> 24:38.720
when the force of movements for equality,

24:38.720 --> 24:42.020
and, often unconsciously, rejected.

24:42.020 --> 24:45.780
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

24:45.780 --> 24:48.680
Bigotry is not just the psychological state

24:48.680 --> 24:50.700
of hating a group of people.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.560
Bigotry is political.

24:52.560 --> 24:56.040
It's a reaction to changing demographics,

24:56.040 --> 24:57.860
or to liberation movements,

24:57.860 --> 25:00.760
or to changing power relations between groups.

25:00.760 --> 25:04.400
A lot of casual misogynists don't exactly hate women

25:04.400 --> 25:06.440
in the literal psychological sense.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.540
It's more that they feel threatened,

25:08.540 --> 25:13.540
by the prospect of the social and political equality of women.

25:13.540 --> 25:16.760
In fact, I would argue that feeling threatened

25:16.760 --> 25:20.100
is the distinctive psychological experience of bigotry,

25:20.100 --> 25:22.660
much more so than feeling hateful.

25:22.660 --> 25:26.040
So bigotry is reactive, and it changes,

25:26.040 --> 25:29.160
along with the circumstances it's a reaction to.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.580
1950s misogyny still has some things in common

25:32.580 --> 25:34.180
with 2020s misogyny.

25:34.180 --> 25:36.860
For example, a lot of men still feel some need

25:36.860 --> 25:38.420
to control women's sexuality,

25:38.420 --> 25:40.080
and women's bodies.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.640
But it's also changed a lot,

25:41.640 --> 25:45.360
as gender relations have shifted in the last 70 years.

25:45.360 --> 25:47.300
The idea that women are naturally suited

25:47.300 --> 25:49.800
to domestic servitude is a lot less prevalent

25:49.800 --> 25:50.760
than it used to be.

25:50.760 --> 25:54.180
And transphobia is a prejudice that's getting much louder,

25:54.180 --> 25:55.840
because in the last decade,

25:55.840 --> 25:59.000
trans liberation has increased our visibility.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.940
People are running into us at work now.

26:00.940 --> 26:02.920
They're having to use our pronouns.

26:02.920 --> 26:05.580
They're seeing us in politics or in media,

26:05.580 --> 26:08.140
and not just as laughing stocks or monsters

26:08.140 --> 26:10.720
like we used to be, but as actual characters.

26:10.720 --> 26:14.380
And a lot of people are not very happy about it.

26:14.380 --> 26:16.760
They feel threatened.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.920
That must be super fucking hard for you.

26:18.920 --> 26:22.960
Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.

26:22.960 --> 26:25.720
So JK Rowling frames her position as,

26:25.720 --> 26:29.260
I am just saying the fact that sex is real.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.800
It's not hateful to say a fact.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.120
Why is everyone so mad at me?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.500
A fact can't be bigoted.

26:36.500 --> 26:37.440
And I agree.

26:38.140 --> 26:40.060
That a fact cannot be bigoted,

26:40.060 --> 26:44.700
but a fact on its own doesn't mean very much.

26:44.700 --> 26:46.440
Usually when we discuss facts,

26:46.440 --> 26:49.420
we're using those facts to tell a story.

26:49.420 --> 26:54.100
And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.

26:54.100 --> 26:56.520
You know, suppose someone tweets the fact

26:56.520 --> 26:59.560
that the homicide rate is higher for black Americans

26:59.560 --> 27:01.380
than white Americans.

27:01.380 --> 27:02.320
I'm gonna ask,

27:02.320 --> 27:06.340
what story are you trying to tell with this fact?

27:06.340 --> 27:07.760
What political goal are you trying to tell

27:07.760 --> 27:08.100
with this fact?

27:08.100 --> 27:09.780
trying to support.

27:09.780 --> 27:18.060
One way indirect bigotry works is by camouflaging political struggles as intellectual debates.

27:18.060 --> 27:25.040
When Joanne says sex is real, she sounds like she's staking out a position in the trans

27:25.040 --> 27:31.760
debate, which is then presented as an intellectual conflict about the metaphysics of gender instead

27:31.760 --> 27:37.720
of what it really is, which is a political conflict about the social equality of transgender

27:37.720 --> 27:38.760
people.

27:38.760 --> 27:43.460
And the effectiveness of that strategy is actually a reason I'm not a huge fan of

27:43.460 --> 27:46.000
the slogan, trans women are women.

27:46.000 --> 27:50.180
And this is just my opinion, I don't speak for any other trans people, but there's

27:50.180 --> 27:52.240
a couple things I don't like about it.

27:52.240 --> 27:57.240
One is trans men and non-binary people matter just as much as trans women, which you don't

27:57.240 --> 28:02.880
as often hear, trans men are men, or non-binary people are...

28:04.740 --> 28:05.740
valid?

28:05.740 --> 28:08.840
Doesn't really work, does it?

28:08.840 --> 28:14.680
The other problem with trans women are women is it tends to invite the response, well what

28:14.680 --> 28:16.500
does it even mean to be a woman?

28:16.500 --> 28:18.040
Define woman-head.

28:18.040 --> 28:23.440
And now you're immediately getting baited into some bullshit semantic debate about what

28:23.440 --> 28:25.380
is a real woman.

28:25.380 --> 28:26.380
A real woman.

28:26.380 --> 28:28.540
How do you know you're a real woman, Amber?

28:28.540 --> 28:32.900
What if you're in the Matrix right now, and in the real world you're biologically male?

28:32.900 --> 28:34.700
The tables are turned.

28:34.700 --> 28:35.700
It doesn't really matter.

28:35.740 --> 28:36.740
That's it.

28:36.740 --> 28:40.520
This is metaphysics, and life is too short for metaphysics.

28:40.520 --> 28:43.980
You know I've been down this road too many times already, and I always end up having

28:43.980 --> 28:49.060
these dead-end conversations about gender performativity, or worse, conversations about

28:49.060 --> 28:50.740
what it means to feel like a woman.

28:50.740 --> 28:53.240
Well the truth is, I don't feel like a woman.

28:53.240 --> 28:59.020
I don't think anyone feels like a woman honestly, except a certain sub-genre of gay men, and

28:59.020 --> 29:00.860
possibly Shania Twain.

29:00.860 --> 29:04.600
Probably not even her anymore honestly, not since the early 2000s.

29:04.600 --> 29:05.600
You know some questions?

29:05.600 --> 29:06.600
Like, how do you know you're a woman?

29:06.600 --> 29:07.600
How do you know you're a woman?

29:07.600 --> 29:08.600
It's a very complex question.

29:08.600 --> 29:09.600
The only way to answer this should be dissolved rather than solved.

29:09.600 --> 29:10.600
That's what Wittgenstein said.

29:10.600 --> 29:11.600
That's right, we're dragging Ludwig into this.

29:11.600 --> 29:16.840
Sometimes the only way to answer a question is to realize you're asking the wrong question.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.980
How do I know I'm a woman?

29:18.980 --> 29:21.140
Well look at me.

29:21.140 --> 29:23.060
I rest.

29:23.060 --> 29:25.520
My case.

29:25.520 --> 29:26.840
The monitor's over here.

29:26.840 --> 29:28.740
That's what I'm looking at when I look over here.

29:28.740 --> 29:31.880
I like to check in occasionally, see how I'm doing.

29:31.880 --> 29:34.600
Look trans people can't even agree among ourselves what gender is.

29:34.600 --> 29:35.600
No.

29:35.600 --> 29:40.040
even try to answer the question, you end up enraging some part of the community who feels

29:40.040 --> 29:45.440
excluded. So no, trans people are not trying to force an ideology on people. We don't even share

29:45.440 --> 29:50.380
an ideology within our own community. What we share are a common set of political struggles

29:50.380 --> 29:57.040
against discrimination, against harassment, against excessive medical gatekeeping, against

29:57.040 --> 30:03.660
exclusion from public life. So what would be a better slogan than trans women are women? Well,

30:03.660 --> 30:10.440
ideally something that includes all trans people and something that evades pointless philosophizing

30:10.440 --> 30:17.500
about biology and what is gender and who is true trans and what is a woman really. Something that

30:17.500 --> 30:22.700
centers what actually matters, which is freeing trans people from the stigma and discrimination

30:22.700 --> 30:27.940
that have historically prevented us from becoming equal members of society. So I know it sounds kind

30:27.940 --> 30:32.880
of outdated, very 1970s, but I personally like the slogan,

30:33.160 --> 30:33.640
Trans Living.

30:33.660 --> 30:38.920
Liberation now. It's short, it's sweet, and instead of prompting, define womanhood,

30:39.300 --> 30:44.680
it prompts people to ask, what do you mean liberation? Liberation from what? And then you

30:44.680 --> 30:50.180
can say, well, I'll tell you. And now you're talking about politics instead of talking about

30:50.180 --> 30:55.580
semantics. Isn't that better? I feel like trans culture is just so obsessed with reassuring

30:55.580 --> 31:00.900
ourselves that we are valid that we sometimes forget that the end goal of a political movement

31:00.900 --> 31:03.640
is not validity. It's equality.

31:04.300 --> 31:09.100
That's what we're supposed to be fighting for. So instead of asking, does JK Rowling think we're

31:09.100 --> 31:14.700
valid? Which like, who fucking cares if she thinks we're valid? Well, maybe I care a little bit. But

31:14.700 --> 31:21.000
instead, why don't we ask, is she or is she not an ally in our struggle for equality? Doesn't that

31:21.000 --> 31:26.320
just bring reality back into focus? Isn't it so much better to have a concrete political project

31:26.320 --> 31:32.220
in front of you instead of sinking into this scholastic gender theology? Trans people are a

31:32.220 --> 31:33.540
population of people.

31:33.660 --> 31:39.420
Who have a right to equality and to freedom from discrimination. We are not an ideology

31:39.420 --> 31:45.600
that's up for debate. But that's how JK Rowling frames the trans question. Not as a struggle

31:45.600 --> 31:52.380
for equality that she opposes, but as an ideology that she disagrees with. I'm just saying that

31:52.380 --> 31:56.380
sex is real. Is that all you're saying, Joanne?

32:03.660 --> 32:14.960
Remember that scene in the Goblet of Fire in the Prefect's bathroom? moaning Myrtle,

32:14.960 --> 32:20.520
hey how are you? I wonder if that inspired my love of baths. This bath is actually really nice.

32:20.520 --> 32:26.880
It's a lot of milk and a lot of rose oil, Epsom salts. Just kind of everything that's good in baths

32:26.880 --> 32:32.060
all together. I don't wanna talk about bigotry. I wanna talk about baths. Can this just be a video

32:32.060 --> 32:33.260
about baths from now on? Well, okay that's researched. Guys, we're gonna talk about that lamps. Have

32:33.260 --> 32:33.500
a nice day. Bye-bye.

32:34.460 --> 32:39.740
oh fine i'll do my job on june 10 jk rowling published an essay to her website which on

32:39.740 --> 32:45.020
twitter she titled turf wars which was just awarded the russell prize by the bbc for its

32:45.660 --> 32:50.860
brave display of unyielding transphobia i guess the essay is several pages long and outlines her

32:50.860 --> 32:56.300
reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues i refuse to bow down to a movement

32:56.300 --> 33:01.740
that i believe is doing demonstrable harm in seeking to erode women as a political and

33:01.740 --> 33:07.260
biological class and offering to cover predators like few before it where do i even begin with this

33:07.260 --> 33:16.300
one well let's pick some highlights woman is not a costume woman is not an idea in a man's head woman

33:16.300 --> 33:24.300
is not a pink brain a liking for jimmy chews or any of the other sexist ideas now somehow touted

33:24.300 --> 33:30.620
as progressive oh well my mistake here i was thinking i was a woman it turns out i'm just a

33:30.620 --> 33:31.660
man who likes expensive shoes

33:31.740 --> 33:37.260
what a whimsical misunderstanding okay well that's it everyone the channel's over thanks

33:37.260 --> 33:41.900
for the likes and comments i'm gonna head out now to the uh the jimmy choo store and

33:43.180 --> 33:50.540
then i guess i'll cut my tits off joanne joanne this is madness joanne

33:50.540 --> 33:56.060
when you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels

33:56.060 --> 34:01.660
he's a woman and as i've said gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without

34:01.740 --> 34:07.100
any pre-existing requirements for handshaking places like judging processes or homes Millions

34:07.100 --> 34:11.980
have heritage history covering our plight resisting the sexual taboos and abusingsama

34:11.980 --> 34:16.860
lynchings in unconscious terms and if they niinro you deny their existence the new opens

34:16.860 --> 34:22.380
up the door to any and all men who wish to get introduced so look i understand that some women

34:22.380 --> 34:26.940
are anxious about the thought of predators in bathrooms and believe me i don't want to

34:26.940 --> 34:28.340
share a bathroom with a predator any more than you do why are all my rose petals on this one side come some of them need to come over here

34:28.340 --> 34:29.180
come here i've redistributed the petals socialist icon but this talking point that gender change on legal documents will enable predators to enter relations away from different countries will kill women if you are welcome not a woman that comes into a group would turn women into men's seafood and take men into..."

34:29.180 --> 34:29.740
...accutest savings begins to be banished by caused by금 sociaux...

34:29.740 --> 34:35.140
documents will enable predators to enter bathrooms it doesn't really make sense because gender

34:35.140 --> 34:40.760
policing in public bathrooms doesn't involve legal documents like when was the last time you had to

34:40.760 --> 34:45.720
present a gender certificate to gain admittance to a public bathroom this feels like a strangely

34:45.720 --> 34:50.900
outdated conversation to be having during pandemic lockdown like imagine using a public bathroom

34:50.900 --> 34:55.820
imagine being in public i've been reading this book called female masculinity which is about

34:55.820 --> 35:00.500
the experiences of butch women and there's a section here called the bathroom problem which

35:00.500 --> 35:06.760
describes how women's bathrooms tend to operate as an area for the enforcement of gender conformity

35:06.760 --> 35:11.060
the author jack halberstam who's assigned female at birth and presents masculine

35:11.060 --> 35:17.340
describes routinely having security called in him for using the women's bathroom having one's gender

35:17.340 --> 35:22.940
challenged in the women's restroom is a frequent occurrence in the lives of many androgynous or

35:22.940 --> 35:25.620
masculine women indeed it is so

35:25.620 --> 35:25.800
challenging that it's so important to have a feminine bathroom and

35:25.800 --> 35:25.820
having a feminine bathroom and having a feminine sangat as well is so important to me because

35:25.820 --> 35:28.860
that one wonders whether the category woman,

35:28.860 --> 35:31.200
when used to designate public functions,

35:31.200 --> 35:33.040
is completely outmoded.

35:33.040 --> 35:35.800
Queer literature is littered with references

35:35.800 --> 35:37.740
to the bathroom problem,

35:37.740 --> 35:39.680
and it would not be an exaggeration

35:39.680 --> 35:43.040
to call it a standard feature of the butch narrative.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.180
And that's very interesting to me

35:44.180 --> 35:46.680
because as a feminine trans woman,

35:46.680 --> 35:48.680
I have not once been questioned

35:48.680 --> 35:50.240
or had the authorities called on me

35:50.240 --> 35:52.080
in a women's public bathroom,

35:52.080 --> 35:54.040
and the entire time I've been using them,

35:54.040 --> 35:55.860
which is several years now.

35:55.860 --> 35:59.620
So when Joanne Rowling, a feminine heterosexual woman,

35:59.620 --> 36:01.680
calls for more bathroom policing

36:01.680 --> 36:04.480
to protect the lesbians or whatever,

36:04.480 --> 36:06.180
it just seems ignorant

36:06.180 --> 36:08.540
of the way bathroom policing actually works.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.740
Like, is she just so famous

36:10.740 --> 36:12.720
that she doesn't use public bathrooms anymore

36:12.720 --> 36:14.480
and she forgot how they work?

36:14.480 --> 36:17.660
How much could one bathroom entry certificate cost, Michael?

36:17.660 --> 36:18.820
$10?

36:18.820 --> 36:21.700
Women's bathrooms are policed according to femininity,

36:21.700 --> 36:23.160
not chromosomes,

36:23.160 --> 36:24.020
and there's no practical reason

36:24.020 --> 36:25.040
for people to change that

36:25.040 --> 36:28.440
short of stationing a genital inspector in every stall,

36:28.440 --> 36:31.660
you know, just to make sure no one's privacy is violated.

36:31.660 --> 36:36.400
That's a very good idea, Joanne.

36:36.400 --> 36:39.260
That's very good.

36:39.260 --> 36:41.140
Ironically, radical feminists

36:41.140 --> 36:42.900
aren't even trans-exclusionary.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.380
They include trans men in their feminism

36:45.380 --> 36:47.560
because they were born women.

36:47.560 --> 36:51.820
Isn't it ironic that supposedly transphobic feminists

36:51.820 --> 36:53.840
think that trans men are women?

36:53.840 --> 36:57.640
Hello, operator, could you get me Alanis Morissette?

36:57.640 --> 36:59.740
I have a new incident to report.

36:59.740 --> 37:03.080
So look, I could keep refuting points made in Turf Wars,

37:03.080 --> 37:04.400
which is basically just a series

37:04.400 --> 37:06.000
of common transphobic canards

37:06.000 --> 37:07.660
we've all heard a hundred times before,

37:07.660 --> 37:10.520
but I want to focus in particular on some passages

37:10.520 --> 37:11.920
that I think are very revealing

37:11.920 --> 37:14.080
about the psychology of transphobia.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.240
What is it about the transgenders

37:16.240 --> 37:18.500
that some people feel threatened by?

37:18.500 --> 37:21.180
Well, Joanne Rowling gives us a lot to work with

37:21.180 --> 37:22.600
in answering that question.

37:22.600 --> 37:23.840
You know, Joanne being a TERF,

37:23.840 --> 37:25.860
is mostly terrible for trans people,

37:25.860 --> 37:28.080
but maybe the silver lining

37:28.080 --> 37:30.440
is that the most famous novelist in the world

37:30.440 --> 37:33.000
having a public transphobic breakdown

37:33.000 --> 37:35.420
is providing a wealth of insight

37:35.420 --> 37:38.000
about the interior world of a transphobe.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.220
In Turf Wars, Joanne claims her interest

37:40.220 --> 37:44.060
in the trans issue is intensely personal,

37:44.060 --> 37:46.020
and she has two reasons why it's personal.

37:46.020 --> 37:49.520
The first is she thinks that if she had been a child today,

37:49.520 --> 37:51.080
she would have been transed.

37:51.080 --> 37:52.400
Someone would have transed her.

37:52.400 --> 37:53.680
You know, people are being transed

37:53.680 --> 37:55.240
to left and right these days.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.160
It's a reasonable thing to be concerned about.

37:57.160 --> 37:59.100
Trans people, we're always on the lookout

37:59.100 --> 38:01.120
for the next person we can trans.

38:01.120 --> 38:03.880
So all we want to do is trans people.

38:03.880 --> 38:08.040
I transed four people this morning before I ate breakfast.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.940
She thinks that she would have been recruited

38:09.940 --> 38:12.920
by the transsexual empire and forced to take hormones

38:12.920 --> 38:15.400
by the dark cabal of endocrinologists.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.060
And in support of this speculation,

38:17.060 --> 38:19.300
Joanne rehashes a bunch of transphobic tropes

38:19.300 --> 38:21.160
about social contagion and to quote,

38:21.160 --> 38:22.800
4,400% increase in goblins.

38:22.800 --> 38:23.660
4,400% increase in goblins.

38:23.660 --> 38:26.220
Girls being referred for transitioning treatment.

38:26.220 --> 38:28.100
And that sounds pretty alarming, right?

38:28.100 --> 38:29.880
4,400%.

38:29.880 --> 38:32.540
But you have to keep in mind that 10 years ago,

38:32.540 --> 38:36.500
only 32 assigned female patients under 18 were referred.

38:36.500 --> 38:40.240
And by last year, that number was 1,740,

38:40.240 --> 38:42.620
with the biggest increase happening five years ago.

38:42.620 --> 38:45.300
You know, the transgender tipping point year.

38:45.300 --> 38:46.760
So that is a big increase,

38:46.760 --> 38:49.100
but it corresponds to the biggest ever increase

38:49.100 --> 38:50.460
in trans visibility.

38:50.460 --> 38:52.060
So it does make sense.

38:52.060 --> 38:53.460
And there's 11 million children,

38:53.460 --> 38:54.900
in the UK.

38:54.900 --> 38:59.900
So let's say 5.5 million girls and 1,740 is 0.03% of that.

39:03.080 --> 39:05.560
And considering that around 1% of adults

39:05.560 --> 39:07.060
are some kind of transgender,

39:07.060 --> 39:12.060
0.03% of kids is not really an alarming number to me.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.920
If anything, you'd expect it to be higher.

39:14.920 --> 39:17.020
But part of Joanne's problem here

39:17.020 --> 39:19.360
is that she seems not to really understand

39:19.360 --> 39:21.080
what being trans is.

39:21.080 --> 39:23.300
The writings of young trans men reveal a group of trans women

39:23.300 --> 39:25.640
in a group of notably sensitive and clever people.

39:25.640 --> 39:29.080
The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I've read,

39:29.080 --> 39:31.960
with their insightful descriptions of anxiety,

39:31.960 --> 39:36.640
dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm, and self-hatred,

39:36.640 --> 39:38.300
the more I've wondered whether,

39:38.300 --> 39:40.680
if I'd been born 30 years later,

39:40.680 --> 39:42.820
I too might have tried to transition.

39:42.820 --> 39:46.020
The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.760
If I had found community and sympathy online

39:48.760 --> 39:51.240
that I couldn't find in my immediate environment,

39:51.240 --> 39:53.080
I believe I could have been persuaded

39:53.080 --> 39:54.800
to turn myself into the son

39:54.800 --> 39:58.020
my father had openly said he'd have preferred.

39:58.020 --> 40:01.140
Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness

40:01.140 --> 40:03.420
and my ambivalence about being a woman

40:03.420 --> 40:07.140
reflected in the work of female writers and musicians

40:07.140 --> 40:09.840
who reassured me that, in spite of everything,

40:09.840 --> 40:13.480
a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied.

40:13.480 --> 40:15.980
It's fine not to feel pink, frilly,

40:15.980 --> 40:17.840
and compliant inside your own head.

40:17.840 --> 40:22.840
It's okay to feel confused, dark, both sexual and non-sexual.

40:23.080 --> 40:26.380
It's okay to feel unsure of what or who you are.

40:26.380 --> 40:30.180
Okay, so there's a lot to unpack here,

40:30.180 --> 40:31.820
and let's start by making a list

40:31.820 --> 40:35.380
of things being a transgender man is not.

40:35.380 --> 40:38.400
Having anxiety, having dissociation,

40:38.400 --> 40:41.480
having an eating disorder, doing self-harm,

40:41.480 --> 40:43.760
doing self-hatred, a viable way

40:43.760 --> 40:46.260
to make your sexist father proud,

40:46.260 --> 40:49.300
not feeling pink, not feeling frilly,

40:49.300 --> 40:53.040
not being compliant, feeling confused,

40:53.080 --> 40:58.080
feeling dark, feeling sexual, feeling non-sexual,

40:58.900 --> 41:01.620
feeling unsure of who you are.

41:01.620 --> 41:05.480
Okay, so you can be a trans man and experience some

41:05.480 --> 41:07.220
or even all of these things,

41:07.220 --> 41:11.420
but none of these things are what being a trans man is.

41:11.420 --> 41:14.880
Wanting to take testosterone to masculinize your body

41:14.880 --> 41:17.500
and literally live your life as a man

41:17.500 --> 41:19.800
is not the same as the typical struggles

41:19.800 --> 41:21.040
other girls go through.

41:21.040 --> 41:23.080
Joanne is projecting her own memories

41:23.080 --> 41:25.540
of troubled adolescence onto trans men,

41:25.540 --> 41:27.920
and then saying, oh, clearly they were going

41:27.920 --> 41:29.280
through the same things I was,

41:29.280 --> 41:32.920
just someone persuaded them to transition.

41:32.920 --> 41:34.840
It's a limitation of human empathy

41:34.840 --> 41:37.600
that sometimes when we're trying to understand

41:37.600 --> 41:39.360
what someone else is feeling,

41:39.360 --> 41:43.580
the best we can do is to project our feelings onto them.

41:43.580 --> 41:46.140
And sometimes that's a misrepresentation.

41:46.140 --> 41:48.680
Sometimes other people are experiencing things

41:48.680 --> 41:50.820
that we have never experienced.

41:50.820 --> 41:52.900
So we have to be aware of that.

41:52.900 --> 41:55.240
We have to invent explanations

41:55.240 --> 41:58.740
about why they're not behaving the way we think they should.

41:58.740 --> 42:01.600
Someone is persuading them to transition.

42:01.600 --> 42:04.500
But this fear mongering about kids being persuaded

42:04.500 --> 42:07.560
to transition is just not how things work.

42:07.560 --> 42:09.220
From the way transphobes talk about it,

42:09.220 --> 42:11.360
you'd think whenever a little girl on the playground

42:11.360 --> 42:12.720
picks up a toy truck,

42:12.720 --> 42:16.220
an endocrinologist pops out from behind a tree and says,

42:16.220 --> 42:18.620
we've got a nonconformist on our hands, Johnson.

42:18.620 --> 42:20.580
Stand by, I'm gonna trans him.

42:21.560 --> 42:22.640
But this is the narrative

42:22.900 --> 42:24.280
transphobes are pushing,

42:24.280 --> 42:27.260
in particular about young transmasculine people.

42:27.260 --> 42:30.300
Last year, a transphobic screed of a book came out

42:30.300 --> 42:32.660
that is essentially to transmasculine people

42:32.660 --> 42:35.400
what the transsexual empire was to trans women.

42:35.400 --> 42:38.000
It's called Irreversible Damage,

42:38.000 --> 42:41.820
The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters.

42:41.820 --> 42:44.620
Chapter one, the contagion.

42:44.620 --> 42:45.520
Jesus.

42:45.520 --> 42:48.060
Laying it on a little thick, don't you think, Abigail?

42:48.060 --> 42:50.680
The argument is that female to male transgenderism

42:50.680 --> 42:52.900
is an infectious social disease.

42:52.900 --> 42:55.160
Which is literally the argument Hitler made

42:55.160 --> 42:58.460
about homosexuality, but okay, great.

42:58.460 --> 43:01.640
I think a major problem with media coverage of trans issues

43:01.640 --> 43:03.560
is that not enough attention is paid

43:03.560 --> 43:06.240
to transphobia against trans men.

43:06.240 --> 43:08.260
Like after the J.K. Rowling story broke,

43:08.260 --> 43:10.160
Daniel Radcliffe came out and said,

43:10.160 --> 43:12.080
transgender women are women.

43:12.080 --> 43:13.580
And that's very nice of him,

43:13.580 --> 43:17.120
but a huge section of Joanne's essay is about trans men.

43:17.120 --> 43:20.200
In fact, she spends more words on trans men

43:20.200 --> 43:21.660
than on any other topic.

43:21.660 --> 43:22.740
So I think it's worth looking in particular.

43:22.740 --> 43:24.600
at that.

43:24.600 --> 43:28.360
Something I've noticed is transphobia against trans men

43:28.360 --> 43:31.460
is not the same as transphobia against trans women.

43:31.460 --> 43:32.780
There's a lot of similarities,

43:32.780 --> 43:35.160
but they're really two different prejudices.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.600
And they come from different psychological places.

43:37.600 --> 43:39.820
In the same way that lesbophobia is different

43:39.820 --> 43:41.740
from homophobia against gay men.

43:41.740 --> 43:44.420
For trans women, I would say the distinctive experience

43:44.420 --> 43:47.840
of transphobia is being simultaneously treated

43:47.840 --> 43:51.020
as a pornographic female fetish object

43:51.020 --> 43:52.120
and

43:52.120 --> 43:54.060
as a dangerous male predator.

43:54.060 --> 43:55.520
The ultimate sex demon,

43:55.520 --> 43:58.320
this kind of incubus succubus who will

43:58.320 --> 44:00.720
ravish your wife and trap your husband.

44:00.720 --> 44:02.980
Your polygamous commune will be devastated.

44:02.980 --> 44:06.400
Whereas I feel like trans masculine people are less vilified,

44:06.400 --> 44:08.940
but so infantilized.

44:08.940 --> 44:11.520
I guess transphobes view trans men as women,

44:11.520 --> 44:14.840
so a lot of misogynistic tropes still apply.

44:14.840 --> 44:17.040
So much for transitioning to escape sexism.

44:17.040 --> 44:21.500
The story is often that these vulnerable, confused girls

44:21.500 --> 44:23.480
can't possibly decide for themselves

44:23.480 --> 44:25.180
what to do with their own bodies,

44:25.180 --> 44:27.580
so the courts must intervene to take control.

44:27.580 --> 44:29.960
Which is exactly what just happened in the UK,

44:29.960 --> 44:32.100
where trans youth under 16 will now need

44:32.100 --> 44:34.020
not only the approval of a doctor,

44:34.020 --> 44:35.680
but will need to seek a court order

44:35.680 --> 44:37.480
in order to get puberty blockers.

44:37.480 --> 44:39.260
And the justification given for this

44:39.260 --> 44:42.600
mirrored exactly Joanne's concerns

44:42.600 --> 44:45.760
about fragile, vulnerable teenage girls

44:45.760 --> 44:48.240
being unable to make informed decisions.

44:48.240 --> 44:49.940
In her essay, Joanne says,

44:49.940 --> 44:53.220
I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman

44:53.220 --> 44:55.920
who's older than I am and wonderful.

44:55.920 --> 44:58.400
Although she's open about her past as a gay man,

44:58.400 --> 45:00.260
I've always found it hard to think of her

45:00.260 --> 45:01.960
as anything other than a woman.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.420
Being older, though, she went through a long

45:04.420 --> 45:07.120
and rigorous process of evaluation,

45:07.120 --> 45:09.980
psychotherapy, and staged transformation.

45:09.980 --> 45:12.140
The current explosion of trans activism

45:12.140 --> 45:16.160
is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems

45:16.160 --> 45:18.720
through which candidates for sex reassignment

45:18.720 --> 45:19.920
were once required to pass.

45:19.940 --> 45:21.600
So that's what she wants.

45:21.600 --> 45:25.360
She wants robust systems of medical gatekeeping,

45:25.360 --> 45:27.740
which is the same thing Janice Raymond wants,

45:27.740 --> 45:30.320
just Joanne's more polite about it.

45:30.320 --> 45:31.420
I want to make a drink.

45:35.700 --> 45:37.660
Sometimes people ask me if I used to be a bartender.

45:37.660 --> 45:39.320
No, just drank a lot.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.300
Ugh, we're revealing leg again.

45:41.300 --> 45:42.160
The scandal.

45:42.160 --> 45:45.900
Putting a wet, white chiffon thing over it

45:45.900 --> 45:48.420
is that much more chaste.

45:48.420 --> 45:49.220
Well, I'm an extremely chaste woman.

45:49.220 --> 45:52.800
I try to honor God with my body.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.780
That's why I got a sex change.

45:54.780 --> 45:57.680
I'm honoring God with my sex change.

45:57.680 --> 45:58.880
I'm not drunk enough for this.

45:58.880 --> 46:01.920
So I also want to point out that cis men and cis women

46:01.920 --> 46:04.600
are often transphobic for different reasons.

46:04.600 --> 46:07.540
A lot of cis men are transphobic against trans women

46:07.540 --> 46:11.120
because the thought that a man can become a woman

46:11.120 --> 46:13.800
threatens the certainty of their own manhood.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.720
It's similar to the reason a lot of straight men

46:15.720 --> 46:16.900
are homophobic.

46:16.900 --> 46:18.980
They feel their own masculinity is threatened,

46:18.980 --> 46:21.500
and of course, a lot of straight men

46:21.500 --> 46:22.940
are attracted to trans women,

46:22.940 --> 46:25.260
and they feel that that attraction threatens

46:25.260 --> 46:27.420
their identity as straight men.

46:27.420 --> 46:30.320
Back in my comphet days when I dated men,

46:30.320 --> 46:32.680
for a couple straight guys I hooked up with,

46:32.680 --> 46:36.060
going down on me was like crossing the fucking Rubicon.

46:36.060 --> 46:37.460
This is it, Mr. Frodo.

46:37.460 --> 46:38.960
If I take one more step,

46:38.960 --> 46:41.720
I'll be the farthest from heterosexual I've ever been.

46:41.720 --> 46:44.780
Okay, Samwise, whatever you need to tell yourself.

46:44.780 --> 46:47.700
And afterwards, they go into this whole Cartesian spiral.

46:47.700 --> 46:48.620
What have I done?

46:48.980 --> 46:50.400
What does this mean?

46:50.400 --> 46:51.300
Who am I?

46:51.300 --> 46:53.220
I think for a lot of cis women,

46:53.220 --> 46:55.840
the very existence of trans men

46:55.840 --> 46:58.440
sends them into a similar identity crisis.

46:58.440 --> 47:00.860
I think a lot of women have had to fight

47:00.860 --> 47:03.000
a really difficult internal battle

47:03.000 --> 47:04.980
to make peace with their own womanhood.

47:04.980 --> 47:06.300
And for some women,

47:06.300 --> 47:10.100
confronting the existence of transgender people

47:10.100 --> 47:12.480
seems to open some old wounds.

47:12.480 --> 47:14.020
Like I've noticed in particular

47:14.020 --> 47:17.160
that some of the most virulent and obsessive TERFs

47:17.160 --> 47:18.540
are older lesbian women,

47:18.540 --> 47:21.480
on the more butch side of things.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.880
And these women see hyper-feminine trans women

47:23.880 --> 47:25.300
in makeup and dresses,

47:25.300 --> 47:26.140
and they say,

47:26.140 --> 47:28.900
that is not what being a woman is.

47:28.900 --> 47:31.660
I've had to fight for my own identity

47:31.660 --> 47:35.040
against the idea that that's what being a woman is.

47:35.040 --> 47:37.300
These are just misogynistic stereotypes.

47:37.300 --> 47:39.560
You are a parody of womanhood.

47:39.560 --> 47:40.780
You're a fetishist.

47:40.780 --> 47:42.480
And when they see trans men,

47:42.480 --> 47:44.320
they say, you're a traitor.

47:44.320 --> 47:45.740
You're a self-loather.

47:45.740 --> 47:48.220
Why can't you learn to accept yourself as a woman,

47:48.220 --> 47:49.800
the way I've had to?

47:49.800 --> 47:52.160
But this is all projection and misunderstanding.

47:52.160 --> 47:53.800
Trans women do not think

47:53.800 --> 47:56.580
that wearing dresses is what makes us women.

47:56.580 --> 47:58.380
And trans men do not think

47:58.380 --> 48:01.440
that not feeling pink, frilly, and compliant

48:01.440 --> 48:02.800
is what makes them men.

48:02.800 --> 48:05.500
These are meanings that JK Rowling is assigning

48:05.500 --> 48:08.180
to trans people's actions in her own brain,

48:08.180 --> 48:09.960
because she perceives our lives

48:09.960 --> 48:12.460
as some kind of commentary on gender,

48:12.460 --> 48:14.580
with an implied ideology

48:14.580 --> 48:16.960
about what it means to be a man or a woman.

48:16.960 --> 48:18.200
But that's your interpretation,

48:18.200 --> 48:19.220
Joanne.

48:19.220 --> 48:22.200
That's a meaning that you are imposing on us,

48:22.200 --> 48:25.700
because it seems you have a lot of traumatic gender baggage

48:25.700 --> 48:26.540
of your own,

48:26.540 --> 48:28.760
and it's interfering with your ability

48:28.760 --> 48:31.380
to genuinely empathize with trans people.

48:31.380 --> 48:32.760
You know, at the end of your essay,

48:32.760 --> 48:35.860
you say that you never forget the inner complexity

48:35.860 --> 48:37.480
when it comes to trans people.

48:37.480 --> 48:38.840
And that's a nice thought,

48:38.840 --> 48:42.560
but until you're actually able to stop seeing trans people

48:42.560 --> 48:46.160
as some kind of like abstract theory of gender,

48:46.160 --> 48:48.080
or as a projection of your own

48:48.080 --> 48:49.160
adolescence,

48:49.160 --> 48:51.400
then you're not really seeing us

48:51.400 --> 48:55.320
as distinct individuals with our own experiences and stories.

48:55.320 --> 48:58.700
And since you're a self-appointed spokesperson

48:58.700 --> 48:59.760
on trans people,

48:59.760 --> 49:01.540
sorry, gender issues,

49:01.540 --> 49:03.080
I think it would be good if you listened

49:03.080 --> 49:06.880
to the experiences of trans men without, for instance,

49:06.880 --> 49:11.180
superimposing your own troubled relationship with your father.

49:11.180 --> 49:14.080
I should probably talk about the book,

49:14.080 --> 49:17.240
since I did go to the trouble to read all 900 pages,

49:17.240 --> 49:20.300
because unlike certain other YouTubers,

49:20.300 --> 49:22.320
I do in fact know how to read.

49:22.320 --> 49:25.240
Troubled Blood was published in September 2020

49:25.240 --> 49:28.560
by Joanne Rowling under her pen name, Robert Galbraith.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.480
You know, for someone apparently so concerned

49:30.480 --> 49:33.940
about her womanhood being erased by the transsexuals,

49:33.940 --> 49:37.600
the fact that she publishes under a male pen name is,

49:37.600 --> 49:38.760
it's interesting.

49:38.760 --> 49:40.360
It's a choice.

49:40.360 --> 49:41.620
God, this thing is huge.

49:41.620 --> 49:43.700
It's like the infinite jest of terfury.

49:43.700 --> 49:46.320
So Troubled Blood is a detective novel about,

49:46.320 --> 49:49.320
about the simmering heterosexual tension

49:49.320 --> 49:51.120
between two investigators.

49:51.120 --> 49:53.400
And that's really what Rowling does best, isn't it?

49:53.400 --> 49:54.560
Simmering.

49:54.560 --> 49:57.100
There's a lot of simmering in the Harry Potter universe,

49:57.100 --> 50:00.700
and a lot of fans who'd like to raise that simmer to a boil.

50:05.960 --> 50:07.680
Hello, Daniel.

50:07.680 --> 50:09.560
I love you, grown-up Harry Potter.

50:09.560 --> 50:12.480
Let me show you my love the only way I know how.

50:16.320 --> 50:21.480
Oh, baby.

50:23.560 --> 50:32.320
Is there going to be discourse about this?

50:32.320 --> 50:39.020
Look, if it's wrong to have compact feelings about Daniel Radcliffe,

50:39.020 --> 50:40.020
I don't want to be right.

50:40.020 --> 50:43.040
I will not be shamed for my shameful fantasies.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.040
Get out of here, Daniel.

50:44.040 --> 50:45.040
This is the final farewell moment.

50:45.040 --> 50:45.960
I love you.

50:45.960 --> 50:47.660
farewell to my heterosexuality.

50:47.660 --> 50:48.820
Goodbye, Daniel!

50:50.360 --> 50:51.820
And your little arm, too.

50:53.360 --> 50:54.740
You stay out of this, Linda.

50:54.740 --> 50:58.160
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.

50:58.160 --> 51:01.920
So the prime suspect in Troubled Blood is Dennis Creed,

51:01.920 --> 51:05.140
a cross-dressing serial killer who dresses as a woman

51:05.140 --> 51:09.040
to lull his victims, whom he abducts, tortures,

51:09.040 --> 51:10.980
rapes, and murders.

51:10.980 --> 51:11.980
Interesting.

51:11.980 --> 51:15.780
Now, I enjoyed this book because, like most women,

51:15.780 --> 51:18.320
I enjoy books about dangerous perverts.

51:18.320 --> 51:21.060
But a lot of trans people, literate trans people,

51:21.060 --> 51:23.260
have called this book transphobic.

51:23.260 --> 51:24.440
And you might think that's unfair,

51:24.440 --> 51:29.120
since the character Dennis Creed, this serial killer,

51:29.120 --> 51:32.020
is a, he's not a trans, he's a cross-dresser.

51:32.020 --> 51:34.080
This has nothing to do with trans people.

51:34.080 --> 51:36.300
Why so triggered, snowflake?

51:36.300 --> 51:38.820
Well, Precious, there's a couple things I think

51:38.820 --> 51:40.940
are worth taking into consideration here.

51:40.940 --> 51:44.900
One is that the transvestite, or transsexual serial killer,

51:44.900 --> 51:46.660
is an old transphobic trope.

51:46.660 --> 51:49.180
It's a cliche that goes back decades.

51:49.180 --> 51:51.780
And I take great offense to the suggestion

51:51.780 --> 51:53.900
that trans women are serial killers,

51:53.900 --> 51:57.780
because I, for one, haven't been caught yet.

51:57.780 --> 52:00.300
The trope seems to originate in 1960

52:00.300 --> 52:02.280
with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

52:02.280 --> 52:03.240
That's just my guess, though.

52:03.240 --> 52:04.460
I haven't researched this.

52:04.460 --> 52:06.140
Who do you think I am, Lindsay Ellis?

52:06.140 --> 52:08.160
So I don't think Psycho is transphobic.

52:08.160 --> 52:10.700
The movie ends with a psychoanalytic summing up,

52:10.700 --> 52:14.260
where the psychiatrist offers this pseudo-Freudian explanation

52:14.260 --> 52:15.740
that Norman cross-dresses

52:15.740 --> 52:18.700
because the personality of his dead mother takes over

52:18.700 --> 52:20.960
and, out of jealousy, kills the women

52:20.960 --> 52:22.520
Norman is attracted to.

52:22.520 --> 52:25.140
Therefore, the psychiatrist explains,

52:25.140 --> 52:28.140
Norman is not a real transvestite.

52:28.140 --> 52:30.340
You're a fake transvestite, Norman.

52:30.340 --> 52:31.620
Trender alert.

52:31.620 --> 52:32.460
But I do think that,

52:32.460 --> 52:34.660
even if Psycho isn't explicitly transphobic,

52:34.660 --> 52:37.380
movies can subconsciously implant ideas

52:37.380 --> 52:39.960
and feelings into our brains.

52:39.960 --> 52:41.740
And I do think it's worth noting

52:41.740 --> 52:44.060
that the most famous and most terrifying

52:44.260 --> 52:46.020
scene in cinema history

52:46.020 --> 52:51.020
is of a man in a dress attacking a woman in a bathroom.

52:51.200 --> 52:53.060
To quote a popular film critic,

52:53.060 --> 52:56.320
you might not have noticed it, but your brain did.

52:56.320 --> 52:57.980
The cross-dressing Psycho trope

52:57.980 --> 52:59.820
became explicitly transphobic

52:59.820 --> 53:03.540
in the campy 1980s Psycho ripoff, Dressed to Kill,

53:03.540 --> 53:06.660
in which Michael Caine plays a transsexual psychiatrist

53:06.660 --> 53:11.660
who, yes, dresses as a woman to kill women he's attracted to.

53:11.660 --> 53:13.440
He was a transsexual.

53:13.440 --> 53:14.260
What?

53:14.260 --> 53:15.260
I'm a transsexual.

53:15.260 --> 53:16.940
You see, there's some men and women, too,

53:16.940 --> 53:18.420
think they're born in the wrong body.

53:18.420 --> 53:20.060
They're called transsexuals,

53:20.060 --> 53:22.680
and all they wanna do is have their sex changed.

53:22.680 --> 53:24.980
It's all they wanna do, the transsexuals.

53:24.980 --> 53:28.380
Dressed to Kill also ends with a psychiatric summing up,

53:28.380 --> 53:30.500
where the doctor explains that Michael Caine

53:30.500 --> 53:34.180
is a case of opposite sexes inhabiting the same body.

53:34.180 --> 53:36.980
But it's the female Michael Caine who kills,

53:36.980 --> 53:38.640
because, and I quote,

53:38.640 --> 53:40.460
Elliot's penis became erect,

53:40.460 --> 53:41.820
and Bobby took control,

53:41.820 --> 53:44.260
trying to kill anyone that made Elliot masculinely,

53:44.260 --> 53:45.100
sexual.

53:45.100 --> 53:46.600
There's often a misogynistic trope

53:46.600 --> 53:48.480
hiding behind the transphobic one.

53:48.480 --> 53:51.760
It's the woman in the man who does the murders.

53:51.760 --> 53:53.180
It's the mother's fault.

53:53.180 --> 53:57.280
His mother was a clinging, demanding woman.

53:57.280 --> 53:59.560
The most mature iteration of this trope,

53:59.560 --> 54:01.720
the crown jewel of transphobic movies,

54:01.720 --> 54:04.260
is, of course, the Silence of the Lambs,

54:04.260 --> 54:06.060
which is honestly one of my favorite movies,

54:06.060 --> 54:08.180
because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins

54:08.180 --> 54:10.200
are just radiant in it,

54:10.200 --> 54:12.260
and also, I hate myself.

54:12.260 --> 54:13.260
Silence of the Lambs is a story that's a little bit more,

54:13.260 --> 54:14.100
I don't know.

54:14.100 --> 54:15.760
It's a story of Buffalo Bill,

54:15.760 --> 54:19.000
an animal lover and innovative seamstress.

54:19.000 --> 54:21.220
Buffalo Bill is a trans-trender.

54:21.220 --> 54:22.480
A trans-trender!

54:22.480 --> 54:24.920
Who kills women to make a suit out of their skin,

54:24.920 --> 54:28.480
because his application for sex reassignment was rejected,

54:28.480 --> 54:31.400
because, according to Hannibal Lecter,

54:31.400 --> 54:33.920
Billy is not a real transsexual.

54:33.920 --> 54:36.960
Hannibal Lecter is a true scum.

54:36.960 --> 54:39.040
There's so much gatekeeping of trans people,

54:39.040 --> 54:40.940
I just want to use this opportunity

54:40.940 --> 54:43.940
to reassure my trans audience that, even if you've only seen

54:43.940 --> 54:47.180
one or two people, you're valid.

54:47.180 --> 54:49.760
I entertained myself.

54:49.760 --> 54:52.320
That's how I continue to struggle onwards.

54:52.320 --> 54:55.240
Billy hates his own identity, you see,

54:55.240 --> 54:57.620
and he thinks that makes him a transsexual,

54:57.620 --> 55:01.840
but his pathology is a thousand times more savage

55:01.840 --> 55:03.180
and more terrifying.

55:03.180 --> 55:07.060
More savage and terrifying than being a transsexual?

55:07.060 --> 55:08.620
Is that even possible?

55:08.620 --> 55:10.340
Okay, it's definitely getting brighter in here,

55:10.340 --> 55:12.440
because the sun is rising.

55:12.440 --> 55:13.060
Silence of the Lambs differs, but it's not the only one.

55:13.060 --> 55:13.720
Silence of the Lambs differs, but it's not the only one.

55:13.720 --> 55:16.660
It differs from it's male-gazy predecessors

55:16.660 --> 55:20.020
in that it kind of feels like a radical feminist movie.

55:20.020 --> 55:23.180
Clarice is a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability,

55:23.180 --> 55:25.700
and every man in this movie is a pig,

55:25.700 --> 55:27.120
except maybe Hannibal Lecter,

55:27.120 --> 55:29.380
the only one who actually respects Clarice,

55:29.380 --> 55:30.580
the only real gentleman,

55:30.580 --> 55:32.920
with his Goldberg variations and his sketches

55:32.920 --> 55:33.740
of the Duomo.

55:33.740 --> 55:35.120
Chilton's a pig,

55:35.120 --> 55:37.080
the entomologist is a swine,

55:37.080 --> 55:38.880
even Crawford's kind of a pig.

55:38.880 --> 55:40.220
The Pigs are Pigs,

55:40.220 --> 55:41.640
Migs is Pigs,

55:41.640 --> 55:42.840
and Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.

55:42.840 --> 55:43.340
And Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.

55:43.340 --> 55:43.680
And Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.

55:43.680 --> 55:43.700
And Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.

55:43.700 --> 55:44.700
The ultimate pig.

55:44.700 --> 55:45.700
Die Uberschwein.

55:45.700 --> 55:46.700
It's in the original Sherman.

55:46.700 --> 55:48.700
The fuck am I talking about?

55:48.700 --> 55:49.700
What?

55:49.700 --> 55:55.480
And he's obsessed with death's head moths, this demonization of the most self-congratulatory

55:55.480 --> 55:57.480
metaphor for gender transformation.

55:57.480 --> 56:01.380
I can't believe I finally emerged as a beautiful butterfly.

56:01.380 --> 56:02.380
Show don't tell, Lily.

56:02.380 --> 56:05.620
Oh my god, I can't wait till trans people have so many rights that it's okay to make

56:05.620 --> 56:06.620
fun of us.

56:06.620 --> 56:07.680
There's a lot to work with.

56:07.680 --> 56:09.720
So Silence of the Lambs is a good movie.

56:09.720 --> 56:14.320
I'm not saying it's inherently wrong to make a movie or write a book about a transgender

56:14.320 --> 56:17.960
serial killer, but there is an issue of representation.

56:17.960 --> 56:22.760
You know, for decades there was close to zero good representation of trans people in movies

56:22.760 --> 56:28.480
or TV, but a whole host of cross-dressing serial killers, and that has an effect on

56:28.480 --> 56:29.480
the way people think.

56:29.480 --> 56:34.360
When it comes time to debate bathroom bills, and people are subconsciously remembering

56:34.360 --> 56:38.480
psycho, that has serious consequences for trans people.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.480
It's getting so bright in here.

56:39.480 --> 56:41.520
The sun has, like, the sun has risen.

56:41.520 --> 56:47.880
And it's also not psychologically good for us to grow up only seeing monstrous caricatures

56:47.880 --> 56:49.340
of ourselves in media.

56:49.340 --> 56:54.400
Like even as late as my early 20s, I didn't know any trans people, but I'd seen these

56:54.400 --> 56:56.100
transgender horror movies.

56:56.100 --> 57:01.400
I think the most positive approximation of representation I knew about was, like, Frankenfurter

57:01.400 --> 57:02.400
and Divine.

57:02.400 --> 57:08.080
And both of them are also psychotic murderers, just, you know, in a fun way.

57:08.080 --> 57:09.080
Should've just gotten her those chocolates.

57:09.080 --> 57:10.460
Or those cha-cha heels.

57:10.460 --> 57:16.260
So I knew back then I was some kind of a trans, but I guess I felt that it was basically the

57:16.260 --> 57:18.920
moral equivalent of being a serial killer.

57:18.920 --> 57:21.680
Not something you tell other people about, that's for sure.

57:21.680 --> 57:23.460
And things have changed in the last 10 years.

57:23.460 --> 57:26.900
I mean, it's a different world for trans people than it was.

57:26.900 --> 57:31.120
There's trans people now who are 10 years younger than me who don't even hate themselves.

57:31.120 --> 57:32.120
Can't relate.

57:32.120 --> 57:36.120
So this takes us back to 2020 and troubled blood.

57:36.120 --> 57:37.120
Joanne has written a book about a serial killer who is a serial killer.

57:37.120 --> 57:38.120
And she's a serial killer.

57:38.120 --> 57:41.900
A serial killer who dresses as a woman to kill women.

57:41.900 --> 57:42.900
Groundbreaking.

57:42.900 --> 57:48.160
Now this is such a cliche that you'd kind of expect a seasoned writer like J.K. Rowling

57:48.160 --> 57:50.020
to subvert it somehow.

57:50.020 --> 57:51.020
Give us a remix.

57:51.020 --> 57:52.460
Turn it on its head.

57:52.460 --> 57:55.160
Humanize the monster in an unexpected way.

57:55.160 --> 57:57.660
You know, give her a little Half-Blood Prince moment.

57:57.660 --> 57:59.740
Or at least do something new with it.

57:59.740 --> 58:01.080
But she really doesn't.

58:01.080 --> 58:03.440
It's just Buffalo Bill all over again.

58:03.440 --> 58:05.360
I guess I should read you some passages.

58:05.360 --> 58:06.360
I'm reading it on my phone.

58:06.360 --> 58:07.500
I'm not bringing the book out and...

58:07.500 --> 58:09.760
Pretending to read on the book.

58:09.760 --> 58:13.880
You can see from my little bookmarks that I read the physical book.

58:13.880 --> 58:14.880
Yes, I'm a YouTuber.

58:14.880 --> 58:15.880
And yes, I read a book.

58:15.880 --> 58:16.880
So here's the psychiatrist.

58:16.880 --> 58:17.880
There's always a psychiatrist, isn't there?

58:17.880 --> 58:18.880
Here's the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Dennis Creed.

58:18.880 --> 58:19.880
He's a classic sociopath, you see.

58:19.880 --> 58:20.880
A pure example of the type.

58:20.880 --> 58:21.880
He scores very highly on the dark triad.

58:21.880 --> 58:22.880
Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.

58:22.880 --> 58:23.880
Devious, sadistic, unrepentant, and extremely egotistical.

58:23.880 --> 58:24.880
He's a man of his word.

58:24.880 --> 58:25.880
He's a man of his word.

58:25.880 --> 58:26.880
He's a man of his word.

58:26.880 --> 58:27.880
He's a man of his word.

58:27.880 --> 58:28.880
He's a man of his word.

58:28.880 --> 58:29.880
He's a man of his word.

58:29.880 --> 58:30.880
He's a man of his word.

58:30.880 --> 58:40.940
You see, he's what we in the medical profession call the baddie.

58:40.940 --> 58:47.080
Clint Curtis says, quote, it excited me to watch a woman who didn't know ones was being

58:47.080 --> 58:48.080
observed.

58:48.080 --> 58:49.080
I'd do it to my sisters.

58:49.080 --> 58:50.560
But I'd creep up to lit windows as well.

58:50.560 --> 58:55.640
If I got lucky, I'd see women or girls undressing, adjusting themselves, or even a glimpse of

58:55.640 --> 58:56.640
nudity.

58:56.640 --> 59:00.400
I was aroused not only by the obviously sensual aspects, but by the sense of power.

59:00.400 --> 59:00.520
In the book, I opening my eyes to my what I like to consider as true innocence.

59:00.520 --> 59:00.600
So I'm opening my eyes.

59:00.600 --> 59:00.640
So I'm opening my eyes.

59:00.640 --> 59:00.720
So I'm opening my eyes.

59:00.720 --> 59:00.820
getting older, wobbly, apparent To sleep down,".

59:00.820 --> 59:00.840
And without having b slash boops, depression, maybe the late mid days.

59:00.840 --> 59:00.880
Maybe in bed, just it gets annoying.

59:00.880 --> 59:05.520
I stole something of their essence from them, taking that which they had thought private and

59:05.520 --> 59:10.340
hidden. He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear from neighbors' washing lines and even

59:10.340 --> 59:17.600
from his grandmother, Ina. These he enjoyed wearing in secret and masturbating in. Remember when she

59:17.600 --> 59:23.260
wrote books about wizard school? Ho ho, dear readers. So Dennis Creed is characterized as a

59:23.260 --> 59:29.440
narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women. And like, okay, there really are men who fetishize

59:29.440 --> 59:34.880
women's clothes, for example. I mean, Freud talked about this, right? Partialism, where sexuality

59:34.880 --> 59:43.360
focuses on a body part or an article of clothing. And Freud theorized that fetishes emerge from the

59:43.360 --> 59:50.840
unconscious trauma that occurs when men discover that women don't have a penis.

59:53.460 --> 59:59.040
Boy, have I got news for Dr. Freud. But considering that Joanne has been doing a lot of gender

59:59.040 --> 59:59.420
critical research, she's been doing a lot of research on the fact that women don't have a penis.

59:59.420 --> 01:00:06.560
Reading over the past few years, it's kind of hard for me to ignore that narcissistic male

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:13.000
fetishist who preys on women is exactly the way a lot of TERFs characterize trans women. Remember,

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:21.060
the whole gender critical feminists with concerns about trans youth routine is obfuscation. These

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:27.660
people are bigots. And it's a pretty common canard among TERFs that trans women are hypersexual

01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:29.400
and hyperaggressive.

01:00:29.420 --> 01:00:36.400
Right? These inherently pornographic sex demons. But can't we just have a reasonable debate about

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:43.800
this? Are trans women sex demons? Why, yes. Yes, we are. The bigots are simply correct.

01:00:43.800 --> 01:00:50.080
We're sex demons. You can't even talk to these people. Like, how do you engage with this level

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.880
of vilification? I used to take the bait and argue that, no, actually, I'm not a sex demon.

01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:59.160
Unless you want me to be. But it's counterproductive to make that argument.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:05.360
Why? Because my not-involved-in-human-trafficking t-shirt has people asking a lot of questions

01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:10.480
already answered by my shirt. So I have a hard time believing that the character Dennis Creed

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:16.340
has nothing to do with Joanne's beliefs about trans people. And I also want to note that

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:22.180
Dennis' cross-dressing is described not just as part of the sexual satisfaction he gains from

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:28.100
invading women's privacy and invading women's bodies, but also as a deliberate strategy of

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:28.700
deception.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:33.940
This says, on page 854, so you know I actually read this fucking shit.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:40.160
In a wig, bit of lipstick. They think you're harmless. Odd. Maybe queer. You're the nice man

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:40.760
who's safe.

01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.600
And earlier he's described as

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.180
Dennis Creed had been a meticulous planner, a genius of misdirection in his neat little white

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:54.020
van. Dressed in the pink coat he had stolen from Vi Cooper and sometimes wearing a wig that,

01:01:54.020 --> 01:01:58.940
from a distance to a drunk victim, gave his hazy form a feminine appearance,

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.800
so that it would be an expression that made him look like a man.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:03.920
But his head was long enough for his large hands to close over a gasping mouth.

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:09.720
So this character, sprung from Joanne's imagination, cross-dresses as a way to disarm his victims.

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:16.300
They mistake him for a woman. Or as, you know. And that causes them to lower their guard.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:21.620
And this reminds me of one of Maya Forstadter's allegedly transphobic tweets.

01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.340
Pronouns are a hypno. Important article by Hairy Leg Tarpy.

01:02:25.340 --> 01:02:27.940
A.K.A. Wolfamort.

01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:28.120
She who must not be a woman. But who is. She who must not be a man. She who must not be a woman.

01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:28.320
I am the woman. I am the woman. I am the woman. I am the woman.

01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:28.400
I am the woman. I am the woman. I am the woman. I am the woman.

01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.040
She who must not be named.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.740
Followed by J.K. Rowling.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:32.900
Because of course.

01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.480
Pronouns are Rohypnol.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.740
Rohypnol is Roofies.

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.520
And there's a picture of a pill with she on it.

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:40.480
Pronouns are like Rohypnol.

01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:41.820
They dull your defenses.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.740
They change your inhibitions.

01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.640
They're meant to.

01:02:44.880 --> 01:02:49.860
You've had a lifetime's experience learning to be alert to him and to relax to her.

01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:50.800
For good reason.

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.620
These instinctive responses keep you safe.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:55.420
It's not even a conscious thing.

01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:57.860
It's like the hairs standing on end.

01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:02.420
Your subconscious brain is helping you not get eaten by the saber-toothed tiger that

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:03.880
your eyes haven't noticed yet.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:05.180
I want to be alert.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.780
I want others to be alert.

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:11.740
I want people to see the real picture and I want those instinctive reactions that we

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:17.340
feel when something is wrong to be unblunted, undulled by this cheap but effective psychological

01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:17.860
trick.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.880
I feel like I owe this to myself.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:22.580
And I absolutely owe it to other women.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.560
And more than anything, I owe this to girls.

01:03:25.560 --> 01:03:27.820
I don't want to play even the tiniest.

01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.620
I don't want to play even the tiniest part in grooming them to disregard their natural

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:33.620
protective instincts.

01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:35.620
Those instincts are there for a reason.

01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.620
To keep them safe.

01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:40.620
They need those instincts intact and sharp.

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:44.620
And that's why I won't use preferred pronouns.

01:03:44.620 --> 01:03:48.620
Using Rohypnol on others isn't a courtesy.

01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:49.620
Okay.

01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:54.860
So, these are the thoughts of someone who's been hurt.

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:55.860
Speaking of which.

01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:56.860
Let's return now.

01:03:56.860 --> 01:04:02.620
The reason that JK Rowling feels her interest in trans people is intensely personal.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:28.860
I was born this way.

01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:29.860
Born as a fucking idiot.

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:30.860
I made a gin martini because I'm 200 years old.

01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.860
It's kind of an Agatha drink.

01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.860
Well, I'm a 200 year old witch.

01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.860
That's the plot.

01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:34.860
Pay attention.

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:35.860
It makes sense.

01:04:35.860 --> 01:04:36.860
Also, a martini.

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:37.860
What is a martini?

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:38.860
It's an excuse to drink a glass of gin.

01:04:38.860 --> 01:04:39.860
I should probably, um, probably eat an olive.

01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:40.860
Or this is going to go straight to my fucking, my brain.

01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.860
Okay, we have to be serious now.

01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:42.860
In Turf Wars, Joanne writes,

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:43.860
I've been in the public eye for a long time.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:44.860
I've been in the public eye for a long time.

01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:45.860
I've been in the public eye for a long time.

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:46.860
I've been in the public eye for a long time.

01:04:46.860 --> 01:04:47.860
I've been in the public eye for a long time.

01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.300
I've been in the public eye now for over 20 years, and I have never talked publicly

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:03.500
about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:07.780
On Saturday morning, I read that the Scottish government is proceeding with its controversial

01:05:07.780 --> 01:05:13.360
gender recognition plans, which will, in effect, mean that all a man needs to do to become

01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.600
a woman is to say he's one.

01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:21.660
To use a very contemporary word, I was triggered, ground down by the relentless attacks from

01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:24.080
trans activists on social media.

01:05:24.080 --> 01:05:26.820
I spent much of Saturday in a very dark place.

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:32.100
Inside my head as memories of a serious sexual assault I suffered in my twenties recurred

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.100
on a loop.

01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:36.920
I couldn't shut out those memories, and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:41.480
disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with

01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:43.940
women's and girls' safety.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:51.040
Okay, so for Joanne, her traumatic experience being attacked by a man is psychologically

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:56.320
related to her concerns about the legal recognition of trans people.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:06:00.300
And about trans people saying nasty things about her on Twitter.

01:06:00.300 --> 01:06:05.840
She feels intensely about this issue, because the discourse around it literally triggers

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:06.840
her PTSD.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.420
In her own words,

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:13.220
The scars left by violence and sexual assault don't disappear, no matter how loved you are

01:06:13.220 --> 01:06:15.640
and no matter how much money you've made.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:20.500
My perennial jumpiness is a family joke, and even I know it's funny, but I pray my daughters

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:25.600
never have the same reasons I do for hating sudden loud noises or finding people behind me when I'm in trouble.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:34.380
A common symptom of trauma is hypervigilance, a constant alertness to danger.

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:40.440
This is described in a very wise book called Conflict Is Not Abuse by Sarah Shulman.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:45.380
The traumatized person's sense of their ability to protect themselves has been damaged

01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:46.560
or destroyed.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:52.180
They feel endangered even if there is no actual danger in the present, because in the past

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:56.300
they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty and they know it is possible.

01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:02.320
I want to respect that having a trauma trigger response is a real experience of suffering

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:08.560
that is not the victim's fault, even in cases where that response is irrational or politically

01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.560
incorrect.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:16.100
For example, if you got mugged by a black teenager, I wouldn't judge you if you felt

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.560
a little jumpy around black teenagers for a while.

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:25.140
However, if that jumpiness motivates you to become a campaigner for more militant policing

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.320
of black neighborhoods,

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:32.600
then you are participating in anti-black racism, and that I will criticize, regardless of

01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:33.600
your trauma.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:38.420
I hope it goes without saying that trans people gaining easier access to legal recognition

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:45.280
in Scotland in 2020 is completely unrelated to Joanne Rowling being assaulted by a cis

01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:48.060
man in the 1990s.

01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:49.480
This is a non sequitur.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:54.660
So it's a little odd to me that, while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize that her

01:07:54.660 --> 01:07:55.720
hypervigilance is the result of a trauma trigger response, it's also a little odd to me that,

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.220
while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize that her hypervigilance is the result of a

01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:57.680
trauma trigger response, it's also a little odd to me that,

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:02.160
and she's self-aware enough to realize that her hypervigilance is often irrational to

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:05.020
the point where she herself finds humor in it,

01:08:05.020 --> 01:08:11.960
she's somehow not self-aware enough to realize that her fears about trans people are an irrational

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:15.080
manifestation of that hypervigilance.

01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:19.720
And again, it's not that I'm unsympathetic to her trauma, and I would be nothing but

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.620
sympathetic if her feelings about this amounted to simply being triggered by, for example,

01:08:24.620 --> 01:08:25.540
perceiving

01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:31.140
male in the women's bathroom. Which is something most trans women are sensitive to. Like I've spoken

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:36.100
to trans women who are worried they don't pass or who know they don't pass and who do everything

01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:41.220
they can to avoid using a public bathroom because they don't want to make cis women uncomfortable.

01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:46.740
So these trans women go through life every day compromising their own comfort and safety

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:53.700
to protect cis women's feelings of comfort and safety. But Joanne's transphobia has so outgrown

01:08:53.700 --> 01:09:00.740
the scope of an automatic trigger response, it's become a fixation for years. To the point where

01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:06.660
she's written a 900 page novel about a serial killer who cross-dresses to trick women into

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:13.540
being less vigilant. And now the primary political cause she's decided to use her superstardom to

01:09:13.540 --> 01:09:20.500
champion is opposition to trans liberation. And past trauma is just not an excuse for that.

01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.380
Like if you're against gay marriage because you were

01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:23.620
traumatized by a trans woman, you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized by a trans woman.

01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:23.680
Like if you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized by a trans woman, you're against

01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.160
gay marriage because you were traumatized by a trans woman, you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:29.840
as a child when your father left your mother for a man, you're still a homophobe, right? You're not

01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:35.280
less of a bigot because your bigotry has a tragic backstory. In fact, bigotry often has a tragic

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:41.200
backstory. Bigotry involves feelings of being threatened or attacked, so it's often rooted in

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:47.120
trauma. After the collective trauma of 9-11, Americans felt threatened not just by Al-Qaeda

01:09:47.120 --> 01:09:53.600
but by the entire religion of Islam. And this was used and is still being used to justify wars, to

01:09:53.600 --> 01:10:00.720
discrimination, travel bans, hate crimes. Feelings of victimization are often used as a justification

01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:04.320
for aggression. And when the target of that aggression is a marginalized group,

01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:10.240
the result is bigotry. Now what TERFs say is that it's actually the trans activists

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.840
who are the real aggressors, who are the real bigots. Trans women are men, they're agents of the

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:23.520
patriarchy, creepy perverts demanding access to female spaces. TERF is a misogynistic slur designed to

01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:31.200
silence women. It's biological women who are the real victims. The real victim. So often in debates

01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:37.520
on social issues, we're faced with two opposing sides, both claiming to be the victim, and we're

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:44.560
often told to believe victims, believe marginalized people. Well, if only it was that easy. So often the

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:51.440
exact point in question is who is the victim and who's the oppressor. That book I quoted earlier,

01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:52.800
Conflict Is Not Abuse,

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.500
describes the way the overstatement of harm

01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:58.080
is used as a justification for cruelty

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:00.880
in situations ranging from romantic relationships

01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:02.520
to international affairs.

01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:04.860
Bullies often conceptualize themselves

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:06.480
as being under attack

01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:08.780
when they are the ones originating the pain.

01:11:08.780 --> 01:11:10.040
Throughout Joanne's essay,

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.280
she frequently represents herself

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:16.240
as taking a defiant, free-speechy stand against

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:19.500
accusations and threats from trans activists.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:21.280
The trans activists who declare

01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.740
that TERFs need punching and re-educating.

01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.020
Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified

01:11:27.020 --> 01:11:28.780
by the trans activists.

01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:30.680
And in her subsequent tweets,

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:34.980
she frames herself as the victim of a witch hunt.

01:11:34.980 --> 01:11:37.140
Sometimes a T-shirt just speaks to you.

01:11:37.140 --> 01:11:38.820
This witch doesn't burn.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:40.240
This is the new Salem.

01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:42.640
Women are being attacked online

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:45.240
for taking a stand against the transsexuals.

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.680
This witch doesn't burn.

01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:48.240
Let's see what else we have for sale

01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:51.240
at wildwomenworkshop.com.

01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:53.260
Fuck your pronouns.

01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:55.900
Trans men are my sisters.

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:57.760
Sorry about your dick, bro.

01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:58.680
That's a good one.

01:11:58.680 --> 01:11:59.520
I'd wear that.

01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.920
Don't call me sis.

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:04.460
Sis is a vile slur against my tender normality.

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:05.620
Must be really hard for you.

01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:06.880
Not being a .

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:08.380
War is peace.

01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:10.220
Freedom is slavery.

01:12:10.220 --> 01:12:12.320
Ignorance is strength.

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.600
Trans women are women.

01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.600
Got the sense of persecution.

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.180
This is Orwell's nightmare?

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.260
This is how Nazi Germany started?

01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:21.100
First, Hitler told us

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:22.320
he told the transgenders

01:12:22.320 --> 01:12:24.700
they were super-hecking valid uwu.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.200
Then he burned their books out.

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:27.040
Wait.

01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:28.520
Oh, no.

01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:31.300
That's actually the opposite of what happened.

01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:32.460
Slurs.

01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.280
Feminist T-shirt.

01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:35.300
Nice trilby.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.240
It's very dapper.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:37.360
Slurs.

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:38.620
Man-hater.

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.600
Feminazi.

01:12:39.600 --> 01:12:40.420
Prude.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:41.260
Witch.

01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:42.100
Bigot.

01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.100
Wait, bigot?

01:12:43.100 --> 01:12:45.240
Are we reclaiming bigot now?

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:50.240
Is bigot a slur used to silence the females?

01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:52.260
Anne wrote in her essay

01:12:52.260 --> 01:12:54.920
that she was standing up in solidarity with

01:12:54.920 --> 01:12:56.920
women who have histories like mine

01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:58.500
who've been slurred as bigots

01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:01.480
for having concerns around single-sex spaces.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.340
Slurred as bigots.

01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.260
There's something so revealing about the claim

01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:08.220
that bigot is a slur

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:10.400
because so much of indirect bigotry

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:14.420
is an attempt to reverse the roles of victim and aggressor.

01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:18.900
Isn't calling people bigots the real bigotry?

01:13:18.900 --> 01:13:19.740
It's good.

01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.580
It's very clever.

01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.640
A white racist will hardly ever use

01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:24.540
the phrase white supremacy.

01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:27.780
No, they say white genocide.

01:13:27.780 --> 01:13:29.540
Always on the defensive.

01:13:29.540 --> 01:13:34.260
And now transphobes are bemoaning lesbian extinction.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:36.500
The same conservative media,

01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:38.820
who 10 years ago were portraying lesbians

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:41.920
as like angry, mannish ,

01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:44.900
have now created this mythology of lesbians

01:13:44.900 --> 01:13:48.620
as these virginal damsels in distress

01:13:48.620 --> 01:13:50.440
who are threatened with invasion,

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:52.920
and now extinction.

01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.840
On one front, by the dark cabal of endocrinologists

01:13:56.840 --> 01:13:59.580
who are somehow coercing them into becoming men.

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:00.800
Elliot, no.

01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:02.260
You can't possibly be doing this

01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.460
because you're 33 years old

01:14:03.460 --> 01:14:05.260
and capable of autonomous thought.

01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.760
Clearly, you are tricked

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:09.740
by the transgender lesbian extinction agenda.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:13.540
And on the other front, by trans women who, we're told,

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.980
are slurring as bigots.

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:18.040
Lesbians who won't sleep with them.

01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:18.500
Joanne claims that none of the gender-critical women,

01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:19.600
Joanne claims that none of the gender-critical women,

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:20.300
Joanne claims that none of the gender-critical women,

01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.660
I've talked to, hates trans people.

01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:23.780
On the contrary,

01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:27.020
many of them become interested in this issue in the first place

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:28.940
out of concern for trans youth.

01:14:28.940 --> 01:14:32.300
And they're hugely sympathetic towards trans adults

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:34.380
who simply want to live their lives.

01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:38.020
But the only gender-critical women she mentions by name

01:14:38.020 --> 01:14:39.820
are Maya Forstadter,

01:14:39.820 --> 01:14:44.860
who I would not describe as hugely sympathetic to trans adults,

01:14:44.860 --> 01:14:47.220
and Magdalene Burns,

01:14:47.220 --> 01:14:48.880
about whom Joanne says,

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.220
Magdalene was an immense,

01:14:50.220 --> 01:14:52.460
immensely brave young feminist and lesbian.

01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:56.460
Magdalene was a great believer in the importance of biological sex,

01:14:56.460 --> 01:14:59.060
and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots

01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:01.900
for not dating trans women with penises.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:04.260
Okay, so I agree,

01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:06.620
it would be awful to call someone a bigot

01:15:06.620 --> 01:15:10.100
just because they don't want to date a woman with a penis.

01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:14.420
But are you sure that's why people call Magdalene Burns a bigot?

01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:17.940
Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.620
that might lead people to think she's less than a bigot?

01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.220
Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than a bigot?

01:15:20.220 --> 01:15:22.460
Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than a bigot?

01:15:22.460 --> 01:15:22.780
Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than a bigot?

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:26.180
You are fucking blackface actors.

01:15:26.180 --> 01:15:27.420
You aren't women.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:32.140
You're men who get sexual kicks from being treated like women.

01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:35.860
Fuck you and your dirty fucking perversions.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:38.060
Our oppression isn't a fetish,

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:40.460
you pathetic, sick fuck.

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:42.260
Hugely sympathetic.

01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.260
Hugely sympathetic.

01:15:44.260 --> 01:15:49.460
Because Joanne claims that TERFs are hugely sympathetic to trans people,

01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:52.020
and just don't want to be called bigots,

01:15:52.020 --> 01:16:00.100
and because she constantly frames herself as the victim of terrifying trans activists who say mean things online,

01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:05.060
I think it's fair for me to mention that this, right here,

01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:10.460
is how I'm used to being spoken to and spoken about by TERFs.

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:15.100
When you're a trans woman online, TERFs pin you to the vivisection table.

01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:16.820
They deadname and misgender you.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.340
They mock your genitals.

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:18.860
They describe your gender.

01:16:18.860 --> 01:16:22.820
They describe your surgery results as necrotic mutilated wounds.

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:29.180
They interpret your every feeling and experience as the manifestation of a sick, woman-hating fetish.

01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.860
You know, in an unrelated video last year,

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:35.860
I mentioned being sexually assaulted by a man,

01:16:35.860 --> 01:16:39.180
and I've since been told by TERFs,

01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:40.180
essentially,

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:45.060
trans-identified males get sexual kicks from being treated like women.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:48.460
Nathan probably enjoyed his so-called rape.

01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:55.180
I don't even want to say that the mental,"bigmuch, huge, feels so romantic."

01:16:55.180 --> 01:17:02.420
I hope I don't even need to say that the idea that trans women can't be raped because we'll

01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:07.700
just enjoy it is a violently anti-feminist thought.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:16.820
It's a thought that could only be believed no less by people who have spent days and weeks absorbing the dehumanizing propaganda

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:18.660
that TERF forums exist to promote.

01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:21.420
who is in the room with me right now, she'd say,

01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:23.780
I'm so sorry you've been treated that way,

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:27.120
but I too have been cruelly victimized online

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.000
by the trans activists.

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:30.080
And you know what?

01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:32.420
I'm sure that's true.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:35.560
When I listen to Joanne talk about being victimized

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:39.020
by trans Twitter, it's easy for me to sympathize

01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:41.680
because trans Twitter has treated me the same way.

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:45.820
The vilification, the obsession, the fantasies of violence.

01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:47.620
It's a pretty common occurrence for me

01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:49.820
to look at my mentions and see people

01:17:49.820 --> 01:17:53.120
with trans flag avatars posting things like.

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:54.920
Point of view, you are true scum

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.620
and Yoshi is gonna beat you to death with a golf club.

01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.580
Hashtag yes all gamers.

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:02.920
Here's a thread where first they call me an anti-Semite

01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:04.460
because three years ago I made a joke

01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:06.140
about reptilian overlords.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.260
And then they get mad because I said

01:18:08.260 --> 01:18:10.300
I wanted to understand non-binary people

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.680
instead of just dogmatically believing things.

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.940
And they conclude.

01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:15.800
So basically, fuck controversy.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:18.300
For points, I want to bash her over the goddamn head

01:18:18.300 --> 01:18:21.020
with a metal bat over and over again.

01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.220
So this is the level of antipathy

01:18:24.220 --> 01:18:26.480
that I attract from trans Twitter.

01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:28.720
So when Joanne says she's been overwhelmed

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:32.280
by abusive messages, I'm inclined to believe her.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.320
I'm sure her mentions are overwhelmed

01:18:34.320 --> 01:18:36.980
with anime avatars saying things like.

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:38.660
J.K. Rowling is hypocritical trash

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:41.120
who literally walks millions of trans kids dead.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.700
Harry Potter was always neoliberal garbage

01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.320
and we should have seen this coming.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.540
This dumb bitch doesn't deserve our empathy.

01:18:47.540 --> 01:18:50.240
She deserves a backhand slap to the face.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:53.020
And tweets like that are abusive.

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.360
It's not okay.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:56.380
And I don't make any excuses for it.

01:18:56.380 --> 01:18:57.940
I want to make it dark and stormy.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:59.200
Sorry, I'll be right back.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:00.880
Hi, I'm back.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:04.080
It's good.

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:06.120
So I also think that there really is

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.480
an element of misogyny to them.

01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.320
I had to put the drink down.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.380
It's making me laugh.

01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:14.840
You can't, you cannot talk about misogynistic

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.820
cyberbullying while holding a tropical drink.

01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:20.020
It's just not possible to do with a straight face.

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:23.200
So I agree there really is an element of misogyny to this.

01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:25.740
Misogyny is the most universal prejudice

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:27.840
and trans people are not immune.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:30.820
Angry Twitter mobs are generally more vicious to women

01:19:30.820 --> 01:19:33.320
regardless of whether their anger is justified.

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:35.160
There is a witch hunt impulse

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:37.160
that's still alive in our culture.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.880
To be a famous woman is to constantly have every part

01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:44.660
of your body and soul subject to endless critique.

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.460
If you're one pound overweight, they call you a fatty.

01:19:47.460 --> 01:19:48.960
If you're one pound underweight,

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:50.880
they say you have an eating disorder.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.920
And if you're exactly the right weight,

01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:56.720
they call you a fatty with an eating disorder.

01:19:56.720 --> 01:19:59.640
You know, it's a kind of crowdsourced abuse.

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.040
There's a reason Taylor Swift is obsessed with her haters.

01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.420
When you're a famous woman,

01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:06.500
it's hard not to be obsessed with your haters

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:09.720
because the haters bring the obsession to you.

01:20:09.720 --> 01:20:13.000
But it's important to remember that haters

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.820
are not the same as bigots.

01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:19.780
Being mean or rude or even abusive is not bigotry

01:20:19.780 --> 01:20:22.740
unless it's tied to a history of oppression

01:20:22.740 --> 01:20:25.660
or a backlash against a movement of equality.

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:29.440
So no, Mike Huckabee, homophobic is not a slur.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.980
And no, David Silverman,

01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:33.780
the word racist is not like the N-word.

01:20:33.780 --> 01:20:37.220
And no, Joanne Rowling, bigot is not a slur.

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:38.920
Turf is not a slur.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.360
And being canceled on Twitter may be a form of abuse,

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:44.700
but it's not a form of oppression.

01:20:44.700 --> 01:20:47.620
And I say this as someone, at this point,

01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:50.560
most known for complaining about cancel culture.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:52.220
Oh God, is this my legacy?

01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:54.560
A lot of trans people have been very mean,

01:20:54.560 --> 01:20:57.260
verbally abusive even, to JK Rowling.

01:20:57.260 --> 01:20:59.500
But most people criticizing Joanne,

01:20:59.500 --> 01:21:01.960
or criticizing me for that matter,

01:21:01.960 --> 01:21:05.340
might be hurt and angry, but they're not violent.

01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:09.120
But when you're receiving hundreds or thousands of messages

01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:12.000
full of hurt and anger and hate,

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:14.280
you experience it as one huge,

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:18.580
tidal wave of loathing crashing over you all at once.

01:21:18.580 --> 01:21:22.860
And that 0.1% of messages that really are violent,

01:21:22.860 --> 01:21:25.640
they become emblematic of the way

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.560
the whole experience feels.

01:21:28.560 --> 01:21:31.580
And if you've been the victim of abuse before,

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.160
the experience can be pretty triggering.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:37.760
So it's just not always as simple as the victim

01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.360
and the abuser.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:42.080
Sometimes victims are also abusers.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.200
Sometimes abusers have a history

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.520
of victimization.

01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:49.440
Sometimes righteously angry people cross a line

01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:51.260
into abusive excess.

01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.640
And not all abuse comes from a position of power.

01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.720
Why are so many trans people on Twitter

01:21:56.720 --> 01:22:00.800
so easily driven to extremes of rage and aggression?

01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:03.860
Well, there's a passage in Conflict is Not Abuse

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.700
that I think applies just as well to trans Twitter

01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:08.520
as it does to TERFs.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.600
People living in unrecovered trauma

01:22:10.600 --> 01:22:12.580
often behave in very similar ways

01:22:12.580 --> 01:22:14.180
to the people who traumatize them.

01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:16.640
Over and over, I have seen traumatized people

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:19.400
refuse to hear or engage information

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.260
that would alter their self-concepts,

01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:22.680
even in ways that could bring them

01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:24.540
more happiness and integrity.

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:27.160
The undiscovered traumatized person's refusal

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:29.740
is rooted in a panic that their fragile self

01:22:29.740 --> 01:22:31.480
cannot bear interrogation,

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:34.380
that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible.

01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:36.220
Perhaps because supremacy in some

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.080
produces trauma in others,

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:39.900
they can become mirror images.

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.880
And of course, many perpetrators

01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.080
were or are victims themselves.

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:47.860
A lot of TERFs have been treated very horribly by men,

01:22:47.860 --> 01:22:51.500
and they misdirect some reflection of that abuse

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:53.820
at trans people, a vulnerable group

01:22:53.820 --> 01:22:56.280
who they can mostly get away with hurting.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.500
Unlike standing up to powerful men, right?

01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:01.100
Which would be dangerous and difficult.

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:04.240
And a lot of trans people have been very horribly treated

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:07.840
by men, by TERFs, by strangers on the street,

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.480
by their own families.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.480
And for some of those trans people,

01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:11.640
canceling celebrities on Twitter is the worst thing.

01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.680
canceling celebrities on Twitter is the worst thing.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:13.820
canceling celebrities on Twitter is the worst thing.

01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:13.860
canceling celebrities on Twitter is the worst thing.

01:23:13.860 --> 01:23:16.360
is the one kind of power they have.

01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:19.860
Plus, a lot of extremely online trans people

01:23:19.860 --> 01:23:22.820
really don't have a strong sense of conviction

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:24.080
in their own identity,

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.020
which is why they need constant external validation

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.300
to prop them up.

01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:31.540
They need to constantly be told that they're valid,

01:23:31.540 --> 01:23:34.060
that they really are the gender that they say they are.

01:23:34.060 --> 01:23:37.860
And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions

01:23:37.860 --> 01:23:41.560
their fragile self-concept, they lash out,

01:23:41.560 --> 01:23:43.580
Twitter being their only weapon.

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:46.320
You know, Joanne, you say at the end of your essay

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:49.220
that all you're asking, all you want,

01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:51.040
is empathy and understanding.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.860
And I've tried to extend that to you in this video.

01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:57.460
But trans people also deserve more empathy and understanding

01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.520
than you've given them.

01:23:58.520 --> 01:24:01.380
Sometimes you should look at some of these Twitter accounts

01:24:01.380 --> 01:24:03.480
that are always raging against you

01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:06.200
and raging against me, for that matter.

01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:09.680
In between the raging, look at what they're doing.

01:24:09.680 --> 01:24:13.160
They're begging, begging for money to pay for healthcare,

01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:15.360
begging for money to pay for housing.

01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.580
You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Joanne,

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:24.580
or pounds, or Gringotts, or whatever you people have.

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.160
And trans people are out here

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.880
literally begging for healthcare.

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:30.620
They're begging, Joanne.

01:24:30.620 --> 01:24:34.040
How powerful could the trans agenda really be?

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:37.300
Joanne, you have so much power and influence,

01:24:37.300 --> 01:24:40.400
many, many times more than what I have.

01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:42.940
And I have much more power and influence

01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:44.740
than most trans people.

01:24:44.740 --> 01:24:46.920
You know, I am in a very different situation

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.160
than most trans people.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:51.080
I have a lot of other things going for me in this world,

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:53.680
but a lot of them have nothing.

01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:56.180
They have nothing, Joanne.

01:24:56.180 --> 01:25:00.320
And I just think you should take that into consideration

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:02.660
next time you decide to speak out

01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:05.320
about how trans activists are oppressing you.

01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:08.000
Get it together, Gorge.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.260
Are you listening to yourself?

01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.440
What are you doing, Joanne?

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:12.920
You know, a lot of trans people have gone through life,

01:25:12.940 --> 01:25:14.940
being rejected, and humiliated,

01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:17.600
and excluded over and over again.

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:19.100
So they're traumatized.

01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:21.880
They're easily triggered by anything that reminds them

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:24.340
of past betrayal and abandonment,

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:27.460
which is something I think you could empathize with.

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:30.040
Joanne, you are famous for writing a book

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:33.460
about a neglected and abused boy who lives in a closet

01:25:33.460 --> 01:25:36.220
until he's whisked away to a magical world

01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:37.880
where he and his freaky friends

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:39.640
find acceptance in each other.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.900
I remember when I first met you all.

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:42.820
Biggest bunch of-

01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:45.260
Misfits I ever set eyes on.

01:25:45.260 --> 01:25:46.700
We're still a bunch of misfits.

01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:49.420
Well, maybe, but we've all got each other.

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:53.260
So many trans people have found comfort in this story

01:25:53.260 --> 01:25:54.880
and an escape from a world

01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:58.640
that doesn't offer a lot of comfort to trans people.

01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.640
So for you to use your fame and influence

01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:05.960
to rally the backlash against trans acceptance,

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.820
it feels like a betrayal to a lot of people.

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.940
And I don't blame them for feeling that way.

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:12.440
I feel it too.

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:13.400
So Joanne,

01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:15.780
Jo,

01:26:15.780 --> 01:26:17.040
mother,

01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.560
I'm sorry about the Twitter mob.

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:20.480
I know how much that sucks.

01:26:20.480 --> 01:26:23.540
So if you ever want to take me up on it,

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:25.640
I'll buy you a drink to apologize for that.

01:26:25.640 --> 01:26:27.820
But otherwise, I think we're done here.

01:26:27.820 --> 01:26:29.360
As a trans person,

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.140
I like to believe in the power of human metamorphosis,

01:26:32.140 --> 01:26:33.760
but I realized that at this point,

01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:36.700
you're being constantly love bombed by transphobes

01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.900
and constantly trashed by trans people.

01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:42.280
So it would be pretty difficult to change tracks at this point.

01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.660
You'd be one in a million if you pulled that off.

01:26:44.660 --> 01:26:48.300
And I don't know Joanne, maybe you are one in a million.

01:26:48.300 --> 01:26:49.900
I mean, you wrote The Prisoner of Azkaban

01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:51.600
and that shit got me through fifth grade.

01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:52.840
So who knows?

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:54.600
Maybe you have another miracle in you.

01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:56.820
But I'm too old to believe in magic now.

01:26:56.820 --> 01:27:00.540
So I'm not gonna sit around waiting for a letter to Hogwarts.

01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:05.020
Okay, I guess that's it.

01:27:07.480 --> 01:27:08.940
Mischief managed.

01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.940
Menu chef.

01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:16.780
They don't have any special menu in the store.

01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:18.520
I did.

01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:21.280
Who are they?

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.840
I don't know that.

01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:25.480
Well, I guess that's it for this episode.

01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:26.420
See you next times at 15 grand.

01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:27.920
Bye-bye.

01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.740
McKlessar, Gib's not even that интересно.

01:27:29.740 --> 01:27:31.260
He is.

01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:32.880
See you next time!

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:34.180
Bye-bye.

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:35.240
And there you go again,

01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:37.100
poshlyогоorinthisame.com.

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:38.460
Probably not a smartass.

01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:39.880
But your退ence was close enough.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:40.860
But yeah, who am I talking to right now?

01:27:40.860 --> 01:27:41.880
Mischief managed.

01:27:42.280 --> 01:28:12.260
Thank you.

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:42.260
Thank you.

01:28:42.280 --> 01:29:12.260
Thank you.

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:42.260
Thank you.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:44.840
Thank you.
