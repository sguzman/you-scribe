00:00.000 --> 00:24.560
Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital messiah, the online oracle, the social media savior, yea, verily I say unto you, there are influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night.

00:24.560 --> 00:32.220
And lo, I came upon them, and the glory of my posts shone about me, and I delivered unto them a vision.

00:43.060 --> 00:45.820
Freedom, freedom, fucking freedom.

00:46.380 --> 00:52.760
Which matters more, the freedom to live an authentic life, or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel of a jackboot?

00:52.760 --> 00:54.540
As a centrist, I am unbiased.

00:54.560 --> 00:58.080
Undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it.

00:58.400 --> 01:05.560
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss important issues like Mexicans.

01:05.900 --> 01:06.980
How dangerous are they?

01:07.240 --> 01:09.240
Muslims, can we stop them?

01:09.440 --> 01:17.760
Tonight we return, once again, to the dangerous transgender trend that is turning your children into all manner of half-and-halfs and in-betweens.

01:17.760 --> 01:23.780
I mean, look at this, they're transing 13-year-olds now, what's next, babies with breast implants?

01:23.780 --> 01:25.780
It makes me want to throw up.

01:25.780 --> 01:30.580
I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.

01:30.580 --> 01:32.160
Cut the music!

01:32.160 --> 01:37.900
Tonight, my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and conservative opinion-haver.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.900
And my second guest...

01:39.900 --> 01:46.960
Well, what the hell are you? You're transgender, you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's your deal?

01:46.960 --> 01:53.120
Well, Jackie Jackson, my, as you say, deal, is I don't like society.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.120
Forcing me into tiny little boxes.

01:56.120 --> 01:59.120
Okay, but are you a man or a woman? Just tell me.

01:59.120 --> 02:03.120
Well, why does it matter? Why do you have to know?

02:03.120 --> 02:11.120
Maybe you should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these little categories, Jackie Jackson.

02:11.120 --> 02:17.120
Well, can I at least ask your name, or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?

02:17.120 --> 02:19.120
My name is Baltimore.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.620
Baltimore what?

02:20.620 --> 02:22.620
Baltimore, Maryland.

02:23.120 --> 02:26.120
I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore, Maryland?

02:26.120 --> 02:29.120
It is among my names.

02:29.120 --> 02:31.120
Tiffany, what do you make of this?

02:31.120 --> 02:34.120
Look, Jackie, I'm going to be completely real with you.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.120
I am a transsexual.

02:36.120 --> 02:40.120
That means I have a very specific mental disorder called gender dysphoria.

02:40.120 --> 02:44.120
I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance in the womb.

02:44.120 --> 02:52.120
This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function.

02:52.120 --> 02:54.120
It is not a fashion statement.

02:54.120 --> 02:55.120
It is not a trend.

02:55.120 --> 02:57.120
It is not an easy way to feel special and oppressed.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.120
It is a very difficult condition to live with.

03:03.120 --> 03:05.120
I'm dying inside.

03:05.120 --> 03:08.120
Okay, so you're both transsexuals then.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.120
No, I am a transsexual.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.120
That is not a transsexual.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.120
That is a trans-trender.

03:14.120 --> 03:17.120
Trans-trender? What is that? Is that a gender?

03:17.120 --> 03:18.120
No, it's not a gender.

03:18.120 --> 03:21.120
A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here,

03:21.120 --> 03:30.120
who puts on a dress and puts glitter on his beard and goes around telling people he's transgender and complaining about misgendering for oppression points.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.120
Actually, it's they.

03:32.120 --> 03:33.120
What?

03:33.120 --> 03:34.120
I use they-them pronouns.

03:34.120 --> 03:38.120
They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.120
Why do you say that, Tiffany Tumbles?

03:40.120 --> 03:44.120
Have I complained about oppression so far?

03:44.120 --> 03:49.120
It seems to me that it is you who has been complaining about your dysphoria.

03:49.120 --> 03:50.120
Isn't it you?

03:50.120 --> 03:55.120
Is it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?

03:55.120 --> 03:57.120
No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed.

03:57.120 --> 04:01.120
I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.120
It's in my brain.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.120
I was diagnosed.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.120
It's a fact.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.120
It's real.

04:06.120 --> 04:08.120
My pain is real.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.120
And my pain isn't real?

04:10.120 --> 04:13.120
It's interesting that you think that.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.120
Well, what pain are you talking about?

04:15.120 --> 04:18.120
People making fun of you because you dress like a circus act?

04:18.120 --> 04:20.120
Interesting that you mentioned the circus.

04:20.120 --> 04:28.120
Tiffany Tumbles, don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the circus?

04:28.120 --> 04:30.120
You're not confined anywhere.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.120
You choose to dress like that.

04:32.120 --> 04:35.120
And why do you choose to dress the way you dress?

04:35.120 --> 04:38.120
Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman.

04:38.120 --> 04:39.120
Hello.

04:39.120 --> 04:43.120
And I'm non-binary, so I dress non-conforming.

04:43.120 --> 04:48.120
Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?

04:48.120 --> 04:50.120
Well, it's a free country.

04:50.120 --> 04:53.120
If you want to be a glitterbeard genderfuck, then go ahead.

04:53.120 --> 04:59.120
But don't go around telling people that you're transgender because it makes us all look like a bunch of trendy freaks.

04:59.120 --> 05:03.120
But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society?

05:03.120 --> 05:08.120
Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity?

05:08.120 --> 05:12.120
Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.120
That is simply adding another cell to the prison.

05:16.120 --> 05:17.120
It's not about conforming.

05:17.120 --> 05:20.120
It's about me having an actual medical condition.

05:20.120 --> 05:23.120
You do not have a female brain.

05:23.120 --> 05:25.120
You have a fashion disaster.

05:25.120 --> 05:26.120
Oh, do they?

05:26.120 --> 05:29.120
Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles.

05:29.120 --> 05:34.120
When the doctor prescribed your hormones, did he take a look at your brain then?

05:34.120 --> 05:35.120
What?

05:35.120 --> 05:36.120
Of course not.

05:36.120 --> 05:40.120
But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?

05:40.120 --> 05:42.120
Well, no.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.120
Where are you going with this?

05:43.120 --> 05:46.120
I mean, if you've never seen your brain,

05:46.120 --> 05:50.120
and the doctor who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it,

05:50.120 --> 05:53.120
then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

05:53.120 --> 05:58.120
how do you know that you have a female brain?

06:02.120 --> 06:03.120
Bullshit.

06:03.120 --> 06:04.120
That's a good point.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.120
No, it isn't.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.120
Look, there's scientific studies thatâ€”

06:06.120 --> 06:12.120
Can you explain to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain?

06:12.120 --> 06:14.120
Are they different colors?

06:14.120 --> 06:15.120
I'm not an expert.

06:15.120 --> 06:16.120
I'm not an expert.

06:16.120 --> 06:19.120
But there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.120
I see.

06:20.120 --> 06:23.120
But your doctor never looked at your brain.

06:23.120 --> 06:27.120
So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?

06:27.120 --> 06:30.120
Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it.

06:30.120 --> 06:34.120
And you told him what exactly?

06:34.120 --> 06:36.120
That I experience gender dysphoria.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.120
So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,

06:39.120 --> 06:41.120
and therefore your identity,

06:41.120 --> 06:43.120
is valid not because of any observed factors,

06:43.120 --> 06:46.120
not because of any observed facts about your brain,

06:46.120 --> 06:53.120
but because of your feelings?

06:53.120 --> 06:55.120
Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.120
You backed me into a corner.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.120
Sure, it's because of my feelings.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.120
My feelings of gender dysphoria.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.120
So tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

07:04.120 --> 07:09.120
why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid,

07:09.120 --> 07:12.120
but mine, according to you, are not?

07:13.120 --> 07:16.120
This burgeoning brick.

07:16.120 --> 07:18.120
You guys, let's think about this.

07:18.120 --> 07:21.120
If I have never seen my brain,

07:22.120 --> 07:24.120
how do I know I even have a brain?

07:24.120 --> 07:26.120
Well, you probably don't, girl.

07:26.120 --> 07:30.120
Look, Baltimore, I'm sure you have lots of feelings about your gender.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.120
And if you feel cloud gender or demi-nebula or astroglide

07:34.120 --> 07:37.120
or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind,

07:37.120 --> 07:39.120
then you do you, girl.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.120
Or, not girl, whatever the fuck you are.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.120
But I want to make one thing very clear.

07:44.120 --> 07:48.120
I am nothing like you, okay?

07:48.120 --> 07:50.120
My gender is not unicorns and glitter.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.120
My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis

07:53.120 --> 07:55.120
that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.120
No, not even you.

07:57.120 --> 08:01.120
My, I'm really getting under your skin, aren't I?

08:01.120 --> 08:02.120
No.

08:02.120 --> 08:05.120
Well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are.

08:05.120 --> 08:08.120
You're getting under my skin because it really rattles my dysphoria

08:08.120 --> 08:11.120
that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender community,

08:11.120 --> 08:15.120
when in fact, you're just making a mockery of my pain.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.120
Your pain?

08:17.120 --> 08:21.120
You're in a lot of pain, aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles?

08:21.120 --> 08:25.120
Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.

08:25.120 --> 08:28.120
And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.120
I pity you because you don't think you're real

08:31.120 --> 08:35.120
until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad.

08:35.120 --> 08:38.120
And I can't imagine what it must be like

08:38.120 --> 08:40.120
to have so little confidence

08:40.120 --> 08:42.120
in your own reality.

08:42.120 --> 08:44.120
Okay, well, don't patronize me.

08:44.120 --> 08:47.120
I'm just trying to understand, Tiffany Tumbles,

08:47.120 --> 08:51.120
why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself

08:51.120 --> 08:53.120
and hating your body.

08:53.120 --> 08:57.120
Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory?

08:57.120 --> 08:59.120
No, you don't have to hate yourself or hate your body,

08:59.120 --> 09:01.120
but you do have to have dysphoria.

09:01.120 --> 09:04.120
And if you tell people otherwise, you're just misleading them.

09:04.120 --> 09:09.120
I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.120
Would you please join me

09:11.120 --> 09:13.120
in saying a prayer for your wellness?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.120
Actually, I would strongly prefer

09:15.120 --> 09:17.120
if you would stay away from any of my rifts.

09:17.120 --> 09:19.120
Oh, goddess of light,

09:19.120 --> 09:21.120
please shield and protect Tiffany

09:21.120 --> 09:23.120
against the ravages of inner strife.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.120
Enclose her in your loving arms

09:25.120 --> 09:28.120
and cleanse her of all condemnation

09:28.120 --> 09:30.120
and internalized transphobia.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.120
I entreat you, oh great mother,

09:32.120 --> 09:36.120
bathe Tiffany in inner peace, acceptance, and self-care,

09:36.120 --> 09:38.120
and rid her of her toxic,

09:38.120 --> 09:40.120
disnormative, true scum ways.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.120
Amen.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.120
Are we done here?

09:42.120 --> 09:44.120
I don't think I can make it through any more readings

09:44.120 --> 09:45.120
from the SJW prayer book.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.120
Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love

09:47.120 --> 09:49.120
I am trying to deliver unto you?

09:49.120 --> 09:51.120
Because I'm grossed out by you.

09:51.120 --> 09:52.120
That's why.

09:52.120 --> 09:53.120
Okay, then.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.120
Well, namaste, bitch.

09:55.120 --> 09:59.120
Look, why don't we all take a step back

09:59.120 --> 10:03.120
and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform

10:03.120 --> 10:06.120
and let them know how much we appreciate their service.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.120
God, I love the troops.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.120
Thinking about the troops makes me wet.

10:10.120 --> 10:11.120
It makes me cum.

10:11.120 --> 10:13.120
Semper fi, boys.

10:18.120 --> 10:19.120
What?

10:19.120 --> 10:21.120
I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.120
Tiffany, your transsexualism,

10:23.120 --> 10:25.120
I have to say I don't love it,

10:25.120 --> 10:28.120
but you do seem to at least be aware

10:28.120 --> 10:30.120
that you have some kind of mental disorder,

10:30.120 --> 10:31.120
so I'll give you that.

10:31.120 --> 10:34.120
Whereas, Baltimore, you're what?

10:34.120 --> 10:36.120
Making some kind of statement?

10:36.120 --> 10:38.120
If my existence is a statement,

10:38.120 --> 10:40.120
I think that says more about society

10:40.120 --> 10:42.120
than it says about me.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.120
Jackie, what you have to understand

10:43.120 --> 10:46.120
is there have been transsexuals around for a long time.

10:46.120 --> 10:49.120
I have talked to 80-year-old transsexuals,

10:49.120 --> 10:50.120
and they agree with me

10:50.120 --> 10:52.120
that all this genderqueer bullshit,

10:52.120 --> 10:54.120
it's just a trend.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.120
It's a fad.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.120
But is it?

10:56.120 --> 10:57.120
For thousands of years,

10:57.120 --> 10:59.120
there have been third-gender groups

10:59.120 --> 11:00.120
across human cultures.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.120
There's the Hydra of India,

11:02.120 --> 11:05.120
the two-spirit people among Native Americans.

11:05.120 --> 11:07.120
Whereas, binary transsexualism

11:07.120 --> 11:10.120
is a medical construct of the 20th century.

11:10.120 --> 11:14.120
Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition

11:14.120 --> 11:16.120
until 2013,

11:16.120 --> 11:19.120
meaning that Tumblr is twice as old

11:19.120 --> 11:23.120
as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis.

11:23.120 --> 11:26.120
So perhaps it is you, Tiffany Tumbles,

11:26.120 --> 11:30.120
and not I who is following a trend.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.120
Wow, that just blew my mind.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.120
The tables are turned, bitch.

11:37.120 --> 11:39.120
Tiffany, could you explain to me

11:39.120 --> 11:42.120
why you decided to become a trans-trender?

11:46.120 --> 11:48.120
He's not Native American, though.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.120
They.

11:49.120 --> 11:50.120
They.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.120
You know, it's kinda hard not to call you he

11:51.120 --> 11:53.120
when you have a fucking beard.

11:53.120 --> 11:54.120
If you were actually trans

11:54.120 --> 11:55.120
and you actually had dysphoria,

11:55.120 --> 11:57.120
then you wouldn't be comfortable with that.

11:57.120 --> 11:59.120
Your Honor, in my defense,

11:59.120 --> 12:00.120
it is a glitter beard.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.120
Okay.

12:01.120 --> 12:02.120
Well, that's very 2019,

12:02.120 --> 12:04.120
very gender, very they,

12:04.120 --> 12:07.120
but what it isn't is two-spirit.

12:07.120 --> 12:09.120
Look, the SJWs don't even agree with this.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.120
They think it's racist.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.120
White people have two genders.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.120
Pick one and sit down, dude.

12:14.120 --> 12:15.120
Yeah, that's a good point.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.120
Two genders.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.120
Two genders.

12:17.120 --> 12:18.120
Attack helicopter.

12:18.120 --> 12:19.120
It's ma'am.

12:19.120 --> 12:20.120
Okay.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.120
Attack helicopter.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.120
Two genders.

12:22.120 --> 12:23.120
Only two genders.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.120
How many genders?

12:24.120 --> 12:25.120
Two.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.120
Attack helicopter.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.120
It's ma'am.

12:27.120 --> 12:28.120
Two genders.

12:28.120 --> 12:29.120
Two genders.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.120
Two genders.

12:30.120 --> 12:31.120
You're just saying that you're me

12:31.120 --> 12:32.120
and talking in a whiny voice.

12:32.120 --> 12:33.120
That is not an argument.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.120
The toxic truce gumbolias are gatekeeping my gender.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.120
I don't have dysphoria,

12:37.120 --> 12:38.120
but for some reason,

12:38.120 --> 12:39.120
I still have access to doctors

12:39.120 --> 12:40.120
like a transition

12:40.120 --> 12:41.120
from a man to a man.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.120
The one thing you'll always have to deal with in life

12:42.120 --> 12:43.120
is assholes.

12:43.120 --> 12:44.120
Oh, but how dare you misgender me?

12:44.120 --> 12:45.120
It's hard to be yourself,

12:45.120 --> 12:46.120
but it's worth it.

12:46.120 --> 12:47.120
How dare you not know that I use they,

12:47.120 --> 12:48.120
then I don't,

12:48.120 --> 12:49.120
even though no one ever sees that.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.120
Let's be ourselves.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.120
Let's totally be ourselves.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.120
All right.

12:52.120 --> 12:53.120
That's enough of this.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.120
You know,

12:54.120 --> 12:55.120
as a biological female,

12:55.120 --> 12:56.120
I honestly don't understand any of this

12:56.120 --> 12:57.120
shitty shit.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.120
Okay.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.120
That was a hard T.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.120
Now, does my husband sometimes wear panties around the house

13:01.120 --> 13:03.120
and ask me to call him mommy's little slut?

13:03.120 --> 13:04.120
Well, sure,

13:04.120 --> 13:08.120
but that is a matter between her and the Lord.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.120
Let's best not think about it too much.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.120
Anyway, Tiffany,

13:12.120 --> 13:14.120
my brain has an easier time processing you

13:14.120 --> 13:16.120
than whatever is going on over here,

13:16.120 --> 13:18.120
so congratulations.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.120
You're the winner.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.120
That was some excellent free speech.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.120
Okay.

13:22.120 --> 13:23.120
Great.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.120
So, in conclusion,

13:25.120 --> 13:27.120
trans-trenders are real

13:27.120 --> 13:28.120
and probably dangerous.

13:28.120 --> 13:30.120
Make sure to protect your children.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.120
Bye.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.120
As for how many genders there are,

13:33.120 --> 13:34.120
you know,

13:34.120 --> 13:35.120
I'm going to take the centrist route

13:35.120 --> 13:37.120
and say two and a half.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.120
All right.

13:38.120 --> 13:39.120
That's our show.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.120
This has been the Freedom Report

13:40.120 --> 13:43.120
where the debate never stops.

13:43.120 --> 13:45.120
Except when the show is over.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.120
Get out.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.120
The girl can't help it.

13:48.120 --> 13:49.120
She's a Libra.

13:55.120 --> 13:56.120
Behold,

13:56.120 --> 13:57.120
the non-binary lamb

13:57.120 --> 13:59.120
who is despised and rejected.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.120
They gave their cheek

14:00.120 --> 14:02.120
to them that mocked their beard

14:02.120 --> 14:04.120
and hid not their face from shame.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.120
But lo,

14:05.120 --> 14:06.120
Tiffany,

14:06.120 --> 14:07.120
the person who tricks

14:07.120 --> 14:09.120
trendier than thou,

14:09.120 --> 14:10.120
a shady queen,

14:10.120 --> 14:12.120
came next upon her friend Justine

14:12.120 --> 14:15.120
and sought her counsel thus.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.120
God damn it, Justine.

14:33.120 --> 14:34.120
I just can't

14:34.120 --> 14:35.120
with these trenders anymore.

14:35.120 --> 14:37.120
I simply cannot.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.120
You know,

14:38.120 --> 14:39.120
you can just text me here

14:39.120 --> 14:41.120
and I'll come open the door.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.120
Okay.

14:42.120 --> 14:44.120
Seems a little formal.

14:44.120 --> 14:45.120
Ugh.

14:45.120 --> 14:47.120
You look great, hon.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.120
Cute.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.120
Justine,

14:49.120 --> 14:50.120
you look like absolute shit.

14:50.120 --> 14:51.120
What happened?

14:51.120 --> 14:52.120
Did the cat girl

14:52.120 --> 14:53.120
finally beat you up?

14:53.120 --> 14:54.120
No.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.120
I...

14:55.120 --> 14:56.120
Justine, look,

14:56.120 --> 14:57.120
I slept in my makeup, okay?

14:57.120 --> 14:58.120
Leave me alone.

14:58.120 --> 14:59.120
I've been having a difficult time.

14:59.120 --> 15:00.120
Were we serving

15:00.120 --> 15:01.120
a little depression moment?

15:01.120 --> 15:02.120
Jesus.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.120
Well,

15:03.120 --> 15:04.120
don't leave me out.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.120
I saw you

15:05.120 --> 15:06.120
on the Freedom Report today.

15:06.120 --> 15:07.120
Okay, girl,

15:07.120 --> 15:08.120
can we talk about

15:08.120 --> 15:09.120
Ladybeard, Baltimore, Maryland?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.120
Ugh.

15:10.120 --> 15:11.120
Add that one

15:11.120 --> 15:12.120
to the crazy

15:12.120 --> 15:13.120
tranny hall of fame.

15:13.120 --> 15:14.120
Really?

15:14.120 --> 15:15.120
You're happy

15:15.120 --> 15:16.120
with the way that went?

15:16.120 --> 15:17.120
You feel good about that?

15:17.120 --> 15:18.120
You feel good

15:18.120 --> 15:19.120
about yourself right now?

15:19.120 --> 15:20.120
Well,

15:20.120 --> 15:21.120
why wouldn't I?

15:21.120 --> 15:22.120
Tiffany,

15:22.120 --> 15:23.120
there is nothing

15:23.120 --> 15:24.120
more sad

15:24.120 --> 15:25.120
and pathetic

15:25.120 --> 15:26.120
and desperate

15:26.120 --> 15:27.120
and low in this world

15:27.120 --> 15:28.120
than a tran

15:28.120 --> 15:29.120
who thinks

15:29.120 --> 15:30.120
she's better

15:30.120 --> 15:31.120
than other trans.

15:31.120 --> 15:32.120
It's like a drunk

15:32.120 --> 15:33.120
feeling superior

15:33.120 --> 15:34.120
to a junkie.

15:34.120 --> 15:35.120
You seem to think

15:35.120 --> 15:36.120
that you're queen

15:36.120 --> 15:37.120
of the world

15:37.120 --> 15:38.120
because you're hanging on

15:38.120 --> 15:39.120
to societal acceptance

15:39.120 --> 15:40.120
by two fingers

15:40.120 --> 15:41.120
instead of one.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.120
Well,

15:42.120 --> 15:43.120
you're not, bitch.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.120
You're just an insecure,

15:44.120 --> 15:45.120
frightened little queer

15:45.120 --> 15:46.120
who's determined

15:46.120 --> 15:47.120
to use the one ounce

15:47.120 --> 15:48.120
of power you have

15:48.120 --> 15:49.120
to tread

15:49.120 --> 15:50.120
other people down.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.120
And if I'm being honest,

15:51.120 --> 15:52.120
I don't find

15:52.120 --> 15:53.120
that very admirable.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.120
Your eyelash

15:57.120 --> 15:58.120
is coming unglued.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.120
Ugh.

15:59.120 --> 16:02.120
My life is coming unglued.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.120
Ugh.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.120
Look,

16:04.120 --> 16:05.120
it's not like I'm coming

16:05.120 --> 16:06.120
after trannies

16:06.120 --> 16:07.120
who just can't afford

16:07.120 --> 16:08.120
to transition

16:08.120 --> 16:09.120
or don't have

16:09.120 --> 16:10.120
the social support.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.120
It's not like Baltimore

16:11.120 --> 16:12.120
is doing everything

16:12.120 --> 16:13.120
he can to pass

16:13.120 --> 16:14.120
and people just treat him

16:14.120 --> 16:15.120
like a freak

16:15.120 --> 16:16.120
for no reason.

16:16.120 --> 16:17.120
They.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.120
It's they.

16:18.120 --> 16:19.120
Are we really saying

16:19.120 --> 16:20.120
they now?

16:20.120 --> 16:21.120
In private?

16:21.120 --> 16:22.120
Yes,

16:22.120 --> 16:23.120
we are.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.120
So get used to it.

16:24.120 --> 16:25.120
My name is Justine.

16:25.120 --> 16:26.120
I think misgendering

16:26.120 --> 16:27.120
is toxic

16:27.120 --> 16:28.120
because I care

16:28.120 --> 16:29.120
about people's feelings.

16:29.120 --> 16:30.120
Ugh.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.120
I always forget

16:31.120 --> 16:32.120
that you're like

16:32.120 --> 16:33.120
actually an SJW.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.120
I always forget

16:34.120 --> 16:35.120
that you're actually

16:35.120 --> 16:36.120
an asshole.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.120
Why do I even hang out

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
with you?

16:38.120 --> 16:39.120
Oh,

16:39.120 --> 16:40.120
because you hate yourself

16:40.120 --> 16:41.120
and you have to believe

16:41.120 --> 16:42.120
there's hope for me

16:42.120 --> 16:43.120
because if there's hope

16:43.120 --> 16:44.120
for me,

16:44.120 --> 16:45.120
there might be hope

16:45.120 --> 16:46.120
for you.

16:46.120 --> 16:47.120
Wow,

16:47.120 --> 16:48.120
you're developing

16:48.120 --> 16:49.120
self-consciousness.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.120
Where'd you learn

16:50.120 --> 16:51.120
that trick?

16:51.120 --> 16:52.120
Gigi?

16:52.120 --> 16:53.120
Tiffany,

16:53.120 --> 16:54.120
have you ever

16:54.120 --> 16:55.120
been bullied?

16:55.120 --> 16:56.120
Oh,

16:56.120 --> 16:57.120
let's see.

16:57.120 --> 16:58.120
You don't see me

16:58.120 --> 16:59.120
going on talk shows

16:59.120 --> 17:00.120
to play the victim.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.120
No,

17:01.120 --> 17:02.120
I see you going

17:02.120 --> 17:03.120
on talk shows

17:03.120 --> 17:04.120
to play the bully.

17:04.120 --> 17:05.120
I think you grew up

17:05.120 --> 17:06.120
getting bullied

17:06.120 --> 17:07.120
for being a sissy

17:07.120 --> 17:08.120
till you started passing

17:08.120 --> 17:09.120
as a woman

17:09.120 --> 17:10.120
and then you got

17:10.120 --> 17:11.120
a little taste of normal

17:11.120 --> 17:12.120
and now you want

17:12.120 --> 17:13.120
to be the one

17:13.120 --> 17:14.120
who bashes the queers.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.120
Bash them?

17:15.120 --> 17:16.120
If anything,

17:16.120 --> 17:17.120
I'm the one

17:17.120 --> 17:18.120
defending trans people

17:18.120 --> 17:19.120
from appropriation

17:19.120 --> 17:20.120
and misrepresentation

17:20.120 --> 17:21.120
by these trenders.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.120
You said on air

17:22.120 --> 17:23.120
that Baltimore

17:23.120 --> 17:24.120
grosses you out.

17:24.120 --> 17:25.120
Do you really

17:25.120 --> 17:26.120
expect me to believe

17:26.120 --> 17:27.120
that you have

17:27.120 --> 17:28.120
anything to do

17:28.120 --> 17:29.120
with your own

17:29.120 --> 17:30.120
self-loathing?

17:30.120 --> 17:31.120
How could it be

17:31.120 --> 17:32.120
self-loathing

17:32.120 --> 17:33.120
when Baltimore

17:33.120 --> 17:34.120
is nothing

17:34.120 --> 17:35.120
like me?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.120
Okay,

17:36.120 --> 17:37.120
then it's just bigotry.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.120
That's even worse.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.120
Oh,

17:39.120 --> 17:40.120
it's not bigotry.

17:40.120 --> 17:41.120
Look,

17:41.120 --> 17:42.120
I shouldn't have said

17:42.120 --> 17:43.120
grossed out,

17:43.120 --> 17:44.120
I'll give you that,

17:44.120 --> 17:45.120
but he does,

17:45.120 --> 17:46.120
they do

17:46.120 --> 17:47.120
make me uncomfortable.

17:47.120 --> 17:48.120
And why do you

17:48.120 --> 17:49.120
think that is?

17:49.120 --> 17:50.120
Ugh,

17:50.120 --> 17:51.120
I got secondhand dysphoria

17:51.120 --> 17:52.120
looking at someone

17:52.120 --> 17:53.120
so burgeoning.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.120
Ugh,

17:54.120 --> 17:55.120
it makes me want

17:55.120 --> 17:56.120
to down a bottle

17:56.120 --> 17:57.120
of whiskey

17:57.120 --> 17:58.120
and you just

17:58.120 --> 17:59.120
clock everything

17:59.120 --> 18:00.120
and you feel like

18:00.120 --> 18:01.120
sympathetic

18:01.120 --> 18:02.120
vibrations

18:02.120 --> 18:03.120
of dysphoria.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.120
Yeah,

18:04.120 --> 18:05.120
I do know

18:05.120 --> 18:06.120
what you're talking about

18:06.120 --> 18:07.120
and I'll tell you

18:07.120 --> 18:08.120
why it happens.

18:08.120 --> 18:09.120
When you're early

18:09.120 --> 18:10.120
in your transition

18:10.120 --> 18:11.120
and you're doing

18:11.120 --> 18:12.120
everything you can

18:12.120 --> 18:13.120
to pass,

18:13.120 --> 18:14.120
you develop

18:14.120 --> 18:15.120
a really sophisticated eye

18:15.120 --> 18:16.120
for every little thing

18:16.120 --> 18:17.120
that makes you clockable.

18:17.120 --> 18:18.120
Then,

18:18.120 --> 18:19.120
you turn that

18:19.120 --> 18:20.120
sophisticated eye

18:20.120 --> 18:21.120
onto other

18:21.120 --> 18:22.120
trans people

18:22.120 --> 18:23.120
and you project

18:23.120 --> 18:24.120
your dysphoria

18:24.120 --> 18:25.120
onto them.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.120
I buy that.

18:26.120 --> 18:27.120
This is

18:27.120 --> 18:28.120
other trans people's

18:28.120 --> 18:29.120
presentation.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.120
Secondhand dysphoria

18:30.120 --> 18:31.120
is not valid.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.120
The fact that

18:32.120 --> 18:33.120
you project

18:33.120 --> 18:34.120
your dysphoria

18:34.120 --> 18:35.120
onto other people

18:35.120 --> 18:36.120
is your problem

18:36.120 --> 18:37.120
and your problem alone.

18:37.120 --> 18:38.120
And you need to deal

18:38.120 --> 18:39.120
with that issue

18:39.120 --> 18:40.120
in private,

18:40.120 --> 18:41.120
girl,

18:41.120 --> 18:42.120
not on a fucking

18:42.120 --> 18:43.120
talk show.

18:43.120 --> 18:44.120
Yeah,

18:44.120 --> 18:45.120
you're probably

18:45.120 --> 18:46.120
right about that.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.120
But it still

18:47.120 --> 18:48.120
doesn't make

18:48.120 --> 18:49.120
Baltimore,

18:49.120 --> 18:50.120
Maryland

18:50.120 --> 18:51.120
any more valid.

18:51.120 --> 18:52.120
Tiffany,

18:52.120 --> 18:53.120
let's be pragmatic

18:53.120 --> 18:54.120
about this.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.120
Suppose everything

18:55.120 --> 18:56.120
you do

18:56.120 --> 18:57.120
is for the

18:57.120 --> 18:58.120
sake

18:58.120 --> 18:59.120
of

18:59.120 --> 19:00.120
transsexuals.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.120
Every time

19:01.120 --> 19:02.120
you say the word

19:02.120 --> 19:03.120
transsexual,

19:03.120 --> 19:04.120
I feel like

19:04.120 --> 19:05.120
it's 1978.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.120
Are you 80 years old?

19:06.120 --> 19:07.120
I guess you could say

19:07.120 --> 19:08.120
I'm not the trendiest person.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.120
Haha.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.120
Look,

19:10.120 --> 19:11.120
suppose you're right

19:11.120 --> 19:12.120
and everyone

19:12.120 --> 19:13.120
who doesn't meet

19:13.120 --> 19:14.120
your definition

19:14.120 --> 19:15.120
of a transsexual

19:15.120 --> 19:16.120
is some kind of

19:16.120 --> 19:17.120
confused trend follower.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.120
Even if that were true,

19:18.120 --> 19:19.120
and to be clear,

19:19.120 --> 19:20.120
it isn't,

19:20.120 --> 19:21.120
what you're doing

19:21.120 --> 19:22.120
harms

19:22.120 --> 19:23.120
even the trans people

19:23.120 --> 19:24.120
you think are valid

19:24.120 --> 19:25.120
about their gender

19:25.120 --> 19:26.120
and of having

19:26.120 --> 19:27.120
non-conforming expression

19:27.120 --> 19:28.120
and you're going around

19:28.120 --> 19:29.120
enforcing a stigma

19:29.120 --> 19:30.120
against that.

19:30.120 --> 19:31.120
Didn't you ever

19:31.120 --> 19:32.120
have doubts

19:32.120 --> 19:33.120
about your gender?

19:33.120 --> 19:34.120
Weren't you ever

19:34.120 --> 19:35.120
androgynous?

19:35.120 --> 19:36.120
Oh yeah,

19:36.120 --> 19:37.120
I mean,

19:37.120 --> 19:38.120
I was never

19:38.120 --> 19:39.120
that burgeoning,

19:39.120 --> 19:40.120
but I had my little

19:40.120 --> 19:41.120
cringe here

19:41.120 --> 19:42.120
being a non-binary

19:42.120 --> 19:43.120
SJW.

19:43.120 --> 19:44.120
Uh huh.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.120
And one of the great

19:45.120 --> 19:46.120
things about

19:46.120 --> 19:47.120
non-binary identities

19:47.120 --> 19:48.120
is they give

19:48.120 --> 19:49.120
trans people

19:49.120 --> 19:50.120
the conceptual

19:50.120 --> 19:51.120
space to exist

19:51.120 --> 19:52.120
even when

19:52.120 --> 19:53.120
neither gender

19:53.120 --> 19:54.120
confuses them.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.120
Has it occurred to you

19:55.120 --> 19:56.120
that being shamed

19:56.120 --> 19:57.120
and berated

19:57.120 --> 19:58.120
for being a trender

19:58.120 --> 19:59.120
during your

19:59.120 --> 20:00.120
exploration year

20:00.120 --> 20:01.120
might not have been

20:01.120 --> 20:02.120
the most helpful thing?

20:02.120 --> 20:03.120
Not really.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.120
I have dysphoria

20:04.120 --> 20:05.120
so if anyone

20:05.120 --> 20:06.120
called me a trender

20:06.120 --> 20:07.120
I'd eventually

20:07.120 --> 20:08.120
prove them wrong.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.120
That's all I'm saying.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.120
If you're not a trender,

20:10.120 --> 20:11.120
then transition.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.120
Prove me wrong.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.120
The stigma

20:13.120 --> 20:14.120
you perpetuate

20:14.120 --> 20:15.120
against gender confusion

20:15.120 --> 20:16.120
and experimentation

20:16.120 --> 20:17.120
keeps trans people

20:17.120 --> 20:18.120
in the closet

20:18.120 --> 20:19.120
and delays transition.

20:19.120 --> 20:20.120
It alienates

20:20.120 --> 20:21.120
baby trans

20:21.120 --> 20:22.120
from the community

20:22.120 --> 20:23.120
instead of publicly

20:23.120 --> 20:24.120
humiliating them.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.120
And when you

20:25.120 --> 20:26.120
appoint yourself

20:26.120 --> 20:27.120
the public decider

20:27.120 --> 20:28.120
of whomst is

20:28.120 --> 20:29.120
really trans,

20:29.120 --> 20:30.120
the Torquemada

20:30.120 --> 20:31.120
of the trender

20:31.120 --> 20:32.120
inquisition,

20:32.120 --> 20:33.120
you're terrorizing

20:33.120 --> 20:34.120
a lot of people

20:34.120 --> 20:35.120
who are genuinely

20:35.120 --> 20:36.120
trying to figure

20:36.120 --> 20:37.120
themselves out.

20:37.120 --> 20:38.120
Okay.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.120
But then

20:39.120 --> 20:40.120
how do we decide

20:40.120 --> 20:41.120
which trendies

20:41.120 --> 20:42.120
are valid?

20:42.120 --> 20:43.120
We don't.

20:43.120 --> 20:44.120
Then this is

20:44.120 --> 20:45.120
where I'm losing you.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.120
Because trans trenders

20:46.120 --> 20:47.120
are absolutely a thing.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.120
Like, undeniably.

20:48.120 --> 20:49.120
I've talked to people

20:49.120 --> 20:50.120
who've literally told me

20:50.120 --> 20:51.120
they used to be

20:51.120 --> 20:52.120
trans trenders.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.120
Some people

20:53.120 --> 20:54.120
question their gender

20:54.120 --> 20:55.120
but end up deciding

20:55.120 --> 20:56.120
they're not really trans.

20:56.120 --> 20:57.120
There is nothing

20:57.120 --> 20:58.120
wrong with that.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.120
And those people

20:59.120 --> 21:00.120
still aren't being helped

21:00.120 --> 21:01.120
by public shaming.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.120
Well, maybe they wouldn't

21:02.120 --> 21:03.120
be confused in the first place

21:03.120 --> 21:04.120
if SJWs weren't

21:04.120 --> 21:05.120
going around

21:05.120 --> 21:06.120
telling people

21:06.120 --> 21:07.120
they don't need dysphoria

21:07.120 --> 21:08.120
to be trans.

21:08.120 --> 21:09.120
You know,

21:09.120 --> 21:10.120
it's one thing

21:10.120 --> 21:11.120
if teenage girls

21:11.120 --> 21:12.120
want to dye their hair pink

21:12.120 --> 21:13.120
and call themselves

21:13.120 --> 21:14.120
Demi Boys

21:14.120 --> 21:15.120
for most of sophomore year.

21:15.120 --> 21:16.120
But some of these kids

21:16.120 --> 21:17.120
are actually gonna

21:17.120 --> 21:18.120
medically transition.

21:18.120 --> 21:19.120
And soon,

21:19.120 --> 21:20.120
we're gonna have

21:20.120 --> 21:21.120
an epidemic

21:21.120 --> 21:22.120
of detransitioners

21:22.120 --> 21:23.120
who told you so

21:23.120 --> 21:24.120
op-eds

21:24.120 --> 21:25.120
in every major newspaper.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.120
Now, maybe you think

21:26.120 --> 21:27.120
that's worth it

21:27.120 --> 21:28.120
just to make sure

21:28.120 --> 21:29.120
no one ever feels

21:29.120 --> 21:30.120
invalidated

21:30.120 --> 21:31.120
for any reason.

21:31.120 --> 21:32.120
But I think

21:32.120 --> 21:33.120
that's highly irresponsible.

21:33.120 --> 21:34.120
Look,

21:34.120 --> 21:35.120
if you're so worried

21:35.120 --> 21:36.120
about people

21:36.120 --> 21:37.120
feeling pressured

21:37.120 --> 21:38.120
to medically transition,

21:38.120 --> 21:39.120
then what you should be doing

21:39.120 --> 21:40.120
is working to make

21:40.120 --> 21:41.120
the trans community

21:41.120 --> 21:42.120
as inclusive

21:42.120 --> 21:43.120
and welcoming

21:43.120 --> 21:44.120
as possible

21:44.120 --> 21:45.120
to gender non-conforming people

21:45.120 --> 21:46.120
and non-binary people

21:46.120 --> 21:47.120
and people

21:47.120 --> 21:48.120
who are questioning

21:48.120 --> 21:49.120
and trans people

21:49.120 --> 21:50.120
who don't medically transition.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.120
But instead,

21:51.120 --> 21:52.120
you're doing

21:52.120 --> 21:53.120
the exact opposite.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.120
You're telling everyone

21:54.120 --> 21:55.120
that medical transition

21:55.120 --> 21:56.120
is the only way

21:56.120 --> 21:57.120
to be valid.

21:57.120 --> 21:58.120
And if anything

21:58.120 --> 21:59.120
is pressuring people

21:59.120 --> 22:00.120
to medically transition,

22:00.120 --> 22:01.120
it's that.

22:01.120 --> 22:02.120
Justine,

22:02.120 --> 22:03.120
I think

22:03.120 --> 22:04.120
you're a good person.

22:04.120 --> 22:05.120
Maybe too good.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.120
And that's why

22:06.120 --> 22:07.120
you're trying

22:07.120 --> 22:08.120
to have compassion

22:08.120 --> 22:09.120
for everyone.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.120
But at some point,

22:10.120 --> 22:11.120
you have to protect yourself.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.120
We live in a world

22:12.120 --> 22:13.120
of Jackie Jacksons

22:13.120 --> 22:14.120
who don't understand

22:14.120 --> 22:15.120
trans people

22:15.120 --> 22:16.120
and don't think

22:16.120 --> 22:17.120
we're real.

22:17.120 --> 22:18.120
So we need to have

22:18.120 --> 22:19.120
an explanation

22:19.120 --> 22:20.120
of what it is

22:20.120 --> 22:21.120
to be trans

22:21.120 --> 22:22.120
and not feelings.

22:22.120 --> 22:23.120
And the most factual

22:23.120 --> 22:24.120
explanation

22:24.120 --> 22:25.120
is transmedicalism,

22:25.120 --> 22:26.120
which is the idea

22:26.120 --> 22:27.120
that transsexualism

22:27.120 --> 22:28.120
is a diagnosable

22:28.120 --> 22:29.120
mental disorder

22:29.120 --> 22:30.120
called gender dysphoria.

22:30.120 --> 22:31.120
There's science

22:31.120 --> 22:32.120
to back this up.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.120
It's accepted

22:33.120 --> 22:34.120
by medical professionals

22:34.120 --> 22:35.120
and it clearly explains

22:35.120 --> 22:37.120
why we are valid

22:37.120 --> 22:38.120
unlike Rachel Dolezal

22:38.120 --> 22:39.120
and snowflake

22:39.120 --> 22:40.120
gender teenagers

22:40.120 --> 22:41.120
and people

22:41.120 --> 22:42.120
who identify

22:42.120 --> 22:43.120
as cats.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.120
Okay,

22:44.120 --> 22:45.120
I see the appeal

22:45.120 --> 22:46.120
but I don't think

22:46.120 --> 22:47.120
transmedicalism

22:47.120 --> 22:48.120
is as validating

22:48.120 --> 22:49.120
as you think it is.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.120
Why not?

22:50.120 --> 22:51.120
Apparently.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.120
Why does having

22:52.120 --> 22:53.120
gender dysphoria

22:53.120 --> 22:54.120
make you a woman?

22:54.120 --> 22:55.120
Because gender dysphoria

22:55.120 --> 22:56.120
means I have

22:56.120 --> 22:57.120
a female brain.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.120
No it doesn't.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.120
I'm sorry to tell you

22:59.120 --> 23:00.120
but the science

23:00.120 --> 23:01.120
does not say

23:01.120 --> 23:02.120
what you think it says.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.120
There may be neurological

23:03.120 --> 23:04.120
causes of gender dysphoria

23:04.120 --> 23:05.120
but at the end

23:05.120 --> 23:06.120
of the day

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
all dysphoria is

23:07.120 --> 23:08.120
is discomfort

23:08.120 --> 23:09.120
in a male body

23:09.120 --> 23:10.120
or a male social role

23:10.120 --> 23:11.120
or however you want

23:11.120 --> 23:12.120
to put it.

23:12.120 --> 23:13.120
And wanting

23:13.120 --> 23:14.120
to be a woman

23:14.120 --> 23:15.120
is not the same thing

23:15.120 --> 23:17.120
as being a woman.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.120
Not by any means.

23:19.120 --> 23:20.120
Girl, where are you

23:20.120 --> 23:21.120
going with this?

23:21.120 --> 23:22.120
What is this?

23:22.120 --> 23:23.120
Are you becoming

23:23.120 --> 23:24.120
a TERF?

23:24.120 --> 23:25.120
No, I just don't think

23:25.120 --> 23:26.120
your theory actually validates

23:26.120 --> 23:27.120
our womanhood.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.120
Well if you're right

23:28.120 --> 23:29.120
that's a real problem

23:29.120 --> 23:30.120
because we need

23:30.120 --> 23:31.120
to have reason

23:31.120 --> 23:32.120
and science

23:32.120 --> 23:33.120
and logic

23:33.120 --> 23:34.120
and facts

23:34.120 --> 23:35.120
on our side

23:35.120 --> 23:36.120
so that we can explain

23:36.120 --> 23:37.120
to society

23:37.120 --> 23:38.120
that we are valid

23:38.120 --> 23:39.120
and that we are real

23:39.120 --> 23:40.120
otherwise

23:40.120 --> 23:41.120
bad things.

23:41.120 --> 23:42.120
Well maybe there's

23:42.120 --> 23:43.120
a better theory.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.120
Well okay Socrates

23:44.120 --> 23:45.120
let's hear it then.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.120
The way I see it

23:46.120 --> 23:47.120
gender is either

23:47.120 --> 23:48.120
psychological

23:48.120 --> 23:49.120
or biological

23:49.120 --> 23:50.120
or social.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.120
Now my friend Tabby

23:51.120 --> 23:52.120
the cat girl

23:52.120 --> 23:53.120
she thinks it's

23:53.120 --> 23:54.120
all psychological

23:54.120 --> 23:55.120
that it's just

23:55.120 --> 23:56.120
identity

23:56.120 --> 23:57.120
that whatever you think

23:57.120 --> 23:58.120
about your own gender

23:58.120 --> 23:59.120
is true.

23:59.120 --> 24:00.120
And that makes me

24:00.120 --> 24:01.120
really uncomfortable

24:01.120 --> 24:02.120
because then

24:02.120 --> 24:03.120
what's the difference

24:03.120 --> 24:04.120
between identifying

24:04.120 --> 24:05.120
as a woman

24:05.120 --> 24:06.120
and identifying

24:06.120 --> 24:07.120
as a Norwegian forest cat?

24:07.120 --> 24:08.120
It's a difference

24:08.120 --> 24:09.120
that Tabby herself

24:09.120 --> 24:10.120
seems not to have

24:10.120 --> 24:11.120
much of a grip on.

24:11.120 --> 24:12.120
Girl that's literally

24:12.120 --> 24:13.120
what I've been trying

24:13.120 --> 24:14.120
to tell you about

24:14.120 --> 24:15.120
trans-trenders

24:15.120 --> 24:16.120
this entire time.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.120
Just let me finish.

24:17.120 --> 24:18.120
If gender is strictly

24:18.120 --> 24:19.120
biological

24:19.120 --> 24:20.120
it doesn't influence people

24:20.120 --> 24:21.120
unless you make

24:21.120 --> 24:22.120
some kind of

24:22.120 --> 24:23.120
wrong brain

24:23.120 --> 24:24.120
and the wrong body argument

24:24.120 --> 24:25.120
but I told you

24:25.120 --> 24:26.120
I'm not buying that.

24:26.120 --> 24:27.120
So that leaves

24:27.120 --> 24:28.120
gender as a social construct.

24:28.120 --> 24:29.120
Are you going to try

24:29.120 --> 24:30.120
to make me read

24:30.120 --> 24:31.120
Judith Butler again?

24:31.120 --> 24:32.120
I'll summarize it.

24:32.120 --> 24:33.120
Gender is a series

24:33.120 --> 24:34.120
of gestures.

24:34.120 --> 24:35.120
It's called performativity.

24:35.120 --> 24:36.120
It's the way you dress.

24:36.120 --> 24:37.120
It's the way you speak.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.120
It's the way you act.

24:38.120 --> 24:39.120
It's the way you relate

24:39.120 --> 24:40.120
to other people.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.120
Through transitioning

24:41.120 --> 24:42.120
we habituate

24:42.120 --> 24:43.120
to the gestures

24:43.120 --> 24:44.120
of womanhood

24:44.120 --> 24:45.120
and socially

24:45.120 --> 24:46.120
that makes us women

24:46.120 --> 24:47.120
regardless of

24:47.120 --> 24:48.120
biology or psychology

24:48.120 --> 24:49.120
checkmate

24:49.120 --> 24:50.120
or transphobe.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.120
Okay.

24:53.120 --> 24:54.120
The problem with that

24:54.120 --> 24:55.120
is that it's both

24:55.120 --> 24:56.120
too exclusionary

24:56.120 --> 24:57.120
and too inclusive.

24:57.120 --> 24:58.120
It excludes

24:58.120 --> 24:59.120
a lot of trans people

24:59.120 --> 25:00.120
who can't transition

25:00.120 --> 25:02.120
for circumstantial reasons

25:02.120 --> 25:03.120
but whose dysphoria

25:03.120 --> 25:04.120
is very real.

25:04.120 --> 25:05.120
And it includes

25:05.120 --> 25:06.120
every trans-trender

25:06.120 --> 25:07.120
drag queen

25:07.120 --> 25:08.120
fetishist

25:08.120 --> 25:09.120
and two-bit

25:09.120 --> 25:10.120
cross-dressing comedian

25:10.120 --> 25:11.120
in a dine-out wig.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.120
Well,

25:13.120 --> 25:14.120
do you really believe

25:14.120 --> 25:15.120
that a man who plays

25:15.120 --> 25:16.120
a woman on stage

25:16.120 --> 25:17.120
becomes just as much

25:17.120 --> 25:18.120
of a woman

25:18.120 --> 25:19.120
as you and me?

25:19.120 --> 25:20.120
Uh,

25:20.120 --> 25:21.120
yes?

25:21.120 --> 25:22.120
Bitch,

25:22.120 --> 25:23.120
no you don't.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.120
Yeah,

25:24.120 --> 25:25.120
you're right.

25:25.120 --> 25:26.120
I'm full of shit.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.120
I know you are

25:27.120 --> 25:28.120
because you're an SJW

25:28.120 --> 25:29.120
and SJWs hate

25:29.120 --> 25:30.120
performativity theory

25:30.120 --> 25:31.120
almost as much

25:31.120 --> 25:32.120
as they hate me.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.120
Well,

25:33.120 --> 25:34.120
they only hate it

25:34.120 --> 25:35.120
because they don't understand it.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.120
They think it invalidates

25:36.120 --> 25:37.120
non-binary identities

25:37.120 --> 25:38.120
but in fact

25:38.120 --> 25:39.120
it's the most rational way

25:39.120 --> 25:40.120
to explain

25:40.120 --> 25:41.120
non-binary identities.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.120
How can you perform

25:42.120 --> 25:43.120
a non-binary identity?

25:43.120 --> 25:44.120
Simple.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.120
You learn the rules

25:45.120 --> 25:46.120
so you can break them.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.120
Wearing a beard

25:47.120 --> 25:48.120
and a dress

25:48.120 --> 25:49.120
and the gesture

25:49.120 --> 25:50.120
of declaring

25:50.120 --> 25:51.120
I am neither a man

25:51.120 --> 25:52.120
or a woman

25:52.120 --> 25:53.120
is a speech act

25:53.120 --> 25:54.120
that removes the speaker

25:54.120 --> 25:55.120
from the semantics

25:55.120 --> 25:56.120
Girl,

25:56.120 --> 25:57.120
shut up.

25:57.120 --> 25:58.120
This is too much philosophizing.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.120
I can't stand it anymore.

25:59.120 --> 26:00.120
Why don't you tell me

26:00.120 --> 26:01.120
what's really going on with you?

26:01.120 --> 26:02.120
Why do you look like

26:02.120 --> 26:03.120
you've been in a k-hole

26:03.120 --> 26:04.120
for a week?

26:04.120 --> 26:05.120
Why are you suddenly

26:05.120 --> 26:06.120
so obsessed

26:06.120 --> 26:07.120
with white knighting

26:07.120 --> 26:08.120
for non-binary people?

26:08.120 --> 26:09.120
Because I am non-binary.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.120
No you're not.

26:11.120 --> 26:12.120
What are you talking about?

26:13.120 --> 26:14.120
I just

26:14.120 --> 26:15.120
feel like

26:15.120 --> 26:16.120
since I started transitioning

26:16.120 --> 26:17.120
I've been trying

26:17.120 --> 26:18.120
so hard

26:18.120 --> 26:19.120
to fit in

26:19.120 --> 26:20.120
and to perform

26:20.120 --> 26:21.120
my gender

26:21.120 --> 26:22.120
and to pass

26:22.120 --> 26:23.120
and to just be normal.

26:23.120 --> 26:24.120
But I can't do it anymore.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.120
I just cannot

26:25.120 --> 26:26.120
make it work.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.120
I feel like an actor.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.120
I feel like a zombie.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.120
Like I'm

26:29.120 --> 26:30.120
going through

26:30.120 --> 26:31.120
the motions

26:31.120 --> 26:32.120
of this new gender role

26:32.120 --> 26:33.120
that's supposed

26:33.120 --> 26:34.120
to liberate me

26:34.120 --> 26:35.120
but that's somehow

26:35.120 --> 26:36.120
just as empty

26:36.120 --> 26:37.120
as the old one.

26:37.120 --> 26:38.120
Because I'm just

26:38.120 --> 26:39.120
not normal, Tiffany.

26:39.120 --> 26:40.120
I am a freak.

26:40.120 --> 26:41.120
And I'm always

26:41.120 --> 26:42.120
gonna be a freak.

26:42.120 --> 26:43.120
Justine,

26:43.120 --> 26:44.120
you're not non-binary.

26:44.120 --> 26:45.120
You're gay.

26:45.120 --> 26:46.120
And everyone

26:46.120 --> 26:47.120
can see this

26:47.120 --> 26:48.120
Oh come on.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.120
I'm not

26:49.120 --> 26:50.120
I'm not

26:50.120 --> 26:51.120
gay.

26:51.120 --> 26:52.120
Justine

26:52.120 --> 26:53.120
was extremely

26:53.120 --> 26:54.120
gay.

26:55.120 --> 26:56.120
In protest

26:56.120 --> 26:57.120
to the Lady May

26:57.120 --> 26:58.120
there simply

26:58.120 --> 26:59.120
is no stopping

26:59.120 --> 27:00.120
gayness.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.120
I love

27:01.120 --> 27:02.120
cat girls.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.120
I hate

27:05.120 --> 27:06.120
cat girls

27:06.120 --> 27:07.120
but I also

27:07.120 --> 27:08.120
love them.

27:08.120 --> 27:09.120
Oh

27:09.120 --> 27:10.120
abominable

27:10.120 --> 27:11.120
fate.

27:11.120 --> 27:12.120
Okay.

27:12.120 --> 27:13.120
So I'm a little bit

27:13.120 --> 27:14.120
gay.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.120
Right.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.120
And you don't know

27:16.120 --> 27:17.120
how to reconcile

27:17.120 --> 27:18.120
your gender.

27:18.120 --> 27:19.120
That's why you feel

27:19.120 --> 27:20.120
this dissonance.

27:20.120 --> 27:21.120
Yeah.

27:21.120 --> 27:22.120
I guess that's

27:22.120 --> 27:23.120
basically it.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.120
Well it really shouldn't

27:24.120 --> 27:25.120
be that hard, girl.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.120
You already came out

27:26.120 --> 27:27.120
as a woman.

27:27.120 --> 27:28.120
Just blurt it out.

27:28.120 --> 27:29.120
Say,

27:29.120 --> 27:30.120
Hello world.

27:30.120 --> 27:31.120
My name is Justine

27:31.120 --> 27:32.120
and I fuck

27:32.120 --> 27:33.120
pussy.

27:33.120 --> 27:34.120
That's a very

27:34.120 --> 27:35.120
cis-normative way to

27:35.120 --> 27:36.120
Say it.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.120
Hello world.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.120
My name is Justine

27:38.120 --> 27:39.120
and I fuck

27:39.120 --> 27:40.120
pussy.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.120
Ugh.

27:41.120 --> 27:42.120
I feel like a man

27:42.120 --> 27:43.120
when I say it.

27:43.120 --> 27:44.120
Yeah.

27:44.120 --> 27:45.120
Well you should

27:45.120 --> 27:46.120
probably buy a pickup

27:46.120 --> 27:47.120
then.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.120
Get some of those

27:48.120 --> 27:49.120
mud flaps on the back

27:49.120 --> 27:50.120
with the little sexy

27:50.120 --> 27:51.120
ladies on them

27:51.120 --> 27:52.120
and you may as well

27:52.120 --> 27:53.120
change your name

27:53.120 --> 27:54.120
back to Justine.

27:54.120 --> 27:55.120
Okay.

27:55.120 --> 27:56.120
Well that's just

27:56.120 --> 27:57.120
uncalled for.

27:57.120 --> 27:58.120
Girl, I don't know

27:58.120 --> 27:59.120
what to say except

27:59.120 --> 28:00.120
I told you so.

28:00.120 --> 28:01.120
Sexuality is just

28:01.120 --> 28:02.120
like gender identity.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.120
It is not a performance.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.120
It's not a trend.

28:04.120 --> 28:05.120
It's not a choice.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.120
It's just part of

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
who you are

28:07.120 --> 28:08.120
and there's nothing

28:08.120 --> 28:09.120
you can do to change it.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.120
I guess you're right.

28:11.120 --> 28:12.120
I guess my theory

28:12.120 --> 28:13.120
sucks.

28:13.120 --> 28:14.120
It sucks so fucking

28:14.120 --> 28:15.120
hard.

28:15.120 --> 28:16.120
But the good news

28:16.120 --> 28:17.120
is you can unclench

28:17.120 --> 28:18.120
your asshole now

28:18.120 --> 28:19.120
and do whatever you

28:19.120 --> 28:20.120
want because you're

28:20.120 --> 28:21.120
still a woman

28:21.120 --> 28:22.120
whether you're

28:22.120 --> 28:23.120
performing a stereotype

28:23.120 --> 28:24.120
or not.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.120
So run free,

28:25.120 --> 28:26.120
Justine.

28:26.120 --> 28:27.120
Go top a cis woman.

28:27.120 --> 28:28.120
Bang a gay guy.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.120
Wear some oversized

28:29.120 --> 28:30.120
flannel.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.120
Do whatever you

28:31.120 --> 28:32.120
want.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.120
Wow.

28:33.120 --> 28:34.120
Yeah.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.120
I guess that is

28:35.120 --> 28:36.120
pretty liberating.

28:36.120 --> 28:37.120
Yeah.

28:37.120 --> 28:38.120
Thank God for

28:38.120 --> 28:39.120
transmedicalism,

28:39.120 --> 28:40.120
right?

28:40.120 --> 28:41.120
Oh, except not

28:41.120 --> 28:42.120
because you just

28:42.120 --> 28:43.120
destroyed transmedicalism

28:43.120 --> 28:44.120
with facts and logic

28:44.120 --> 28:45.120
so we have no theory.

28:45.120 --> 28:46.120
What do we do now?

28:46.120 --> 28:47.120
How do we prove

28:47.120 --> 28:48.120
we're valid?

28:48.120 --> 28:49.120
Well, just do what

28:49.120 --> 28:50.120
every trans woman

28:50.120 --> 28:51.120
has done since

28:51.120 --> 28:52.120
the beginning of time.

28:52.120 --> 28:53.120
Go out and fuck

28:53.120 --> 28:54.120
the most brutally

28:54.120 --> 28:55.120
heterosexual man

28:55.120 --> 28:56.120
you can find

28:56.120 --> 28:57.120
and be validated

28:57.120 --> 28:58.120
and come.

28:58.120 --> 28:59.120
Oh, honey,

28:59.120 --> 29:00.120
I have and I will

29:00.120 --> 29:01.120
but that's not going

29:01.120 --> 29:02.120
to convince anyone

29:02.120 --> 29:03.120
but me.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.120
It's not a proof.

29:04.120 --> 29:05.120
It's not a theory.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.120
Well, maybe

29:06.120 --> 29:07.120
we don't need a theory.

29:07.120 --> 29:08.120
Maybe we don't need

29:08.120 --> 29:09.120
to prove anything.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.120
Bad things,

29:10.120 --> 29:11.120
Justine.

29:11.120 --> 29:12.120
Bad things.

29:12.120 --> 29:13.120
Do we have a theory

29:13.120 --> 29:14.120
about why people

29:14.120 --> 29:15.120
are trans?

29:15.120 --> 29:16.120
No.

29:16.120 --> 29:17.120
They just are.

29:17.120 --> 29:18.120
The only reason

29:18.120 --> 29:19.120
we even feel like

29:19.120 --> 29:20.120
we need a theory

29:20.120 --> 29:21.120
about trans people

29:21.120 --> 29:22.120
is that society

29:22.120 --> 29:23.120
is so unaccepting

29:23.120 --> 29:24.120
of us

29:24.120 --> 29:25.120
that it's constantly

29:25.120 --> 29:26.120
demanding we justify

29:26.120 --> 29:27.120
our own reality.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.120
Okay.

29:28.120 --> 29:29.120
So what am I supposed

29:29.120 --> 29:30.120
to tell Jackie Jackson

29:30.120 --> 29:31.120
then?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
What am I supposed

29:32.120 --> 29:33.120
to tell the TERFs?

29:33.120 --> 29:34.120
That I'm a woman

29:34.120 --> 29:35.120
because reasons?

29:35.120 --> 29:36.120
No.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.120
Not even because reasons.

29:37.120 --> 29:38.120
Just because you are.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.120
So it's what?

29:39.120 --> 29:40.120
A leap of faith?

29:40.120 --> 29:41.120
Oh, great.

29:41.120 --> 29:42.120
I'm sure that's

29:42.120 --> 29:43.120
going to convince

29:43.120 --> 29:44.120
us to believe

29:44.120 --> 29:45.120
that we are

29:45.120 --> 29:46.120
trans.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.120
It makes us sound

29:47.120 --> 29:48.120
completely delusional.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.120
Well, Tiffany,

29:49.120 --> 29:50.120
delusion

29:50.120 --> 29:51.120
is what separates

29:51.120 --> 29:52.120
us from the animals.

29:52.120 --> 29:53.120
Who do you think

29:53.120 --> 29:54.120
built the pyramids

29:54.120 --> 29:55.120
and the cathedrals?

29:55.120 --> 29:56.120
Clearly not people

29:56.120 --> 29:57.120
with a perfectly

29:57.120 --> 29:58.120
rational worldview.

29:58.120 --> 29:59.120
But what do you care anyway?

29:59.120 --> 30:00.120
Aren't you the one

30:00.120 --> 30:01.120
who thinks being trans

30:01.120 --> 30:02.120
is a mental disorder?

30:02.120 --> 30:03.120
Well, I wouldn't

30:03.120 --> 30:04.120
describe it as

30:04.120 --> 30:05.120
the height of sanity,

30:05.120 --> 30:06.120
but I would prefer

30:06.120 --> 30:07.120
to think that my whole

30:07.120 --> 30:08.120
life and identity

30:08.120 --> 30:09.120
is based on something

30:09.120 --> 30:10.120
I can rationally explain.

30:10.120 --> 30:11.120
Well, what are we, Tiffany?

30:11.120 --> 30:12.120
Men?

30:12.120 --> 30:13.120
Can we wrap up

30:13.120 --> 30:14.120
the entire world

30:14.120 --> 30:15.120
in a little

30:15.120 --> 30:16.120
rational box?

30:16.120 --> 30:17.120
Maybe the most

30:17.120 --> 30:18.120
important things

30:18.120 --> 30:19.120
in life can't

30:19.120 --> 30:20.120
be logically proved.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.120
Can you logically prove

30:21.120 --> 30:22.120
that you love

30:22.120 --> 30:23.120
your own children?

30:23.120 --> 30:24.120
No.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.120
And the attempt

30:25.120 --> 30:26.120
to prove it

30:26.120 --> 30:27.120
is as degrading

30:27.120 --> 30:28.120
as it is futile.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.120
Maybe gender identity

30:29.120 --> 30:30.120
is one of those things.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.120
Okay, but then

30:31.120 --> 30:32.120
how do I prove

30:32.120 --> 30:33.120
I'm more valid

30:33.120 --> 30:34.120
than Baltimore,

30:34.120 --> 30:35.120
Maryland,

30:35.120 --> 30:36.120
and the star genders,

30:36.120 --> 30:37.120
and the cat people?

30:37.120 --> 30:38.120
Well, maybe

30:38.120 --> 30:39.120
we should stop

30:39.120 --> 30:40.120
getting so caught up

30:40.120 --> 30:41.120
in proving

30:41.120 --> 30:42.120
our validity

30:42.120 --> 30:43.120
to ourselves

30:43.120 --> 30:44.120
that we end up

30:44.120 --> 30:45.120
being horribly cruel

30:45.120 --> 30:46.120
to other people.

30:46.120 --> 30:47.120
What if we just

30:47.120 --> 30:48.120
accept all the freaks

30:48.120 --> 30:49.120
of the world?

30:49.120 --> 30:50.120
At the end of the day,

30:50.120 --> 30:51.120
maybe it's just not

30:51.120 --> 30:52.120
as important

30:52.120 --> 30:53.120
to have logical proofs

30:53.120 --> 30:54.120
as it is to be

30:54.120 --> 30:55.120
empathetic

30:55.120 --> 30:56.120
and open-minded

30:56.120 --> 30:57.120
and compassionate.

30:58.120 --> 31:01.120
Kumbaya, my lord,

31:01.120 --> 31:03.120
kumbaya.

31:03.120 --> 31:05.120
Kumbaya, my lord,

31:05.120 --> 31:07.120
kumbaya.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.120
Tiffany.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.120
Kumbaya, my lord,

31:10.120 --> 31:11.120
kumbaya.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.120
Kumbaya, my lord,

31:12.120 --> 31:13.120
kumbaya.

31:13.120 --> 31:14.120
I have something

31:14.120 --> 31:15.120
to tell you.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.120
Here it comes.

31:16.120 --> 31:17.120
I love you.

31:17.120 --> 31:18.120
Okay.

31:18.120 --> 31:19.120
Well, I'm going

31:19.120 --> 31:20.120
to get going now.

31:20.120 --> 31:21.120
I have an important

31:21.120 --> 31:22.120
date tonight,

31:22.120 --> 31:23.120
drinking vodka

31:23.120 --> 31:24.120
cranberries

31:24.120 --> 31:25.120
and reading

31:25.120 --> 31:26.120
YouTube comments

31:26.120 --> 31:27.120
by myself.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.120
So I'd really better

31:28.120 --> 31:29.120
go do that,

31:29.120 --> 31:30.120
but good luck

31:30.120 --> 31:31.120
with your new life

31:31.120 --> 31:32.120
as a male lesbian

31:32.120 --> 31:33.120
who fucks cats.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.120
Ugh.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.120
I love you.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.120
I love you.

31:36.120 --> 31:37.120
I love you.

31:37.120 --> 31:38.120
I love you.

31:38.120 --> 31:39.120
I love you.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.120
I love you.

31:40.120 --> 31:41.120
I love you.

31:41.120 --> 31:42.120
Oh, are you upset?

31:42.120 --> 31:44.120
She has to go.

31:44.120 --> 31:46.120
I'm sorry.

31:49.120 --> 31:52.120
I hate this bitch.

31:52.120 --> 31:53.120
But God,

31:53.120 --> 31:54.120
she's a yum yum.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.120
Hearken, children.

32:01.120 --> 32:02.120
In this vision

32:02.120 --> 32:03.120
ye have witnessed

32:03.120 --> 32:04.120
world fools

32:04.120 --> 32:05.120
upon the screen.

32:05.120 --> 32:06.120
Fools

32:06.120 --> 32:07.120
who do not love

32:07.120 --> 32:08.120
themselves,

32:08.120 --> 32:09.120
but otherwise

32:09.120 --> 32:14.840
I, your goddess, mother, queen, messiah, I am nothing like them.

32:15.200 --> 32:22.560
For I am truth, I am light, I am in capitalism, and everything I tweet is woke.

32:22.940 --> 32:25.800
But most importantly, I love myself.

32:26.280 --> 32:30.300
I love myself so much it makes me wet, it makes me cum.

32:30.300 --> 32:35.840
Praise be up to me, hallelujah, like, comment, and subscribe, amen.

32:39.120 --> 33:09.100
