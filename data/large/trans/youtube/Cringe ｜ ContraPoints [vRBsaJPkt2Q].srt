00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Hello again, the gays.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,960
Welcome to my garden party fantasy.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,240
Straight people, you're of course welcome to tag along too, provided you're emotionally

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,240
damaged!

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,240
Hi!

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,240
Hey, how are you?

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:15,240
Cringe!

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,560
Let's talk about it!

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,200
The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately, it just pops into my head all the

10
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
time.

11
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,400
Like, when I randomly remember that month back in 2013, when all of my Facebook posts

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,280
were just lyrics to Kesha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter, why?

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,940
What audience was that for?

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:35,900
Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?

15
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:36,900
Cringe!

16
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,900
Mega cringe!

17
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,740
I think I say this word like 50 times a day, cringe, cringe, cringe.

18
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,740
And I'm not the only one.

19
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,520
Google Trends shows that in the US, search interest in the word cringe has dramatically

20
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,260
increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since.

21
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,280
And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe has hit an all-time high

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,360
the month I'm making this video.

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,120
So what is cringe?

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,600
Well, let's start with some examples.

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,100
There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled, What Things Really Make You Cringe?

26
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,240
And here are some of the most upvoted responses.

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,720
The time I was talking too loud at a wedding when I wasn't supposed to, and everyone

28
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,800
at the wedding turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

29
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,320
Recordings of my own voice.

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,440
When I remember that I did the, I do have a boyfriend, he just goes to another school

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,440
thing.

32
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,580
Early teen me.

33
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,960
So many cringe stuff I did.

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,240
I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,740
This happened about two years ago.

36
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,060
I ordered some Pizza Hut online, and when it was delivered, the lady handed me the pizza

37
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,060
boxes.

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:35,900
I said thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.

39
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,900
I said, oh.

40
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,820
And then she hands me the receipt to sign and leave a tip, and I spend 30 seconds trying

41
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:42,160
to get the pen to work.

42
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,240
She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.

43
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,240
I said, oh.

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,560
And then she reaches to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good.

45
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
Then I said, you too.

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,120
And then I closed the door and killed myself.

47
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl said.

48
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,280
She said, oh.

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,320
Yeah, this is what I'm seeing.

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
But even though I had a better opinion on myself, I'm still disappointed in myself.

51
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
I'm not gonna be that person.

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
I'm not really that person.

53
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,320
So if she's gonna know who I am, I'm going to have to have to go live.

54
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,320
I don't want to.

55
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,320
She wrote from her book, Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.

56
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,240
According to Dahl,

57
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,780
The moments that make us cringe are when we're yanked out of our own perspective, and we

58
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,880
can suddenly see ourselves from somebody else's point of view.

59
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:12,940
She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who in the 60s did a study of the Biyami tribe

60
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,980
in New Guinea, where he showed them mirror, video and photographic images of themselves

61
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:19,520
for the first time and described the results.

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,100
They were paralyzed after their first startled response, covering their mouths and ducking

63
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:28,740
heads. They stood transfixed, staring at their images, only their stomach muscles betraying

64
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,740
great tension."

65
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:34,780
So basically, they cringed at themselves. Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.

66
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,300
Like pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice when they hear a recording

67
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,860
for the first time. I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating

68
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:46,380
in your head. So when you hear the recording, you realize, oh god, that's how other people

69
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,660
hear me all the time. And you're suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear

70
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:55,020
to yourself, and the way you appear to other people. That's when you cringe, the feeling

71
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,580
Dahl describes as the intense visceral reaction produced by an awkward moment, an unpleasant

72
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:05,460
kind of self-recognition where you suddenly see yourself through someone else's eyes.

73
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:10,160
It's a forced moment of self-awareness, and it usually makes you cognizant of the disappointing

74
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,700
fact that you aren't measuring up to your own self-concept.

75
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,980
When you're talking too loud at a wedding, and suddenly everyone turns around to see

76
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,620
what asshole wouldn't shut up, you suddenly realize how you look to them.

77
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,140
Because we've all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

78
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,620
But this time, you're the asshole. Cringe.

79
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,400
Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe. There's no law

80
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:38,120
of state, or even of etiquette, that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed to speak

81
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,680
at a wedding. It's something you have to intuit based on context. How loud are other people

82
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,100
speaking? Is the ceremony about to begin and we're all supposed to be quiet now?

83
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,560
According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael here, the function of awkwardness

84
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,980
is that it sands social dynamics by smoothing out what even etiquette doesn't rule on.

85
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,500
Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment, for being awkward. It enforces

86
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,860
the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego.

87
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:11,360
And memories of your cringey moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves.

88
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,180
Ten years later, you'll be trying to fall asleep, and for no reason at all, your brain

89
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,180
will decide to remind you of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding, and

90
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,540
of the stupid thing you were doing.

91
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,200
You were saying when everyone turned around to stare at you, and you'll cringe all over

92
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:28,220
again. That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful. Because you look back

93
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:34,880
and you realize, damn, I was the asshole for like, seven consecutive years. Can I just

94
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,080
hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don't know, November?

95
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,420
Now all the examples we've considered so far involve self-cringe, but usually when

96
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:49,100
we talk about cringe on the internet, we're talking about cringing at other people. Popular

97
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,100
subreddits like r slash cringe are often just a way to show that you're not cringing at

98
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,300
other people.

99
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,280
Cringe, cringepix, and cringetopia host videos and images of people behaving in cringey ways.

100
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,740
For instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis, grim moments of lamentation

101
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,720
and cuckoldry, and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter

102
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,740
with black people.

103
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,820
Who let the dogs out? Who? Who?

104
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,920
Ugh. Watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire. It makes me want to crawl out

105
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,040
of my body and escape into another dimension. I think some people feel cringe more intensely

106
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,040
than others.

107
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,420
For me, it's uncomfortable to the point where I will reflexively pause a video like

108
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,260
that because I just can't stand it. In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube

109
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:32,340
videos, which… Sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room.

110
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:37,120
So why is it that cringing at other people hurts in the same way as cringing at yourself?

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,960
Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment,

112
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,860
or secondhand embarrassment. Basically, it's a form of empathy.

113
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:49,380
When you cringe at someone, you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,

114
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,420
just as if if you watch someone fall down the stairs,

115
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,140
you might wince empathetically with their pain.

116
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,960
But there's a problem

117
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,380
with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,

118
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,840
or at least a complication,

119
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,260
which is that in the purest examples of cringe,

120
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:06,120
the person doing the cringey thing isn't feeling embarrassed.

121
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,220
In fact, often they're super confident,

122
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,520
and it's actually their lack of self-awareness

123
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:13,600
about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.

124
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,620
Like when a woman posts

125
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,300
a ridiculously over-face-tuned picture of herself

126
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,780
as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,

127
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,500
or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy

128
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,360
when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.

129
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,060
So in the internet sense of the word,

130
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,020
cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.

131
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,860
Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,

132
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,900
and I do feel embarrassed for her,

133
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:38,320
but she knows it's embarrassing and she feels embarrassed.

134
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,480
You guys are just standing up

135
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,880
because you feel bad that I fell,

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,920
and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.

137
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,020
Nothing about this is cringe.

138
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,140
Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.

139
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,780
Maybe she looks back on it and it's still embarrassing,

140
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:52,040
but I don't cringe at her.

141
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,940
Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone

142
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,420
and cringing with them.

143
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,460
When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her

144
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,100
in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.

145
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,520
My feelings mirror what she's feeling.

146
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,800
But when I'm cringing at someone,

147
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,380
I'm feeling something very different

148
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,320
to what they're feeling.

149
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,080
I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here

150
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,020
because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.

151
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:16,980
Another example is

152
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,900
bad American Idol auditions,

153
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,140
which are quintessential cringe content.

154
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,380
People try out for American Idol

155
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,640
because they think they're good enough singers

156
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,660
to compete in a national competition.

157
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,240
So they're effectively revealing their own delusions

158
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,360
when they show up and sing like this.

159
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,600
Is this the real life?

160
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,880
Or is this just fantasy?

161
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,660
It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.

162
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,540
Most of us are bad singers, right?

163
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,720
When people sing happy birthday at a party,

164
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,560
usually they're singing

165
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,940
different keys at no particular tempo.

166
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,000
But that's not cringe,

167
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,100
because the point of singing happy birthday

168
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:53,480
is not to sound amazing.

169
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,660
Bad American Idol auditions are cringe

170
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,820
because of the contestant's misplaced confidence.

171
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,700
Who are you as good as, in your opinion?

172
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,580
The lead singer from Queen.

173
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,320
It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury

174
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,020
when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog.

175
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:15,400
I admit that watching Red,

176
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,860
I'm actually not in very much pain

177
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,960
when I'm cringing at him.

178
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,140
I laugh at his ludicrous performance,

179
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,480
just like the judges do.

180
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,500
And because he's so cocky,

181
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:26,680
and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,

182
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,220
there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure.

183
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,040
There's almost a sense of karma,

184
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,260
a sense that because of his tragic hubris,

185
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:37,820
he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.

186
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,600
And my sense that he deserves it

187
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,140
suppresses my compassionate response

188
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:45,060
and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have

189
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,820
about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.

190
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:50,540
Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant,

191
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:52,460
Misha, who's there with her mom,

192
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:54,960
and they both seem like such sweethearts.

193
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,700
I do believe in her talent.

194
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,960
That's very much.

195
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,640
And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,

196
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,460
but I'm rooting for her.

197
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,240
And when she embarrasses herself, I feel no joy,

198
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,880
only deep and agonizing cringe.

199
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,700
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

200
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,540
Yikes.

201
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:15,960
My differing reactions to Red and Misha,

202
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,240
track a distinction that Dahl makes

203
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,760
between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.

204
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,320
Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification

205
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,100
with the person you're cringing at.

206
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,020
Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves

207
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,540
in the cringe-worthy moment,

208
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,380
you still feel the embarrassment they would feel

209
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,320
or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware

210
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,380
of how other people were perceiving them.

211
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:41,560
Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,

212
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,840
involves an emotional distancing

213
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,460
from the person you're cringing at.

214
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,260
Just like with compassionate cringe,

215
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,360
you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,

216
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,240
but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,

217
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,360
you feel annoyance and disgust at them,

218
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,360
and maybe even a little schadenfreude.

219
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,840
So these are actually two very different emotional responses,

220
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,400
vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.

221
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,260
We call both feelings cringe,

222
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,200
not because they're similar feelings,

223
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,760
but because they're responses to the same type of situation.

224
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,360
People lacking self-awareness

225
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,460
embarrassing themselves without realizing it.

226
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:18,860
Now, embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,

227
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,960
like pretty unpleasant feelings.

228
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,360
So why are we so fascinated by content

229
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,860
that makes us feel this way?

230
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,360
Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members?

231
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,260
Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos

232
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,060
so popular on YouTube?

233
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,260
Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?

234
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,560
Well, I think the answer to that question depends

235
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,760
on whether we're cringing compassionately or contemptuously.

236
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,460
When I read that Ask Reddit thread

237
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,360
where all the people share their cringe stories,

238
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:47,160
I cringe compassionately.

239
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,360
That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.

240
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,460
And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity

241
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,060
and camaraderie with them.

242
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,860
I recognize myself in them,

243
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,460
and I'm reassured to hear that other people

244
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,060
are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.

245
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:04,460
I'm not the only one who cringes at my past

246
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,960
or at videos of myself.

247
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,660
I'm not the only one who sometimes says,

248
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:10,460
you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.

249
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,860
When we collectively laugh at these situations,

250
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,360
we're bonding over our shared human frailty.

251
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,560
We're recognizing that we all say the wrong things sometimes.

252
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,560
That we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion,

253
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,360
only to later educate ourselves

254
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,560
and realize how ignorant and wrong we were.

255
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,760
That we've all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable,

256
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,960
as beautiful and talented and badass,

257
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,360
only to totally miss the mark

258
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,160
and completely embarrass ourselves.

259
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,560
And laughing at our shared absurdity,

260
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,860
our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses,

261
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,560
it makes us feel less alone.

262
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:45,260
Now, this is all, of course, assuming

263
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,260
that we're cringing compassionately.

264
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:51,660
But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet

265
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,560
does not encourage compassion.

266
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,560
And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact,

267
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,260
because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.

268
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
This is the 21st century, right?

269
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,760
Pilleries and freak shows and public floggings,

270
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,060
these are barbaric practices from the dark ages, right?

271
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:11,160
Surely no one on the internet would ever entertain themselves

272
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,160
by humiliating people, right?

273
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,260
We've got maniacs.

274
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,760
We've got wackadoos.

275
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,760
We've got schizos, fatties, and spergs.

276
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,260
Come see sexual deviants on display.

277
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,260
That's right, folks.

278
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,760
We've got cackling perverts of every denomination.

279
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,260
Come see the panty sniffer.

280
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,760
He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings.

281
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,260
Come see the skeleton girl.

282
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
She hasn't had a bite in 30 days.

283
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,260
That's right, we've got real, live lesbians.

284
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
And I'll be your master of ceremonies.

285
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,260
Half man, half woman, all freak.

286
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:53,760
Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.

287
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,760
Welcome to the dark side of cringe.

288
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,260
Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture.

289
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:02,260
And by that I mean there's whole channels making content

290
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,760
that centers the experience of cringing.

291
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,760
And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content,

292
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,760
including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.

293
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,760
I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,

294
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,760
which was the heyday of the feminist cringe compilation,

295
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,260
or SJW cringe compilation.

296
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,260
Remember those?

297
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,760
This is ancient history by YouTube standards,

298
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,760
but in 2016, the word cringe was most associated

299
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,260
with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.

300
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,260
His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video,

301
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,760
which means he would play someone else's content,

302
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,760
then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is.

303
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,260
No makeup or some sweatpants.

304
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,760
Oh my god.

305
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
It's so fucking bad.

306
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,260
He looks like he's gender fluid.

307
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,260
He looks like a fucking lesbian.

308
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,260
This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,

309
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,260
and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts

310
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,760
and free-thinking tuxedos.

311
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,260
What even is this thing?

312
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,260
It must be one of the 76 genders.

313
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,260
I didn't realize retarded was a gender.

314
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,260
Sorry, my dudes.

315
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
You were on the cringe side of history.

316
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,760
Obviously, there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.

317
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,760
The logical antelope isn't inviting you to foster

318
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,260
a shared sense of humanity by recognizing your own weakness

319
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,260
in the embarrassment of screeching feminists.

320
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,260
No, this is an invitation to contempt.

321
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,260
Here's a YouTube video titled Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.

322
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,260
You'd expect from the title that it would be a video

323
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,760
of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways.

324
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,760
But it isn't.

325
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,760
It's literally just a compilation of fat people doing things.

326
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,260
This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.

327
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,760
Is this cringe?

328
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,260
What is cringe about it?

329
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,260
Earlier we defined cringe as either

330
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,760
vicarious embarrassment or contempt

331
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,760
for someone who lacks awareness about the way others are perceiving them.

332
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,260
But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there's no context,

333
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,760
so we don't know anything about her mental state.

334
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,760
And we certainly don't know whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.

335
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,760
If there is an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel

336
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,260
or if she tried to photoshop herself to look like a size 4,

337
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,260
okay, maybe that would be cringe.

338
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,260
But that's not what's going on in this clip.

339
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,260
She's just existing.

340
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
In water.

341
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:14,260
What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?

342
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:16,760
Presumably, something along the lines of

343
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,760
ew.

344
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Fat people.

345
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,760
Gross.

346
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,760
It's literally just disgust, right?

347
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,760
Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body.

348
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,260
Here's another cringe compilation,

349
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,260
this one titled

350
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:35,760
and we're watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their genderfluid identity.

351
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:39,260
Honestly, it's kind of terrifying because,

352
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,760
you know, like,

353
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,760
genderfluid people just aren't accepted.

354
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,260
Yeah, apparently not.

355
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:49,260
And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this in a cringe compilation,

356
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,760
it seems that the person in this video was dead on about how people would perceive them.

357
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,760
But despite that self-awareness,

358
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,760
we're being invited to cringe.

359
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,260
Because...

360
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:02,260
I guess being genderfluid, like being fat,

361
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,760
is cringe in and of itself.

362
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,260
Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.

363
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,760
This is not real cringe, I wanna say.

364
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:15,260
Cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others.

365
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,260
But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread

366
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,760
that there's really no point in objecting to it.

367
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,260
If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia,

368
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,

369
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:30,260
you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow,

370
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,260
a furry,

371
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,760
a couple bronies,

372
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,260
a fedora tipper.

373
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:38,760
These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts.

374
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,760
They're types of people who are white,

375
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,260
widely ridiculed online.

376
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:45,260
I'd like to share with you a list that I put together

377
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:48,260
of groups that are often considered to be cringe.

378
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:48,760
Bronies,

379
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,760
furries,

380
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:50,260
otaku,

381
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,260
weebs,

382
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:51,760
incels,

383
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:52,760
neckbeards,

384
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,760
fedora tippers,

385
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,760
gamers,

386
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,760
TikTok teens,

387
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,260
not-like-other-girls girls,

388
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,260
fanfic writers,

389
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,260
beat poets,

390
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,260
SJWs,

391
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:00,760
feminists,

392
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
magas,

393
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,760
trans people,

394
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
non-binary people,

395
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,760
trans trenders,

396
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,760
queer afab ukulele players,

397
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,760
autistic people,

398
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,760
fat people,

399
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,760
the mentally ill,

400
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,760
and the mentally disabled.

401
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,260
Now I'm searching for some thread that all these groups have in common,

402
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,760
and a handful of themes do jump out.

403
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,760
Deviancy,

404
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,260
whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.

405
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,760
A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.

406
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:26,760
The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.

407
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,760
Obsessive interests and unconventional hobbies.

408
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,260
Low social status.

409
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:34,260
It's pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days.

410
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,260
If you add up all the groups on this list,

411
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:39,260
I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.

412
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,760
It includes me three or four times.

413
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,760
I'm of course a fedora-tipping, queer, afab, ukulele-playing TikTok team.

414
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,760
Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe,

415
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,760
and try to be, like, compassionate or whatever?

416
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,260
Fuck no.

417
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,760
The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.

418
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,260
Oh no.

419
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:00,260
This is social reject battle royale.

420
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,260
Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way,

421
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,760
and I want to explore what the rewards might be.

422
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,760
Let's start by looking at the role of cringe in internet politics.

423
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,760
Where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.

424
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,760
At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,

425
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,760
you couldn't escape clips of this woman, known as Big Red,

426
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event

427
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,260
and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely.

428
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,260
It's part of patriarchy.

429
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,760
Part of patriarchy.

430
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,260
I don't know if you're noticing a theme.

431
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,260
Patriarchy.

432
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,260
I'm reading.

433
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
Fuckface.

434
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,260
Mr. Entitled.

435
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
Mr. Ego.

436
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,260
Patriarchy, fuckface.

437
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,760
She's one of these people who just

438
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,760
generates memeable phrases at an amazing rate.

439
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,760
I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,

440
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,760
but I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia.

441
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,760
Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,

442
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,760
reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays.

443
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:56,760
Often Big Red was framed as, like,

444
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,760
THE feminist, the mascot of feminism,

445
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,760
a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists.

446
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:07,760
Which is highly dishonest, considering she's not even a high-profile activist or thinker.

447
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,760
She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto.

448
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,760
But because of this amusing 12-minute video,

449
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:16,760
it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman,

450
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,760
who, we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form.

451
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,760
I call this strategy mascotization,

452
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,760
the construction of a strawman nemesis.

453
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,760
What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person

454
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,760
and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team.

455
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,760
It's very simple, but very effective.

456
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,760
And it's best paired with memification.

457
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,760
That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,

458
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,760
you freeze it,

459
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,760
and you declare that that moment fully represents a person.

460
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,760
Then, through mascotization,

461
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,760
you declare that this memified person represents an entire group or movement.

462
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:55,760
Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester,

463
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,760
You're fucking a white male!

464
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
memified as AIDS Skrillex,

465
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:00,760
and this protester,

466
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:05,760
Keep your hands clean! I'm a scoundrel! Keep your hands clean! I'm a scoundrel!

467
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,760
who was memified as Trigley Puff.

468
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,760
The two of them symbolized the wretchedness

469
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
of beta new male cuckoldry

470
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,760
and the hysteria of social justice cry bullies, respectively.

471
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,

472
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,760
about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.

473
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,

474
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,760
as like this fake gamer girl,

475
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,760
this pleb-tier casual,

476
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.

477
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,760
But other times it was almost a super villainous caricature,

478
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,760
this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype,

479
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,760
threatening to confiscate your video games

480
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,760
and engulf you in her yonic abyss.

481
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,760
Now it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as super villainous is effective.

482
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,760
Though it comes at the risk of backfiring

483
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,760
by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,

484
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,760
a little too badass.

485
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,760
But the subtler strategy of symbolizing your political enemies

486
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,760
not with an evil, but with a cringe-worthy mascot,

487
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:06,760
works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense, emotional way.

488
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:11,760
Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule.

489
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,760
And if someone has been made a laughingstock,

490
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,760
it's much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing

491
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,760
than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.

492
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,760
To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.

493
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,760
And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,

494
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:30,760
I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content

495
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,760
is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at.

496
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,760
When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,

497
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,760
laughing at someone and ridiculing them,

498
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,760
we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.

499
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,760
Don't act like that, or people will laugh at you.

500
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,760
This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior.

501
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:56,760
It's why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals.

502
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,760
You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory, at the whipping post.

503
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,760
You see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables.

504
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,760
And it sends a powerful message.

505
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,760
Don't do whatever that guy did.

506
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,760
I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact

507
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:15,760
that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it's the 17th century.

508
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,760
There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks.

509
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:22,760
But instead, there's teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos.

510
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,760
There's ex-boyfriends revenge posting their girlfriends' nudes.

511
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,760
There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone

512
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
for alleged breaches of wokeness.

513
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,760
Public humiliation is a powerful force.

514
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,760
And it's usually...

515
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
It's not a good force.

516
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,760
But there are some rare exceptions.

517
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,760
Back in the Gamergate era,

518
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,760
Gamergate itself, of course, being a study in public humiliation,

519
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,760
slut-shaming on a massive online scale,

520
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,760
YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism.

521
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,760
As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks,

522
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,760
and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers

523
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,760
who were constantly mobbed and harassed.

524
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,760
What I see is one of the turning points

525
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,760
in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days

526
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,760
to the left-tube world of today

527
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,760
was a handful of videos uploaded by then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis,

528
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,760
in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual

529
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,760
called Davis Aurini.

530
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,760
Come on, Davis, we have to...

531
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,760
No, stop lecturing me about ethics!

532
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
We have to get out of here!

533
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,760
And can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?!

534
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,760
In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate

535
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
about the wickedness of women

536
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
while posing in front of a toy skull

537
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.

538
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,760
Men of the West, women in our culture,

539
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,760
have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.

540
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,760
And so in discussing sluts versus whores,

541
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,760
I would start with the premise

542
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,760
that all women are whores.

543
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,760
Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views

544
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,760
and a fairly positive response

545
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,760
even from a mostly male gamer audience,

546
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,760
who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.

547
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,760
Why did these videos work with this audience

548
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
where so many others didn't?

549
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,760
Well, I think it's because

550
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,760
Harry didn't moralistically call out Davis

551
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,760
for being problematic or misogynistic.

552
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:21,760
Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact

553
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,760
that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.

554
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,760
And Davis was a perfect target

555
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:29,760
because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.

556
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,760
He had no self-awareness about the fact

557
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
that pretty much everyone saw,

558
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,760
through his absurd posturing,

559
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:36,760
as a badass tough guy by day,

560
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,760
profoundly dark philosopher by night.

561
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,760
We exist in a world with feminized legislation.

562
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
I've spoken to men and boys who've told me

563
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:46,760
that Harry's videos inspired

564
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,760
the beginning of a feminist awakening in them.

565
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
Not just because they cringed at Davis Arrheni,

566
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
but also because they recognized

567
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,760
a little bit of Davis in themselves.

568
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
And they cringed at that too.

569
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,760
Recognizing part of yourself

570
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,760
in a cringe-worthy person

571
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,760
induces self-cringe,

572
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,760
which can motivate you to change your behavior,

573
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,760
your beliefs,

574
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
or even your own self-concept.

575
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,760
And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance

576
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,760
of a recognizable stock character on the internet,

577
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,760
namely the Fedora Tipper.

578
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader

579
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,760
for traditional masculinity,

580
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,760
but who's basically just a pasty nerd

581
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,760
who can't relate to women.

582
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Davis was such an extreme version of this,

583
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,760
and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments

584
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,760
so frequently that I would classify him

585
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,760
as what the internet calls a lull cow.

586
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Lull cow is old 4chan lingo.

587
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,760
It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric

588
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,760
or foolish behavior can be milked for lulls.

589
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,760
Milking, in this context,

590
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,760
can mean simply watching a lull cow's behavior

591
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
and laughing at them,

592
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,760
or it can mean making reaction videos

593
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
where you make fun of them,

594
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,760
or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them

595
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,760
to get a response that you find entertaining.

596
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,760
I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,

597
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,760
or my old videos about the Golden One,

598
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,760
as lull cow milking content,

599
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,760
with a political angle.

600
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,760
It was essentially an argument from ridicule,

601
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
an argument from cringe,

602
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,760
with the aim of convincing people

603
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,760
don't embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs.

604
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,760
But also,

605
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
and I'll just speak for myself here,

606
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,760
I am, at the end of the day,

607
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,760
an entertainer.

608
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,760
And I wanted people to laugh.

609
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
There doesn't need to be a political agenda

610
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,760
behind milking lull cows.

611
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,760
In fact, usually, there isn't.

612
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,760
The purest example of a lull cow I can think of

613
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,760
is actually someone from way before the internet,

614
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
namely Florence Foster Jenkins.

615
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,760
Jenkins, or Lady Florence,

616
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,760
as she liked to be called,

617
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
was an American soprano

618
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
who attracted a cult following in New York City

619
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s

620
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,760
due to her being such a terrible singer

621
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
that people went to her concerts

622
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
essentially for the lulls.

623
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
She was described as

624
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
the world's worst opera singer.

625
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:57,760
No one,

626
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,760
before or since,

627
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,760
has succeeded in liberating themselves

628
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,760
quite so completely

629
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,760
from the shackles of musical notation.

630
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Behold this fucking camp queen.

631
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Oh, we have no choice but to stan.

632
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,760
Here's a short clip of one of the few recordings she made.

633
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Cringe.

634
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,760
She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,

635
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,760
the William Hung of her age.

636
00:27:22,760 --> 00:27:25,760
Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence

637
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
until 1944,

638
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,760
when she was 76 years old,

639
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert

640
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,760
to which newspaper critics showed up.

641
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:34,760
The next morning,

642
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,760
the New York Sun reported,

643
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,760
much of her singing was hopelessly lacking

644
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,760
in a semblance of pitch,

645
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,760
but the further a note was from its proper elevation,

646
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,760
the more the audience laughed and applauded.

647
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,760
And five days later,

648
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,760
she had a heart attack and died.

649
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
I find something very touching about this story.

650
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,760
I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone

651
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,760
if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,

652
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,760
but I feel so much better.

653
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,760
I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.

654
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,760
It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell,

655
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
at least he tries to stop these people

656
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,760
before things get out of hand.

657
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,760
I think it's normal to have mixed feelings about a lolcow.

658
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,760
Like, yes, this is hilarious,

659
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
but on the other hand,

660
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,760
doth not a lolcow bleed?

661
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,760
On some level we know it's wrong to entertain ourselves this way,

662
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
but on the other hand,

663
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,760
other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.

664
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,760
There's a good book about this called The Joy of Pain,

665
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:27,760
Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature,

666
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
by Richard Smith.

667
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Schadenfreude is, of course,

668
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
the pleasure we take in other people's misery,

669
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,760
and Smith argues that we experience it

670
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:35,760
because psychologically,

671
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,760
we gain something when other people lose.

672
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,760
We're constantly evaluating our own worth

673
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,760
by comparing ourselves to other people.

674
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,760
So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,

675
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,760
a pleasant feeling of superiority,

676
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,760
from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,

677
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,760
especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.

678
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,760
Maybe I'm not perfect,

679
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,760
but at least I'm not this lolcow.

680
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,760
And we also get a boost

681
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,760
when people who are socially above us,

682
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,760
whom we envy,

683
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,760
get brought down a peg.

684
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,760
James Charles' cancelled party,

685
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:09,760
LOLOL.

686
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,760
I think Schadenfreude basically accounts

687
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:16,760
for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com.

688
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Smith uses the word

689
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,760
for this type of media,

690
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,760
like reality TV shows

691
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,760
designed to produce spectacular moments

692
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:25,760
of embarrassment.

693
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,760
YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,

694
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,760
or some kind of carnival sideshow.

695
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,760
I mean, take a look around you.

696
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,760
We have Eugenia Cooney,

697
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,760
a YouTuber who, at the time I'm making this video,

698
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,760
remains apparently in total denial

699
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,760
about her eating disorder,

700
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,760
and continues to make videos

701
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,760
modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.

702
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
We have Wings of Redemption,

703
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,760
a bad-tempered gamer who,

704
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
for a long time,

705
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,760
was essentially confined by poverty,

706
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:50,760
obesity, and depression

707
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,760
to streaming video games all day

708
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
to an audience of trolls

709
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,760
that enjoyed tormenting him.

710
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
We have Onision,

711
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
a habitual

712
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
ALLENGE

713
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,760
abuser of women and teenage girls,

714
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,760
who earlier this year

715
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,760
essentially performed his own mental breakdown

716
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
on YouTube

717
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
after Patreon banned him

718
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
for doxxing an accuser.

719
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:11,760
I love kombucha!

720
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,760
Whose idea was it

721
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,760
to give hundreds of pathological narcissists

722
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
access to video equipment?

723
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,760
What kind of sick social experiment

724
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
are we living in?

725
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
And the viewers

726
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,760
are no better than the performers.

727
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs

728
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
makes me sick.

729
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,760
Oh, you people love nothing more

730
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,760
than to watch one of us poor,

731
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,760
helpless egomaniacs

732
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
completely lose our minds

733
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:36,760
live on camera.

734
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
Is this what you want, huh?

735
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,760
Is this what-

736
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:42,760
You wanna total meltdown?

737
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
You know, as a creator,

738
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,760
you have to be aware that

739
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,760
you're a circus performer,

740
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
and the crowd may in fact

741
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:50,760
be more entertained

742
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
if you fall from the trapeze

743
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
and get eaten by the tigers.

744
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,760
Online media today

745
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,760
is full of Lady Florences,

746
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,760
anti-celebrities with anti-fans.

747
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,760
Now, to be clear,

748
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,760
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong

749
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
with indulging now and then

750
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,760
in a little bit of light contempt.

751
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:07,760
Cringing at Davis Aurini

752
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,760
or bad American Idol auditions

753
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:10,760
seems pretty harmless,

754
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,760
but it can be taken too far.

755
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:14,760
And there's no better case study

756
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
of taking it too far

757
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
than the cult following

758
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,760
of one Christine Weston Chandler.

759
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
If you don't know what's coming,

760
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,760
you might want to strap in, Gorge,

761
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,760
because this is coconuts.

762
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
It's bananas.

763
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:28,760
It's a full fruit salad.

764
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,760
God, how do I even begin to explain this?

765
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Well, Christine Weston Chandler,

766
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
more commonly known on the internet

767
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,760
as Chris-Chan,

768
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,760
is the victim

769
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,760
of what is quite possibly

770
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
the longest-running

771
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,760
and most obsessive

772
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,760
internet trolling saga of all time.

773
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,760
She's the lolcow of lols.

774
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Hello, everybody.

775
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,760
This is Christine Chandler

776
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,760
coming to you live from home once again.

777
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Chandler is an autistic trans woman.

778
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,760
And yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,

779
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
which I pause to explain

780
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
because I don't think I've ever seen anyone

781
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
actually take her transition seriously.

782
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,760
Most people seem to regard it as

783
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,760
simply another absurd symptom

784
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,760
of her hilarious mental condition.

785
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:12,760
In fact, a bunch of trans people

786
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:14,760
will probably get real salty with me

787
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,760
for making trans people look bad

788
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
by including Chris-Chan in our Oats.

789
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club.

790
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
Oh, please.

791
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty.

792
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,760
This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.

793
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,760
God, how did trannies get so snobbish?

794
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,760
Look, is Chris-Chan really trans?

795
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
I don't know.

796
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,760
And I don't care.

797
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman,

798
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
I for one support her journey.

799
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
But it doesn't matter.

800
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
The relevant thing about Chris-Chan

801
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:48,760
is not Chris-Chan.

802
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,760
It's the fact that for the last 13 years,

803
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,760
nearly every aspect of her life

804
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,760
has been obsessively archived online

805
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:00,760
by thousands of voyeurs known as Chris-storians.

806
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,760
Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom

807
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,760
several internet centuries ago,

808
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,760
back in 2007,

809
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,760
when 4chan took notice of her comic book series Sonichu,

810
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:14,760
a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu.

811
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,760
The comic is set in Quickville, CWC,

812
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
being Chris-Chan's initials.

813
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
The protagonist is a self-insert

814
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,760
who references Chandler's real-life

815
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
quote,

816
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,760
love quest

817
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,760
to find a quote,

818
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
boyfriend-free girl,

819
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
which apparently involved posting bizarre

820
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,760
attraction signs

821
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,760
around her community college.

822
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,760
For this story to make sense,

823
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,760
you have to keep in mind

824
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,760
that Chandler identified and presented as male

825
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
until 2015.

826
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,760
So these trolls saw her as like

827
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:45,760
the ultimate autistic incel man-child.

828
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,760
Just to give you a feel for this,

829
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,760
here's Christine in 2018

830
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,760
holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait.

831
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Note the Sonichu medallions.

832
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:55,760
Here's the bedroom she lived in,

833
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,760
and here she is in recent years

834
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,760
giving us a full Bronycon eleganza.

835
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Pegasister snapped.

836
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Basically she's the entire cringetopia subreddit

837
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
condensed into a single person.

838
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,760
So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit,

839
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,760
cause of course they did,

840
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
and they began tormenting her

841
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,760
by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,

842
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,760
posting candid photos of her,

843
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
etc.

844
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,760
Chandler reacted to the trolls,

845
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,760
which of course encouraged them more,

846
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,760
and the harassment escalated and escalated.

847
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,760
They hacked her accounts,

848
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,760
or tricked her into giving out passwords,

849
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,760
they posted all her emails online,

850
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,760
they showed up in person and photographed her house,

851
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,760
they called her parents,

852
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,760
posing as friends,

853
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,760
psychiatrists,

854
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,760
journalists,

855
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,760
employers,

856
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
in order to extract as much information

857
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,760
about her as possible.

858
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,760
And of course they contacted Chandler herself,

859
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,760
which was very rewarding for trolls,

860
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
because she has no filter,

861
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,760
and was very naive and trusting.

862
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,760
So she was very willing to divulge,

863
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,760
or easily manipulated into divulging,

864
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,760
mortifying information about herself.

865
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,760
Sexual, psychological,

866
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,760
scatological,

867
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,760
there's not really any limits or boundaries to this.

868
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
For all the information they gathered,

869
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,760
the trolls created a wiki,

870
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,760
called the Quickie,

871
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
devoted to the obsessive compiling

872
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
of all Chris Chan data.

873
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,760
It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,

874
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,760
entire articles about all members of her immediate and extended family,

875
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:22,760
pages of psychiatric records she was tricked into sending them,

876
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,760
and that's only the beginning.

877
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,760
In their more grandiose moods,

878
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
the Chris-torians have speculated

879
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,760
that Chris Chan is the most documented life

880
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,760
in all human history,

881
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,760
comparing their social expair-tainment

882
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,760
to the Truman Show.

883
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,760
It's a level of obsession

884
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,760
that surpasses the wildest excesses of Stan culture.

885
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,760
It's a gaze into the abyss

886
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,760
that does not blink.

887
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,760
Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,

888
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,760
or on one occasion, sex workers,

889
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,760
to the Chandler household.

890
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates with Chris Chan,

891
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,760
of course secretly wearing wires to record their conversations.

892
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends

893
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,760
so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.

894
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760
These things must be awful.

895
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
They're archived, don't you understand?

896
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,760
Chris Chan must be documented.

897
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,760
The absolute low point came

898
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,760
when some trolls encouraged a 13-year-old boy

899
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,760
to pose as a 19-year-old girl

900
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,760
and have phone sex with Chris Chan and record it.

901
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,760
In other words,

902
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
they groomed a child

903
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,760
to deceive an autistic person

904
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,760
into performing sex acts for their entertainment.

905
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,760
Now, to contemporary Chris-torians,

906
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,760
this sort of sadistic interference

907
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,760
in Christine's life is frowned upon.

908
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Not so much because it's immoral,

909
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:49,760
so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,

910
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,760
a bit attention-seeking.

911
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,760
No, to the sophisticated Chris-torian,

912
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
the real pleasure in all this

913
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,760
is supposed to lie in quietly spectating,

914
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,760
savoring the fine notes of cringe.

915
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,760
Now, I take it I don't even need to comment

916
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,760
on the morality of all this.

917
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:11,760
The real question to me is why?

918
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,760
Why do thousands of people

919
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:17,760
have a morbid obsession with Christine Chandler?

920
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,760
And yes, it is an obsession.

921
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,760
Just to give you a sense of a single individual's

922
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
personal investment in this,

923
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,760
the YouTuber Gino Samuel,

924
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
one of very few Chris-torians

925
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
with the audacity to show his face,

926
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,760
has been working for more than two years

927
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:37,760
to produce an eventual 100-episode documentary series

928
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,760
about the life of Chris Chan.

929
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,760
Gino has completed 36 episodes

930
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,760
so far, and each episode is around 40 minutes long,

931
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,760
meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video

932
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,760
about the life of what is essentially

933
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,760
a random stranger.

934
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:55,760
I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.

935
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,760
I'll call it morbid cringe,

936
00:37:57,760 --> 00:37:59,760
defined as an obsessive and addictive

937
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
contemptuous fascination

938
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,760
with a particular person or group.

939
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,760
Why does morbid cringe happen?

940
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Well, I've spent some time

941
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,760
poring over Chris-torians' conversations

942
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,760
with each other,

943
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,760
and I've even interrogated a couple of them,

944
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
and this is what I've found.

945
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,760
The first thing they'll tell you is that

946
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,760
they just think it's funny and entertaining,

947
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
that Christine's strange life and mind

948
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,760
simply appeals to their morbid curiosity.

949
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,760
And I'm sure that's true.

950
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,760
But a lot of things are funny and entertaining

951
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,760
and morbidly interesting.

952
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Why fixate on this particular person?

953
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,760
Well, for a lot of them, it's a reassurance

954
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,760
that there's someone out there

955
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,760
worse than them.

956
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,760
Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,

957
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,760
but at least this defenseless punching bag

958
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,760
called Chris-Chan is here for them

959
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,760
to assert their superiority over.

960
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,760
It's pretty much common knowledge

961
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,760
that a lot of Chris-torians,

962
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,760
including some of the most vocal haters,

963
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,760
are autistic themselves.

964
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,760
And a frequent justification

965
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,760
given for trolling Chris-Chan

966
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:06,760
is that she's giving autistics a bad name.

967
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,760
In recent years, there's also been

968
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,760
a small contingent of transgender trolls

969
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
who are likewise prone to say,

970
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,760
he's not a real transgender like me

971
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,760
and he's making us all look bad.

972
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,760
Oh yeah, cause people who troll Chris-Chan?

973
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,760
You guys look amazing.

974
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,760
It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this

975
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,760
about why trolling Chandler is justified,

976
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,760
righteous even.

977
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,760
Because, at the end of the day,

978
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,760
trolls are people too.

979
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,760
And a lot of them actually do have

980
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
a guilty conscience about this,

981
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,760
which they suppress by insisting

982
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,760
that Chris-Chan is a horrible person

983
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
who deserves to be tormented.

984
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
But trolls who protest too much

985
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,760
about the evils of Chris-Chan,

986
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,760
and therefore reveal the excess

987
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:00,760
of their emotional investment in this,

988
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,760
are known in the community as A-logs.

989
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
A-log is the name of a troll

990
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,760
who attracted the eyes of people

991
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,760
who are aware of other trolls

992
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,760
by ranting about Chris-Chan's crimes,

993
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:14,760
comparing her to Hitler,

994
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:18,760
and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.

995
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:19,760
Among the trolls,

996
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,760
this kind of behavior is considered

997
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,760
an embarrassment to all of them

998
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
because they want to feel

999
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,760
like they're just coolly and casually

1000
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
toying with this person.

1001
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,760
You know, just for laughs.

1002
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
Not a big deal.

1003
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
Perfectly healthy,

1004
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
and normal,

1005
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,760
and fine.

1006
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,760
It's fine.

1007
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,760
But A-log gave the lie to that illusion

1008
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,760
because it was obvious that his Chris-Chan obsession

1009
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
wasn't healthy,

1010
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
or normal,

1011
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,760
or fine.

1012
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
So the other trolls turned on A-log,

1013
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,760
and they made him into Chris-Chan 2.0,

1014
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,760
and they uncovered his autism,

1015
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,760
and his furry porn collection,

1016
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:04,760
and his cringy erotic fanfiction.

1017
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:09,760
So why would someone as similar to Chris-Chan as A-log

1018
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
obsessively hate on her?

1019
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
Well, there's two explanations.

1020
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
One is troll-shielding.

1021
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,760
That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris-Chan

1022
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
and spearheaded the trolling efforts

1023
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
in order to protect himself

1024
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,760
from being targeted by trolls.

1025
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,760
The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob

1026
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,760
by waving your pitchfork the hardest.

1027
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
Obviously, this did not work.

1028
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
The other explanation is that,

1029
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,760
A-log saw himself reflected in Chris-Chan,

1030
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,760
and sort of projected his own shame

1031
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:45,760
and self-contempt onto her.

1032
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
A-log hated Chris-Chan

1033
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
because he saw part of himself in her.

1034
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,760
And the other trolls hated A-log

1035
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,760
because they saw part of themselves in him.

1036
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
To quote Margaret Pless,

1037
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,760
who covered this story for New York Magazine

1038
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,760
a few years ago,

1039
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,760
I think it might be A-log's all the way down.

1040
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:05,760
People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-Chan,

1041
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,760
because to them she's a symbol

1042
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,760
of something they hate about themselves,

1043
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,760
something they're ashamed of.

1044
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum,

1045
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,760
or being a socially awkward recluse.

1046
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents,

1047
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:22,760
or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons,

1048
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,760
or embarrassing sexual proclivities,

1049
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:27,760
or all of the above.

1050
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,760
This is how scapegoating works, right?

1051
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:32,760
You repress your uncomfortable feelings

1052
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,760
of shame and insecurity and self-loathing.

1053
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,760
And you displace them onto someone else,

1054
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,760
usually someone you can feel superior to.

1055
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,760
Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat,

1056
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,760
transforming your painful shame and self-loathing

1057
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,760
into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.

1058
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,760
It's pretty safe to assume

1059
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:56,760
that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls

1060
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:58,760
are some kind of social outcasts,

1061
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:00,760
much like Chris-Chan.

1062
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:04,760
So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris-Chan

1063
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,760
is a way of processing the shame and anxiety

1064
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,760
of social rejection and exclusion.

1065
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,760
And I think for a lot of people, even normal people,

1066
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,760
who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,

1067
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,760
contemptuous cringing helps us cope

1068
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:20,760
with our own shame and insecurity.

1069
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:22,760
Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious

1070
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,760
empathizing with other people

1071
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:27,760
and find a way to make this all about me.

1072
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:58,760
.

1073
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:59,760
Meow meow.

1074
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,760
Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend?

1075
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:03,760
Would you like to meet my...

1076
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:04,760
.

1077
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,760
boyfriend's boyfriend?

1078
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,760
That's right, honey,

1079
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,760
I'm giving you fujoshi realness, nya.

1080
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,760
He's gonna stay right here as a grim reminder

1081
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,760
of the things that you have seen.

1082
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,760
Actually, I identify as a trap.

1083
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:15,760
It's very that.

1084
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,760
I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.

1085
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,760
Cringe is failed seriousness.

1086
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:21,760
In my last video,

1087
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,760
I talked about how ashamed I am

1088
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:25,760
of being a transgender lesbian.

1089
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Cringe.

1090
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:27,760
Shame.

1091
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:28,760
At the end of that video,

1092
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,760
I talk about how I sense that my shame

1093
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,760
is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel

1094
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
for a lot of other trans lesbians,

1095
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,760
particularly those of the heckin' stripey sock,

1096
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:39,760
nya nya, catgirl variety.

1097
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,760
But I confess to periodically sinking

1098
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:45,760
into these morbid, guilty binges

1099
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,760
of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.

1100
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,760
I want to return to that thought

1101
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,760
and kind of psychoanalyze myself

1102
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,760
as a kind of first-person case study

1103
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
of a morbid cringe obsession.

1104
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,760
So, uh, catgirl trans girls are...

1105
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,760
Okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.

1106
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:05,760
They're trans women, usually attracted to women,

1107
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,760
who express their identity online

1108
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:13,760
through cloying, neotenous, otaku memery.

1109
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,760
And my conscious reason for cringing at them

1110
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,760
is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls

1111
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:21,760
as a kind of visual baby talk,

1112
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,760
an infantilized and unrealistic representation

1113
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,760
of femininity and womanhood

1114
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,760
that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.

1115
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,760
So when trans women identify with it,

1116
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,760
I cringe.

1117
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:33,760
Like, no.

1118
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,760
You can't become an anime girl, Lily.

1119
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,760
Fuck your dreams.

1120
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,760
Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked

1121
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
with a discussion of whether my opinions

1122
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,760
about catgirls are fair or correct.

1123
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:46,760
So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.

1124
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,760
Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.

1125
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,760
Listen to the contempt beneath my words.

1126
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:55,760
Because even if everything I'm saying is true,

1127
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:58,760
catgirls are being cringe online

1128
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,760
is a situation so inconsequential

1129
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:04,760
that any amount of emotional energy spent on it

1130
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,760
is too much.

1131
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,760
So why do I have this cringe fixation?

1132
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:12,760
Well, according to the A-log theory of morbid cringing,

1133
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,760
we form obsessive and addictive contempt

1134
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:17,760
for people who have traits in common with us,

1135
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,760
people who make us uncomfortable

1136
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:22,760
because we see something of ourselves in them.

1137
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,760
So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?

1138
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,760
Well, we're both trans women,

1139
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,760
we're both attracted to women,

1140
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,760
uh, I do like anime, but

1141
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,760
I don't like the anime they like, okay?

1142
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,760
I like good anime that has, you know,

1143
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,760
mature, three-dimensional female characters.

1144
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:43,760
Look, I'm a real transgender, okay?

1145
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
I'm not like you.

1146
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,760
It's also not lost on me that this is like

1147
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:47,760
the seventh time on this channel

1148
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,760
I've dressed as a catgirl

1149
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:51,760
to make fun of them.

1150
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,760
I have posted cringe.

1151
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,760
You should all be laughing at me right now.

1152
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:00,760
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.

1153
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,760
So I do think there's some truth to the idea

1154
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,760
that I'm A-logging these catgirls.

1155
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,760
I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.

1156
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:10,760
Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe

1157
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,760
at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,

1158
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,760
because of how these catgirls are acting.

1159
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,760
So let's make another distinction between

1160
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,760
in-group cringe and out-group cringe.

1161
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,760
In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone

1162
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:23,760
who belongs to the same group identity as you.

1163
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,760
For example, your family, your romantic partnership,

1164
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,760
your ethnicity, or your country.

1165
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Particularly if they're embarrassing themselves

1166
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,760
in front of outsiders to the group.

1167
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,760
Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets

1168
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,760
if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends.

1169
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,760
Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get

1170
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,760
when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump

1171
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,760
being our president.

1172
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,760
Or think about these phrases.

1173
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,760
She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.

1174
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:50,760
They're making trans people look bad.

1175
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:52,760
He's giving autistics a bad name.

1176
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,760
When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,

1177
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,760
we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment,

1178
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:00,760
we feel embarrassment,

1179
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:03,760
because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too.

1180
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,760
So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,

1181
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,760
because you're cringing at your membership

1182
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,760
in an embarrassing group.

1183
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
Nothing has ever triggered this kind of

1184
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,760
in-group embarrassment more for me

1185
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,760
than a cringe video that went viral last year,

1186
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:21,760
in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum

1187
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:23,760
over being misgendered in a GameStop.

1188
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,760
You're not getting my fucking money back!

1189
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,760
Excuse me sir, there's a young man in here.

1190
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,760
Excuse me, it's ma'am.

1191
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,760
It is ma'am!

1192
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,760
This video is excruciating for me to watch.

1193
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,760
Motherfucker, take it outside!

1194
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,760
If you want to call me sir again,

1195
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,760
I will show you a fucking sir!

1196
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,760
Motherfucker!

1197
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,760
The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly

1198
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,760
intimidate people into seeing you as a woman.

1199
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,760
Now Twitter's gonna come for me over this and say,

1200
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:56,760
Natalie hates trans women, hey don't pass!

1201
00:48:56,760 --> 00:48:59,760
But passing is really not what this is about.

1202
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,760
It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior

1203
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:07,760
from a trans woman, accompanied by apparently

1204
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,760
total delusion about how she's presenting.

1205
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,760
Well I'm gonna ask you for the fifth time

1206
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,760
to stop calling me a man!

1207
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:16,760
Because quite clearly I am not!

1208
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,760
It's really not that clear, Gorge.

1209
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,760
And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?

1210
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:23,760
The incongruity between her thinking that

1211
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,760
she's serving women, while

1212
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:28,760
bellowing like a drill sergeant.

1213
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,760
By the way, what I'm doing right now,

1214
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:31,760
this is cringe reaction content.

1215
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:33,760
I don't really do that on this channel, but

1216
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,760
I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.

1217
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:37,760
And it feels good. Like,

1218
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
intoxicatingly good.

1219
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,760
I can see how you could get addicted to this.

1220
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,760
I'm imagining myself right now,

1221
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,760
surrounded by cis people,

1222
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,760
and I am leading the righteous mob

1223
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,760
as we point and laugh

1224
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,760
at some delusional, manly dump truck.

1225
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,760
I am a real transgender.

1226
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:55,760
A true transgender.

1227
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,760
A good transgender.

1228
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,760
Father finally approves of me.

1229
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,760
Uh, this would be the unconscious, archetypal father.

1230
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,760
Jot that down in my progress notes please, Doctor.

1231
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:06,760
Okay, so why does this feel so good?

1232
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,760
Well, let me talk you through my feelings.

1233
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,760
When I watched that GameStop video,

1234
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,760
for the first few seconds,

1235
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,760
I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.

1236
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,760
I can even relate, cause in the first couple months

1237
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,760
of my transition, there was an occasion

1238
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,760
where I was in a lengthy

1239
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,760
customer service interaction

1240
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,760
where the guy at the desk was

1241
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,760
calling me sir the entire time.

1242
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:28,760
And there's something very humiliating

1243
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,760
about trying to present female,

1244
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,760
like wearing a dress and makeup,

1245
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,760
and yet being called sir.

1246
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,760
It's a quintessential mismatch between

1247
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:38,760
self-concept and the way other people are seeing you.

1248
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:40,760
And the memory of it is painful to me,

1249
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:42,760
but what I cling to

1250
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:44,760
is that while I may have

1251
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:46,760
looked like a man, at least

1252
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,760
I didn't act like a man.

1253
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:50,760
I didn't threaten to take anyone outside

1254
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,760
and show them a sir.

1255
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,760
In fact, I was too ashamed to even

1256
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,760
correct the guy.

1257
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,760
So as the GameStop video progresses,

1258
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:00,760
my sympathy runs out fast.

1259
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,760
And instead of compassionate cringe,

1260
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,760
I feel group embarrassment for trans women,

1261
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,760
including myself.

1262
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:08,760
And I feel contempt toward this individual

1263
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:10,760
for making us all look bad.

1264
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:12,760
I also feel a kind of morbid

1265
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:14,760
fascination rooted in fear.

1266
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:16,760
What if I'm as delusional as

1267
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:18,760
that trans woman?

1268
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,760
I don't look and sound like that, do I?

1269
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:22,760
I feel like I have to do a sanity check.

1270
00:51:22,760 --> 00:51:24,760
I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,

1271
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,760
because of my voice, just to make sure.

1272
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:28,760
And that fear motivates me to distance

1273
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,760
myself from that person in the video.

1274
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:32,760
I don't feel compassion for her,

1275
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:34,760
because that would mean putting myself

1276
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,760
in her size 16 shoes.

1277
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,760
And I don't want to do that,

1278
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
because I'm horrified and repulsed

1279
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,760
by the thought that I'm like her in some way.

1280
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:44,760
So I want to push away.

1281
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,760
And contempt is a way of emotionally

1282
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,760
distancing myself.

1283
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:50,760
And if I express that contempt by publicly

1284
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:52,760
shaming and condemning her,

1285
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,760
then I'm also socially distancing myself.

1286
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:56,760
Oops. Guess it's, uh,

1287
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,760
contagious.

1288
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,760
I think many people who are stigmatized

1289
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,760
or who have been humiliated

1290
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:04,760
long for the experience

1291
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,760
of being a normal, surrounded

1292
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,760
by fellow normals, judging

1293
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:10,760
and humiliating a freak.

1294
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,760
And if you take a look around trans YouTube,

1295
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:14,760
a lot of the biggest creators in the

1296
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:16,760
platform have channels

1297
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:18,760
basically devoted to exactly

1298
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:20,760
this type of cringe reaction

1299
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:22,760
humilitainment. The YouTuber

1300
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,760
Calvin Guerra is a trans guy whose best

1301
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:26,760
known for what are essentially cringe

1302
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,760
reaction videos, mostly aimed at

1303
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:30,760
people he deems trans-trenders.

1304
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:32,760
That is, people who claim to be

1305
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,760
trans, but who aren't real

1306
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,760
transgenders like Calvin.

1307
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,760
He's especially bothered by girly,

1308
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,760
afab, trans and non-binary

1309
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:42,760
teenagers, or by anyone who

1310
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,760
blurs the line between lesbian

1311
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,760
and transmasculine identities.

1312
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,760
Sometimes he'll do a long-form reaction to a

1313
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:50,760
specific person who grinds his gears.

1314
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,760
So this person is an asexual,

1315
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
non-binary,

1316
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,760
transgender,

1317
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,760
lesbian, who uses he,

1318
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,760
they, it, thons

1319
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,760
pronouns. According to my calculations,

1320
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,760
you are a trans-trender.

1321
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,760
In other times, he'll basically

1322
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,760
just laugh at cringy trans TikTok

1323
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,760
teens.

1324
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,760
No, no, I'm

1325
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,760
turning off the video. I can't watch

1326
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:16,760
this. He has a couple justifications

1327
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,760
for making these videos. One is that he's

1328
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:20,760
actually helping the people he's cringing at,

1329
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,760
because if a trender transitions,

1330
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,760
then they'll get dysphoria and have to detrend.

1331
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,760
But I have to wonder,

1332
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,760
does humiliating or laughing at people

1333
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,760
really help them figure out whether they're trans

1334
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,760
or not? His other justification is that

1335
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,760
trans-trenders are giving real trans

1336
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,760
people a bad name. They're the reason

1337
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,760
people are transphobic. This is why

1338
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,760
they hate us. It's because of

1339
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,760
the trenders. Wow, I love

1340
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,760
that idea of a true scum furry.

1341
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:46,760
Isn't that just, isn't that just

1342
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,760
wonderful? A true scum furry!

1343
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,760
Uh, but it's not, though.

1344
00:53:50,760 --> 00:53:52,760
I mean, transphobia existed

1345
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,760
long before there were people you could plausibly

1346
00:53:54,760 --> 00:53:56,760
describe as trans-trenders.

1347
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:58,760
So trans-trenders aren't the reason

1348
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:00,760
society hates trans people, Calvin.

1349
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:02,760
They're the reason you hate trans people, right?

1350
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,760
Or at least the trans community. And I feel like

1351
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,760
what you're doing is you're projecting that feeling onto

1352
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,760
society at large, and you're saying,

1353
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:10,760
oh, this is the reason people are transphobic.

1354
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,760
And to be fair, I get that it's not

1355
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,760
just a projection. Like, back in

1356
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,760
2016, the SJW cringe era,

1357
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:18,760
it was cis people mocking

1358
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,760
trans people with all these tropes.

1359
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:22,760
Attack helicopter, two genders,

1360
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,760
36 genders, special snowflakes.

1361
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:26,760
But now, they're used by trans people

1362
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,760
trying to distance themselves,

1363
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:30,760
trying to ghettoize the most laughed at

1364
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:32,760
people in the community under the label of

1365
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:34,760
trans-trenders. And Calvin, there may

1366
00:54:34,760 --> 00:54:36,760
be some truth to what you're saying about there being

1367
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:38,760
confused teenagers who think they're trans when

1368
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:40,760
they're not. I mean, I wouldn't know. I'm a

1369
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,760
near-dead woman in the twilight of my life, and I don't

1370
00:54:42,760 --> 00:54:44,760
hang out with teenagers. But even if it is true,

1371
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:46,760
Calvin, your fixation

1372
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:48,760
on it seems disproportionate to me.

1373
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,760
Like, you return to this topic to cringe

1374
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,760
again and again and again

1375
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:54,760
and again and again and again. It's like you're

1376
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,760
picking at a wound. It feels to me

1377
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,760
like a morbid cringe obsession.

1378
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,760
And I guess I think I recognize

1379
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,760
part of myself in you. This could be

1380
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,760
me projecting, of course, but I

1381
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,760
wonder if the way you feel about

1382
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,760
girly, sparkle-gender AFABs

1383
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,760
is similar to the way I feel about

1384
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:12,760
otaku, transbian catgirls.

1385
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,760
And it might be worth considering

1386
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,760
that I don't cringe at the

1387
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:18,760
sparkle genders the way you do. I mean, I'm

1388
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,760
with you on wondering what a hey-they-zeer

1389
00:55:20,760 --> 00:55:22,760
gender-flux lesbian demi-boy

1390
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:24,760
is. But unlike you, Calvin,

1391
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,760
I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession

1392
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,760
with feminine AFAB trans people.

1393
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:30,760
They can identify as however many genders

1394
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,760
they want for all I care. I may not always

1395
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,760
understand it, but I support

1396
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,760
their journey. I guess it doesn't bother

1397
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:38,760
me, because I'm not worried that anyone

1398
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:40,760
will judge me because of how they

1399
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,760
behave. I don't feel in-group cringe.

1400
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,760
Now it's a different story if I'm reading

1401
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,760
a general lesbian subreddit and I

1402
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,760
see a comment like,

1403
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,760
Pre-transition trans lesbian here.

1404
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,760
I wish I had titties. Girl,

1405
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,760
dick, nyah-nyah. Get the fuck out of here,

1406
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:56,760
Billy. You're giving real trans

1407
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,760
lesbians a bad name. This is why they

1408
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,760
hate us. See, now I

1409
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,760
have strong feelings. Now

1410
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:04,760
I'm in-group cringing. And intellectually,

1411
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:06,760
I do think my feelings are

1412
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:08,760
correct to some extent.

1413
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,760
Like, I don't think a general lesbian

1414
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,760
community is the appropriate

1415
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,760
forum for a trans woman who's

1416
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,760
effectively still living as a man

1417
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,760
to take the mic and whine about

1418
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,760
wanting titties or rhapsodize

1419
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:22,760
about girl dick. But I'm also

1420
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,760
aware that I feel this strongly

1421
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:26,760
about this because of my own

1422
00:56:26,760 --> 00:56:28,760
dysphoria. And my own shame.

1423
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,760
And honestly, my own

1424
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,760
self-loathing. Like, I can't

1425
00:56:32,760 --> 00:56:34,760
even talk to cis women on dating

1426
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:36,760
apps because I feel like a fake woman

1427
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,760
imposing myself on real women.

1428
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,760
That's where my head is at. So

1429
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,760
where does this pre-transition

1430
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:44,760
trans lesbian get the

1431
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,760
audacity? You know, it makes me feel in-group

1432
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,760
cringe about an identity,

1433
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,760
trans lesbianism, which for me

1434
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,760
is already a pain point of

1435
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:54,760
insecurity and embarrassment

1436
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,760
and shame. So Calvin, maybe

1437
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,760
and again, I could just be projecting,

1438
00:56:58,760 --> 00:57:00,760
but maybe, that's

1439
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,760
kind of like how you feel about these trenders.

1440
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,760
When you make these videos condemning

1441
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,760
them as not really trans, aren't

1442
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,760
you essentially exiling them from

1443
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,760
the in-group so you no longer feel

1444
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,760
the pain of in-group cringe?

1445
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:14,760
Or perhaps, Calvin Guerra,

1446
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,760
what you're really trying

1447
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:18,760
to destroy is the trender

1448
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:20,760
within.

1449
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:22,760
And again, I could be

1450
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:24,760
full of shit here. At the end of the day,

1451
00:57:24,760 --> 00:57:26,760
this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber

1452
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:28,760
I haven't met. So feel free

1453
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,760
to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin.

1454
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,760
But still, I guess I invite

1455
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,760
you to consider whether

1456
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:36,760
producing trans trender

1457
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,760
humilatainment is actually helping anything,

1458
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,760
or whether it's really

1459
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,760
just an addictive way to

1460
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,760
scratch some kind of emotional itch.

1461
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,760
Alright, I've said my piece about Calvin.

1462
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:48,760
Who's next?

1463
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,760
Oh, how about

1464
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,760
Vanessa. We meet again here.

1465
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,760
And once again, I'm wearing some

1466
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,760
kind of embarrassing anime hairpiece.

1467
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:58,760
Vanessa is a trans woman who

1468
00:57:58,760 --> 00:58:00,760
is the second most popular

1469
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:02,760
political trans YouTuber.

1470
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,760
At least that's what I wrote in the script when I

1471
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:06,760
had more subscribers than her and was fully

1472
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,760
prepared to be a cunt about it, but

1473
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,760
since then, she has

1474
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,760
in fact surpassed me once again.

1475
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,760
Good for her. Vanessa started out as

1476
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:16,760
basically a cringe reaction channel

1477
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,760
back when SJW cringe was fashionable.

1478
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:20,760
She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,

1479
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,760
but the most consistent theme was

1480
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:24,760
trans trenders and crazy activists

1481
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:26,760
are giving real trans people a bad name.

1482
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,760
They're making us look bad.

1483
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:30,760
This is why people hate us.

1484
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,760
So what we can now recognize as a standard

1485
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,760
in-group cringe fixation.

1486
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,760
But Vanessa focused in particular

1487
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,760
on a strident

1488
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,760
SJW type trans woman

1489
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,760
called Riley Dennis.

1490
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:44,760
And Vanessa made several reaction

1491
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,760
videos to her where she made a point

1492
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,760
of misgendering Riley and

1493
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:50,760
dismissing her as a fake

1494
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,760
transgender who hadn't

1495
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,760
transitioned and clearly

1496
00:58:54,760 --> 00:58:56,760
had no intention to.

1497
00:58:56,760 --> 00:58:58,760
You know, if you went on estrogen,

1498
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,760
your sex drive wouldn't be so high and you

1499
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,760
wouldn't be guilt tripping people into having sex with you.

1500
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:04,760
Just saying.

1501
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:06,760
But then, Riley made a video

1502
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,760
revealing that she'd been on hormone therapy

1503
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,760
for a year and was about to

1504
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:12,760
undergo facial feminization surgery.

1505
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:14,760
This prompted Vanessa

1506
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:16,760
to make an apology video where she

1507
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,760
not only apologized to Riley

1508
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:20,760
and acknowledged her transition, but she

1509
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,760
actually went beyond the script of a

1510
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:24,760
generic oopsie doopsie YouTube video

1511
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:26,760
and opened up about having

1512
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,760
experienced herself the cruelty

1513
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:30,760
she directed at Riley.

1514
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,760
I'm someone who's had my transition

1515
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:34,760
picked apart online.

1516
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:36,760
There have been Reddit threads and 4chan

1517
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,760
threads with hundreds of comments on it

1518
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:40,760
of people trying to prove that I'm not trans

1519
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,760
because I haven't done this or that

1520
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:44,760
or, you know, digging up my old pictures

1521
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,760
and so the thought that this entire

1522
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,760
time I've done that exact

1523
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,760
same thing to someone else

1524
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:52,760
and pushed that off on someone else

1525
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,760
fucks with me.

1526
00:59:54,760 --> 00:59:56,760
And I'm fucking sorry.

1527
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,760
Vanessa actually managed

1528
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:00,760
for one fleeting moment

1529
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:02,760
to make a connection between

1530
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,760
her own past hurt and trauma

1531
01:00:04,760 --> 01:00:06,760
and the pain she'd inflicted on another

1532
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,760
person. Which is kind of a once in a lifetime

1533
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,760
event on a website

1534
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:12,760
where the performers are remorseless

1535
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:14,760
psychopaths who wouldn't muddy their

1536
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,760
shoes to save a drowning child

1537
01:00:16,760 --> 01:00:18,760
and the viewers are cold blooded

1538
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,760
sadists who consume human misery

1539
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,760
like a glutton, gorging him

1540
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,760
at a particularly

1541
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:26,760
sumptuous buffet.

1542
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,760
You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson

1543
01:00:28,760 --> 01:00:30,760
that I should really try to stick to

1544
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,760
ideas, opinions,

1545
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,760
policy.

1546
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,760
However, this lesson would not last.

1547
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,760
Vanessa kept doing

1548
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,760
SJW cringe content

1549
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,760
well past the point it had become

1550
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,760
passé, making a video with

1551
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,760
Big Red in the thumbnail

1552
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:48,760
as recently as 2019.

1553
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:50,760
I admit, I thought she was

1554
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,760
fading into irrelevance.

1555
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:54,760
But again, I underestimated Vanessa.

1556
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,760
In July 2019,

1557
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,760
her channel rocketed to a new

1558
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,760
level of success when she released

1559
01:01:00,760 --> 01:01:02,760
a video titled

1560
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,760
Exposing Jessica Yaniv

1561
01:01:04,760 --> 01:01:06,760
Trans Predator.

1562
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:08,760
In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm

1563
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:10,760
about a trans woman, or rather

1564
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,760
she believes, a man posing

1565
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,760
as a trans woman, called

1566
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:16,760
Jessica Yaniv.

1567
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:18,760
Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?

1568
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:20,760
Well, as far as

1569
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,760
I can tell, everything

1570
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:24,760
Vanessa says about Yaniv

1571
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:26,760
is true. Yaniv attempted

1572
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:28,760
to use a Canadian human rights

1573
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:30,760
tribunal to close down several

1574
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,760
beauty salons that had refused to wax

1575
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,760
her hairy balls after she approached

1576
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,760
them about it in an awkward and creepy

1577
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:38,760
way. She has a long history of sending

1578
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,760
extremely inappropriate

1579
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:42,760
messages to underage girls.

1580
01:01:42,760 --> 01:01:44,760
And, she attempted to host

1581
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,760
a topless pool party

1582
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,760
for unchaperoned children.

1583
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:50,760
Basically, Yaniv is someone who

1584
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,760
appropriates the language of

1585
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:54,760
transgender acceptance and equality

1586
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:56,760
to cloak predatory behavior

1587
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,760
toward minors. And my read

1588
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:00,760
on Yaniv, by the way, is not

1589
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:02,760
that she's a cunning manipulator,

1590
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:04,760
but that this is someone who is

1591
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,760
mentally not playing

1592
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,760
with a full deck. After the success

1593
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,760
of her initial video, Vanessa

1594
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:12,760
made a few more videos about Yaniv

1595
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:14,760
rebranding herself as a kind of

1596
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:16,760
transsexual Chris Hansen,

1597
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:18,760
exposing TRANSGENDER

1598
01:02:18,760 --> 01:02:20,760
PREDATORS wherever

1599
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,760
she could find them. And it

1600
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:24,760
turns out, first, I was honestly

1601
01:02:24,760 --> 01:02:26,760
kind of loving this for Vanessa.

1602
01:02:26,760 --> 01:02:28,760
At least now she's finally picking on

1603
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,760
someone who deserves it. But the more

1604
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,760
I think about it, the more

1605
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:34,760
hesitations I have. One,

1606
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,760
is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv

1607
01:02:36,760 --> 01:02:38,760
story and the lack of attention

1608
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,760
given to it by other trans public

1609
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,760
figures as an indictment of

1610
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:44,760
trans activists.

1611
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,760
Who Vanessa thinks should spend more time

1612
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,760
sounding the alarm about

1613
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:50,760
TRANSGENDER

1614
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,760
PREDATORS. And I'm willing to

1615
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:54,760
admit, there's probably

1616
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,760
a valid point in there somewhere.

1617
01:02:56,760 --> 01:02:58,760
Like, some trans people really are

1618
01:02:58,760 --> 01:03:00,760
so paranoid about transphobes framing

1619
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,760
all of us as dangerous perverts

1620
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,760
that they basically look the other

1621
01:03:04,760 --> 01:03:06,760
way and refuse to acknowledge

1622
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,760
the small but real subset of trans

1623
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,760
people who are, in fact,

1624
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,760
dangerous perverts. But Blair,

1625
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:14,760
you talk about the Yaniv

1626
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:16,760
situation like it's urgent

1627
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:18,760
breaking news. Like Yaniv should

1628
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,760
rightfully be a household name,

1629
01:03:20,760 --> 01:03:22,760
but for the stubborn silence of trans

1630
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:24,760
activists. But why?

1631
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:26,760
Why should everyone be focused

1632
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,760
on Jessica Yaniv? There's more

1633
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,760
than 100,000 sexual assaults

1634
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:32,760
reported to American law enforcement

1635
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,760
every year. The literal president of

1636
01:03:34,760 --> 01:03:36,760
America is a bit of a sexual

1637
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,760
predator himself. Why

1638
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,760
fixate on this one particular

1639
01:03:40,760 --> 01:03:42,760
Canadian creep? I guess you could

1640
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:44,760
argue that since Yaniv is a

1641
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:46,760
trans-identified predator,

1642
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,760
a tip. We as real trans

1643
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,760
people have a responsibility

1644
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,760
to be the ones who lead the charge to stop

1645
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:54,760
her. Or at least it would be good

1646
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:56,760
optics for us to do that.

1647
01:03:56,760 --> 01:03:58,760
And again, I think there's maybe some truth

1648
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:00,760
to that, like initially

1649
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,760
the LGBT website Pink News

1650
01:04:02,760 --> 01:04:04,760
straightforwardly reported Yaniv's

1651
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:06,760
claims of discrimination, which

1652
01:04:06,760 --> 01:04:08,760
is pretty embarrassing and

1653
01:04:08,760 --> 01:04:10,760
not great optics, but I don't think

1654
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,760
that constantly broadcasting

1655
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:14,760
updates about the trans

1656
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:16,760
gender is really the best

1657
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:18,760
optics for us either. Why did

1658
01:04:18,760 --> 01:04:20,760
Vanessa make this video in the first place?

1659
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:22,760
Is it simply because she

1660
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:24,760
cares deeply about the well-being

1661
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,760
of children, and she

1662
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:28,760
thought making a video exposing

1663
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,760
Jessica Yaniv is the best

1664
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:32,760
way to protect them?

1665
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:34,760
I mean, I'm sure she cares a little

1666
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,760
bit about the children, but it's

1667
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:38,760
still a YouTube video, and

1668
01:04:38,760 --> 01:04:40,760
you have to ask, is the

1669
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,760
primary intention here really

1670
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:44,760
to stop a predator? Or

1671
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,760
is it to manufacture

1672
01:04:46,760 --> 01:04:48,760
a sleazy entertainment

1673
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:50,760
spectacle? Shortly after her

1674
01:04:50,760 --> 01:04:52,760
first Yaniv video was published,

1675
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:54,760
Vanessa hosted a live stream

1676
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,760
on her channel titled

1677
01:04:56,760 --> 01:04:58,760
Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv

1678
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,760
Trans Predator.

1679
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:02,760
This got 2 million views.

1680
01:05:02,760 --> 01:05:04,760
Is this what you do with

1681
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,760
someone you've just accused of

1682
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,760
pedophilia? You host a live

1683
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:10,760
event debating

1684
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,760
the pedophile on your YouTube

1685
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,760
channel? What's to debate?

1686
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:16,760
I don't need to be scared in my own house

1687
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:18,760
that I'm gonna get fucking attacked

1688
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:20,760
which is illegal

1689
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,760
in Canada, just saying. But

1690
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,760
you think that was, like, cute?

1691
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:28,760
Was that a moment for you?

1692
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:30,760
Then of course, you sell t-shirts

1693
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,760
featuring the meme that resulted

1694
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,760
from your YouTube pedophile

1695
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:36,760
debate. I mean, that makes sense.

1696
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:38,760
If you're gonna catch a predator,

1697
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:40,760
you gotta sell pedophile debate

1698
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,760
merch. And of course, you

1699
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,760
gotta follow the pedophile's makeup

1700
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:46,760
tutorial, you know,

1701
01:05:46,760 --> 01:05:48,760
for the children.

1702
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,760
Now, I hate to be overly

1703
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:52,760
critical, but when I look

1704
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,760
at this, I don't see

1705
01:05:54,760 --> 01:05:56,760
a high-minded activist

1706
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:58,760
working to protect children and

1707
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,760
trans people's image. I see

1708
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,760
a tabloid entertainer

1709
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,760
who's discovered a way to

1710
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,760
monetize milking lulz

1711
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,760
from a mentally defective

1712
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,760
pervert. And I have to say,

1713
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,760
Blair, as a connoisseur of trash

1714
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:14,760
myself, I'm very entertained

1715
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,760
by all of this. Following

1716
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:18,760
a sexual predator's makeup

1717
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,760
tutorial? That's

1718
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,760
genius. I wish I'd

1719
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:24,760
thought of that. But just be honest.

1720
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:26,760
This isn't activism.

1721
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,760
This isn't justice.

1722
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:30,760
It's a lolcow cult.

1723
01:06:30,760 --> 01:06:32,760
It's like one of Mari's transsexuals

1724
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:34,760
took over the show. And I love

1725
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,760
that for her. I love that

1726
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,760
for her. But Blair,

1727
01:06:38,760 --> 01:06:40,760
I can't help but notice

1728
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:42,760
you're still hitting all the

1729
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,760
same beats your videos have always

1730
01:06:44,760 --> 01:06:46,760
hit. Attention, everyone.

1731
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:48,760
There is a bad

1732
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,760
transgender in our midst.

1733
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:52,760
The bad transgender

1734
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,760
is not a real transgender like

1735
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,760
me. It's very important

1736
01:06:56,760 --> 01:06:58,760
that we all gather round

1737
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,760
to condemn this bad

1738
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,760
transgender who is not a real

1739
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,760
transgender. And Blair, I'll give you

1740
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:06,760
this. You are getting better at

1741
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:08,760
choosing your targets. The transvestite

1742
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:10,760
monster is a stock character in

1743
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,760
our culture, and Jessica Yaniv

1744
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,760
is good casting for the part.

1745
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,760
She's a transphobe's boogeyman

1746
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,760
come to life, and I certainly

1747
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:20,760
am not shedding any tears for her. But

1748
01:07:20,760 --> 01:07:22,760
you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this

1749
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,760
seriously as anything more than

1750
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:26,760
a smarter version of the same

1751
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,760
in-group cringe humilitainment

1752
01:07:28,760 --> 01:07:30,760
you've always made. And by the way,

1753
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,760
you may want to check in

1754
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:34,760
on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.

1755
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:36,760
Rose of Dawn is another

1756
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:38,760
conservative trans woman YouTuber

1757
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,760
who produces a series called Trans

1758
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,760
Stupid. Hi, everyone, and

1759
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,760
welcome to another edition of Trans

1760
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:46,760
Stupid, the show where I take a look at the

1761
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:48,760
wonderful world of LGBTQIA++

1762
01:07:48,760 --> 01:07:50,760
news because

1763
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,760
stupidity is intersectional.

1764
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,760
Transgender.

1765
01:07:54,760 --> 01:07:56,760
More like trans

1766
01:07:56,760 --> 01:07:58,760
retarded. More like trans

1767
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,760
gay.

1768
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:02,760
Trans gay.

1769
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,760
I love that. I'm literally, I just

1770
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:06,760
realized I'm literally trans gay. Rose's

1771
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,760
channel is allegedly about the

1772
01:08:08,760 --> 01:08:10,760
excesses of trans ideology

1773
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,760
and activism, which in theory

1774
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:14,760
I do think is a perspective

1775
01:08:14,760 --> 01:08:16,760
worth including in the conversation.

1776
01:08:16,760 --> 01:08:18,760
But in practice,

1777
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:20,760
well, let's just say Rose

1778
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,760
has produced a 30-minute documentary

1779
01:08:22,760 --> 01:08:24,760
about why Chris Chan is not

1780
01:08:24,760 --> 01:08:26,760
a real transgender. There is a

1781
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,760
bad transgender in our

1782
01:08:28,760 --> 01:08:30,760
midst. The bad transgender

1783
01:08:30,760 --> 01:08:32,760
is not a real transgender

1784
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,760
like me. I'm getting pretty tired

1785
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:36,760
of this. And here's her transition advice

1786
01:08:36,760 --> 01:08:38,760
to trans women just beginning their

1787
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,760
journey. You probably have this image in your

1788
01:08:40,760 --> 01:08:42,760
head that, you know, you're going to be this really

1789
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,760
cute-looking trans

1790
01:08:44,760 --> 01:08:46,760
woman. Like, effectively, you're going to be this

1791
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:48,760
seal. Like, look at this seal.

1792
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:50,760
Isn't this seal adorable?

1793
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,760
You're so cute. But

1794
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:54,760
the truth is, you're probably not

1795
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:56,760
looking like this seal right now, are you?

1796
01:08:56,760 --> 01:08:58,760
You're probably more like this big

1797
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,760
bull seal, barging your

1798
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,760
way into women's bathrooms

1799
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:04,760
saying, this is a woman's

1800
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:06,760
body. Now,

1801
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:08,760
you might never reach the

1802
01:09:08,760 --> 01:09:10,760
cute seal phase. In fact,

1803
01:09:10,760 --> 01:09:12,760
very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.

1804
01:09:12,760 --> 01:09:14,760
Rose, no.

1805
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,760
Do not simp for Vanessa.

1806
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,760
It only encourages her. She's also

1807
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:20,760
made no less than 20

1808
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,760
videos about Jessica Yaniv.

1809
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:24,760
Which seems like kind of a lot,

1810
01:09:24,760 --> 01:09:26,760
Gorge. Would I be wrong to say I'm

1811
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:28,760
getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction

1812
01:09:28,760 --> 01:09:30,760
vibe? In these videos, Rose

1813
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,760
chronicles Yaniv's numerous crimes and

1814
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:34,760
wrongdoings, but she also

1815
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:36,760
cannot resist making it

1816
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:38,760
very clear how disgusted

1817
01:09:38,760 --> 01:09:40,760
she is with Yaniv's

1818
01:09:40,760 --> 01:09:42,760
appearance. The irony being

1819
01:09:42,760 --> 01:09:44,760
that this kind of tweet came from someone who you

1820
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:46,760
could smell just by looking at

1821
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:48,760
a picture of them. I bring this up,

1822
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,760
again, not because I have

1823
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,760
any interest at all in white knighting

1824
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:54,760
for Yaniv. I do not support

1825
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,760
her journey. As far as I'm concerned,

1826
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,760
she can eat shit. And maybe

1827
01:09:58,760 --> 01:10:00,760
she does. I wouldn't be surprised.

1828
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,760
No, my point is that part of the

1829
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:04,760
catharsis that Rose and Vanessa

1830
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:06,760
seem to derive from making

1831
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,760
this kind of content

1832
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,760
comes from contrasting themselves

1833
01:10:10,760 --> 01:10:12,760
as good, presentable,

1834
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:14,760
real trans people with

1835
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:16,760
the hideousness of the wretched

1836
01:10:16,760 --> 01:10:18,760
fake trans dump

1837
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,760
truck. A classic Vanessa

1838
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:22,760
thumbnail is divided

1839
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,760
into two halves. On

1840
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,760
one half, Vanessa

1841
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:28,760
looking fish, looking

1842
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,760
cunt.

1843
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:36,760
Always with her lip gloss in the livestreams.

1844
01:10:36,760 --> 01:10:38,760
And in the other half of the

1845
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:40,760
thumbnail, for contrast,

1846
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:42,760
the tragic dump truck

1847
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:44,760
in a maladjusted wig.

1848
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:46,760
And I'm allowed to say dump truck because before

1849
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,760
I transitioned, I was one of Vanessa's

1850
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:50,760
dump trucks. I was one of

1851
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,760
her dump trucks.

1852
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,760
Look, I happen to

1853
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,760
possess a little thing

1854
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:58,760
you probably haven't heard of it, called

1855
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:00,760
inner beauty. That's right, sweetie.

1856
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,760
My pancreas?

1857
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:04,760
Unclockable.

1858
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,760
Meanwhile, Rose,

1859
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,760
who prefers to represent herself

1860
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:10,760
with this cartoon,

1861
01:11:10,760 --> 01:11:12,760
okay, straight up

1862
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:14,760
refers to Yaniv as

1863
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:16,760
the tubby troon in the Titanic

1864
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:18,760
Tranner of Canada.

1865
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,760
A particular Titanic Tranner of Canada?

1866
01:11:20,760 --> 01:11:22,760
Tranner and

1867
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,760
troon being pejoratives for

1868
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:26,760
transgender that I associate

1869
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:28,760
with 4chan, where I'm guessing

1870
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:30,760
Rose has spent a lot of time.

1871
01:11:32,760 --> 01:11:34,760
As for the emphatic revulsion

1872
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,760
toward Yaniv's fatness, well,

1873
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,760
I'm guessing that must be another

1874
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:40,760
important part of stopping a predator, right?

1875
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,760
It seems almost

1876
01:11:42,760 --> 01:11:44,760
taboo to condemn people

1877
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:46,760
for how rough they look, when

1878
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,760
I think that that tough love in a

1879
01:11:48,760 --> 01:11:50,760
way is needed, because

1880
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:52,760
I look at what I looked like when I

1881
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:54,760
first transitioned, and

1882
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,760
Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.

1883
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,760
Like, I looked

1884
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,760
bad. Like, I was overweight,

1885
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:02,760
I had a poor taste

1886
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,760
in clothes. Like, I was

1887
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,760
never wearing stupid dresses or anything,

1888
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:08,760
it was mostly t-shirts and jeans.

1889
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:10,760
You're probably more like this big bullseed

1890
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,760
barging your way into

1891
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:14,760
women's bathrooms, saying

1892
01:12:14,760 --> 01:12:16,760
this is a woman's body.

1893
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,760
Now, you might

1894
01:12:18,760 --> 01:12:20,760
never reach me. You'd see

1895
01:12:20,760 --> 01:12:22,760
me fake, so in fact, very few of us

1896
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,760
turn out to look like Claire White. And I want to make

1897
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:26,760
it very clear that when I'm talking about

1898
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,760
transition, I don't mean that

1899
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:30,760
you're going to- Rose...

1900
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,760
Are you okay? No.

1901
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,760
You're not okay. None of us are okay.

1902
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:36,760
No trans woman, remotely

1903
01:12:36,760 --> 01:12:38,760
in the public eye, is in any way

1904
01:12:38,760 --> 01:12:40,760
okay. And look, I don't want to take

1905
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:42,760
this psychoanalysis too far, because

1906
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,760
I don't know, from watching YouTube

1907
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,760
videos, what's going on in someone's head.

1908
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:48,760
But I can try to make intelligent inferences,

1909
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:50,760
and I think it's pretty revealing

1910
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:52,760
that this is how Rose

1911
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,760
introduces the topic of Jessica

1912
01:12:54,760 --> 01:12:56,760
Yaniv. Being, well, one of the

1913
01:12:56,760 --> 01:12:58,760
biggest characters in the

1914
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:00,760
whole fucking world at the moment,

1915
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:02,760
which is Jessica Yaniv.

1916
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,760
Rose?

1917
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:06,760
Gorge?

1918
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:08,760
Jessica Yaniv is not one of

1919
01:13:08,760 --> 01:13:10,760
the biggest characters

1920
01:13:10,760 --> 01:13:12,760
in the whole world

1921
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:14,760
at any moment. This is not

1922
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:16,760
a world historical figure.

1923
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:18,760
At the end of the day, this is a more or less

1924
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:20,760
random civilian sex fiend off

1925
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,760
the streets of Vancouver, BC.

1926
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:24,760
The only reason anyone has heard of her at all

1927
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,760
is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch

1928
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:28,760
a predator and turn this grimy

1929
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,760
reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.

1930
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,760
She is not one of the most important

1931
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:34,760
characters in the world. But it sounds

1932
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:36,760
like what she is, Rose, is

1933
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,760
one of the most important characters

1934
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:40,760
in your brain. This is distorted thinking.

1935
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:42,760
It's like A-Log comparing

1936
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,760
Chris Chan to Hitler. You're so deep

1937
01:13:44,760 --> 01:13:46,760
in the morbid cringe obsession that

1938
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,760
you've lost perspective. And I'm sure

1939
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,760
you have what seem to you like perfectly

1940
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,760
logical reasons why you're devoting so much

1941
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:54,760
attention to this. And I know videos

1942
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:56,760
about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I'm

1943
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:58,760
sure that's a factor too. But Rose,

1944
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:00,760
I also know a morbid cringe obsession

1945
01:14:00,760 --> 01:14:02,760
when I see one. And I know

1946
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,760
that being a visible trans woman on the

1947
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,760
internet is more difficult than most

1948
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,760
people can imagine. And I know

1949
01:14:08,760 --> 01:14:10,760
that pretty much every trans person is

1950
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,760
bullied or shamed or humiliated

1951
01:14:12,760 --> 01:14:14,760
at some point in our lives. And I know

1952
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,760
how good it can feel to

1953
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,760
take all the horrible things transphobic

1954
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,760
noobs and bullies and TERFs have said about

1955
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,760
us, and repeat them

1956
01:14:22,760 --> 01:14:24,760
verbatim about some

1957
01:14:24,760 --> 01:14:26,760
big, fat, fake,

1958
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,760
dangerous, delusional, disgusting

1959
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:30,760
male fetishist. Oh,

1960
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,760
it feels good to be the TERF for

1961
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:34,760
once. It feels good to be the

1962
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,760
judge rather than the judged.

1963
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:38,760
Because when you point the finger at someone else,

1964
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,760
you're also pointing away

1965
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,760
from yourself. And it's not

1966
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,760
lost on me that in conservative circles,

1967
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,760
queer people are often treated like

1968
01:14:46,760 --> 01:14:48,760
suspected sex criminals by default.

1969
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:50,760
So there's safety in being the

1970
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:52,760
one who spearheads the think of the children

1971
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,760
type moral crusade. And when

1972
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,760
you expose a trans predator,

1973
01:14:56,760 --> 01:14:58,760
you get that feeling of

1974
01:14:58,760 --> 01:15:00,760
safety plus the relief

1975
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,760
of having someone in particular

1976
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,760
to blame for the shame

1977
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:06,760
and stigma we all feel.

1978
01:15:06,760 --> 01:15:08,760
Jessica Yaniv is the reason

1979
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,760
people hate us. But that's just not true.

1980
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:12,760
It's a simple answer to a

1981
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,760
complicated problem. It's scapegoating.

1982
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,760
When I look at the Yaniv

1983
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,760
obsession on trans YouTube,

1984
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,760
I see a community trying

1985
01:15:20,760 --> 01:15:22,760
to cope with stigma and

1986
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,760
hoping that destroying a scapegoat

1987
01:15:24,760 --> 01:15:26,760
will bring relief. It's basically

1988
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,760
a blood sacrifice.

1989
01:15:28,760 --> 01:15:30,760
It's not rational. It feels

1990
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,760
good for a moment,

1991
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:34,760
but it's an addiction. It won't ever

1992
01:15:34,760 --> 01:15:36,760
erase the stigma and the shame.

1993
01:15:36,760 --> 01:15:38,760
And Yaniv is simply the latest

1994
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:40,760
and most deserving in a

1995
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,760
long line of bad

1996
01:15:42,760 --> 01:15:44,760
transgenders who aren't real transgenders

1997
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,760
and are giving us a bad name

1998
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:48,760
and are the reason people hate us and

1999
01:15:48,760 --> 01:15:50,760
want us to be condemned and destroyed.

2000
01:15:50,760 --> 01:15:52,760
But when Yaniv is finally gone,

2001
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:54,760
when you get her sent to prison or whatever your

2002
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,760
goal is, you're just gonna find a new

2003
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:58,760
scapegoat to take her place.

2004
01:15:58,760 --> 01:16:00,760
And the shame cycle continues.

2005
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:02,760
The humiliation and bullying we've experienced

2006
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,760
is internalized as shame.

2007
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,760
When we project that shame onto

2008
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,760
scapegoats and onto each other,

2009
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:10,760
it becomes cringing and contempt.

2010
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:12,760
And we voice that contempt

2011
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:14,760
by shaming other people,

2012
01:16:14,760 --> 01:16:16,760
which starts a new cycle.

2013
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:18,760
So you can keep finding new scapegoats,

2014
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:20,760
new punching bags, new shame dumps,

2015
01:16:20,760 --> 01:16:22,760
new lolcows, and you can end up like

2016
01:16:22,760 --> 01:16:24,760
one of the people who's been archiving

2017
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:26,760
Chris Chan for 13 years.

2018
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:28,760
But that will never really heal us.

2019
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:30,760
God, how do I get out of this video?

2020
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,760
I'm trying to have a serious conversation

2021
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,760
dressed as some sort of catgirl degenerate.

2022
01:16:34,760 --> 01:16:36,760
Cringe. Shame.

2023
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,760
I'm ashamed. Don't look at me.

2024
01:16:38,760 --> 01:16:40,760
You know,

2025
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:42,760
I love wearing florals in front of flowers.

2026
01:16:42,760 --> 01:16:44,760
Thank you, yes.

2027
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,760
I suppose it is groundbreaking.

2028
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,760
Alright children, let's review our notes

2029
01:16:48,760 --> 01:16:50,760
on cringe. The word cringe really describes

2030
01:16:50,760 --> 01:16:52,760
two different emotions,

2031
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:54,760
either embarrassment or contempt.

2032
01:16:54,760 --> 01:16:56,760
You can feel either one for yourself

2033
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:58,760
or for someone else. When you're embarrassed

2034
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,760
for someone else, we call that vicarious

2035
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:02,760
embarrassment. And that can mean cringing

2036
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:04,760
with someone who is embarrassed themselves,

2037
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,760
which I've argued is excluded

2038
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:08,760
in the internet usage of the word cringe.

2039
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,760
Or it can mean embarrassment for someone

2040
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,760
who isn't embarrassed themselves,

2041
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:14,760
in which case we say we're cringing at them.

2042
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:16,760
Now if someone who's part of your

2043
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,760
in-group is embarrassing themselves,

2044
01:17:18,760 --> 01:17:20,760
by proxy, embarrassing the in-group

2045
01:17:20,760 --> 01:17:22,760
that includes you, you feel

2046
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:24,760
in-group cringe, which can involve

2047
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:26,760
both vicarious embarrassment

2048
01:17:26,760 --> 01:17:28,760
and a kind of self-cringe.

2049
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:30,760
And on the contempt side, contempt

2050
01:17:30,760 --> 01:17:32,760
for someone who shares traits in common with

2051
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,760
you, particularly if they're traits you have

2052
01:17:34,760 --> 01:17:36,760
contempt for in yourself, can

2053
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:38,760
develop into morbid cringe,

2054
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,760
which is that obsession with a lol cow,

2055
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,760
that addiction to contemptuous

2056
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:44,760
gazing at a dark mirror in which

2057
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,760
you see reflected everything you hate about

2058
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,760
yourself or about your in-group.

2059
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:50,760
Now I want to end this video by reflecting

2060
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,760
on whether cringe is good or bad,

2061
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,760
healthy or harmful.

2062
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,760
And I do think that in some situations,

2063
01:17:56,760 --> 01:17:58,760
cringe is good.

2064
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,760
Embarrassment serves a social purpose.

2065
01:18:00,760 --> 01:18:02,760
It helps us interact smoothly with each other

2066
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:04,760
by telling us what not to do.

2067
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:06,760
And empathizing with other people's embarrassing

2068
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:08,760
stories can be cathartic.

2069
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:10,760
It can make you feel closer to other people,

2070
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:12,760
more alike, less alone.

2071
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,760
I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe

2072
01:18:14,760 --> 01:18:16,760
is very healthy. It shows you're

2073
01:18:16,760 --> 01:18:18,760
self-aware, and you care at least

2074
01:18:18,760 --> 01:18:20,760
a little bit what other people think.

2075
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:22,760
You know, I've met people who never cringe

2076
01:18:22,760 --> 01:18:24,760
at themselves, and let's just say

2077
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:26,760
they're not my kind of people.

2078
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:28,760
They're narcissists who think super highly

2079
01:18:28,760 --> 01:18:30,760
of themselves, regardless of how they're

2080
01:18:30,760 --> 01:18:32,760
actually coming across. But I think partly

2081
01:18:32,760 --> 01:18:34,760
out of fear of ending up like one of those

2082
01:18:34,760 --> 01:18:36,760
people, I've overcompensated.

2083
01:18:36,760 --> 01:18:38,760
And I cringe too much.

2084
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,760
Both at myself, and at other people.

2085
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,760
It's a habit that's kind of

2086
01:18:42,760 --> 01:18:44,760
making me hate myself, and it's making

2087
01:18:44,760 --> 01:18:46,760
me unfairly contemptuous towards

2088
01:18:46,760 --> 01:18:48,760
others. And when I take a look around the

2089
01:18:48,760 --> 01:18:50,760
internet, like I've done in this video,

2090
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:52,760
I find that I'm not

2091
01:18:52,760 --> 01:18:54,760
alone in this situation. And it's

2092
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,760
not cute. So, how do we

2093
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:58,760
cringe less? Well, the cliche solution

2094
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,760
is self-love, which our culture

2095
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:02,760
places a lot of value on.

2096
01:19:02,760 --> 01:19:04,760
Self-love and self-esteem.

2097
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,760
You know, I don't care what haters

2098
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,760
and losers say. I'm a bad bitch.

2099
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,760
I look like a supermodel.

2100
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,760
I'm a genius.

2101
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:14,760
We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way.

2102
01:19:14,760 --> 01:19:16,760
But it doesn't work, because it's not

2103
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:18,760
realistic. You don't look like a supermodel.

2104
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,760
And you're not a genius.

2105
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,760
And when you realize that, you fall from one

2106
01:19:22,760 --> 01:19:24,760
extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls

2107
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:26,760
the self-esteem tower of terror.

2108
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:28,760
You go from self-love to self-hate.

2109
01:19:28,760 --> 01:19:30,760
But self-hate is also

2110
01:19:30,760 --> 01:19:32,760
a distortion. Recently I was listening to

2111
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:34,760
a David Foster Wallace interview.

2112
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,760
Yeah, I know. Cringe. And he attacked

2113
01:19:36,760 --> 01:19:38,760
me mercilessly and unprovoked.

2114
01:19:38,760 --> 01:19:40,760
There's a lot of narcissism and self-hatred.

2115
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:42,760
How

2116
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:44,760
dare you notice that? I'm in this

2117
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:46,760
photo and I don't like it.

2118
01:19:46,760 --> 01:19:48,760
But it's true! Time spent

2119
01:19:48,760 --> 01:19:50,760
cringing at yourself is still

2120
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,760
time spent obsessing over yourself.

2121
01:19:52,760 --> 01:19:54,760
And it's hard not to, because

2122
01:19:54,760 --> 01:19:56,760
humans are animals, so our

2123
01:19:56,760 --> 01:19:58,760
perspective is egocentric by nature.

2124
01:19:58,760 --> 01:20:00,760
But we can still learn to appreciate

2125
01:20:00,760 --> 01:20:02,760
that the world is bigger

2126
01:20:02,760 --> 01:20:04,760
than us. I mean, I've heard rumors.

2127
01:20:04,760 --> 01:20:06,760
In that book we started with, Cringeworthy,

2128
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,760
Melissa Doll advocates not

2129
01:20:08,760 --> 01:20:10,760
self-love or self-hate, but what

2130
01:20:10,760 --> 01:20:12,760
she calls self-indifference.

2131
01:20:12,760 --> 01:20:14,760
She says,

2132
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:16,760
Self-indifference is the relief

2133
01:20:16,760 --> 01:20:18,760
of realizing that you are simply

2134
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:20,760
not that big a deal.

2135
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:22,760
So yeah, I was pretty

2136
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:24,760
cringey in the past, and

2137
01:20:24,760 --> 01:20:26,760
I'm still pretty cringey now, but

2138
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,760
you know what? Everyone else

2139
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,760
is pretty cringey too. And the world's

2140
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,760
probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway,

2141
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,760
so I don't know if I would call this

2142
01:20:34,760 --> 01:20:36,760
good news, but if it's

2143
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,760
any consolation, uh,

2144
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:40,760
nothing matters.

2145
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:42,760
Nothing matters.

2146
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,760
Nothing matters.

2147
01:20:44,760 --> 01:20:46,760
Nothing matters.

2148
01:20:46,760 --> 01:20:48,760
Nothing matters.

2149
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:50,760
