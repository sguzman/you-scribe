WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:15.180
All right, so what are we looking at? What new hell have we sunk to now here in the United States?

00:15.180 --> 00:18.740
They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine. You're not really fine,

00:18.840 --> 00:21.140
but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.

00:21.200 --> 00:26.980
Well, it's a Kentucky police patrol car with a Blue Lives Matter thin blue line

00:26.980 --> 00:34.400
Punisher skull on the hood. Um, there's a lot to unpack here, but let's stick to tradition and

00:34.400 --> 00:39.440
begin by examining the skull. The skull is the symbol of the Punisher, the Marvel Comics

00:39.440 --> 00:44.360
vigilante antihero. The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglione, but he changed it to Frank

00:44.360 --> 00:49.140
Castle, I guess because he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage. Disappointing. Frank Castle

00:49.140 --> 00:53.840
is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him an empty husk of a man

00:53.840 --> 00:56.540
whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.

00:56.980 --> 01:01.200
There's been a lot of TV and movie adaptations of the Punisher, and as research for this video,

01:01.300 --> 01:06.960
I did watch all of them, and my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where

01:06.960 --> 01:11.680
Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass as Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty in

01:11.680 --> 01:18.480
the sewers, worshiping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash. You know, just like the police do.

01:18.480 --> 01:26.900
Number 60. Hi, I am Natalie, creator of Catra Points. And no, I'm not a cat girl. I'm a cat

01:26.900 --> 01:26.960
woman. I'm a cat woman. I'm a cat woman. I'm a cat woman. I'm a cat woman. I'm a cat woman.

01:26.960 --> 01:31.720
I'm sorry you're intimidated by that. Look, I'm tired of only being valued for my petite

01:31.720 --> 01:38.960
heterosexual body. I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife, and

01:38.960 --> 01:47.800
as a woman with values. Just kidding, I'm trash. Let's talk about justice,

01:47.940 --> 01:51.680
Ulu. Justice is when I get lots of head pats.

01:52.180 --> 01:56.420
The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family,

01:56.420 --> 02:01.260
but once he gets revenge, he can't stop killing, because it's the only thing that gives meaning to

02:01.260 --> 02:06.960
his shitty life. So he wages a one-man war on organized crime. But no matter how many bad guys

02:06.960 --> 02:12.460
he kills, it's never enough, because new criminals just come along and take the place of the old

02:12.460 --> 02:18.300
ones. It's like a cycle, where violence begets violence, and nothing ever really changes.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.280
It's almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime

02:23.280 --> 02:26.060
and punishment. But you know what? Let's not overthink this.

02:26.060 --> 02:30.100
Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car. Great. Perfect.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.580
Are we the baddies?

02:31.700 --> 02:36.540
Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these lip-tarded, Antifa-sympathizing,

02:37.020 --> 02:42.280
big government anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte,

02:42.780 --> 02:47.420
criticizing the police, even though I could never do a job one-tenth as difficult as theirs.

02:47.660 --> 02:51.980
And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct?

02:51.980 --> 02:55.540
This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.

02:56.060 --> 02:59.520
There's nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose of the

02:59.520 --> 03:02.820
chemical you're addicted to. They tried to make me go to rehab. I said,

03:03.440 --> 03:11.880
Like, you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor at the

03:11.880 --> 03:16.380
free marketplace of Ideas Gorge. And as a reasonable person, I'm sure you wouldn't

03:16.380 --> 03:19.860
dismiss my argument just because I happen to enjoy headpats.

03:19.860 --> 03:25.220
As Socrates once said, two plus two is four is equally true, whether uttered by a philosopher

03:25.220 --> 03:25.860
king or a...

03:26.060 --> 03:27.060
peasant knave.

03:27.060 --> 03:28.060
Or a neko mimi.

03:28.060 --> 03:31.060
Kawaii days!

03:31.060 --> 03:33.060
Is this problematic?

03:33.060 --> 03:39.460
Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it. This is beyond cringe. This is cursed, children! Cursed!

03:39.460 --> 03:44.580
So actually, Socrates didn't say this quote, I just made it up, but that just proves the point I'm making,

03:44.580 --> 03:47.140
so maybe you should hear me out, meow.

03:47.140 --> 03:51.700
I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared on

03:51.700 --> 03:55.780
social media, spurring on a movement to abolish police and prisons.

03:56.060 --> 04:01.040
But at the same time, there's a growing culture of online vigilantism, where justice is taken

04:01.040 --> 04:06.380
into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.

04:06.380 --> 04:11.260
All of this raises a lot of questions. Questions like, what should the consequences be for

04:11.260 --> 04:16.660
bad behavior? Who should impose these consequences? And under what circumstances? And for what

04:16.660 --> 04:21.060
purpose? If we were to abolish police and prisons, what would take their place?

04:21.060 --> 04:25.060
Oh my god, these contacts. I'm literally doing a whole video with fucking sideways cat eyes. Ridiculous.

04:25.060 --> 04:30.460
Why don't we start with the basics, and ask ourselves, what is Justice Socrates?

04:30.460 --> 04:35.340
It's a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years, with no conclusive answers.

04:37.660 --> 04:42.540
I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video. Because the philosophers were dummies.

04:42.540 --> 04:45.180
And I am very smart, meow.

04:45.180 --> 04:49.020
Ra-Ra-Rasputin 1. Revenge

04:49.020 --> 04:54.940
The Punisher represents a particular idea about what justice is, symbolized by the skull he

04:54.940 --> 05:00.260
wears on his t-shirt, so that bad guys know they're about to get punished.

05:00.260 --> 05:05.900
The Punisher's view is that justice means harming people who harm people. An eye for an eye.

05:05.900 --> 05:11.380
This is called retributive justice, the idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment

05:11.380 --> 05:12.660
in proportion to their crime.

05:12.660 --> 05:18.700
It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is, because it's rooted in our instinct

05:18.700 --> 05:23.620
to strike back at someone who's harmed us. Social animals, like humans and chimpanzees,

05:23.620 --> 05:24.740
often practice revenge.

05:24.940 --> 05:28.080
probably because it serves an evolutionary function.

05:28.080 --> 05:31.160
If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas

05:31.160 --> 05:32.540
and you don't get revenge,

05:32.540 --> 05:35.420
then other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.

05:35.420 --> 05:38.880
But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by,

05:38.880 --> 05:39.720
I don't know,

05:39.720 --> 05:42.460
letting her boyfriend pick parasites out of your fur,

05:42.460 --> 05:45.180
then that sends a message to the other monkeys

05:45.180 --> 05:48.100
that it is not profitable to mess with you.

05:48.100 --> 05:49.740
So our little monkey brains

05:49.740 --> 05:51.820
have evolved a taste for vengeance.

05:51.820 --> 05:54.580
And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us,

05:54.580 --> 05:57.120
our desire for retribution is strong

05:57.120 --> 05:59.460
and our little monkey brains reward us

05:59.460 --> 06:01.760
with a pleasant feeling of catharsis

06:01.760 --> 06:04.500
when justice of this kind is served.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.500
So of course, there's a lot of content out there

06:07.500 --> 06:09.540
devoted to scratching this itch.

06:09.540 --> 06:13.680
For example, there's a subreddit called r slash justice served

06:13.680 --> 06:15.880
with one and a half million subscribers.

06:15.880 --> 06:17.380
I first found justice served

06:17.380 --> 06:19.720
when the popular feed showed me this post

06:19.720 --> 06:22.380
of two teenage thieves stripped naked,

06:22.380 --> 06:24.500
humiliated and photographed

06:24.500 --> 06:26.860
as punishment and all this celebrated

06:26.860 --> 06:29.460
under the heading police justice.

06:29.460 --> 06:32.580
In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police,

06:32.580 --> 06:34.600
the description of the community was

06:34.600 --> 06:37.400
now with 20% more police brutality.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.220
Um, fun fact, this ain't it chief.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.180
Period, full stop.

06:43.180 --> 06:44.620
That's the tweet.

06:44.620 --> 06:46.680
Of course, I subscribed to justice served right away

06:46.680 --> 06:50.080
thinking someone should be keeping an eye on these people.

06:50.080 --> 06:52.180
Here's a typical justice served post.

06:52.180 --> 06:54.080
Woman sets P-E-D-O,

06:54.500 --> 06:58.660
husband on a fire after catching him R-A-P-E,

06:58.660 --> 07:00.300
seven year old daughter,

07:00.300 --> 07:03.740
titled this man got what he deserved.

07:03.740 --> 07:05.540
Instant regret.

07:05.540 --> 07:07.440
Predator exposed.

07:07.440 --> 07:09.180
To be honest, when I wrote this part of the script,

07:09.180 --> 07:10.980
I forgot I was gonna be wearing cat ears.

07:10.980 --> 07:12.600
I'm really out here trying to have a conversation

07:12.600 --> 07:14.140
about immolating sex offenders

07:14.140 --> 07:18.320
while dressed like a aging bargain bin,

07:18.320 --> 07:20.880
Belle Delphine impersonator.

07:20.880 --> 07:23.440
Well, dress for the job you want.

07:23.440 --> 07:23.900
I mean, whom's to, amongst us,

07:23.900 --> 07:26.480
wouldn't set their husband on fire

07:26.480 --> 07:28.360
under those circumstances, right?

07:28.360 --> 07:30.500
Let's look at the comments on that post though.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.140
Let's read the room.

07:32.140 --> 07:34.080
She's a hero, in my opinion.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.200
Should have had it live on television.

07:36.200 --> 07:37.460
Give her a medal.

07:37.460 --> 07:38.880
Give her two medals.

07:38.880 --> 07:41.700
So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze,

07:41.700 --> 07:44.560
but you know, there's always a couple buzz kills in there,

07:44.560 --> 07:46.500
whining as usual about,

07:46.500 --> 07:50.080
oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering on burning people alive

07:50.080 --> 07:52.180
with no due process and no evidence.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.100
Lots of men like to fuck my wife.

07:53.100 --> 07:53.900
Lots of men like to fuck my wife.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.380
Because I'm too busy crying about due process.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.620
But those people get shouted down pretty fast.

07:58.620 --> 08:00.280
They get called pedo simps.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.380
Pedo simp.

08:02.380 --> 08:04.520
So justice served as a community

08:04.520 --> 08:06.300
for people to gather together

08:06.300 --> 08:09.920
and bond over our shared love of extrajudicial violence.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.980
But of course, there's always someone

08:11.980 --> 08:14.020
who takes it a little too far.

08:14.020 --> 08:16.460
On this video of a thief being kicked in the head

08:16.460 --> 08:18.380
until his face is a bloody pulp,

08:18.380 --> 08:19.800
one commenter says,

08:19.800 --> 08:22.380
that's a justice boner for me.

08:22.380 --> 08:23.740
I dream of the day I catch the police.

08:23.740 --> 08:25.920
I dream of the day I catch the thieves that stole from me

08:25.920 --> 08:28.680
and kick the life out of them.

08:28.680 --> 08:30.120
Criminal fail.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.720
Prank gone wrong.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.740
So when the righteous zeal for justice

08:34.740 --> 08:37.080
becomes the cloak of bloodlust,

08:38.140 --> 08:40.500
that is off-putting to some people.

08:40.500 --> 08:43.760
As one disgruntled former Justice Serve subscriber put it,

08:43.760 --> 08:45.720
I wanted to see stories and videos

08:45.720 --> 08:47.980
of assholes getting their comeuppance.

08:47.980 --> 08:51.240
Instead, I got bombarded with an angry,

08:51.240 --> 08:53.220
toxic moral absolutism.

08:53.220 --> 08:55.100
Everything is black and white with them.

08:55.100 --> 08:58.260
If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair,

08:58.260 --> 09:00.920
then you must support giving them a slap on the wrist

09:00.920 --> 09:02.600
and letting them fuck your wife.

09:02.600 --> 09:04.000
Unsubscribed.

09:04.000 --> 09:07.540
But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch

09:07.540 --> 09:10.260
videos of assholes getting their comeuppance.

09:10.260 --> 09:13.060
I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying

09:13.060 --> 09:15.920
some version of this type of content.

09:15.920 --> 09:17.340
There's a lot of subgenres.

09:17.340 --> 09:18.980
You've got justice porn,

09:18.980 --> 09:21.280
play stupid games win stupid prizes,

09:21.280 --> 09:22.640
instant karma,

09:22.640 --> 09:24.300
bad parking revenge,

09:24.300 --> 09:25.500
predator poaching,

09:25.500 --> 09:26.860
What did you just shoot me?

09:26.860 --> 09:28.780
serial killer sentenced to death

09:28.780 --> 09:30.320
and the whole train clapped,

09:30.320 --> 09:32.880
instant justice was served,

09:32.880 --> 09:34.080
karma fails,

09:34.080 --> 09:36.640
stupid people getting what they deserved.

09:36.640 --> 09:37.480
Karma.

09:37.480 --> 09:40.980
A lot of this content has kind of a right-wing feel to it.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.880
Unmarked police justice.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.440
Criminal gets shot after fighting cop.

09:45.440 --> 09:49.240
Home invader takes shotgun blast to the balls.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.360
Arizona.

09:51.360 --> 09:52.260
Just Arizona.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.620
What more is there to say?

09:53.620 --> 09:54.460
Arizona.

09:54.460 --> 09:55.620
Justice served.

09:55.620 --> 09:56.520
Punished.

09:56.520 --> 09:59.580
It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day

09:59.580 --> 10:02.100
fantasizing about how they're gonna kill home intruders

10:02.100 --> 10:03.820
with the gun they keep in the bathroom.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.940
But I don't think this longing for retribution

10:05.940 --> 10:07.740
is distinctively right-wing.

10:07.740 --> 10:11.320
Left-wing people have the exact same emotional response,

10:11.320 --> 10:13.440
they just have it in different situations.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.760
Think about the jubilation on Twitter

10:15.760 --> 10:18.080
when they get a racist Karen fired.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.860
Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man

10:20.860 --> 10:22.080
in front of an apartment building?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.900
Karma.

10:23.900 --> 10:26.420
And she got her husband fired.

10:26.420 --> 10:28.540
Dumb bitch really should have minded her business.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.800
Love to see it.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.860
She will probably end up with community service and a fine.

10:33.860 --> 10:36.100
But I would love to see her in jail

10:36.100 --> 10:38.200
for at least six months.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.200
Firing them was not enough.

10:40.200 --> 10:43.440
Life in prison.

10:43.440 --> 10:46.580
Life in prison.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.160
An example I personally enjoy is that video

10:49.160 --> 10:51.900
of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his power,

10:51.900 --> 10:54.440
to sexually assault a series of black women,

10:54.440 --> 10:56.300
crying in court as he's sentenced

10:56.300 --> 10:58.820
to serve 263 years in prison.

11:01.420 --> 11:03.120
He just cannot believe that he's actually

11:03.120 --> 11:04.740
facing consequences for this.

11:04.740 --> 11:08.220
And of course, there's the much-savored vigilante punching

11:08.220 --> 11:11.380
of NAZI, Richard Spencer.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.480
Let's watch it now.

11:13.480 --> 11:14.840
Please try not to enjoy this.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.780
Remember, this is purely for educational,

11:17.780 --> 11:19.420
monetizable purposes.

11:20.620 --> 11:21.720
It's Pepe's, because...

11:21.720 --> 11:22.960
Has it become kind of a symbol?

11:25.280 --> 11:26.680
That was informative.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.480
But let's be honest, the reason that video was so popular

11:30.480 --> 11:35.480
is people just enjoyed watching an NAZI get what he deserves.

11:37.380 --> 11:38.920
Justice served.

11:38.920 --> 11:39.860
Punished.

11:39.860 --> 11:40.900
Smashing.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.480
Very happy day sounds, boo-boo.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.220
Remember to smash subscribe.

11:46.220 --> 11:49.160
So this punitive, retributive impulse,

11:49.160 --> 11:49.240
no matter how righteous it feels, is still there.

11:49.240 --> 11:51.280
So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels,

11:51.280 --> 11:52.220
is still there.

11:52.220 --> 11:52.580
So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still there.

11:52.580 --> 11:55.620
It's still there, but it's still a situationally form of sadism,

11:55.620 --> 11:57.080
of schadenfreude.

11:57.080 --> 11:59.360
The satisfaction of justice served

11:59.360 --> 12:03.200
is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing

12:03.200 --> 12:06.360
the suffering of someone who deserves it.

12:06.360 --> 12:08.780
Now, the phrase, deserves it,

12:08.780 --> 12:10.740
is doing a lot of work here.

12:10.740 --> 12:12.200
The correct use of that phrase

12:12.200 --> 12:15.400
is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person

12:15.400 --> 12:18.000
and someone who's hiding bodies in the crawlspace.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.940
It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah.

12:19.940 --> 12:19.960
It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah.

12:19.960 --> 12:20.120
It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah.

12:20.120 --> 12:27.340
But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.

12:27.340 --> 12:30.300
It's why we love stories about revenge.

12:30.300 --> 12:36.680
Stories like Mean Girls, The Crow, Oldboy, Titus Andronicus, and Matilda.

12:36.680 --> 12:40.680
Much too good for children.

12:40.680 --> 12:45.120
Revenge is such a popular plotline because it's easy for people to identify with a

12:45.120 --> 12:50.620
revenge-seeking protagonist, and it's just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles

12:50.620 --> 12:51.720
of violence.

12:51.720 --> 12:56.000
This technique was used in one of the first books ever, The Odyssey by Homer.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I stole this copy from my high school.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
And I stole this copy from my college.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.500
I still just read the Sparknotes.

13:01.500 --> 13:02.700
Well, let's read it now.

13:02.700 --> 13:05.240
See, I knew this would be useful someday.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.300
God, he's such a fuckboy.

13:08.300 --> 13:09.900
What does Athena see in this man?

13:09.900 --> 13:11.360
It must be really hot.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.460
Okay, I'm ready for my book report.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.080
So the hero of the story is Odysseus.

13:15.080 --> 13:22.740
And the whole book is him trying to get home to the island of Ithaca after, um, okay, so

13:22.740 --> 13:29.020
in the prequel, Odysseus' shitty friend Menelaus throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him

13:29.020 --> 13:31.480
to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually attracted to.

13:31.480 --> 13:32.480
How dare she?

13:32.480 --> 13:38.120
So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would

13:38.120 --> 13:41.200
do and blowing off some steam at Femboy's symposium.

13:41.200 --> 13:45.060
Anyway, when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is now a

13:45.060 --> 13:50.040
place full of men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry

13:50.040 --> 13:51.040
his wife.

13:51.040 --> 13:55.960
So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife's suitors

13:55.960 --> 13:57.280
as payback.

13:57.280 --> 14:02.980
And then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors and he has them

14:02.980 --> 14:03.980
all hanged.

14:03.980 --> 14:09.540
And this one suitor, Melanthius, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose

14:09.540 --> 14:14.720
and feet and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.

14:14.720 --> 14:19.980
Reading this, I guess I find myself asking, uh, was this really necessary?

14:19.980 --> 14:24.440
Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is, maybe workshop this?

14:24.440 --> 14:26.920
I mean, super unlikable protagonist.

14:26.920 --> 14:27.920
Really kind of kills it for me.

14:27.920 --> 14:32.100
I guess it's a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable because

14:32.100 --> 14:33.760
men love hearing about assholes.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.480
That's why they watch my channel.

14:35.480 --> 14:39.920
But the crazy thing is, I don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.

14:39.920 --> 14:44.700
The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors and to his, uh, men.

14:44.720 --> 14:46.380
His slaves.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.380
Yikes.

14:47.380 --> 14:48.380
Disappointing.

14:48.380 --> 14:51.480
Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves.

14:51.480 --> 14:53.040
It isn't a good look.

14:53.040 --> 14:54.040
Wow, this blew up.

14:54.040 --> 14:55.760
I don't have a sound cloud.

14:55.760 --> 14:56.760
Give me money.

14:56.760 --> 14:59.600
Oh my god, this contact is fully horizontal.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.900
This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts.

15:01.900 --> 15:02.900
Fuck this.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.160
It just seems disproportionate, you know?

15:04.160 --> 15:07.640
Like it's not even eye for an eye because the suitors didn't kill anyone.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.640
They were basically just rude to Odysseus.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.840
But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context.

15:13.840 --> 15:18.840
They came into his home, and they disrespected his wife, and probably she was into it, but

15:18.840 --> 15:20.180
whatever, we'll play along.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.700
So that was an affront to Odysseus's honor.

15:22.700 --> 15:28.420
And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.880
Because this was a pre-legal society.

15:30.880 --> 15:31.880
No laws.

15:31.880 --> 15:32.880
No courts.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.880
No cops.

15:33.880 --> 15:34.880
School's out.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.220
Fuck 12.

15:36.220 --> 15:40.040
So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.500
And that's what kept people from stealing and lying and murdering each other.

15:43.500 --> 15:47.160
Though it was also often the thing causing them to murder each other.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.820
Because back then, honor was the only thing protecting people from being taken advantage

15:50.820 --> 15:51.820
of.

15:51.820 --> 15:55.260
If you're an ancient Mycenaean king, and someone invites themselves into your house

15:55.260 --> 16:00.340
and drinks your wine and seduces your wife, well you can't let them get away with that.

16:00.340 --> 16:02.280
Because then people will walk all over you.

16:02.280 --> 16:06.960
So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person

16:06.960 --> 16:08.380
who is not to be messed with.

16:08.380 --> 16:12.120
It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.400
Hard masculinity is a defense.

16:13.400 --> 16:16.840
It's a defensive posture, an intimidating posture.

16:16.840 --> 16:20.260
It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.

16:20.260 --> 16:25.900
We call it toxic masculinity now, because in our society, it's destructive and dysfunctional.

16:25.900 --> 16:29.160
We've moved beyond the need for this, which is why it's possible for me to exist.

16:29.160 --> 16:33.940
If society collapses and we go back to Achilles and Odysseus, I'm in danger.

16:33.940 --> 16:36.800
I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.

16:36.800 --> 16:41.720
Back in Homer's time, I'd be, well, I'd be a slave at Femboy's symposium.

16:41.720 --> 16:42.720
Extremely sad gay sounds.

16:42.720 --> 16:43.720
Meow.

16:43.720 --> 16:49.020
But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not

16:49.020 --> 16:54.840
an option, such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands, or gangsters who need to resolve

16:54.840 --> 17:01.180
conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function.

17:01.180 --> 17:06.420
It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake.

17:06.420 --> 17:09.160
And the poison is vengeance.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.160
Justice served.

17:10.160 --> 17:11.720
So, revenge is arguably the most basic form of revenge.

17:11.720 --> 17:12.720
It's the most basic form of revenge.

17:12.720 --> 17:14.780
It's the most basic form of retributive justice.

17:14.780 --> 17:19.960
The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a wild justice, according to the first

17:19.960 --> 17:22.720
paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge.

17:22.720 --> 17:23.720
Research.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.480
I am very smart, meow.

17:25.480 --> 17:30.820
But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.

17:30.820 --> 17:34.640
An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn't you know that?

17:34.640 --> 17:39.480
If someone harms you, and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is gonna try

17:39.480 --> 17:40.720
to get revenge by killing you.

17:40.720 --> 17:41.720
It's a cycle.

17:41.720 --> 17:44.220
A cycle of smashing.

17:44.220 --> 17:48.720
At the end of the Odyssey, the families of the suitors Odysseus killed band together and

17:48.720 --> 17:51.320
plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.

17:51.320 --> 17:55.360
And literally the last thing that happens in the Odyssey is that the goddess Athena,

17:55.360 --> 18:01.520
who has an inexplicable ladyboner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him by… just… making

18:01.520 --> 18:04.760
the families forget that Odysseus killed their children.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.720
So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence.

18:08.720 --> 18:11.720
But in reality, that doesn't happen very much.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.720
So these cycles can last for decades or even centuries.

18:14.720 --> 18:19.540
In Albania, there's an ancient code called the Canon, which requires a family to commit

18:19.540 --> 18:23.620
murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them.

18:23.620 --> 18:25.640
Life for life, blood for blood.

18:25.640 --> 18:30.420
This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations,

18:30.420 --> 18:33.720
and in fact it still sometimes happens in parts of northern Albania.

18:33.720 --> 18:38.320
There's documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the

18:38.320 --> 18:40.720
rest of their lives, because there's a vendetta against them.

18:40.720 --> 18:41.720
And if they leave, they're dead.

18:41.720 --> 18:43.720
If they leave the house, they'll be murdered.

18:43.720 --> 18:48.660
Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed

18:48.660 --> 18:52.520
to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins.

18:52.520 --> 18:56.380
These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange

18:56.380 --> 18:58.060
for getting to live as men.

18:58.060 --> 19:01.980
There's still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society they're socially

19:01.980 --> 19:06.520
recognized as men, allowed to wear men's clothes, use a male name uwu, act as head

19:06.520 --> 19:10.920
of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges of

19:10.920 --> 19:11.520
a man.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.980
They're extremely happy trans sounds uwu.

19:13.980 --> 19:18.220
I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must have

19:18.220 --> 19:22.720
been, because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to

19:22.720 --> 19:24.320
support trans rights.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.960
No one wants that, so you know it was a last resort.

19:26.960 --> 19:30.720
Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender, most were compelled to revenge in the family.

19:30.720 --> 19:33.900
Yeah, I know that, Sweaty, it was just a joke, okay, calm down.

19:33.900 --> 19:38.720
Revenge cycles also happen on a larger scale, between communities, nations, ethnicities,

19:38.720 --> 19:39.720
and religions.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.720
I'm worried if I give a real example.

19:40.720 --> 19:45.720
I'll be canceled for seeming neutral about a conflict where I'm supposed to take a

19:45.720 --> 19:46.720
side.

19:46.720 --> 19:53.720
So, in the interest of cowardice, let's say that the cat girls bombed the dog girls,

19:53.720 --> 19:58.720
and then the dog girls bombed the cat girls, and that cycle repeats for a few decades,

19:58.720 --> 20:03.420
and by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter list of grievances against

20:03.420 --> 20:06.720
each other that reconciliation is close to impossible.

20:06.720 --> 20:09.920
Extremely angry gay sounds, nyah.

20:09.920 --> 20:13.920
So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system.

20:13.920 --> 20:18.200
It's bloody, it's chaotic, and it produces these endless cycles of violence.

20:18.200 --> 20:22.940
So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos

20:22.940 --> 20:23.940
caused by vengeance.

20:23.940 --> 20:28.920
And the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal system.

20:28.920 --> 20:29.920
2.

20:29.920 --> 20:32.760
Retribution The extremely heckin' cute and valid German

20:32.760 --> 20:39.320
sociologist Max Weber defined the state as the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate

20:39.320 --> 20:39.920
use of violence.

20:39.920 --> 20:45.560
In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long

20:45.560 --> 20:48.080
as they do so in accordance with the code of honor.

20:48.080 --> 20:52.360
But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people.

20:52.360 --> 20:56.520
In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law

20:56.520 --> 21:03.700
codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as history times.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.920
The code of Hammurabi looked like this.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.920
The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some...

21:08.920 --> 21:09.920
...

21:09.920 --> 21:11.920
...primitive attempt at writing.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.920
I mean, it was like a thousand years ago, so I'm sure they were doing their best.

21:15.920 --> 21:17.920
It's very good, sweetie.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.920
I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
I was expecting this replica to be bigger.

21:21.920 --> 21:25.920
Sort of a Spinal Tap Stonehenge situation.

21:25.920 --> 21:31.420
The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall, and they were publicly placed in

21:31.420 --> 21:35.920
the city so that everyone knew what the laws were, even though most people were illiterate.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.920
But hey, they tried, sort of.

21:37.920 --> 21:38.920
Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.

21:38.920 --> 21:39.920
That's content, right?

21:39.920 --> 21:42.920
Cat girl reacts to the code of Hammurabi.

21:42.920 --> 21:46.920
Nyas queen.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.920
We don't deserve rights.

21:48.920 --> 21:53.920
So there's 282 laws, and they're all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment

21:53.920 --> 21:54.920
is Y.

21:54.920 --> 21:59.920
Law 22, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.

21:59.920 --> 22:00.920
That's extremely valid.

22:00.920 --> 22:05.920
If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother, you are not

22:05.920 --> 22:06.920
my father or my mother, his tongue shall be cut off.

22:06.920 --> 22:07.920
That's extremely valid.

22:07.920 --> 22:08.920
His tongue shall be cut off.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.920
At least they're standing up for adoptive parents.

22:10.920 --> 22:15.920
If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.920
Now we're getting into some of the classics.

22:17.920 --> 22:20.920
If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.

22:20.920 --> 22:26.920
If a freedman strike the body of another freedman, he shall pay ten shekels in money.

22:26.920 --> 22:32.920
But if the slave of a freedman strike the body of a freedman, his ear shall be cut off.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.920
Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.

22:35.920 --> 22:37.920
So it's like our legal system except honest.

22:37.920 --> 22:42.520
If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house

22:42.520 --> 22:46.920
which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.

22:46.920 --> 22:51.920
If it kill the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death.

22:51.920 --> 22:52.920
Love that.

22:52.920 --> 22:57.920
Okay, so by modern standards, the Code of Hammurabi does not pass the vibe check.

22:57.920 --> 22:59.920
The vibrations are very negative.

22:59.920 --> 23:02.920
It's a lot of cutting people's hands off and burning them alive.

23:02.920 --> 23:03.920
Just a major vibe killer all around.

23:03.920 --> 23:04.920
But you have to credit Hammurabi.

23:04.920 --> 23:09.920
But you have to credit Hammurabi's Code for resolving the problem of honor-driven revenge cycles.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.320
You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against

23:14.320 --> 23:19.960
their family and potentially starting a generations-long blood feud, you take your grievance to the

23:19.960 --> 23:24.580
elders of the city, who reach a verdict and impose a sentence, justice served.

23:24.580 --> 23:28.840
So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante

23:28.840 --> 23:32.520
revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice.

23:32.520 --> 23:34.360
Let's list all the differences.

23:34.360 --> 23:38.180
Revenge is personal, in the sense that it's the victim who does the avenging.

23:38.180 --> 23:40.720
It's often emotional, an act of passion.

23:40.720 --> 23:45.960
It can be disproportionate, as in Odysseus killing the suitors for squatting in his palace.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.280
And it's sadistic.

23:47.280 --> 23:49.460
It's satisfying to the avenger.

23:49.460 --> 23:50.460
Revenge is sweet.

23:50.460 --> 23:55.100
On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal, in the sense that the

23:55.100 --> 23:59.140
punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim.

23:59.140 --> 24:04.240
It's therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion, and also lacking the

24:04.240 --> 24:06.320
sadism of sweet revenge.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.360
It's also proportionate, again in theory.

24:09.360 --> 24:13.860
You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it's an eye for an eye and no more than

24:13.860 --> 24:18.860
an eye, and that could be considered humane compared to, say, revenge killing someone's

24:18.860 --> 24:20.180
family for an eye.

24:20.180 --> 24:24.800
And it's also consistent, so different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for

24:24.800 --> 24:25.800
the same crime.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.360
I mean, unless you're rich, in which case, don't you even worry your little head about

24:29.360 --> 24:30.560
it, just pay some gold.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.560
It's fine.

24:31.560 --> 24:32.560
Girl, these contacts?

24:32.560 --> 24:33.560
Like…

24:34.240 --> 24:39.860
So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice, which

24:39.860 --> 24:45.060
is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw punisher.

24:45.060 --> 24:50.860
Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal, while rejecting revenge as lawless.

24:50.860 --> 24:58.500
However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge.

24:58.500 --> 25:03.020
It scratches the same emotional itch, it's basically revenge by proxy.

25:03.020 --> 25:04.020
If revenge is wild, then it's revenge by proxy.

25:04.020 --> 25:05.100
If there's injustice, then just don't even bother with that.

25:05.100 --> 25:08.760
If there's injustice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.

25:08.760 --> 25:13.740
In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out

25:13.740 --> 25:19.840
the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of

25:19.840 --> 25:20.840
way.

25:20.840 --> 25:25.320
Like in The Code of Hammurabi, there's this symbolic retaliation of punishing the

25:25.320 --> 25:27.740
body part that you've offended with.

25:27.740 --> 25:31.620
Cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the breast of the wet nurse who

25:31.620 --> 25:33.140
switched the babies.

25:33.140 --> 25:33.960
Cutting out the tongue that struck the father, cutting off the breast of the wet nurse who switched the babies.

25:34.020 --> 25:40.180
renounced its parents. There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation for the symmetry

25:40.180 --> 25:45.780
of punishment and crime. For a modern example, here's a poetic justice post from r slash instant

25:45.780 --> 25:51.700
karma. Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots online and then demands payment to take them down. The

25:51.700 --> 25:56.660
site's founders were just arrested for extortion. Here are their mugshots. There's something

25:56.660 --> 26:03.220
metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful cosmic harmony. And my guess is

26:03.220 --> 26:08.180
that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct that's difficult to get

26:08.180 --> 26:13.940
rid of. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it. The logic of retribution has been questioned

26:13.940 --> 26:21.860
for thousands of years by philosophers, reformists, messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they're

26:21.860 --> 26:27.220
too good to enjoy violence. One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the

26:27.220 --> 26:33.060
love and forgiveness school. And the main love and forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have

26:33.060 --> 26:33.200
heard of. I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's a school of anti-retribution thought.

26:33.200 --> 26:33.600
I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's a school of anti-retribution thought.

26:33.600 --> 26:39.520
Called Jesus of Nazareth. Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were

26:39.520 --> 26:44.960
similar to the Code of Hammurabi. Like in the Book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses,

26:44.960 --> 26:50.640
including some relaunches of Hammurabi classics. Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to

26:50.640 --> 26:56.560
Exodus 21-22. If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely,

26:56.560 --> 27:01.040
but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband

27:01.040 --> 27:03.040
demands and the court allows. But if there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever

27:03.040 --> 27:05.200
the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take

27:05.200 --> 27:12.160
life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for

27:12.160 --> 27:19.600
wound, bruise for bruise, head pats for head pats. Welcome to Catgirl Bible Study, Neil. Extremely

27:19.600 --> 27:26.080
devotional gay sound, Zulu. I feel very spiritually aroused right now. My third eye chakra? Dripping.

27:26.080 --> 27:32.880
Macaroni in a pot. I need Jesus. I'm so sorry. So the law of Moses is pretty

27:32.880 --> 27:40.400
based and uncucked. It's basically an eye for an eye, don't be a homo, you know, basic common sense.

27:40.400 --> 27:45.360
But then Jesus comes along and he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness. In Matthew

27:45.360 --> 27:53.280
26-52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays him, but Jesus says,

27:53.280 --> 27:58.240
Put your sword back in its place, Spartacus. All who draw the sword will die by the sword.

27:58.240 --> 28:02.720
Now some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced.

28:02.720 --> 28:07.200
Even to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism.

28:07.200 --> 28:13.120
Denying the right of marginalized people to defend themselves? Rethink this. It gets worse.

28:13.120 --> 28:19.200
In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.

28:19.200 --> 28:26.400
Love your enemies? But I don't want to love my enemies. No loving. Smashing. But maybe Jesus wasn't

28:26.400 --> 28:31.840
as literal-minded as that. You know, religion is a very subjective thing, and I have my own Bible

28:32.720 --> 28:40.560
versions, and my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm.

28:40.560 --> 28:46.080
Like, consider Matthew 5-38. Why is no one talking about Matthew 5-38? Jesus says,

28:46.080 --> 28:50.800
You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you,

28:50.800 --> 28:55.920
Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.

28:56.480 --> 29:02.320
Think of the drama of what he's asking you to do here. Someone strikes you across the face and you

29:02.720 --> 29:11.120
say, Ugh. This is not pacifism. This is passive aggression. Some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.

29:11.120 --> 29:19.440
This is the Christianity of, Okay, well, I'll pray for you. But if you do take Jesus at face value,

29:19.440 --> 29:24.800
then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response to wrongdoing

29:24.800 --> 29:32.400
is not justice at all. It's an alternative to justice. In the absence of justice, forgiveness,

29:32.720 --> 29:39.600
is an emotional unburdening of the resentment and anger that victims of injustice experience.

29:39.600 --> 29:44.720
And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about

29:44.720 --> 29:50.320
serving earthly justice, because justice is really God's business, and he'll take care of that when

29:50.320 --> 29:55.520
the day of judgment comes. It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism, there's the idea of

29:55.520 --> 30:02.160
karma, which is like a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or

30:02.160 --> 30:02.720
human instinct. It's like a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human instinct.

30:02.720 --> 30:03.600
It's like a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human instinct.

30:03.600 --> 30:08.800
You reap what you sow, basically, so maybe don't worry about injustice too much, because

30:09.360 --> 30:14.400
karma will take care of it. This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just world fallacy,

30:14.400 --> 30:19.520
the cognitive bias that sees the world as inherently fair and good. Everything happens

30:19.520 --> 30:25.120
for a reason. If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say,

30:25.120 --> 30:29.360
there's a special place in God's kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.160
And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being

30:32.160 --> 30:37.520
anally demolished by fire demons or whatever. People reassure themselves like this because it

30:37.520 --> 30:43.760
relieves the stress of enduring unresolved injustice. In the Bible, the book of Job

30:43.760 --> 30:49.680
deals with the problem of injustice. Why do bad things happen to good people? And the answer is,

30:49.680 --> 30:54.720
just don't worry about it. It's part of God's plan. It'll all work out in the end. It's fine.

30:54.720 --> 31:00.480
Everything's fine. The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of

31:00.480 --> 31:06.560
very not good. In which case, you might start getting ideas in your head about,

31:07.360 --> 31:09.440
I don't know, maybe changing some things.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.600
I guess I should disclaimer that hashtag not all religion, and obviously many political

31:13.600 --> 31:18.480
activists have been influenced by faith, but let's put a pin in that for now.

31:18.480 --> 31:20.640
3. Utilitarianism

31:20.640 --> 31:24.880
So there's also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking,

31:24.880 --> 31:30.400
which tries to define justice as something other than retaliation. Utilitarian

31:30.480 --> 31:36.080
reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve society,

31:36.080 --> 31:41.040
rather than punishment for punishment's sake. Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says

31:41.040 --> 31:46.160
that the right thing to do is whatever causes the highest ratio of human happiness to human

31:46.160 --> 31:51.200
suffering. So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future

31:51.200 --> 31:56.560
crimes, where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.920
Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence,

31:59.920 --> 32:00.400
punishment for crimes, and punishment for crimes. Some utilitarian punishment goals might be,

32:00.400 --> 32:06.080
criminals as an incentive for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons,

32:06.080 --> 32:11.600
or rehabilitation of criminals, trying to educate or discipline them so that they can reenter society.

32:11.600 --> 32:16.240
A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than

32:16.240 --> 32:22.720
retribution, which is very based in emotions. Also, the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense,

32:22.720 --> 32:27.200
even if you don't believe in free will. Because retribution really only makes sense if you

32:27.200 --> 32:29.840
believe that people freely choose their actions,

32:29.840 --> 32:34.880
and are therefore culpable for their behavior, and can be deserving of punishment.

32:34.880 --> 32:39.680
Because punishing someone for something they didn't meaningfully choose seems, well...

32:39.680 --> 32:45.440
The Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian king Xerxes ordering the sea to be

32:45.440 --> 32:51.360
whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge. Which seems irrational, right?

32:51.360 --> 32:53.120
To punish a force of nature?

32:53.120 --> 32:55.280
Leave my beautiful wet wife alone!

32:55.280 --> 32:59.280
It's debatable how free humans are, like we're at least partially product,

32:59.280 --> 33:06.000
but we're actually products of our genetics, our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house,

33:06.000 --> 33:10.880
the placement of Venus in our natal chart, dry, oilier combination.

33:10.880 --> 33:14.800
And modern criminal sentencing tries to take all of that into consideration.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.880
Like you might get a lighter sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never took

33:18.880 --> 33:23.920
you to Disneyland, it was a crime of passion, through no fault of my own I was high on bath

33:23.920 --> 33:28.400
salts at the time of the tax evasion, your honor. A lot of the language around punishment in our

33:28.400 --> 33:29.200
legal system is utilitarian.

33:29.280 --> 33:34.880
Like, prisons are called correctional facilities, not retribution cages.

33:34.880 --> 33:38.480
But correctional facilities is a euphemism, because the fact is,

33:39.120 --> 33:42.800
these facilities are not doing very much correcting. I'm sorry.

33:42.800 --> 33:47.520
In the United States, two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested within three years,

33:47.520 --> 33:51.120
and 76% are re-arrested within five years.

33:51.120 --> 33:54.240
And just think about the way we talk about incarceration.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.200
Like if someone really evil gets a long sentence, we say,

33:57.200 --> 33:59.120
Good! I hope he rots in prison!

33:59.280 --> 34:03.280
Like, when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said,

34:03.280 --> 34:08.400
Good! The proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and

34:08.400 --> 34:11.040
release him a contributing member of his community.

34:11.040 --> 34:16.240
So even the institutions we have that are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative function

34:16.240 --> 34:19.760
are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.

34:19.760 --> 34:23.760
I think the problem with utilitarianism is that, while it's very rational,

34:24.400 --> 34:27.840
it's often offensive to human emotions.

34:27.840 --> 34:29.120
And you can say facts don't care about you.

34:29.120 --> 34:34.400
We shouldn't be basing our legal system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind.

34:34.960 --> 34:36.080
And I agree with you.

34:36.080 --> 34:41.040
But the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don't want to rehabilitate him.

34:41.040 --> 34:42.560
You want to set him on fire.

34:42.560 --> 34:47.680
And this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion affects law enforcement too.

34:47.680 --> 34:52.480
A YouTuber called Jose has a video called Why Some Cops Think They're the Punisher,

34:52.480 --> 34:56.000
which argues that some cops and soldiers admire the Punisher

34:56.000 --> 34:58.640
because they relate to his military background while

34:59.120 --> 35:03.040
criticizing about the moral simplicity of his vigilantism.

35:03.040 --> 35:07.200
Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans who say things like,

35:07.200 --> 35:12.160
Castle doesn't see shades of grey, which, unfortunately, the American justice system

35:12.160 --> 35:16.000
is littered with and which tends to slow down and sometimes even hinder

35:16.000 --> 35:18.960
victims of crime from getting the justice they deserve.

35:18.960 --> 35:22.960
Frank Castle is the ultimate definition of Occam's razor for the military.

35:22.960 --> 35:26.960
Don't worry about uniforms, inspections, or restrictive rules of engagement.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.000
Find the bad guys.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.960
Kill the bad guys.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.560
Protect the innocent.

35:30.560 --> 35:31.840
Any true warrior?

35:31.840 --> 35:32.960
That's the dream.

35:32.960 --> 35:38.640
So these cops and soldiers feel cramped by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions

35:38.640 --> 35:42.080
that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.

35:42.080 --> 35:47.600
You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier if it weren't for all these pesky laws.

35:47.600 --> 35:52.320
There's a childish simplicity and dualism to this moral worldview.

35:52.320 --> 35:53.680
Find the bad guys.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.040
Kill the bad guys.

35:55.040 --> 35:58.640
Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric about how you need a good

35:58.640 --> 36:02.160
guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.880
There's only 8 year old boys playing cops and robbers.

36:04.880 --> 36:09.420
Good guys and bad guys.

36:09.420 --> 36:12.080
That's my impression of an 8 year old boy.

36:12.080 --> 36:15.780
And to be fair, I totally understand the appeal of moral simplicity.

36:15.780 --> 36:19.760
People love justice-served and instant karma videos for a reason.

36:19.760 --> 36:24.460
We take satisfaction in swift, decisive, elegant retribution.

36:24.460 --> 36:28.240
But the procedures of law enforcement and criminal justice don't allow us.

36:28.240 --> 36:33.200
allow for that. There's all these tedious roadblocks. Right to an attorney. Right to remain

36:33.200 --> 36:38.080
silent. Right to a fair trial. Presumption of innocence. A lot of police wish they could

36:38.080 --> 36:42.720
simplify things by being judge, jury, and executioner. But the function of police is

36:42.720 --> 36:47.760
supposed to be limited to making arrests and initiating criminal investigations. They're not

36:47.760 --> 36:53.680
supposed to be walking avatars of karma dispensing free-form retribution in the streets at will,

36:53.680 --> 36:59.040
justice served, now with 20% more police brutality. But a lot of people defend the police

36:59.040 --> 37:04.080
when they behave like this, because the thin-wristed civilians are just as emotionally

37:04.080 --> 37:09.040
frustrated by due process as the cops. Wow, did I just say all lives are bastards?

37:09.760 --> 37:14.480
I'm double cancelled. Well look, all lives are bastards. But only some bastards are armed by

37:14.480 --> 37:18.880
the state and licensed to go bastarding around town. The rest of us have to be

37:18.880 --> 37:23.520
bastards on our off time. I also think there's a secular version of the just world fallacy

37:23.680 --> 37:28.720
going on here. People like to think that if the police kill somebody, it must be because

37:28.720 --> 37:34.880
that person did something wrong. Karma at work, justice served. Victim-blaming is an expression

37:34.880 --> 37:40.560
of the just world fallacy. You get what you deserve, so if something bad happens to you,

37:40.560 --> 37:44.720
you must have been asking for it. And obviously racism is a huge part of this. You know,

37:44.720 --> 37:49.280
there's structural white supremacy that occupies black neighborhoods with police instead of

37:49.280 --> 37:53.600
investing in communities. And people are prejudiced and more likely to think of black people as

37:53.600 --> 37:53.660
people with disabilities. And I think that's a huge part of this. You know, there's structural white supremacy that occupies black neighborhoods with police instead of investing in communities. And people are prejudiced and more likely to think of black people as

37:53.660 --> 37:58.940
criminal thugs and therefore deserving of police violence. So we get this no angel discourse that

37:58.940 --> 38:03.340
comes up every time a black person is murdered by the police, where they bring up the victim's

38:03.340 --> 38:08.300
criminal record or a picture of them looking like a scary thug, as if that proves they deserved to

38:08.300 --> 38:14.540
die. The problem with this, of course, is that no one is an angel. There are no angels walking

38:14.540 --> 38:19.340
this earth. We're all flawed. We've all made mistakes. We've all done bad things. That doesn't

38:19.340 --> 38:23.580
mean we deserve to die a violent death. And then there's people like Breonna Taylor

38:23.580 --> 38:28.300
and Elijah McClain, who, as far as we know, were about as close to angels as humans come,

38:28.300 --> 38:33.900
but that didn't protect them. So that is 100% beside the point, because black people in America

38:33.900 --> 38:38.540
should not literally have to have white feather wings and glowing halos to deserve not to be

38:38.540 --> 38:43.260
murdered by the police. In fact, people of all races have the absolute right to be low-life,

38:43.260 --> 38:48.300
drug-addicted, petty criminals who contribute absolutely nothing to society and yet still not be

38:48.300 --> 38:53.260
executed by the cops because that's what it's supposed to mean to live in a free country. So,

38:53.260 --> 38:57.500
things need to change. The Punisher police have got to go, and a lot of the rest of our justice

38:57.500 --> 39:03.180
system with them. We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice and, to be honest, that might

39:03.180 --> 39:06.780
take more than one YouTube video. I know at the beginning I said I was going to explain what

39:06.780 --> 39:16.860
justice is, but um, I lied. I'm sorry that I can't fix America. I'm just a lonely cat. I guess the

39:16.860 --> 39:23.100
only solution is revolution. And by revolution I do mean to vote Democrat and then bully the Democrats into

39:23.100 --> 39:28.300
actually doing something. And if they don't listen, well...

39:31.020 --> 39:31.980
Hang on, let me get this.

39:35.420 --> 39:38.460
Moshi moshi! Hey, how are you, Jace?

39:53.100 --> 39:55.580
arenthood, right?

39:55.580 --> 40:01.180
