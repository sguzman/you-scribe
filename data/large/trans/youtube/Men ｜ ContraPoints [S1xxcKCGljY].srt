1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,960
Hi boys, it's me again.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:08,960
Just your average girl.

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,160
Look, I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video we're able

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,920
to converse as men.

5
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:21,320
I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between

6
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,160
now and the decline of Rome.

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,500
Do you like history boys?

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,960
How did Rome fall again?

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,800
Was it the gays?

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,220
Tell me all about it.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:34,220
Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side, and men's

12
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:36,080
rights activists on the other.

13
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:37,080
Whatever happened to that?

14
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:42,460
These days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.

15
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,220
I did want to do the fedora though.

16
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:48,540
Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora, and I

17
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,460
wanted to put my own little twist on it.

18
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:56,620
My wardrobe notes for this video say, MRA femme fatale and fedora but make it fashion.

19
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:57,620
School shooter realness.

20
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:59,180
I feel like I'm also serving a little…

21
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,140
Oh.

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,580
Red-pilled Carmen Sandiego.

23
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:08,660
In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?

24
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:16,200
Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.

25
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,500
Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting

26
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,800
in a state of psychological balance?

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,140
Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?

28
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:27,180
I guess yeah, kind of.

29
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,180
You don't see a whole lot of psyllium hustling.

30
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,180
I'm not sure.

31
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,180
I'm not sure.

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,180
I'm not sure.

33
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,180
I don't think I'm going to be a big fan of the trans-heterosexual medicine cabinets.

34
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,180
I'm losing my target audience here.

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,740
Listen, my dudes, let's just say, I'm kind of worried about you guys.

36
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,760
And I'm not saying I'm any better.

37
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,820
To be clear, I'm not okay either.

38
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,360
There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.

39
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:47,140
Yeah, that's right, women pee too, okay?

40
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
Get over it.

41
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,680
I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I, for one, will

42
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:56,140
not be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.

43
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:57,140
Oh.

44
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,140
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,140
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,100
You boys, you're very rational, aren't you?

47
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,260
Ugh, I suppose I was too.

48
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:08,100
I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with,

49
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:11,140
both as a biological female and as a Pisces moon.

50
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,700
But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men,

51
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,780
Contra Pines, for men,

52
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,740
I started brushing up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.

53
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,340
So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica,

54
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,580
Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,

55
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:33,060
and of course, the philosophical classic The Rational Male by Royal Caliente.

56
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,900
So my mind is well lubricated and I am ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating,

57
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:42,420
intellectual… interchange.

58
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,740
Look, I want to play by your rules, okay?

59
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,300
So there will be no emotions in this video.

60
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:50,420
I will present my arguments in strict, logical form,

61
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,820
relying only on facts, reason, evidence, and deductive proof.

62
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
So let's get to it.

63
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:12,260
Actually, you know what, fuck that, let's listen to house music and do sex shrugs.

64
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,420
I'm pandering to the male gaze.

65
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,780
Oh, and the male's traits.

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,620
God, I love attention.

67
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,660
Hey, gorge.

68
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,020
Hey, gorge.

69
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,100
Hey, gorge.

70
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:38,820
Okay, I'm ready.

71
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,420
Let's crack open a cold one, boys.

72
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,980
My hands are too pretty to open the can.

73
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,820
I need a man to do it for me.

74
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,620
Help!

75
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,020
Fuck it.

76
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,940
Okay, that's super fucking pretty.

77
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,740
Hey, gorge.

78
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,540
Hey, gorge.

79
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,180
Are there any women?

80
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,860
Women still watching this video?

81
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:01,860
I'm really sorry about all this, unless you're into that sort of thing.

82
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,540
In which case, how very dare.

83
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,980
I'm a good Presbyterian.

84
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,300
And by Presbyterian, I do mean pansexual.

85
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,100
Hey, how are y'all?

86
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,380
Look, the video's about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.

87
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,300
Am I doing this right?

88
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,580
Is this what men like?

89
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,380
Traps.

90
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,580
Straps.

91
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,260
It is a risky look for a girl like me.

92
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,820
When you do a lingerie look, you know you're going to wind up somewhere

93
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:23,780
on the frankenfurter violet tchotchke didevantese spectrum?

94
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,940
Oh, but you don't know where exactly.

95
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,820
And that is a dangerous game, ladies.

96
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,380
I have to say, though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now.

97
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,620
But, um, that could be because of the drugs.

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:40,580
Look, gentlemen, let's be rational.

99
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,420
And we're fooling around, okay?

100
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,060
Part one.

101
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,420
Oh, wait.

102
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,420
Rational.

103
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,380
Axiom one.

104
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,620
America's next top victim.

105
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:55,220
I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture.

106
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,100
And I'm not just talking...

107
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,220
about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.

108
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,020
No, bitch.

109
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,460
This goes all the way to the top.

110
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,740
We have white people complaining about reverse racism.

111
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:11,220
We have the literal 1% complaining about ANTI-RAGE PREJUDICE.

112
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,900
That must be super fucking hard for you.

113
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,060
We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.

114
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,700
You know, flaunting their sexuality in the faces of children who are trying to raise a family,

115
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,780
and protesting in the street like a bunch of .

116
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,580
And so, of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights too.

117
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,220
I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life,

118
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,380
and I've always been very skeptical.

119
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:40,500
Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.

120
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,620
Women try to do a good thing to solve a real problem,

121
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,460
and then a man shows up to say,

122
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,060
Well, what about men?

123
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,580
Men also get harassed.

124
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,580
Why aren't you talking about men?

125
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:55,220
And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?

126
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,380
Of course he's fucking not.

127
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,900
He doesn't give a shit.

128
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,100
He's a troll.

129
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:05,140
His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?

130
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,340
What about them, honey?

131
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,220
For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once.

132
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:13,380
And the first thing I did was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement,

133
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,020
which is the Myth of Male Power by Warren Farrell.

134
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,260
Actually, I listened to the audiobook because, let's be honest, reading is hard.

135
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,900
But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it to.

136
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:30,100
Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender role

137
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,260
that confined women to domestic servitude.

138
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:37,940
But he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society is actually an illusion,

139
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,620
because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.

140
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:44,420
He introduces the idea of male disposability,

141
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:49,300
basically the idea that society values female lives more than male lives,

142
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,180
which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting and providing for women and children.

143
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,140
And he points to statistics,

144
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,420
showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,

145
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,780
workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.

146
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,220
So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power than women,

147
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,980
in fact, the queens have a certain kind of privilege

148
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,860
in being protected and provided for by the expendable male worker bees.

149
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:18,180
And I guess that kind of makes sense.

150
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:21,060
I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.

151
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,860
What I'm saying is, I took the red pill,

152
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,060
and I rubbed it on my clitoris,

153
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,020
and I rubbed it on my chest,

154
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,060
and I rubbed it on my chest, and I rubbed it on my chest,

155
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:27,620
and I rubbed it on my chest, and I rubbed it on my chest,

156
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,260
but some initial objections come to mind.

157
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,140
Like, haven't men been almost all of the kings, presidents, and CEOs for millennia?

158
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,700
Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?

159
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,740
I don't know, boys.

160
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,300
Still seems kind of patriarchal to me.

161
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,980
But maybe you'll say that it's only at the top of society that men have more power than women.

162
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:53,140
Maybe the average man is also oppressed by the system that feminists call patriarchy.

163
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:54,420
If that's what you're saying,

164
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,620
I think I basically agree with that.

165
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:02,100
See, what you have to understand about me is I am such a fucking Libra.

166
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,740
Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,

167
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:08,580
well, maybe everybody's right, and maybe there's good points on both sides,

168
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:13,620
and we should all just listen to each other and rub each other's cluuuuts.

169
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,140
But no, my Scorpio rising persona will not allow that.

170
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,300
Oh, there will be a champion.

171
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,660
There will be blood.

172
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,740
So, judges.

173
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,900
How do we decide which gender is American?

174
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
And who's America's next top victim?

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:32,260
I mean, it's not like you can just change genders and see how the other half lives.

176
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,180
Or can you?

177
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,700
Proposition two.

178
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,340
Diary of an X-man.

179
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:45,620
Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.

180
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:48,580
Mom, get out of my room.

181
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,020
You're ruining my life.

182
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:54,500
Look, I have never, ever talked about this on my channel before.

183
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,300
It's like a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.

184
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,220
But I was born a boy.

185
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,180
Well, was I ever really a boy?

186
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,300
It's hard to say.

187
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,580
Dear diary,

188
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:09,700
Growing up, I always knew that I was different from other kids, especially other boys.

189
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,900
And it took me so long to pinpoint what it was.

190
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,780
But there was this moment.

191
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,580
I must have been, what, seven, eight years old?

192
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,620
And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself.

193
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,020
And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

194
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,500
And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

195
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:24,820
And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

196
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,700
And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

197
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,380
And I don't know what it was.

198
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:30,740
It was like this magnetism that drew me to them.

199
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:34,260
And I put my little feet in them and walked in front of the mirror.

200
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:38,420
And I didn't really have the words yet to describe how I felt.

201
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:43,700
But basically, in that moment, I sensed that God had made a mistake.

202
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:48,740
And I was destined to be, to be a Crosstresser.

203
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:53,300
That is super fucking coconuts.

204
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,420
Anyway, then in my 20s, my life completely changed.

205
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,740
My life completely fell apart and I became a woman.

206
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,700
Hey, how are you?

207
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
I became one of the dolls.

208
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,380
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

209
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,860
Look, boys, the point I'm trying to make here is I used to live your lifestyle.

210
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,380
I know what people like you get up to.

211
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,140
And I think it's disgusting.

212
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:13,300
I gotta say, though, since I transitioned, my life has been super fucking great.

213
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,580
Like, way better.

214
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,660
Now, of course, a lot of that is not because women have it better than men, but because...

215
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:22,420
Hey, gorge, I am literally transgendered.

216
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,020
So before I transitioned, I was like, oh my god.

217
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,620
I was dying inside, you know?

218
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,220
I was in the wrong body.

219
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,500
And now, it's like I finally have the body I was meant to die inside of.

220
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,860
But it's not just that.

221
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:37,620
I do think that, in some ways, since I started presenting as a woman,

222
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,620
people actually do treat me better.

223
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:42,260
I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure.

224
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,980
But that's probably for the best.

225
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:48,260
Now, before using my personal experience as any kind of evidence,

226
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
I guess I should say a couple caveats.

227
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:54,020
Caveat one is that most pre-transition trans women are gay.

228
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,700
They're not like other boys.

229
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:00,100
And most of us, we're not living the business-class male experience by any means.

230
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,340
You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics,

231
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,860
tormented sissies, secretive transvestites,

232
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:09,700
poets, you know, that sort of thing.

233
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:15,140
Caveat two is that my trans experience is not THE trans experience.

234
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:19,380
And I do have a lot of other privileges that made things go super fucking well for me.

235
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,340
Hey, how are yo?

236
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:23,300
Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege in a way that's actually...

237
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,460
It's actually just bragging.

238
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,460
You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge that I've been so successful

239
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:34,820
and I've come so far in part because I'm white and I'm skinny and I'm young

240
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:40,340
and I'm blonde and I'm rich and I pass and I'm educated and I'm popular

241
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:44,340
and my plastic surgeon is an artist and my boyfriend is really rich and hot

242
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,500
and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.

243
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,700
And part of what makes me so enlightened and so compassionate

244
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,060
is that I'm able to recognize these privileges that I have

245
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:58,180
that just might not be available to people who are less fortunate.

246
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,660
From the bottom of my mother-fucking-at-my-father-fucking-heart

247
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,260
that must be super fucking hard for you, I can't even imagine.

248
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,380
What I was saying is there are ways that people treat me better now

249
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,820
that I'm presenting as a woman.

250
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,580
You know, people smile at me more.

251
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,580
I feel more taken care of.

252
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:14,500
Men do things for me.

253
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,380
Now, a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,

254
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,020
you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,

255
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:22,820
because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.

256
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,660
But not me.

257
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,860
I love it.

258
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,860
Both because I love attention and because I'm a recumbent queen

259
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,100
who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.

260
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,420
I do this thing on airplanes where when it's time for me

261
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,900
to put my carry-on luggage in the overhead bin,

262
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,100
I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift

263
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:43,220
and then some man will usually get up and do it for me

264
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:45,220
even though I'm taller than most men.

265
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:46,420
It makes me happy.

266
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:48,340
Another good thing about becoming a woman is

267
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,820
I integrated into female social groups

268
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
and I found that they provide a kind of

269
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,460
communal support and overt affection

270
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,420
that male social groups generally just don't.

271
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,700
I find that female social style suits me better than the male one

272
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,740
which tends to be more atomized, more individualist

273
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:09,860
where affection is always concealed behind this semi-jokey front of competition.

274
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,540
Like, think about the way boys talk to each other when they play video games.

275
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,300
A third improvement for me has to do with the way

276
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,780
men and women are treated in public space.

277
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,620
When you present female in public

278
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,220
you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle to be caught up in, so to speak, when you're screened as a zombie.

279
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:21,720
When you present a female in public, you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle, to be caught up in, and more often than not, an idol in front of a mirror.

280
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:27,980
spectacle to be commented upon. People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions about

281
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:34,060
you. Sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting, sometimes just fucking weird. Whereas, when

282
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:39,040
you present male in public, you're more likely to be treated either as invisible or as dangerous.

283
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:43,960
Now, feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences as men asserting dominance

284
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:49,000
over women in public space, and they've criticized catcalling as being objectifying, degrading,

285
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,640
and misogynistic. And it certainly can be all of those things. There's different kinds of

286
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:58,280
catcalling, and I have different feelings about them. If I'm walking with another woman, and a

287
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:04,340
man says, ladies, you look beautiful tonight. I don't know. I like that. I think that's nice.

288
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,420
It makes me feel seen. It makes me feel admired. It boosts my confidence. Whereas, if I'm walking

289
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:16,980
alone, and a drunk starts following me down the street, singing, have you seen a polythene Pam?

290
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,960
She's so good looking, what she looks like.

291
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,560
A man.

292
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:25,400
That, I am less enthusiastic about. I mean, not that that's ever happened.

293
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:28,300
I'm completely fucking unclockable, hey, how are you?

294
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,120
No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.

295
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:39,140
I definitely get where feminists are coming from, because street harassment sucks. I'm a lot more

296
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:44,260
afraid walking alone at night than I used to be, and there's a lot more places I just won't go by

297
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:48,980
myself. But on the other hand, I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night,

298
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,880
without other people acting afraid of me. I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine the ways

299
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:01,540
that being treated as invisible or dangerous can also kind of suck. In my video on incels,

300
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:07,480
I talked about male invisibility on dating apps, and how getting no attention at all can actually

301
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,160
be emotionally worse than getting a lot of shitty attention. And when it comes to being treated as

302
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,820
dangerous, when I was living as a man, sometimes if I was walking at night, a woman on the same

303
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,060
block as me would change sides of the street. And I totally get why. Men do scary shit sometimes,

304
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:31,540
and it's better to be safe. But it's still stung a little bit to be treated as dangerous by default.

305
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,820
I think it can actually be harmful, which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation. There's

306
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:41,920
ways that white women's fear can actually be dangerous, in particular to black men.

307
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,640
I had an experience with this recently when I was filming my video The Apocalypse,

308
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,760
and I had rented a room in a hotel casino. Around midnight,

309
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,960
I was carrying some camera equipment up to my room, and I got into the elevator with a group

310
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:58,060
of people from the casino floor. A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator except for me,

311
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:03,520
and a single black man. Well, I mean, he was alone. I don't know if he was single. That's

312
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:07,720
not part of the story. And as soon as the door closed, he started literally whistling Row,

313
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:12,460
Row, Row Your Boat, the official melody of performative innocence. And I realized,

314
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:18,580
oh shit, he's afraid that I'm afraid. And I found that just excruciating. I was like,

315
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:25,240
oh god, how do other white women behave in elevators? Do they, like, clutch their purses?

316
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:32,200
Ugh, that's so foggy embarrassing. Nothing like that had ever happened to me when I was living

317
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:37,360
as a man. It's not a thing between black men and white men. It's a thing between black men

318
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,580
and white women. And so that dynamic was there, not just because I'm white and he's black, but

319
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,560
because I'm a woman and he's a man. And I thought of that incident again when I was listening to

320
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:54,340
it. And Farrell says, men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength, and women's greatest

321
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:59,440
strength is their facade of weakness. I think there is some truth to the idea that women's

322
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,840
perceived vulnerability can make them powerful, and men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.

323
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,560
Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt, because these are just some little

324
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:14,140
observations I've made based on a handful of anecdotes. And as rational males, it's important

325
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:18,380
that we consider the facts, the stats, and the figures. Did you know?

326
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:26,960
Did you know that 46% of men are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women? Look it up.

327
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:33,320
I haven't. I guess my super fucking Libra opinion is that there's upsides and downsides to male and

328
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,000
female experience. I don't actually think there's a single definite answer to the vague and useless

329
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:43,400
question, which gender has it worse? I consider myself a feminist because I support reproductive

330
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:48,320
rights and I oppose workplace misogyny, and I generally agree with a lot of the activism that

331
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:52,340
happens under the heading of feminism. But I also think a lot of men are just

332
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,360
having a super fucking difficult time right now, and that must be super fucking hard for them,

333
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,800
eh? How are you? And I don't think feminists have an obligation to care about male angst,

334
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,320
but I care about you boys. God, I'm such a cool girl, I think the entire mid-Atlantic

335
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,460
region is about to freeze over. No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon,

336
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:18,260
and I really try to understand other people's pain, because I just find it really, really funny.

337
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:25,640
I'm also really, really sobering up here. The drugs have worn off, and I'm suddenly feeling

338
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:32,420
very naked. Like, it's just now occurring to me that this is a highly inappropriate outfit for

339
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:38,240
this occasion. So, I'm gonna go put on a robe, and I'll meet you back for the next section.

340
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,840
Postulate 3. The Man Question.

341
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,320
Hi boys.

342
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,520
Et cetera, et cetera.

343
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,080
Hey, how are you?

344
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:57,140
For the last three years on this channel, I have been your Virgil, leading you through gender hell.

345
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,560
Pick-up artists, gender dysphoria, incels, radical feminists, non-binary genders,

346
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:09,200
men's rights activists. It seems like everybody's having gender trouble, so what do we make of that?

347
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,760
Well, Gorg, a very, very rational male philosopher named Hegel once said that the unfolding of

348
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,660
history is a

349
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,480
basically rational process, Gorg. That means that at any time in history, society is based

350
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:29,280
on certain principles, like, um, all men are created equal as long as they're super fucking

351
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,680
rich and white. And there's always contradictions within those principles, which creates tension

352
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,400
and eventually leads to a rupture, like a revolution, where society has to be reorganized

353
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,480
according to new principles. At least, I think he was saying something like that. It's pretty

354
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,800
hard to make anything out through the fog of his unreadable, hyper-abstract man-jabbing.

355
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:53,220
God, I can't stand that shit. Or any of the other music-hating vol-cells of the male philosophical

356
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,460
tradition. My point is, I think our society has reached a place where gender as we know

357
00:19:57,460 --> 00:20:01,920
it just isn't working anymore. Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working or how

358
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,920
to fix it, but we do all agree that it's broken. We have mainstream feminists saying we need

359
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,680
to continue advancing the rights of women. We have conservatives saying we need to restore

360
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:14,860
the gender roles of the 1950s. We have an increasing number of people not identifying

361
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,660
as men or women. We have TERFs saying we need to restore the gender roles of women. We have

362
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:19,980
transphobic TERFs who think that the transgenders are the single greatest threat to civilization,

363
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:24,080
hey, how are you? And we have men's rights activists saying we need a male equivalent

364
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,880
to feminism to liberate men from their oppressive gender role. Now, I want to focus on that

365
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,620
last one, because in principle, I agree. I've spent a lot of the last three years covering

366
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,960
the manosphere. I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me. And from all the time I've

367
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,900
tortured myself wading through these communities of incels, pick-up artists, men's rights slacktivists,

368
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
intellectual dark web fanboys, and anti-feminism activists, I've come to the conclusion that

369
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,420
I'm not the only one who thinks that the transgenders are the single greatest threat to civilization,

370
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:46,520
hey, how are you? And we have men's rights activists saying we need a male equivalent to feminism to liberate

371
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,080
men from their oppressive gender role. Now, I've spent a lot of the last three years On

372
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,780
the same planet world, somewhere in our own lives, some of those healthy species have

373
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:58,880
nothing to do with us or anything else, and all of our vakas and 1000s of racisms have

374
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,640
nothing to do with that mother24 and the others, but happens to be a lie to me. Yeah,

375
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,440
morph forests, freaking you guys and shit, bullshit. Yeah. But to at least identify who

376
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,700
long, crossedació this great opportunity of our funky moments because,

377
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:07,080
it all starts from up here, says Mike. And you lie to me, you mean七

378
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,440
And just to clarify, I'm not trying to take away your video games and pornography,

379
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,260
but I am not telling you what to do with your penis, you can rub one out once in a while

380
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,220
for this video for all I care–let's just move on.

381
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,220
ok?

382
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,280
Don't pull a GamerKeed on me, okay?

383
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,020
I live in fear.

384
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,500
Look, I like to believe that until the red pillars

385
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,280
inject their poison, most of these boys are not bad people.

386
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,080
I think all of this originates in a genuine crisis

387
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,240
of male identity, and I think it's happened

388
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,300
in something like the way men's rights activists describe.

389
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,820
The sacrificial role of men as warriors

390
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,280
is no longer widely glorified or necessary.

391
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,640
The traditional protector-provider role of men

392
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,820
is being replaced by a more equal

393
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,720
and undefined gender dynamic.

394
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,300
And college professors and activists are telling men

395
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,220
that most of our culture's aspirational representations

396
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,320
of manhood are toxic and bad.

397
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,400
But without an attractive replacement vision

398
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,420
of aspirational manhood, average young men

399
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:00,940
can only envision their future as what?

400
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,820
The beta, the cock, the new male.

401
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,340
And in a post-left-toop internet,

402
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,880
we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.

403
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,540
And to be fair, it is very funny.

404
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,420
But we forget,

405
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,920
especially us grills, that for a lot of men,

406
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,820
these words actually do tap into a deep existential angst.

407
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,200
And a lot of leftists go,

408
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,200
well, how can men be so angsty?

409
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,900
Especially white men, they're so privileged.

410
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,740
But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.

411
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,740
If you're actually being oppressed, you have a struggle,

412
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:35,220
you have something to fight for, and therefore, a purpose.

413
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,740
But for a lot of men, their lack of purpose

414
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,020
puts them in search of a struggle.

415
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,320
And that, along with the loneliness

416
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,420
and the lack of a positive identity,

417
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:46,680
is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment

418
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,060
by the manosphere groups and by the alt-right.

419
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:52,000
And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor

420
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,540
for the small but growing number of young men

421
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,200
who decide to pick up a gun

422
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,340
and open fire in a shopping center.

423
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,240
There were two mass shootings during the weekend

424
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,540
I was writing this video, resulting in 31 deaths.

425
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,240
Both shooters were young white men,

426
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,440
and one of them posted about the shooting

427
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,820
on an alt-right image board.

428
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,200
Now, I don't pretend to fully understand

429
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
the motives of mass shooters, but I don't think it's true.

430
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,200
I don't think it's true.

431
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,600
I don't think it's a coincidence

432
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,540
that basically all of them are men.

433
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,620
One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic

434
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,200
is that these killers are trying to resurrect

435
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,420
some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory,

436
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,400
and therefore, to be seen and recognized as men

437
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,880
by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.

438
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,600
And of course, there's also the racism

439
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,960
of the alt-right killers,

440
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,980
and the wounded sexual entitlement of the incel killers.

441
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,540
But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,

442
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:44,020
and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis

443
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,920
are more receptive to learning it.

444
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,360
So, you can try to take down their forums,

445
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,420
and ban their accounts, and de-platform their events,

446
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:55,300
but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,

447
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,000
I don't see any end to these problems.

448
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,360
Theorem four, what do?

449
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:03,160
There is this media narrative that has emerged

450
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,120
around me and around this channel.

451
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,220
And by the way, the fact that there's any kind

452
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,120
of media narrative about this channel

453
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,420
is super fucking coconuts.

454
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,140
Because let's be real, Gorge,

455
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,920
I just wanted to pour milk on my face

456
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,260
and talk about the mouthfeel.

457
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,300
But there's this media narrative that my role

458
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:23,300
in the discourse is de-radicalizing young alt-right men.

459
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,180
And it's true that if you read

460
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:28,480
the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,

461
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,860
I used to be alt-right posts are so common

462
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,300
they're considered cliche.

463
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,700
And some of them cite me as an influence

464
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,020
in changing their politics, which I love for them,

465
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,940
and I'm super fucking happy about it, but it's also,

466
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:43,620
um, a lot of responsibility.

467
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:48,140
They're my boys, and I worry about my boys.

468
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,040
Because in reality, it's not like they go

469
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,820
from far right extremists to complacent centrists.

470
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,100
No, most of them go far left.

471
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,780
A lot of them become communists or anarchists.

472
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,700
So I watch them go from far to my right

473
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,780
to significantly to my left.

474
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:04,920
It's not really de-radicalizing so much as re-radicalizing.

475
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,900
And I think it's definitely an improvement,

476
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,560
but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.

477
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,780
I worry about my boys because I don't think

478
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:16,540
that the left yet has a final solution to the man question.

479
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:19,120
Oh no, that was worded poorly.

480
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,080
You know, there's kind of two options the left has

481
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,340
for disillusioned men.

482
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,800
The first is the Marxist promise of economic revolution.

483
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,620
We say, well, actually, yes, you are oppressed,

484
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,620
but you're oppressed because of your class, not your gender.

485
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,860
So just join the revolution.

486
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,820
It's gonna be super fucking crazy.

487
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,360
We're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie, meow, meow.

488
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,280
Smash, no voting.

489
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,560
And then things will be better for you.

490
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,180
Now, I think that has a couple limitations.

491
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,880
One is that I look at the far left

492
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,580
and I see a bunch of people who spend all their time

493
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,200
accusing each other of abusing moderator privileges

494
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
in closed Facebook groups.

495
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,700
And I'm concerned that might not succeed

496
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,040
at ending capitalism, meow, meow.

497
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:01,940
Like definitely vote for Bernie Sanders

498
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,440
or Elizabeth Warren or whoever.

499
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,060
But if you're investing all of your hopes

500
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:09,260
in a capital R revolution, I worry that can be

501
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,520
become like waiting for Godot or waiting for the rapture.

502
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,140
So we do need political change,

503
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,080
but I feel like I'm failing my boys

504
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,700
if I'm somehow giving them the idea

505
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,920
that revolution is their only hope.

506
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,220
Cause here's the other thing,

507
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,920
even if we did succeed ending capitalism,

508
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,140
there would still be gender.

509
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,260
And my boys would still need some model

510
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,480
of what it is to lead a good life as a man.

511
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,140
Now the other option the left has for disillusioned men

512
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,340
is the feminist tranquilizer.

513
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:38,620
We say, look, talk about how it's not about how you live.

514
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,220
This is the feminist tranquilizer.

515
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,560
Toxic masculinity is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings and it's the reason

516
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,920
you feel lonely and inadequate. So while feminism tells women you hate your body and you're

517
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:53,540
constantly doubting yourself because society did this to you and needs to change, we kind of just

518
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:59,180
tell men you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic. Stop it. We tell them they're broken without

519
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:05,900
really telling them how to fix themselves. I think what we need is a new positive ideal of manhood

520
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:10,820
which I don't think is something that women can create for men even if they wanted to. And honestly

521
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:15,440
the best way for that to happen may actually be some kind of men's movement. But on the left the

522
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:21,360
whole idea of a men's movement is basically taboo because the men's movement we all know is basically

523
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,820
just a backlash to feminism and at worst it's just straight up misogyny. And look boys, I understand

524
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:33,160
that being lectured about man spreading for most of 2015 was super fucking hard for you and you're

525
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,880
still mad about it but posting endless

526
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:41,360
outrage porn about false rape accusations and paternity fraud isn't actually going to make life

527
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:46,920
any better for you. Because yes, those things are horrible when they happen but they're not systemic

528
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,200
issues that affect most men. I think what would actually improve life for most men is a positive

529
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:59,780
ideal of 21st century manhood but that's not something I can give to you because in case you

530
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:04,800
hadn't noticed I'm literally a fucking woman. I can't mom you through this one boys, you're on

531
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,260
your own.

532
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:16,920
You don't have to help each other. So find each other in the comments section, meet up on reddit, make friends, clean your room, leave the house, fuck each other, I don't know, it's worth a try.

533
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:24,600
And failing that, you could always throw in the towel and become a woman. Worked for me.

534
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:46,920
I'll see you in the next one.

535
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,920
Bye.

turned men into women it's disgusting as an ally to men it's not my place to speak for them or speak
