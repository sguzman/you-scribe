0	16800	Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush
16800	22600	aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson
22600	31520	is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile, and I will
31520	34500	not stop until I reach the gates of hell.
36860	37940	You know what, America?
38260	41340	Things have not gone well.
41700	43080	We're having a hard time.
43160	43600	We are.
43600	49980	Between the plague, the quarantine, the oppressive policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising
49980	52600	tide of fascism, the criminalization.
52600	57200	Criminal negligence of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease that
57200	59720	has killed 200,000 people and counting.
60440	64440	Of course, there's going to be some trumpet in the comments saying, it's not that big
64440	64860	a deal.
65020	66240	Calm down.
67520	69700	People die all the time.
69960	73400	Funny, that's not what she said about Benghazi.
73600	76640	We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness.
77300	82040	And unfortunately, Uncle Joe is not really the man for the job.
82040	87680	I was a Bernie supporter and I regret not being more vocal about it when I had the chance.
87680	90160	So this time, I'm going to say something.
90160	94920	Because even though Biden is not my boy, I still think that dethroning Trump by electing
94920	98920	Biden is the single most important thing any American can do right now.
98920	102460	So allow me to make my case gorge.
102460	106600	By now leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video and I'm sure they're firing
106600	108360	off hot takes as we speak.
108360	109880	Typical T-Thought Normie Radlib endorses the election of Donald Trump.
109880	110880	I don't know if that's the right word.
110880	111880	I don't know.
111880	112880	I don't know.
112880	113880	I don't know.
113880	114880	I don't know.
114880	115880	I haven't seen the current electoral farce.
115880	116880	Is this your leftist queen of YouTube?
116880	120520	Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain about canceled culture than revolt
120520	123000	against the neoliberal status quo.
123000	124000	Tabby chan.
124000	125000	Tabby chan.
125000	126120	You know what, Tabitha?
126120	128820	For once I'm actually going to take the bait.
128820	133480	So this will be a conversation with the communist Twitter cat girl that lives in my brain.
133480	134520	Ne-aw.
134520	140040	I'm making this video because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so
140040	141320	disillusioned with . . .
141320	145880	that system that they intend not to vote in this election and yeah some of them are probably
145880	151800	russian bots but that's fine maybe i can win over the russian bot vote so i really do understand
151800	156920	the perspective that biden is not worth voting for because that was also my first reflex when
156920	162760	he was nominated but on reflection i think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake
162760	167320	don't make me in my bathroom tile children there's probably asbestos in that tile because america's
167320	172680	so great even the floor is made of poison okay tabby chan give me your worst i want free health
172680	178200	care student debt cancelled and worker ownership of the means of production biden won't give us
178200	181880	any of that and i don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change things
182440	187640	well listen tabby chan none of us want to vote for joe biden i don't want to vote for joe biden
187640	193080	any more than i want to retile my bathroom but sometimes a situation gets so toxic and so
193080	197240	dangerous well you have no choice but to get your hands dirty and in this election
197320	204200	i consider a vote for biden primarily a vote against trump you know voting for a politician
204200	209320	is not necessarily the same as supporting the politician i don't think anyone should
209320	215560	stand joe biden i'm not asking you to like comment and subscribe to joe biden's only fans
215560	221960	fascinating though i'm sure it is the president has a big stick to me voting is more of a
221960	227160	utilitarian calculation based on the likely consequences of each candidate
227160	227300	winning or losing the election it's not just a vote for the president it's a vote for the president
227300	234260	It's not hero worship, it's not choosing a person to have a beer with, it's strategy.
234260	235360	Bad strategy?
235360	237040	Biden is no better than Trump.
237040	241740	The Dems are just Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility.
241740	247340	Well, I agree that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's
247340	250060	no difference between them and the Republicans.
250060	254740	I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real difference between Trump and Hillary,
254740	259620	but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would not have done.
259620	263500	Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion fanatics, withdrawing from the
263500	267540	Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting
267540	271860	to remove medical non-discrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the
271860	276020	integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling
276020	280880	white nationalist militias very fine people and telling them to stand by, aspiring to
280880	284620	be an autocratic dictator and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing
284620	284720	a democracy that is not a democracy.
284720	288060	And a deadly pandemic in the name of delusional macho posturing.
288060	292540	So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make a real difference if they're
292540	303680	in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're a woman or LGBTQ or a human who
303680	305280	lives on the planet Earth.
305280	310080	So Biden will give us rainbow capitalism and streets named after Black Lives Matter, but
310080	312600	he'll do nothing to bring about systemic change.
312600	313600	Well, Tabby Chan.
313600	314600	I'm sorry to say.
314600	316480	I agree with you about that.
316480	320980	I fully expect to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted
320980	321980	for.
321980	327020	So you sit here vote-shaming me and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?
327020	331240	You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote.
331240	332240	Tabby Chan.
332240	333240	Tabby Chan.
333240	336060	Look, I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade.
336060	339240	Why is it that when you tell people on the left to vote, they think you're saying quit
339240	343940	your job, abandon your family, retreat from society, and fall into a deep slumber from
343940	348300	which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib before fleeing into
348300	352700	the forest and reentering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch temple awaiting
352700	355380	the return of Baals above?
355380	356700	Voting doesn't take that long.
356700	358480	At most it takes one day.
358480	360440	You can vote and do other things also.
360440	364220	I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman with the we'd be at brunch
364220	365220	sign.
365220	370380	And I feel you, though, to be honest, I would eat a Louis 16th style armchair with a pair
370380	373320	of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now.
373320	375680	Could you be any bougier?
375680	376680	Don't call me bougie.
376680	377680	I'm beyond bougie.
377680	381920	When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie, I scoff at them openly.
381920	387380	I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my fiefdom.
387380	391220	You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine.
391220	392920	Why should I listen to what you say?
392920	393920	Oh, you shouldn't.
393920	396160	I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly.
396160	400160	But also, I am a degenerate class traitor, and in my opinion, influencers should be the
400160	401160	first against the wall.
401160	402160	Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly.
402160	403160	I'm not a class traitor.
403160	404160	I just want to get it over with.
404160	407120	You at least have to admire that about us, libs.
407120	411160	We have a remarkable willingness to have polite conversations with people who are trying
411160	412160	to kill us.
412160	417100	Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan, but what is your plan,
417100	418100	Tabitha?
418100	419100	Uh, protest?
419100	420100	Unionize?
420100	421100	Mutual aid?
421100	422100	Strikes?
422100	423100	So I totally agree.
423100	424640	Those are all good things to do.
424640	426960	I've gone to protests myself this year.
426960	429160	I've given to a mutual aid group.
429160	432160	You know, you're right that voting won't fix all our problems, and it's good to get
432160	433160	involved in local things.
433160	436600	But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?
436600	439320	And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus.
439320	442160	So in addition to whatever else you're doing, vote.
442160	446540	Why participate in the charade of a farcical election?
446540	447540	America is not democratic.
447540	450540	It's a rigged, two-party corporadocracy.
450540	455860	Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot wrong with our elections.
455860	461160	Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression,
461160	462160	DC being disenfranchised.
462160	468160	All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't think that in this moment, leftists
468160	471400	boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.
471400	475400	Okay, but voting is for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit.
475400	476400	Ew.
476400	478780	Okay, yeah, it's true that voting is not cool.
478780	479780	It's boring.
479780	480780	It's incrementalist.
480780	484600	It doesn't make you feel like you're owning the libs or being edgier than your parents.
484600	489400	But you know, you could always vote in secret and then maintain your radical image around
489400	490400	your friends.
490400	491400	Isn't being involved in politics inherently not cool?
491400	497020	Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things, people who
497020	501560	place their hope in fallible human beings, all of which is very not cool.
501560	506780	I feel like so much of internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing.
506780	511520	It's showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through all
511520	517020	the bullshit, the corrupt system, the electoral farce, but all you're doing about it is sitting
517020	521360	here shitposting and demeaning the people who are actually trying to accomplish what
521400	522400	little can be accomplished.
522400	528480	And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing are no different
528480	531560	from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.
531560	536540	Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.
536540	540180	Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses?
540180	542780	This ends in violence either way, so we may as well smash.
542780	548100	Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly, but if there's a decisive Biden
548100	549400	victory, and it's not some kind of vote recount nightmare, then I'm not going to vote against
549400	550400	him.
551400	555220	I think the military will force Trump to leave.
555220	559760	Don't get me wrong, Tabby Chan, times are tough, the president is a fascist, I think
559760	564000	this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising than it's ever been in my life.
564000	567140	But if it comes to smashing, you're going to want allies.
567140	572700	And for a lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory, therefore rejecting
572700	576720	democracy itself, that would legitimize smashing.
576720	579680	So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.
579680	580480	But capitalism is the root of the problem.
581400	585880	The whole system is broken and voting won't change that.
585880	590120	We don't need a democrat, we need to end capitalism.
590120	596080	Tabitha, capitalism is an epic world economic order.
596080	602380	When you say end capitalism, you're talking about a tectonic shift in global politics
602380	607140	that is so much bigger than all of us that I don't really understand what course of action
607140	608140	you're recommending.
608140	609280	Like, before capitalism, there was feudalism.
609280	610280	And feudalism is a very big thing.
610280	611280	It's a huge thing.
611280	617680	And feudalism ended over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population and production.
617680	622020	Not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism.
622020	627460	So won't capitalism end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it?
627460	631040	I don't think that's the kind of thing that can be accomplished by a small group of activists.
631040	635760	And I say small group because, I'm sorry to break it to you, but the vast majority of
635760	637440	Americans are not communists.
637440	639960	I think a lot of internet leftists have a vastly overinflated society.
639960	640960	And I'm not saying they're not communists.
640960	643640	I'm just saying they have a very very overinflated sense of how big and important they are.
643640	644920	I fell prey to it myself.
644920	648820	Like, I was so sure that Bernie was going to win the primary.
648820	654260	In part because, when I looked at my timeline, I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support
654260	656720	for Bernie and contempt for the mainstream Dems.
656720	662080	But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds, is a finely curated and
662080	665040	very unrepresentative sample of the population.
665040	668960	You have to remember that only 22% of Americans use Twitter at all.
668960	670300	Most users rarely tweet.
670300	673860	And 80% of tweets come from 10% of users.
673860	680200	So 80% of tweets come from 2% of Americans, and it's not a representative 2%.
680200	684420	According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population in that they're
684420	689080	on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats, more educated, and a higher
689080	690080	income.
690080	695660	And far-left, hammer-and-sickle Twitter is an even smaller, even more unrepresentative
695660	697180	sample within a sample.
697180	700140	We're talking about less than 0.1% of Americans.
700300	705480	And that less than 0.1% does have an outsize influence, because they're prolific tweeters,
705480	709100	and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform.
709100	713480	Which is why there's so much discourse about cancel culture, even though cancel culture
713480	716620	is produced by a relatively tiny group of people.
716620	721680	So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians cater to this retrograde soft
721680	725460	conservatism, you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.
725460	728300	Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign.
728300	729300	And I invited a group of people to join me.
729300	730300	And I invited a group of people to join me.
730300	731300	And I invited a group of people to join me.
731300	732300	And I invited a group of people to join me.
732300	733300	After some resourceful engagement, I convinced them to commit to supporting the process.
733300	734300	After some resourceful engagement, I convinced them to commit to supporting the process.
734300	740580	And I really recommend that leftists try doing this for at least one election, even though
740580	743300	it is the worst thing in the world and I hated it so much.
743300	745300	You know, you do have to listen to a lot of
745300	750200	I don't want Barack Hussein Obama redistributing my wealth.
750200	755460	Okay Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama is not sending his death panels out to your landscaping
755460	757480	business but whatever.
757480	759480	Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities of which your fellow Republicans are in a
759480	759980	difficult position.
760300	765820	Americans actually care about. And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,
765960	770980	you know, I talked to union families, but I don't think I talked to a single communist. You know,
771100	776580	most people do not read theory. Most people are concerned primarily with themselves and their
776580	780960	families. They want personal security and prosperity. And if you look at the talking
780960	785660	points used by politicians, they reflect that. That's why the right hammer is not about Antifa
785660	790520	so much. Because it works. Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.
791080	796420	And this idea of Antifa looters and riots, it scares the shit out of people. Of course,
796500	803400	in reality, Antifa is not scary. Like, I've met Antifa. And Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.
804100	811180	It's Ryan and his transgender, furry anarchist friends. But look, if what you want is socialism,
811180	815600	or even just social democracy, then you have a lot of work ahead of you,
815680	821600	in terms of outreach. You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness. But you don't want to
821600	826420	do that, because it requires that you stop owning the libs and start actually communicating with
826420	832560	them. You have to build alliances with, like, Facebook moms who ask ignorant questions, like,
832960	837920	what's Indigenous People's Day? And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the
837920	842320	height of praxis. And who probably watch ContraPoints, how embarrassing. You know,
842360	845640	you can't let your radical queer friends catch you associating with mainstream,
845660	853520	normie libs. How very bourgeois. But, revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.
854580	860340	Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution and overthrow the US
860340	871220	government. That's very valid. That's super hecking valid. That's extremely valid. I mean,
871220	875340	I guess I admire the ambition. Uh, just a couple quick follow-up questions, though.
875660	881700	Are you counting on the US military and police taking the side of the communists, or is your plan to overpower them?
881700	885260	Because unless you know something about the military that I don't, I don't think that
885260	891380	much of the military is going to defect to join a communist revolution. So there will have to be a war.
891380	896460	You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight. After the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from
896460	902460	1917 to 1923. So you are going to need to raise a Red Army. I mean, you can't have a communist
902460	905460	revolution without a Red Army, right? So how's that going for you?
905460	910500	going, Tabitha? How many weapons have you amassed? How many units have you trained?
911340	915480	Why are we talking about this? Why am I even entertaining this notion? You know,
915500	919420	when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government, they actually mean
919420	923760	it. And you know they mean it because they have literal militias, the three percenters,
924000	929160	the boogaloo boys. They're stockpiling weapons and training to use them. They have ex-military
929160	933620	men in their ranks and connections to white supremacists within the police and the military.
933620	940780	Whereas when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter, it strikes me as ideation, not intent.
941200	946180	You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between two kinds of suicidal thinking. So
946180	950920	there's intent, which is when you have a plan for how you're going to do it, and then they have to
950920	955680	commit you because you're a danger to yourself. And then there's ideation, which is, you know,
955700	960220	you're not actually going to do it, but you just have that inner monologue that's constantly saying,
960220	963500	I just want to die. There's no more joy.
963620	968060	I'm going to be left in this world. I just can't stand it anymore. I just want to end it all.
968660	974580	And then my psychiatrist says, well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro. And I say,
974880	982200	not again, doctor. Not again. So right-wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,
982620	989320	whereas left-wing radical discourse often amounts to revolutionary ideation. It's a kind of fantasy
989800	992180	escapism, an alternative to politics.
993620	999060	Plan a revolution. Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice.
999660	1004540	Yeah, so a riot is the language of the unheard. But what kind of language is it?
1004900	1010380	What is the point of speaking through a riot, or a protest, or a strike? Is it just emotional
1010380	1015800	expression, like an angry diary entry? Or is the point not just to speak, but to be heard?
1016160	1021460	Heard by whomst? Who are you trying to persuade? The glob glob glob glob? No, you want to be
1021460	1023600	heard by the people with the power to change the world. You want to be heard by the people with the power to change the world.
1023600	1025540	You want to be heard by the people with the power to change things. So it matters whether the people
1025540	1030740	with power are likely to listen. This year, the U.S. has seen one of the biggest protest movements
1030740	1036080	in history. And what has that accomplished? Well, at the moment, we have a president promising to
1036080	1041160	double down on law and order, on military police suppression, a president who told a room full of
1041160	1046520	cops not to be too gentle with the people they arrest. And when you see these thugs being thrown
1046520	1053320	into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in rough. I said, please don't be too nice.
1053600	1059920	And let's be clear, both Biden and Copmala have an ugly record when it comes to crime and policing.
1059920	1064400	For most of his career, Biden has called for more policing, which is the opposite of what we need
1064400	1069200	right now. I'm right there with you, Tabby Chan. But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse
1069200	1075440	about policing and criminal justice. And Biden has responded by beginning to shift his position.
1075440	1079520	This year's Democratic platform includes things like stricter use of force standards,
1079520	1082720	banning chokeholds, restricting qualified immunity,
1082720	1088320	creating a registry of police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants, decriminalizing weed,
1088320	1092240	investing in crime prevention and social work. And is that good enough?
1092240	1097360	No, it's not good enough. But it's a start. It's progress. It shows that the Democrats are
1097360	1102640	at least willing to listen to protests. When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961,
1102640	1106400	he didn't want to propose a civil rights bill because that would have been super unpopular
1106400	1111920	with the Southern Democrats. But then 1963 happened, and there were protests and uprisings
1112720	1116720	in Washington, D.C., and the March on Washington that summer. And Kennedy listened.
1116720	1123040	The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality
1123040	1128720	that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.
1128720	1134000	He was moved by the protests, and he responded by introducing what became the
1134000	1139200	Civil Rights Act of 1964. But what if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963?
1139200	1142640	What if some fascist had been president? What if Trump had been president?
1143120	1149200	We might not have gotten a Civil Rights Act. So it does matter who's president. It actually
1149200	1156720	matters a lot. And please, Tabby Chun, do not let a fascist win to own the libs. God damn it.
1156720	1162720	All right, fam, let's open a new tab. Go to vote.gov and enter your state.
1162720	1167040	And yeah, I know this is boring, but I'm trying to think about the tantrum Trump
1167040	1172080	is going to throw when an entire nation rejects him, and I'm letting that motivate me.
1172720	1178000	Some states you can still register, so register now if you still haven't. If you're voting in
1178000	1184800	person, go to vote.org and find your polling place and make a plan for how you're going to get there.
1184800	1191200	Make sure your phone's charged, and you might want to bring some snacks or even some friends.
1191200	1196960	If you're like me, you need to set an alarm so you don't forget, and then just try not to get
1196960	1202000	inconsolably high until after you've placed your vote. Because we've all been living through a year
1202720	1208960	of financial crisis. And I, for one, think that we all deserve to begin 2021 by collectively
1208960	1215600	purging from our lives this swindling, pestilent doofus. Vote him out.
1232720	1262700	Judgment and justice will be done in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and of the Holy Spirit, and of the Holy Spirit.
1262720	1292700	For I know that I have made poor to you, and to the poor, and to the lowly, and to the lowly.
1292720	1322700	For I know that I have made poor to you, and to the lowly, and to the lowly.
1322720	1352700	For I know that I have made poor to you, and to the lowly, and to the lowly.
1352720	1382700	For I know that I have made poor to you, and to the lowly, and to the lowly.
1382720	1394720	The earth is now album of the knowledge that no truth sets the water before the sea.
1394720	1412720	For I know the thoughts that I think are the increase of his government, and these filled me to evidence that were the thrones of David and Gabriel's kingdom,
1412720	1419560	I want to establish the judgment and justice for the time.
