00:00.000 --> 00:08.080
Sar, I'm going to talk about Joro once again, but first, story time.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.440
Chapter 1. Anita

00:12.800 --> 00:19.840
The most famous spigot in American LGBT history is a woman called Anita Bryant. This is her story.

00:22.000 --> 00:29.840
1977 was not a good time to be gay. Is it ever really a good time to be gay?

00:30.000 --> 00:35.040
In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights into national consciousness.

00:35.040 --> 00:39.760
The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970, and in 1973 the American

00:39.760 --> 00:43.920
Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.360
But only after gay activists disrupted their conference and shouted,

00:47.360 --> 00:54.560
Gay conversion therapy is torture! We have abnormal urges and we will not be silenced!

00:56.160 --> 00:58.400
Because that's the only way to get anything done in this country,

00:58.400 --> 01:00.000
you have to be super annoying about it.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.520
They give you no choice.

01:01.520 --> 01:08.560
On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida, known for such popular cities as Miami,

01:08.560 --> 01:10.480
approved a law that added the phrase,

01:10.480 --> 01:14.880
Affectional or Sexual Preference to its non-discrimination ordinance,

01:14.880 --> 01:19.840
effectively banning housing and employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.840
And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,

01:23.840 --> 01:26.480
that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.

01:26.480 --> 01:29.680
Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!

01:30.000 --> 01:34.080
Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman who once had a career as a pop singer,

01:34.080 --> 01:37.280
beauty queen, and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.120
Come to the Florida sunshine tree.

01:41.120 --> 01:45.040
My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida any time of day.

01:45.040 --> 01:48.800
Orange juice from Florida! It isn't just for breakfast anymore!

01:48.800 --> 01:55.680
Orange juice with natural vitamin C from the Florida sunshine tree.

01:55.680 --> 01:58.320
She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,

01:58.320 --> 01:59.840
A day without orange juice.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.920
is like a day without sunshine.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.520
Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.

02:05.520 --> 02:06.160
Cute.

02:06.160 --> 02:10.000
When Anita heard her pastor speak about this non-discrimination ordinance,

02:10.000 --> 02:13.520
she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.400
How touching.

02:14.400 --> 02:19.920
According to the word of God, it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.

02:19.920 --> 02:22.880
As a mother, she would not stand for this.

02:22.880 --> 02:26.000
So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner saying,

02:26.000 --> 02:28.160
As a concerned mother of four children,

02:28.160 --> 02:30.000
I am most definitely against this.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.200
Ordinance Amendment.

02:31.200 --> 02:35.120
I have never condoned nor taught my children discrimination against anyone.

02:35.120 --> 02:38.240
But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,

02:38.240 --> 02:41.680
you will in fact be infringing upon my rights

02:41.680 --> 02:44.640
and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother

02:44.640 --> 02:48.480
to teach my children God's moral code as stated in the holy scriptures.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.720
Anita, kill your shitty child.

02:50.720 --> 02:54.720
When the amendment passed, Anita created a campaign for its repeal.

02:54.720 --> 02:59.680
The Save Our Children Coalition, which sponsored provocative TV ads,

02:59.680 --> 03:04.720
implying that gay people are degenerates who ruin communities and seduce children.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.400
The campaign has been vicious.

03:06.400 --> 03:11.440
With television commercials, the Save Our Children group is appealing to parental anxieties,

03:11.440 --> 03:15.600
saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality before impressionable children.

03:15.600 --> 03:20.400
The Orange Bowl Parade, Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.

03:20.400 --> 03:23.760
But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,

03:23.760 --> 03:28.640
it's a parade of homosexuals, men hugging other men, cavorting with little boys.

03:28.640 --> 03:29.520
Save Our Children.

03:29.680 --> 03:34.080
Sparked the first organized backlash to gay rights in the United States,

03:34.080 --> 03:37.040
escalating the conflict into a national controversy.

03:37.040 --> 03:39.600
On one side were the gay rights activists,

03:39.600 --> 03:42.720
who argued that non-discrimination was a matter of human rights.

03:42.720 --> 03:47.040
On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued that the non-discrimination ordinance

03:47.040 --> 03:50.320
would give special privileges to homosexuals.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.920
We all believe in human rights,

03:51.920 --> 03:56.400
but we don't believe in human rights that would corrupt our children

03:56.400 --> 03:58.880
or for individuals to have special privileges.

03:58.880 --> 03:59.440
We all believe in human rights, but we don't believe in human rights that would corrupt our children or for individuals to have special privileges.

03:59.440 --> 04:02.960
That would go against the constitutional rights of normal America.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.120
As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,

04:05.120 --> 04:06.960
they have equal rights the same as anyone else.

04:06.960 --> 04:09.760
In other words, gay people already have equal rights,

04:09.760 --> 04:13.680
just as long as they stay in the closet and don't do anything gay.

04:13.680 --> 04:16.000
That's very helpful.

04:16.000 --> 04:23.760
Thank you so much, Anita, for standing up for our right to be gay in secret.

04:23.760 --> 04:28.640
As long as they do their job and do not want to come out of the closet and force their homosexuality

04:28.640 --> 04:32.160
on me in the areas of business or in the schools,

04:32.160 --> 04:36.240
they can live their life and we're not going out after their jobs

04:36.240 --> 04:38.960
or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.

04:38.960 --> 04:44.160
Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals to teach children

04:44.160 --> 04:46.400
was tantamount to gay recruitment.

04:46.400 --> 04:49.680
Just biologically that God made mothers so that we could reproduce.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.040
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,

04:53.040 --> 04:56.720
but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.560
It's the exact same argument that's being used

04:58.560 --> 05:03.040
today by right-wing politicians who claim that queer people are groomers.

05:03.040 --> 05:09.120
Stop confusing our babies with your groomer gender ideologue.

05:09.120 --> 05:12.640
This wicked book, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,

05:12.640 --> 05:16.400
sexually indoctrinated with wicked, vile books.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.960
And she believes in traditional marriage between a man and a woman,

05:18.960 --> 05:21.040
and in that book it talked about two moms.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.400
Stay away from the children creep or you will regret it.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.400
People should definitely arm themselves, I agree with that.

05:26.400 --> 05:28.400
The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.

05:28.560 --> 05:33.040
The Democrats are the party of teachers, elementary school teachers,

05:33.040 --> 05:37.120
trying to transition their elementary school-aged children

05:37.120 --> 05:39.120
and convince them they're a different gender.

05:39.120 --> 05:41.680
They're just evil people and they want to groom kids.

05:42.480 --> 05:43.520
They're recruiting.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.160
If you don't know what furries are, it's where school children

05:47.120 --> 05:51.440
dress up as animals, cats or dogs, during the school day.

05:52.320 --> 05:53.760
They meow and they bark.

05:53.760 --> 05:56.080
What a great country we live in.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.400
I love it so much.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.120
Gay people around the country rallied against Anita Bryant and Save Our Children.

06:03.120 --> 06:06.000
There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.040
with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu

06:09.040 --> 06:13.920
and replacing them with an apple juice and vodka cocktail called an Anita Bryant.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.040
Let's make one now.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.400
Forgot my cocktail measure, so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.

06:19.440 --> 06:21.280
Just a dash of apple juice.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.240
Give it a stir.

06:25.120 --> 06:26.000
Needs a garnish.

06:26.000 --> 06:26.500
Stir.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.000
Stir.

06:27.000 --> 06:27.500
Stir.

06:27.500 --> 06:28.000
Stir.

06:28.000 --> 06:28.500
Stir.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.120
Stunning.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.560
I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver, but if I was in the 70s,

06:32.560 --> 06:36.400
I would have thrown back so many of these goddamn things out of pure spite.

06:36.400 --> 06:41.680
There's a story that Troy Perry, the founder of the gay-affirming metropolitan community church,

06:41.680 --> 06:46.080
was on a transcontinental flight, and when the attendant put a glass of orange juice on his tray,

06:46.080 --> 06:46.880
he said,

06:46.880 --> 06:48.080
TAKE THAT AWAY.

06:48.080 --> 06:49.520
I'M A HOMOSEXUAL.

06:49.520 --> 06:56.640
At Gay Pride marches in 1977 and 78, anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently on t-shirts,

06:56.640 --> 06:57.920
signs, and buttons.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.160
Anita Bryant sucks oranges.

07:00.160 --> 07:03.680
A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.

07:03.680 --> 07:04.160
True.

07:04.160 --> 07:08.320
And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired more anti-gay legislation,

07:08.320 --> 07:12.880
including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage, both of which passed in the Florida

07:12.880 --> 07:17.680
Senate, as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California, which would have forced public

07:17.680 --> 07:19.680
schools to fire gay teachers.

07:19.680 --> 07:21.920
So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.

07:21.920 --> 07:23.760
She was an influential bigot.

07:23.760 --> 07:27.760
But she may also have helped to unify and galvanize gay activists,

07:27.920 --> 07:30.080
by providing them with a common enemy.

07:30.080 --> 07:32.240
According to historian Lillian Faderman,

07:32.240 --> 07:36.800
Anita Bryant created fervent activists out of those who'd previously been content

07:36.800 --> 07:39.120
simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.

07:39.120 --> 07:44.560
Faderman cites Eric Hoffer's observation that a mass movement can get along fine without a god,

07:44.560 --> 07:46.880
but it won't get along at all without a devil.

07:46.880 --> 07:50.960
For gay people all over the country, Anita Bryant became that devil.

07:50.960 --> 07:56.000
I think that she is rallying the community together like I have never seen before.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.600
There's no way I could have done it on my own.

07:57.920 --> 08:02.800
So even though she succeeded in her initial goal to repeal the non-discrimination ordinance,

08:02.800 --> 08:07.120
there is no question that in the long term, Anita Bryant was the loser.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.720
She took a lot of L's.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.280
RIP.

08:09.280 --> 08:10.640
That must be super hard for her.

08:10.640 --> 08:15.040
For the short remainder of her career, gay activists protested her events,

08:15.040 --> 08:19.840
they shut down the tour for her book about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,

08:19.840 --> 08:23.600
and they succeeded in turning public opinion against Anita Bryant

08:23.600 --> 08:27.680
to the point that she became virtually unemployable in mainstream entertainment.

08:27.920 --> 08:31.040
It helped that she came across as kind of a judgmental prude,

08:31.040 --> 08:35.040
that even hip straight people didn't want to be associated with.

08:35.040 --> 08:40.320
Our top story tonight, Anita Bryant, former mediocre actress and orange juice promoter,

08:40.960 --> 08:46.960
performed coitus in public yesterday, campaigned to promote heterosexuality.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.760
We don't serve orange juice anymore.

08:49.760 --> 08:51.920
Like she famously told Playboy magazine,

08:51.920 --> 08:54.240
Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?

08:54.240 --> 08:57.120
It's because they eat the forbidden fruit of the tree of life.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.960
God referred to men as trees.

08:58.960 --> 09:02.880
And because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit, which is male sperm.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.160
Oh my God.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.640
Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.

09:06.640 --> 09:08.160
This is how you lose the culture war.

09:08.160 --> 09:15.600
So let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita, pass a little juice around.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.360
And of course, there was the famous incident where a gay activist

09:19.360 --> 09:23.280
smashed a banana cream pie in Anita's face during a TV appearance.

09:23.280 --> 09:26.960
And went into a place called Norfolk, Virginia, and were met with protest,

09:27.120 --> 09:35.600
and, uh, um, all kinds of problems and, uh, uh, every security agent, security.

09:35.600 --> 09:36.560
No, no, let him stay.

09:36.560 --> 09:37.280
No, let him stay.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.000
Well, at least it's a fruit pie.

09:40.000 --> 09:44.800
Miami-Dade County finally reinstated the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998,

09:44.800 --> 09:48.160
and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.

09:48.160 --> 09:52.560
In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face.

09:52.560 --> 09:56.160
When her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,

09:57.120 --> 10:01.200
she was the only one who had the courage to a woman in publicly struggling

10:01.200 --> 10:03.920
with whether to even invite her grandmother to the ceremony.

10:03.920 --> 10:07.920
It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks that, like,

10:07.920 --> 10:12.800
an integral part of your identity is just, uh, an evil delusion.

10:12.800 --> 10:16.640
That it is, Sarah. That it is.

10:16.640 --> 10:21.040
So that's the story of Anita Bryant, as students of LGBT history know it.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.440
But isn't it a bit one-sided?

10:23.440 --> 10:26.080
Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?

10:26.080 --> 10:29.040
Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.160
Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.

10:32.160 --> 10:33.600
A plague on both the houses.

10:33.600 --> 10:38.960
Isn't it cruel, even, to slur Anita as a bigot and a homophobe?

10:38.960 --> 10:45.040
In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant was the real victim?

10:47.600 --> 10:49.200
Oh no. Oh no!

10:53.120 --> 10:54.240
I can't do this anymore.

10:54.240 --> 10:54.960
I'm eating my pie.

10:54.960 --> 10:55.920
I'm eating my goddamn pie.

10:55.920 --> 10:56.480
I'm eating my goddamn pie.

10:56.480 --> 10:57.120
Chapter Two.

10:57.680 --> 10:59.760
The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.560
God help us all.

11:01.680 --> 11:06.000
The mainstream media would have us believe that Anita Bryant is a so-called

11:06.000 --> 11:08.800
homophobe, some kind of hateful bigot.

11:08.800 --> 11:13.760
But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic used to silence valid concerns?

11:13.760 --> 11:19.280
Mothers in this country are worried about their children going to school to be taught by perverts.

11:19.280 --> 11:24.400
How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals weren't the real bigots?

11:24.400 --> 11:25.440
Isn't it possible, though?

11:25.440 --> 11:29.280
Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant was the first victim of cancel culture?

11:29.280 --> 11:32.240
Of, dare I say it, wokeism?

11:32.880 --> 11:33.760
Well, no.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.560
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.240
But suppose that you're an idiot.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.960
And suppose that that's the narrative you wanted to promote.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.800
Well, what would be your argument?

11:42.800 --> 11:46.320
I mean, if someone put a gun to my head and forced me to make that argument,

11:46.320 --> 11:48.720
I'd probably say something like this.

11:48.720 --> 11:51.600
Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.280
In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty in rural Oklahoma.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.480
Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,

11:58.480 --> 12:01.680
the same year she made her singing debut at the Baptist Church.

12:02.240 --> 12:05.520
Parts of my childhood, I blocked out because it hurts too much.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.280
I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old, and my parents were remarried,

12:09.280 --> 12:12.720
and I was baptized and came to know Christ as my personal savior.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.920
Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.

12:15.920 --> 12:19.280
It was real painful, and it just about killed my mother.

12:19.280 --> 12:21.280
She was a very submissive wife.

12:21.280 --> 12:24.080
She was too submissive, and it angered me.

12:24.080 --> 12:25.280
She let my dad step up.

12:25.280 --> 12:27.600
All over her because of him.

12:27.600 --> 12:30.720
I think I went through life for a long time hating all men.

12:30.720 --> 12:36.560
Anita described her most intense adolescent memory as a feeling of intense ambition,

12:36.560 --> 12:38.720
a relentless drive to succeed at doing well.

12:38.720 --> 12:39.440
The thing I loved.

12:49.440 --> 12:55.120
But Anita's ambition conflicted with her submissive role as a traditional Christian woman.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.320
In 1960, Anita married Bob Greene,

12:58.320 --> 13:02.640
Miami's top disc jockey, but only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.

13:02.640 --> 13:05.040
This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.

13:08.880 --> 13:12.000
Greene was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.

13:12.000 --> 13:14.080
Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,

13:14.080 --> 13:19.040
Greene manipulated Bryant with a cruelty nearly unmatched in modern love stories.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.760
And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,

13:21.760 --> 13:24.800
Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.

13:24.800 --> 13:26.960
But while submitting to her husband

13:26.960 --> 13:32.080
and raising four children, Anita was still able to build the career she'd always wanted.

13:32.080 --> 13:37.120
By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice, earning half a million dollars

13:37.120 --> 13:42.800
a year, enough to move her family into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.

13:42.800 --> 13:46.240
So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.

13:46.240 --> 13:52.800
Did she really deserve to lose it all just because she took a stand for something she believed in?

13:52.800 --> 13:54.720
Anita Bryant's role as a leader,

13:54.720 --> 13:59.940
in the campaign against homosexuals may be hurting her campaign to sell orange juice are you being

13:59.940 --> 14:05.640
blackballed well it's uh it's it looks that way it's it's worse than that we're being threatened

14:05.640 --> 14:10.660
and uh there's all kinds of harassment even with my job with florida citrus i have been blacklisted

14:10.660 --> 14:17.100
for exercising the right of a mother to defend her children and all children against their being

14:17.100 --> 14:22.480
recruited by homosexuals her entire life had become a series of catastrophes she'd been dropped as

14:22.480 --> 14:26.800
spokesperson by the orange growers she had been dropped as a commentator on the orange bowl parade

14:26.800 --> 14:30.940
she lost a television show contract her bookings dropped drastically

14:30.940 --> 14:47.000
no one has paid as dearly as nita bryant for taking a public stand on something she believed

14:47.000 --> 14:52.460
in i remember lying in the bed in my my mother's house in a fetal position

14:52.460 --> 14:58.200
and wanting to die gay activists in the 1970s didn't exactly limit their tactics to polite

14:58.200 --> 15:08.880
debate in the free marketplace of ideas homosexuals started fighting back the gays formed new groups

15:08.880 --> 15:14.400
and picketed the performers public appearances forcing her to cancel a few gay activists routinely

15:14.400 --> 15:20.320
compared anita to adolf h they created pastiches of her orange juice slogan they blamed her for

15:20.320 --> 15:22.280
hate crimes they burned her in

15:22.460 --> 15:28.280
refugee they disrupted events she was involved in they printed toilet paper with her face on it

15:28.280 --> 15:34.800
some sent anita death threats or they mailed her rotting oranges dead cockroaches human excrement

15:34.800 --> 15:39.080
see this is how you cancelled people before phones instead of posting you would

15:39.080 --> 15:45.120
simply mail actual human through the united states postal service neither snow nor rain nor

15:45.120 --> 15:50.800
heat nor gloom of night anita's husband pleaded to supporters how would you men feel if you opened

15:50.800 --> 15:52.440
a letter and there was a photo of her in the post office of the united states post office of the

15:52.440 --> 16:02.600
united states you can imagine quite a lot i do think it would be fair to say that a lot of the

16:02.600 --> 16:08.600
rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone lillian faderman recounts that lesbians particularly

16:08.600 --> 16:14.360
lesbian feminists abhorred the sexist terms that were being used to characterize anita bryant

16:14.360 --> 16:20.760
and gay men called her the harassment escalated to the point where anita had to cancel her book tour

16:20.760 --> 16:22.280
due to demonstrations and bribes against anita bryant who had been a victim of sexual abuse in the United States.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.280
bomb threats from gay activists and of course there was the pie

16:28.360 --> 16:32.840
so much for the tolerant matashin society it's kind of a deep cut well something to entertain

16:32.840 --> 16:38.200
the boomer queers gay activists claimed to stand for human rights but what about anita's right to

16:38.200 --> 16:43.880
free speech i wish i had some literal pearls to clutch civil libertarian nat hentoff wrote in his

16:43.880 --> 16:50.280
1992 book free speech for me but not for thee that the orange shoes boycott reminded him of a little

16:50.280 --> 16:52.280
thing called mccarthyism

16:52.680 --> 16:58.840
have you ever considered that being pro-gay is quite similar to being anti-gay and that both

16:58.840 --> 17:05.640
are opinions as anita tells it she and her foot soldiers of god were the victims of sinister gay

17:05.640 --> 17:10.760
carpetbaggers the foot soldiers were housewives and mothers religious and civic leaders in

17:10.760 --> 17:16.280
opposition to a well-organized highly financed and politically militant group of homosexual

17:16.280 --> 17:22.360
activists we were cast as bigots haters discriminators and deniers of basic

17:22.360 --> 17:27.480
human rights and all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned for our children and our

17:27.480 --> 17:33.720
community so anita's version of the story is that she and a handful of well-intentioned christian

17:33.720 --> 17:40.760
mothers were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia of gay extremists all because they had a

17:40.760 --> 17:47.240
few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual cavorting with little boys cavorting

17:47.240 --> 17:51.720
with little boys is it really fair to call this woman a bigot until the dade county or

17:51.720 --> 17:57.080
the county ordinance anita was a registered democrat and considered herself a liberal

17:57.080 --> 18:02.840
and she never said that she hated gay people or wanted them dead in fact she even said that she

18:02.840 --> 18:09.160
loves homosexuals i love homosexuals if you can believe that i love them enough to tell them the

18:09.160 --> 18:13.720
truth because i know that there is hope for the homosexuals that if they're willing to

18:14.840 --> 18:21.240
turn from sin the same as any individual that that they can be ex-homosexuals the same as there can

18:21.240 --> 18:21.640
be an extra homosexual question is she a bigot no she's not a bigot she's not a homosexual performally

18:21.640 --> 18:23.900
an ex-murderer, an ex-thief, or ex-anybody.

18:23.900 --> 18:28.340
She loves homosexuals because they can change,

18:28.340 --> 18:30.160
just like murderers.

18:30.160 --> 18:33.320
Would a bigot have said that?

18:33.320 --> 18:34.900
Just about McFuckin' had it.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.740
Anita was so kind-hearted,

18:36.740 --> 18:40.240
she even said that she related to the homosexual.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.040
I can relate to the homosexual

18:42.040 --> 18:44.940
because I've had emotional scars in my own life.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.920
I really felt the rejection of my father,

18:46.920 --> 18:48.100
and that is one of the things

18:48.100 --> 18:51.140
that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.

18:51.140 --> 18:54.220
Look, I don't hate homosexuals, that's the truth,

18:54.220 --> 18:56.140
no matter what they think of my motives.

18:56.140 --> 18:58.660
I've always said I love the sinner, but I hate the sin.

18:58.660 --> 19:01.300
Wow, what an empath.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.180
You know, I actually think it's really noble

19:03.180 --> 19:06.380
how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage

19:06.380 --> 19:07.800
onto the marginalized group

19:07.800 --> 19:10.540
whose rights she's trying to take away.

19:10.540 --> 19:13.700
Okay, so we've given a fair hearing to both sides,

19:13.700 --> 19:16.940
to many sides, we've considered all the evidence.

19:16.940 --> 19:20.200
Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head

19:20.200 --> 19:21.040
and ask,

19:21.140 --> 19:25.320
did Anita Bryant really deserve that pie to the face?

19:25.320 --> 19:28.160
Well, yes, obviously.

19:28.160 --> 19:29.740
Look, the point I'm trying to make here

19:29.740 --> 19:32.620
is that it's possible to take genuine virtues

19:32.620 --> 19:35.660
like nuance, empathy, and impartiality,

19:35.660 --> 19:38.800
and to twist them into fucked-up apologia

19:38.800 --> 19:40.940
for horrible, oppressive behavior.

19:40.940 --> 19:42.640
If you play this game long enough,

19:42.640 --> 19:44.380
you can essentially explain away

19:44.380 --> 19:46.380
the entire concept of bigotry

19:46.380 --> 19:49.760
and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.

19:51.140 --> 19:53.320
This is the true nature of all of us,

19:53.320 --> 19:55.360
all of us who are human beings.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.840
We're all human beings who have been

19:57.840 --> 20:00.480
understood as people with difficult childhoods

20:00.480 --> 20:03.940
and valid concerns cruelly demonized

20:03.940 --> 20:07.500
by militant activists defaming and silencing them

20:07.500 --> 20:11.720
with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.

20:11.720 --> 20:16.080
Now, because you viewers are smart, media-literate people,

20:16.080 --> 20:19.040
you understand framing, so you already know

20:19.040 --> 20:20.980
that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant

20:20.980 --> 20:27.480
J.K. Rowling is a popular author who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,

20:27.480 --> 20:32.640
but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers masturbating into stolen panties

20:32.640 --> 20:35.140
because she's lost her goddamn mind.

20:35.140 --> 20:37.340
Lo ho ho, dear readers.

20:37.340 --> 20:40.140
Christ, what a nightmare.

20:40.140 --> 20:41.860
Chapter 3.

20:41.860 --> 20:44.460
The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.880
Alright kids, it's trans in time.

20:47.880 --> 20:53.440
Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps

20:53.440 --> 20:59.720
Roper, an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church, the notorious hate group from Topeka,

20:59.720 --> 21:05.840
Kansas most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers with signs that say God hates

21:05.840 --> 21:07.200
f**ks.

21:07.200 --> 21:09.960
God and me both, I'm tired of you people.

21:09.960 --> 21:10.960
J.K.

21:10.960 --> 21:11.960
Illy!

21:11.960 --> 21:16.440
The Westboro Baptist Church is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups in the

21:16.440 --> 21:17.440
world.

21:17.440 --> 21:20.980
I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.

21:20.980 --> 21:26.800
I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries, I went to a counter-protest in 2010, I remember

21:26.800 --> 21:31.340
how when I was in high school, the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing that

21:31.340 --> 21:37.680
conservatives and liberals could agree on because they hated the troops and the gays.

21:37.680 --> 21:40.680
Essentially the two genders of 2006.

21:40.680 --> 21:43.840
But let's not pretend that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.

21:43.840 --> 21:47.000
Okay, when Megan was at Westboro, she used to do these amazing ladies.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.160
She used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies about how the gays are going to hell, which

21:51.160 --> 21:54.400
to this day I am a big fan of.

21:54.400 --> 21:58.120
But what did you say you think God loves your brain?

21:58.120 --> 22:01.400
He hates all you do cause you love fornicating.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
Fornicating.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.400
Fornicating.

22:03.400 --> 22:04.400
It's perfect.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.400
I love it.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.400
Play it at my funeral.

22:06.400 --> 22:07.400
Stop praying, stop praying.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.400
God will not hear you anymore.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.400
You taught the boys and the girls to be proud.

22:09.400 --> 22:10.400
For, for, forever burn.

22:10.400 --> 22:11.400
Go devil's finder.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.400
God will not hear you anymore.

22:12.400 --> 22:13.400
You taught the boys and the girls to be proud.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.400
For, for, forever burn.

22:14.400 --> 22:15.400
Go devil's finder.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.360
For, for, forever burn.

22:16.360 --> 22:17.360
Go devil's finder.

22:17.360 --> 22:20.260
You just keep pushing on to the hell where you will forever burn.

22:20.260 --> 22:26.420
Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012 after a crisis of faith precipitated

22:26.420 --> 22:29.200
by a power struggle within the church.

22:29.200 --> 22:34.400
She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow, which is honestly a pretty interesting account

22:34.400 --> 22:39.740
of deconversion and the circumstances that lead someone to leaving a hate group.

22:39.740 --> 22:45.220
Megan contacted me for her podcast because I had criticized TjK Rowling in a video a

22:45.220 --> 22:46.220
couple years ago.

22:46.220 --> 22:50.500
Now, you might be wondering, why would I think that a person who's been carrying a

22:50.500 --> 22:55.580
God Hates F**ks sign most of her life would be the correct person to lead an international

22:55.580 --> 22:59.220
conversation about the intricacies of LGBT issues?

22:59.220 --> 23:01.120
Because I'm an idiot.

23:01.120 --> 23:02.120
Happy?

23:02.120 --> 23:06.860
Basically, I agreed to the podcast because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.

23:06.860 --> 23:13.220
A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church wants to mediate a conversation between me

23:13.220 --> 23:15.220
and the author of Harry Potter.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.220
Would you say no to that?

23:17.220 --> 23:19.220
Maybe.

23:19.220 --> 23:20.620
If you're smart.

23:20.620 --> 23:26.240
Last month, the podcast was announced in an essay by Megan titled The Witch Trials of

23:26.240 --> 23:27.240
J.K.

23:27.240 --> 23:28.240
Rowling.

23:28.240 --> 23:33.460
Obviously a tendentious framing that posits Joro as the target of an irrational trans

23:33.460 --> 23:34.460
witch hunt.

23:34.460 --> 23:41.100
The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,

23:41.100 --> 23:43.540
as well as a photo of an angry trans mob holding a rotten hell roll.

23:43.540 --> 23:44.540
I'm not sure if that's true.

23:44.540 --> 23:49.080
The quote was a rotten hell Rowling sign, juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians

23:49.080 --> 23:52.740
burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.

23:52.740 --> 23:54.980
This did not bode well.

23:54.980 --> 24:00.340
So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy to

24:00.340 --> 24:02.560
some kind of unearned J.K.

24:02.560 --> 24:04.540
Rowling redemption tour.

24:04.540 --> 24:10.560
This caused Megan's mom, Shirley, to quote tweet me, calling me a bigot against God.

24:10.560 --> 24:13.560
I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.

24:13.560 --> 24:18.180
There's only one of him, and he could really use your help, Shirley.

24:18.180 --> 24:24.660
I said in these tweets that I felt used, which that is how I felt, but ultimately I need

24:24.660 --> 24:28.020
to take full responsibility for my involvement in this.

24:28.020 --> 24:32.700
The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this is you honestly have no idea what

24:32.700 --> 24:37.960
the final product is going to be like, so the decision to participate is always a leap

24:37.960 --> 24:38.960
of faith.

24:38.960 --> 24:41.560
And I can't really say that Megan misled me.

24:41.560 --> 24:42.560
There are red flags from the video.

24:42.560 --> 24:43.560
I don't know.

24:43.560 --> 24:47.160
They were there from the beginning, and I ignored them because I was projecting my

24:47.160 --> 24:49.540
own hopes onto the situation.

24:49.540 --> 24:51.760
You know, it's a compelling story.

24:51.760 --> 24:58.460
I liked the idea that this famous former bigot could talk some sense into a famous current

24:58.460 --> 24:59.460
bigot.

24:59.460 --> 25:05.780
We all love a good redemption arc, and I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.

25:05.780 --> 25:09.700
That's something I've moved away from, but there's still part of me that wants to see

25:09.700 --> 25:11.180
the best in people.

25:11.180 --> 25:13.140
And to believe that people can change.

25:13.140 --> 25:19.040
If you just talk to them, and make a good enough argument.

25:19.040 --> 25:25.880
Maybe my wishful thinking was that because Megan left Westboro, that must mean that she

25:25.880 --> 25:31.960
must understand the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?

25:31.960 --> 25:38.680
And despite no evidence for this, my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally,

25:38.680 --> 25:41.040
and could be really effective at confronting Joe Roe about all the trans stuff.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.040
I don't know.

25:42.040 --> 25:57.500
I'm Megan Phelps-Roper, and these are the Witch Trials of JK Rowling.

25:57.500 --> 26:03.640
The Witch Trials of JK Rowling is more than seven hours of apologetics for JKR.

26:03.640 --> 26:10.920
The podcast presents Rowling as a complex, humane, heroic figure with an inspiring feminist

26:10.920 --> 26:11.920
backstory.

26:12.040 --> 26:16.540
Joe Rowling's rise to success is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.

26:16.540 --> 26:27.540
Now cruelly besieged by a vicious mob of transgender activists, all because she, as a woman, had

26:27.540 --> 26:32.980
a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.

26:32.980 --> 26:40.040
I had been becoming increasingly concerned about the way in which women were being shut

26:40.040 --> 26:41.040
down.

26:41.040 --> 26:44.360
And I felt had some very valid concerns.

26:44.360 --> 26:50.940
Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing of the conflict as feminists versus trans

26:50.940 --> 26:58.540
rights activists, whom Rowling describes as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

26:58.540 --> 27:05.640
For the first five hours of this podcast, Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational

27:05.640 --> 27:07.040
mob of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.

27:07.040 --> 27:08.040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

27:08.040 --> 27:09.040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

27:10.040 --> 27:11.040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

27:11.040 --> 27:12.040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

27:12.040 --> 27:13.040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.040
You are murdering trans children!

27:15.040 --> 27:16.040
Trans get up all time!

27:16.040 --> 27:20.120
A huge amount of I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

27:20.120 --> 27:22.280
And you did it at my birthday dinner!

27:22.280 --> 27:28.260
There's this one clip of some kind of antifa supersoldiers abrasive screaming that they

27:28.260 --> 27:29.920
play like once per episode.

27:29.920 --> 27:30.920
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit.

27:30.920 --> 27:34.920
You look like you got your teeth knocked out of your fuckin' flashes.

27:34.920 --> 27:35.480
Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares and you will die alive.

27:35.480 --> 27:37.100
I want to fight together.

27:37.100 --> 27:38.100
I support my family.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.440
I want to be a battle partner.

27:39.440 --> 27:39.560
I want to be a battle partner.

27:39.560 --> 27:40.000
I want to be a battle partner.

27:40.040 --> 27:46.780
And then it usually cuts to, like, somber monks chanting some kind of medieval lament.

27:46.780 --> 27:49.740
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

27:55.160 --> 28:00.200
Just in case you didn't get from the title that this is a witch hunt.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.820
Do you guys get it?

28:08.160 --> 28:09.120
Do you get it yet?

28:10.040 --> 28:12.400
Yeah, your teeth knocked out, you fucking fascist!

28:12.540 --> 28:14.160
Let's get up on time!

28:14.160 --> 28:21.260
And then these mobs of irrational, misogynistic, trans rights fanatics are contrasted with

28:21.260 --> 28:28.740
this poignant story of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband to publish our generation's

28:28.740 --> 28:30.300
most beloved novels.

28:30.700 --> 28:35.460
I was still very committed to those parts that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,

28:35.760 --> 28:39.480
because there was a truth to them and there was a power to them.

28:39.480 --> 28:39.940
The

28:39.940 --> 28:47.540
only voices of genuine trans dissent appear in episode six out of seven, more than five

28:47.540 --> 28:48.540
hours in.

28:48.540 --> 28:50.160
And there's only two of us.

28:50.160 --> 28:57.780
One is me, shame, and the other is a teenager named Noah, who kind of just seems like he

28:57.780 --> 29:04.620
wants to be liked and understood, and wishes that his favorite author would please stop

29:04.620 --> 29:06.600
saying bigoted things about him.

29:06.600 --> 29:09.560
I'm such a big Harry Potter fan where I was such a big Harry Potter fan.

29:09.940 --> 29:13.600
especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.

29:14.280 --> 29:16.380
I can't even state how important it was to me.

29:16.920 --> 29:21.700
J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography from my third grade classroom

29:21.700 --> 29:24.740
and I kept it for a long time because I just loved reading it

29:24.740 --> 29:26.140
because I just admired her so much.

29:26.140 --> 29:29.000
It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.

29:29.320 --> 29:32.180
On my last day editing this video, I got in touch with Noah.

29:32.620 --> 29:36.240
I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast he wanted me to pass along

29:36.240 --> 29:37.620
and this is what he said.

29:37.620 --> 29:40.860
I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue are very different

29:40.860 --> 29:42.380
from any sort of rhetorical debate.

29:42.940 --> 29:45.080
Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,

29:45.240 --> 29:47.500
but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,

29:47.980 --> 29:50.880
the outcome of this conversation dictates their health, well-being,

29:51.000 --> 29:52.060
and ability to survive.

29:52.300 --> 29:55.280
How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling should come second

29:55.280 --> 29:58.180
to fighting for maintained access to health care, support,

29:58.320 --> 30:01.600
and general resources for children and adolescents seeking gender care.

30:01.880 --> 30:02.720
I agree.

30:03.140 --> 30:04.840
The most frustrating thing about this podcast

30:04.840 --> 30:07.600
is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.

30:07.620 --> 30:12.760
They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling is the victim of a witch hunt

30:12.760 --> 30:15.580
in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.720
These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.220
I mean, TERF is basically witch.

30:22.860 --> 30:26.140
But if you point this out, they just deny it.

30:26.340 --> 30:28.280
Show me the actual words, Jack.

30:28.460 --> 30:32.280
Show me where I said I'm the victim of a witch hunt by trans people.

30:32.600 --> 30:35.460
You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

30:35.700 --> 30:37.580
Yes, a podcast on which,

30:37.780 --> 30:41.600
I never once say I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.

30:41.900 --> 30:42.660
What are you talking about?

30:42.680 --> 30:44.360
I'm not scamming the government, if that's what you're saying.

30:44.480 --> 30:46.120
Your license plate says scamming.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.400
Uh, no.

30:49.100 --> 30:49.980
What do you mean, no?

30:51.120 --> 30:51.560
Yes.

30:52.480 --> 30:52.960
Joanne.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.880
Show me where I ever said that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.

30:58.380 --> 31:00.460
Why would you even think that?

31:00.700 --> 31:02.380
You're crazy.

31:02.380 --> 31:07.380
By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt for sale now.

31:07.620 --> 31:09.620
At Wild Womine Workshop.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.620
And Megan is not much better.

31:11.620 --> 31:16.620
Like, there's this whole section in episode two where Megan interviews Christians who

31:16.620 --> 31:22.620
burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s, and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.

31:22.620 --> 31:28.120
So, looking back, would you say that the Christian parents were maybe part of a moral panic?

31:28.120 --> 31:29.120
Yeah, absolutely.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.120
It's a scary world out there.

31:31.120 --> 31:36.260
Megan doesn't explicitly say she thinks trans protests against Joe Rowe are equivalent to

31:36.260 --> 31:36.900
the Christian ones in the 90s.

31:36.900 --> 31:40.900
But she does heavily imply it.

31:40.900 --> 31:46.540
There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets, which led many, including lifelong

31:46.540 --> 31:53.780
fans of her work, to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned, boycotted, and

31:53.780 --> 31:56.360
in some cases, burned.

31:56.360 --> 32:01.900
When confronted about the obvious implications of the podcast's title, Megan said,

32:01.900 --> 32:02.900
The title is ambiguous.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.900
Toward the end of our conversations, I spent a long time talking with Megan.

32:04.900 --> 32:05.900
She said,

32:05.900 --> 32:10.300
I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling about discernment, about how a person can

32:10.300 --> 32:14.900
ever know if they're standing up for what's right, or joining a moral panic.

32:14.900 --> 32:18.900
I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.900
Megan, I was not surprised.

32:21.900 --> 32:24.900
I know I won't ever regret having stood up on this issue.

32:24.900 --> 32:25.900
Ever.

32:25.900 --> 32:30.100
The podcast released new episodes weekly, and whenever Megan was challenged about the

32:30.100 --> 32:32.900
blatant one-sidedness, Megan would respond,

32:32.900 --> 32:33.900
Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?

32:33.900 --> 32:34.900
Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?

32:34.900 --> 32:37.660
Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?

32:37.660 --> 32:38.660
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

32:38.660 --> 32:39.820
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

32:39.820 --> 32:40.820
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

32:40.820 --> 32:41.820
Much more of Other Perspectives is coming, make sure to tune in next week.

32:41.820 --> 32:42.820
Much more of Other Perspectives is coming, make sure to tune in next week.

32:42.820 --> 32:43.820
Make sure to tune in next week.

32:43.820 --> 32:44.820
More bombshell revelations to come.

32:44.820 --> 32:45.820
Make sure to tune in next week.

32:45.820 --> 32:46.820
More bombshell revelations to come.

32:46.820 --> 32:47.820

32:47.820 --> 32:48.820
More bombshell revelations to come.

32:48.820 --> 32:49.820
Make sure to tune in next week.

32:49.820 --> 32:50.820
Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now, and I truly do not think that anyone with

32:50.820 --> 32:51.820
Google thôi basis media comprehension skills could come away from this thinking that the

32:51.820 --> 32:52.820
main intent was anything other than to portray J.K. Rowling as him.

32:52.820 --> 32:58.240
And I truly do not think that anyone with basic media comprehension skills

32:58.240 --> 33:02.780
could come away from this thinking that the main intent was anything other

33:02.780 --> 33:11.020
than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr of an unjust, uh, what's the word?

33:12.140 --> 33:12.840
Witch hunt?

33:13.060 --> 33:18.360
This is the obvious implication of the podcast from the first words to the very last.

33:18.660 --> 33:22.080
And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.

33:22.080 --> 33:24.960
The final episode concludes with this.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.220
There are more important things in this world than being popular.

33:29.380 --> 33:31.820
And that doesn't mean it's more important to me to be right.

33:33.000 --> 33:35.500
It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.

33:35.940 --> 33:37.820
Why would you end on that note?

33:38.440 --> 33:41.840
Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is

33:41.840 --> 33:47.040
if Megan didn't fundamentally believe that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?

33:47.600 --> 33:49.540
I don't regret it because I did the right thing.

33:49.540 --> 33:52.000
Like there really is no other reasonable way

33:52.000 --> 33:53.200
to interpret this.

33:53.380 --> 33:55.720
So I wish that she would just be honest.

33:56.120 --> 34:00.560
If you believe that J.K. Rowling is the misunderstood victim of a witch hunt,

34:01.060 --> 34:02.520
then just say that.

34:02.880 --> 34:05.020
Make the argument you want to make.

34:05.240 --> 34:08.640
Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,

34:08.920 --> 34:12.620
this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.

34:13.060 --> 34:16.520
Don't rely on innuendo and framing and

34:16.520 --> 34:21.220
lachrymose Gregorian chanting to make your point.

34:21.220 --> 34:21.700
Well,

34:22.000 --> 34:26.880
don't go around coyly denying you have any kind of agenda beyond.

34:27.240 --> 34:29.940
I just believe in conversation.

34:29.960 --> 34:30.720
I don't know.

34:31.000 --> 34:34.540
I just find this a slippery and dishonest way to argue.

34:34.640 --> 34:38.680
But if you happen to be a fan of slippery and dishonest arguments,

34:38.780 --> 34:43.880
you're in luck because there is more where that came from.

34:45.640 --> 34:48.260
This video is sponsored by Cannabox.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.640
Cannabox offers fresh human meat

34:50.660 --> 34:51.720
delivered directly to your doorstep.

34:51.720 --> 34:57.300
As an alphabet mafiosa, sometimes I just can't fit the most dangerous game into my busy lifestyle

34:57.300 --> 34:59.660
of destroying the family and recruiting children.

35:00.320 --> 35:05.680
Whenever a new box arrives, I get out my copy of Bless This Food, the Anita Bryant family

35:05.680 --> 35:06.300
cookbook.

35:06.820 --> 35:10.600
The best thing about human meat delivered to your home by mail in the dead of night?

35:10.600 --> 35:16.180
You don't know who you're eating, so it's totally guilt-free and ethically sourced.

35:16.680 --> 35:16.940
Maybe.

35:17.500 --> 35:19.720
There's no ethical consumption under capitalism.

35:19.720 --> 35:22.080
Listen, that means you're not allowed to cancel me.

35:22.340 --> 35:25.520
Chapter four, Joe Rowe's transphobia.

35:26.520 --> 35:27.120
That's it.

35:29.840 --> 35:31.500
I'm going full Slytherin.

35:31.720 --> 35:37.120
In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling, Joe Rowe compares trans activists

35:37.120 --> 35:40.900
to Death Eaters, the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.

35:41.220 --> 35:48.620
My position is that this activist movement, in the form that it's currently taking, echoes

35:48.620 --> 35:49.700
the very thing that I was doing.

35:49.720 --> 35:51.200
I was warning against in Harry Potter.

35:51.620 --> 35:56.340
The Death Eaters claimed we have been made to live in secret, and now is our time.

35:56.720 --> 36:02.720
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

36:02.960 --> 36:07.880
When an article then claimed she had equated trans people to Death Eaters, the podcast's

36:07.880 --> 36:10.700
PR firm reached out, demanding a correction.

36:11.020 --> 36:16.620
Because she only equated the movement to Death Eaters, not trans people in general.

36:17.040 --> 36:18.760
Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people.

36:18.760 --> 36:19.520
I just hate it.

36:19.520 --> 36:21.420
I hate it when they advocate for themselves.

36:21.420 --> 36:26.260
So I do have to be very careful with my wording here, lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.

36:26.260 --> 36:30.980
J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with, because she expresses it as an endless

36:30.980 --> 36:34.760
series of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.

36:34.760 --> 36:39.760
A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle consisting of a Mott, that

36:39.760 --> 36:45.880
is, a tower atop a mound or hill, easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard that's

36:45.880 --> 36:49.160
much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.

36:49.520 --> 36:53.540
The Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes a provocative claim that's difficult

36:53.540 --> 36:54.840
to defend.

36:54.840 --> 36:55.900
The Bailey.

36:55.900 --> 37:01.020
And then, when confronted with counter-arguments, they walk it back to a much less controversial

37:01.020 --> 37:03.700
and easy-to-defend version of the claim.

37:03.700 --> 37:04.920
The Mott.

37:04.920 --> 37:10.700
For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim like, sex is real.

37:10.700 --> 37:12.360
What does she mean by that?

37:12.360 --> 37:13.360
What are the implications?

37:13.360 --> 37:19.360
Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks it's very sinister that in the Associated

37:19.360 --> 37:25.500
Press style guide, it says that instead of referring to a trans woman as a man who identifies

37:25.500 --> 37:29.680
as a woman, journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.500
That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.

37:33.500 --> 37:38.960
They've edged from identifies as a woman, so a man identifies as a woman, which, and

37:38.960 --> 37:42.280
I think we all understand what that means, into is a woman.

37:42.280 --> 37:46.660
And that's precisely the creep that I'm talking about.

37:46.660 --> 37:48.680
We are using language to...

37:48.680 --> 37:54.540
To make accurate definition of sex difference unspeakable.

37:54.540 --> 38:00.480
Which is of course false, because the words trans and cis exist precisely to make it easy

38:00.480 --> 38:02.500
to talk about sex difference.

38:02.500 --> 38:03.500
Thanks a lot, Tumblr.

38:03.500 --> 38:08.180
God, there's this whole section of the podcast that sort of implies that transgender people

38:08.180 --> 38:13.580
were invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even gonna get into because we don't have time.

38:13.580 --> 38:17.500
Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks that all people who menstruate must be referred

38:17.500 --> 38:18.660
to as women.

38:18.680 --> 38:19.680
Or was it wombin?

38:19.680 --> 38:21.480
I'm pretty sure it was wompmud.

38:21.480 --> 38:27.720
So trans men and transmasculine people, they're all women and must be referred to as women.

38:27.720 --> 38:29.920
Because J.K. Rowling demands it.

38:29.920 --> 38:31.960
This is controversial, right?

38:31.960 --> 38:35.060
Calling trans women men who identify as women.

38:35.060 --> 38:36.660
Calling trans men women.

38:36.660 --> 38:39.920
This is the Bailey in her Mott and Bailey argument.

38:39.920 --> 38:41.180
Trans women are men.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.180
Trans men are women.

38:42.180 --> 38:45.540
That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.

38:45.540 --> 38:48.540
Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash...

38:48.680 --> 38:51.640
Rowling walks the argument back and says,

38:51.640 --> 38:56.660
I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being

38:56.660 --> 38:59.220
female has shaped our lives.

38:59.220 --> 39:03.640
Women should be allowed to discuss how being female has shaped our lives.

39:03.640 --> 39:09.000
This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial interpretation of sex is real.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.000
The Mott.

39:10.000 --> 39:14.980
And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes make about trans people follows

39:14.980 --> 39:15.980
this pattern.

39:15.980 --> 39:16.680
J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstadter, said,

39:16.680 --> 39:17.680
I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being

39:17.680 --> 39:18.680
female has shaped our lives.

39:18.680 --> 39:19.680
I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being

39:19.680 --> 39:20.680
female has shaped our lives.

39:20.680 --> 39:21.680
J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstadter, will tweet inflammatory things like,

39:21.680 --> 39:22.680
Men cannot change into women.

39:22.680 --> 39:27.680
But then when she's criticised, she'll say that she's being attacked for gender-critical

39:27.680 --> 39:28.680
belief.

39:28.680 --> 39:35.160
Gender-critical belief, which is absolutely ordinary belief about sex that your mother

39:35.160 --> 39:37.080
and your grandmother are women.

39:37.080 --> 39:39.080
That being female is a thing.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.920
Your mother and grandmother are women.

39:41.920 --> 39:43.580
Being female is a thing.

39:43.580 --> 39:45.640
That's literally all I'm saying.

39:45.640 --> 39:47.640
But if that's literally all she was saying...

39:47.680 --> 39:50.860
then no one would be mad, would they?

39:50.860 --> 39:52.600
Nine, gnar.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.900
Men cannot change into women, is the Bailey.

39:55.900 --> 39:58.540
Your mom is a woman, is the Mott.

39:58.540 --> 39:59.800
Your mom's a woman.

40:01.200 --> 40:03.900
This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.

40:03.900 --> 40:06.780
They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,

40:06.780 --> 40:08.700
exhibitionists, and voyeurs.

40:08.700 --> 40:11.580
Then when trans people understandably get mad,

40:11.580 --> 40:13.780
they'll say, look, I'm being attacked

40:13.780 --> 40:17.160
just for saying that being female is part of my experience.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.180
It's dishonest.

40:18.180 --> 40:20.260
They talk a bunch of trash about trans people,

40:20.260 --> 40:22.300
and then when trans people talk trash back,

40:22.300 --> 40:23.940
they pretend that they're being victimized

40:23.940 --> 40:26.080
for making totally innocuous statements.

40:26.080 --> 40:29.760
We could name this behavior the birthday boy argument.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.680
I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt

40:31.680 --> 40:33.840
every jacked 6'3 bro he met

40:33.840 --> 40:36.420
until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up,

40:36.420 --> 40:39.620
whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on.

40:39.620 --> 40:40.740
I'm a little guy.

40:40.740 --> 40:41.920
I'm just a little guy.

40:41.920 --> 40:44.520
No, it's also my birthday.

40:44.520 --> 40:46.360
I'm a little birthday boy.

40:46.360 --> 40:47.120
And somehow, it always happens.

40:47.120 --> 40:47.960
It always worked.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.500
So a birthday boy argument

40:49.500 --> 40:52.440
is when you make aggressive, inflammatory assertions,

40:52.440 --> 40:56.220
followed by, teacher, teacher, look what he's doing to me,

40:56.220 --> 40:57.220
when the target reacts

40:57.220 --> 40:59.460
with anything less than extreme politeness.

40:59.460 --> 41:00.900
Another common tactic you'll see

41:00.900 --> 41:03.440
any time Rowling's transphobia is discussed

41:03.440 --> 41:05.260
is you'll see someone jump in to say,

41:05.260 --> 41:08.520
show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.

41:08.520 --> 41:10.660
For example, here's someone on Twitter

41:10.660 --> 41:12.960
called Large Gamete Producer.

41:12.960 --> 41:16.020
It's funny, isn't it, how these people will insist

41:16.020 --> 41:19.940
that awkward, inclusive language like people who menstruate

41:19.940 --> 41:22.140
is horribly oppressive and degrading,

41:22.140 --> 41:24.020
but then they'll just straight up call themselves

41:24.020 --> 41:26.620
Large Gamete Producer,

41:26.620 --> 41:29.540
which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.

41:29.540 --> 41:33.540
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

41:33.540 --> 41:34.380
Oh, I like it.

41:34.380 --> 41:35.720
It's very broodmother.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.580
That Rowling's words regularly appear

41:37.580 --> 41:40.660
in gender-critical arguments shows the massive influence

41:40.660 --> 41:42.900
that she has in the anti-trans movement.

41:42.900 --> 41:45.860
She's like their queen, their leader, their headmistress.

41:45.860 --> 41:48.100
She's the best thing that ever happened to them.

41:48.100 --> 41:50.340
Because Sheila Jeffries certainly wasn't persuading

41:50.340 --> 41:51.180
a lot of people.

41:51.180 --> 41:52.240
If you know, you know.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.400
Large Gamete Producer says,

41:54.400 --> 41:56.460
GK isn't anti-trans.

41:56.460 --> 42:00.020
Give me just one direct quote that she has said

42:00.020 --> 42:01.440
which is anti-trans.

42:01.440 --> 42:02.740
Oh, what's that?

42:02.740 --> 42:04.280
You can't find one?

42:04.280 --> 42:06.500
Well, color me shocked.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.340
Imagine.

42:07.340 --> 42:09.680
Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,

42:09.680 --> 42:13.200
let's take a look at Large Gamete Producer's profile.

42:13.200 --> 42:15.740
Trans women are not women, they are men.

42:15.860 --> 42:18.520
Trans men are not men, they are women.

42:18.520 --> 42:19.900
Nothing can change that.

42:19.900 --> 42:22.300
Sex is binary.

42:22.300 --> 42:25.420
Like if this person doesn't think that trans women are men,

42:25.420 --> 42:28.780
trans men are women is a transphobic statement,

42:28.780 --> 42:31.440
then what would they consider a transphobic statement?

42:31.440 --> 42:33.660
This is why the first question you should always ask

42:33.660 --> 42:36.780
such people is, do you believe that transphobia

42:36.780 --> 42:38.500
is a legitimate concept?

42:38.500 --> 42:40.180
What are some examples of statements

42:40.180 --> 42:42.240
that you would consider transphobic?

42:42.240 --> 42:44.740
Because many of them don't believe that transphobia

42:44.740 --> 42:45.700
is a valid concept.

42:45.700 --> 42:47.760
Because they don't think that trans people

42:47.760 --> 42:49.380
are a legitimate minority.

42:49.380 --> 42:50.880
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.040
There's no such thing as a trans person.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.000
There is no such thing.

42:54.000 --> 42:56.900
There are people that call themselves these things

42:56.900 --> 43:00.180
that may have other issues manifesting

43:00.180 --> 43:02.260
that then make them think they're this, but no.

43:02.260 --> 43:04.940
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

43:04.940 --> 43:06.700
There may be more words that we have to say

43:06.700 --> 43:07.640
in order to say that.

43:07.640 --> 43:09.960
We may call it transgender ideology,

43:09.960 --> 43:11.500
but when it comes to a person,

43:11.500 --> 43:13.980
they may be following transgender ideology,

43:13.980 --> 43:15.500
but they are not transgender.

43:15.500 --> 43:18.100
There is no such thing as a man or a woman

43:18.100 --> 43:20.300
being anything other than a man or a woman.

43:20.300 --> 43:22.640
So when they say, show me an example

43:22.640 --> 43:25.340
of something transphobic JK Rowling has said,

43:25.340 --> 43:26.600
this is a trap.

43:26.600 --> 43:27.820
They're just messing with you.

43:27.820 --> 43:29.880
There's nothing that she could have said

43:29.880 --> 43:31.940
that they would acknowledge as transphobic.

43:31.940 --> 43:34.020
Now, if you're someone who believes that transphobia

43:34.020 --> 43:35.260
is a valid concept,

43:35.260 --> 43:38.300
and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,

43:38.300 --> 43:40.260
but you just genuinely are unaware

43:40.260 --> 43:42.580
of what JK Rowling has said on the topic,

43:42.580 --> 43:45.360
then I will refer you to my past video on JK Rowling,

43:45.360 --> 43:48.580
rather than recapping it all here.

43:48.580 --> 43:51.240
Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse

43:51.240 --> 43:52.580
since I made that video.

43:52.580 --> 43:54.400
I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.

43:54.400 --> 43:57.520
True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people,

43:57.520 --> 43:59.340
because she's not a complete idiot,

43:59.340 --> 44:02.140
but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.380
She said, save our children.

44:04.380 --> 44:05.840
I love homosexuals.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.780
For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke

44:07.780 --> 44:10.020
doesn't say, I hate black people,

44:10.020 --> 44:12.260
but he will share a lot of statistics

44:12.260 --> 44:14.140
about anti-white crime.

44:14.140 --> 44:15.000
So this is not really,

44:15.000 --> 44:19.600
a very good criterion for deciding who's a bigot, is it?

44:19.600 --> 44:22.480
What JK Rowling does do is tweet again and again

44:22.480 --> 44:24.320
about transgender rapists,

44:24.320 --> 44:27.180
about the danger trans women pose to cis women.

44:27.180 --> 44:29.340
She implies that trans-inclusive language

44:29.340 --> 44:32.640
is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.

44:32.640 --> 44:35.940
She writes at length about the vague nefarious cabal

44:35.940 --> 44:38.100
of endocrinologists and ideologue

44:38.100 --> 44:40.520
that is supposedly persuading

44:40.520 --> 44:43.480
confused vulnerable girls to transition.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.220
To quote Washington Post opinion,

44:44.220 --> 44:46.580
writer Monica Hess,

44:46.580 --> 44:48.820
I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,

44:48.820 --> 44:50.480
but reading her Twitter feed,

44:50.480 --> 44:52.200
this is the overall effect.

44:52.200 --> 44:55.160
Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think.

44:55.160 --> 44:57.020
It asks them to fear.

44:57.020 --> 45:01.300
It creates phobias of trans people.

45:01.300 --> 45:06.300
It creates trans-phobias, if you will.

45:06.400 --> 45:08.700
Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician,

45:08.700 --> 45:12.920
Nicola Sturgeon, calling her a destroyer of women's rights

45:12.920 --> 45:14.060
via a t-shirt.

45:14.060 --> 45:17.100
This is what she got from anti-trans hate-monger Posey Parker.

45:17.100 --> 45:18.600
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

45:18.600 --> 45:20.760
There's no such thing as a trans person.

45:20.760 --> 45:21.720
There is no such thing.

45:21.720 --> 45:24.380
If there's one thing that I want people to understand

45:24.380 --> 45:26.080
about Rowling's transphobia,

45:26.080 --> 45:29.140
it's that this is not a case of someone posting

45:29.140 --> 45:30.720
a couple insensitive tweets

45:30.720 --> 45:32.380
that got blown out of proportion.

45:32.380 --> 45:36.320
Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent of trans rights.

45:36.320 --> 45:39.320
This has been her main issue for several years now.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.580
And because she's so famous,

45:41.580 --> 45:43.460
she's become the de facto global champion,

45:43.460 --> 45:44.020
of trans women.

45:44.020 --> 45:46.580
A champion of backlash to trans rights.

45:46.580 --> 45:49.180
Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.

45:49.180 --> 45:52.060
Except worse, because she's way more famous

45:52.060 --> 45:55.180
and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.

45:55.180 --> 45:58.520
Rowling has also praised self-described theocratic fascist,

45:58.520 --> 46:01.400
Matt Walsh, for his transphobic propaganda film.

46:01.400 --> 46:05.340
She refers to trans women as trans-identified males,

46:05.340 --> 46:08.080
known as Tims, among people for whom this has become

46:08.080 --> 46:09.240
an unhealthy obsession.

46:09.240 --> 46:11.420
She retweets images of the trans colors

46:11.420 --> 46:13.420
being erased from the progress flag.

46:13.420 --> 46:15.720
Also, the colors representing queer people of color.

46:15.720 --> 46:17.080
So, you know, great.

46:17.080 --> 46:17.860
Love that.

46:17.860 --> 46:20.580
Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic

46:20.580 --> 46:24.100
for the principled and valiant purpose of defending lesbians.

46:24.100 --> 46:26.360
It's something of a fixation for her.

46:26.360 --> 46:28.460
I find this particularly gross,

46:28.460 --> 46:30.960
because it plays into the lesbophobic trope

46:30.960 --> 46:33.620
that gay women are especially anti-trans,

46:33.620 --> 46:36.720
when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic

46:36.720 --> 46:37.720
of cis people.

46:37.720 --> 46:40.400
According to a survey of young adults in the UK,

46:40.400 --> 46:43.220
lesbians were most likely to know a trans person,

46:43.420 --> 46:46.680
and also most likely, at 96%,

46:46.680 --> 46:48.060
to say that they're supportive,

46:48.060 --> 46:50.260
or very supportive of trans people.

46:50.260 --> 46:53.680
So I think it's fair to say that most gay women

46:53.680 --> 46:55.960
are probably not super thrilled

46:55.960 --> 46:59.660
whenever Joe Rowe, the lesbian defender, logs on.

46:59.660 --> 47:01.720
My own partner is a cis lesbian,

47:01.720 --> 47:04.180
and I asked her if she enjoys JK Rowling

47:04.180 --> 47:07.520
defending her from the transsexuals, and she said,

47:07.520 --> 47:10.340
It makes me want to gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.

47:10.340 --> 47:13.220
By the way, here is JK Rowling enjoying a bit

47:13.220 --> 47:16.780
of banter with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,

47:16.780 --> 47:19.400
the co-founder of Rowling's charity, Lumos.

47:19.400 --> 47:21.320
Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member

47:21.320 --> 47:23.640
of the House of Lords who voted against

47:23.640 --> 47:26.060
same-sex marriage in 2013.

47:26.060 --> 47:29.120
In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,

47:29.120 --> 47:31.240
claiming that gay marriage would lead to

47:31.240 --> 47:34.300
degrading the status of women and girls.

47:34.300 --> 47:37.320
Truly one of the great lesbian allies.

47:37.320 --> 47:39.900
And in 2022, here is JK Rowling

47:39.900 --> 47:42.340
joking around with Lady Nicholson.

47:42.340 --> 47:43.060
Excellent question.

47:43.060 --> 47:43.900
Emma.

47:43.900 --> 47:47.280
Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women

47:47.280 --> 47:51.120
excludes and depresses the most marginalized of all groups,

47:51.120 --> 47:55.520
i.e. people with penises and beards who want to shag women.

47:55.520 --> 47:58.780
And before you say, but aren't they straight men?

47:58.780 --> 48:01.840
They're wearing eyeliner, bigot.

48:01.840 --> 48:05.320
Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia you may have

48:05.320 --> 48:07.120
for the Gryffindor common room,

48:07.120 --> 48:09.760
and just look at this interaction for what it is.

48:09.760 --> 48:13.040
Two straight women, one of whom is a homophobic peer

48:13.040 --> 48:16.140
of the realm, having a nice little chuckle together

48:16.140 --> 48:19.220
about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.

48:19.220 --> 48:20.800
So that's it, right?

48:20.800 --> 48:21.700
It's over.

48:23.700 --> 48:24.920
Case closed.

48:27.240 --> 48:28.920
I still like hammering things.

48:30.380 --> 48:33.220
I'm not gonna argue anymore about whether JK Rowling

48:33.220 --> 48:36.940
is transphobic, because anyone who believes in transphobia

48:36.940 --> 48:39.660
can see that obviously she is.

48:39.660 --> 48:42.880
The question now is whether transphobia is the sort of

48:42.880 --> 48:45.380
thing that progressives can denounce,

48:45.380 --> 48:48.400
the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,

48:48.400 --> 48:50.360
misogyny, and homophobia.

48:50.360 --> 48:51.940
That's usually what we're talking about

48:51.940 --> 48:54.140
when we talk about JK Rowling, right?

48:54.140 --> 48:56.980
Whether it's fair to cancel her.

48:56.980 --> 49:00.480
That's what the witch trials of JK Rowling is about.

49:00.480 --> 49:03.920
The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.

49:03.920 --> 49:06.700
Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint

49:06.700 --> 49:09.620
worthy of polite consideration and respect

49:09.620 --> 49:11.760
in liberal, humane society?

49:11.760 --> 49:12.660
Or, is it just an option?

49:12.660 --> 49:13.960
Or is it just an ugly prejudice

49:13.960 --> 49:16.060
that we can justifiably react to

49:16.060 --> 49:18.040
with scorn and condemnation?

49:18.040 --> 49:20.120
And there's an even broader question here

49:20.120 --> 49:23.660
about whether we can justifiably react to anything

49:23.660 --> 49:25.520
with scorn and condemnation.

49:25.520 --> 49:27.920
Is canceling ever warranted?

49:27.920 --> 49:32.260
Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?

49:32.260 --> 49:35.840
Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices

49:35.840 --> 49:39.320
a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas

49:39.320 --> 49:42.200
where we can all sit around debating the legitimacy

49:42.200 --> 49:46.220
of gay marriage or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?

49:46.220 --> 49:48.960
Is the final solution a myth promulgated

49:48.960 --> 49:50.840
by the international Jew?

49:50.840 --> 49:54.380
Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?

49:54.380 --> 49:57.240
Wouldn't the taxpayers save a lot of money

49:57.240 --> 49:59.720
if there weren't so many disabled people?

49:59.720 --> 50:00.760
Who knows?

50:00.760 --> 50:02.340
These are open questions.

50:02.340 --> 50:06.300
Let's sit down with people on both sides, on many sides,

50:06.300 --> 50:09.160
and have calm, civil conversations about it

50:09.160 --> 50:11.600
for the rest of our goddamn lives.

50:12.200 --> 50:14.280
Five, debate.

50:16.220 --> 50:18.200
Sar, I know I did this look before

50:18.200 --> 50:21.480
and it's like not related to the video topic at all,

50:21.480 --> 50:23.320
but it just makes me feel slithing.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.620
The boy who slithed.

50:25.620 --> 50:27.860
So Megan Phelps-Roberts' viewpoint seems to be

50:27.860 --> 50:31.140
that scorn and condemnation are never appropriate,

50:31.140 --> 50:33.040
that we should approach every conflict

50:33.040 --> 50:34.640
with empathy and compassion,

50:34.640 --> 50:36.540
even when dealing with the worst,

50:36.540 --> 50:39.540
most destructive people in the world.

50:39.540 --> 50:40.980
Hi, my name is Megan,

50:40.980 --> 50:41.980
and my heretical friend, Megan Phelps, is a gay man.

50:41.980 --> 50:43.960
My heretical belief is that even the people

50:43.960 --> 50:46.040
who seem to be the worst,

50:46.040 --> 50:48.100
most destructive people in the world

50:48.100 --> 50:51.660
are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy

50:51.660 --> 50:53.600
if we want to find a way to change their minds.

50:53.600 --> 50:55.800
In her book, in her TED Talk,

50:55.800 --> 50:57.660
in her public appearances,

50:57.660 --> 50:59.640
Megan expresses the idea

50:59.640 --> 51:02.640
that society has recently become polarized

51:02.640 --> 51:05.000
in some unprecedented way,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.540
that we've all become extremists,

51:07.540 --> 51:10.380
that in some sense, we've all become

51:10.380 --> 51:11.760
the Westboro Baptist Church.

51:11.980 --> 51:14.660
I can't help but see in our public discourse

51:14.660 --> 51:17.200
so many of the same destructive impulses

51:17.200 --> 51:19.000
that ruled my former church.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.260
She identifies things like certainty,

51:21.260 --> 51:23.300
vilification of compromise,

51:23.300 --> 51:25.160
us versus them thinking,

51:25.160 --> 51:26.880
suppression of empathy,

51:26.880 --> 51:29.440
and celebration of death and misfortune

51:29.440 --> 51:33.020
as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.

51:33.020 --> 51:34.840
And this really bothers Megan,

51:34.840 --> 51:37.620
because she claims that a decade ago,

51:37.620 --> 51:39.180
when she went on Twitter to tweet about

51:39.180 --> 51:41.860
how marriage is abominable to God,

51:41.980 --> 51:44.580
it was people who engaged her in a civil,

51:44.580 --> 51:47.660
rational way that eventually led her

51:47.660 --> 51:50.220
to renouncing Westboro's ideology.

51:50.220 --> 51:54.160
And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.920
She's totally right that if you want

51:55.920 --> 51:57.500
to change people's minds,

51:57.500 --> 52:00.300
then approaching them with compassion and empathy

52:00.300 --> 52:02.920
is usually the best way to do that.

52:02.920 --> 52:04.860
But Megan reaches another conclusion

52:04.860 --> 52:06.300
that I don't agree with,

52:06.300 --> 52:09.700
which is that because compassion and civil conversation

52:09.700 --> 52:11.700
are most likely to persuade people,

52:11.700 --> 52:14.400
we should never cancel anyone,

52:14.400 --> 52:16.760
even the most horrible bigots.

52:16.760 --> 52:20.420
And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point.

52:20.420 --> 52:23.140
But what Megan means is we shouldn't say mean things

52:23.140 --> 52:23.980
to bigots.

52:23.980 --> 52:26.540
We shouldn't boycott or counter-protest

52:26.540 --> 52:28.180
or raise our voices.

52:28.180 --> 52:31.000
We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone,

52:31.000 --> 52:34.140
because that's just not how you change minds.

52:34.140 --> 52:36.080
And I get why Megan thinks this, right?

52:36.080 --> 52:38.940
De-radicalization was a really important part

52:38.940 --> 52:40.560
of her life experience.

52:40.560 --> 52:41.340
She's also clearly holding out

52:41.340 --> 52:43.520
hope that other members of her family

52:43.520 --> 52:46.260
will leave Westboro and have a life on the outside.

52:46.260 --> 52:48.560
She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.

52:48.560 --> 52:50.820
The last lines of her book address her family.

52:50.820 --> 52:52.760
"'I want to tell them that I love them.

52:52.760 --> 52:54.760
I'll just have to find another way.'"

52:54.760 --> 52:56.680
This is touching and human

52:56.680 --> 52:59.740
and also kind of a conflict of interest.

52:59.740 --> 53:03.500
The problem is Megan's views about this only makes sense

53:03.500 --> 53:07.340
if you assume that Megan is the main character of reality.

53:07.340 --> 53:10.580
If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots

53:10.580 --> 53:13.860
is more important than protecting the people they target.

53:13.860 --> 53:16.420
Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds

53:16.420 --> 53:19.920
is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.

53:19.920 --> 53:23.320
As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old

53:23.320 --> 53:25.620
and she's still homophobic.

53:25.620 --> 53:27.740
But even without Anita's blessing,

53:27.740 --> 53:31.120
gay rights have still somehow managed to progress

53:31.120 --> 53:32.760
since the 1970s.

53:32.760 --> 53:36.720
Because gay activists didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.

53:36.720 --> 53:38.960
They needed to defeat her.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.340
And that's what they did.

53:40.580 --> 53:42.820
We have to accept that realistically,

53:42.820 --> 53:46.340
persuading all the bigots is just not an option.

53:46.340 --> 53:49.700
Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,

53:49.700 --> 53:51.820
but there will always be bigots.

53:51.820 --> 53:55.300
And mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them

53:55.300 --> 53:58.100
is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.

53:58.100 --> 54:00.940
Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,

54:00.940 --> 54:05.180
we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?

54:05.180 --> 54:06.020
Gnar.

54:06.020 --> 54:09.300
You would only think that if you're a total moral relativist.

54:09.300 --> 54:09.860
I guess controversial opinions are the only way to do that.

54:09.860 --> 54:13.360
It's not a controversial opinion, but bigotry is shameful.

54:13.360 --> 54:14.820
And it should be shamed.

54:14.820 --> 54:15.820
I'll say it.

54:15.820 --> 54:19.300
You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas in your head,

54:19.300 --> 54:22.220
you might feel afraid to express them publicly

54:22.220 --> 54:25.240
for fear of being shamed or judged.

54:25.240 --> 54:28.260
Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia

54:28.260 --> 54:30.740
that punishes people for wrong-think?

54:30.740 --> 54:34.460
No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful

54:34.460 --> 54:36.100
and you should be ashamed of it

54:36.100 --> 54:38.700
and the people judging you are right to do so.

54:38.700 --> 54:39.700
And sure, there are some very, very, very, very,

54:39.700 --> 54:42.620
very patient people who devote their lives

54:42.620 --> 54:44.380
to de-radicalizing bigots,

54:44.380 --> 54:47.680
which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.

54:47.680 --> 54:49.380
There's a guy named Daryl Davis

54:49.380 --> 54:51.840
who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan

54:51.840 --> 54:53.300
for over 30 years,

54:53.300 --> 54:57.200
and he claims he's convinced more than 200 of them to leave.

54:57.200 --> 54:58.540
And good for him.

54:58.540 --> 55:01.320
De-radicalization is a valid strategy,

55:01.320 --> 55:03.760
but it cannot be the only strategy

55:03.760 --> 55:06.960
and it must not be the primary strategy.

55:06.960 --> 55:09.140
Because we're not going to defeat racism

55:09.140 --> 55:12.840
by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.

55:12.840 --> 55:15.100
Feminists would be wasting their time

55:15.100 --> 55:18.160
trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.

55:18.160 --> 55:20.580
In general, I think that the massive effort

55:20.580 --> 55:23.340
that it takes to maybe persuade bigots

55:23.340 --> 55:26.100
is better spent persuading other people

55:26.100 --> 55:27.540
not to listen to them.

55:27.540 --> 55:30.520
And it's also worth cautioning that de-radicalization

55:30.520 --> 55:33.760
is often a messy and incomplete process.

55:33.760 --> 55:36.860
20-year-old white nationalist Peter Sejtanovic

55:36.860 --> 55:39.020
became the face of the fascist Unite the Right,

55:39.020 --> 55:41.460
the right rally in 2017

55:41.460 --> 55:45.920
when a photo of him mid-scream, tiki torch in hand,

55:45.920 --> 55:48.980
was published in news outlets all over the country.

55:48.980 --> 55:51.280
Peter was unrepentant in interviews

55:51.280 --> 55:53.600
he gave immediately after the rally,

55:53.600 --> 55:55.960
but he began to question his beliefs

55:55.960 --> 55:58.620
after befriending a Muslim woman who,

55:58.620 --> 56:00.960
according to Charlotte MacDonald Gibson,

56:00.960 --> 56:03.720
challenged his views without insulting him,

56:03.720 --> 56:07.100
allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.

56:07.100 --> 56:08.780
Peter is no longer a white nationalist,

56:08.780 --> 56:11.400
but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out

56:11.400 --> 56:13.100
every trace of bigotry.

56:13.100 --> 56:16.160
In a 2019 interview with the London School of Economics

56:16.160 --> 56:18.220
student paper, Peter said,

56:18.220 --> 56:20.340
I don't like the whole transgender thing.

56:20.340 --> 56:22.540
You're born either a man or a woman.

56:22.540 --> 56:26.420
So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.

56:26.420 --> 56:29.220
When I did de-radicalization work on YouTube,

56:29.220 --> 56:32.120
I used to get some criticism from people of color

56:32.120 --> 56:34.300
who were not thrilled that I was bringing

56:34.300 --> 56:37.800
a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,

56:37.800 --> 56:38.260
a frustration that I don't like, but I do like.

56:38.260 --> 56:38.760
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.

56:38.780 --> 56:39.280
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.

56:39.280 --> 56:39.780
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.

56:39.780 --> 56:40.280
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.

56:40.280 --> 56:43.120
To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,

56:43.120 --> 56:47.400
diverse leftist communities are maybe not the best holding space

56:47.400 --> 56:48.400
for someone who's

56:48.400 --> 56:50.560
a bit of a Nazi but working on it.

56:50.560 --> 56:52.740
In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,

56:52.740 --> 56:55.820
I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,

56:55.820 --> 56:59.720
but what she does have is a kind of hypervigilant skepticism

56:59.720 --> 57:03.180
about anything she perceives as ideology.

57:03.180 --> 57:04.720
This is pretty common with people

57:04.720 --> 57:07.160
who used to be religious fundamentalists.

57:07.160 --> 57:08.260
They were so certain they were right,

57:08.260 --> 57:11.760
only to realize that everything they believed

57:11.760 --> 57:13.420
about the world is wrong.

57:13.420 --> 57:17.420
So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions

57:17.420 --> 57:20.500
because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.

57:20.500 --> 57:21.940
Coming from Westboro,

57:21.940 --> 57:25.660
where I believed so strongly that I was doing the right thing

57:25.660 --> 57:27.420
and then to leave and come to believe

57:27.420 --> 57:29.620
that it was so destructive and harmful,

57:30.800 --> 57:35.800
I had this moment in time and it lasted for many months

57:35.800 --> 57:37.380
where I was like,

57:37.380 --> 57:39.820
how can I ever trust my own mind again?

57:39.820 --> 57:43.240
This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,

57:43.240 --> 57:47.220
but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else

57:47.220 --> 57:48.760
can cause problems,

57:48.760 --> 57:52.440
especially where topics of social justice are concerned.

57:52.440 --> 57:55.560
Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism

57:55.560 --> 57:56.560
that asks,

57:56.560 --> 58:01.540
why are marginalized people so unwilling to have calm,

58:01.540 --> 58:04.760
philosophical debates about whether they should have rights?

58:04.760 --> 58:07.220
Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?

58:07.220 --> 58:10.140
Atheist philosopher Sam Harris,

58:10.140 --> 58:12.740
in his podcast about Megan's podcast,

58:12.740 --> 58:15.120
can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?

58:15.120 --> 58:18.640
I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts

58:18.640 --> 58:20.800
until we can figure out what's going on.

58:20.800 --> 58:24.460
Sam Harris, in his podcast about Megan's podcast,

58:24.460 --> 58:28.600
complained that trans activism and activism in general

58:28.600 --> 58:32.860
is plagued by mental illness and hysteria.

58:32.860 --> 58:35.860
I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.

58:35.860 --> 58:36.700
I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.

58:36.700 --> 58:37.200
I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.

58:37.220 --> 58:42.760
and even frank mental illness in the activist community.

58:42.760 --> 58:45.900
I mean, in really in all activist communities.

58:45.900 --> 58:51.100
The level of viciousness and hysteria is,

58:51.100 --> 58:53.300
you know, it's hard to know what to compare it to.

58:53.300 --> 58:55.160
Diversity when...

58:55.160 --> 58:58.180
Man accuses trans women of being hysterical.

58:58.180 --> 59:02.080
Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions

59:02.080 --> 59:05.820
when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?

59:05.820 --> 59:07.200
Aren't there certain situations

59:07.200 --> 59:09.380
where strong emotions are warranted?

59:09.540 --> 59:11.300
It reminds me of this awful episode

59:11.300 --> 59:13.620
of Joe Rogan feat Ben Shapiro,

59:13.900 --> 59:16.720
where little Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral

59:16.720 --> 59:19.040
with his usual whining sophistry.

59:19.380 --> 59:21.360
And Joe gently raises objections

59:21.360 --> 59:23.340
for Ben to talk circles around.

59:23.640 --> 59:27.060
The human sex drive was made to procreate

59:27.060 --> 59:28.420
within a stable relationship

59:28.420 --> 59:30.360
in order to progenerate

59:30.360 --> 59:31.840
and have future generations of people.

59:32.260 --> 59:34.080
Misuse of that sex drive in any way,

59:34.180 --> 59:36.460
whether you're talking about from masturbation

59:36.460 --> 59:37.760
to homosexual activity,

59:38.400 --> 59:40.840
is therefore a diminishment of the use of that drive.

59:40.920 --> 59:43.940
That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.

59:44.020 --> 59:47.360
All of the top comments on this video are like this.

59:47.540 --> 59:49.160
Imagine talking about different beliefs

59:49.160 --> 59:51.060
while still having a productive conversation.

59:51.360 --> 59:53.320
Things progress when you don't demonize people.

59:53.480 --> 59:54.860
The discussion here was excellent.

59:55.060 --> 59:56.560
Two guys with opposing opinions,

59:56.800 --> 59:59.240
speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,

59:59.460 --> 01:00:02.060
shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.

01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:03.800
This is how it should be done.

01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.280
Kudos to both of them.

01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.440
Joe is a great interviewer.

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.000
He can totally disagree with someone

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.060
and still have a calm, collective conversation.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.440
This is how it should be.

01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.100
Just two people sharing ideas,

01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:14.860
learning different point of views from each other.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:17.000
This is why Joe is the number one podcast.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.320
Joe Rogan beautifully asked the tough questions.

01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:20.700
And Ben answers honestly.

01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.320
He is strong in his faith.

01:00:22.560 --> 01:00:25.340
I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:26.760
and they have a civil conversation.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:27.740
Great learning.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:30.680
And like, yeah, it's easy for two straight men

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:33.880
to have a dispassionate theoretical conversation

01:00:33.880 --> 01:00:36.220
about the ethics of homosexuality.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.180
Because it's not their lives

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.880
and their relationships that are up for debate.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.080
These people don't understand the emotional burden

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.820
placed on marginalized people

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:48.280
who are asked to defend their rights.

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.420
Like, if you're straight,

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.060
do you want to publicly debate

01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:53.920
whether your marriage is valid?

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.980
Andrew Dworkin claimed that

01:00:55.980 --> 01:00:57.960
penetrative heterosexual intercourse

01:00:57.960 --> 01:01:00.180
is inherently an act of violence.

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.460
I've noticed that most straight men

01:01:02.460 --> 01:01:06.060
don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:06.440
So if you're straight,

01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:07.820
imagine how they'd react

01:01:07.820 --> 01:01:10.160
if there was a powerful political movement

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:12.060
to criminalize penetration

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.060
or revoke their right to marry.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:16.320
Add in a lifetime of ostracism,

01:01:16.620 --> 01:01:17.500
family rejection,

01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.400
bullying, and discrimination,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.660
and maybe then you'll begin to understand

01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.500
the hysteria of a lot of queer people.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.560
It is my right to raise my child

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:28.760
with the moral precept

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.060
that I find to be beneficial for my child.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.300
Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.

01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.500
And if he tries,

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:35.740
I will meet him at the door with a gun.

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.380
That is insane.

01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:39.720
Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:42.040
because he can't handle the debate.

01:01:42.220 --> 01:01:45.100
Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:48.300
Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.960
about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:52.020
I now have two choices.

01:01:52.160 --> 01:01:53.860
One is to leave the country utterly.

01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:55.080
Two is to pick up a gun.

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.760
Those are the only choices that you have left me.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.500
Dave Rubin is a gay conservative

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:02.060
whose career requires that he convince

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:05.640
his right-wing audience that he's one of the good ones.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:06.260
This means that he's not the only one

01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:07.980
who's willing to sit across

01:02:07.980 --> 01:02:09.520
from his so-called friend,

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.540
homophobe Ben Shapiro,

01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:13.280
and listen to Ben say

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.900
he would never attend his anniversary party

01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.040
because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.920
There's a difference between me

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.380
just being friends with Dave

01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:25.940
and me actively participating in an event

01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:27.920
that I feel is religiously sinful.

01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.420
The two of them then congratulate themselves

01:02:30.420 --> 01:02:33.160
about how they can still be great friends.

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.840
Why is it that we're able to do this?

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:35.880
Why is it that we're able to do this?

01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:37.500
And most people can't do this.

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:38.700
That's what I'm curious about.

01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.620
We go home at night and we can have our own lives.

01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:43.060
And here's Dave having a civil conversation

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.880
with conservative Glenn Beck,

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.720
who compares homosexuality to alcoholism

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:49.340
and then congratulates himself

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.400
on having the conversation.

01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:53.660
I'm a deeply religious man

01:02:53.660 --> 01:02:55.880
and my religion says

01:02:55.880 --> 01:02:57.780
man and a woman,

01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:01.400
that is the basic building block of family.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:03.480
And that's what I believe,

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.480
but I also am,

01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:10.100
and I also know God created you

01:03:10.100 --> 01:03:11.740
just like he created me,

01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.080
flaws and all.

01:03:13.860 --> 01:03:16.860
You know, I believe I have a gene,

01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:17.760
they've never found it,

01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:21.300
that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism

01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:23.100
because it runs in my family.

01:03:23.660 --> 01:03:24.600
So does craziness,

01:03:24.720 --> 01:03:26.480
but it runs in my family.

01:03:26.780 --> 01:03:28.840
Well, Dave smiles and nods,

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:30.640
probably because he's thinking about

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.900
how much he enjoys the taste of boots.

01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:36.240
Usually I just take out a picture

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:39.020
of me and DeSantis and then we're good

01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:41.200
because they get it, they get it,

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:42.860
that's my governor, yeah.

01:03:43.020 --> 01:03:45.540
I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:47.640
and they see, finally,

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:49.960
a reasonable gay person

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:51.080
who doesn't scream,

01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.880
beg it, at everyone who disagrees

01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.620
and can actually have a civil conversation.

01:03:56.980 --> 01:03:58.340
But that's not what I see.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:03:59.740
I look at Dave Rubin

01:03:59.740 --> 01:04:02.000
and I see a sabineless,

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.900
boot-licking doormat

01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:05.960
who won't even defend his own family.

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:06.060
who won't even defend his own family.

01:04:06.060 --> 01:04:06.820
who won't even defend his own family.

01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:09.600
from the most fundamental disrespect.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.440
I also can't help but notice

01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:14.220
that none of these civil conversations

01:04:14.220 --> 01:04:16.560
seem to change anyone's mind.

01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.940
Persuasion is more complicated

01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.440
and less rational than people think.

01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:25.180
Megan often says that she was de-radicalized on Twitter,

01:04:25.180 --> 01:04:27.300
but if you read her book carefully,

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:30.100
you'll notice that that's not exactly true.

01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:31.900
The major precipitating event

01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:33.820
for Megan's crisis of faith

01:04:33.820 --> 01:04:35.760
was her mother's mistreatment

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:38.420
at the hands of an increasingly misogynistic

01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.840
church leadership

01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:42.460
that made Megan feel like she was the victim

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.800
of the church for once.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:45.960
She says of the church discipline,

01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:47.960
For the first time in my life,

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.800
the accused were people I lived with

01:04:49.800 --> 01:04:51.380
and knew most intimately,

01:04:51.380 --> 01:04:52.800
and I knew that the judgments

01:04:52.800 --> 01:04:54.680
leveled by the elders were wrong.

01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:56.560
I could no longer blindly trust

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.300
the judgment of these men.

01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:01.000
So she finally experienced firsthand

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.600
what it's like to be the victim of her family.

01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:05.600
She stopped voting for the leopards-eating,

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.220
people's faces party

01:05:07.220 --> 01:05:09.640
only when the leopards ate her face.

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.900
It also seems relevant to notice

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.840
that the people who had calm, civil conversations

01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:18.440
with Megan on Twitter were generally not gay people,

01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:21.640
the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.

01:05:21.640 --> 01:05:23.560
They were mostly straight men,

01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.800
like director Kevin Smith,

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:28.220
who started hashtag SaveMegan

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.680
because, quote, she's hot.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:35.300
There's often an erotic component to persuasion,

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:38.220
and that certainly seems to be the case with Megan

01:05:38.220 --> 01:05:42.000
because one of the people who helped de-radicalize her

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.760
is now her husband.

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.960
And I feel like that's a relevant detail

01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:49.180
if we're trying to understand the role of reason and emotion

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:51.680
in de-radicalization experiences.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:53.960
I think this experience is usually more

01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.380
akin to religious conversion

01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:58.600
than it is to logical reasoning.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.140
There's also a world of difference

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.760
between the mostly private conversations

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.920
that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs,

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.920
and the spectacle of public debate.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:11.340
Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic

01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:15.300
because he livestreamed a civil conversation with Dave Rubin.

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:17.880
So who is this conversation even for?

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:20.460
Well, obviously, it's for the audience.

01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:24.720
I think these civil conversations basically function

01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:27.460
to reassure a homophobic audience

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:31.580
that just because they disagree with the lifestyle

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:34.380
doesn't mean that they hate gay people.

01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.760
Look at Ben Shapiro.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.540
He is friends with a gay.

01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:40.580
Public debate is one way that we define the limits

01:06:40.580 --> 01:06:42.140
of the Overton window,

01:06:42.140 --> 01:06:45.760
the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.

01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.140
So often people who want to promote bigotry

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:51.380
will use debate as a foot in the door.

01:06:51.380 --> 01:06:54.220
It's a way of establishing that their prejudices

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.220
are within the realm of reasonable

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:58.300
and socially accepted opinion.

01:06:58.300 --> 01:07:02.000
Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot Graham Linehan

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.920
in a fury that a drag queen,

01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:06.500
that a drag queen is on Doctor Who

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:10.040
without the British public having a proper debate

01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.420
about these issues.

01:07:11.420 --> 01:07:14.720
Now, why do we need to have a proper debate

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.540
about whether drag queens should be allowed on television

01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:20.920
when drag performance has been a staple

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.460
of British entertainment

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.920
since at least the time of Shakespeare?

01:07:24.920 --> 01:07:27.000
Life is a joke, that's just begun.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, high five.

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:31.580
Three little maids from school.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.040
Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.

01:07:33.920 --> 01:07:35.920
As I am man,

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:41.680
my state is desperate for my master's love.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.920
As I am woman, now alas the day.

01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:49.120
Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate

01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:50.680
on their own terms

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.840
because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.880
It's how they convince the public

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:59.380
that their moral panic about drag queens on TV

01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.800
is actually a valid concern.

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.540
Rather than the tedious,

01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:07.160
small-minded whining about nothing that it really is.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.960
Having the debate on a bigot's terms

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:12.540
is not a good way to win people over

01:08:12.540 --> 01:08:14.300
unless you're really skilled

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:16.460
in the art of humiliating people,

01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:19.160
which most of the time is what public debate

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:20.700
is actually about.

01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.340
This is something that J.K. Rowling

01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:24.240
doesn't seem to understand.

01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:26.380
In the witch trials of J.K. Rowling,

01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:30.580
Joro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.

01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:33.300
She brings up right-wing provocateur,

01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.600
Milo Yiannopoulos,

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:38.180
saying that activists are making a strategic error

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:42.060
and giving Milo power by protesting his events,

01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.060
making him look dangerous and sexy.

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:48.000
But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.960
Rowling characterizes this as silencing.

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.420
So is deplatforming a strategic error

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.680
that gives power to your opponent,

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.260
or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?

01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.720
I find Rowling's conviction

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.960
that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.260
really out of touch.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:06.000
Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:07.180
for the things he does.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:10.540
He has strategies for humiliating people.

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.460
I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:14.540
being fabulous and doing my hair,

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:15.880
to prepare a speech for you.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:17.260
Well, a few remarks, really.

01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:21.220
Feminism is cancer.

01:09:21.220 --> 01:09:22.600
Thank you very much.

01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.640
To again quote Ian Danskin,

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:26.800
you can't really reason with someone

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.180
who thinks that feminism is cancer,

01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:31.340
because you don't reason with cancer.

01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.600
You eradicate it.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.760
Rowling objects to the slogan,

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:37.640
no debate, in the strongest possible terms.

01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:40.720
And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.760
the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.520
We hear it all the time.

01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:49.300
That alarms me, really alarms me.

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:52.680
I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism

01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.560
than no debate.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:54.720
It's kind of amazing to me

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:57.680
that someone could think angry trans people on Twitter

01:09:57.680 --> 01:10:00.840
are the purest example of authoritarianism.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.440
I truly hope that one day,

01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:06.400
I am privileged enough to be capable of such a perspective.

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.780
Before I move on, I do want to clarify

01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:11.680
that I do think there are trans issues

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:15.280
that are legitimately debatable by people who are not bigots.

01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.940
In my opinion, trans women and women's sports

01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:20.400
is one of those issues.

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.820
But it's a complicated issue.

01:10:22.820 --> 01:10:26.740
Like, first of all, which sport are we talking about?

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.900
Are we talking about figure skating?

01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:30.940
Middle school field hockey?

01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.680
I see no reason why trans women and women's sports,

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:34.640
I see no reason why trans girls should be excluded from that.

01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.180
But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.220
well, then it seems plausible that trans women

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:42.060
who have been through male puberty

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:45.440
may still retain some kind of group advantage.

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:49.180
But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.

01:10:49.180 --> 01:10:51.220
People are transitioning younger now,

01:10:51.220 --> 01:10:53.560
and that's another thing you have to consider.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:56.480
So I'm not against debating this issue.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:00.480
I just want people to approach it with nuance and good faith.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.640
And currently, I'm not against it.

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:04.220
A lot of the people who are vocally against

01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:08.020
trans women and women's sports sound like this.

01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:12.300
And we will keep men out of women's sports.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:14.520
Right?

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.760
How ridiculous.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.720
That will take place on day one.

01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.480
And I don't want to debate those people.

01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:25.220
I want to serve them a banana creme pie.

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.840
Chapter 6. Illiberal Methods.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.520
One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints about men being too aggressive is that,

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:37.880
the trans rights movement is she sees it as illiberal in its methods so when i first became

01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:45.240
interested and then deeply troubled by what i saw as a cultural movement that was illiberal

01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:51.560
in its methods so what are these illiberal methods if you are saying this person is

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:59.640
cancelled that is the language of a dictator it's true cancel culture is exactly how the third reich

01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:05.960
started first they cancelled the socialists and i did not speak out because the hashtag was trending

01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.760
but maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.840
you know i can't help but wonder what counts as acceptable activist methods

01:12:28.840 --> 01:12:29.620
to an author from

01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:37.640
whom hermione protesting slavery was taking things too far i am fighting what i see as a powerful

01:12:37.640 --> 01:12:45.480
insidious misogynistic movement i do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless

01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:50.040
rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement is dangerous and authoritarian

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:55.320
in some unprecedented way that makes it different from all past liberation movements

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:58.840
but how what are these illiberal methods that distinguish trans

01:12:58.840 --> 01:13:04.860
rights activism from similar past movements canceling anita bryant was way more cancelled

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:10.680
than jk rowling ever will be boycotts boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement

01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.280
in modern history disrupting feminist meetings disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist

01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:22.600
tradition haven't you heard of the lavender menace in 1969 betty friedan author of the feminine mystique

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.480
and founder of the national organization for women and second wave feminism in general coined the

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:28.680
phrase lavender menace

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:33.000
to describe the threat she believed that lesbians posed

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.260
to the women's movement.

01:13:34.260 --> 01:13:37.680
Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians

01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:39.580
would make it easy to dismiss the movement

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.600
as a bunch of mannish man-haters.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.500
This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:48.220
who attended the second Congress to Unite Women in 1970

01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:50.880
to stage what used to be known as a ZAP,

01:13:50.880 --> 01:13:54.100
a disruptive public protest designed to draw attention

01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.540
to gay rights issues.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:57.720
Think glitter bombing, think pies.

01:13:57.720 --> 01:13:59.560
Half aggression, half whimsy.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.720
Like that time the Lesbian Avengers zapped

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:04.120
Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house,

01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.520
demanding that she resign.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.560
This podcast has pushed me over the edge.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.100
Centrism has gone too far, and I am now pro-cancel culture.

01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:13.020
So just as the meeting was beginning,

01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:16.460
a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts

01:14:16.460 --> 01:14:19.440
switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic,

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:22.260
and charged down the aisles, laughing and screaming.

01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:25.060
Their leader, Rita Mae Brown, took the mic and yelled,

01:14:25.060 --> 01:14:26.960
"'This conference won't proceed

01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:27.720
"'until we talk about it.'

01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.760
"'Let's talk about lesbians and the women's movement.'"

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.840
One of the NOW organizers yelled back,

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:34.760
"'I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.560
"'You're acting like men.'"

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.340
Betty Friedan would later speculate

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:40.680
that the lesbians were a CIA PSYOP

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:43.180
designed to make the women's movement look bad.

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:46.100
So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting

01:14:46.100 --> 01:14:47.920
using illiberal tactics,

01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:50.060
not because they were against feminism,

01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:53.060
but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:54.100
to include them.

01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.680
It's the same thing that's happening today

01:14:55.680 --> 01:14:57.680
when trans people disrupt feminist meetings.

01:14:57.720 --> 01:14:59.380
As J.K. Rowling puts it,

01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:01.260
interestingly neglecting to mention

01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.220
which feminist meetings these are.

01:15:03.220 --> 01:15:05.560
I was starting to see activists behaving

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:08.340
in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.

01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:11.140
There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging

01:15:11.140 --> 01:15:13.800
and kicking on windows, very threatening.

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:17.020
There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea

01:15:17.020 --> 01:15:20.020
that trans activists are somehow more aggressive

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.800
than similar past movements.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.920
Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:26.340
called Dennis Noel Kavanaugh, who says,

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:27.560
all those gay rights movements,

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.020
gay rights and AIDS protests,

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.360
I don't remember a single one

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.320
where we intimidated or silenced a woman.

01:15:34.320 --> 01:15:36.600
Not a single one.

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.800
Not a single one.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.440
Not a single one.

01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:45.440
Not a single one.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.140
Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.520
to the trans movement.

01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:53.140
And also, quote,

01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:55.600
I will fucking nail you to a wall

01:15:55.600 --> 01:15:57.320
what you have done to these innocent women.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.700
what you have done to these innocent women.

01:15:58.700 --> 01:16:01.820
Your mutilation of these little humand

01:16:01.820 --> 01:16:03.820
because they were gay will be nothing

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:08.360
compared to what I will do to you legally.

01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:10.080
You think you are ghouls,

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:13.860
wait till I deal with you bastard and I mean to.

01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:16.860
Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.

01:16:16.860 --> 01:16:19.900
I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people

01:16:19.900 --> 01:16:23.200
to a wall count as illiberal methods?

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:25.280
I guess JK Rowling doesn't think so

01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:26.780
because she's never condemned it.

01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:29.440
In fact, when Dennis's Twitter suspension ended,

01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:31.620
she was right there to welcome him back.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.400
And she continues to retweet him.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:35.080
I've always been happy to acknowledge

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.080
that angry trans people on Twitter

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:39.080
sometimes take things too far.

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:42.320
Things like death threats or misogynistic insults,

01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:45.020
I don't support that and I've called it out in the past.

01:16:45.020 --> 01:16:47.820
Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,

01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:49.980
drama alert, who is not trans,

01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:51.400
tweeted at JK Rowling,

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.860
women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.

01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:56.620
I called him out, tweeting,

01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:00.120
doing edgy, ironic misogyny while defending trans people

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.740
magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say

01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:05.580
about there being misogyny in trans activism.

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.620
I tweeted that because I recognize

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:09.820
that if people who are claiming to speak for you

01:17:09.820 --> 01:17:12.120
are doing so in a misogynistic way,

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:13.860
and if you let that slide,

01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:15.420
you're going to wake up one day to find

01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:17.460
that you're in a misogynistic movement.

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.920
Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well,

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.700
explaining that actually,

01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:25.080
I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:26.460
for the moral necessity of being trans.

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.420
Being misogynistic to JK Rowling.

01:17:28.420 --> 01:17:30.840
And then he accused me of cancel culturing him

01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:31.840
while at the same time,

01:17:31.840 --> 01:17:34.620
literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.

01:17:34.620 --> 01:17:37.580
The more of you were in the replies being like,

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.080
that's not what's happening right here.

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.260
Like this is necessary, okay?

01:17:41.260 --> 01:17:45.880
Publicly shame her into changing her mind on this.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.340
Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.

01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:52.260
Move you off this site and into,

01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:54.000
I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.

01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.300
So that pretty much confirmed to me that Vosh doesn't

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.640
actually care about advocating for trans people

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.920
and just uses trans rights as a pretext

01:18:00.920 --> 01:18:02.380
to act like a fucking dingus.

01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:04.380
I won't tell you to publicly shame him though,

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:07.180
because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.

01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:09.800
The point I'm trying to make is I have no qualms

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.000
about calling out people on my side

01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.420
whenever they go too far or cross a line

01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:16.600
or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:19.300
about how I don't understand tactical misogyny.

01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:20.140
Idiot.

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.260
But the same cannot be said of JK Rowling.

01:18:22.260 --> 01:18:25.720
I have never once seen her call out any of the bigotry and

01:18:25.720 --> 01:18:28.520
abusiveness that is absolutely rampant

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.260
in the gender-critical movement.

01:18:30.260 --> 01:18:33.520
There's a great video called JK Rowling's New Friends

01:18:33.520 --> 01:18:36.380
by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty

01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:40.180
of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:42.480
versus the abusive trans mob.

01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.560
A framing that the witch trials of JK Rowling accepts

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.800
uncritically, citing numerous examples of death threats

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:51.060
and abusiveness from trans advocates.

01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:54.300
Things like, kill TERFs 2014.

01:18:54.300 --> 01:18:55.480
How about slowly

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:57.280
and horrendously murder TERFs

01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:00.180
in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?

01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:01.820
Now, I don't think anyone should joke

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.900
about putting people in saw traps,

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:06.560
but also, how serious is this threat

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:09.560
that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:11.780
Let's use our critical thinking skills here.

01:19:11.780 --> 01:19:16.140
Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies,

01:19:16.140 --> 01:19:19.140
has a Tumblr account and is threatening TERFs?

01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:21.680
Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:25.320
The podcast cites zero examples of death threats and abusiveness

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.940
from anti-trans bigots.

01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:30.120
And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.

01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:33.400
I can fill the screen up with examples just from people

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:37.160
who JK Rowling has explicitly supported or interacted with.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:40.820
I will drive you out into the desert and bury you 9 feet down,

01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:43.440
one tweet says, from a fan of JK Rowling.

01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.080
First I'll set you on fire and piss on your half-alive corpse.

01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:51.200
Fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:55.160
Another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,

01:19:55.160 --> 01:19:55.200
another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:55.280
another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:55.320
another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:59.860
I don't know if I can even read it aloud without violating the YouTube terms of service.

01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:04.120
But threats like this from the gender critical side are simply not mentioned

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:06.120
in the witch trials of JK Rowling.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:10.200
Both Rowling and Megan seem happy to cherry-pick threatening tweets

01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.440
and soundbites of shouting protesters

01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:14.860
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!

01:20:14.860 --> 01:20:18.200
You look like you got your teeth knocked out of your fucking flashes!

01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.200
as evidence that the trans movement is dangerous and insidious to the core.

01:20:22.200 --> 01:20:25.200
But this exact technique has been used against literally

01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:28.080
every liberation movement in world history.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:31.580
For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night,

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:34.700
the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.780
which first got JK Rowling interested in feminism in the 1970s.

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:42.540
Here's how The Guardian, Britain's spineless centrist paper of note,

01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:45.900
covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.

01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:49.620
Chanting slogans against rape seems reasonable to promote awareness,

01:20:49.620 --> 01:20:53.000
but what about the hissing and swearing at any innocent male,

01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.160
and cries of castrate men?

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:59.160
We were all sympathetic to the principles of the women's liberation movement,

01:20:59.160 --> 01:21:03.660
but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women when it became clear

01:21:03.660 --> 01:21:09.160
that my friend's brother was running the risk of personal mutilation if he remained with us.

01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:11.160
The protesters were allegedly singing,

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:16.160
Here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.

01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:19.660
So this is how the British press covered the women's movement.

01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:22.160
Angry, torch-bearing women screaming,

01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:23.660
Castrate men!

01:21:23.660 --> 01:21:25.160
Now, is that a fair representation?

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:26.660
Of the women's movement?

01:21:26.660 --> 01:21:30.660
Should we judge every movement by its most militant extremists?

01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:34.160
Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanus,

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.160
who shot Andy Warhol,

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:41.160
who advocated for male extermination in her Society for Cutting Up Men manifesto,

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:43.660
is representative of feminism as a whole?

01:21:43.660 --> 01:21:47.160
Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.

01:21:47.160 --> 01:21:49.160
But it's not fair, is it?

01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:52.660
So why does JK Rowling think it's fair to judge the trans movement

01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:55.160
by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.160
I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.660
And I made excuses for you then.

01:21:59.660 --> 01:22:02.660
In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of JK Rowling,

01:22:02.660 --> 01:22:06.160
Megan interviews New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg,

01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:09.160
who has written sympathetically about transphobic feminism.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.160
There's a moment in this interview where Michelle kind of stumbles

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:15.660
into an honest observation that I find fascinating.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:18.160
Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say,

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:21.160
you know, I'm not going to debate my basic humanity.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.160
And part of the difficulty is that there are indeed certain issues

01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:27.160
which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:30.660
with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.

01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:34.660
And I think that part of what is so difficult about this issue

01:22:34.660 --> 01:22:37.660
is that there are certain people who think that this kind of consensus

01:22:37.660 --> 01:22:41.660
can be imposed, maybe, as opposed to evolve organically.

01:22:41.660 --> 01:22:47.660
And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up

01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:50.160
in the hopes, I think, that if they can,

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:54.160
they will enjoy the same sort of assumed

01:22:54.160 --> 01:22:57.160
protection as other groups whose rights we've decided

01:22:57.160 --> 01:23:00.660
are not up for public conversation.

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:03.660
I think the problem is that we don't actually have a consensus.

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.660
So Michelle correctly observes that the reason trans people

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:09.660
are often reluctant to debate our rights is that we want

01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:12.660
the same assumed protections as other groups whose rights

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.160
liberals have decided are not up for debate.

01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:20.160
But then Michelle suggests that trans people have to debate our rights

01:23:20.160 --> 01:23:24.160
because there isn't a mainstream consensus that we deserve rights.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:28.160
I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg thinks that past

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:30.160
liberation movements have succeeded.

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.160
Like, does she think that women's suffrage just evolved organically?

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:38.160
Did suffragettes just have calm, civil conversations about whether

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.160
women are intellectually capable of voting until all the misogynists

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.160
were rationally persuaded?

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:47.160
No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote,

01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:50.160
sometimes violently, especially in the UK.

01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:53.160
Like, people forget this, maybe because they were called suffragettes,

01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.160
which is kind of a cute thing.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.160
But the suffragettes, they murdered people.

01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.160
They were suffragette terrorists.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:00.160
They broke windows.

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.160
They bombed churches.

01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:03.160
They set fire to a theater.

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:08.160
In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill with a horse whip.

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:09.160
Queen shit, honestly.

01:24:09.160 --> 01:24:12.160
The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:14.160
at the Prime Minister's head.

01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:18.160
And my point is not to advocate terrorism or to excuse the terrorism

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:19.160
of past movements.

01:24:19.160 --> 01:24:22.160
I think these kinds of tactics have tended to turn people against

01:24:22.160 --> 01:24:23.160
the movement.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:24.160
I don't think it's effective.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:27.160
But let's not pretend that past movements have never made demands

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:29.160
before everyone was ready.

01:24:29.160 --> 01:24:32.160
Because there never has been and there never will be a time

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.160
when everyone is ready.

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:37.160
I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published The Vindication of the Rights

01:24:37.160 --> 01:24:39.160
of Women in 1792.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.160
And misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:46.160
So there never has been a consensus about women's rights,

01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:48.160
and there probably never will be.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:52.160
In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights if there was a consensus

01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:54.160
that we deserve rights.

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:57.160
The whole reason to have rights is to protect you from the kind of people

01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:59.160
who think you shouldn't have them.

01:24:59.160 --> 01:25:02.160
I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just politely persuade everyone

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.160
to give us rights, but the reality is that's not how this works,

01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:07.160
and it never has been.

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:10.160
Like, how do these debate me centrists think that slavery ended

01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.160
in the United States?

01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:17.160
Well, between 1861 and 1865, there was a little event called

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:19.160
the American Civil Debate.

01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:21.160
See what I'm holding in my hand?

01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:24.160
This is a high-caliber idea that I picked off

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.160
the polite discussion field of Manassas.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.160
Do you people think that American schools were integrated

01:25:29.160 --> 01:25:32.160
because all the white people in the South were persuaded

01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.160
that segregation is bad?

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:35.160
No dum-dums.

01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.160
Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne to enforce that shit

01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:39.160
at gunpoint.

01:25:39.160 --> 01:25:42.160
And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.160
with black civil rights.

01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:47.160
I am aware that being a white queer person is not in any way equivalent

01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:49.160
to living in the aftermath of slavery.

01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:51.160
I'm just saying that there's this tendency to

01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:54.160
sanitize history, and to imagine that progress was smooth

01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:58.160
and bloodless, that consensus evolved organically,

01:25:58.160 --> 01:25:59.160
when it just didn't.

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.160
And then people get the impression that current movements

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:05.160
are somehow more militant than successful past movements

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:07.160
when they just aren't.

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:11.160
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:15.160
misogynistic movement, a cultural movement that was

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:17.160
illiberal in its methods.

01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:21.160
And I believe absolutely that there is something

01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:26.160
dangerous about this movement, and it must be challenged.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:28.160
Why is J.K. Rowling like this?

01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:35.160
J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin,

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:38.160
whomst I've already mentioned a couple times in this video.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.160
I myself favor violence.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.160
Deeply, I favor it.

01:26:42.160 --> 01:26:45.160
Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views,

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:47.160
which I don't agree with.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:50.160
But she was an interesting writer, one of those half-crazed,

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:55.160
savantes who gets in your head, who you can't stop thinking about.

01:26:55.160 --> 01:26:59.160
In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right Wing Women,

01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:04.160
published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly and Anita Bryant.

01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:07.160
Right Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women

01:27:07.160 --> 01:27:12.160
are drawn to conservative politics, seemingly against their own interests.

01:27:12.160 --> 01:27:15.160
Anyone who's interested in understanding the gender-critical movement,

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:19.160
a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself as feminism,

01:27:19.160 --> 01:27:21.160
should read this book.

01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:22.160
In Dworkin's analysis,

01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:39.160
And conservative politics promises women meaning.

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:54.160
The gender-critical movement offers women a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.

01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:58.160
A woman is an adult human female.

01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:02.160
Right-wing anti-trans activist Posey Parker has made this phrase

01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:05.160
into the motto of the gender-critical movement.

01:28:05.160 --> 01:28:08.160
Adult human female.

01:28:08.160 --> 01:28:14.160
It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts, it's on banners, signs, and tweets.

01:28:14.160 --> 01:28:17.160
Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition,

01:28:17.160 --> 01:28:21.160
it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.

01:28:21.160 --> 01:28:24.160
There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines,

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.160
there can be no change.

01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:31.160
This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability and chaos

01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:33.160
that gender-criticals fear.

01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:37.160
The same fear that once drove homophobic women like Anita Bryant.

01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:40.160
Just biologically that God made mothers so that we could reproduce.

01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:43.160
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.160
Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability

01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:50.160
of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

01:28:50.160 --> 01:28:51.160
Dworkin says,

01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:53.160
Within the frame of male domination,

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:56.160
there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality,

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:57.160
both male and female.

01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:00.160
Women are interchangeable as sex objects.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:03.160
Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.

01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:06.160
The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.

01:29:06.160 --> 01:29:09.160
Having children is the one social contribution credited to women.

01:29:09.160 --> 01:29:12.160
It is the bedrock of women's social worth.

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:15.160
Without childbearing, women know they have nothing.

01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:17.160
Homosexuality for women means

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:19.160
having nothing. It means extinction.

01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.160
Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality

01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:25.160
and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.

01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:29.160
J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:33.160
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:36.160
The producer of the large gametes.

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:40.160
Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men

01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:42.160
is the loss of fertility.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:45.160
Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility,

01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:49.160
attempts to socially legitimize or protect it,

01:29:49.160 --> 01:29:51.160
makes women expendable.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.160
The one thing women can do and be valued for

01:29:53.160 --> 01:29:55.160
will no longer be valued.

01:29:55.160 --> 01:29:58.160
Male homosexuality is especially terrifying

01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:01.160
because it suggests a world without women altogether.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:03.160
A world in which women are extinct.

01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:08.160
This exact fear appears frequently in gender-critical rhetoric.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:10.160
Trans activists are erasing women.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:13.160
They're erasing biological sex.

01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.160
They're going to call us pregnant.

01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.160
Pregnant people.

01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:20.160
Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility.

01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.160
Trans women are going to replace biological women.

01:30:23.160 --> 01:30:26.160
As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men

01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.160
are aggressively replacing women.

01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.160
You will not replace us!

01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.160
Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:36.160
and the results can be...dazzling.

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:39.160
In September 2022, Maya Forstadter,

01:30:39.160 --> 01:30:41.160
who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist

01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:44.160
whom J.K. Rowling came out as a TERF to defend,

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:46.160
went on a full-blown Twitter rampage

01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:49.160
because the Hertfordshire County Libraries announced

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:53.160
they were changing their children's storytime mascot

01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:55.160
from the Bookstart Bear

01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:57.160
If you don't know where this is going, strap in!

01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:59.160
from the Bookstart Bear

01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:03.160
to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:05.160
called Tala.

01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.160
Are you enraged?

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:11.160
If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.

01:31:11.160 --> 01:31:13.160
Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother

01:31:13.160 --> 01:31:15.160
who referred to Talia

01:31:15.160 --> 01:31:16.160
Wait, wasn't it Tala?

01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:21.160
referring to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns,

01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:23.160
describing the mascot as

01:31:23.160 --> 01:31:26.160
ideological, creepy, and gaslighting.

01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:30.160
I cannot express how upset I feel.

01:31:30.160 --> 01:31:33.160
The library jumped in to clarify that Tala,

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.160
not Talia,

01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:35.160
isn't trans.

01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.160
They are an alien.

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:40.160
Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.

01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:42.160
Did it hatch from an egg?

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.160
Or was it born from a mama?

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:46.160
Some people tried to reason with Maya.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.160
There's an advantage in having a character

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.160
that isn't identifiably male or female,

01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:52.160
as it can be equally relatable to either sex

01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.160
and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:57.160
But Maya was not convinced.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:59.160
It seems highly unlikely that an alien

01:31:59.160 --> 01:32:03.160
that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.160
is not sexually reproducing.

01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:07.160
It's a relatable anthropomorphic character,

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.160
not a slime mold.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:11.160
I need to know

01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:13.160
how the alien fucks

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.160
right now.

01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:16.160
I said,

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:17.160
I need to know

01:32:17.160 --> 01:32:19.160
how the alien fucks

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:21.160
before I can show it

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.160
to my child.

01:32:26.160 --> 01:32:30.160
When Twitter understandably laughed it up at Maya's expense,

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:32.160
she just kept posting.

01:32:32.160 --> 01:32:33.160
And she posted hard.

01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:36.160
Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone post so hard.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:38.160
In a lengthy diatribe,

01:32:38.160 --> 01:32:40.160
Maya wrote about the miseries of new motherhood.

01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:42.160
You are in charge of a baby.

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.160
You have never done this before.

01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:46.160
You haven't had a good night's sleep for months

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.160
and won't for years.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.160
Everyone has an opinion

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.160
on what you are doing right and wrong,

01:32:50.160 --> 01:32:52.160
and you've become invisible.

01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:53.160
You had politics.

01:32:53.160 --> 01:32:54.160
You had a career.

01:32:54.160 --> 01:32:56.160
You had interests.

01:32:56.160 --> 01:32:57.160
You had a sex life.

01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.160
Now you have the daily needs

01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:01.160
of a completely dependent person,

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:02.160
and your world has shrunk.

01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.160
The fact that these men

01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.160
and the young women that cheer them on

01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:08.160
think this is so laughable

01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:10.160
reflects society's disdain.

01:33:10.160 --> 01:33:11.160
Disdain for mothers.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.160
This is what it means to say

01:33:13.160 --> 01:33:15.160
a woman is not a feeling or a costume.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:17.160
This is why the hub of the resistance

01:33:17.160 --> 01:33:19.160
is on Mumsnet.

01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:22.160
So, I am fascinated by this thread.

01:33:22.160 --> 01:33:24.160
I think it's one of the most revealing texts

01:33:24.160 --> 01:33:26.160
in gender-critical history.

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:27.160
Because you know what?

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:30.160
Maya Forsyter actually does

01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:32.160
have valid concerns.

01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:34.160
But the concerns she has that are valid

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.160
have nothing to do with trans people.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:38.160
And they definitely have nothing to do

01:33:38.160 --> 01:33:39.160
with an adorable,

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:41.160
adorable cartoon alien.

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:43.160
Honestly, reading this,

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.160
I have some concerns.

01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:46.160
Concerns like,

01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:48.160
where is Maya's husband?

01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:50.160
I know she has one.

01:33:50.160 --> 01:33:52.160
Isn't raising children supposed to be

01:33:52.160 --> 01:33:53.160
a mutual project?

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.160
No one should have to feel this alone,

01:33:56.160 --> 01:33:57.160
raising children.

01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.160
That is a valid concern.

01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:01.160
Oh my god, we actually found one.

01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:02.160
It's like finding El Dorado.

01:34:02.160 --> 01:34:04.160
A valid concern.

01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:06.160
A valid concern.

01:34:06.160 --> 01:34:08.160
Isn't what's going on here that Maya

01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:10.160
is taking legitimate feelings of being

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.160
overburdened and underappreciated

01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:14.160
and displacing those feelings onto

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:15.160
transgender people?

01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.160
This is exactly how the gender-critical

01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:18.160
movement recruits.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.160
By providing a scapegoat

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.160
to frustrated women.

01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:24.160
It's not your husband's neglect.

01:34:24.160 --> 01:34:26.160
It's not the increasing atomization of society.

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:28.160
It's not the indignities of aging.

01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:30.160
It's Tala,

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.160
the non-binary alien,

01:34:32.160 --> 01:34:34.160
with its dungarees and

01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:36.160
smug aura of gender neutrality.

01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:38.160
Mumsnet is the hub!

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.160
The hub of the resistance

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.160
to non-binary cartoons.

01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:43.160
It's too much.

01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:44.160
These people are too much.

01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.160
Okay, we have to be serious now.

01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:47.160
The political right also promises women

01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.160
safety and security.

01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:52.160
For women, the world is a very dangerous place.

01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.160
The right acknowledges the reality of danger,

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.160
the validity of fear.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:58.160
The right then manipulates the fear.

01:34:58.160 --> 01:35:00.160
Women fear and resent male violence,

01:35:00.160 --> 01:35:02.160
which they're most likely to experience

01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:04.160
from the men closest to them.

01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:07.160
Boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.

01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:10.160
They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:13.160
But the need to survive in a male-dominated society

01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.160
means that women's legitimate fears and resentments

01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.160
often cannot be directed at the men with power.

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:22.160
Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage

01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:24.160
and contempt they feel

01:35:24.160 --> 01:35:26.160
for the men who actually abuse them,

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.160
those close to them,

01:35:27.160 --> 01:35:29.160
and project it onto others.

01:35:29.160 --> 01:35:32.160
Those far away, foreign, or different.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:34.160
And this displacement of rage

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:36.160
is just transparently what's going on

01:35:36.160 --> 01:35:38.160
with J.K. Rowling.

01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:41.160
In her essay about sex and gender issues,

01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:44.160
Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning

01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:47.160
to be the son her father wanted.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:49.160
I really felt the rejection of my father,

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.160
and that is one of the things that maybe leads

01:35:51.160 --> 01:35:53.160
someone going into homosexuality.

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:55.160
And she describes the lingering trauma

01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.160
from her first violent marriage.

01:35:57.160 --> 01:35:59.160
The marriage at this point has turned very violent

01:35:59.160 --> 01:36:01.160
and very controlling.

01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:05.160
And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out

01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:07.160
against the transgender movement.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.160
If you try to understand this rationally,

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.160
it looks like a total non sequitur.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:14.160
But if you look at it emotionally,

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.160
there's a kind of logic to it.

01:36:16.160 --> 01:36:18.160
The existence of the dangerous outsider

01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:20.160
always functions for women simultaneously

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:24.160
as deception, diversion, painkiller, and threat.

01:36:24.160 --> 01:36:26.160
Women cling to irrational hatreds

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:28.160
focused particularly on the unfamiliar,

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.160
so that they will not murder their fathers,

01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:33.160
husbands, sons, brothers, lovers,

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.160
the men with whom they are intimate,

01:36:35.160 --> 01:36:37.160
those who do hurt them.

01:36:37.160 --> 01:36:40.160
In the 1970s, many conservative women

01:36:40.160 --> 01:36:43.160
displaced this rage onto lesbians,

01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:45.160
the threatening outsider of the day.

01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:49.160
Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977,

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:51.160
where she spoke to a lot of women

01:36:51.160 --> 01:36:53.160
about their fear of lesbians.

01:36:53.160 --> 01:36:55.160
Right-wing women consistently spoke to me

01:36:55.160 --> 01:36:58.160
about lesbians as if lesbians were rapists,

01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:00.160
certified committers of sexual assault

01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:01.160
against women and girls.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:04.160
To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous,

01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:07.160
experienced almost as a demonic sexual force

01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:09.160
hovering closer and closer.

01:37:09.160 --> 01:37:11.160
She was the dangerous intruder,

01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:14.160
encroaching, threatening by her very presence

01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:17.160
a sexual order that cannot bear scrutiny

01:37:17.160 --> 01:37:19.160
or withstand challenge.

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.160
It's almost surreal to read this

01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:23.160
because of how precisely it describes

01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:26.160
how gender criticals talk about trans women.

01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:28.160
Pronouns are like Rohypnol.

01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:30.160
They dull your defenses.

01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:32.160
They change your inhibitions.

01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.160
They're meant to.

01:37:33.160 --> 01:37:36.160
Now, it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:41.160
began as an offshoot of far-left lesbian separatism,

01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.160
with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979

01:37:45.160 --> 01:37:48.160
that transsexualism should be morally mandated

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.160
out of existence.

01:37:50.160 --> 01:37:53.160
But the gender critical movement was always destined

01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.160
to become a right-wing movement

01:37:55.160 --> 01:37:58.160
because it has the structure of a right-wing movement.

01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.160
Taking women's fear and rage toward familiar men

01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:05.160
and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:08.160
The momentum behind this is just too ripe an opportunity

01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.160
for conservatives to pass up.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160
As Dworkin says,

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:14.160
Because women so displace their rage,

01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:17.160
they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.160
Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.

01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:23.160
The right provides these symbols of danger

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.160
by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders

01:38:26.160 --> 01:38:27.160
as sources of danger.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:30.160
In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a trend.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.160
A keystone of Conservative Party platforms,

01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.160
both in the UK,

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:36.160
where Lee Anderson,

01:38:36.160 --> 01:38:38.160
Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party,

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:41.160
predicts that the next election will be won on

01:38:41.160 --> 01:38:44.160
Probably a mix of culture wars and trans debate.

01:38:44.160 --> 01:38:45.160
and in the US,

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:48.160
where the ACLU is currently tracking more than

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.160
450 anti-LGBT bills,

01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.160
including more than 130 gender-affirming care bans,

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.160
51 trans sports bans,

01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.160
40 drag bans,

01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:00.160
29 trans bathroom bans,

01:39:00.160 --> 01:39:01.160
and 24

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:04.160
and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law.

01:39:04.160 --> 01:39:07.160
Republicans have escalated anti-trans rhetoric

01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:09.160
to eliminationist extremes

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:12.160
that have most trans people in this country

01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:15.160
living in a constant state of fear for our future.

01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:18.160
Transgenderism must be eradicated

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.160
from public life entirely.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:22.160
The left is attacking our children,

01:39:22.160 --> 01:39:24.160
pushing sex talk,

01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:26.160
transgender extremism,

01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:28.160
and noxious politics in our schools.

01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:30.160
We should reject this demonic assault

01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:32.160
on the innocence of our children

01:39:32.160 --> 01:39:34.160
and stand fast against leftist efforts

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.160
to mutilate their bodies and minds.

01:39:37.160 --> 01:39:39.160
Stop confusing our babies

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:43.160
with your groomer gender ideologue.

01:39:43.160 --> 01:39:46.160
I will revoke every Biden policy

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:48.160
promoting the chemical castration

01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:51.160
and sexual mutilization

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:54.160
of our youth,

01:39:54.160 --> 01:39:57.160
and ask Congress to send me a bill

01:39:57.160 --> 01:39:59.160
prohibiting child sexual mutilation

01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.160
in all 50 states.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:04.160
On day one, I will revoke

01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:06.160
Joe Biden's cruel policies

01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:09.160
on so-called gender-affirming care.

01:40:09.160 --> 01:40:10.160
Ridiculous.

01:40:10.160 --> 01:40:12.160
I will sign a new executive order

01:40:12.160 --> 01:40:14.160
instructing every federal agency

01:40:14.160 --> 01:40:16.160
to cease all programs

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:18.160
that promote the concept of sex

01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:21.160
and gender transition at any age.

01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:23.160
A few gender criticals

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:24.160
still want to insist

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:26.160
they have nothing to do

01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.160
with right-wing anti-trans bigots.

01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:29.160
Like Helen Lewis.

01:40:29.160 --> 01:40:31.160
I mean, TERF is basically witch.

01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:33.160
Who attempts in her interview

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:35.160
in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:37.160
to distinguish between the transphobia

01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:38.160
of the far right

01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:39.160
and that of feminists.

01:40:39.160 --> 01:40:41.160
I think the hardest thing

01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.160
for outsiders to understand

01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:44.160
is that there are two different arguments going on.

01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:47.160
One is the traditional conservative right argument

01:40:47.160 --> 01:40:49.160
which is anti-LGBT.

01:40:49.160 --> 01:40:51.160
The other one is a criticism from the left

01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:53.160
in which it says

01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:56.160
sometimes male people and female people

01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.160
have different interests.

01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.160
No matter how the male people identify.

01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.160
But as a trans person,

01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:02.160
I don't care

01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:04.160
whether you justify your transphobia

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:06.160
in the name of protecting women

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:08.160
or protecting children.

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:10.160
Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.160
calling for transsexualism

01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:14.160
to be morally mandated out of existence

01:41:14.160 --> 01:41:17.160
or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:19.160
calling for transgenderism

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.160
to be eradicated from public life

01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:23.160
is the same repulsive bigotry to me.

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:24.160
And in any case,

01:41:24.160 --> 01:41:26.160
the gender critical movement

01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.160
has recently reached

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.160
an implicit consensus

01:41:29.160 --> 01:41:30.160
that they're mostly done

01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:32.160
pretending to be feminist.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:34.160
The rising star of the movement

01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:35.160
Posey Parker

01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:37.160
aka Kelly J. Keene-Minchel

01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.160
rejects feminism entirely.

01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:41.160
Do you call yourself a feminist now?

01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.160
No.

01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:43.160
Did you ever call yourself a feminist?

01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.160
I probably did for a short time.

01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:46.160
But so you wouldn't be

01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:48.160
like a Julie Bindel type feminist?

01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.160
No, well some feminists,

01:41:49.160 --> 01:41:50.160
I mean Julie Bindel

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.160
has been critical of mothers in the past

01:41:53.160 --> 01:41:55.160
and I think that's a theme

01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:56.160
flowing through feminism.

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:58.160
I'm not a feminist!

01:41:58.160 --> 01:41:59.160
I'm not a feminist!

01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:01.160
This is not Andrea Dworkin.

01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:03.160
This is Phyllis Schlafly.

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:05.160
Parker's campaign is currently funded

01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:07.160
by the right wing CPAC.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.160
CPAC came along

01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:10.160
and said that they would sponsor our events

01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.160
and cover all of our insurance

01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:14.160
throughout our whole trip

01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:16.160
which is really kind of them.

01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.160
But what we would need to do

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:19.160
is we would need to show

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:21.160
that we were working for them,

01:42:21.160 --> 01:42:22.160
working with them.

01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:24.160
She has no qualms about collaborating

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.160
with far right white nationalists.

01:42:26.160 --> 01:42:28.160
I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.

01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:30.160
Let me tell you what she's been saying.

01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.160
She's a Republican,

01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:35.160
but she, I agree with her wholeheartedly.

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:36.160
She's opposed abortion

01:42:36.160 --> 01:42:38.160
and contraception for teenagers.

01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:41.160
Why are we enabling children

01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:45.160
to take sometimes contraceptives

01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:47.160
that are quite harmful

01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:49.160
or access to abortion?

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:52.160
I think that we really need

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.160
to rethink all of this.

01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:56.160
I think parents need to take back

01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.160
control of their children.

01:42:57.160 --> 01:42:58.160
She's called trans people

01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:00.160
fools and perverts.

01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:03.160
Transgenderism is nuts.

01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:05.160
It's for fools and perverts.

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:07.160
She's denied that transgender

01:43:07.160 --> 01:43:09.160
is a legitimate concept.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:10.160
It's not a real thing.

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.160
There's no such thing

01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:12.160
as being born in the wrong body.

01:43:12.160 --> 01:43:14.160
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:16.160
There's no such thing as a trans person.

01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.160
There is no such thing.

01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:19.160
There are people that call themselves

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:22.160
these things that may have other issues

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.160
manifesting that then make them think

01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.160
they're this, but no.

01:43:25.160 --> 01:43:27.160
We have to stop using any words

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.160
like transgender.

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.160
There may be more words

01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:32.160
that we have to say in order to say that.

01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:34.160
We may call it transgender ideology,

01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:35.160
but when it comes to a person,

01:43:35.160 --> 01:43:38.160
they may be following transgender ideology,

01:43:38.160 --> 01:43:39.160
but they are not transgender.

01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:41.160
There is no such thing as a man

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:43.160
or a woman being anything other

01:43:43.160 --> 01:43:44.160
than a man or a woman.

01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:47.160
She's called trans women pedophiles.

01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:49.160
We know that if a man has a paraphilia

01:43:49.160 --> 01:43:51.160
of dressing as a woman,

01:43:51.160 --> 01:43:55.160
the most likely cross paraphilia is pedophilia.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:59.160
We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:01.160
They don't ever stop at one.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:03.160
She's said that each and every woman

01:44:03.160 --> 01:44:06.160
who stands in her way will be annihilated.

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:08.160
Each and every one of you women

01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:09.160
who stand in my way,

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:11.160
each and every one of you,

01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.160
let me just tell you,

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:14.160
you will be annihilated.

01:44:14.160 --> 01:44:16.160
She's called on armed men

01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:18.160
to enter women's restrooms

01:44:18.160 --> 01:44:20.160
to attack anyone they perceive

01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:22.160
as not a real woman.

01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:24.160
And men, for once,

01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:27.160
I'm talking to you.

01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:30.160
I'm talking about you dads

01:44:30.160 --> 01:44:32.160
who maybe carry,

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.160
I think that's what you say.

01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:36.160
I'm so done with the American lingo.

01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.160
Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.

01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:40.160
Maybe you consider yourself

01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:41.160
a protector of women.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:43.160
Maybe you're that sort of man.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:45.160
Maybe you have a daughter

01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.160
or a mother or a wife.

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:48.160
Maybe you have a sister.

01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:49.160
Maybe you just have some friends.

01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.160
Maybe you just think women are human

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160
and you don't need

01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:55.160
any absolute connection with them

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:58.160
to feel compelled to protect us.

01:44:58.160 --> 01:45:01.160
Um, I think you should start

01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:02.160
using women's toilets, men.

01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:04.160
And she's said that women

01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:06.160
who call themselves men

01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.160
should be sterilized,

01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:10.160
which seems to be a little bit in tension

01:45:10.160 --> 01:45:12.160
with JK Rowling's concern

01:45:12.160 --> 01:45:15.160
about the fertility of confused girls.

01:45:15.160 --> 01:45:16.160
You know, you might look

01:45:16.160 --> 01:45:18.160
at these differences of opinion

01:45:18.160 --> 01:45:20.160
between Rowling and Parker,

01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:22.160
little things like pro-feminist

01:45:22.160 --> 01:45:23.160
versus anti-feminist,

01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:25.160
left versus right,

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.160
pro-abortion versus anti-abortion,

01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.160
concern about trans men's fertility

01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:33.160
versus advocating forced sterilization

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.160
of trans men,

01:45:34.160 --> 01:45:36.160
against annihilating women

01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.160
who stand in your way

01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:40.160
versus pro-annihilating

01:45:40.160 --> 01:45:42.160
each and every woman

01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.160
who stands in your way.

01:45:43.160 --> 01:45:45.160
You might look at these differences

01:45:45.160 --> 01:45:46.160
and expect that these two women

01:45:46.160 --> 01:45:47.160
would be at odds.

01:45:47.160 --> 01:45:49.160
But they aren't.

01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:51.160
Because promoting anti-trans bigotry

01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:52.160
is a common cause

01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:54.160
that for both of them,

01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.160
trumps all else.

01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.160
In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster

01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.160
reading,

01:45:59.160 --> 01:46:01.160
I heart JK Rowling

01:46:01.160 --> 01:46:02.160
to be displayed at a railway station

01:46:02.160 --> 01:46:03.160
in Edinburgh.

01:46:03.160 --> 01:46:05.160
And Rowling has tweeted

01:46:05.160 --> 01:46:07.160
in defense of Parker numerous times

01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:09.160
and has modeled her t-shirts.

01:46:09.160 --> 01:46:12.160
So, the gender-critical movement

01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:14.160
started by lesbian separatists

01:46:14.160 --> 01:46:16.160
in the 1970s

01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:18.160
has finally passed into the hands

01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.160
of pound shop Ava Browns,

01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:22.160
as gender-critical lesbian Julie Bindle

01:46:22.160 --> 01:46:24.160
memorably described them.

01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:26.160
It's a movement that has no beliefs

01:46:26.160 --> 01:46:28.160
apart from a shared determination

01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:31.160
to reduce the number of trans people.

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:33.160
In the numbers we're currently seeing,

01:46:33.160 --> 01:46:35.160
particularly of young people coming forward,

01:46:35.160 --> 01:46:37.160
I find cause for doubt.

01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:39.160
In the meantime,

01:46:39.160 --> 01:46:40.160
while we're trying to get through

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.160
to the decision makers,

01:46:41.160 --> 01:46:43.160
we have to try to limit the harm.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:45.160
And that means reducing

01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:47.160
or keeping down the number of people

01:46:47.160 --> 01:46:48.160
who transition.

01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.160
And that's for two reasons.

01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.160
One of them is that every one of those people

01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:54.160
is a person who's been damaged.

01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:56.160
But the second one is every one of those people

01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.160
is basically,

01:46:59.160 --> 01:47:02.160
you know, a huge problem to a sane world.

01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:03.160
Like, if you've got people,

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.160
whether they're transitioned,

01:47:04.160 --> 01:47:05.160
whether they're happily transitioned,

01:47:05.160 --> 01:47:07.160
whether they're unhappily transitioned,

01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:08.160
whether they're detransitioned,

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:10.160
if you've got people who've dissociated

01:47:10.160 --> 01:47:12.160
from their sex in some way,

01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:13.160
every one of those people

01:47:13.160 --> 01:47:15.160
is someone who needs special accommodation.

01:47:15.160 --> 01:47:17.160
In a sane world where we

01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:19.160
re-acknowledge the truth of sex.

01:47:19.160 --> 01:47:21.160
So to wrap this up,

01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.160
is the backlash against JK Rowling

01:47:23.160 --> 01:47:25.160
a witch hunt?

01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:27.160
Unequivocally, no.

01:47:27.160 --> 01:47:29.160
It's very thoroughly deserved.

01:47:29.160 --> 01:47:31.160
But I will say this.

01:47:31.160 --> 01:47:33.160
A movement can't get along without a devil.

01:47:33.160 --> 01:47:36.160
And across the whole political spectrum,

01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:38.160
there's a misogynistic tendency

01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.160
to choose a female devil.

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.160
Whether it's Anita Bryant,

01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.160
Hillary Clinton,

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:44.160
Marie Antoinette,

01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:47.160
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,

01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:49.160
or JK Rowling.

01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.160
And there's always going to be people

01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:52.160
who seize on any opportunity

01:47:52.160 --> 01:47:54.160
to be misogynistic.

01:47:54.160 --> 01:47:56.160
So, I would advise trans people

01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:58.160
and our allies to keep in mind

01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.160
that JK Rowling is not the final boss

01:48:01.160 --> 01:48:03.160
of transphobia.

01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.160
She's not our devil.

01:48:05.160 --> 01:48:07.160
The devil is the Republican Party,

01:48:07.160 --> 01:48:08.160
the conservative party.

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:10.160
The devil is patriarchy.

01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:12.160
It's the right-wing men

01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.160
who will be the ones

01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:15.160
to put gender-critical theory

01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.160
into brutal practice.

01:48:17.160 --> 01:48:18.160
Anita Bryant,

01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:19.160
Posey Parker,

01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:21.160
and JK Rowling are,

01:48:21.160 --> 01:48:23.160
to borrow a term from TERFs,

01:48:23.160 --> 01:48:24.160
handmaidens.

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:26.160
TERFs are the real handmaidens.

01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:27.160
They're useful idiots

01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:29.160
who put a concerned female face

01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:31.160
on the patriarchal violence

01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:32.160
against trans people

01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:34.160
that will ultimately be enacted

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.160
by right-wing men.

01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:37.160
I call on men

01:48:37.160 --> 01:48:38.160
to consider themselves

01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:40.160
decent human beings.

01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:42.160
To call out the deviance among them

01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:44.160
and eradicate these monsters

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:46.160
from society.

01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:48.160
And Megan Phillips Roper

01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.160
and centrists like her

01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:52.160
are wrong that civil conversation

01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.160
can resolve this.

01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:56.160
To call out the deviance among them

01:48:56.160 --> 01:48:58.160
and eradicate these monsters

01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:00.160
from society.

01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:02.160
People like Michael Knowles

01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.160
and Ron DeSantis

01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.160
and Donald Trump

01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:06.160
cannot be persuaded.

01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:08.160
They have to be defeated.

01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:10.160
As for what to do about JK Rowling,

01:49:10.160 --> 01:49:11.160
honestly,

01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:13.160
let's all just block her.

01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:15.160
Open up Twitter right now,

01:49:15.160 --> 01:49:16.160
go to her profile

01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:17.160
and just block her.

01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:18.160
Problem solved.

01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:20.160
Like, don't harass her,

01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:21.160
that doesn't help.

01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.160
But also,

01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.160
I wouldn't wait for her to change.

01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:25.160
She's gone down what I call

01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:26.160
the bigotry whirlpool.

01:49:26.160 --> 01:49:27.160
The deeper you go in,

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:29.160
the harder it is to leave.

01:49:29.160 --> 01:49:30.160
For the same reasons

01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:32.160
that it's hard to quit a cult or scam.

01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:34.160
To quote video essayist Dan Olson,

01:49:34.160 --> 01:49:36.160
One of the most insidious elements

01:49:36.160 --> 01:49:37.160
of a confidence scam

01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:38.160
is that the victims

01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.160
who invested the most

01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:42.160
are often the most passionate defenders.

01:49:42.160 --> 01:49:43.160
Because shame

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:44.160
is a powerful force

01:49:44.160 --> 01:49:45.160
in the human psyche

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.160
and they can't bear the shame

01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:49.160
of admitting they were tricked.

01:49:49.160 --> 01:49:50.160
Reformed bigots have to face

01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:51.160
not only the shame

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.160
of being dupes,

01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:53.160
but also the guilt

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:55.160
of having devoted years of life

01:49:55.160 --> 01:49:57.160
to harming vulnerable people.

01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.160
This is something Megan,

01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.160
to her credit,

01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.160
faced head on.

01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.160
If we were wrong,

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.160
then I had spent

01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:03.160
every day of my life

01:50:03.160 --> 01:50:05.160
industriously sowing doom,

01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:06.160
discord,

01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:07.160
and rage

01:50:07.160 --> 01:50:08.160
to so many

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:09.160
not at the behest of God,

01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.160
but of others.

01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160
Not at the behest

01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:12.160
of my grandfather.

01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:13.160
I had wasted my life

01:50:13.160 --> 01:50:14.160
only to fill others

01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.160
with pain and misery.

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.160
Most bigots cannot stand

01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:19.160
to face this moral sunk cost.

01:50:19.160 --> 01:50:21.160
It's why an obsessive bigot

01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:22.160
like Graham Linehan,

01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:23.160
whose all-consuming hatred

01:50:23.160 --> 01:50:24.160
of trans people

01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.160
has ruined his life,

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.160
cost him his marriage,

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:28.160
and left him alone

01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:29.160
to tweet about destroying

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:30.160
gender ideology

01:50:30.160 --> 01:50:31.160
minutes before midnight

01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:32.160
on New Year's Eve,

01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:34.160
feels psychologically compelled

01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.160
to insist with ever more certainty

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.160
that trans people

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:38.160
are not just delusional

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:39.160
or dangerous,

01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:40.160
but are all

01:50:40.160 --> 01:50:42.160
demonic perverts,

01:50:42.160 --> 01:50:44.160
an enemy so hyperbolically evil

01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:45.160
that they justify

01:50:45.160 --> 01:50:47.160
his self-immolating crusade.

01:50:47.160 --> 01:50:50.160
They took everything from me,

01:50:50.160 --> 01:50:51.160
you know.

01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:54.160
They took my family,

01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:55.160
you know.

01:50:55.160 --> 01:50:56.160
And I just said,

01:50:56.160 --> 01:50:57.160
no, hang on a sec.

01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:59.160
Stop calling these women TERFs.

01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:02.160
Stop sending them abuse.

01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:03.160
Let them speak.

01:51:03.160 --> 01:51:05.160
And for that,

01:51:05.160 --> 01:51:07.160
they just destroyed me.

01:51:07.160 --> 01:51:08.160
Do you honestly feel destroyed?

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:10.160
No, because,

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:11.160
because the one thing about this,

01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:12.160
the one thing about this

01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:13.160
that keeps me going

01:51:13.160 --> 01:51:15.160
is that I know I'm right,

01:51:15.160 --> 01:51:16.160
you know.

01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:17.160
I know I'm right.

01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.160
As long as he stays here,

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.160
in the bottom of the whirlpool,

01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:21.160
he never has to face

01:51:21.160 --> 01:51:23.160
that he's ruined his relationships

01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:24.160
and wasted years of life

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:27.160
because he just couldn't let it go.

01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:28.160
And if JK Rowling

01:51:28.160 --> 01:51:29.160
doesn't log off soon,

01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:32.160
this will likely be her fate as well.

01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:35.160
I guess what I'm really trying to say is,

01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:37.160
Harry Potter's dead to me.

01:51:37.160 --> 01:51:39.160
I'm switching to Twilight.

01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:09.160
And there's authors

01:52:09.160 --> 01:52:10.160
that are bound to say

01:52:10.160 --> 01:52:11.160
that wizardry is a good thing

01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:13.160
but neither is warned.

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.160
And they say,

01:52:14.160 --> 01:52:15.160
well,

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.160
you and I

01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:16.760
can

01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:17.160
think about

01:52:17.160 --> 01:52:18.160
some other story

01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:19.160
you can put a bit

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:20.160
more perspective.

01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:21.540
Anything willка

01:52:23.160 --> 01:52:24.160
please let these characters

01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.160
have their own story.

01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:26.160
Because it all depends

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.160
on Jesus.

01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:27.720
Especially what one

01:52:27.720 --> 01:52:28.160
of the characters

01:52:28.160 --> 01:52:29.160
would ever say when

01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:30.160
they first come here.

01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:31.160
said that she was

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:32.160
on the line

01:52:32.160 --> 01:52:33.160
and byr.

01:52:33.160 --> 01:52:34.160
His daughter.

01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:35.160
spelled out

01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:36.160
it's one of the reasons

01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:37.160
Jim Crow doesn't roll over,

01:52:37.160 --> 01:53:07.140
Thank you.

01:53:07.160 --> 01:53:37.140
Thank you.

01:53:37.160 --> 01:54:07.140
Thank you.

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:37.140
Thank you.

01:54:37.160 --> 01:55:03.180
At least it's a fruit pie.
