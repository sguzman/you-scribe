0	8080	Sar, I'm going to talk about Joro once again, but first, story time.
9440	11440	Chapter 1. Anita
12800	19840	The most famous spigot in American LGBT history is a woman called Anita Bryant. This is her story.
22000	29840	1977 was not a good time to be gay. Is it ever really a good time to be gay?
30000	35040	In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights into national consciousness.
35040	39760	The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970, and in 1973 the American
39760	43920	Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.
43920	47360	But only after gay activists disrupted their conference and shouted,
47360	54560	Gay conversion therapy is torture! We have abnormal urges and we will not be silenced!
56160	58400	Because that's the only way to get anything done in this country,
58400	60000	you have to be super annoying about it.
60000	61520	They give you no choice.
61520	68560	On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida, known for such popular cities as Miami,
68560	70480	approved a law that added the phrase,
70480	74880	Affectional or Sexual Preference to its non-discrimination ordinance,
74880	79840	effectively banning housing and employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
79840	83840	And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,
83840	86480	that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.
86480	89680	Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!
90000	94080	Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman who once had a career as a pop singer,
94080	97280	beauty queen, and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.
97280	101120	Come to the Florida sunshine tree.
101120	105040	My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida any time of day.
105040	108800	Orange juice from Florida! It isn't just for breakfast anymore!
108800	115680	Orange juice with natural vitamin C from the Florida sunshine tree.
115680	118320	She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,
118320	119840	A day without orange juice.
120000	121920	is like a day without sunshine.
121920	125520	Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.
125520	126160	Cute.
126160	130000	When Anita heard her pastor speak about this non-discrimination ordinance,
130000	133520	she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.
133520	134400	How touching.
134400	139920	According to the word of God, it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.
139920	142880	As a mother, she would not stand for this.
142880	146000	So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner saying,
146000	148160	As a concerned mother of four children,
148160	150000	I am most definitely against this.
150000	151200	Ordinance Amendment.
151200	155120	I have never condoned nor taught my children discrimination against anyone.
155120	158240	But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,
158240	161680	you will in fact be infringing upon my rights
161680	164640	and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother
164640	168480	to teach my children God's moral code as stated in the holy scriptures.
168480	170720	Anita, kill your shitty child.
170720	174720	When the amendment passed, Anita created a campaign for its repeal.
174720	179680	The Save Our Children Coalition, which sponsored provocative TV ads,
179680	184720	implying that gay people are degenerates who ruin communities and seduce children.
184720	186400	The campaign has been vicious.
186400	191440	With television commercials, the Save Our Children group is appealing to parental anxieties,
191440	195600	saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality before impressionable children.
195600	200400	The Orange Bowl Parade, Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.
200400	203760	But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,
203760	208640	it's a parade of homosexuals, men hugging other men, cavorting with little boys.
208640	209520	Save Our Children.
209680	214080	Sparked the first organized backlash to gay rights in the United States,
214080	217040	escalating the conflict into a national controversy.
217040	219600	On one side were the gay rights activists,
219600	222720	who argued that non-discrimination was a matter of human rights.
222720	227040	On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued that the non-discrimination ordinance
227040	230320	would give special privileges to homosexuals.
230320	231920	We all believe in human rights,
231920	236400	but we don't believe in human rights that would corrupt our children
236400	238880	or for individuals to have special privileges.
238880	239440	We all believe in human rights, but we don't believe in human rights that would corrupt our children or for individuals to have special privileges.
239440	242960	That would go against the constitutional rights of normal America.
242960	245120	As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,
245120	246960	they have equal rights the same as anyone else.
246960	249760	In other words, gay people already have equal rights,
249760	253680	just as long as they stay in the closet and don't do anything gay.
253680	256000	That's very helpful.
256000	263760	Thank you so much, Anita, for standing up for our right to be gay in secret.
263760	268640	As long as they do their job and do not want to come out of the closet and force their homosexuality
268640	272160	on me in the areas of business or in the schools,
272160	276240	they can live their life and we're not going out after their jobs
276240	278960	or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.
278960	284160	Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals to teach children
284160	286400	was tantamount to gay recruitment.
286400	289680	Just biologically that God made mothers so that we could reproduce.
289680	293040	Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,
293040	296720	but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.
296720	298560	It's the exact same argument that's being used
298560	303040	today by right-wing politicians who claim that queer people are groomers.
303040	309120	Stop confusing our babies with your groomer gender ideologue.
309120	312640	This wicked book, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,
312640	316400	sexually indoctrinated with wicked, vile books.
316400	318960	And she believes in traditional marriage between a man and a woman,
318960	321040	and in that book it talked about two moms.
321040	324400	Stay away from the children creep or you will regret it.
324400	326400	People should definitely arm themselves, I agree with that.
326400	328400	The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.
328560	333040	The Democrats are the party of teachers, elementary school teachers,
333040	337120	trying to transition their elementary school-aged children
337120	339120	and convince them they're a different gender.
339120	341680	They're just evil people and they want to groom kids.
342480	343520	They're recruiting.
343520	346160	If you don't know what furries are, it's where school children
347120	351440	dress up as animals, cats or dogs, during the school day.
352320	353760	They meow and they bark.
353760	356080	What a great country we live in.
356080	358400	I love it so much.
358960	363120	Gay people around the country rallied against Anita Bryant and Save Our Children.
363120	366000	There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice,
366000	369040	with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu
369040	373920	and replacing them with an apple juice and vodka cocktail called an Anita Bryant.
373920	375040	Let's make one now.
375840	378400	Forgot my cocktail measure, so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.
379440	381280	Just a dash of apple juice.
381280	382240	Give it a stir.
385120	386000	Needs a garnish.
386000	386500	Stir.
386500	387000	Stir.
387000	387500	Stir.
387500	388000	Stir.
388000	388500	Stir.
388560	389120	Stunning.
389120	392560	I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver, but if I was in the 70s,
392560	396400	I would have thrown back so many of these goddamn things out of pure spite.
396400	401680	There's a story that Troy Perry, the founder of the gay-affirming metropolitan community church,
401680	406080	was on a transcontinental flight, and when the attendant put a glass of orange juice on his tray,
406080	406880	he said,
406880	408080	TAKE THAT AWAY.
408080	409520	I'M A HOMOSEXUAL.
409520	416640	At Gay Pride marches in 1977 and 78, anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently on t-shirts,
416640	417920	signs, and buttons.
417920	420160	Anita Bryant sucks oranges.
420160	423680	A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.
423680	424160	True.
424160	428320	And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired more anti-gay legislation,
428320	432880	including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage, both of which passed in the Florida
432880	437680	Senate, as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California, which would have forced public
437680	439680	schools to fire gay teachers.
439680	441920	So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.
441920	443760	She was an influential bigot.
443760	447760	But she may also have helped to unify and galvanize gay activists,
447920	450080	by providing them with a common enemy.
450080	452240	According to historian Lillian Faderman,
452240	456800	Anita Bryant created fervent activists out of those who'd previously been content
456800	459120	simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.
459120	464560	Faderman cites Eric Hoffer's observation that a mass movement can get along fine without a god,
464560	466880	but it won't get along at all without a devil.
466880	470960	For gay people all over the country, Anita Bryant became that devil.
470960	476000	I think that she is rallying the community together like I have never seen before.
476000	477600	There's no way I could have done it on my own.
477920	482800	So even though she succeeded in her initial goal to repeal the non-discrimination ordinance,
482800	487120	there is no question that in the long term, Anita Bryant was the loser.
487120	488720	She took a lot of L's.
488720	489280	RIP.
489280	490640	That must be super hard for her.
490640	495040	For the short remainder of her career, gay activists protested her events,
495040	499840	they shut down the tour for her book about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,
499840	503600	and they succeeded in turning public opinion against Anita Bryant
503600	507680	to the point that she became virtually unemployable in mainstream entertainment.
507920	511040	It helped that she came across as kind of a judgmental prude,
511040	515040	that even hip straight people didn't want to be associated with.
515040	520320	Our top story tonight, Anita Bryant, former mediocre actress and orange juice promoter,
520960	526960	performed coitus in public yesterday, campaigned to promote heterosexuality.
526960	529760	We don't serve orange juice anymore.
529760	531920	Like she famously told Playboy magazine,
531920	534240	Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?
534240	537120	It's because they eat the forbidden fruit of the tree of life.
537120	538960	God referred to men as trees.
538960	542880	And because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit, which is male sperm.
542880	544160	Oh my God.
544160	546640	Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.
546640	548160	This is how you lose the culture war.
548160	555600	So let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita, pass a little juice around.
555600	559360	And of course, there was the famous incident where a gay activist
559360	563280	smashed a banana cream pie in Anita's face during a TV appearance.
563280	566960	And went into a place called Norfolk, Virginia, and were met with protest,
567120	575600	and, uh, um, all kinds of problems and, uh, uh, every security agent, security.
575600	576560	No, no, let him stay.
576560	577280	No, let him stay.
578080	580000	Well, at least it's a fruit pie.
580000	584800	Miami-Dade County finally reinstated the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998,
584800	588160	and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.
588160	592560	In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face.
592560	596160	When her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,
597120	601200	she was the only one who had the courage to a woman in publicly struggling
601200	603920	with whether to even invite her grandmother to the ceremony.
603920	607920	It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks that, like,
607920	612800	an integral part of your identity is just, uh, an evil delusion.
612800	616640	That it is, Sarah. That it is.
616640	621040	So that's the story of Anita Bryant, as students of LGBT history know it.
621040	623440	But isn't it a bit one-sided?
623440	626080	Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?
626080	629040	Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.
629600	632160	Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.
632160	633600	A plague on both the houses.
633600	638960	Isn't it cruel, even, to slur Anita as a bigot and a homophobe?
638960	645040	In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant was the real victim?
647600	649200	Oh no. Oh no!
653120	654240	I can't do this anymore.
654240	654960	I'm eating my pie.
654960	655920	I'm eating my goddamn pie.
655920	656480	I'm eating my goddamn pie.
656480	657120	Chapter Two.
657680	659760	The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.
659760	660560	God help us all.
661680	666000	The mainstream media would have us believe that Anita Bryant is a so-called
666000	668800	homophobe, some kind of hateful bigot.
668800	673760	But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic used to silence valid concerns?
673760	679280	Mothers in this country are worried about their children going to school to be taught by perverts.
679280	684400	How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals weren't the real bigots?
684400	685440	Isn't it possible, though?
685440	689280	Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant was the first victim of cancel culture?
689280	692240	Of, dare I say it, wokeism?
692880	693760	Well, no.
693760	696560	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
696560	698240	But suppose that you're an idiot.
698240	700960	And suppose that that's the narrative you wanted to promote.
700960	702800	Well, what would be your argument?
702800	706320	I mean, if someone put a gun to my head and forced me to make that argument,
706320	708720	I'd probably say something like this.
708720	711600	Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.
711600	715280	In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty in rural Oklahoma.
715840	718480	Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,
718480	721680	the same year she made her singing debut at the Baptist Church.
722240	725520	Parts of my childhood, I blocked out because it hurts too much.
725520	729280	I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old, and my parents were remarried,
729280	732720	and I was baptized and came to know Christ as my personal savior.
732720	735920	Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.
735920	739280	It was real painful, and it just about killed my mother.
739280	741280	She was a very submissive wife.
741280	744080	She was too submissive, and it angered me.
744080	745280	She let my dad step up.
745280	747600	All over her because of him.
747600	750720	I think I went through life for a long time hating all men.
750720	756560	Anita described her most intense adolescent memory as a feeling of intense ambition,
756560	758720	a relentless drive to succeed at doing well.
758720	759440	The thing I loved.
769440	775120	But Anita's ambition conflicted with her submissive role as a traditional Christian woman.
775520	778320	In 1960, Anita married Bob Greene,
778320	782640	Miami's top disc jockey, but only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.
782640	785040	This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.
788880	792000	Greene was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.
792000	794080	Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,
794080	799040	Greene manipulated Bryant with a cruelty nearly unmatched in modern love stories.
799040	801760	And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,
801760	804800	Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.
804800	806960	But while submitting to her husband
806960	812080	and raising four children, Anita was still able to build the career she'd always wanted.
812080	817120	By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice, earning half a million dollars
817120	822800	a year, enough to move her family into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.
822800	826240	So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.
826240	832800	Did she really deserve to lose it all just because she took a stand for something she believed in?
832800	834720	Anita Bryant's role as a leader,
834720	839940	in the campaign against homosexuals may be hurting her campaign to sell orange juice are you being
839940	845640	blackballed well it's uh it's it looks that way it's it's worse than that we're being threatened
845640	850660	and uh there's all kinds of harassment even with my job with florida citrus i have been blacklisted
850660	857100	for exercising the right of a mother to defend her children and all children against their being
857100	862480	recruited by homosexuals her entire life had become a series of catastrophes she'd been dropped as
862480	866800	spokesperson by the orange growers she had been dropped as a commentator on the orange bowl parade
866800	870940	she lost a television show contract her bookings dropped drastically
870940	887000	no one has paid as dearly as nita bryant for taking a public stand on something she believed
887000	892460	in i remember lying in the bed in my my mother's house in a fetal position
892460	898200	and wanting to die gay activists in the 1970s didn't exactly limit their tactics to polite
898200	908880	debate in the free marketplace of ideas homosexuals started fighting back the gays formed new groups
908880	914400	and picketed the performers public appearances forcing her to cancel a few gay activists routinely
914400	920320	compared anita to adolf h they created pastiches of her orange juice slogan they blamed her for
920320	922280	hate crimes they burned her in
922460	928280	refugee they disrupted events she was involved in they printed toilet paper with her face on it
928280	934800	some sent anita death threats or they mailed her rotting oranges dead cockroaches human excrement
934800	939080	see this is how you cancelled people before phones instead of posting you would
939080	945120	simply mail actual human through the united states postal service neither snow nor rain nor
945120	950800	heat nor gloom of night anita's husband pleaded to supporters how would you men feel if you opened
950800	952440	a letter and there was a photo of her in the post office of the united states post office of the
952440	962600	united states you can imagine quite a lot i do think it would be fair to say that a lot of the
962600	968600	rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone lillian faderman recounts that lesbians particularly
968600	974360	lesbian feminists abhorred the sexist terms that were being used to characterize anita bryant
974360	980760	and gay men called her the harassment escalated to the point where anita had to cancel her book tour
980760	982280	due to demonstrations and bribes against anita bryant who had been a victim of sexual abuse in the United States.
982440	986280	bomb threats from gay activists and of course there was the pie
988360	992840	so much for the tolerant matashin society it's kind of a deep cut well something to entertain
992840	998200	the boomer queers gay activists claimed to stand for human rights but what about anita's right to
998200	1003880	free speech i wish i had some literal pearls to clutch civil libertarian nat hentoff wrote in his
1003880	1010280	1992 book free speech for me but not for thee that the orange shoes boycott reminded him of a little
1010280	1012280	thing called mccarthyism
1012680	1018840	have you ever considered that being pro-gay is quite similar to being anti-gay and that both
1018840	1025640	are opinions as anita tells it she and her foot soldiers of god were the victims of sinister gay
1025640	1030760	carpetbaggers the foot soldiers were housewives and mothers religious and civic leaders in
1030760	1036280	opposition to a well-organized highly financed and politically militant group of homosexual
1036280	1042360	activists we were cast as bigots haters discriminators and deniers of basic
1042360	1047480	human rights and all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned for our children and our
1047480	1053720	community so anita's version of the story is that she and a handful of well-intentioned christian
1053720	1060760	mothers were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia of gay extremists all because they had a
1060760	1067240	few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual cavorting with little boys cavorting
1067240	1071720	with little boys is it really fair to call this woman a bigot until the dade county or
1071720	1077080	the county ordinance anita was a registered democrat and considered herself a liberal
1077080	1082840	and she never said that she hated gay people or wanted them dead in fact she even said that she
1082840	1089160	loves homosexuals i love homosexuals if you can believe that i love them enough to tell them the
1089160	1093720	truth because i know that there is hope for the homosexuals that if they're willing to
1094840	1101240	turn from sin the same as any individual that that they can be ex-homosexuals the same as there can
1101240	1101640	be an extra homosexual question is she a bigot no she's not a bigot she's not a homosexual performally
1101640	1103900	an ex-murderer, an ex-thief, or ex-anybody.
1103900	1108340	She loves homosexuals because they can change,
1108340	1110160	just like murderers.
1110160	1113320	Would a bigot have said that?
1113320	1114900	Just about McFuckin' had it.
1114900	1116740	Anita was so kind-hearted,
1116740	1120240	she even said that she related to the homosexual.
1120240	1122040	I can relate to the homosexual
1122040	1124940	because I've had emotional scars in my own life.
1124940	1126920	I really felt the rejection of my father,
1126920	1128100	and that is one of the things
1128100	1131140	that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.
1131140	1134220	Look, I don't hate homosexuals, that's the truth,
1134220	1136140	no matter what they think of my motives.
1136140	1138660	I've always said I love the sinner, but I hate the sin.
1138660	1141300	Wow, what an empath.
1141300	1143180	You know, I actually think it's really noble
1143180	1146380	how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage
1146380	1147800	onto the marginalized group
1147800	1150540	whose rights she's trying to take away.
1150540	1153700	Okay, so we've given a fair hearing to both sides,
1153700	1156940	to many sides, we've considered all the evidence.
1156940	1160200	Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head
1160200	1161040	and ask,
1161140	1165320	did Anita Bryant really deserve that pie to the face?
1165320	1168160	Well, yes, obviously.
1168160	1169740	Look, the point I'm trying to make here
1169740	1172620	is that it's possible to take genuine virtues
1172620	1175660	like nuance, empathy, and impartiality,
1175660	1178800	and to twist them into fucked-up apologia
1178800	1180940	for horrible, oppressive behavior.
1180940	1182640	If you play this game long enough,
1182640	1184380	you can essentially explain away
1184380	1186380	the entire concept of bigotry
1186380	1189760	and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.
1191140	1193320	This is the true nature of all of us,
1193320	1195360	all of us who are human beings.
1195360	1197840	We're all human beings who have been
1197840	1200480	understood as people with difficult childhoods
1200480	1203940	and valid concerns cruelly demonized
1203940	1207500	by militant activists defaming and silencing them
1207500	1211720	with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.
1211720	1216080	Now, because you viewers are smart, media-literate people,
1216080	1219040	you understand framing, so you already know
1219040	1220980	that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant
1220980	1227480	J.K. Rowling is a popular author who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,
1227480	1232640	but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers masturbating into stolen panties
1232640	1235140	because she's lost her goddamn mind.
1235140	1237340	Lo ho ho, dear readers.
1237340	1240140	Christ, what a nightmare.
1240140	1241860	Chapter 3.
1241860	1244460	The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.
1244460	1247880	Alright kids, it's trans in time.
1247880	1253440	Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps
1253440	1259720	Roper, an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church, the notorious hate group from Topeka,
1259720	1265840	Kansas most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers with signs that say God hates
1265840	1267200	f**ks.
1267200	1269960	God and me both, I'm tired of you people.
1269960	1270960	J.K.
1270960	1271960	Illy!
1271960	1276440	The Westboro Baptist Church is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups in the
1276440	1277440	world.
1277440	1280980	I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.
1280980	1286800	I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries, I went to a counter-protest in 2010, I remember
1286800	1291340	how when I was in high school, the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing that
1291340	1297680	conservatives and liberals could agree on because they hated the troops and the gays.
1297680	1300680	Essentially the two genders of 2006.
1300680	1303840	But let's not pretend that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.
1303840	1307000	Okay, when Megan was at Westboro, she used to do these amazing ladies.
1307000	1311160	She used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies about how the gays are going to hell, which
1311160	1314400	to this day I am a big fan of.
1314400	1318120	But what did you say you think God loves your brain?
1318120	1321400	He hates all you do cause you love fornicating.
1321400	1322400	Fornicating.
1322400	1323400	Fornicating.
1323400	1324400	It's perfect.
1324400	1325400	I love it.
1325400	1326400	Play it at my funeral.
1326400	1327400	Stop praying, stop praying.
1327400	1328400	God will not hear you anymore.
1328400	1329400	You taught the boys and the girls to be proud.
1329400	1330400	For, for, forever burn.
1330400	1331400	Go devil's finder.
1331400	1332400	God will not hear you anymore.
1332400	1333400	You taught the boys and the girls to be proud.
1333400	1334400	For, for, forever burn.
1334400	1335400	Go devil's finder.
1335400	1336360	For, for, forever burn.
1336360	1337360	Go devil's finder.
1337360	1340260	You just keep pushing on to the hell where you will forever burn.
1340260	1346420	Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012 after a crisis of faith precipitated
1346420	1349200	by a power struggle within the church.
1349200	1354400	She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow, which is honestly a pretty interesting account
1354400	1359740	of deconversion and the circumstances that lead someone to leaving a hate group.
1359740	1365220	Megan contacted me for her podcast because I had criticized TjK Rowling in a video a
1365220	1366220	couple years ago.
1366220	1370500	Now, you might be wondering, why would I think that a person who's been carrying a
1370500	1375580	God Hates F**ks sign most of her life would be the correct person to lead an international
1375580	1379220	conversation about the intricacies of LGBT issues?
1379220	1381120	Because I'm an idiot.
1381120	1382120	Happy?
1382120	1386860	Basically, I agreed to the podcast because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.
1386860	1393220	A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church wants to mediate a conversation between me
1393220	1395220	and the author of Harry Potter.
1395220	1397220	Would you say no to that?
1397220	1399220	Maybe.
1399220	1400620	If you're smart.
1400620	1406240	Last month, the podcast was announced in an essay by Megan titled The Witch Trials of
1406240	1407240	J.K.
1407240	1408240	Rowling.
1408240	1413460	Obviously a tendentious framing that posits Joro as the target of an irrational trans
1413460	1414460	witch hunt.
1414460	1421100	The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,
1421100	1423540	as well as a photo of an angry trans mob holding a rotten hell roll.
1423540	1424540	I'm not sure if that's true.
1424540	1429080	The quote was a rotten hell Rowling sign, juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians
1429080	1432740	burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.
1432740	1434980	This did not bode well.
1434980	1440340	So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy to
1440340	1442560	some kind of unearned J.K.
1442560	1444540	Rowling redemption tour.
1444540	1450560	This caused Megan's mom, Shirley, to quote tweet me, calling me a bigot against God.
1450560	1453560	I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.
1453560	1458180	There's only one of him, and he could really use your help, Shirley.
1458180	1464660	I said in these tweets that I felt used, which that is how I felt, but ultimately I need
1464660	1468020	to take full responsibility for my involvement in this.
1468020	1472700	The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this is you honestly have no idea what
1472700	1477960	the final product is going to be like, so the decision to participate is always a leap
1477960	1478960	of faith.
1478960	1481560	And I can't really say that Megan misled me.
1481560	1482560	There are red flags from the video.
1482560	1483560	I don't know.
1483560	1487160	They were there from the beginning, and I ignored them because I was projecting my
1487160	1489540	own hopes onto the situation.
1489540	1491760	You know, it's a compelling story.
1491760	1498460	I liked the idea that this famous former bigot could talk some sense into a famous current
1498460	1499460	bigot.
1499460	1505780	We all love a good redemption arc, and I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.
1505780	1509700	That's something I've moved away from, but there's still part of me that wants to see
1509700	1511180	the best in people.
1511180	1513140	And to believe that people can change.
1513140	1519040	If you just talk to them, and make a good enough argument.
1519040	1525880	Maybe my wishful thinking was that because Megan left Westboro, that must mean that she
1525880	1531960	must understand the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?
1531960	1538680	And despite no evidence for this, my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally,
1538680	1541040	and could be really effective at confronting Joe Roe about all the trans stuff.
1541040	1542040	I don't know.
1542040	1557500	I'm Megan Phelps-Roper, and these are the Witch Trials of JK Rowling.
1557500	1563640	The Witch Trials of JK Rowling is more than seven hours of apologetics for JKR.
1563640	1570920	The podcast presents Rowling as a complex, humane, heroic figure with an inspiring feminist
1570920	1571920	backstory.
1572040	1576540	Joe Rowling's rise to success is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.
1576540	1587540	Now cruelly besieged by a vicious mob of transgender activists, all because she, as a woman, had
1587540	1592980	a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.
1592980	1600040	I had been becoming increasingly concerned about the way in which women were being shut
1600040	1601040	down.
1601040	1604360	And I felt had some very valid concerns.
1604360	1610940	Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing of the conflict as feminists versus trans
1610940	1618540	rights activists, whom Rowling describes as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.
1618540	1625640	For the first five hours of this podcast, Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational
1625640	1627040	mob of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.
1627040	1628040	And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.
1628040	1629040	And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.
1629040	1630040	And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.
1630040	1631040	And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.
1631040	1632040	And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.
1632040	1633040	And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.
1633040	1634040	And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.
1634040	1635040	You are murdering trans children!
1635040	1636040	Trans get up all time!
1636040	1640120	A huge amount of I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.
1640120	1642280	And you did it at my birthday dinner!
1642280	1648260	There's this one clip of some kind of antifa supersoldiers abrasive screaming that they
1648260	1649920	play like once per episode.
1649920	1650920	Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit.
1650920	1654920	You look like you got your teeth knocked out of your fuckin' flashes.
1654920	1655480	Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares and you will die alive.
1655480	1657100	I want to fight together.
1657100	1658100	I support my family.
1658100	1659440	I want to be a battle partner.
1659440	1659560	I want to be a battle partner.
1659560	1660000	I want to be a battle partner.
1660040	1666780	And then it usually cuts to, like, somber monks chanting some kind of medieval lament.
1666780	1669740	You will die alone and you will burn in hell!
1675160	1680200	Just in case you didn't get from the title that this is a witch hunt.
1686380	1687820	Do you guys get it?
1688160	1689120	Do you get it yet?
1690040	1692400	Yeah, your teeth knocked out, you fucking fascist!
1692540	1694160	Let's get up on time!
1694160	1701260	And then these mobs of irrational, misogynistic, trans rights fanatics are contrasted with
1701260	1708740	this poignant story of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband to publish our generation's
1708740	1710300	most beloved novels.
1710700	1715460	I was still very committed to those parts that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,
1715760	1719480	because there was a truth to them and there was a power to them.
1719480	1719940	The
1719940	1727540	only voices of genuine trans dissent appear in episode six out of seven, more than five
1727540	1728540	hours in.
1728540	1730160	And there's only two of us.
1730160	1737780	One is me, shame, and the other is a teenager named Noah, who kind of just seems like he
1737780	1744620	wants to be liked and understood, and wishes that his favorite author would please stop
1744620	1746600	saying bigoted things about him.
1746600	1749560	I'm such a big Harry Potter fan where I was such a big Harry Potter fan.
1749940	1753600	especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.
1754280	1756380	I can't even state how important it was to me.
1756920	1761700	J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography from my third grade classroom
1761700	1764740	and I kept it for a long time because I just loved reading it
1764740	1766140	because I just admired her so much.
1766140	1769000	It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.
1769320	1772180	On my last day editing this video, I got in touch with Noah.
1772620	1776240	I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast he wanted me to pass along
1776240	1777620	and this is what he said.
1777620	1780860	I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue are very different
1780860	1782380	from any sort of rhetorical debate.
1782940	1785080	Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,
1785240	1787500	but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,
1787980	1790880	the outcome of this conversation dictates their health, well-being,
1791000	1792060	and ability to survive.
1792300	1795280	How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling should come second
1795280	1798180	to fighting for maintained access to health care, support,
1798320	1801600	and general resources for children and adolescents seeking gender care.
1801880	1802720	I agree.
1803140	1804840	The most frustrating thing about this podcast
1804840	1807600	is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.
1807620	1812760	They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling is the victim of a witch hunt
1812760	1815580	in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.
1815940	1818720	These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.
1820280	1822220	I mean, TERF is basically witch.
1822860	1826140	But if you point this out, they just deny it.
1826340	1828280	Show me the actual words, Jack.
1828460	1832280	Show me where I said I'm the victim of a witch hunt by trans people.
1832600	1835460	You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.
1835700	1837580	Yes, a podcast on which,
1837780	1841600	I never once say I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.
1841900	1842660	What are you talking about?
1842680	1844360	I'm not scamming the government, if that's what you're saying.
1844480	1846120	Your license plate says scamming.
1846560	1848400	Uh, no.
1849100	1849980	What do you mean, no?
1851120	1851560	Yes.
1852480	1852960	Joanne.
1853520	1857880	Show me where I ever said that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.
1858380	1860460	Why would you even think that?
1860700	1862380	You're crazy.
1862380	1867380	By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt for sale now.
1867620	1869620	At Wild Womine Workshop.
1869620	1871620	And Megan is not much better.
1871620	1876620	Like, there's this whole section in episode two where Megan interviews Christians who
1876620	1882620	burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s, and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.
1882620	1888120	So, looking back, would you say that the Christian parents were maybe part of a moral panic?
1888120	1889120	Yeah, absolutely.
1889120	1891120	It's a scary world out there.
1891120	1896260	Megan doesn't explicitly say she thinks trans protests against Joe Rowe are equivalent to
1896260	1896900	the Christian ones in the 90s.
1896900	1900900	But she does heavily imply it.
1900900	1906540	There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets, which led many, including lifelong
1906540	1913780	fans of her work, to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned, boycotted, and
1913780	1916360	in some cases, burned.
1916360	1921900	When confronted about the obvious implications of the podcast's title, Megan said,
1921900	1922900	The title is ambiguous.
1922900	1924900	Toward the end of our conversations, I spent a long time talking with Megan.
1924900	1925900	She said,
1925900	1930300	I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling about discernment, about how a person can
1930300	1934900	ever know if they're standing up for what's right, or joining a moral panic.
1934900	1938900	I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.
1938900	1941900	Megan, I was not surprised.
1941900	1944900	I know I won't ever regret having stood up on this issue.
1944900	1945900	Ever.
1945900	1950100	The podcast released new episodes weekly, and whenever Megan was challenged about the
1950100	1952900	blatant one-sidedness, Megan would respond,
1952900	1953900	Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?
1953900	1954900	Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?
1954900	1957660	Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?
1957660	1958660	Maybe you should preserve judgment.
1958660	1959820	Maybe you should preserve judgment.
1959820	1960820	Maybe you should preserve judgment.

1969820	1970820	Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now, and I truly do not think that anyone with
1970820	1971820	Google thôi basis media comprehension skills could come away from this thinking that the
1971820	1972820	main intent was anything other than to portray J.K. Rowling as him.
1972820	1978240	And I truly do not think that anyone with basic media comprehension skills
1978240	1982780	could come away from this thinking that the main intent was anything other
1982780	1991020	than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr of an unjust, uh, what's the word?
1992140	1992840	Witch hunt?
1993060	1998360	This is the obvious implication of the podcast from the first words to the very last.
1998660	2002080	And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.
2002080	2004960	The final episode concludes with this.
2005320	2008220	There are more important things in this world than being popular.
2009380	2011820	And that doesn't mean it's more important to me to be right.
2013000	2015500	It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.
2015940	2017820	Why would you end on that note?
2018440	2021840	Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is
2021840	2027040	if Megan didn't fundamentally believe that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?
2027600	2029540	I don't regret it because I did the right thing.
2029540	2032000	Like there really is no other reasonable way
2032000	2033200	to interpret this.
2033380	2035720	So I wish that she would just be honest.
2036120	2040560	If you believe that J.K. Rowling is the misunderstood victim of a witch hunt,
2041060	2042520	then just say that.
2042880	2045020	Make the argument you want to make.
2045240	2048640	Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,
2048920	2052620	this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.
2053060	2056520	Don't rely on innuendo and framing and
2056520	2061220	lachrymose Gregorian chanting to make your point.
2061220	2061700	Well,
2062000	2066880	don't go around coyly denying you have any kind of agenda beyond.
2067240	2069940	I just believe in conversation.
2069960	2070720	I don't know.
2071000	2074540	I just find this a slippery and dishonest way to argue.
2074640	2078680	But if you happen to be a fan of slippery and dishonest arguments,
2078780	2083880	you're in luck because there is more where that came from.

2122340	2125520	Chapter four, Joe Rowe's transphobia.
2126520	2127120	That's it.
2129840	2131500	I'm going full Slytherin.
2131720	2137120	In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling, Joe Rowe compares trans activists
2137120	2140900	to Death Eaters, the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.
2141220	2148620	My position is that this activist movement, in the form that it's currently taking, echoes
2148620	2149700	the very thing that I was doing.
2149720	2151200	I was warning against in Harry Potter.
2151620	2156340	The Death Eaters claimed we have been made to live in secret, and now is our time.
2156720	2162720	I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.
2162960	2167880	When an article then claimed she had equated trans people to Death Eaters, the podcast's
2167880	2170700	PR firm reached out, demanding a correction.
2171020	2176620	Because she only equated the movement to Death Eaters, not trans people in general.
2177040	2178760	Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people.
2178760	2179520	I just hate it.
2179520	2181420	I hate it when they advocate for themselves.
2181420	2186260	So I do have to be very careful with my wording here, lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.
2186260	2190980	J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with, because she expresses it as an endless
2190980	2194760	series of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.
2194760	2199760	A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle consisting of a Mott, that
2199760	2205880	is, a tower atop a mound or hill, easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard that's
2205880	2209160	much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.
2209520	2213540	The Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes a provocative claim that's difficult
2213540	2214840	to defend.
2214840	2215900	The Bailey.
2215900	2221020	And then, when confronted with counter-arguments, they walk it back to a much less controversial
2221020	2223700	and easy-to-defend version of the claim.
2223700	2224920	The Mott.
2224920	2230700	For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim like, sex is real.
2230700	2232360	What does she mean by that?
2232360	2233360	What are the implications?
2233360	2239360	Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks it's very sinister that in the Associated
2239360	2245500	Press style guide, it says that instead of referring to a trans woman as a man who identifies
2245500	2249680	as a woman, journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.
2249680	2253500	That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.
2253500	2258960	They've edged from identifies as a woman, so a man identifies as a woman, which, and
2258960	2262280	I think we all understand what that means, into is a woman.
2262280	2266660	And that's precisely the creep that I'm talking about.
2266660	2268680	We are using language to...
2268680	2274540	To make accurate definition of sex difference unspeakable.
2274540	2280480	Which is of course false, because the words trans and cis exist precisely to make it easy
2280480	2282500	to talk about sex difference.
2282500	2283500	Thanks a lot, Tumblr.
2283500	2288180	God, there's this whole section of the podcast that sort of implies that transgender people
2288180	2293580	were invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even gonna get into because we don't have time.
2293580	2297500	Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks that all people who menstruate must be referred
2297500	2298660	to as women.
2298680	2299680	Or was it wombin?
2299680	2301480	I'm pretty sure it was wompmud.
2301480	2307720	So trans men and transmasculine people, they're all women and must be referred to as women.
2307720	2309920	Because J.K. Rowling demands it.
2309920	2311960	This is controversial, right?
2311960	2315060	Calling trans women men who identify as women.
2315060	2316660	Calling trans men women.
2316660	2319920	This is the Bailey in her Mott and Bailey argument.
2319920	2321180	Trans women are men.
2321180	2322180	Trans men are women.
2322180	2325540	That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.
2325540	2328540	Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash...
2328680	2331640	Rowling walks the argument back and says,
2331640	2336660	I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being
2336660	2339220	female has shaped our lives.
2339220	2343640	Women should be allowed to discuss how being female has shaped our lives.
2343640	2349000	This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial interpretation of sex is real.
2349000	2350000	The Mott.
2350000	2354980	And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes make about trans people follows
2354980	2355980	this pattern.
2355980	2356680	J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstadter, said,
2356680	2357680	I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being
2357680	2358680	female has shaped our lives.
2358680	2359680	I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being
2359680	2360680	female has shaped our lives.
2360680	2361680	J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstadter, will tweet inflammatory things like,
2361680	2362680	Men cannot change into women.
2362680	2367680	But then when she's criticised, she'll say that she's being attacked for gender-critical
2367680	2368680	belief.
2368680	2375160	Gender-critical belief, which is absolutely ordinary belief about sex that your mother
2375160	2377080	and your grandmother are women.
2377080	2379080	That being female is a thing.
2379080	2381920	Your mother and grandmother are women.
2381920	2383580	Being female is a thing.
2383580	2385640	That's literally all I'm saying.
2385640	2387640	But if that's literally all she was saying...
2387680	2390860	then no one would be mad, would they?
2390860	2392600	Nine, gnar.
2392600	2395900	Men cannot change into women, is the Bailey.
2395900	2398540	Your mom is a woman, is the Mott.
2398540	2399800	Your mom's a woman.
2401200	2403900	This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.
2403900	2406780	They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,
2406780	2408700	exhibitionists, and voyeurs.
2408700	2411580	Then when trans people understandably get mad,
2411580	2413780	they'll say, look, I'm being attacked
2413780	2417160	just for saying that being female is part of my experience.
2417160	2418180	It's dishonest.
2418180	2420260	They talk a bunch of trash about trans people,
2420260	2422300	and then when trans people talk trash back,
2422300	2423940	they pretend that they're being victimized
2423940	2426080	for making totally innocuous statements.
2426080	2429760	We could name this behavior the birthday boy argument.
2429760	2431680	I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt
2431680	2433840	every jacked 6'3 bro he met
2433840	2436420	until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up,
2436420	2439620	whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on.
2439620	2440740	I'm a little guy.
2440740	2441920	I'm just a little guy.
2441920	2444520	No, it's also my birthday.
2444520	2446360	I'm a little birthday boy.
2446360	2447120	And somehow, it always happens.
2447120	2447960	It always worked.
2447960	2449500	So a birthday boy argument
2449500	2452440	is when you make aggressive, inflammatory assertions,
2452440	2456220	followed by, teacher, teacher, look what he's doing to me,
2456220	2457220	when the target reacts
2457220	2459460	with anything less than extreme politeness.
2459460	2460900	Another common tactic you'll see
2460900	2463440	any time Rowling's transphobia is discussed
2463440	2465260	is you'll see someone jump in to say,
2465260	2468520	show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.
2468520	2470660	For example, here's someone on Twitter
2470660	2472960	called Large Gamete Producer.
2472960	2476020	It's funny, isn't it, how these people will insist
2476020	2479940	that awkward, inclusive language like people who menstruate
2479940	2482140	is horribly oppressive and degrading,
2482140	2484020	but then they'll just straight up call themselves
2484020	2486620	Large Gamete Producer,
2486620	2489540	which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.
2489540	2493540	The woman is the producer of the large gametes.
2493540	2494380	Oh, I like it.
2494380	2495720	It's very broodmother.
2495720	2497580	That Rowling's words regularly appear
2497580	2500660	in gender-critical arguments shows the massive influence
2500660	2502900	that she has in the anti-trans movement.
2502900	2505860	She's like their queen, their leader, their headmistress.
2505860	2508100	She's the best thing that ever happened to them.
2508100	2510340	Because Sheila Jeffries certainly wasn't persuading
2510340	2511180	a lot of people.
2511180	2512240	If you know, you know.
2512240	2514400	Large Gamete Producer says,
2514400	2516460	GK isn't anti-trans.
2516460	2520020	Give me just one direct quote that she has said
2520020	2521440	which is anti-trans.
2521440	2522740	Oh, what's that?
2522740	2524280	You can't find one?
2524280	2526500	Well, color me shocked.
2526500	2527340	Imagine.
2527340	2529680	Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,
2529680	2533200	let's take a look at Large Gamete Producer's profile.
2533200	2535740	Trans women are not women, they are men.
2535860	2538520	Trans men are not men, they are women.
2538520	2539900	Nothing can change that.
2539900	2542300	Sex is binary.
2542300	2545420	Like if this person doesn't think that trans women are men,
2545420	2548780	trans men are women is a transphobic statement,
2548780	2551440	then what would they consider a transphobic statement?
2551440	2553660	This is why the first question you should always ask
2553660	2556780	such people is, do you believe that transphobia
2556780	2558500	is a legitimate concept?
2558500	2560180	What are some examples of statements
2560180	2562240	that you would consider transphobic?
2562240	2564740	Because many of them don't believe that transphobia
2564740	2565700	is a valid concept.
2565700	2567760	Because they don't think that trans people
2567760	2569380	are a legitimate minority.
2569380	2570880	There's no such thing as a trans woman.
2570880	2573040	There's no such thing as a trans person.
2573040	2574000	There is no such thing.
2574000	2576900	There are people that call themselves these things
2576900	2580180	that may have other issues manifesting
2580180	2582260	that then make them think they're this, but no.
2582260	2584940	We have to stop using any words like transgender.
2584940	2586700	There may be more words that we have to say
2586700	2587640	in order to say that.
2587640	2589960	We may call it transgender ideology,
2589960	2591500	but when it comes to a person,
2591500	2593980	they may be following transgender ideology,
2593980	2595500	but they are not transgender.
2595500	2598100	There is no such thing as a man or a woman
2598100	2600300	being anything other than a man or a woman.
2600300	2602640	So when they say, show me an example
2602640	2605340	of something transphobic JK Rowling has said,
2605340	2606600	this is a trap.
2606600	2607820	They're just messing with you.
2607820	2609880	There's nothing that she could have said
2609880	2611940	that they would acknowledge as transphobic.
2611940	2614020	Now, if you're someone who believes that transphobia
2614020	2615260	is a valid concept,
2615260	2618300	and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,
2618300	2620260	but you just genuinely are unaware
2620260	2622580	of what JK Rowling has said on the topic,
2622580	2625360	then I will refer you to my past video on JK Rowling,
2625360	2628580	rather than recapping it all here.
2628580	2631240	Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse
2631240	2632580	since I made that video.
2632580	2634400	I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.
2634400	2637520	True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people,
2637520	2639340	because she's not a complete idiot,
2639340	2642140	but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.
2642140	2644380	She said, save our children.
2644380	2645840	I love homosexuals.
2645840	2647780	For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke
2647780	2650020	doesn't say, I hate black people,
2650020	2652260	but he will share a lot of statistics
2652260	2654140	about anti-white crime.
2654140	2655000	So this is not really,
2655000	2659600	a very good criterion for deciding who's a bigot, is it?
2659600	2662480	What JK Rowling does do is tweet again and again
2662480	2664320	about transgender rapists,
2664320	2667180	about the danger trans women pose to cis women.
2667180	2669340	She implies that trans-inclusive language
2669340	2672640	is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.
2672640	2675940	She writes at length about the vague nefarious cabal
2675940	2678100	of endocrinologists and ideologue
2678100	2680520	that is supposedly persuading
2680520	2683480	confused vulnerable girls to transition.
2683480	2684220	To quote Washington Post opinion,
2684220	2686580	writer Monica Hess,
2686580	2688820	I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,
2688820	2690480	but reading her Twitter feed,
2690480	2692200	this is the overall effect.
2692200	2695160	Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think.
2695160	2697020	It asks them to fear.
2697020	2701300	It creates phobias of trans people.
2701300	2706300	It creates trans-phobias, if you will.
2706400	2708700	Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician,
2708700	2712920	Nicola Sturgeon, calling her a destroyer of women's rights
2712920	2714060	via a t-shirt.
2714060	2717100	This is what she got from anti-trans hate-monger Posey Parker.
2717100	2718600	There's no such thing as a trans woman.
2718600	2720760	There's no such thing as a trans person.
2720760	2721720	There is no such thing.
2721720	2724380	If there's one thing that I want people to understand
2724380	2726080	about Rowling's transphobia,
2726080	2729140	it's that this is not a case of someone posting
2729140	2730720	a couple insensitive tweets
2730720	2732380	that got blown out of proportion.
2732380	2736320	Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent of trans rights.
2736320	2739320	This has been her main issue for several years now.
2739320	2741580	And because she's so famous,
2741580	2743460	she's become the de facto global champion,
2743460	2744020	of trans women.
2744020	2746580	A champion of backlash to trans rights.
2746580	2749180	Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.
2749180	2752060	Except worse, because she's way more famous
2752060	2755180	and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.
2755180	2758520	Rowling has also praised self-described theocratic fascist,
2758520	2761400	Matt Walsh, for his transphobic propaganda film.
2761400	2765340	She refers to trans women as trans-identified males,
2765340	2768080	known as Tims, among people for whom this has become
2768080	2769240	an unhealthy obsession.
2769240	2771420	She retweets images of the trans colors
2771420	2773420	being erased from the progress flag.
2773420	2775720	Also, the colors representing queer people of color.
2775720	2777080	So, you know, great.
2777080	2777860	Love that.
2777860	2780580	Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic
2780580	2784100	for the principled and valiant purpose of defending lesbians.
2784100	2786360	It's something of a fixation for her.
2786360	2788460	I find this particularly gross,
2788460	2790960	because it plays into the lesbophobic trope
2790960	2793620	that gay women are especially anti-trans,
2793620	2796720	when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic
2796720	2797720	of cis people.
2797720	2800400	According to a survey of young adults in the UK,
2800400	2803220	lesbians were most likely to know a trans person,
2803420	2806680	and also most likely, at 96%,
2806680	2808060	to say that they're supportive,
2808060	2810260	or very supportive of trans people.
2810260	2813680	So I think it's fair to say that most gay women
2813680	2815960	are probably not super thrilled
2815960	2819660	whenever Joe Rowe, the lesbian defender, logs on.
2819660	2821720	My own partner is a cis lesbian,
2821720	2824180	and I asked her if she enjoys JK Rowling
2824180	2827520	defending her from the transsexuals, and she said,
2827520	2830340	It makes me want to gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.
2830340	2833220	By the way, here is JK Rowling enjoying a bit
2833220	2836780	of banter with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,
2836780	2839400	the co-founder of Rowling's charity, Lumos.
2839400	2841320	Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member
2841320	2843640	of the House of Lords who voted against
2843640	2846060	same-sex marriage in 2013.
2846060	2849120	In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,
2849120	2851240	claiming that gay marriage would lead to
2851240	2854300	degrading the status of women and girls.
2854300	2857320	Truly one of the great lesbian allies.
2857320	2859900	And in 2022, here is JK Rowling
2859900	2862340	joking around with Lady Nicholson.
2862340	2863060	Excellent question.
2863060	2863900	Emma.
2863900	2867280	Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women
2867280	2871120	excludes and depresses the most marginalized of all groups,
2871120	2875520	i.e. people with penises and beards who want to shag women.
2875520	2878780	And before you say, but aren't they straight men?
2878780	2881840	They're wearing eyeliner, bigot.
2881840	2885320	Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia you may have
2885320	2887120	for the Gryffindor common room,
2887120	2889760	and just look at this interaction for what it is.
2889760	2893040	Two straight women, one of whom is a homophobic peer
2893040	2896140	of the realm, having a nice little chuckle together
2896140	2899220	about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.
2899220	2900800	So that's it, right?
2900800	2901700	It's over.
2903700	2904920	Case closed.
2907240	2908920	I still like hammering things.
2910380	2913220	I'm not gonna argue anymore about whether JK Rowling
2913220	2916940	is transphobic, because anyone who believes in transphobia
2916940	2919660	can see that obviously she is.
2919660	2922880	The question now is whether transphobia is the sort of
2922880	2925380	thing that progressives can denounce,
2925380	2928400	the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,
2928400	2930360	misogyny, and homophobia.
2930360	2931940	That's usually what we're talking about
2931940	2934140	when we talk about JK Rowling, right?
2934140	2936980	Whether it's fair to cancel her.
2936980	2940480	That's what the witch trials of JK Rowling is about.
2940480	2943920	The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.
2943920	2946700	Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint
2946700	2949620	worthy of polite consideration and respect
2949620	2951760	in liberal, humane society?
2951760	2952660	Or, is it just an option?
2952660	2953960	Or is it just an ugly prejudice
2953960	2956060	that we can justifiably react to
2956060	2958040	with scorn and condemnation?
2958040	2960120	And there's an even broader question here
2960120	2963660	about whether we can justifiably react to anything
2963660	2965520	with scorn and condemnation.
2965520	2967920	Is canceling ever warranted?
2967920	2972260	Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?
2972260	2975840	Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices
2975840	2979320	a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas
2979320	2982200	where we can all sit around debating the legitimacy
2982200	2986220	of gay marriage or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?
2986220	2988960	Is the final solution a myth promulgated
2988960	2990840	by the international Jew?
2990840	2994380	Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?
2994380	2997240	Wouldn't the taxpayers save a lot of money
2997240	2999720	if there weren't so many disabled people?
2999720	3000760	Who knows?
3000760	3002340	These are open questions.
3002340	3006300	Let's sit down with people on both sides, on many sides,
3006300	3009160	and have calm, civil conversations about it
3009160	3011600	for the rest of our goddamn lives.
3012200	3014280	Five, debate.
3016220	3018200	Sar, I know I did this look before
3018200	3021480	and it's like not related to the video topic at all,
3021480	3023320	but it just makes me feel slithing.
3023320	3025620	The boy who slithed.
3025620	3027860	So Megan Phelps-Roberts' viewpoint seems to be
3027860	3031140	that scorn and condemnation are never appropriate,
3031140	3033040	that we should approach every conflict
3033040	3034640	with empathy and compassion,
3034640	3036540	even when dealing with the worst,
3036540	3039540	most destructive people in the world.
3039540	3040980	Hi, my name is Megan,
3040980	3041980	and my heretical friend, Megan Phelps, is a gay man.
3041980	3043960	My heretical belief is that even the people
3043960	3046040	who seem to be the worst,
3046040	3048100	most destructive people in the world
3048100	3051660	are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy
3051660	3053600	if we want to find a way to change their minds.
3053600	3055800	In her book, in her TED Talk,
3055800	3057660	in her public appearances,
3057660	3059640	Megan expresses the idea
3059640	3062640	that society has recently become polarized
3062640	3065000	in some unprecedented way,
3065000	3067540	that we've all become extremists,
3067540	3070380	that in some sense, we've all become
3070380	3071760	the Westboro Baptist Church.
3071980	3074660	I can't help but see in our public discourse
3074660	3077200	so many of the same destructive impulses
3077200	3079000	that ruled my former church.
3079000	3081260	She identifies things like certainty,
3081260	3083300	vilification of compromise,
3083300	3085160	us versus them thinking,
3085160	3086880	suppression of empathy,
3086880	3089440	and celebration of death and misfortune
3089440	3093020	as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.
3093020	3094840	And this really bothers Megan,
3094840	3097620	because she claims that a decade ago,
3097620	3099180	when she went on Twitter to tweet about
3099180	3101860	how marriage is abominable to God,
3101980	3104580	it was people who engaged her in a civil,
3104580	3107660	rational way that eventually led her
3107660	3110220	to renouncing Westboro's ideology.
3110220	3114160	And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.
3114160	3115920	She's totally right that if you want
3115920	3117500	to change people's minds,
3117500	3120300	then approaching them with compassion and empathy
3120300	3122920	is usually the best way to do that.
3122920	3124860	But Megan reaches another conclusion
3124860	3126300	that I don't agree with,
3126300	3129700	which is that because compassion and civil conversation
3129700	3131700	are most likely to persuade people,
3131700	3134400	we should never cancel anyone,
3134400	3136760	even the most horrible bigots.
3136760	3140420	And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point.
3140420	3143140	But what Megan means is we shouldn't say mean things
3143140	3143980	to bigots.
3143980	3146540	We shouldn't boycott or counter-protest
3146540	3148180	or raise our voices.
3148180	3151000	We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone,
3151000	3154140	because that's just not how you change minds.
3154140	3156080	And I get why Megan thinks this, right?
3156080	3158940	De-radicalization was a really important part
3158940	3160560	of her life experience.
3160560	3161340	She's also clearly holding out
3161340	3163520	hope that other members of her family
3163520	3166260	will leave Westboro and have a life on the outside.
3166260	3168560	She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.
3168560	3170820	The last lines of her book address her family.
3170820	3172760	"'I want to tell them that I love them.
3172760	3174760	I'll just have to find another way.'"
3174760	3176680	This is touching and human
3176680	3179740	and also kind of a conflict of interest.
3179740	3183500	The problem is Megan's views about this only makes sense
3183500	3187340	if you assume that Megan is the main character of reality.
3187340	3190580	If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots
3190580	3193860	is more important than protecting the people they target.
3193860	3196420	Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds
3196420	3199920	is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.
3199920	3203320	As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old
3203320	3205620	and she's still homophobic.
3205620	3207740	But even without Anita's blessing,
3207740	3211120	gay rights have still somehow managed to progress
3211120	3212760	since the 1970s.
3212760	3216720	Because gay activists didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.
3216720	3218960	They needed to defeat her.
3218960	3220340	And that's what they did.
3220580	3222820	We have to accept that realistically,
3222820	3226340	persuading all the bigots is just not an option.
3226340	3229700	Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,
3229700	3231820	but there will always be bigots.
3231820	3235300	And mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them
3235300	3238100	is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.
3238100	3240940	Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,
3240940	3245180	we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?
3245180	3246020	Gnar.
3246020	3249300	You would only think that if you're a total moral relativist.
3249300	3249860	I guess controversial opinions are the only way to do that.
3249860	3253360	It's not a controversial opinion, but bigotry is shameful.
3253360	3254820	And it should be shamed.
3254820	3255820	I'll say it.
3255820	3259300	You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas in your head,
3259300	3262220	you might feel afraid to express them publicly
3262220	3265240	for fear of being shamed or judged.
3265240	3268260	Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia
3268260	3270740	that punishes people for wrong-think?
3270740	3274460	No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful
3274460	3276100	and you should be ashamed of it
3276100	3278700	and the people judging you are right to do so.
3278700	3279700	And sure, there are some very, very, very, very,
3279700	3282620	very patient people who devote their lives
3282620	3284380	to de-radicalizing bigots,
3284380	3287680	which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.
3287680	3289380	There's a guy named Daryl Davis
3289380	3291840	who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan
3291840	3293300	for over 30 years,
3293300	3297200	and he claims he's convinced more than 200 of them to leave.
3297200	3298540	And good for him.
3298540	3301320	De-radicalization is a valid strategy,
3301320	3303760	but it cannot be the only strategy
3303760	3306960	and it must not be the primary strategy.
3306960	3309140	Because we're not going to defeat racism
3309140	3312840	by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.
3312840	3315100	Feminists would be wasting their time
3315100	3318160	trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.
3318160	3320580	In general, I think that the massive effort
3320580	3323340	that it takes to maybe persuade bigots
3323340	3326100	is better spent persuading other people
3326100	3327540	not to listen to them.
3327540	3330520	And it's also worth cautioning that de-radicalization
3330520	3333760	is often a messy and incomplete process.
3333760	3336860	20-year-old white nationalist Peter Sejtanovic
3336860	3339020	became the face of the fascist Unite the Right,
3339020	3341460	the right rally in 2017
3341460	3345920	when a photo of him mid-scream, tiki torch in hand,
3345920	3348980	was published in news outlets all over the country.
3348980	3351280	Peter was unrepentant in interviews
3351280	3353600	he gave immediately after the rally,
3353600	3355960	but he began to question his beliefs
3355960	3358620	after befriending a Muslim woman who,
3358620	3360960	according to Charlotte MacDonald Gibson,
3360960	3363720	challenged his views without insulting him,
3363720	3367100	allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.
3367100	3368780	Peter is no longer a white nationalist,
3368780	3371400	but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out
3371400	3373100	every trace of bigotry.
3373100	3376160	In a 2019 interview with the London School of Economics
3376160	3378220	student paper, Peter said,
3378220	3380340	I don't like the whole transgender thing.
3380340	3382540	You're born either a man or a woman.
3382540	3386420	So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.
3386420	3389220	When I did de-radicalization work on YouTube,
3389220	3392120	I used to get some criticism from people of color
3392120	3394300	who were not thrilled that I was bringing
3394300	3397800	a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,
3397800	3398260	a frustration that I don't like, but I do like.
3398260	3398760	I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.
3398780	3399280	I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.
3399280	3399780	I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.
3399780	3400280	I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.
3400280	3403120	To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,
3403120	3407400	diverse leftist communities are maybe not the best holding space
3407400	3408400	for someone who's
3408400	3410560	a bit of a Nazi but working on it.
3410560	3412740	In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,
3412740	3415820	I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,
3415820	3419720	but what she does have is a kind of hypervigilant skepticism
3419720	3423180	about anything she perceives as ideology.
3423180	3424720	This is pretty common with people
3424720	3427160	who used to be religious fundamentalists.
3427160	3428260	They were so certain they were right,
3428260	3431760	only to realize that everything they believed
3431760	3433420	about the world is wrong.
3433420	3437420	So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions
3437420	3440500	because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.
3440500	3441940	Coming from Westboro,
3441940	3445660	where I believed so strongly that I was doing the right thing
3445660	3447420	and then to leave and come to believe
3447420	3449620	that it was so destructive and harmful,
3450800	3455800	I had this moment in time and it lasted for many months
3455800	3457380	where I was like,
3457380	3459820	how can I ever trust my own mind again?
3459820	3463240	This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,
3463240	3467220	but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else
3467220	3468760	can cause problems,
3468760	3472440	especially where topics of social justice are concerned.
3472440	3475560	Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism
3475560	3476560	that asks,
3476560	3481540	why are marginalized people so unwilling to have calm,
3481540	3484760	philosophical debates about whether they should have rights?
3484760	3487220	Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?
3487220	3490140	Atheist philosopher Sam Harris,
3490140	3492740	in his podcast about Megan's podcast,
3492740	3495120	can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?
3495120	3498640	I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts
3498640	3500800	until we can figure out what's going on.
3500800	3504460	Sam Harris, in his podcast about Megan's podcast,
3504460	3508600	complained that trans activism and activism in general
3508600	3512860	is plagued by mental illness and hysteria.
3512860	3515860	I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.
3515860	3516700	I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.
3516700	3517200	I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.
3517220	3522760	and even frank mental illness in the activist community.
3522760	3525900	I mean, in really in all activist communities.
3525900	3531100	The level of viciousness and hysteria is,
3531100	3533300	you know, it's hard to know what to compare it to.
3533300	3535160	Diversity when...
3535160	3538180	Man accuses trans women of being hysterical.
3538180	3542080	Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions
3542080	3545820	when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?
3545820	3547200	Aren't there certain situations
3547200	3549380	where strong emotions are warranted?
3549540	3551300	It reminds me of this awful episode
3551300	3553620	of Joe Rogan feat Ben Shapiro,
3553900	3556720	where little Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral
3556720	3559040	with his usual whining sophistry.
3559380	3561360	And Joe gently raises objections
3561360	3563340	for Ben to talk circles around.
3563640	3567060	The human sex drive was made to procreate
3567060	3568420	within a stable relationship
3568420	3570360	in order to progenerate
3570360	3571840	and have future generations of people.
3572260	3574080	Misuse of that sex drive in any way,
3574180	3576460	whether you're talking about from masturbation
3576460	3577760	to homosexual activity,
3578400	3580840	is therefore a diminishment of the use of that drive.
3580920	3583940	That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.
3584020	3587360	All of the top comments on this video are like this.
3587540	3589160	Imagine talking about different beliefs
3589160	3591060	while still having a productive conversation.
3591360	3593320	Things progress when you don't demonize people.
3593480	3594860	The discussion here was excellent.
3595060	3596560	Two guys with opposing opinions,
3596800	3599240	speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,
3599460	3602060	shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.
3602620	3603800	This is how it should be done.
3604260	3605280	Kudos to both of them.
3605280	3606440	Joe is a great interviewer.
3606680	3608000	He can totally disagree with someone
3608000	3610060	and still have a calm, collective conversation.
3610480	3611440	This is how it should be.
3611720	3613100	Just two people sharing ideas,
3613240	3614860	learning different point of views from each other.
3615120	3617000	This is why Joe is the number one podcast.
3617200	3619320	Joe Rogan beautifully asked the tough questions.
3619620	3620700	And Ben answers honestly.
3621140	3622320	He is strong in his faith.
3622560	3625340	I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views
3625340	3626760	and they have a civil conversation.
3627200	3627740	Great learning.
3627900	3630680	And like, yeah, it's easy for two straight men
3630680	3633880	to have a dispassionate theoretical conversation
3633880	3636220	about the ethics of homosexuality.
3636540	3638180	Because it's not their lives
3638180	3640880	and their relationships that are up for debate.
3641400	3644080	These people don't understand the emotional burden
3644080	3645820	placed on marginalized people
3645820	3648280	who are asked to defend their rights.
3648500	3649420	Like, if you're straight,
3649420	3652060	do you want to publicly debate
3652060	3653920	whether your marriage is valid?
3654400	3655980	Andrew Dworkin claimed that
3655980	3657960	penetrative heterosexual intercourse
3657960	3660180	is inherently an act of violence.
3660420	3662460	I've noticed that most straight men
3662460	3666060	don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that.
3666340	3666440	So if you're straight,
3666440	3667820	imagine how they'd react
3667820	3670160	if there was a powerful political movement
3670160	3672060	to criminalize penetration
3672060	3674060	or revoke their right to marry.
3674300	3676320	Add in a lifetime of ostracism,
3676620	3677500	family rejection,
3678080	3679400	bullying, and discrimination,
3680000	3682660	and maybe then you'll begin to understand
3682660	3685500	the hysteria of a lot of queer people.
3685720	3687560	It is my right to raise my child
3687560	3688760	with the moral precept
3688760	3691060	that I find to be beneficial for my child.
3691720	3693300	Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.
3693840	3694500	And if he tries,
3694580	3695740	I will meet him at the door with a gun.
3695740	3696380	That is insane.
3696380	3699720	Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence
3699720	3702040	because he can't handle the debate.
3702220	3705100	Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.
3705360	3708300	Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation
3708300	3710960	about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?
3711300	3712020	I now have two choices.
3712160	3713860	One is to leave the country utterly.
3714320	3715080	Two is to pick up a gun.
3715260	3716760	Those are the only choices that you have left me.
3717000	3719500	Dave Rubin is a gay conservative
3719500	3722060	whose career requires that he convince
3722060	3725640	his right-wing audience that he's one of the good ones.
3725640	3726260	This means that he's not the only one
3726260	3727980	who's willing to sit across
3727980	3729520	from his so-called friend,
3729900	3731540	homophobe Ben Shapiro,
3731980	3733280	and listen to Ben say
3733280	3735900	he would never attend his anniversary party
3735900	3739040	because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.
3739360	3740920	There's a difference between me
3740920	3742380	just being friends with Dave
3742380	3745940	and me actively participating in an event
3745940	3747920	that I feel is religiously sinful.
3748140	3750420	The two of them then congratulate themselves
3750420	3753160	about how they can still be great friends.
3753580	3755840	Why is it that we're able to do this?
3755840	3755880	Why is it that we're able to do this?
3756260	3757500	And most people can't do this.
3757580	3758700	That's what I'm curious about.
3758700	3760620	We go home at night and we can have our own lives.
3760740	3763060	And here's Dave having a civil conversation
3763060	3764880	with conservative Glenn Beck,
3764980	3767720	who compares homosexuality to alcoholism
3767720	3769340	and then congratulates himself
3769340	3771400	on having the conversation.
3771860	3773660	I'm a deeply religious man
3773660	3775880	and my religion says
3775880	3777780	man and a woman,
3778360	3781400	that is the basic building block of family.
3781560	3783480	And that's what I believe,
3783480	3785480	but I also am,
3786260	3790100	and I also know God created you
3790100	3791740	just like he created me,
3792100	3793080	flaws and all.
3793860	3796860	You know, I believe I have a gene,
3796940	3797760	they've never found it,
3797820	3801300	that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism
3801300	3803100	because it runs in my family.
3803660	3804600	So does craziness,
3804720	3806480	but it runs in my family.
3806780	3808840	Well, Dave smiles and nods,
3808940	3810640	probably because he's thinking about
3810640	3812900	how much he enjoys the taste of boots.
3814100	3816240	Usually I just take out a picture
3816300	3819020	of me and DeSantis and then we're good
3819020	3821200	because they get it, they get it,
3821260	3822860	that's my governor, yeah.
3823020	3825540	I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin
3825540	3827640	and they see, finally,
3828260	3829960	a reasonable gay person
3829960	3831080	who doesn't scream,
3831540	3833880	beg it, at everyone who disagrees
3833880	3836620	and can actually have a civil conversation.
3836980	3838340	But that's not what I see.
3838560	3839740	I look at Dave Rubin
3839740	3842000	and I see a sabineless,
3842300	3843900	boot-licking doormat
3843900	3845960	who won't even defend his own family.
3845960	3846060	who won't even defend his own family.
3846060	3846820	who won't even defend his own family.
3846820	3849600	from the most fundamental disrespect.
3849600	3851440	I also can't help but notice
3851440	3854220	that none of these civil conversations
3854220	3856560	seem to change anyone's mind.
3856560	3858940	Persuasion is more complicated
3858940	3861440	and less rational than people think.
3861440	3865180	Megan often says that she was de-radicalized on Twitter,
3865180	3867300	but if you read her book carefully,
3867300	3870100	you'll notice that that's not exactly true.
3870100	3871900	The major precipitating event
3871900	3873820	for Megan's crisis of faith
3873820	3875760	was her mother's mistreatment
3875760	3878420	at the hands of an increasingly misogynistic
3878420	3879840	church leadership
3879840	3882460	that made Megan feel like she was the victim
3882460	3883800	of the church for once.
3883800	3885960	She says of the church discipline,
3885960	3887960	For the first time in my life,
3887960	3889800	the accused were people I lived with
3889800	3891380	and knew most intimately,
3891380	3892800	and I knew that the judgments
3892800	3894680	leveled by the elders were wrong.
3894680	3896560	I could no longer blindly trust
3896560	3898300	the judgment of these men.
3898300	3901000	So she finally experienced firsthand
3901000	3903600	what it's like to be the victim of her family.
3903600	3905600	She stopped voting for the leopards-eating,
3905600	3907220	people's faces party
3907220	3909640	only when the leopards ate her face.
3909640	3911900	It also seems relevant to notice
3911900	3914840	that the people who had calm, civil conversations
3914840	3918440	with Megan on Twitter were generally not gay people,
3918440	3921640	the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.
3921640	3923560	They were mostly straight men,
3923560	3925800	like director Kevin Smith,
3925800	3928220	who started hashtag SaveMegan
3928220	3931680	because, quote, she's hot.
3931680	3935300	There's often an erotic component to persuasion,
3935300	3938220	and that certainly seems to be the case with Megan
3938220	3942000	because one of the people who helped de-radicalize her
3942000	3943760	is now her husband.
3943760	3945960	And I feel like that's a relevant detail
3945960	3949180	if we're trying to understand the role of reason and emotion
3949180	3951680	in de-radicalization experiences.
3951680	3953960	I think this experience is usually more
3953960	3956380	akin to religious conversion
3956380	3958600	than it is to logical reasoning.
3958600	3960140	There's also a world of difference
3960140	3962760	between the mostly private conversations
3962760	3964920	that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs,
3964920	3967920	and the spectacle of public debate.
3967920	3971340	Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic
3971340	3975300	because he livestreamed a civil conversation with Dave Rubin.
3975300	3977880	So who is this conversation even for?
3977880	3980460	Well, obviously, it's for the audience.
3980460	3984720	I think these civil conversations basically function
3984720	3987460	to reassure a homophobic audience
3987460	3991580	that just because they disagree with the lifestyle
3991580	3994380	doesn't mean that they hate gay people.
3994380	3995760	Look at Ben Shapiro.
3995760	3997540	He is friends with a gay.
3997540	4000580	Public debate is one way that we define the limits
4000580	4002140	of the Overton window,
4002140	4005760	the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.
4005760	4008140	So often people who want to promote bigotry
4008140	4011380	will use debate as a foot in the door.
4011380	4014220	It's a way of establishing that their prejudices
4014220	4016220	are within the realm of reasonable
4016220	4018300	and socially accepted opinion.
4018300	4022000	Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot Graham Linehan
4022000	4023920	in a fury that a drag queen,
4023920	4026500	that a drag queen is on Doctor Who
4026500	4030040	without the British public having a proper debate
4030040	4031420	about these issues.
4031420	4034720	Now, why do we need to have a proper debate
4034720	4038540	about whether drag queens should be allowed on television
4038540	4040920	when drag performance has been a staple
4040920	4042460	of British entertainment
4042460	4044920	since at least the time of Shakespeare?
4044920	4047000	Life is a joke, that's just begun.
4047000	4049720	Ha, ha, ha, ha, high five.
4049720	4051580	Three little maids from school.
4051580	4053040	Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.
4053920	4055920	As I am man,
4057920	4061680	my state is desperate for my master's love.
4061680	4065920	As I am woman, now alas the day.
4065920	4069120	Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate
4069120	4070680	on their own terms
4070680	4073840	because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.
4073840	4075880	It's how they convince the public
4075880	4079380	that their moral panic about drag queens on TV
4079380	4081800	is actually a valid concern.
4081800	4083540	Rather than the tedious,
4083540	4087160	small-minded whining about nothing that it really is.
4087160	4089960	Having the debate on a bigot's terms
4089960	4092540	is not a good way to win people over
4092540	4094300	unless you're really skilled
4094300	4096460	in the art of humiliating people,
4096460	4099160	which most of the time is what public debate
4099160	4100700	is actually about.
4100700	4102340	This is something that J.K. Rowling
4102340	4104240	doesn't seem to understand.
4104240	4106380	In the witch trials of J.K. Rowling,
4106380	4110580	Joro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.
4110580	4113300	She brings up right-wing provocateur,
4113300	4114600	Milo Yiannopoulos,
4114600	4118180	saying that activists are making a strategic error
4118180	4122060	and giving Milo power by protesting his events,
4122060	4125060	making him look dangerous and sexy.
4125060	4128000	But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,
4128000	4130960	Rowling characterizes this as silencing.
4130960	4133420	So is deplatforming a strategic error
4133420	4135680	that gives power to your opponent,
4135680	4138260	or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?
4138260	4139720	I find Rowling's conviction
4139720	4141960	that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos
4141960	4143260	really out of touch.
4143300	4146000	Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons
4146000	4147180	for the things he does.
4147180	4150540	He has strategies for humiliating people.
4150540	4152460	I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,
4152460	4154540	being fabulous and doing my hair,
4154540	4155880	to prepare a speech for you.
4155880	4157260	Well, a few remarks, really.
4159060	4161220	Feminism is cancer.
4161220	4162600	Thank you very much.
4162600	4164640	To again quote Ian Danskin,
4164640	4166800	you can't really reason with someone
4166800	4169180	who thinks that feminism is cancer,
4169180	4171340	because you don't reason with cancer.
4171340	4172600	You eradicate it.
4172600	4174760	Rowling objects to the slogan,
4174760	4177640	no debate, in the strongest possible terms.
4177640	4180720	And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,
4180720	4183760	the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.
4183760	4185520	We hear it all the time.
4185520	4189300	That alarms me, really alarms me.
4189300	4192680	I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism
4192680	4193560	than no debate.
4193560	4194720	It's kind of amazing to me
4194720	4197680	that someone could think angry trans people on Twitter
4197680	4200840	are the purest example of authoritarianism.
4200840	4202440	I truly hope that one day,
4202440	4206400	I am privileged enough to be capable of such a perspective.
4206400	4208780	Before I move on, I do want to clarify
4208780	4211680	that I do think there are trans issues
4211680	4215280	that are legitimately debatable by people who are not bigots.
4215280	4218940	In my opinion, trans women and women's sports
4218940	4220400	is one of those issues.
4220400	4222820	But it's a complicated issue.
4222820	4226740	Like, first of all, which sport are we talking about?
4226740	4228900	Are we talking about figure skating?
4228900	4230940	Middle school field hockey?
4230940	4231680	I see no reason why trans women and women's sports,
4231680	4234640	I see no reason why trans girls should be excluded from that.
4234640	4237180	But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,
4237180	4240220	well, then it seems plausible that trans women
4240220	4242060	who have been through male puberty
4242060	4245440	may still retain some kind of group advantage.
4245440	4249180	But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.
4249180	4251220	People are transitioning younger now,
4251220	4253560	and that's another thing you have to consider.
4253560	4256480	So I'm not against debating this issue.
4256480	4260480	I just want people to approach it with nuance and good faith.
4260480	4261640	And currently, I'm not against it.
4261640	4264220	A lot of the people who are vocally against
4264220	4268020	trans women and women's sports sound like this.
4268020	4272300	And we will keep men out of women's sports.
4272300	4274520	Right?
4274520	4278760	How ridiculous.
4278760	4280720	That will take place on day one.
4280720	4282480	And I don't want to debate those people.
4282480	4285220	I want to serve them a banana creme pie.
4285220	4288840	Chapter 6. Illiberal Methods.
4288840	4291520	One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints about men being too aggressive is that,
4291640	4297880	the trans rights movement is she sees it as illiberal in its methods so when i first became
4297880	4305240	interested and then deeply troubled by what i saw as a cultural movement that was illiberal
4305240	4311560	in its methods so what are these illiberal methods if you are saying this person is
4312440	4319640	cancelled that is the language of a dictator it's true cancel culture is exactly how the third reich
4319640	4325960	started first they cancelled the socialists and i did not speak out because the hashtag was trending
4325960	4328760	but maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks
4344760	4348840	you know i can't help but wonder what counts as acceptable activist methods
4348840	4349620	to an author from
4349640	4357640	whom hermione protesting slavery was taking things too far i am fighting what i see as a powerful
4357640	4365480	insidious misogynistic movement i do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless
4365480	4370040	rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement is dangerous and authoritarian
4370040	4375320	in some unprecedented way that makes it different from all past liberation movements
4375320	4378840	but how what are these illiberal methods that distinguish trans
4378840	4384860	rights activism from similar past movements canceling anita bryant was way more cancelled
4384860	4390680	than jk rowling ever will be boycotts boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement
4390680	4396280	in modern history disrupting feminist meetings disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist
4396280	4402600	tradition haven't you heard of the lavender menace in 1969 betty friedan author of the feminine mystique
4402600	4407480	and founder of the national organization for women and second wave feminism in general coined the
4407480	4408680	phrase lavender menace
4408840	4413000	to describe the threat she believed that lesbians posed
4413000	4414260	to the women's movement.
4414260	4417680	Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians
4417680	4419580	would make it easy to dismiss the movement
4419580	4421600	as a bunch of mannish man-haters.
4421600	4424500	This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians
4424500	4428220	who attended the second Congress to Unite Women in 1970
4428220	4430880	to stage what used to be known as a ZAP,
4430880	4434100	a disruptive public protest designed to draw attention
4434100	4435540	to gay rights issues.
4435540	4437720	Think glitter bombing, think pies.
4437720	4439560	Half aggression, half whimsy.
4439560	4441720	Like that time the Lesbian Avengers zapped
4441720	4444120	Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house,
4444120	4445520	demanding that she resign.
4445520	4447560	This podcast has pushed me over the edge.
4447560	4451100	Centrism has gone too far, and I am now pro-cancel culture.
4451100	4453020	So just as the meeting was beginning,
4453020	4456460	a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts
4456460	4459440	switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic,
4459440	4462260	and charged down the aisles, laughing and screaming.
4462260	4465060	Their leader, Rita Mae Brown, took the mic and yelled,
4465060	4466960	"'This conference won't proceed
4466960	4467720	"'until we talk about it.'
4467720	4469760	"'Let's talk about lesbians and the women's movement.'"
4469760	4471840	One of the NOW organizers yelled back,
4471840	4474760	"'I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.
4474760	4476560	"'You're acting like men.'"
4476560	4478340	Betty Friedan would later speculate
4478340	4480680	that the lesbians were a CIA PSYOP
4480680	4483180	designed to make the women's movement look bad.
4483180	4486100	So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting
4486100	4487920	using illiberal tactics,
4487920	4490060	not because they were against feminism,
4490060	4493060	but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists
4493060	4494100	to include them.
4494100	4495680	It's the same thing that's happening today
4495680	4497680	when trans people disrupt feminist meetings.
4497720	4499380	As J.K. Rowling puts it,
4499380	4501260	interestingly neglecting to mention
4501260	4503220	which feminist meetings these are.
4503220	4505560	I was starting to see activists behaving
4505560	4508340	in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.
4508340	4511140	There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging
4511140	4513800	and kicking on windows, very threatening.
4513800	4517020	There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea
4517020	4520020	that trans activists are somehow more aggressive
4520020	4521800	than similar past movements.
4521800	4523920	Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man
4523920	4526340	called Dennis Noel Kavanaugh, who says,
4526340	4527560	all those gay rights movements,
4527560	4529020	gay rights and AIDS protests,
4529020	4531360	I don't remember a single one
4531360	4534320	where we intimidated or silenced a woman.
4534320	4536600	Not a single one.
4536600	4538800	Not a single one.
4538800	4540440	Not a single one.
4540440	4545440	Not a single one.
4546360	4549140	Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS
4549140	4550520	to the trans movement.
4550520	4553140	And also, quote,
4553140	4555600	I will fucking nail you to a wall
4555600	4557320	what you have done to these innocent women.
4557320	4558700	what you have done to these innocent women.
4558700	4561820	Your mutilation of these little humand
4561820	4563820	because they were gay will be nothing
4563820	4568360	compared to what I will do to you legally.
4568360	4570080	You think you are ghouls,
4570080	4573860	wait till I deal with you bastard and I mean to.
4573860	4576860	Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.
4576860	4579900	I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people
4579900	4583200	to a wall count as illiberal methods?
4583200	4585280	I guess JK Rowling doesn't think so
4585280	4586780	because she's never condemned it.
4586780	4589440	In fact, when Dennis's Twitter suspension ended,
4589440	4591620	she was right there to welcome him back.
4591620	4593400	And she continues to retweet him.
4593400	4595080	I've always been happy to acknowledge
4595080	4597080	that angry trans people on Twitter
4597080	4599080	sometimes take things too far.
4599080	4602320	Things like death threats or misogynistic insults,
4602320	4605020	I don't support that and I've called it out in the past.
4605020	4607820	Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,
4607820	4609980	drama alert, who is not trans,
4609980	4611400	tweeted at JK Rowling,
4611400	4614860	women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.
4614860	4616620	I called him out, tweeting,
4616620	4620120	doing edgy, ironic misogyny while defending trans people
4620120	4622740	magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say
4622740	4625580	about there being misogyny in trans activism.
4625580	4627620	I tweeted that because I recognize
4627620	4629820	that if people who are claiming to speak for you
4629820	4632120	are doing so in a misogynistic way,
4632120	4633860	and if you let that slide,
4633860	4635420	you're going to wake up one day to find
4635420	4637460	that you're in a misogynistic movement.
4637460	4639920	Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well,
4639920	4641700	explaining that actually,
4641700	4645080	I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments
4645080	4646460	for the moral necessity of being trans.
4646460	4648420	Being misogynistic to JK Rowling.
4648420	4650840	And then he accused me of cancel culturing him
4650840	4651840	while at the same time,
4651840	4654620	literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.
4654620	4657580	The more of you were in the replies being like,
4657580	4659080	that's not what's happening right here.
4659080	4661260	Like this is necessary, okay?
4661260	4665880	Publicly shame her into changing her mind on this.
4665880	4668340	Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.
4668340	4672260	Move you off this site and into,
4672260	4674000	I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.
4674000	4676300	So that pretty much confirmed to me that Vosh doesn't
4676300	4678640	actually care about advocating for trans people
4678640	4680920	and just uses trans rights as a pretext
4680920	4682380	to act like a fucking dingus.
4682380	4684380	I won't tell you to publicly shame him though,
4684380	4687180	because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.
4687180	4689800	The point I'm trying to make is I have no qualms
4689800	4692000	about calling out people on my side
4692000	4694420	whenever they go too far or cross a line
4694420	4696600	or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me
4696600	4699300	about how I don't understand tactical misogyny.
4699300	4700140	Idiot.
4700140	4702260	But the same cannot be said of JK Rowling.
4702260	4705720	I have never once seen her call out any of the bigotry and
4705720	4708520	abusiveness that is absolutely rampant
4708520	4710260	in the gender-critical movement.
4710260	4713520	There's a great video called JK Rowling's New Friends
4713520	4716380	by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty
4716380	4720180	of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists
4720180	4722480	versus the abusive trans mob.
4722480	4725560	A framing that the witch trials of JK Rowling accepts
4725560	4728800	uncritically, citing numerous examples of death threats
4728800	4731060	and abusiveness from trans advocates.
4731060	4734300	Things like, kill TERFs 2014.
4734300	4735480	How about slowly
4735480	4737280	and horrendously murder TERFs
4737280	4740180	in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?
4740180	4741820	Now, I don't think anyone should joke
4741820	4743900	about putting people in saw traps,
4743900	4746560	but also, how serious is this threat
4746560	4749560	that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?
4749560	4751780	Let's use our critical thinking skills here.
4751780	4756140	Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies,
4756140	4759140	has a Tumblr account and is threatening TERFs?
4759140	4761680	Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?
4761680	4765320	The podcast cites zero examples of death threats and abusiveness
4765320	4766940	from anti-trans bigots.
4766940	4770120	And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.
4770120	4773400	I can fill the screen up with examples just from people
4773400	4777160	who JK Rowling has explicitly supported or interacted with.
4777160	4780820	I will drive you out into the desert and bury you 9 feet down,
4780820	4783440	one tweet says, from a fan of JK Rowling.
4783440	4787080	First I'll set you on fire and piss on your half-alive corpse.
4787080	4791200	Fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.
4791200	4795160	Another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,
4795160	4795200	another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,
4795200	4795280	another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,
4795280	4795320	another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,
4795320	4799860	I don't know if I can even read it aloud without violating the YouTube terms of service.
4799860	4804120	But threats like this from the gender critical side are simply not mentioned
4804120	4806120	in the witch trials of JK Rowling.
4806120	4810200	Both Rowling and Megan seem happy to cherry-pick threatening tweets
4810200	4812440	and soundbites of shouting protesters
4812440	4814860	Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!
4814860	4818200	You look like you got your teeth knocked out of your fucking flashes!
4818200	4822200	as evidence that the trans movement is dangerous and insidious to the core.
4822200	4825200	But this exact technique has been used against literally
4825200	4828080	every liberation movement in world history.
4828080	4831580	For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night,
4831580	4834700	the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,
4834700	4838780	which first got JK Rowling interested in feminism in the 1970s.
4838780	4842540	Here's how The Guardian, Britain's spineless centrist paper of note,
4842540	4845900	covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.
4845900	4849620	Chanting slogans against rape seems reasonable to promote awareness,
4849620	4853000	but what about the hissing and swearing at any innocent male,
4853000	4855160	and cries of castrate men?
4855160	4859160	We were all sympathetic to the principles of the women's liberation movement,
4859160	4863660	but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women when it became clear
4863660	4869160	that my friend's brother was running the risk of personal mutilation if he remained with us.
4869160	4871160	The protesters were allegedly singing,
4871160	4876160	Here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.
4876160	4879660	So this is how the British press covered the women's movement.
4879660	4882160	Angry, torch-bearing women screaming,
4882160	4883660	Castrate men!
4883660	4885160	Now, is that a fair representation?
4885160	4886660	Of the women's movement?
4886660	4890660	Should we judge every movement by its most militant extremists?
4890660	4894160	Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanus,
4894160	4896160	who shot Andy Warhol,
4896160	4901160	who advocated for male extermination in her Society for Cutting Up Men manifesto,
4901160	4903660	is representative of feminism as a whole?
4903660	4907160	Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.
4907160	4909160	But it's not fair, is it?
4909160	4912660	So why does JK Rowling think it's fair to judge the trans movement
4912660	4915160	by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?
4915160	4917160	I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.
4917160	4919660	And I made excuses for you then.
4919660	4922660	In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of JK Rowling,
4922660	4926160	Megan interviews New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg,
4926160	4929160	who has written sympathetically about transphobic feminism.
4929160	4932160	There's a moment in this interview where Michelle kind of stumbles
4932160	4935660	into an honest observation that I find fascinating.
4935660	4938160	Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say,
4938160	4941160	you know, I'm not going to debate my basic humanity.
4941160	4944160	And part of the difficulty is that there are indeed certain issues
4944160	4947160	which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively
4947160	4950660	with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.
4950660	4954660	And I think that part of what is so difficult about this issue
4954660	4957660	is that there are certain people who think that this kind of consensus
4957660	4961660	can be imposed, maybe, as opposed to evolve organically.
4961660	4967660	And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up
4967660	4970160	in the hopes, I think, that if they can,
4970160	4974160	they will enjoy the same sort of assumed
4974160	4977160	protection as other groups whose rights we've decided
4977160	4980660	are not up for public conversation.
4980660	4983660	I think the problem is that we don't actually have a consensus.
4983660	4986660	So Michelle correctly observes that the reason trans people
4986660	4989660	are often reluctant to debate our rights is that we want
4989660	4992660	the same assumed protections as other groups whose rights
4992660	4995160	liberals have decided are not up for debate.
4995160	5000160	But then Michelle suggests that trans people have to debate our rights
5000160	5004160	because there isn't a mainstream consensus that we deserve rights.
5004160	5008160	I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg thinks that past
5008160	5010160	liberation movements have succeeded.
5010160	5014160	Like, does she think that women's suffrage just evolved organically?
5014160	5018160	Did suffragettes just have calm, civil conversations about whether
5018160	5022160	women are intellectually capable of voting until all the misogynists
5022160	5024160	were rationally persuaded?
5024160	5027160	No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote,
5027160	5030160	sometimes violently, especially in the UK.
5030160	5033160	Like, people forget this, maybe because they were called suffragettes,
5033160	5034160	which is kind of a cute thing.
5034160	5037160	But the suffragettes, they murdered people.
5037160	5039160	They were suffragette terrorists.
5039160	5040160	They broke windows.
5040160	5041160	They bombed churches.
5041160	5043160	They set fire to a theater.
5043160	5048160	In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill with a horse whip.
5048160	5049160	Queen shit, honestly.
5049160	5052160	The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet
5052160	5054160	at the Prime Minister's head.
5054160	5058160	And my point is not to advocate terrorism or to excuse the terrorism
5058160	5059160	of past movements.
5059160	5062160	I think these kinds of tactics have tended to turn people against
5062160	5063160	the movement.
5063160	5064160	I don't think it's effective.
5064160	5067160	But let's not pretend that past movements have never made demands
5067160	5069160	before everyone was ready.
5069160	5072160	Because there never has been and there never will be a time
5072160	5074160	when everyone is ready.
5074160	5077160	I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published The Vindication of the Rights
5077160	5079160	of Women in 1792.
5079160	5083160	And misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.
5083160	5086160	So there never has been a consensus about women's rights,
5086160	5088160	and there probably never will be.
5088160	5092160	In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights if there was a consensus
5092160	5094160	that we deserve rights.
5094160	5097160	The whole reason to have rights is to protect you from the kind of people
5097160	5099160	who think you shouldn't have them.
5099160	5102160	I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just politely persuade everyone
5102160	5106160	to give us rights, but the reality is that's not how this works,
5106160	5107160	and it never has been.
5107160	5110160	Like, how do these debate me centrists think that slavery ended
5110160	5112160	in the United States?
5112160	5117160	Well, between 1861 and 1865, there was a little event called
5117160	5119160	the American Civil Debate.
5119160	5121160	See what I'm holding in my hand?
5121160	5124160	This is a high-caliber idea that I picked off
5124160	5126160	the polite discussion field of Manassas.
5126160	5129160	Do you people think that American schools were integrated
5129160	5132160	because all the white people in the South were persuaded
5132160	5134160	that segregation is bad?
5134160	5135160	No dum-dums.
5135160	5138160	Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne to enforce that shit
5138160	5139160	at gunpoint.
5139160	5142160	And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements
5142160	5143160	with black civil rights.
5143160	5147160	I am aware that being a white queer person is not in any way equivalent
5147160	5149160	to living in the aftermath of slavery.
5149160	5151160	I'm just saying that there's this tendency to
5151160	5154160	sanitize history, and to imagine that progress was smooth
5154160	5158160	and bloodless, that consensus evolved organically,
5158160	5159160	when it just didn't.
5159160	5162160	And then people get the impression that current movements
5162160	5165160	are somehow more militant than successful past movements
5165160	5167160	when they just aren't.
5167160	5171160	I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,
5171160	5175160	misogynistic movement, a cultural movement that was
5175160	5177160	illiberal in its methods.
5177160	5181160	And I believe absolutely that there is something
5181160	5186160	dangerous about this movement, and it must be challenged.
5186160	5188160	Why is J.K. Rowling like this?
5192160	5195160	J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin,
5195160	5198160	whomst I've already mentioned a couple times in this video.
5198160	5200160	I myself favor violence.
5200160	5202160	Deeply, I favor it.
5202160	5205160	Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views,
5205160	5207160	which I don't agree with.
5207160	5210160	But she was an interesting writer, one of those half-crazed,
5210160	5215160	savantes who gets in your head, who you can't stop thinking about.
5215160	5219160	In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right Wing Women,
5219160	5224160	published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly and Anita Bryant.
5224160	5227160	Right Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women
5227160	5232160	are drawn to conservative politics, seemingly against their own interests.
5232160	5235160	Anyone who's interested in understanding the gender-critical movement,
5235160	5239160	a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself as feminism,
5239160	5241160	should read this book.
5241160	5242160	In Dworkin's analysis,
5255160	5259160	And conservative politics promises women meaning.
5269160	5274160	The gender-critical movement offers women a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.
5274160	5278160	A woman is an adult human female.
5278160	5282160	Right-wing anti-trans activist Posey Parker has made this phrase
5282160	5285160	into the motto of the gender-critical movement.
5285160	5288160	Adult human female.
5288160	5294160	It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts, it's on banners, signs, and tweets.
5294160	5297160	Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition,
5297160	5301160	it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.
5301160	5304160	There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines,
5304160	5306160	there can be no change.
5306160	5311160	This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability and chaos
5311160	5313160	that gender-criticals fear.
5313160	5317160	The same fear that once drove homophobic women like Anita Bryant.
5317160	5320160	Just biologically that God made mothers so that we could reproduce.
5320160	5323160	Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.
5323160	5327160	Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability
5327160	5330160	of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.
5330160	5331160	Dworkin says,
5331160	5333160	Within the frame of male domination,
5333160	5336160	there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality,
5336160	5337160	both male and female.
5337160	5340160	Women are interchangeable as sex objects.
5340160	5343160	Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.
5343160	5346160	The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.
5346160	5349160	Having children is the one social contribution credited to women.
5349160	5352160	It is the bedrock of women's social worth.
5352160	5355160	Without childbearing, women know they have nothing.
5355160	5357160	Homosexuality for women means
5357160	5359160	having nothing. It means extinction.
5359160	5362160	Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality
5362160	5365160	and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.
5365160	5369160	J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.
5369160	5373160	The woman is the producer of the large gametes.
5373160	5376160	The producer of the large gametes.
5376160	5380160	Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men
5380160	5382160	is the loss of fertility.
5382160	5385160	Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility,
5385160	5389160	attempts to socially legitimize or protect it,
5389160	5391160	makes women expendable.
5391160	5393160	The one thing women can do and be valued for
5393160	5395160	will no longer be valued.
5395160	5398160	Male homosexuality is especially terrifying
5398160	5401160	because it suggests a world without women altogether.
5401160	5403160	A world in which women are extinct.
5403160	5408160	This exact fear appears frequently in gender-critical rhetoric.
5408160	5410160	Trans activists are erasing women.
5410160	5413160	They're erasing biological sex.
5413160	5415160	They're going to call us pregnant.
5415160	5416160	Pregnant people.
5416160	5420160	Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility.
5420160	5423160	Trans women are going to replace biological women.
5423160	5426160	As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men
5426160	5428160	are aggressively replacing women.
5428160	5430160	You will not replace us!
5430160	5433160	Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession
5433160	5436160	and the results can be...dazzling.
5436160	5439160	In September 2022, Maya Forstadter,
5439160	5441160	who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist
5441160	5444160	whom J.K. Rowling came out as a TERF to defend,
5444160	5446160	went on a full-blown Twitter rampage
5446160	5449160	because the Hertfordshire County Libraries announced
5449160	5453160	they were changing their children's storytime mascot
5453160	5455160	from the Bookstart Bear
5455160	5457160	If you don't know where this is going, strap in!
5457160	5459160	from the Bookstart Bear
5459160	5463160	to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature
5463160	5465160	called Tala.
5465160	5467160	Are you enraged?
5467160	5471160	If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.
5471160	5473160	Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother
5473160	5475160	who referred to Talia
5475160	5476160	Wait, wasn't it Tala?
5476160	5481160	referring to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns,
5481160	5483160	describing the mascot as
5483160	5486160	ideological, creepy, and gaslighting.
5486160	5490160	I cannot express how upset I feel.
5490160	5493160	The library jumped in to clarify that Tala,
5493160	5494160	not Talia,
5494160	5495160	isn't trans.
5495160	5497160	They are an alien.
5497160	5500160	Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.
5500160	5502160	Did it hatch from an egg?
5502160	5504160	Or was it born from a mama?
5504160	5506160	Some people tried to reason with Maya.
5506160	5508160	There's an advantage in having a character
5508160	5510160	that isn't identifiably male or female,
5510160	5512160	as it can be equally relatable to either sex
5512160	5514160	and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.
5514160	5517160	But Maya was not convinced.
5517160	5519160	It seems highly unlikely that an alien
5519160	5523160	that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan
5523160	5525160	is not sexually reproducing.
5525160	5527160	It's a relatable anthropomorphic character,
5527160	5529160	not a slime mold.
5529160	5531160	I need to know
5531160	5533160	how the alien fucks
5533160	5535160	right now.
5535160	5536160	I said,
5536160	5537160	I need to know
5537160	5539160	how the alien fucks
5539160	5541160	before I can show it
5541160	5543160	to my child.
5546160	5550160	When Twitter understandably laughed it up at Maya's expense,
5550160	5552160	she just kept posting.
5552160	5553160	And she posted hard.
5553160	5556160	Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone post so hard.
5556160	5558160	In a lengthy diatribe,
5558160	5560160	Maya wrote about the miseries of new motherhood.
5560160	5562160	You are in charge of a baby.
5562160	5564160	You have never done this before.
5564160	5566160	You haven't had a good night's sleep for months
5566160	5567160	and won't for years.
5567160	5568160	Everyone has an opinion
5568160	5570160	on what you are doing right and wrong,
5570160	5572160	and you've become invisible.
5572160	5573160	You had politics.
5573160	5574160	You had a career.
5574160	5576160	You had interests.
5576160	5577160	You had a sex life.
5577160	5579160	Now you have the daily needs
5579160	5581160	of a completely dependent person,
5581160	5582160	and your world has shrunk.
5582160	5584160	The fact that these men
5584160	5586160	and the young women that cheer them on
5586160	5588160	think this is so laughable
5588160	5590160	reflects society's disdain.
5590160	5591160	Disdain for mothers.
5591160	5593160	This is what it means to say
5593160	5595160	a woman is not a feeling or a costume.
5595160	5597160	This is why the hub of the resistance
5597160	5599160	is on Mumsnet.
5599160	5602160	So, I am fascinated by this thread.
5602160	5604160	I think it's one of the most revealing texts
5604160	5606160	in gender-critical history.
5606160	5607160	Because you know what?
5607160	5610160	Maya Forsyter actually does
5610160	5612160	have valid concerns.
5612160	5614160	But the concerns she has that are valid
5614160	5616160	have nothing to do with trans people.
5616160	5618160	And they definitely have nothing to do
5618160	5619160	with an adorable,
5619160	5621160	adorable cartoon alien.
5621160	5623160	Honestly, reading this,
5623160	5625160	I have some concerns.
5625160	5626160	Concerns like,
5626160	5628160	where is Maya's husband?
5628160	5630160	I know she has one.
5630160	5632160	Isn't raising children supposed to be
5632160	5633160	a mutual project?
5633160	5636160	No one should have to feel this alone,
5636160	5637160	raising children.
5637160	5639160	That is a valid concern.
5639160	5641160	Oh my god, we actually found one.
5641160	5642160	It's like finding El Dorado.
5642160	5644160	A valid concern.
5644160	5646160	A valid concern.
5646160	5648160	Isn't what's going on here that Maya
5648160	5650160	is taking legitimate feelings of being
5650160	5652160	overburdened and underappreciated
5652160	5654160	and displacing those feelings onto
5654160	5655160	transgender people?
5655160	5657160	This is exactly how the gender-critical
5657160	5658160	movement recruits.
5658160	5660160	By providing a scapegoat
5660160	5662160	to frustrated women.
5662160	5664160	It's not your husband's neglect.
5664160	5666160	It's not the increasing atomization of society.
5666160	5668160	It's not the indignities of aging.
5668160	5670160	It's Tala,
5670160	5672160	the non-binary alien,
5672160	5674160	with its dungarees and
5674160	5676160	smug aura of gender neutrality.
5676160	5678160	Mumsnet is the hub!
5678160	5680160	The hub of the resistance
5680160	5682160	to non-binary cartoons.
5682160	5683160	It's too much.
5683160	5684160	These people are too much.
5684160	5685160	Okay, we have to be serious now.
5685160	5687160	The political right also promises women
5687160	5689160	safety and security.
5689160	5692160	For women, the world is a very dangerous place.
5692160	5694160	The right acknowledges the reality of danger,
5694160	5696160	the validity of fear.
5696160	5698160	The right then manipulates the fear.
5698160	5700160	Women fear and resent male violence,
5700160	5702160	which they're most likely to experience
5702160	5704160	from the men closest to them.
5704160	5707160	Boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.
5707160	5710160	They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.
5710160	5713160	But the need to survive in a male-dominated society
5713160	5716160	means that women's legitimate fears and resentments
5716160	5719160	often cannot be directed at the men with power.
5719160	5722160	Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage
5722160	5724160	and contempt they feel
5724160	5726160	for the men who actually abuse them,
5726160	5727160	those close to them,
5727160	5729160	and project it onto others.
5729160	5732160	Those far away, foreign, or different.
5732160	5734160	And this displacement of rage
5734160	5736160	is just transparently what's going on
5736160	5738160	with J.K. Rowling.
5738160	5741160	In her essay about sex and gender issues,
5741160	5744160	Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning
5744160	5747160	to be the son her father wanted.
5747160	5749160	I really felt the rejection of my father,
5749160	5751160	and that is one of the things that maybe leads
5751160	5753160	someone going into homosexuality.
5753160	5755160	And she describes the lingering trauma
5755160	5757160	from her first violent marriage.
5757160	5759160	The marriage at this point has turned very violent
5759160	5761160	and very controlling.
5761160	5765160	And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out
5765160	5767160	against the transgender movement.
5767160	5770160	If you try to understand this rationally,
5770160	5772160	it looks like a total non sequitur.
5772160	5774160	But if you look at it emotionally,
5774160	5776160	there's a kind of logic to it.
5776160	5778160	The existence of the dangerous outsider
5778160	5780160	always functions for women simultaneously
5780160	5784160	as deception, diversion, painkiller, and threat.
5784160	5786160	Women cling to irrational hatreds
5786160	5788160	focused particularly on the unfamiliar,
5788160	5790160	so that they will not murder their fathers,
5790160	5793160	husbands, sons, brothers, lovers,
5793160	5795160	the men with whom they are intimate,
5795160	5797160	those who do hurt them.
5797160	5800160	In the 1970s, many conservative women
5800160	5803160	displaced this rage onto lesbians,
5803160	5805160	the threatening outsider of the day.
5805160	5809160	Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977,
5809160	5811160	where she spoke to a lot of women
5811160	5813160	about their fear of lesbians.
5813160	5815160	Right-wing women consistently spoke to me
5815160	5818160	about lesbians as if lesbians were rapists,
5818160	5820160	certified committers of sexual assault
5820160	5821160	against women and girls.
5821160	5824160	To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous,
5824160	5827160	experienced almost as a demonic sexual force
5827160	5829160	hovering closer and closer.
5829160	5831160	She was the dangerous intruder,
5831160	5834160	encroaching, threatening by her very presence
5834160	5837160	a sexual order that cannot bear scrutiny
5837160	5839160	or withstand challenge.
5839160	5841160	It's almost surreal to read this
5841160	5843160	because of how precisely it describes
5843160	5846160	how gender criticals talk about trans women.
5846160	5848160	Pronouns are like Rohypnol.
5848160	5850160	They dull your defenses.
5850160	5852160	They change your inhibitions.
5852160	5853160	They're meant to.
5853160	5856160	Now, it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism
5856160	5861160	began as an offshoot of far-left lesbian separatism,
5861160	5865160	with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979
5865160	5868160	that transsexualism should be morally mandated
5868160	5870160	out of existence.
5870160	5873160	But the gender critical movement was always destined
5873160	5875160	to become a right-wing movement
5875160	5878160	because it has the structure of a right-wing movement.
5878160	5881160	Taking women's fear and rage toward familiar men
5881160	5885160	and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.
5885160	5888160	The momentum behind this is just too ripe an opportunity
5888160	5890160	for conservatives to pass up.
5890160	5891160	As Dworkin says,
5891160	5894160	Because women so displace their rage,
5894160	5897160	they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.
5897160	5900160	Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.
5900160	5903160	The right provides these symbols of danger
5903160	5906160	by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders
5906160	5907160	as sources of danger.
5907160	5910160	In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a trend.
5911160	5914160	A keystone of Conservative Party platforms,
5914160	5915160	both in the UK,
5915160	5916160	where Lee Anderson,
5916160	5918160	Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party,
5918160	5921160	predicts that the next election will be won on
5921160	5924160	Probably a mix of culture wars and trans debate.
5924160	5925160	and in the US,
5925160	5928160	where the ACLU is currently tracking more than
5928160	5931160	450 anti-LGBT bills,
5931160	5935160	including more than 130 gender-affirming care bans,
5935160	5937160	51 trans sports bans,
5937160	5938160	40 drag bans,
5938160	5940160	29 trans bathroom bans,
5940160	5941160	and 24
5941160	5944160	and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law.
5944160	5947160	Republicans have escalated anti-trans rhetoric
5947160	5949160	to eliminationist extremes
5949160	5952160	that have most trans people in this country
5952160	5955160	living in a constant state of fear for our future.
5955160	5958160	Transgenderism must be eradicated
5958160	5960160	from public life entirely.
5960160	5962160	The left is attacking our children,
5962160	5964160	pushing sex talk,
5964160	5966160	transgender extremism,
5966160	5968160	and noxious politics in our schools.
5968160	5970160	We should reject this demonic assault
5970160	5972160	on the innocence of our children
5972160	5974160	and stand fast against leftist efforts
5974160	5977160	to mutilate their bodies and minds.
5977160	5979160	Stop confusing our babies
5979160	5983160	with your groomer gender ideologue.
5983160	5986160	I will revoke every Biden policy
5986160	5988160	promoting the chemical castration
5988160	5991160	and sexual mutilization
5991160	5994160	of our youth,
5994160	5997160	and ask Congress to send me a bill
5997160	5999160	prohibiting child sexual mutilation
5999160	6002160	in all 50 states.
6002160	6004160	On day one, I will revoke
6004160	6006160	Joe Biden's cruel policies
6006160	6009160	on so-called gender-affirming care.
6009160	6010160	Ridiculous.
6010160	6012160	I will sign a new executive order
6012160	6014160	instructing every federal agency
6014160	6016160	to cease all programs
6016160	6018160	that promote the concept of sex
6018160	6021160	and gender transition at any age.
6021160	6023160	A few gender criticals
6023160	6024160	still want to insist
6024160	6026160	they have nothing to do
6026160	6028160	with right-wing anti-trans bigots.
6028160	6029160	Like Helen Lewis.
6029160	6031160	I mean, TERF is basically witch.
6031160	6033160	Who attempts in her interview
6033160	6035160	in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling
6035160	6037160	to distinguish between the transphobia
6037160	6038160	of the far right
6038160	6039160	and that of feminists.
6039160	6041160	I think the hardest thing
6041160	6042160	for outsiders to understand
6042160	6044160	is that there are two different arguments going on.
6044160	6047160	One is the traditional conservative right argument
6047160	6049160	which is anti-LGBT.
6049160	6051160	The other one is a criticism from the left
6051160	6053160	in which it says
6053160	6056160	sometimes male people and female people
6056160	6057160	have different interests.
6057160	6060160	No matter how the male people identify.
6060160	6061160	But as a trans person,
6061160	6062160	I don't care
6062160	6064160	whether you justify your transphobia
6064160	6066160	in the name of protecting women
6066160	6068160	or protecting children.
6068160	6070160	Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond
6070160	6072160	calling for transsexualism
6072160	6074160	to be morally mandated out of existence
6074160	6077160	or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles
6077160	6079160	calling for transgenderism
6079160	6081160	to be eradicated from public life
6081160	6083160	is the same repulsive bigotry to me.
6083160	6084160	And in any case,
6084160	6086160	the gender critical movement
6086160	6087160	has recently reached
6087160	6089160	an implicit consensus
6089160	6090160	that they're mostly done
6090160	6092160	pretending to be feminist.
6092160	6094160	The rising star of the movement
6094160	6095160	Posey Parker
6095160	6097160	aka Kelly J. Keene-Minchel
6097160	6099160	rejects feminism entirely.
6099160	6101160	Do you call yourself a feminist now?
6101160	6102160	No.
6102160	6103160	Did you ever call yourself a feminist?
6103160	6105160	I probably did for a short time.
6105160	6106160	But so you wouldn't be
6106160	6108160	like a Julie Bindel type feminist?
6108160	6109160	No, well some feminists,
6109160	6110160	I mean Julie Bindel
6110160	6113160	has been critical of mothers in the past
6113160	6115160	and I think that's a theme
6115160	6116160	flowing through feminism.
6116160	6118160	I'm not a feminist!
6118160	6119160	I'm not a feminist!
6119160	6121160	This is not Andrea Dworkin.
6121160	6123160	This is Phyllis Schlafly.
6123160	6125160	Parker's campaign is currently funded
6125160	6127160	by the right wing CPAC.
6127160	6128160	CPAC came along
6128160	6130160	and said that they would sponsor our events
6130160	6132160	and cover all of our insurance
6132160	6134160	throughout our whole trip
6134160	6136160	which is really kind of them.
6136160	6138160	But what we would need to do
6138160	6139160	is we would need to show
6139160	6141160	that we were working for them,
6141160	6142160	working with them.
6142160	6144160	She has no qualms about collaborating
6144160	6146160	with far right white nationalists.
6146160	6148160	I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.
6148160	6150160	Let me tell you what she's been saying.
6150160	6151160	She's a Republican,
6151160	6155160	but she, I agree with her wholeheartedly.
6155160	6156160	She's opposed abortion
6156160	6158160	and contraception for teenagers.
6158160	6161160	Why are we enabling children
6161160	6165160	to take sometimes contraceptives
6165160	6167160	that are quite harmful
6167160	6169160	or access to abortion?
6169160	6172160	I think that we really need
6172160	6173160	to rethink all of this.
6173160	6176160	I think parents need to take back
6176160	6177160	control of their children.
6177160	6178160	She's called trans people
6178160	6180160	fools and perverts.
6180160	6183160	Transgenderism is nuts.
6183160	6185160	It's for fools and perverts.
6185160	6187160	She's denied that transgender
6187160	6189160	is a legitimate concept.
6189160	6190160	It's not a real thing.
6190160	6191160	There's no such thing
6191160	6192160	as being born in the wrong body.
6192160	6194160	There's no such thing as a trans woman.
6194160	6196160	There's no such thing as a trans person.
6196160	6197160	There is no such thing.
6197160	6199160	There are people that call themselves
6199160	6202160	these things that may have other issues
6202160	6204160	manifesting that then make them think
6204160	6205160	they're this, but no.
6205160	6207160	We have to stop using any words
6207160	6208160	like transgender.
6208160	6210160	There may be more words
6210160	6212160	that we have to say in order to say that.
6212160	6214160	We may call it transgender ideology,
6214160	6215160	but when it comes to a person,
6215160	6218160	they may be following transgender ideology,
6218160	6219160	but they are not transgender.
6219160	6221160	There is no such thing as a man
6221160	6223160	or a woman being anything other
6223160	6224160	than a man or a woman.
6224160	6227160	She's called trans women pedophiles.
6227160	6229160	We know that if a man has a paraphilia
6229160	6231160	of dressing as a woman,
6231160	6235160	the most likely cross paraphilia is pedophilia.
6235160	6239160	We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.
6239160	6241160	They don't ever stop at one.
6241160	6243160	She's said that each and every woman
6243160	6246160	who stands in her way will be annihilated.
6246160	6248160	Each and every one of you women
6248160	6249160	who stand in my way,
6249160	6251160	each and every one of you,
6251160	6252160	let me just tell you,
6252160	6254160	you will be annihilated.
6254160	6256160	She's called on armed men
6256160	6258160	to enter women's restrooms
6258160	6260160	to attack anyone they perceive
6260160	6262160	as not a real woman.
6262160	6264160	And men, for once,
6264160	6267160	I'm talking to you.
6267160	6270160	I'm talking about you dads
6270160	6272160	who maybe carry,
6272160	6274160	I think that's what you say.
6274160	6276160	I'm so done with the American lingo.
6276160	6278160	Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.
6278160	6280160	Maybe you consider yourself
6280160	6281160	a protector of women.
6281160	6283160	Maybe you're that sort of man.
6283160	6285160	Maybe you have a daughter
6285160	6287160	or a mother or a wife.
6287160	6288160	Maybe you have a sister.
6288160	6289160	Maybe you just have some friends.
6289160	6291160	Maybe you just think women are human
6291160	6292160	and you don't need
6292160	6295160	any absolute connection with them
6295160	6298160	to feel compelled to protect us.
6298160	6301160	Um, I think you should start
6301160	6302160	using women's toilets, men.
6302160	6304160	And she's said that women
6304160	6306160	who call themselves men
6306160	6307160	should be sterilized,
6307160	6310160	which seems to be a little bit in tension
6310160	6312160	with JK Rowling's concern
6312160	6315160	about the fertility of confused girls.
6315160	6316160	You know, you might look
6316160	6318160	at these differences of opinion
6318160	6320160	between Rowling and Parker,
6320160	6322160	little things like pro-feminist
6322160	6323160	versus anti-feminist,
6323160	6325160	left versus right,
6325160	6327160	pro-abortion versus anti-abortion,
6327160	6330160	concern about trans men's fertility
6330160	6333160	versus advocating forced sterilization
6333160	6334160	of trans men,
6334160	6336160	against annihilating women
6336160	6337160	who stand in your way
6337160	6340160	versus pro-annihilating
6340160	6342160	each and every woman
6342160	6343160	who stands in your way.
6343160	6345160	You might look at these differences
6345160	6346160	and expect that these two women
6346160	6347160	would be at odds.
6347160	6349160	But they aren't.
6349160	6351160	Because promoting anti-trans bigotry
6351160	6352160	is a common cause
6352160	6354160	that for both of them,
6354160	6356160	trumps all else.
6356160	6358160	In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster
6358160	6359160	reading,
6359160	6361160	I heart JK Rowling
6361160	6362160	to be displayed at a railway station
6362160	6363160	in Edinburgh.
6363160	6365160	And Rowling has tweeted
6365160	6367160	in defense of Parker numerous times
6367160	6369160	and has modeled her t-shirts.
6369160	6372160	So, the gender-critical movement
6372160	6374160	started by lesbian separatists
6374160	6376160	in the 1970s
6376160	6378160	has finally passed into the hands
6378160	6380160	of pound shop Ava Browns,
6380160	6382160	as gender-critical lesbian Julie Bindle
6382160	6384160	memorably described them.
6384160	6386160	It's a movement that has no beliefs
6386160	6388160	apart from a shared determination
6388160	6391160	to reduce the number of trans people.
6391160	6393160	In the numbers we're currently seeing,
6393160	6395160	particularly of young people coming forward,
6395160	6397160	I find cause for doubt.
6397160	6399160	In the meantime,
6399160	6400160	while we're trying to get through
6400160	6401160	to the decision makers,
6401160	6403160	we have to try to limit the harm.
6403160	6405160	And that means reducing
6405160	6407160	or keeping down the number of people
6407160	6408160	who transition.
6408160	6410160	And that's for two reasons.
6410160	6412160	One of them is that every one of those people
6412160	6414160	is a person who's been damaged.
6414160	6416160	But the second one is every one of those people
6416160	6419160	is basically,
6419160	6422160	you know, a huge problem to a sane world.
6422160	6423160	Like, if you've got people,
6423160	6424160	whether they're transitioned,
6424160	6425160	whether they're happily transitioned,
6425160	6427160	whether they're unhappily transitioned,
6427160	6428160	whether they're detransitioned,
6428160	6430160	if you've got people who've dissociated
6430160	6432160	from their sex in some way,
6432160	6433160	every one of those people
6433160	6435160	is someone who needs special accommodation.
6435160	6437160	In a sane world where we
6437160	6439160	re-acknowledge the truth of sex.
6439160	6441160	So to wrap this up,
6441160	6443160	is the backlash against JK Rowling
6443160	6445160	a witch hunt?
6445160	6447160	Unequivocally, no.
6447160	6449160	It's very thoroughly deserved.
6449160	6451160	But I will say this.
6451160	6453160	A movement can't get along without a devil.
6453160	6456160	And across the whole political spectrum,
6456160	6458160	there's a misogynistic tendency
6458160	6460160	to choose a female devil.
6460160	6462160	Whether it's Anita Bryant,
6462160	6463160	Hillary Clinton,
6463160	6464160	Marie Antoinette,
6464160	6467160	Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,
6467160	6469160	or JK Rowling.
6469160	6470160	And there's always going to be people
6470160	6472160	who seize on any opportunity
6472160	6474160	to be misogynistic.
6474160	6476160	So, I would advise trans people
6476160	6478160	and our allies to keep in mind
6478160	6481160	that JK Rowling is not the final boss
6481160	6483160	of transphobia.
6483160	6485160	She's not our devil.
6485160	6487160	The devil is the Republican Party,
6487160	6488160	the conservative party.
6488160	6490160	The devil is patriarchy.
6490160	6492160	It's the right-wing men
6492160	6493160	who will be the ones
6493160	6495160	to put gender-critical theory
6495160	6497160	into brutal practice.
6497160	6498160	Anita Bryant,
6498160	6499160	Posey Parker,
6499160	6501160	and JK Rowling are,
6501160	6503160	to borrow a term from TERFs,
6503160	6504160	handmaidens.
6504160	6506160	TERFs are the real handmaidens.
6506160	6507160	They're useful idiots
6507160	6509160	who put a concerned female face
6509160	6511160	on the patriarchal violence
6511160	6512160	against trans people
6512160	6514160	that will ultimately be enacted
6514160	6515160	by right-wing men.
6515160	6517160	I call on men
6517160	6518160	to consider themselves
6518160	6520160	decent human beings.
6520160	6522160	To call out the deviance among them
6522160	6524160	and eradicate these monsters
6524160	6526160	from society.
6526160	6528160	And Megan Phillips Roper
6528160	6529160	and centrists like her
6529160	6532160	are wrong that civil conversation
6532160	6534160	can resolve this.
6534160	6536160	To call out the deviance among them
6536160	6538160	and eradicate these monsters
6538160	6540160	from society.
6540160	6542160	People like Michael Knowles
6542160	6543160	and Ron DeSantis
6543160	6544160	and Donald Trump
6544160	6546160	cannot be persuaded.
6546160	6548160	They have to be defeated.
6548160	6550160	As for what to do about JK Rowling,
6550160	6551160	honestly,
6551160	6553160	let's all just block her.
6553160	6555160	Open up Twitter right now,
6555160	6556160	go to her profile
6556160	6557160	and just block her.
6557160	6558160	Problem solved.
6558160	6560160	Like, don't harass her,
6560160	6561160	that doesn't help.
6561160	6562160	But also,
6562160	6563160	I wouldn't wait for her to change.
6563160	6565160	She's gone down what I call
6565160	6566160	the bigotry whirlpool.
6566160	6567160	The deeper you go in,
6567160	6569160	the harder it is to leave.
6569160	6570160	For the same reasons
6570160	6572160	that it's hard to quit a cult or scam.
6572160	6574160	To quote video essayist Dan Olson,
6574160	6576160	One of the most insidious elements
6576160	6577160	of a confidence scam
6577160	6578160	is that the victims
6578160	6580160	who invested the most
6580160	6582160	are often the most passionate defenders.
6582160	6583160	Because shame
6583160	6584160	is a powerful force
6584160	6585160	in the human psyche
6585160	6587160	and they can't bear the shame
6587160	6589160	of admitting they were tricked.
6589160	6590160	Reformed bigots have to face
6590160	6591160	not only the shame
6591160	6592160	of being dupes,
6592160	6593160	but also the guilt
6593160	6595160	of having devoted years of life
6595160	6597160	to harming vulnerable people.
6597160	6598160	This is something Megan,
6598160	6599160	to her credit,
6599160	6600160	faced head on.
6600160	6601160	If we were wrong,
6601160	6602160	then I had spent
6602160	6603160	every day of my life
6603160	6605160	industriously sowing doom,
6605160	6606160	discord,
6606160	6607160	and rage
6607160	6608160	to so many
6608160	6609160	not at the behest of God,
6609160	6610160	but of others.
6610160	6611160	Not at the behest
6611160	6612160	of my grandfather.
6612160	6613160	I had wasted my life
6613160	6614160	only to fill others
6614160	6615160	with pain and misery.
6615160	6617160	Most bigots cannot stand
6617160	6619160	to face this moral sunk cost.
6619160	6621160	It's why an obsessive bigot
6621160	6622160	like Graham Linehan,
6622160	6623160	whose all-consuming hatred
6623160	6624160	of trans people
6624160	6625160	has ruined his life,
6625160	6626160	cost him his marriage,
6626160	6628160	and left him alone
6628160	6629160	to tweet about destroying
6629160	6630160	gender ideology
6630160	6631160	minutes before midnight
6631160	6632160	on New Year's Eve,
6632160	6634160	feels psychologically compelled
6634160	6636160	to insist with ever more certainty
6636160	6637160	that trans people
6637160	6638160	are not just delusional
6638160	6639160	or dangerous,
6639160	6640160	but are all
6640160	6642160	demonic perverts,
6642160	6644160	an enemy so hyperbolically evil
6644160	6645160	that they justify
6645160	6647160	his self-immolating crusade.
6647160	6650160	They took everything from me,
6650160	6651160	you know.
6651160	6654160	They took my family,
6654160	6655160	you know.
6655160	6656160	And I just said,
6656160	6657160	no, hang on a sec.
6657160	6659160	Stop calling these women TERFs.
6659160	6662160	Stop sending them abuse.
6662160	6663160	Let them speak.
6663160	6665160	And for that,
6665160	6667160	they just destroyed me.
6667160	6668160	Do you honestly feel destroyed?
6668160	6670160	No, because,
6670160	6671160	because the one thing about this,
6671160	6672160	the one thing about this
6672160	6673160	that keeps me going
6673160	6675160	is that I know I'm right,
6675160	6676160	you know.
6676160	6677160	I know I'm right.
6677160	6678160	As long as he stays here,
6678160	6680160	in the bottom of the whirlpool,
6680160	6681160	he never has to face
6681160	6683160	that he's ruined his relationships
6683160	6684160	and wasted years of life
6684160	6687160	because he just couldn't let it go.
6687160	6688160	And if JK Rowling
6688160	6689160	doesn't log off soon,
6689160	6692160	this will likely be her fate as well.
6693160	6695160	I guess what I'm really trying to say is,
6695160	6697160	Harry Potter's dead to me.
6697160	6699160	I'm switching to Twilight.
6727160	6729160	And there's authors
6729160	6730160	that are bound to say
6730160	6731160	that wizardry is a good thing
6731160	6733160	but neither is warned.
6733160	6734160	And they say,
6734160	6735160	well,
6735160	6736160	you and I
6736160	6736760	can
6736760	6737160	think about
6737160	6738160	some other story
6738160	6739160	you can put a bit
6739160	6740160	more perspective.
6740160	6741540	Anything willка
6743160	6744160	please let these characters
6744160	6745160	have their own story.
6745160	6746160	Because it all depends
6746160	6747160	on Jesus.
6747160	6747720	Especially what one
6747720	6748160	of the characters
6748160	6749160	would ever say when
6749160	6750160	they first come here.
6750160	6751160	said that she was
6751160	6752160	on the line
6752160	6753160	and byr.
6753160	6754160	His daughter.
6754160	6755160	spelled out
6755160	6756160	it's one of the reasons
6756160	6757160	Jim Crow doesn't roll over,
6757160	6787140	Thank you.
6787160	6817140	Thank you.
6817160	6847140	Thank you.
6847160	6877140	Thank you.
6877160	6903180	At least it's a fruit pie.
