0	15180	All right, so what are we looking at? What new hell have we sunk to now here in the United States?
15180	18740	They ask you how you are and you just have to say that you're fine. You're not really fine,
18840	21140	but you just can't get into it because they would never understand.
21200	26980	Well, it's a Kentucky police patrol car with a Blue Lives Matter thin blue line
26980	34400	Punisher skull on the hood. Um, there's a lot to unpack here, but let's stick to tradition and
34400	39440	begin by examining the skull. The skull is the symbol of the Punisher, the Marvel Comics
39440	44360	vigilante antihero. The Punisher's real name is Frank Castiglione, but he changed it to Frank
44360	49140	Castle, I guess because he's ashamed of his Sicilian heritage. Disappointing. Frank Castle
49140	53840	is an ex-Marine whose wife and kids are murdered by the mob, leaving him an empty husk of a man
53840	56540	whose only consolation is his obsession with revenge.
56980	61200	There's been a lot of TV and movie adaptations of the Punisher, and as research for this video,
61300	66960	I did watch all of them, and my conclusion is that the best one is the 1989 version where
66960	71680	Dolph Lundgren dyes his hair black to pass as Sicilian and runs around naked and sweaty in
71680	78480	the sewers, worshiping the god of vengeance at a shrine of trash. You know, just like the police do.
78480	86900	Number 60. Hi, I am Natalie, creator of Catra Points. And no, I'm not a cat girl. I'm a cat
86900	86960	woman. I'm a cat woman. I'm a cat woman. I'm a cat woman. I'm a cat woman. I'm a cat woman.
86960	91720	I'm sorry you're intimidated by that. Look, I'm tired of only being valued for my petite
91720	98960	heterosexual body. I'd like to be recognized for my worth as a mother, as a wife, and
98960	107800	as a woman with values. Just kidding, I'm trash. Let's talk about justice,
107940	111680	Ulu. Justice is when I get lots of head pats.
112180	116420	The Punisher's main quest is to kill all the mobsters who murdered his family,
116420	121260	but once he gets revenge, he can't stop killing, because it's the only thing that gives meaning to
121260	126960	his shitty life. So he wages a one-man war on organized crime. But no matter how many bad guys
126960	132460	he kills, it's never enough, because new criminals just come along and take the place of the old
132460	138300	ones. It's like a cycle, where violence begets violence, and nothing ever really changes.
138800	143280	It's almost like this comic book is trying to tell us something about the nature of crime
143280	146060	and punishment. But you know what? Let's not overthink this.
146060	150100	Sure, just slap a giant skull on the car. Great. Perfect.
150560	151580	Are we the baddies?
151700	156540	Look, maybe you're assuming I'm one of these lip-tarded, Antifa-sympathizing,
157020	162280	big government anarchists who sits behind my iPhone with my latte,
162780	167420	criticizing the police, even though I could never do a job one-tenth as difficult as theirs.
167660	171980	And to that I say, how dare you assume things that are entirely correct?
171980	175540	This is, excuse me, a damn fine cup of coffee.
176060	179520	There's nothing better than waking up in the morning and having the first dose of the
179520	182820	chemical you're addicted to. They tried to make me go to rehab. I said,
183440	191880	Like, you seem like a reasonable person, a person of science, a seasoned vendor at the
191880	196380	free marketplace of Ideas Gorge. And as a reasonable person, I'm sure you wouldn't
196380	199860	dismiss my argument just because I happen to enjoy headpats.
199860	205220	As Socrates once said, two plus two is four is equally true, whether uttered by a philosopher
205220	205860	king or a...
206060	207060	peasant knave.
207060	208060	Or a neko mimi.
208060	211060	Kawaii days!
211060	213060	Is this problematic?
213060	219460	Cringe culture is dead and we have killed it. This is beyond cringe. This is cursed, children! Cursed!
219460	224580	So actually, Socrates didn't say this quote, I just made it up, but that just proves the point I'm making,
224580	227140	so maybe you should hear me out, meow.
227140	231700	I'm making this video at a time when hundreds of videos of police brutality are being shared on
231700	235780	social media, spurring on a movement to abolish police and prisons.
236060	241040	But at the same time, there's a growing culture of online vigilantism, where justice is taken
241040	246380	into the hands of Twitter mobs demanding accountability and consequences for bad behavior.
246380	251260	All of this raises a lot of questions. Questions like, what should the consequences be for
251260	256660	bad behavior? Who should impose these consequences? And under what circumstances? And for what
256660	261060	purpose? If we were to abolish police and prisons, what would take their place?
261060	265060	Oh my god, these contacts. I'm literally doing a whole video with fucking sideways cat eyes. Ridiculous.
265060	270460	Why don't we start with the basics, and ask ourselves, what is Justice Socrates?
270460	275340	It's a question philosophers have pondered for thousands of years, with no conclusive answers.
277660	282540	I think I can probably figure this out in a YouTube video. Because the philosophers were dummies.
282540	285180	And I am very smart, meow.
285180	289020	Ra-Ra-Rasputin 1. Revenge
289020	294940	The Punisher represents a particular idea about what justice is, symbolized by the skull he
294940	300260	wears on his t-shirt, so that bad guys know they're about to get punished.
300260	305900	The Punisher's view is that justice means harming people who harm people. An eye for an eye.
305900	311380	This is called retributive justice, the idea that people who commit crimes deserve punishment
311380	312660	in proportion to their crime.
312660	318700	It's a very emotionally powerful idea of what justice is, because it's rooted in our instinct
318700	323620	to strike back at someone who's harmed us. Social animals, like humans and chimpanzees,
323620	324740	often practice revenge.
324940	328080	probably because it serves an evolutionary function.
328080	331160	If another monkey in your monkey troop steals your bananas
331160	332540	and you don't get revenge,
332540	335420	then other monkeys will learn that you're a doormat monkey.
335420	338880	But if you get revenge on the thief monkey by,
338880	339720	I don't know,
339720	342460	letting her boyfriend pick parasites out of your fur,
342460	345180	then that sends a message to the other monkeys
345180	348100	that it is not profitable to mess with you.
348100	349740	So our little monkey brains
349740	351820	have evolved a taste for vengeance.
351820	354580	And even in cases where it doesn't actually benefit us,
354580	357120	our desire for retribution is strong
357120	359460	and our little monkey brains reward us
359460	361760	with a pleasant feeling of catharsis
361760	364500	when justice of this kind is served.
364500	367500	So of course, there's a lot of content out there
367500	369540	devoted to scratching this itch.
369540	373680	For example, there's a subreddit called r slash justice served
373680	375880	with one and a half million subscribers.
375880	377380	I first found justice served
377380	379720	when the popular feed showed me this post
379720	382380	of two teenage thieves stripped naked,
382380	384500	humiliated and photographed
384500	386860	as punishment and all this celebrated
386860	389460	under the heading police justice.
389460	392580	In fact, before the murder of George Floyd by police,
392580	394600	the description of the community was
394600	397400	now with 20% more police brutality.
397400	401220	Um, fun fact, this ain't it chief.
401220	403180	Period, full stop.
403180	404620	That's the tweet.
404620	406680	Of course, I subscribed to justice served right away
406680	410080	thinking someone should be keeping an eye on these people.
410080	412180	Here's a typical justice served post.
412180	414080	Woman sets P-E-D-O,
414500	418660	husband on a fire after catching him R-A-P-E,
418660	420300	seven year old daughter,
420300	423740	titled this man got what he deserved.
423740	425540	Instant regret.
425540	427440	Predator exposed.
427440	429180	To be honest, when I wrote this part of the script,
429180	430980	I forgot I was gonna be wearing cat ears.
430980	432600	I'm really out here trying to have a conversation
432600	434140	about immolating sex offenders
434140	438320	while dressed like a aging bargain bin,
438320	440880	Belle Delphine impersonator.
440880	443440	Well, dress for the job you want.
443440	443900	I mean, whom's to, amongst us,
443900	446480	wouldn't set their husband on fire
446480	448360	under those circumstances, right?
448360	450500	Let's look at the comments on that post though.
450500	452140	Let's read the room.
452140	454080	She's a hero, in my opinion.
454080	456200	Should have had it live on television.
456200	457460	Give her a medal.
457460	458880	Give her two medals.
458880	461700	So most people are in favor of setting predators ablaze,
461700	464560	but you know, there's always a couple buzz kills in there,
464560	466500	whining as usual about,
466500	470080	oh, maybe we shouldn't be cheering on burning people alive
470080	472180	with no due process and no evidence.
472180	473100	Lots of men like to fuck my wife.
473100	473900	Lots of men like to fuck my wife.
473900	476380	Because I'm too busy crying about due process.
476380	478620	But those people get shouted down pretty fast.
478620	480280	They get called pedo simps.
481380	482380	Pedo simp.
482380	484520	So justice served as a community
484520	486300	for people to gather together
486300	489920	and bond over our shared love of extrajudicial violence.
489920	491980	But of course, there's always someone
491980	494020	who takes it a little too far.
494020	496460	On this video of a thief being kicked in the head
496460	498380	until his face is a bloody pulp,
498380	499800	one commenter says,
499800	502380	that's a justice boner for me.
502380	503740	I dream of the day I catch the police.
503740	505920	I dream of the day I catch the thieves that stole from me
505920	508680	and kick the life out of them.
508680	510120	Criminal fail.
510120	511720	Prank gone wrong.
511720	514740	So when the righteous zeal for justice
514740	517080	becomes the cloak of bloodlust,
518140	520500	that is off-putting to some people.
520500	523760	As one disgruntled former Justice Serve subscriber put it,
523760	525720	I wanted to see stories and videos
525720	527980	of assholes getting their comeuppance.
527980	531240	Instead, I got bombarded with an angry,
531240	533220	toxic moral absolutism.
533220	535100	Everything is black and white with them.
535100	538260	If you don't support mutilating someone beyond repair,
538260	540920	then you must support giving them a slap on the wrist
540920	542600	and letting them fuck your wife.
542600	544000	Unsubscribed.
544000	547540	But even this liberal cuckold still wanted to watch
547540	550260	videos of assholes getting their comeuppance.
550260	553060	I think pretty much everyone is capable of enjoying
553060	555920	some version of this type of content.
555920	557340	There's a lot of subgenres.
557340	558980	You've got justice porn,
558980	561280	play stupid games win stupid prizes,
561280	562640	instant karma,
562640	564300	bad parking revenge,
564300	565500	predator poaching,
565500	566860	What did you just shoot me?
566860	568780	serial killer sentenced to death
568780	570320	and the whole train clapped,
570320	572880	instant justice was served,
572880	574080	karma fails,
574080	576640	stupid people getting what they deserved.
576640	577480	Karma.
577480	580980	A lot of this content has kind of a right-wing feel to it.
580980	582880	Unmarked police justice.
582880	585440	Criminal gets shot after fighting cop.
585440	589240	Home invader takes shotgun blast to the balls.
589240	591360	Arizona.
591360	592260	Just Arizona.
592640	593620	What more is there to say?
593620	594460	Arizona.
594460	595620	Justice served.
595620	596520	Punished.
596520	599580	It reminds me of NRA people who spend 10 hours a day
599580	602100	fantasizing about how they're gonna kill home intruders
602100	603820	with the gun they keep in the bathroom.
603820	605940	But I don't think this longing for retribution
605940	607740	is distinctively right-wing.
607740	611320	Left-wing people have the exact same emotional response,
611320	613440	they just have it in different situations.
613440	615760	Think about the jubilation on Twitter
615760	618080	when they get a racist Karen fired.
618080	620860	Remember that ugly hag Lisa who harassed a black man
620860	622080	in front of an apartment building?
622080	623900	Karma.
623900	626420	And she got her husband fired.
626420	628540	Dumb bitch really should have minded her business.
628540	629800	Love to see it.
629800	633860	She will probably end up with community service and a fine.
633860	636100	But I would love to see her in jail
636100	638200	for at least six months.
638200	640200	Firing them was not enough.
640200	643440	Life in prison.
643440	646580	Life in prison.
646580	649160	An example I personally enjoy is that video
649160	651900	of Daniel Holtzclaw, the cop who abused his power,
651900	654440	to sexually assault a series of black women,
654440	656300	crying in court as he's sentenced
656300	658820	to serve 263 years in prison.
661420	663120	He just cannot believe that he's actually
663120	664740	facing consequences for this.
664740	668220	And of course, there's the much-savored vigilante punching
668220	671380	of NAZI, Richard Spencer.
671380	673480	Let's watch it now.
673480	674840	Please try not to enjoy this.
674840	677780	Remember, this is purely for educational,
677780	679420	monetizable purposes.
680620	681720	It's Pepe's, because...
681720	682960	Has it become kind of a symbol?
685280	686680	That was informative.
686680	690480	But let's be honest, the reason that video was so popular
690480	695480	is people just enjoyed watching an NAZI get what he deserves.
697380	698920	Justice served.
698920	699860	Punished.
699860	700900	Smashing.
700900	703480	Very happy day sounds, boo-boo.
703480	706220	Remember to smash subscribe.
706220	709160	So this punitive, retributive impulse,
709160	709240	no matter how righteous it feels, is still there.
709240	711280	So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels,
711280	712220	is still there.
712220	712580	So this punitive, retributive impulse, no matter how righteous it feels, is still there.
712580	715620	It's still there, but it's still a situationally form of sadism,
715620	717080	of schadenfreude.
717080	719360	The satisfaction of justice served
719360	723200	is the pleasure we take in inflicting or witnessing
723200	726360	the suffering of someone who deserves it.
726360	728780	Now, the phrase, deserves it,
728780	730740	is doing a lot of work here.
730740	732200	The correct use of that phrase
732200	735400	is the difference between a morally well-adjusted person
735400	738000	and someone who's hiding bodies in the crawlspace.
738000	739940	It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah.
739940	739960	It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah.
739960	740120	It puts the lotion on its skin, yeah.
740120	747340	But people generally agree that those who harm others deserve to be harmed themselves.
747340	750300	It's why we love stories about revenge.
750300	756680	Stories like Mean Girls, The Crow, Oldboy, Titus Andronicus, and Matilda.
756680	760680	Much too good for children.
760680	765120	Revenge is such a popular plotline because it's easy for people to identify with a
765120	770620	revenge-seeking protagonist, and it's just the easiest way to hype people up about spectacles
770620	771720	of violence.
771720	776000	This technique was used in one of the first books ever, The Odyssey by Homer.
776000	778000	I stole this copy from my high school.
778000	780000	And I stole this copy from my college.
780000	781500	I still just read the Sparknotes.
781500	782700	Well, let's read it now.
782700	785240	See, I knew this would be useful someday.
785240	788300	God, he's such a fuckboy.
788300	789900	What does Athena see in this man?
789900	791360	It must be really hot.
791360	793460	Okay, I'm ready for my book report.
793460	795080	So the hero of the story is Odysseus.
795080	802740	And the whole book is him trying to get home to the island of Ithaca after, um, okay, so
802740	809020	in the prequel, Odysseus' shitty friend Menelaus throws a tantrum after his wife leaves him
809020	811480	to run off with a Turkish guy she was actually attracted to.
811480	812480	How dare she?
812480	818120	So Menelaus dragged an entire nation to war instead of doing what any normal man would
818120	821200	do and blowing off some steam at Femboy's symposium.
821200	825060	Anyway, when Odysseus finally gets back to Ithaca, he finds that his house is now a
825060	830040	place full of men who are eating his food and drinking his wine and trying to marry
830040	831040	his wife.
831040	835960	So Odysseus, and this is the hero of our story here, he murders all of his wife's suitors
835960	837280	as payback.
837280	842980	And then he rounds up all the slave women who slept with the suitors and he has them
842980	843980	all hanged.
843980	849540	And this one suitor, Melanthius, Odysseus ties him up and cuts off his ears and nose
849540	854720	and feet and then rips off his genitals to feed to the dogs.
854720	859980	Reading this, I guess I find myself asking, uh, was this really necessary?
859980	864440	Like as a test reader, my feedback for Homer is, maybe workshop this?
864440	866920	I mean, super unlikable protagonist.
866920	867920	Really kind of kills it for me.
867920	872100	I guess it's a male protagonist and you can get away with making them unlikable because
872100	873760	men love hearing about assholes.
873760	875480	That's why they watch my channel.
875480	879920	But the crazy thing is, I don't think Odysseus is supposed to be an asshole.
879920	884700	The text seems to approve of what he does to the suitors and to his, uh, men.
884720	886380	His slaves.
886380	887380	Yikes.
887380	888380	Disappointing.
888380	891480	Casual reminder that Odysseus kills his slaves.
891480	893040	It isn't a good look.
893040	894040	Wow, this blew up.
894040	895760	I don't have a sound cloud.
895760	896760	Give me money.
896760	899600	Oh my god, this contact is fully horizontal.
899600	901900	This is the last time we're doing cat eye contacts.
901900	902900	Fuck this.
902900	904160	It just seems disproportionate, you know?
904160	907640	Like it's not even eye for an eye because the suitors didn't kill anyone.
907640	910640	They were basically just rude to Odysseus.
910640	913840	But I guess you have to understand this kind of thing in cultural context.
913840	918840	They came into his home, and they disrespected his wife, and probably she was into it, but
918840	920180	whatever, we'll play along.
920180	922700	So that was an affront to Odysseus's honor.
922700	928420	And on the island of Ithaca in the year 1000 BC or whatever, honor was everything.
928420	930880	Because this was a pre-legal society.
930880	931880	No laws.
931880	932880	No courts.
932880	933880	No cops.
933880	934880	School's out.
934880	936220	Fuck 12.
936220	940040	So honor is a code of conduct enforced by reputation.
940040	943500	And that's what kept people from stealing and lying and murdering each other.
943500	947160	Though it was also often the thing causing them to murder each other.
947160	950820	Because back then, honor was the only thing protecting people from being taken advantage
950820	951820	of.
951820	955260	If you're an ancient Mycenaean king, and someone invites themselves into your house
955260	960340	and drinks your wine and seduces your wife, well you can't let them get away with that.
960340	962280	Because then people will walk all over you.
962280	966960	So you need to get revenge to protect your honor, to maintain your reputation as a person
966960	968380	who is not to be messed with.
968380	972120	It's also the point of hard masculinity in honor cultures.
972120	973400	Hard masculinity is a defense.
973400	976840	It's a defensive posture, an intimidating posture.
976840	980260	It showcases strength and hides vulnerability.
980260	985900	We call it toxic masculinity now, because in our society, it's destructive and dysfunctional.
985900	989160	We've moved beyond the need for this, which is why it's possible for me to exist.
989160	993940	If society collapses and we go back to Achilles and Odysseus, I'm in danger.
993940	996800	I'm much too delicate for this Mycenaean savagery.
996800	1001720	Back in Homer's time, I'd be, well, I'd be a slave at Femboy's symposium.
1001720	1002720	Extremely sad gay sounds.
1002720	1003720	Meow.
1003720	1009020	But for people in situations where appealing to community or state law enforcement is not
1009020	1014840	an option, such as kings of ancient Mediterranean islands, or gangsters who need to resolve
1014840	1021180	conflicts outside of the law, or wild west cowboys, hard masculinity has a function.
1021180	1026420	It's a warning signal, like a skull t-shirt, or the stripes on a poisonous snake.
1026420	1029160	And the poison is vengeance.
1029160	1030160	Justice served.
1030160	1031720	So, revenge is arguably the most basic form of revenge.
1031720	1032720	It's the most basic form of revenge.
1032720	1034780	It's the most basic form of retributive justice.
1034780	1039960	The philosopher Francis Bacon defined revenge as a wild justice, according to the first
1039960	1042720	paragraph of the Wikipedia article about revenge.
1042720	1043720	Research.
1043720	1045480	I am very smart, meow.
1045480	1050820	But in most modern legal systems, revenge is frowned upon, and for pretty good reasons.
1050820	1054640	An eye for an eye will make the whole world blind, didn't you know that?
1054640	1059480	If someone harms you, and you get revenge by killing him, then his family is gonna try
1059480	1060720	to get revenge by killing you.
1060720	1061720	It's a cycle.
1061720	1064220	A cycle of smashing.
1064220	1068720	At the end of the Odyssey, the families of the suitors Odysseus killed band together and
1068720	1071320	plot to get revenge by killing Odysseus.
1071320	1075360	And literally the last thing that happens in the Odyssey is that the goddess Athena,
1075360	1081520	who has an inexplicable ladyboner for Odysseus, steps in and saves him by… just… making
1081520	1084760	the families forget that Odysseus killed their children.
1084760	1088720	So only divine intervention and amnesia stops the cycle of violence.
1088720	1091720	But in reality, that doesn't happen very much.
1091720	1094720	So these cycles can last for decades or even centuries.
1094720	1099540	In Albania, there's an ancient code called the Canon, which requires a family to commit
1099540	1103620	murder in order to preserve their honor when another family offends against them.
1103620	1105640	Life for life, blood for blood.
1105640	1110420	This historically led to blood feuds between families that could last for generations,
1110420	1113720	and in fact it still sometimes happens in parts of northern Albania.
1113720	1118320	There's documentaries on YouTube about families who are trapped at home, possibly for the
1118320	1120720	rest of their lives, because there's a vendetta against them.
1120720	1121720	And if they leave, they're dead.
1121720	1123720	If they leave the house, they'll be murdered.
1123720	1128660	Historically, blood feuds led to a high mortality rate for young men, which may have contributed
1128660	1132520	to the tradition of what are called Albanian sworn virgins.
1132520	1136380	These are assigned female at birth people who would take a vow of chastity in exchange
1136380	1138060	for getting to live as men.
1138060	1141980	There's still some of them around, and in a very patriarchal society they're socially
1141980	1146520	recognized as men, allowed to wear men's clothes, use a male name uwu, act as head
1146520	1150920	of a household, inherit family wealth, and generally have the rights and privileges of
1150920	1151520	a man.
1151720	1153980	They're extremely happy trans sounds uwu.
1153980	1158220	I bring this up just because I think it shows how devastating the blood feuds must have
1158220	1162720	been, because only desperation would lead a European country hundreds of years ago to
1162720	1164320	support trans rights.
1164320	1166960	No one wants that, so you know it was a last resort.
1166960	1170720	Um, sworn virgins weren't transgender, most were compelled to revenge in the family.
1170720	1173900	Yeah, I know that, Sweaty, it was just a joke, okay, calm down.
1173900	1178720	Revenge cycles also happen on a larger scale, between communities, nations, ethnicities,
1178720	1179720	and religions.
1179720	1180720	I'm worried if I give a real example.
1180720	1185720	I'll be canceled for seeming neutral about a conflict where I'm supposed to take a
1185720	1186720	side.
1186720	1193720	So, in the interest of cowardice, let's say that the cat girls bombed the dog girls,
1193720	1198720	and then the dog girls bombed the cat girls, and that cycle repeats for a few decades,
1198720	1203420	and by that point, both nations have such a long and bitter list of grievances against
1203420	1206720	each other that reconciliation is close to impossible.
1206720	1209920	Extremely angry gay sounds, nyah.
1209920	1213920	So a revenge-based code of honor is not really an ideal justice system.
1213920	1218200	It's bloody, it's chaotic, and it produces these endless cycles of violence.
1218200	1222940	So at some point in the growth of a civilization, something has to be done to control the chaos
1222940	1223940	caused by vengeance.
1223940	1228920	And the most popular way to do that is to create a state legal system.
1228920	1229920	2.
1229920	1232760	Retribution The extremely heckin' cute and valid German
1232760	1239320	sociologist Max Weber defined the state as the organization with a monopoly on the legitimate
1239320	1239920	use of violence.
1239920	1245560	In an honor society with no rule of law, anyone is allowed to kill someone as long
1245560	1248080	as they do so in accordance with the code of honor.
1248080	1252360	But once you have the state, usually only the government is allowed to kill people.
1252360	1256520	In ancient Babylon, there was a king called Hammurabi who enacted one of the first law
1256520	1263700	codes in the world around 1750 BC, an era that scholars refer to as history times.
1263700	1265920	The code of Hammurabi looked like this.
1265920	1268920	The laws were crudely scratched into the stone using some...
1268920	1269920	...
1269920	1271920	...primitive attempt at writing.
1271920	1275920	I mean, it was like a thousand years ago, so I'm sure they were doing their best.
1275920	1277920	It's very good, sweetie.
1277920	1279920	I'll hang it up on the refrigerator for you.
1279920	1281920	I was expecting this replica to be bigger.
1281920	1285920	Sort of a Spinal Tap Stonehenge situation.
1285920	1291420	The actual Hammurabi steles were about seven feet tall, and they were publicly placed in
1291420	1295920	the city so that everyone knew what the laws were, even though most people were illiterate.
1295920	1297920	But hey, they tried, sort of.
1297920	1298920	Let's read some of Hammurabi's laws.
1298920	1299920	That's content, right?
1299920	1302920	Cat girl reacts to the code of Hammurabi.
1302920	1306920	Nyas queen.
1306920	1308920	We don't deserve rights.
1308920	1313920	So there's 282 laws, and they're all in if-then form, so if you do X, then the punishment
1313920	1314920	is Y.
1314920	1319920	Law 22, if anyone is committing a robbery and is caught, then he shall be put to death.
1319920	1320920	That's extremely valid.
1320920	1325920	If a son of a paramour or prostitute say to his adoptive father or mother, you are not
1325920	1326920	my father or my mother, his tongue shall be cut off.
1326920	1327920	That's extremely valid.
1327920	1328920	His tongue shall be cut off.
1328920	1330920	At least they're standing up for adoptive parents.
1330920	1335920	If a man put out the eye of another man, his eye shall be put out.
1335920	1337920	Now we're getting into some of the classics.
1337920	1340920	If he break another man's bone, his bone shall be broken.
1340920	1346920	If a freedman strike the body of another freedman, he shall pay ten shekels in money.
1346920	1352920	But if the slave of a freedman strike the body of a freedman, his ear shall be cut off.
1352920	1355920	Oh, so there's different punishments for different classes.
1355920	1357920	So it's like our legal system except honest.
1357920	1362520	If a builder build a house for someone and does not construct it properly, and the house
1362520	1366920	which he built fall in and kill its owner, then that builder shall be put to death.
1366920	1371920	If it kill the son of the owner, the son of that builder shall be put to death.
1371920	1372920	Love that.
1372920	1377920	Okay, so by modern standards, the Code of Hammurabi does not pass the vibe check.
1377920	1379920	The vibrations are very negative.
1379920	1382920	It's a lot of cutting people's hands off and burning them alive.
1382920	1383920	Just a major vibe killer all around.
1383920	1384920	But you have to credit Hammurabi.
1384920	1389920	But you have to credit Hammurabi's Code for resolving the problem of honor-driven revenge cycles.
1389920	1394320	You know, if you live in Babylon and someone harms you, instead of retaliating against
1394320	1399960	their family and potentially starting a generations-long blood feud, you take your grievance to the
1399960	1404580	elders of the city, who reach a verdict and impose a sentence, justice served.
1404580	1408840	So the involvement of a neutral third party is one major difference between vigilante
1408840	1412520	revenge and a state legal system of retributive justice.
1412520	1414360	Let's list all the differences.
1414360	1418180	Revenge is personal, in the sense that it's the victim who does the avenging.
1418180	1420720	It's often emotional, an act of passion.
1420720	1425960	It can be disproportionate, as in Odysseus killing the suitors for squatting in his palace.
1425960	1427280	And it's sadistic.
1427280	1429460	It's satisfying to the avenger.
1429460	1430460	Revenge is sweet.
1430460	1435100	On the other hand, a legal system of retributive justice is impersonal, in the sense that the
1435100	1439140	punishment is imposed by a third party, the state, and not the victim.
1439140	1444240	It's therefore disinterested, so not in theory motivated by emotion, and also lacking the
1444240	1446320	sadism of sweet revenge.
1446320	1449360	It's also proportionate, again in theory.
1449360	1453860	You know, an eye for an eye sounds brutal, but it's an eye for an eye and no more than
1453860	1458860	an eye, and that could be considered humane compared to, say, revenge killing someone's
1458860	1460180	family for an eye.
1460180	1464800	And it's also consistent, so different offenders are supposed to get the same punishment for
1464800	1465800	the same crime.
1465800	1469360	I mean, unless you're rich, in which case, don't you even worry your little head about
1469360	1470560	it, just pay some gold.
1470560	1471560	It's fine.
1471560	1472560	Girl, these contacts?
1472560	1473560	Like…
1474240	1479860	So there are supposed to be these differences between revenge and retributive justice, which
1479860	1485060	is why it's so inappropriate for law enforcement to identify with the outlaw punisher.
1485060	1490860	Modern criminal sentencing accepts retribution as a goal, while rejecting revenge as lawless.
1490860	1498500	However, I feel that retributive justice is still spiritually akin to revenge.
1498500	1503020	It scratches the same emotional itch, it's basically revenge by proxy.
1503020	1504020	If revenge is wild, then it's revenge by proxy.
1504020	1505100	If there's injustice, then just don't even bother with that.
1505100	1508760	If there's injustice, then retributive justice is domesticated revenge.
1508760	1513740	In both cases, there's a drive to restore the moral order of things, to balance out
1513740	1519840	the karma by harming the person who caused harm, sometimes in a poetic justice kind of
1519840	1520840	way.
1520840	1525320	Like in The Code of Hammurabi, there's this symbolic retaliation of punishing the
1525320	1527740	body part that you've offended with.
1527740	1531620	Cutting off the hand that struck the father, cutting off the breast of the wet nurse who
1531620	1533140	switched the babies.
1533140	1533960	Cutting out the tongue that struck the father, cutting off the breast of the wet nurse who switched the babies.
1534020	1540180	renounced its parents. There's a kind of aesthetic dimension to this, an appreciation for the symmetry
1540180	1545780	of punishment and crime. For a modern example, here's a poetic justice post from r slash instant
1545780	1551700	karma. Mugshots.com puts people's mugshots online and then demands payment to take them down. The
1551700	1556660	site's founders were just arrested for extortion. Here are their mugshots. There's something
1556660	1563220	metaphysically pleasant about poetic justice, this sense of beautiful cosmic harmony. And my guess is
1563220	1568180	that this way of thinking originates in some primeval human instinct that's difficult to get
1568180	1573940	rid of. But that doesn't mean we shouldn't question it. The logic of retribution has been questioned
1573940	1581860	for thousands of years by philosophers, reformists, messiahs, you know, fancy people who think they're
1581860	1587220	too good to enjoy violence. One school of anti-retribution thought we could call the
1587220	1593060	love and forgiveness school. And the main love and forgiveness guy is a preachy lib you may have
1593060	1593200	heard of. I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's a school of anti-retribution thought.
1593200	1593600	I don't know if you've heard of it, but it's a school of anti-retribution thought.
1593600	1599520	Called Jesus of Nazareth. Back in Bible times, the Hebrews had laws of retributive justice that were
1599520	1604960	similar to the Code of Hammurabi. Like in the Book of Exodus, God gives a bunch of laws to Moses,
1604960	1610640	including some relaunches of Hammurabi classics. Viewers at home may now open up your Bibles to
1610640	1616560	Exodus 21-22. If people are fighting and hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely,
1616560	1621040	but there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever the woman's husband
1621040	1623040	demands and the court allows. But if there is no serious injury, the offender must be fined whatever
1623040	1625200	the woman's husband demands and the court allows. But if there is serious injury, you are to take
1625200	1632160	life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for
1632160	1639600	wound, bruise for bruise, head pats for head pats. Welcome to Catgirl Bible Study, Neil. Extremely
1639600	1646080	devotional gay sound, Zulu. I feel very spiritually aroused right now. My third eye chakra? Dripping.
1646080	1652880	Macaroni in a pot. I need Jesus. I'm so sorry. So the law of Moses is pretty
1652880	1660400	based and uncucked. It's basically an eye for an eye, don't be a homo, you know, basic common sense.
1660400	1665360	But then Jesus comes along and he's riding his high horse of love and forgiveness. In Matthew
1665360	1673280	26-52, a disciple tries to defend Jesus from being arrested after Judas betrays him, but Jesus says,
1673280	1678240	Put your sword back in its place, Spartacus. All who draw the sword will die by the sword.
1678240	1682720	Now some people read that as saying that violence begets violence and should be renounced.
1682720	1687200	Even to the point where you shouldn't defend yourself, which is peak radical centrism.
1687200	1693120	Denying the right of marginalized people to defend themselves? Rethink this. It gets worse.
1693120	1699200	In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you.
1699200	1706400	Love your enemies? But I don't want to love my enemies. No loving. Smashing. But maybe Jesus wasn't
1706400	1711840	as literal-minded as that. You know, religion is a very subjective thing, and I have my own Bible
1712720	1720560	versions, and my personal view is that a lot of what Jesus says is actually sarcasm.
1720560	1726080	Like, consider Matthew 5-38. Why is no one talking about Matthew 5-38? Jesus says,
1726080	1730800	You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I say to you,
1730800	1735920	Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also.
1736480	1742320	Think of the drama of what he's asking you to do here. Someone strikes you across the face and you
1742720	1751120	say, Ugh. This is not pacifism. This is passive aggression. Some sort of primeval Hebrew shade.
1751120	1759440	This is the Christianity of, Okay, well, I'll pray for you. But if you do take Jesus at face value,
1759440	1764800	then I would argue that his endorsement of love and forgiveness as a response to wrongdoing
1764800	1772400	is not justice at all. It's an alternative to justice. In the absence of justice, forgiveness,
1772720	1779600	is an emotional unburdening of the resentment and anger that victims of injustice experience.
1779600	1784720	And religion often provides this release, instructing people not to worry too much about
1784720	1790320	serving earthly justice, because justice is really God's business, and he'll take care of that when
1790320	1795520	the day of judgment comes. It's a little bit like in Hinduism and Buddhism, there's the idea of
1795520	1802160	karma, which is like a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or
1802160	1802720	human instinct. It's like a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human instinct.
1802720	1803600	It's like a cosmic law of moral cause and effect that exists independently of any God or human instinct.
1803600	1808800	You reap what you sow, basically, so maybe don't worry about injustice too much, because
1809360	1814400	karma will take care of it. This kind of thinking is sometimes called the just world fallacy,
1814400	1819520	the cognitive bias that sees the world as inherently fair and good. Everything happens
1819520	1825120	for a reason. If something really horrible happens, like a child is murdered, people say,
1825120	1829360	there's a special place in God's kingdom for little angels taken up so soon.
1829360	1832160	And then they'll fantasize about the killer going to hell and being
1832160	1837520	anally demolished by fire demons or whatever. People reassure themselves like this because it
1837520	1843760	relieves the stress of enduring unresolved injustice. In the Bible, the book of Job
1843760	1849680	deals with the problem of injustice. Why do bad things happen to good people? And the answer is,
1849680	1854720	just don't worry about it. It's part of God's plan. It'll all work out in the end. It's fine.
1854720	1860480	Everything's fine. The alternative is being burdened with the awareness that the world is just kind of
1860480	1866560	very not good. In which case, you might start getting ideas in your head about,
1867360	1869440	I don't know, maybe changing some things.
1869440	1873600	I guess I should disclaimer that hashtag not all religion, and obviously many political
1873600	1878480	activists have been influenced by faith, but let's put a pin in that for now.
1878480	1880640	3. Utilitarianism
1880640	1884880	So there's also a secular tradition of anti-retribution thinking,
1884880	1890400	which tries to define justice as something other than retaliation. Utilitarian
1890480	1896080	reformists have argued that the goal of criminal justice should be to improve society,
1896080	1901040	rather than punishment for punishment's sake. Utilitarianism is the moral theory which says
1901040	1906160	that the right thing to do is whatever causes the highest ratio of human happiness to human
1906160	1911200	suffering. So the utilitarian approach to punishment looks forward at preventing future
1911200	1916560	crimes, where retribution looks backward at punishing past crimes, revenge by proxy.
1916560	1919920	Some utilitarian punishment goals might be deterrence,
1919920	1920400	punishment for crimes, and punishment for crimes. Some utilitarian punishment goals might be,
1920400	1926080	criminals as an incentive for others not to offend, or incapacitation of criminals in prisons,
1926080	1931600	or rehabilitation of criminals, trying to educate or discipline them so that they can reenter society.
1931600	1936240	A lot of people consider these utilitarian goals to be more rational and scientific than
1936240	1942720	retribution, which is very based in emotions. Also, the utilitarian idea of justice makes sense,
1942720	1947200	even if you don't believe in free will. Because retribution really only makes sense if you
1947200	1949840	believe that people freely choose their actions,
1949840	1954880	and are therefore culpable for their behavior, and can be deserving of punishment.
1954880	1959680	Because punishing someone for something they didn't meaningfully choose seems, well...
1959680	1965440	The Greek historian Herodotus tells a story about the Persian king Xerxes ordering the sea to be
1965440	1971360	whipped with 300 lashes after a storm destroyed his bridge. Which seems irrational, right?
1971360	1973120	To punish a force of nature?
1973120	1975280	Leave my beautiful wet wife alone!
1975280	1979280	It's debatable how free humans are, like we're at least partially product,
1979280	1986000	but we're actually products of our genetics, our environment, our upbringing, our Hogwarts house,
1986000	1990880	the placement of Venus in our natal chart, dry, oilier combination.
1990880	1994800	And modern criminal sentencing tries to take all of that into consideration.
1994800	1998880	Like you might get a lighter sentence if you argue that, you know, your mother never took
1998880	2003920	you to Disneyland, it was a crime of passion, through no fault of my own I was high on bath
2003920	2008400	salts at the time of the tax evasion, your honor. A lot of the language around punishment in our
2008400	2009200	legal system is utilitarian.
2009280	2014880	Like, prisons are called correctional facilities, not retribution cages.
2014880	2018480	But correctional facilities is a euphemism, because the fact is,
2019120	2022800	these facilities are not doing very much correcting. I'm sorry.
2022800	2027520	In the United States, two-thirds of released prisoners are re-arrested within three years,
2027520	2031120	and 76% are re-arrested within five years.
2031120	2034240	And just think about the way we talk about incarceration.
2034240	2037200	Like if someone really evil gets a long sentence, we say,
2037200	2039120	Good! I hope he rots in prison!
2039280	2043280	Like, when was the last time you heard about a criminal sentencing and someone said,
2043280	2048400	Good! The proven efficacy of our correctional facilities will rehabilitate this man and
2048400	2051040	release him a contributing member of his community.
2051040	2056240	So even the institutions we have that are supposed to serve a correctional or rehabilitative function
2056240	2059760	are still obviously satisfying our urge to punish.
2059760	2063760	I think the problem with utilitarianism is that, while it's very rational,
2064400	2067840	it's often offensive to human emotions.
2067840	2069120	And you can say facts don't care about you.
2069120	2074400	We shouldn't be basing our legal system on whatever sadistic caprice passes through your mind.
2074960	2076080	And I agree with you.
2076080	2081040	But the fact remains, if someone hurts your child, you don't want to rehabilitate him.
2081040	2082560	You want to set him on fire.
2082560	2087680	And this disconnect between the legal system and human emotion affects law enforcement too.
2087680	2092480	A YouTuber called Jose has a video called Why Some Cops Think They're the Punisher,
2092480	2096000	which argues that some cops and soldiers admire the Punisher
2096000	2098640	because they relate to his military background while
2099120	2103040	criticizing about the moral simplicity of his vigilantism.
2103040	2107200	Jose quotes from interviews with military Punisher fans who say things like,
2107200	2112160	Castle doesn't see shades of grey, which, unfortunately, the American justice system
2112160	2116000	is littered with and which tends to slow down and sometimes even hinder
2116000	2118960	victims of crime from getting the justice they deserve.
2118960	2122960	Frank Castle is the ultimate definition of Occam's razor for the military.
2122960	2126960	Don't worry about uniforms, inspections, or restrictive rules of engagement.
2126960	2128000	Find the bad guys.
2128000	2128960	Kill the bad guys.
2128960	2130560	Protect the innocent.
2130560	2131840	Any true warrior?
2131840	2132960	That's the dream.
2132960	2138640	So these cops and soldiers feel cramped by rules of engagement and use of force restrictions
2138640	2142080	that are keeping them from serving swift and brutal justice.
2142080	2147600	You know, law enforcement would be a lot easier if it weren't for all these pesky laws.
2147600	2152320	There's a childish simplicity and dualism to this moral worldview.
2152320	2153680	Find the bad guys.
2153680	2155040	Kill the bad guys.
2155040	2158640	Again, it reminds me of the NRA rhetoric about how you need a good
2158640	2162160	guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun.
2162160	2164880	There's only 8 year old boys playing cops and robbers.
2164880	2169420	Good guys and bad guys.
2169420	2172080	That's my impression of an 8 year old boy.
2172080	2175780	And to be fair, I totally understand the appeal of moral simplicity.
2175780	2179760	People love justice-served and instant karma videos for a reason.
2179760	2184460	We take satisfaction in swift, decisive, elegant retribution.
2184460	2188240	But the procedures of law enforcement and criminal justice don't allow us.
2188240	2193200	allow for that. There's all these tedious roadblocks. Right to an attorney. Right to remain
2193200	2198080	silent. Right to a fair trial. Presumption of innocence. A lot of police wish they could
2198080	2202720	simplify things by being judge, jury, and executioner. But the function of police is
2202720	2207760	supposed to be limited to making arrests and initiating criminal investigations. They're not
2207760	2213680	supposed to be walking avatars of karma dispensing free-form retribution in the streets at will,
2213680	2219040	justice served, now with 20% more police brutality. But a lot of people defend the police
2219040	2224080	when they behave like this, because the thin-wristed civilians are just as emotionally
2224080	2229040	frustrated by due process as the cops. Wow, did I just say all lives are bastards?
2229760	2234480	I'm double cancelled. Well look, all lives are bastards. But only some bastards are armed by
2234480	2238880	the state and licensed to go bastarding around town. The rest of us have to be
2238880	2243520	bastards on our off time. I also think there's a secular version of the just world fallacy
2243680	2248720	going on here. People like to think that if the police kill somebody, it must be because
2248720	2254880	that person did something wrong. Karma at work, justice served. Victim-blaming is an expression
2254880	2260560	of the just world fallacy. You get what you deserve, so if something bad happens to you,
2260560	2264720	you must have been asking for it. And obviously racism is a huge part of this. You know,
2264720	2269280	there's structural white supremacy that occupies black neighborhoods with police instead of
2269280	2273600	investing in communities. And people are prejudiced and more likely to think of black people as
2273600	2273660	people with disabilities. And I think that's a huge part of this. You know, there's structural white supremacy that occupies black neighborhoods with police instead of investing in communities. And people are prejudiced and more likely to think of black people as
2273660	2278940	criminal thugs and therefore deserving of police violence. So we get this no angel discourse that
2278940	2283340	comes up every time a black person is murdered by the police, where they bring up the victim's
2283340	2288300	criminal record or a picture of them looking like a scary thug, as if that proves they deserved to
2288300	2294540	die. The problem with this, of course, is that no one is an angel. There are no angels walking
2294540	2299340	this earth. We're all flawed. We've all made mistakes. We've all done bad things. That doesn't
2299340	2303580	mean we deserve to die a violent death. And then there's people like Breonna Taylor
2303580	2308300	and Elijah McClain, who, as far as we know, were about as close to angels as humans come,
2308300	2313900	but that didn't protect them. So that is 100% beside the point, because black people in America
2313900	2318540	should not literally have to have white feather wings and glowing halos to deserve not to be
2318540	2323260	murdered by the police. In fact, people of all races have the absolute right to be low-life,
2323260	2328300	drug-addicted, petty criminals who contribute absolutely nothing to society and yet still not be
2328300	2333260	executed by the cops because that's what it's supposed to mean to live in a free country. So,
2333260	2337500	things need to change. The Punisher police have got to go, and a lot of the rest of our justice
2337500	2343180	system with them. We need to imagine a whole new approach to justice and, to be honest, that might
2343180	2346780	take more than one YouTube video. I know at the beginning I said I was going to explain what
2346780	2356860	justice is, but um, I lied. I'm sorry that I can't fix America. I'm just a lonely cat. I guess the
2356860	2363100	only solution is revolution. And by revolution I do mean to vote Democrat and then bully the Democrats into
2363100	2368300	actually doing something. And if they don't listen, well...
2371020	2371980	Hang on, let me get this.
2375420	2378460	Moshi moshi! Hey, how are you, Jace?
