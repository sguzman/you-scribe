00:00.000 --> 00:05.680
If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you do.

00:05.680 --> 00:11.360
You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with toad venom,

00:11.360 --> 00:15.920
and you simply wait for the wolverines to eat your legs.

00:17.040 --> 00:21.200
Trust me, you're better off that way. Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race,

00:21.200 --> 00:25.280
well, here's what you get. You get fascism, racist pseudoscience,

00:25.280 --> 00:30.960
racist debate fascists, tag team title match tonight at 9, or if you're lucky, you get this.

00:30.960 --> 00:35.200
So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy-nilly convicting innocent black people of

00:35.200 --> 00:39.840
crimes they didn't commit. Perhaps individuals who happen to be black are making bad choices

00:39.840 --> 00:44.480
for which they have to deal with the consequences. Racism isn't the explanation for everything bad

00:44.480 --> 00:47.680
that happens to black people. If blacks are getting shot and going to jail more,

00:47.680 --> 00:51.680
it's their fault for committing crimes. That's right. Racial inequality in America

00:51.680 --> 00:55.200
exists because black people simply decide to commit more crimes for

00:55.200 --> 00:55.260
now. That's right. Racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide to commit more crimes for now.

00:55.260 --> 01:00.320
I guess he's probably going to blame the rap music. Or deadbeat dads with their sagging pants.

01:00.320 --> 01:04.120
I'd say that this is the most common right-wing view of race in America. It's not outright

01:04.120 --> 01:09.080
fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that racial inequality is the product

01:09.080 --> 01:14.760
not of injustice, but of… black people simply deciding to make bad choices. Usually this idea

01:14.760 --> 01:18.840
gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial inequality and

01:18.840 --> 01:21.880
dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.

01:21.880 --> 01:25.180
Mmm, they make me uncomfortable and I don't like it. This is what I'm going to

01:25.180 --> 01:29.260
argue against in this video. We're going to take a break from talking about fascism. In the past,

01:29.260 --> 01:33.740
I've focused too much on the alt-right. I think we all have. I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely

01:33.740 --> 01:37.900
is a dangerous movement, but it's just not the most consequential kind of white supremacy that

01:37.900 --> 01:42.140
exists in America. In this video, I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America,

01:42.140 --> 01:45.260
which is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.

01:45.260 --> 01:49.660
And from now on, I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow of Pepes and

01:49.660 --> 01:55.100
racist Odinists and neo-Nazi LARPers. All that stuff, it's very last season. I'm kind of

01:55.100 --> 02:00.620
over it. Oh, God damn it. Hello, people. Fritz, get the hell out of here. No one cares about you

02:00.620 --> 02:06.860
anymore. Nein, ich heiße nicht mehr Fritz. Nenn mich jetzt Freya. What? Ich bin jetzt eine Frau.

02:06.860 --> 02:12.220
Great. Get out. Well, don't you want to hear about my transition? No, I don't care. No one cares.

02:12.220 --> 02:17.420
You're still a Nazi. Get out. But I'm trans. How could I possibly be a Nazi? That's a good

02:17.420 --> 02:21.500
question. It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense.

02:21.500 --> 02:25.020
Get out. She calls me a Nazi, and yet she's the one trying to silence

02:25.100 --> 02:30.220
my free speech, an excellent example of how truly fascist the left has become. Look,

02:30.220 --> 02:33.900
if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny, why aren't you willing to discuss them in the free

02:33.900 --> 02:37.740
marketplace of ideas? Well, I'm going to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as

02:37.740 --> 02:42.300
you get out of my room. Mom, get out of my life. Well, can we at least talk about the Jewish

02:42.300 --> 02:47.500
question? No. It's just ideas. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the

02:47.500 --> 02:51.900
tabby whistle if you don't get out of here in ten seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. Oh,

02:51.900 --> 02:54.780
baby, come on. I thought you liked to bake. You used to whisper in my ear. I'm afraid that I'm

02:54.780 --> 02:58.540
going to have to whisper it to me so sweetly. Well, not anymore. Well, do you at least want

02:58.540 --> 03:07.900
to buy some Vitalimax? Hey, Jesus. I don't like doing this. I prefer to have conversations about

03:07.900 --> 03:12.380
disagreements. I don't enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat, but it's these people,

03:12.380 --> 03:17.020
they just give you no choice. Where were we? Right, so racial injustice. When I talk to people

03:17.020 --> 03:21.820
about this issue, they often claim to have this experience that leftists react to them in two ways.

03:21.820 --> 03:26.620
One, by saying, you're racist. And two, by saying, it's not my job to educate you. And I'm

03:26.620 --> 03:30.700
sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience a lot

03:30.700 --> 03:34.460
of people have. And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this,

03:34.460 --> 03:39.740
no offense. And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are

03:39.740 --> 03:45.660
more than happy to educate people in their own special way. So as I see it, the left needs to

03:45.660 --> 03:49.820
step it up. Now, to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on Twitter to demand they

03:49.820 --> 03:50.920
explain racism to you, you're being called a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're

03:50.920 --> 03:51.020
a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're

03:51.020 --> 03:52.060
a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're being kind of

03:52.060 --> 03:56.460
an asshole. And it's true. It's not their job to explain it to you. They have other shit to do

03:56.460 --> 04:01.340
with their lives. But I, on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out

04:01.340 --> 04:05.980
of my lane and white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes. Because it kind of is my job,

04:05.980 --> 04:10.460
and I have all the time in the world. It's a funny thing, time.

04:11.580 --> 04:16.620
Whose job is it to mend the crimes of history? Do we have to take responsibility for things

04:16.620 --> 04:20.120
that happened a long time ago? I don't even take responsibility for things I didn't do.

04:20.120 --> 04:27.860
July. This person. Who the fuck is that? No, I don't have any white guilt. That's not what this

04:27.860 --> 04:32.260
is about. That's just more white narcissism is what that is. So wipe away those white-ass tears.

04:32.260 --> 04:34.660
Here. I'll pick you out a cotton ball.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.020
1. Freddie Gray

04:47.020 --> 04:50.100
On April 12, 2015, three police officers,

04:50.100 --> 04:55.160
near a housing project in West Baltimore, arrested a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray

04:55.160 --> 05:00.160
because he was carrying a spring-assisted knife that maybe was illegal? They handcuffed him and

05:00.160 --> 05:04.520
loaded him into a police van. His leg broke and y'all dragging him like that.

05:04.520 --> 05:08.840
When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason, with three

05:08.840 --> 05:14.240
fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck. A week later, Gray died of his spinal

05:14.240 --> 05:18.040
injury while the Baltimore police released contradictory and inadequate information about

05:18.040 --> 05:19.280
his arrest. This led to widespread protests, and the police were forced to arrest him. This led to

05:19.280 --> 05:20.080
widespread protests, and the police were forced to arrest him. This led to widespread protests,

05:20.080 --> 05:23.760
all over the city, eventually culminating in the notorious Baltimore riots.

05:23.760 --> 05:27.440
Now you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism? If black people don't want to be

05:27.440 --> 05:31.440
killed, then they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from the police. Well, the first problem with

05:31.440 --> 05:36.240
that is that extrajudicial executions for non-violent crimes shouldn't really be a common

05:36.240 --> 05:40.720
thing in a civilized democracy. And it's a little alarming to me how quick you are to defend this.

05:40.720 --> 05:44.640
And the other problem is that that's a very superficial analysis that refuses to examine

05:44.640 --> 05:49.520
the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more poverty, more crime, and are subject to

05:49.520 --> 05:49.600
more aggressive violence than black neighborhoods. And the other problem is that that's a very

05:49.600 --> 05:50.080
superficial analysis that refuses to examine the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more

05:50.080 --> 05:54.080
of policing. So let's delve a little deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.640
Gray had a long arrest record of mostly drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators

05:58.640 --> 06:04.560
brought this out as evidence that he was no angel. The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got

06:04.560 --> 06:08.800
what was coming to him, that he deserved to die. But why did he commit all these crimes in the

06:08.800 --> 06:13.840
first place? I don't think he was selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition. Did he just

06:13.840 --> 06:19.600
do it for no reason? Well, let's see. Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood,

06:19.600 --> 06:23.440
Sandtown, Winchester. You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in

06:23.440 --> 06:28.480
a dilapidated row house with peeling lead paint. Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint

06:28.480 --> 06:33.680
until Congress banned it in 1978 because it causes serious cognitive damage in children,

06:33.680 --> 06:38.000
leading to deficits in attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned

06:38.000 --> 06:42.880
with lead are seven times more likely to drop out of school, and six times more likely to end up in

06:42.880 --> 06:47.920
the juvenile justice system. But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with

06:47.920 --> 06:49.040
the Congressional ban on lead paint. And that's not the only reason why Freddie Gray has been

06:49.040 --> 06:53.520
banned from using lead paint. And as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been

06:53.520 --> 06:58.160
added to Maryland's lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children are black.

06:58.160 --> 07:02.960
Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent brain

07:02.960 --> 07:07.520
damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids. Now, you might be thinking, well, reparations were

07:07.520 --> 07:13.360
paid out, so problem solved, right? Well, unfortunately, no. What's happened is a sub-industry

07:13.360 --> 07:18.000
has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead poisoning victims, some of whom can't even

07:19.040 --> 07:22.880
believe it, and offer to buy out their structured monthly settlements in exchange for a lump sum

07:22.880 --> 07:26.400
that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement. And that's exactly what happened

07:26.400 --> 07:33.040
to Freddie Gray. In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his

07:33.040 --> 07:40.560
settlement for $18,300. They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000

07:40.560 --> 07:46.800
Gray siblings settlement for $54,000. Now, I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad,

07:46.800 --> 07:49.020
but to understand how it relates to structural racism, I'm going to give you a little bit of a

07:49.020 --> 07:54.060
look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation. Or, you know, we could just keep doing livestreams

07:54.060 --> 07:59.260
with Richard Spencer. Interviews with Nazis. The new YouTube craze. God damn it. I need to relax.

07:59.260 --> 08:00.060
I need music.

08:06.860 --> 08:08.700
2. Housing Discrimination

08:08.700 --> 08:12.940
Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated lead

08:12.940 --> 08:18.140
levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.

08:18.140 --> 08:19.000
Yellow dots stand out.

08:19.020 --> 08:19.980
Standing for black residents.

08:19.980 --> 08:21.340
And blue dots standing for white.

08:21.900 --> 08:23.180
Lead. Race.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.340
Lead. Race.

08:25.340 --> 08:29.100
Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.

08:29.100 --> 08:32.460
Why, in the 21st century, is Baltimore still so segregated?

08:32.460 --> 08:34.780
I thought racism was over.

08:34.780 --> 08:39.900
Well, here's the thing about that. When your country's history is 400 years of slavery,

08:39.900 --> 08:43.260
Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't just get to say,

08:43.260 --> 08:46.540
Oops. Sorry about that.

08:46.540 --> 08:48.540
It's all cool now though, right?

08:48.540 --> 08:48.940
No.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.220
It's not cool.

08:50.220 --> 08:54.060
And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not cool things.

08:54.060 --> 08:56.460
Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place.

08:56.460 --> 08:59.980
I hope I'm not being too controversial if I propose that, 100 years ago,

09:00.700 --> 09:02.940
America may have been somewhat racist.

09:02.940 --> 09:08.460
In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious

09:08.460 --> 09:12.780
white Baltimore neighborhood. This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city

09:12.780 --> 09:17.980
passed an ordinance mandating the segregation of every residential block. Basically, the ordinance

09:17.980 --> 09:22.700
forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks, and vice versa,

09:22.700 --> 09:26.060
until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.

09:26.060 --> 09:29.260
Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem?

09:29.260 --> 09:32.700
Racism can't exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.

09:32.700 --> 09:34.220
Well, no.

09:34.220 --> 09:35.980
That's actually not correct.

09:35.980 --> 09:40.540
In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote homeownership in the

09:40.540 --> 09:43.340
midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed.

09:43.340 --> 09:47.820
One of the FHA's purposes was to establish a reliable credit system backed by the government,

09:47.820 --> 09:50.860
which would regulate interest rates and ensure the terms of mortgages.

09:50.860 --> 09:54.940
FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating homeownership throughout the

09:54.940 --> 09:58.860
middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now remember as the golden

09:58.860 --> 10:02.780
age of the American Dream. But many black Americans were excluded from homeownership

10:02.780 --> 10:07.340
and the benefits it conferred to white families, particularly the family financial stability it

10:07.340 --> 10:12.460
enabled. So how was this exclusion possible? Well, basically, the FHA, city governments,

10:12.460 --> 10:17.180
and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle methods to enforce residential segregation and

10:17.180 --> 10:19.980
deny homeownership to black Americans. For instance,

10:19.980 --> 10:21.740
1. Restrictive covenants

10:21.740 --> 10:25.740
When the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official

10:25.740 --> 10:30.140
Committee on Segregation, which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure

10:30.140 --> 10:34.060
landlords in white neighborhoods to sign covenants committing them never to sell or

10:34.060 --> 10:38.220
rent to black residents. These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health

10:38.220 --> 10:42.620
code citations issued against owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the

10:42.620 --> 10:43.260
covenant.

10:43.260 --> 10:44.540
2. Redlining

10:44.540 --> 10:47.020
The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to

10:47.020 --> 10:51.100
insure mortgages in black neighborhoods, which were colored in red on official maps,

10:51.100 --> 10:55.660
giving the practice the name redlining. This effectively denied black citizens access to

10:55.660 --> 10:59.180
government-backed mortgages, which, in turn, left them vulnerable to

10:59.180 --> 11:00.860
3. Predatory lending

11:00.860 --> 11:05.820
Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed mortgages,

11:05.820 --> 11:09.580
exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly-priced installment plans with

11:09.580 --> 11:14.220
abusive terms, which allowed, for instance, sellers to repossess and resell homes after

11:14.220 --> 11:17.020
a single missed payment. Many black residents had no choice,

11:17.020 --> 11:21.180
but to buy into these exploitative contracts, and they often resorted to subdividing houses

11:21.180 --> 11:25.260
or neglecting repairs in order to make payments, further contributing to the overcrowding and

11:25.260 --> 11:26.780
decay of black neighborhoods.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.300
4. Blockbusting

11:28.300 --> 11:31.980
Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting,

11:31.980 --> 11:36.220
where they'd intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among residents of

11:36.220 --> 11:40.620
a white neighborhood. They would then exploit the fear that they created to trick white homeowners

11:40.620 --> 11:45.180
into selling their houses at below market prices, so they could resell those same houses at

11:45.180 --> 11:46.860
extortionate prices to black families. The FHA used this scheme to avoid the risk of black

11:46.860 --> 11:50.620
families desperate to escape the ghetto. The long-term effect of these practices was that

11:50.620 --> 11:54.700
many black families ended up trapped in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools,

11:54.700 --> 11:59.580
little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty, and aggressive, discriminatory policing.

11:59.580 --> 12:02.380
And even though most of these segregation practices have ended,

12:02.380 --> 12:07.020
the injustice remains unredressed. No reparations have been paid to black families who were

12:07.020 --> 12:11.100
effectively robbed of homeownership during this period, predatory lending having cost

12:11.100 --> 12:16.780
black families an estimated $500 million in Chicago alone. But worst of all is that segregation

12:16.860 --> 12:21.100
and ghettoization caused by government-backed discrimination of the last century is still

12:21.100 --> 12:26.460
ongoing. I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fucking neighborhood like one mile away from

12:26.460 --> 12:30.140
where Freddie Gray was arrested in a neighborhood that's like a whole different country.

12:30.140 --> 12:36.380
Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore. Now compare that to the 2013 population by race map.

12:36.380 --> 12:41.500
If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is, and if the city still follows the same

12:41.500 --> 12:46.780
pattern of segregation today, and it does, well, it's almost as if the effects of

12:46.780 --> 12:51.900
racism have not entirely been eradicated. And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.

12:51.900 --> 12:57.580
Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans,

12:57.580 --> 13:01.740
Cleveland, LA. All these cities are still segregated as shit, and it's not like a

13:01.740 --> 13:06.860
separate but equal situation either. Compare the 2013 population by race map of Baltimore

13:06.860 --> 13:11.660
to this map of Baltimore police stops between 2010 and 2015. That's black neighborhoods in red

13:11.660 --> 13:16.060
and green dots representing recorded police stops of black pedestrians. And finally, let's bring

13:16.060 --> 13:21.260
back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013. Now consider this information in

13:21.260 --> 13:26.060
combination with some scientific studies linking lead exposure and violent crime, and it almost

13:26.060 --> 13:30.620
starts to look like there's some problems going on here that might not be solved simply by telling

13:30.620 --> 13:34.940
black teenagers to tighten their belts and do less crimes. But I don't want to overstate the lead

13:34.940 --> 13:39.020
crime theory either, because that only accounts for a small fraction of what's going on here.

13:39.020 --> 13:43.020
The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation,

13:43.020 --> 13:45.980
the historical exclusion from homeownership, the lost upper

13:46.060 --> 13:50.700
opportunities, the bad schools, and this country's ongoing insistence on treating a problem of

13:50.700 --> 13:54.780
injustice as if it were simply a problem of criminality. I know I said my interest in this

13:54.780 --> 14:00.460
topic isn't a matter of white guilt, and it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?

14:02.380 --> 14:08.300
In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt. You're not

14:08.300 --> 14:14.460
responsible for what your great-grandparents did. As you ease the tension in each muscle group,

14:14.460 --> 14:16.060
exhale deeply, and repeat,

14:16.060 --> 14:20.060
the mantra, black lives matter are the real racists.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.700
3. Mass Incarceration

14:24.700 --> 14:29.980
Since the 1970s, the United States' incarceration rate has rapidly risen to the point where nearly

14:29.980 --> 14:35.020
1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison. We now have the highest incarceration rate in the

14:35.020 --> 14:40.540
world, accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's

14:40.540 --> 14:44.620
population. More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black, and the black

14:44.620 --> 14:45.500
incarceration rate is almost 2.5% of the world's population. This is the highest incarceration rate

14:45.500 --> 14:45.580
in the world, accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's

14:45.580 --> 14:46.300
prisoners, though we make up only 4.5% of the world's prisoners. This is the highest incarceration rate

14:46.300 --> 14:47.340
in the world's prison rate.

14:47.340 --> 14:51.660
Now, without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in general.

14:51.660 --> 14:56.060
Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison, too many defendants are

14:56.060 --> 15:00.140
pressured into plea bargains, and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of

15:00.140 --> 15:04.300
incarceration. But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.

15:04.300 --> 15:07.180
Now, a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,

15:07.180 --> 15:10.220
if the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.

15:10.220 --> 15:12.140
Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.340
You know what, why don't we all interview Richard Spencer? Every single YouTuber,

15:15.340 --> 15:19.580
free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda. Let's get them

15:19.580 --> 15:24.300
all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream, and then we can finally give the

15:24.300 --> 15:28.620
Jewish question the platform it deserves. God damn it, where's my toad venom?

15:28.620 --> 15:32.140
Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit

15:32.140 --> 15:36.300
more crimes. For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate, but black people

15:36.300 --> 15:40.380
are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it. And we're talking about a drug that,

15:40.380 --> 15:45.260
at this point, white America has basically decided shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.

15:45.340 --> 15:49.820
So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry, and just look what white people are

15:49.820 --> 15:56.620
doing to weed. Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a ganjapreneur. It's a strong, strong sativa,

15:56.620 --> 16:01.100
very high in limonene. It's a great bronchodilator, so I like to use it when I work out.

16:01.100 --> 16:04.220
Yeah, so, in fact, in the back of the limousine is only the,

16:04.220 --> 16:06.540
one of the only legal places you can consume cannabis.

16:07.260 --> 16:11.340
The whites are at it again. They have gentrified the marijuana. And now we've got white business

16:11.340 --> 16:15.180
people making millions of dollars selling the same drug that black people are still

16:15.180 --> 16:17.660
disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.

16:17.660 --> 16:18.780
A ganjapreneur!

16:18.780 --> 16:20.460
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

16:20.460 --> 16:25.180
This is the most basic kind of unfairness. And if this doesn't make you angry, then either you're

16:25.180 --> 16:30.620
really ignorant about this, or you might just not care about black people.

16:30.620 --> 16:34.700
I don't like to assume the worst of people, but when I look at the state of the conversation about

16:34.700 --> 16:39.820
race in America, I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial

16:39.820 --> 16:43.740
executions of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,

16:43.740 --> 16:47.180
and the vicious history of discrimination and its ongoing repercussions.

16:47.180 --> 16:51.980
And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person who

16:51.980 --> 16:55.580
takes a stand, or takes a knee, or speaks up about this in any way.

16:55.580 --> 17:00.380
There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter is,

17:00.380 --> 17:03.900
and how it's identity politics equivalent to white nationalism,

17:03.900 --> 17:07.020
and it's unpatriotic, and postmodern, and racist.

17:07.020 --> 17:10.300
And I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.

17:10.300 --> 17:13.660
Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's night

17:13.660 --> 17:17.180
mare. If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare,

17:17.180 --> 17:20.300
it's locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.

17:20.300 --> 17:23.740
But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to

17:23.740 --> 17:29.340
talk about that. They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.300
How dare they?

17:30.300 --> 17:35.020
Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists or stock

17:35.020 --> 17:39.100
salad-eating basic white girl caricatures. I imagine some black people will probably watch

17:39.100 --> 17:42.860
this video and think, where does this white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim? I take

17:42.860 --> 17:46.380
responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.

17:46.380 --> 17:50.300
And here's the thing about that. You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility,

17:50.300 --> 17:53.420
or taking control of your life to the greatest extent possible,

17:53.420 --> 17:56.140
is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.

17:56.140 --> 17:59.260
So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.

17:59.260 --> 18:01.660
Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.

18:01.660 --> 18:05.660
So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallowing victimhood.

18:05.660 --> 18:08.380
Please don't do that. Go succeed as much as possible.

18:08.380 --> 18:12.380
But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.

18:12.380 --> 18:16.220
Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances,

18:16.220 --> 18:20.300
but we also have a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions

18:20.300 --> 18:22.620
that create those circumstances in the first place.

18:23.660 --> 18:26.540
Wow. I feel like I just gave a great speech.

18:26.540 --> 18:30.220
Would you take my speech less seriously if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light

18:30.220 --> 18:32.460
Lime this entire time? Look, I even put a lime in it.

18:32.460 --> 18:36.620
Bud Light Lime with Lime. The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain

18:36.620 --> 18:42.140
too much about people who complain too much about racism. For the final countdown.

18:42.140 --> 18:44.620
I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.

18:44.620 --> 18:48.780
First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white people.

18:48.780 --> 18:52.060
I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.

18:52.060 --> 18:54.460
But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country,

18:54.460 --> 18:56.380
and someone should make videos about those too.

18:56.380 --> 18:59.020
Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.

18:59.020 --> 19:02.860
I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the topic.

19:02.860 --> 19:06.380
Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.

19:06.380 --> 19:08.620
Like, come on, that should just be common sense.

19:08.620 --> 19:11.820
So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down,

19:11.820 --> 19:13.740
smash that unsubscribe button,

19:13.740 --> 19:17.740
unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos,

19:17.740 --> 19:21.980
and then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have to say.

19:21.980 --> 19:25.580
Um, so, I guess that's it.

19:25.580 --> 19:27.020
I was just kidding about the forest.

19:27.020 --> 19:29.820
I don't fuck with forests, I'm really more of an indoor tranny.

19:29.820 --> 19:36.060
So, guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.

19:36.860 --> 19:41.740
My eyes have seen the glory of the coming day

19:41.820 --> 19:44.540
The King of the Lord

19:44.540 --> 19:48.540
He is trampling out the vintage

19:48.540 --> 19:52.620
Where the graves of wrath are stoned

19:52.620 --> 19:56.700
He hath loosed the fateful lightning

19:56.700 --> 20:00.380
Of his terrible swift sword

20:00.380 --> 20:07.420
His truth is marching on

20:07.420 --> 20:11.260
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

20:11.820 --> 20:16.460
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

20:16.460 --> 20:20.460
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

20:20.460 --> 20:25.180
His truth is marching on!

20:25.180 --> 20:27.580
In the beauty of the lilies

20:27.580 --> 20:30.140
Christ was born across the sea

20:30.140 --> 20:32.700
With a glory in his bosom

20:32.700 --> 20:35.260
That transfigures you and me

20:35.260 --> 20:37.740
As he died to make men holy

20:37.740 --> 20:40.460
Let us die to make men free

20:40.460 --> 20:41.580
While God is with us

20:41.580 --> 20:46.220
God is marching on!

20:46.220 --> 20:50.540
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

20:50.540 --> 20:54.860
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

20:54.860 --> 20:58.860
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

20:58.860 --> 21:04.300
His truth is marching on!

21:04.300 --> 21:05.900
Death to capitalism and the patriarchy

21:05.900 --> 21:06.700
Smash the binary

21:06.700 --> 21:07.740
Hail Satan!

21:07.740 --> 21:10.940
Ow!
