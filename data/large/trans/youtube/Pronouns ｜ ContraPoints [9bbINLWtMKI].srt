69

make you feel bad are true

70
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:30,340
it makes me feel bad that i used to be a sexy sexy boy with rippling abs

71
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,940
but too bad for me because there i am indelibly exhibited on youtube for everyone to

00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:56,880
people that are lying to me just

81
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,640
people that are lying to me just to protect whatever deranged fantasy

82
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:58,660
to protect whatever deranged fantasy

83
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:00,320
to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories i need to tell myself to make it

84
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:00,340
stories i need to tell myself to make it

85
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,680
stories i need to tell myself to make it through the night

86
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:01,700
through the night

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,600
through the night it's probably just dry down there they're

88
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:03,620
it's probably just dry down there they're

89
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,080
it's probably just dry down there they're just ingrown hairs i'm sure plenty of

90
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,100
just ingrown hairs i'm sure plenty of

91
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,600
So look, Shapiro, Benny, baby, I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales, to melt

92
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,800
away every crystal of my snowflakery, and henceforth dispense only the most scalding

93
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
tea.

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,800
All right, big boy?

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,800
Let's have it.

96
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,280
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner, I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner

97
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,280
a she.

98
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:46,760
Because you can't change her sex, you can change her name.

99
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:51,440
Caitlyn Jenner is a man, a biological man, and if he were born with high doses of estrogen

100
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,180
in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman.

101
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,180
You're determined by your chromosomes.

102
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,660
So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype,

103
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,780
that is, XX sex chromosomes.

104
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:07,620
And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she, and to call you she would

105
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,360
be tantamount to a lie.

106
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,940
I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't like let a transgender

107
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,060
like woman be called she or something.

108
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,380
Because it is a lie.

109
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:22,700
So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie, and you think that what it means

110
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,700
to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you're not a she.

111
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,700
You're not a she.

112
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,100
You're a normal female karyotype.

113
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,200
And if you think that when we call a trans woman she, we are saying that she has a normal

114
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,560
female karyotype.

115
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:38,100
But hold on, I'm a transgender woman, and I've never claimed to have a normal female

116
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,280
karyotype, and yet my friends, lovers, and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am,

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,220
girlfriend, ladies â€” good girl, good girl.

118
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,320
Just like that.

119
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Don't stop.

120
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
Don't stop.

121
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,880
Are all of us deluded about my biology?

122
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,880
No.

123
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,820
It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro.

124
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,100
It's the other way around.

125
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,620
It is you who misunderstands language.

126
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,420
You have deceptively framed the debate

127
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,180
as a debate about biology, which it is not.

128
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,040
We all agree on the biology.

129
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,740
The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words,

130
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,300
such as he, she, man, and woman.

131
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,380
But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word?

132
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,160
Well, there are two kinds of arguments we could make,

133
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,140
descriptive or prescriptive.

134
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:20,220
If we take the descriptive approach,

135
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,820
then what we must do is act like anthropologists

136
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,680
and study the way a word, for instance, she,

137
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,700
is used by a linguistic community,

138
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,420
and whatever the social convention is is what's correct.

139
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,640
But if we take the prescriptive approach,

140
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,980
then we must make an argument

141
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:36,980
about the way the word she should be used,

142
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,800
meaning we either defer to an authority,

143
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,960
such as the dictionary,

144
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,220
or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy,

145
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,540
or we must have some goal that we want to accomplish

146
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,880
by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.

147
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,540
Now, if we take the descriptive approach,

148
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:52,580
you lose, Ben Shapiro, because most people call me she,

149
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,860
and that's all there is to it.

150
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:58,820
What's more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical.

151
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
You don't put an article before a pronoun.

152
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,960
That's not how pronouns work, you silly dum-dum.

153
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,360
Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905,

154
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,400
while the English pronouns he and she

155
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
originate in the Proto-Germanic language

156
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,840
spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe,

157
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,940
beginning around 500 BCE.

158
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,740
Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person

159
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,080
pronouns of the English language

160
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,960
refer specifically to karyotype,

161
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,500
it is you, and not I, who is a she.

162
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:25,980
I, who is breaking from linguistic tradition, Ben Shapiro.

163
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,960
However, as a trans woman,

164
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,320
it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions.

165
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,120
So, let's try out a prescriptive approach.

166
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,200
Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used,

167
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,660
how do we decide how a word should be used?

168
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,840
Language is by nature ambiguous,

169
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,940
and the way we attempt to disambiguate it

170
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,360
is often motivated by political goals.

171
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,340
Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she,

172
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,500
because his political goal is to reinforce

173
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,420
rigid conservative gender roles.

174
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:57,820
Whereas, I think we should call trans women she,

175
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,900
because my political goal is to live in a society

176
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,980
where I can achieve the same level of sadness

177
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,840
and dysfunction as everyone else.

178
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,340
It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage

179
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,400
from a decade ago.

180
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
Opponents argue the dictionary

181
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,560
and legal definition of marriage

182
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,680
was union between a man and a woman.

183
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,620
And the definition shouldn't be changed,

184
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,740
because it's the definition.

185
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,380
And how am I supposed to explain to my child?

186
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,380
And on the other hand,

187
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:25,080
Gay people argued that the definition should be changed,

188
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,600
because they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness

189
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,220
and dysfunction as everyone else.

190
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,740
And they succeeded, because as it turns out,

191
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,920
you can in fact change the definitions of words.

192
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:38,200
The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the Bible.

193
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,240
And for that matter, you can change the Bible.

194
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,900
I mean, have you read the contemporary English version?

195
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,220
The prose is atrocious, appalling.

196
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,320
I won't stand for this.

197
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
But unlike the debate about gay marriage,

198
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,980
the question about trans womanhood

199
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,360
is more than just a political and legal dispute.

200
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,300
It seems to me that whatever Church, State,

201
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,300
and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already are,

202
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,960
and will continue to be, women.

203
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,540
And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument

204
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:05,360
posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime rival, Blair White.

205
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,720
Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whomst is bad.

206
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,920
The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting

207
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,140
his usual position that pronouns are used

208
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,540
to designate so-called biological men and biological women.

209
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,740
Blair responds by observing that Ben's way

210
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,860
of using pronouns is, in her case, completely impractical.

211
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:25,720
Well, if you and I were to go to a business dinner,

212
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,280
or any kind of dinner, and you were meeting me

213
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,060
at a restaurant, and I was there first,

214
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,080
and I was in an orange shirt, and you had to tell,

215
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,960
you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blair,

216
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,800
and they said, okay, and you had to describe me

217
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,660
to take me to the table, you wouldn't say the man

218
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,880
in the orange shirt, you would say Blair,

219
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,180
you would say her over there.

220
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,700
Ben then responds, saying,

221
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,680
I think there's some truth to that,

222
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,780
meaning that I think that there is a utility

223
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:49,180
to the use of pronouns, but that's not quite the same

224
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:52,200
as suggesting that a transgender woman is a she

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,340
in the objective sense.

226
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,640
And Blair responds to that

227
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,760
with what I think is a very good analogy.

228
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,020
For instance, if someone were to adopt children,

229
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,500
there's no biological basis for calling them

230
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,200
that kid's parents, because they're not.

231
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,300
Like, they're just literally not,

232
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,160
there's no link at all biologically,

233
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,260
but there is a social reason to do it,

234
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,480
and there's a legal reason to do it.

235
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,080
Let's expand on that analogy.

236
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,580
Suppose you're an adoptive parent,

237
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,020
and you're arguing with someone who says

238
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,600
your adopted child isn't really your child,

239
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,280
and you aren't really a parent.

240
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,180
As evidence, they point out that,

241
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,420
point to the dictionary definition of parent,

242
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,940
one that begets or brings forth offspring.

243
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,100
You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue,

244
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,000
therefore you are not a parent.

245
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,880
Facts don't care about your feelings.

246
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,240
No matter how much you love and care for this child,

247
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,800
you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.

248
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,060
I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument

249
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:41,280
is being uncivil, yes, being provocative,

250
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,940
controversial, politically incorrect.

251
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,940
But they're not just impolite, they're also wrong.

252
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,180
Because an adoptive parent

253
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,300
is, socially and functionally,

254
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,180
just as real a parent as a biological parent.

255
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,640
And to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.

256
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,460
So, what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?

257
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,400
I would say that we actually do have different descriptions

258
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,300
for adoptive parents than biological parents, right?

259
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,340
You'll say in shorthand that they're parents,

260
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,900
because they're all different types of parents,

261
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,980
but we do say adoptive parents.

262
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,680
Right, adoptive parents,

263
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,800
an entirely valid type of parent.

264
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,560
To call them parents is not a lie.

265
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,020
And then the question becomes, okay, exactly, is the,

266
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,820
the context that you were suggesting matters?

267
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,560
In what context are we talking about the parents?

268
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,860
Are we talking about a PTA meeting?

269
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,840
Okay, this person is the legal guardian,

270
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,580
and therefore the parent,

271
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,000
because parenting has two aspects, right?

272
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,620
There's the biological parentage,

273
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,840
and then there is the actual role of parenting.

274
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,620
So yes, there are some contexts

275
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,840
where we do need to distinguish

276
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,960
between biological and adoptive parents.

277
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,400
For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk

278
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,140
of some hereditary disease,

279
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,220
they need to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.

280
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,760
But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts,

281
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,580
it doesn't matter in the slightest.

282
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,840
In the dinner conversation,

283
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,320
the same thing sort of holds true,

284
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,140
meaning there is the biological role of woman,

285
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,020
which you are not,

286
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,160
and then there is the, you look like a woman,

287
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,340
which is, I'm gonna describe you as a woman to the waiter

288
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,800
when he comes to direct me to the table.

289
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,420
Just when Ben seems on the cusp

290
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,600
of having a breakthrough,

291
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,360
he and Blair pause their argument

292
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:09,780
to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.

293
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,600
From what I've seen,

294
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,380
a lot of your interactions with trans people,

295
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,380
they always end up kind of ugly.

296
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,220
You know what I mean?

297
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:17,060
There was the, I think,

298
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,600
I think the person's name was Zoe Turr,

299
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,660
there was the threat of physical violence.

300
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,360
What are your genetics, sir?

301
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,640
You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.

302
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,060
Yeah, I mean, what's hilarious about this, Blair,

303
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,820
is literally the exact same thing

304
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,140
that I'm saying to you right now

305
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,080
is exactly what I said to Zoe Turr on the air.

306
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,460
But that's not exactly true, is it, Ben?

307
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:38,260
Zoe threatened you after you called her sir,

308
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,620
and you didn't call Blair sir, did you?

309
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,360
Why did you call Zoe sir?

310
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,260
What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit,

311
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,960
oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?

312
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,340
I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.

313
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,860
I suppose sir is a strictly biological term.

314
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,120
Queen Guinevere said in days of old,

315
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:00,400
I knight thee, Lancelot, thou that art karyotypically male.

316
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,240
And you're exactly right.

317
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,740
When people start yelling at each other or tweeting out F you,

318
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,060
that's not a great way to change my mind.

319
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,640
It turns out that's not particularly convincing.

320
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,080
So what is a great way to change your mind, Ben Shapiro?

321
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,720
Did Blair bud you an inch with her rationality,

322
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,960
her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?

323
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
It doesn't seem like she's going to change your mind.

324
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,880
She did.

325
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,960
At the end of this debate,

326
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:23,180
you regurgitate your original position undigested.

327
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,620
You know, I'm the editor of a pretty major site,

328
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,200
and my basic rule is that

329
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,640
when we're discussing people who are trans,

330
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,440
we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman,

331
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,480
and then refers to them by their biological pronoun,

332
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,820
because biology is the nature of the pronoun.

333
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,300
Biology is the nature of the pronouns?

334
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,080
Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you

335
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:40,460
that in most contexts that's not true for her?

336
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:42,960
Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.

337
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,300
There are some contexts where it makes sense

338
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,140
to distinguish between adoptive parents

339
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
and adoptive parents.

340
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,660
Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts

341
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,180
where it makes sense to distinguish

342
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,460
between transgender and cisgender,

343
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,100
or as you say, biological women.

344
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,140
For instance, when discussing who needs access

345
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:01,660
to certain reproductive healthcare

346
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,220
you think should be illegal.

347
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,260
But does this apply to pronouns?

348
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,240
That is, are pronouns technical biological terms

349
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,000
denoting karyotypes,

350
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,860
or are they part of the everyday language

351
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,920
we use to describe each other socially?

352
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,820
The answer is obvious.

353
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,960
There are no geneticists studying pronouns.

354
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,600
In fact, there is not a single biology textbook

355
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,260
with a chapter on the difference between

356
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,700
a he and a she.

357
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,200
There is no such thing as biological pronouns.

358
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,920
This is a phrase invented in the last decade

359
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,440
to describe the misgendering of trans people.

360
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,920
So as a trans woman,

361
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,260
I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.

362
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,140
She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me,

363
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,860
regardless of my anatomy,

364
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,220
which is none of your business, Ben Shapiro.

365
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,120
Fascinating though it is.

366
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:46,960
And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother,

367
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,960
that she is a trans woman,

368
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,260
that her son is not her child,

369
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,360
to call me he is not just rude or insensitive.

370
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,820
It is, in effect, false.

371
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,100
But it is also rude and insensitive.

372
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,380
So even if you don't agree with me,

373
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,880
you could still not.

374
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,040
What's the harm, right?

375
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,580
I teach my almost four year old girl

376
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,480
that she can become a boy.

377
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,880
Then I think that is not only lying to her,

378
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,720
I think it's confusing her

379
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,260
and I think it's damaging to her psyche.

380
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,160
Oh yes, the classic argument.

381
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,300
How do I explain to my child?

382
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,480
Kill your shitty child for all I care.

383
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,640
That's simply not my problem.

384
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,400
I regret every night I spent with you, Ben Shapiro.

385
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,040
I'm in a new relationship now with a lesbian.

386
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,600
You and I are through.

387
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.

388
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,680
It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.

389
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,260
I won't allow my children to watch movies

390
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,100
unless there's at least a bloodbath or maybe an orgy.

391
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,380
But hey, I don't choose this schlock.

392
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,500
I just present it.

393
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,580
The second program

394
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,000
of tonight's science fiction double feature

395
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,420
is about a cult of chaos,

396
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,480
hell bent on destroying Western civilization.

397
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,140
I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.

398
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,340
Hi boys, it's points again.

399
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,540
Same queen, new look, try to keep up.

400
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,560
In my previous video, nasty tea babe likes it rough,

401
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,420
I made an argument about why it's correct

402
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,920
to call trans women she,

403
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,980
but I'd be bullshitting you

404
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,000
if I only discussed fully integrated binary trans people.

405
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,880
Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.

406
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,760
Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort

407
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,940
to continue the charade of misgendering them.

408
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:27,720
The transgender woman from Orange is the New Black.

409
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,560
I never watched that show.

410
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,480
I've never watched that show either,

411
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,760
but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.

412
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:31,600
Oh.

413
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,600
Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.

414
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,720
I limited my argument to trans women

415
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,520
who look the way society expects a woman to look

416
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,000
because cis people have an easier time making sense of that.

417
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,400
But the reality is that in a lot of cases,

418
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,840
it's a little more complicated.

419
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,600
Now, as far as early transition trans people go,

420
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,480
I am fairly integrated.

421
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,880
Society basically gets that I'm a woman.

422
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,800
Without me having to explain my gender,

423
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,360
strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.

424
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,040
Hey, haven't I seen your videos on tgirllove.com?

425
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,600
But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.

426
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,280
I got called sir last week by the cashier at H&M.

427
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,720
Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M,

428
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:13,200
but needless to say, it was a desperate emergency.

429
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,600
And by emergency, I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's.

430
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,880
What happened next stays between me and the Lord,

431
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,480
but suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched in-

432
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,360
Okay, I embellished the story a little.

433
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,400
He wasn't cute.

434
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,040
So between being six foot one,

435
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,800
the horrific transsexual squawking

436
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,560
I try to pass off as my voice,

437
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,760
and my tragic inability to conduct myself

438
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,880
in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding,

439
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,000
your girl remains,

440
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,440
despite my desperate, painstaking efforts,

441
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,680
somewhat clockable.

442
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,320
You look great, hun.

443
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,960
In that debate between Ben and Blair,

444
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,800
Blair says that

445
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,080
pronoun usage boils down to what you look like.

446
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:52,080
But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.

447
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,920
And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you

448
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,680
largely based on your appearance.

449
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,400
So appearance definitely matters,

450
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,840
but in my opinion, passing,

451
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,680
in the sense of looking like a cis woman,

452
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,680
is really the most important thing.

453
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,760
What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give off,

454
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:10,760
the way you speak, the gestures, the conversational dynamic.

455
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,680
That kind of stuff to me is what makes a person

456
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,040
viscerally seem like a man or a woman.

457
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,480
So my goal isn't necessarily

458
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,080
to serve unclockable fish,

459
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,240
so much as to embody a certain kind of

460
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,880
diaphanous archetypal femininity.

461
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
In layman's terms, girl dick energy.

462
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,080
Also, I am gonna have a lot of plastic surgery, thank God.

463
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,480
Last month, I released a video called

464
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,000
Sexy Furry Pounded by Skinny T-Babe.

465
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,760
And a lot of trans people got mad at me

466
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,480
because they thought I was saying

467
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,080
that performing your gender is the only thing that matters

468
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,120
and that how you identify counts for nothing.

469
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,600
But that's not what I think.

470
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,120
I do prefer to argue that trans women are women

471
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
because we live the lives of them,

472
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,440
because I think that's a much more compelling argument

473
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,280
than I'm a woman because I psychologically identify

474
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,320
as a woman, which in my experience

475
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,680
doesn't really persuade anyone.

476
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,360
It's just too easy to poke holes in it.

477
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,320
But identity definitely does matter,

478
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,760
especially when it comes to pronouns.

479
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,640
And I'll explain why.

480
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,920
Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people

481
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:07,800
are very sensitive about anyone telling them

482
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,080
what pronouns to use.

483
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,040
So I'm gonna try to be respectful of your feelings

484
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,400
and what a difficult and personal issue

485
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
this must be for you.

486
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,280
After all,

487
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,120
we live in a repressive political era

488
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,160
despite the best efforts of hero professor,

489
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,400
Jordan B. Peterson.

490
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,320
But alas, he was too late.

491
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,960
Now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech

492
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,480
and sends people to jail for,

493
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,440
oh, it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed?

494
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,200
Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail

495
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,560
for pronoun misuse.

496
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Oh, I guess that was a false alarm, huh?

497
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,080
God damn it.

498
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,960
Look, I'm not gonna tell you what pronouns you have to use.

499
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,080
I'm just gonna tell you how I use pronouns

500
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,360
and my reasoning behind it.

501
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,720
And you are welcome to use your free speech

502
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:05,200
to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you wanna be.

503
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,040
Okay?

504
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,800
So back to identity.

505
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:12,120
If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets

506
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,120
and a customer were to walk in looking like this,

507
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
I might ordinarily defend myself.

508
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,040
I might ordinarily default to female pronouns,

509
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,840
but that would be wrong.

510
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
Since I happen to know this person is not only a man,

511
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,640
he is the man.

512
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,000
YouTube's most regal makeup artist,

513
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,840
his lordship, John McClane,

514
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,160
and he uses he, him pronouns.

515
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,680
Likewise, if I were approached by this person,

516
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,800
I'd fall in love and then default to female pronouns.

517
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,600
And this time I'd be correct,

518
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:41,520
but not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,

519
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,440
but because she's gender fluid drag queen, Courtney Act,

520
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,880
who has the fucking audacity

521
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,760
to be a more beautiful woman than I am,

522
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,960
and who, so far as I know,

523
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,880
uses male pronouns in boy mode

524
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,880
and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.

525
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,280
A lot of the complexities of gender, language,

526
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:59,400
identity, and expression get played out in the world of drag.

527
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,320
Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men

528
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,520
who live as men and perform as women.

529
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,600
Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon,

530
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,280
Shea Coulee, and Violet Tchotchke, identify as non-binary.

531
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,040
Others still are bio queens,

532
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,200
cis women who perform as drag queens,

533
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,000
and then there are trans women who are also drag queens,

534
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,640
like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or, for that matter, me.

535
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,600
I mean, look at me.

536
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Do you think I dress like this

537
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,560
when I go to 7-Eleven at 2 a.m.?

538
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,600
Because I do.

539
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,400
Look what I've become, a bisexual, transsexual drag queen.

540
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,640
Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake.

541
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,720
I just, through pure coincidence,

542
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,080
happened to be the most interesting

543
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,480
and unique person who ever lived.

544
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,240
I am so sorry, I can't help it.

545
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,520
So let's recap.

546
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,040
There are gender non-conforming men

547
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,080
who present very femme,

548
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,480
but use male pronouns.

549
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,520
There are cis men who use female pronouns

550
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,120
whenever they present female.

551
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,440
There are gender-fluid people who use different pronouns

552
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,360
depending on their current presentation.

553
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,080
There are pre-transition trans people

554
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,520
who identify as a gender

555
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,400
other than the one they present and live as,

556
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,960
and prefer other pronouns.

557
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,880
So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks,

558
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,320
because there's a lot of situations

559
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,720
where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.

560
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,800
So, as you can see, identity definitely is important,

561
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,360
but it's also not the only thing that matters.

562
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,840
If trans identity were the only thing that mattered,

563
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,720
then there would be no need for a trans person

564
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,920
to come out or do anything to transition,

565
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,240
including requesting different pronouns,

566
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,200
because pronouns belong to the social world of language,

567
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,400
not to individual psychology.

568
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,120
This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.

569
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,280
You can identify however you like,

570
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,480
but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.

571
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,840
So if, for example, you're a trans woman

572
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,320
still living as a man,

573
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,880
then you are fully trans,

574
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,040
your identity is fully valid,

575
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:47,720
but until you begin living as a woman,

576
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,760
your womanhood remains kind of hypothetical.

577
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,360
And when I say living as a woman,

578
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:53,960
I don't mean passing.

579
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,400
There's too much emphasis on physical appearance,

580
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,680
and not enough on social relationships.

581
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,760
You know, you don't become a woman

582
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
the first time you put on a dress.

583
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,000
You become a woman the first time

584
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,360
an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant

585
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,840
and says, maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.

586
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,280
My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.

587
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,360
As far as I'm concerned,

588
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,400
if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet,

589
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,880
they are fully trans.

590
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,320
I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact

591
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,440
that a lot of people's gendered experience

592
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,960
isn't entirely a product of how they identify.

593
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,840
Put it this way,

594
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,520
I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman,

595
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,600
but my thought process behind it isn't always the same.

596
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,320
Many trans women just seem like women to me,

597
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,600
in literally the same way that cis women seem like women.

598
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,880
And I use female pronouns for them effortlessly,

599
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,560
just as I was trained to do from birth.

600
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,880
This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.

601
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,560
We want not necessarily to pass perfectly,

602
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,960
just to seem like our genders to the people around us.

603
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,480
As Laura Jane Grace put it,

604
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,240
you want them to see you like they see every other girl.

605
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,800
I want people calling me she not out of politeness

606
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,880
or respect for my identity as a trans woman,

607
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,280
but just because I seem like a woman to them.

608
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,960
Because the reality is,

609
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,120
not all trans women seem like a woman to me

610
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,640
in that visceral way,

611
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,160
and I live with this constant crushing anxiety

612
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,440
that I don't seem like a woman to other people.

613
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,920
I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen,

614
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,240
and I cope with that fear

615
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,400
by looking like a second-rate drag queen.

616
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,160
But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears

617
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,560
a 0% woman, if she tells me she's a trans woman,

618
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,520
I'm gonna use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.

619
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,480
Not just to be polite,

620
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,920
but also because I wanna recognize the reality

621
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,640
of her psychological experience,

622
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,800
and especially because I wanna help her re-socialize

623
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,360
and reintegrate into the world as her true gender.

624
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,080
And of course, cis people,

625
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:43,160
you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that,

626
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,120
but if you refuse, you are being a shit-gibbon.

627
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,680
And I would prefer that you not be a shit-gibbon.

628
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,960
Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.

629
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,760
An increasing number of people identify

630
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,440
not as male or female, but as non-binary,

631
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,360
an umbrella term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels

632
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,920
such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,

633
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,520
graygender, and so on.

634
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,920
Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.

635
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,800
In English, usually they.

636
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,120
Now, if your first impulse is to argue

637
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,400
that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense,

638
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,400
consider that having gendered singular third-person pronouns

639
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,440
at all is a particular feature of the English language

640
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,840
that's by no means shared by all other languages,

641
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,000
including Turkish, Korean, and Finnish,

642
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,280
which don't have them at all.

643
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,880
Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds

644
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,840
coming out of your mouth

645
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,840
that humans make up to suit our purposes.

646
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,440
If you're new to using singular they,

647
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,040
it is a little confusing at first,

648
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,360
but with some practice, it gets pretty easy.

649
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,840
They poured milk on me.

650
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,280
I poured milk on them.

651
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,080
They did anoint themself in their milk,

652
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,960
and it was good, thus saith the Lord.

653
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,360
So the polite thing to do here,

654
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,960
is easy, if someone asks you to call them they,

655
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,040
you call them they.

656
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,560
But if you're like me,

657
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,000
you don't wanna just do a thing

658
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
because you dogmatically believe it's the woke thing to do.

659
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,400
You wanna understand why you're doing it.

660
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
I don't just wanna tolerate non-binary people.

661
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,720
I want to be a convert.

662
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,280
I wanna believe about them

663
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,800
what they believe about themselves,

664
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,680
so long as those beliefs are reasonable.

665
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,440
So what do all these words mean?

666
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,080
What are these people talking about?

667
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,600
Remember earlier, we distinguished gender expression

668
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,720
from gender identity.

669
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,000
John McClane is feminine

670
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
in expression, but a man in identity.

671
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,560
Whereas I am a woman in identity,

672
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,640
and in expression, I am a mess.

673
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,080
Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's

674
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,840
great contributions to humanity, art, science,

675
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,520
spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futsch scale.

676
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,120
The Futsch scale is a diagram that looks like this

677
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,000
and quantifies from one to 10,

678
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,680
or high femme to stone butch,

679
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,760
the gender expression of a given domain,

680
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,840
such as Mulan looks or Steven Universe characters.

681
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,640
It can also be used more abstractly for weapons,

682
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,880
Pokemon, or wind instruments.

683
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,080
Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do

684
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,520
with words like genderqueer, agender, graygender, and so on

685
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,800
is to give to identity the same kind of specificity

686
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,720
the Futsch scale gives to expression.

687
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,520
But my input on this isn't really worth that much

688
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,040
because I'm not non-binary.

689
00:26:59,040 --> 00:26:59,920
And to tell you the truth,

690
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,800
I kind of feel for cis people here

691
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:04,640
because all this talk about gender identity,

692
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,520
a lot of the time, I don't really get it either.

693
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,320
I look inside myself and ask,

694
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,400
do I feel like a man or a woman?

695
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,360
And over these years,

696
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,000
the answer is still that I feel like shit.

697
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,880
And that's how I experience gender.

698
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,240
I live, I exist as a woman,

699
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,640
which is the only way I can achieve

700
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,720
the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

701
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,040
And I identify as trash.

702
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,640
I guess there are certain moments

703
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,400
that make me feel like a natural woman.

704
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,760
Oh, listening to Aretha Franklin,

705
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,160
the pain and ecstasy of penetration,

706
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,320
waiting in a long ass line for the restroom,

707
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,520
a big strong arm around my waist,

708
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,880
being asked if I have any tampons, having tampons,

709
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,560
in case someone asks,

710
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,000
a dude explaining philosophy 101 to me

711
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,920
and me going, oh really?

712
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,040
Wow.

713
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,880
But you know,

714
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,120
these experiences mean different things to different people.

715
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,040
So all I can really tell you is that

716
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,280
I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures,

717
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,640
that taking female hormones

718
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,440
and having feminizing medical procedures

719
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,440
makes me feel more at home in my body,

720
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,000
and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman,

721
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,480
socially, spiritually, sexually.

722
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,680
So that's the jargon-free explanation of my gender

723
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:11,600
as I see it.

724
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,600
I don't even know what that would mean,

725
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,920
but I do know that the life I live as a woman

726
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,600
is the only life I have,

727
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,480
and that, I think, is legitimate enough.

728
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,240
So, I know what living as a woman means to me,

729
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,720
but what does it mean to live a non-binary life?

730
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:28,480
Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman,

731
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,800
that's something that's gonna vary

732
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
between individuals and cultures.

733
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,120
Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions,

734
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:36,040
such as the Hydra of South Asia,

735
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,400
a local tribe that was born in the Middle East,

736
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,040
and some of them have a lot of history

737
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,440
that has been passed down for generations.

738
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,480
In Asia, a legally recognized gender

739
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,240
in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh

740
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,880
wore the various two-spirit traditions

741
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,920
of indigenous North American tribes.

742
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,520
Non-indigenous American culture

743
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
doesn't have a third gender tradition,

744
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,040
but we do have individual non-binary people,

745
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,600
some of whom are making content

746
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,040
that has taught me a lot about non-binary experience,

747
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,760
non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.

748
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:04,000
We have a lot in common,

749
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,080
binary and non-binary trans people.

750
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,960
Even as a binary trans person,

751
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,560
I used to live as one gender,

752
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,080
and now I live as another gender.

753
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,800
In itself is a pretty serious challenge

754
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,440
to the stability of the binary,

755
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,920
but many of the people who call themselves non-binary

756
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,160
seem to be fighting for something more radical

757
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,400
than what I'm fighting for,

758
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,880
at least in my personal life.

759
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,200
I'm just trying to assimilate

760
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,320
into a pre-existing female gender role.

761
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,440
As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed,

762
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,840
the traditional female garb of my culture.

763
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,800
No!

764
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,280
Whereas non-binary people

765
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,800
are trying to cast off these roles entirely,

766
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,440
trying to create the society that includes them.

767
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,480
And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes

768
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,080
with some non-binary people who, for example,

769
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,200
promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.

770
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,920
Whereas, I love it when people assume my gender,

771
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,160
provided they assume it correctly.

772
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,880
Otherwise, I will throw you

773
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,200
an imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.

774
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,400
But what we all agree on is that many trans,

775
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,680
non-binary, and gender non-conforming people

776
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,640
find it easier to navigate the world using pronouns

777
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,160
other than the ones that Ben Shapiro wants you to use.

778
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,840
If you want me to call you they,

779
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,080
I'm gonna call you they.

780
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,200
And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer,

781
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,000
to do or say anything,

782
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,280
I do hope you use your free will to freely choose

783
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:25,640
to use your freedom of speech to choose to do the same.

784
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,480
Freely.

785
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,880
Wow, at least there was a hideous monster this time.

786
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,000
I'm talking about the female lead.

787
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,480
Pfft, pfft.

788
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,200
The show's over.

789
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor.

790
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,960
So goodbye, my satanic subscribers.

791
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,200
Until next week,

792
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,520
go to hell.

793
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:22,280
Oh, oh, oh, this is who I am, yeah, oh.

794
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:33,280
We'll go hang in heaven, in heaven, in heaven.

795
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:53,840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
