WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I

00:15.000 --> 00:19.920
Like stuff I like this and I like this and I like this I

00:19.920 --> 00:29.720
Like stuff and I want more stuff

00:30.920 --> 00:37.780
My child hearken to my voice. It is I Socrates. Oh, no. What do you want?

00:37.780 --> 00:40.360
I haven't seen you at the symposium of late

00:40.760 --> 00:46.680
Well, yeah, because you kind of hate women and it was getting me down my child without my guidance

00:46.680 --> 00:48.680
You have become a slave to mere appetite

00:48.680 --> 00:55.820
Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness the rational contemplation of truth and justice?

00:56.300 --> 01:00.140
Look, I tried that and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing

01:00.300 --> 01:06.260
I'm a dum-dum and I like shiny things. Ah, but my child these are pleasures for the pigs

01:06.940 --> 01:10.700
Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself

01:11.440 --> 01:15.080
Perfectly exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys

01:15.920 --> 01:18.640
Okay, thank you for your feedback. We'll take that away

01:18.680 --> 01:24.260
I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things and these are questions really better left to the philosophers

01:24.260 --> 01:27.380
Which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this video

01:27.380 --> 01:32.300
Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works of anti-capitalist philosophy ever produced

01:32.300 --> 01:38.300
A series in multiple volumes that examines deeply the importance of the idea of happiness

01:38.300 --> 01:40.300
And I hope you enjoy it

01:40.300 --> 01:42.300
And I hope you enjoy it

01:42.300 --> 01:44.300
And I hope you enjoy it

01:44.300 --> 01:46.300
And I hope you enjoy it

01:46.300 --> 01:48.300
And I hope you enjoy it

01:48.680 --> 01:50.680
And I hope you enjoy it

01:50.680 --> 01:52.680
And I hope you enjoy it

01:52.680 --> 01:54.680
And I hope you enjoy it

01:54.680 --> 01:56.680
I'll see you in the next video

02:18.680 --> 02:23.640
and a $1 ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold,

02:23.640 --> 02:27.880
and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel that's made of gold.

02:27.880 --> 02:29.000
It is a lot of gold.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.680
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

02:30.680 --> 02:31.800
A gongipreneur!

02:31.800 --> 02:36.440
Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder.

02:36.440 --> 02:41.560
But we intellectuals, well, we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.

02:41.560 --> 02:43.800
We like to take it all in.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.520
Ah!

02:44.520 --> 02:50.440
The Worth It boys, Andrew, Adam, Steven, these are not mere content creators,

02:50.440 --> 02:54.360
mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad revenue.

02:54.360 --> 02:59.640
They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even, and what they've accomplished on YouTube,

02:59.640 --> 03:04.200
quite honestly, far surpasses the combined insights of Marx, Engels,

03:04.200 --> 03:09.560
Lenin, Sartre, Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, Lukács, Zarathustra,

03:09.560 --> 03:12.120
and even our dear bread mom, Kropotkin.

03:12.120 --> 03:14.120
I've of course read each of these great thinkers

03:14.120 --> 03:14.520
completely.

03:14.520 --> 03:16.360
It works many, many times.

03:16.360 --> 03:20.760
But I always come away dissatisfied, and I find myself returning, yet again,

03:20.760 --> 03:24.360
to the unparalleled masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.

03:24.360 --> 03:29.000
See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.680
Is it worth it?

03:30.680 --> 03:31.800
We may never know.

03:31.800 --> 03:36.920
Take, for instance, the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.

03:36.920 --> 03:38.680
Which is the better deal?

03:38.680 --> 03:42.440
I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?

03:42.440 --> 03:44.120
Well, according to Karl Marx,

03:44.120 --> 03:47.320
the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.

03:47.320 --> 03:53.000
On the one hand, there's the use value, the commodity's capacity to satisfy some human need.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.040
And on the other hand, there is the exchange value,

03:56.040 --> 04:00.760
the quantity determining the ratio by which a commodity is exchangeable with every other

04:00.760 --> 04:06.360
commodity, deriving from objectified labor over time and expressed in terms of price.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.360
But let's not oversimplify things.

04:08.360 --> 04:13.960
Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us, the viewers of Worth It, to understand,

04:13.960 --> 04:19.640
the use-value-exchange-value dichotomy, not as a mere hierarchical binary,

04:19.640 --> 04:24.680
but as a sort of Deleuzian rhizome, a non-arborescent multiplicity,

04:24.680 --> 04:29.000
with as many sinuous interconnections as the truffles on the pizza itself.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.600
Am I making myself clear?

04:30.600 --> 04:31.160
I'm not.

04:31.160 --> 04:34.840
It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon

04:34.840 --> 04:37.160
and not actually helping me think through this any better.

04:37.160 --> 04:42.120
So, let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.

04:42.120 --> 04:43.080
Fuck this!

04:43.960 --> 04:53.640
I like stuff.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.160
And I like shiny things.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.240
Now, that's something everyone can understand,

04:57.240 --> 05:02.360
so let's take that as the first axiom of the economic theory I'll be developing in this video.

05:02.360 --> 05:06.040
So, given that I like stuff and I like shiny things,

05:06.040 --> 05:07.480
let's return to the question.

05:07.480 --> 05:10.120
Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?

05:10.120 --> 05:13.640
Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny,

05:13.640 --> 05:15.000
so I do like that.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.440
But the pizza itself seems kinda gross.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.320
It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras,

05:21.320 --> 05:25.400
stilton cheese, black truffles, gold flakes, and caviar.

05:25.400 --> 05:28.920
These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.

05:28.920 --> 05:32.200
The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.

05:32.200 --> 05:35.560
It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment.

05:35.560 --> 05:40.040
But Andrew and Steven sit there with New York's financial district for a backdrop,

05:40.040 --> 05:43.320
and they try to pretend that the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.

05:43.640 --> 05:48.840
I'm honestly speechless.

05:48.840 --> 05:49.720
I feel weird.

05:49.720 --> 05:50.520
Is it the gold?

05:50.520 --> 05:52.200
I just ate $250.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
I feel kinda like I'm committing a crime.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.680
And that's what $1,250 looks like.

05:59.320 --> 06:04.600
There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza

06:04.600 --> 06:09.320
isn't worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.

06:09.320 --> 06:13.080
It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money

06:13.080 --> 06:17.720
on some gilded piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.

06:17.720 --> 06:19.560
Is there a name for that feeling?

06:19.560 --> 06:23.080
Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.

06:23.080 --> 06:26.280
In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia,

06:26.280 --> 06:30.600
a bad pizza covered in gold would just be a bad pizza covered in gold.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.880
You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza,

06:33.880 --> 06:37.960
but you probably wouldn't be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.

06:37.960 --> 06:41.800
To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it,

06:41.800 --> 06:42.280
you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.

06:42.280 --> 06:42.520
You have to understand it in a way that is not worth it, and you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.080
You have to understand it in a way that is not worth it, and you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.920
in the context of capitalism.

06:44.920 --> 06:49.320
The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza,

06:49.320 --> 06:53.320
and if you live in America, you have an instinctive sense for what that means,

06:53.320 --> 06:56.680
because you know all the other things you could buy with $2,000.

06:56.680 --> 07:02.360
For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or health care, or golden nails.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.720
And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening

07:05.720 --> 07:08.520
worrying about how they're going to afford golden nails.

07:08.520 --> 07:12.280
And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem

07:12.280 --> 07:12.680
And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem

07:12.680 --> 07:17.400
not just aesthetically disappointing, but almost obscene, or even immoral.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.640
But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.280
So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go

07:24.280 --> 07:28.040
Pizzas in Africa could have eaten those children, how dare you!

07:28.040 --> 07:31.480
Because the problem isn't that Andrew, Adam, and Steven are bad people

07:31.480 --> 07:35.000
for buying an expensive flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.

07:35.000 --> 07:39.080
The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable

07:39.080 --> 07:42.600
these repulsive juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.

07:42.600 --> 07:45.800
That's why I don't really agree with a philosopher, Peter Singer,

07:45.800 --> 07:49.240
who has this idea that many of the world's problems could be solved

07:49.240 --> 07:53.160
if privileged American college students would just become hedge fund managers

07:53.160 --> 07:56.680
and donate most of their income to buying mosquito nets in the Congo.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.640
I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations,

07:59.640 --> 08:03.560
but it's not going to change the fact that the global economy is structured around

08:03.560 --> 08:07.880
cheap, exploited labor at the bottom, and $2,000 pizzas at the top.

08:07.880 --> 08:12.520
Another way to approach this issue might be to ask, who are the goddamn reptiles?

08:12.600 --> 08:14.920
Well, they're certainly not the Jews.

08:14.920 --> 08:19.960
I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page, that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.

08:20.840 --> 08:23.480
Except, you know, cucking the white race.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.720
But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.960
The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.

08:27.960 --> 08:29.640
So the lizards are not the Jews.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.960
They're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis.

08:31.960 --> 08:35.080
They're not freemasons or globalists or the gay agenda.

08:35.080 --> 08:39.000
But the key insight is that they're not even really the capitalists.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.640
The lizards are capital itself.

08:41.640 --> 08:42.120
And what are they?

08:42.120 --> 08:42.360
They're the capitalists.

08:42.360 --> 08:42.440
They're the capitalists.

08:42.440 --> 08:42.520
They're the capitalists.

08:42.520 --> 08:42.580
They're the capitalists.

08:42.580 --> 08:42.600
They're the capitalists.

08:42.600 --> 08:43.480
What does that mean?

08:43.480 --> 08:44.600
Well, I don't know.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.320
But it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?

08:47.320 --> 08:50.760
What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy are not just the product

08:50.760 --> 08:54.040
of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.

08:54.040 --> 08:57.160
Of course, some capitalists are terrible people.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.680
But some probably aren't.

08:58.680 --> 09:02.920
And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.

09:02.920 --> 09:07.320
So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact that the extreme

09:07.320 --> 09:11.640
economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.

09:11.640 --> 09:12.440
If I were to translate this into English, I would say that the golden pizza is the

09:12.440 --> 09:12.680
golden pizza.

09:12.680 --> 09:15.480
If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument, it would go

09:15.480 --> 09:16.600
something like this.

09:16.600 --> 09:21.560
Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic system because, although it's good at creating

09:21.560 --> 09:26.120
large amounts of wealth, it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way, where

09:26.120 --> 09:31.320
efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth, but as the capacity

09:31.320 --> 09:33.000
to maximize human happiness.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.160
Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.040
Here's a question.

09:36.040 --> 09:39.800
Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?

09:39.800 --> 09:42.420
It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve the economy.

09:42.420 --> 09:43.300
It should serve humanity.

09:43.300 --> 09:47.700
So what I look for in a good economic system is that it produces the most happiness for

09:47.700 --> 09:49.060
the people who are a part of it.

09:49.060 --> 09:52.820
So if you're willing to go along with this, the first question we should ask is, does

09:52.820 --> 09:55.060
having more wealth make people happier?

09:55.060 --> 09:59.540
And we actually have data about that, at least within the context of our own economic system.

09:59.540 --> 10:04.260
And the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness, up to a certain point.

10:04.260 --> 10:10.180
But the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus somewhere between $65,000 and $95,000

10:10.180 --> 10:10.660
a year.

10:10.660 --> 10:10.740
That's a lot of money.

10:10.740 --> 10:10.820
That's a lot of money.

10:10.820 --> 10:10.900
That's a lot of money.

10:10.900 --> 10:10.980
That's a lot of money.

10:10.980 --> 10:11.060
That's a lot of money.

10:11.060 --> 10:11.300
That's a lot of money.

10:11.300 --> 10:11.540
That's a lot of money.

10:11.540 --> 10:11.620
That's a lot of money.

10:11.620 --> 10:11.700
That's a lot of money.

10:11.700 --> 10:11.780
That's a lot of money.

10:11.780 --> 10:16.020
And the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold is that at lower income

10:16.020 --> 10:21.380
levels, more income means less stress about paying rent, or mortgages, or medical bills,

10:21.380 --> 10:22.500
or college tuition.

10:22.500 --> 10:27.380
But once you pass the threshold, more income basically just translates into more disappointing

10:27.380 --> 10:28.500
golden pizzas.

10:28.500 --> 10:33.940
If that interpretation is correct, then the current income distribution seems really irrational,

10:33.940 --> 10:36.260
at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.

10:36.260 --> 10:40.900
The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme, so that

10:40.900 --> 10:46.740
the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone, but the national

10:46.740 --> 10:51.060
median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.

10:51.060 --> 10:58.180
Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year, several times the

10:58.180 --> 10:59.700
peak happiness threshold.

10:59.700 --> 11:04.980
So at least to my naive eyes, what it looks like is that millions of people in this country

11:04.980 --> 11:10.260
don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and healthcare,

11:10.260 --> 11:15.460
while a few million others are, like, constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.

11:15.460 --> 11:17.780
But I'm guessing it's even worse than that.

11:17.780 --> 11:21.780
Because it's not just that some people don't have enough money to meet all of their needs,

11:21.780 --> 11:25.700
it's that they have to be poor while other people are rich.

11:25.700 --> 11:30.580
And since people compare themselves to others, that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties

11:30.580 --> 11:32.740
and resentments and social tensions.

11:32.740 --> 11:37.060
There's a study of capuchin monkeys that shows if you reward one monkey for a task

11:37.060 --> 11:40.100
with a delicious grape, and a monkey in the adjacent cage

11:40.100 --> 11:44.100
with a shitty cucumber, the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.

11:44.100 --> 11:48.180
And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.

11:48.180 --> 11:50.020
But that's just how it looks to me.

11:50.020 --> 11:50.900
I could be wrong.

11:50.900 --> 11:56.100
I mean, I'm not an economic theorist, and honestly, I don't really understand how the

11:56.100 --> 11:57.060
economy works.

11:57.060 --> 11:59.940
I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.

11:59.940 --> 12:02.660
I make the videos, I swipe the card.

12:02.660 --> 12:07.780
So look, if I'm wrong and capitalism is good, actually, just leave a comment and I'll be

12:07.780 --> 12:09.140
happy to be proven wrong.

12:09.140 --> 12:09.940
But before you do that, I want to thank you for watching this video.

12:09.940 --> 12:10.020
I hope you enjoyed it, and I'll see you in the next one.

12:10.020 --> 12:10.080
Bye!

12:10.100 --> 12:13.220
But let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.

12:13.220 --> 12:17.220
Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.

12:17.220 --> 12:21.300
Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.

12:21.300 --> 12:25.940
Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.

12:25.940 --> 12:29.940
And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs just to sustain

12:29.940 --> 12:31.300
themselves and their families.

12:31.300 --> 12:34.980
It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.

12:34.980 --> 12:37.620
But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.

12:37.620 --> 12:39.940
Why would anyone become an innovator or medical

12:39.940 --> 12:42.660
researcher if they could make a good living as a janitor?

12:42.660 --> 12:46.420
Well, janitorial work is pretty important, actually.

12:46.420 --> 12:50.740
Someone has to cook and clean, and I think people who do such necessary work deserve

12:50.740 --> 12:51.540
a decent living.

12:51.540 --> 12:55.620
But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring, and I think that the

12:55.620 --> 13:00.740
kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent often isn't driven mainly by profit

13:00.740 --> 13:01.300
anyway.

13:01.300 --> 13:05.460
Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine, even though he could have made millions of

13:05.460 --> 13:09.860
dollars from it, because he just cared about humanity, and he was driven by a purpose,

13:09.860 --> 13:11.460
beyond personal profit.

13:11.460 --> 13:16.180
In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people who didn't need to

13:16.180 --> 13:20.660
work for a living at all, and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.180
So let me get this straight.

13:22.180 --> 13:26.980
You criticise capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.

13:26.980 --> 13:28.100
Hypocrite much?

13:28.100 --> 13:33.140
A few years ago, I was a broke philosophy graduate student, and when I criticised capitalism

13:33.140 --> 13:34.740
then, people used to say,

13:34.740 --> 13:37.940
Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?

13:37.940 --> 13:39.620
You just resent capitalism because you don't have enough money to make a living.

13:39.620 --> 13:39.780
You don't have enough money to make a living.

13:39.780 --> 13:39.860
You don't have enough money to make a living.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.500
You're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.

13:42.500 --> 13:47.300
So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticise it because they're just resentful,

13:47.300 --> 13:51.700
and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticise it because they're hypocrites,

13:51.700 --> 13:56.340
then, according to you, is anyone allowed to criticise capitalism?

13:56.340 --> 14:00.820
Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.

14:00.820 --> 14:04.260
You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.540
Well, no, I wouldn't.

14:06.420 --> 14:07.460
Hello.

14:07.460 --> 14:09.140
I'm Tatyana Tankikova.

14:09.140 --> 14:09.780
I'm here to...

14:09.780 --> 14:11.300
I'm here to defend Stalin.

14:11.300 --> 14:11.940
Fuck off!

14:12.740 --> 14:14.340
Do svidaniya, fascist.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.020
Do svidaniya, fascist.

14:16.020 --> 14:19.540
So, granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty.

14:19.540 --> 14:23.380
But that doesn't mean that the current system is the best and final system for all time.

14:23.380 --> 14:28.180
My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,

14:28.180 --> 14:33.620
but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.

14:33.620 --> 14:36.660
Okay, but I like stuff.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.180
I like stuff too.

14:38.180 --> 14:39.700
I think a lot of people have this instinct,

14:39.700 --> 14:43.620
this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes, so does everything we love.

14:43.620 --> 14:47.540
I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity,

14:47.540 --> 14:54.420
scarcity, conformity, undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,

14:54.420 --> 14:57.860
just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.

14:57.860 --> 15:00.980
And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,

15:00.980 --> 15:04.500
since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.

15:04.500 --> 15:09.540
But the stuff I'm worried about — booze, makeup, art, baths — these things existed,

15:09.540 --> 15:12.580
long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.

15:12.580 --> 15:15.860
And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about.

15:15.860 --> 15:16.900
Straight guys will be like,

15:16.900 --> 15:20.020
Will there be video games after capitalism? Oh god!

15:20.020 --> 15:21.380
And yeah, there will be.

15:21.380 --> 15:24.660
Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.

15:29.140 --> 15:31.780
Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved,

15:31.780 --> 15:34.100
if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.

15:34.100 --> 15:37.940
I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.

15:37.940 --> 15:39.340
The last time I was reading the,

15:39.340 --> 15:42.740
only book I've ever read, Ways of Seeing by John Berger,

15:42.740 --> 15:46.580
I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.

15:46.580 --> 15:49.700
Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.820
Happiness as judged from the outside by others.

15:52.820 --> 15:56.180
The happiness of being envied is glamour.

15:56.180 --> 16:00.180
And I felt kind of attacked, because glamour is very important to us.

16:00.180 --> 16:01.940
And by us, I mean the gays.

16:01.940 --> 16:07.460
The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy Qs.

16:07.460 --> 16:08.980
But isn't it kind of true that,

16:08.980 --> 16:10.460
at least in advertising,

16:10.460 --> 16:15.260
the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy in the beholder,

16:15.260 --> 16:16.860
in the service of selling you shit?

16:16.860 --> 16:20.460
But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour,

16:20.460 --> 16:21.900
not something essential to it.

16:21.900 --> 16:24.300
And maybe, glamour would actually be liberated

16:24.300 --> 16:26.700
if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.

16:26.700 --> 16:29.820
So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that,

16:29.820 --> 16:31.580
actually, stuff is good.

16:31.580 --> 16:32.540
Glamour is good.

16:32.540 --> 16:33.740
Video games are good.

16:33.740 --> 16:34.780
Luxury is good.

16:34.780 --> 16:35.820
Baths are good.

16:35.820 --> 16:38.940
I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it

16:38.980 --> 16:39.620
horribly.

16:39.620 --> 16:42.100
You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza

16:42.100 --> 16:45.740
is ultimately that the two dollar pizza is actually better.

16:45.740 --> 16:47.300
The golden pizza is an affront,

16:47.300 --> 16:50.260
not just to the people whose medical bills it could have paid,

16:50.260 --> 16:53.060
but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.

16:53.060 --> 16:55.260
So I guess my final take here is,

16:55.260 --> 16:57.900
actually, champagne socialism is good.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.820
But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.860
I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.

17:03.860 --> 17:04.660
All right.

17:04.660 --> 17:06.700
Now that I've gotten these objections out of the way,

17:06.700 --> 17:08.340
I'm finally ready to get started.

17:08.980 --> 17:10.620
Which you've all been waiting for.

17:10.620 --> 17:13.060
How to end capitalism once and for all.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.660
Well, I don't know.

17:14.660 --> 17:16.060
Who do you people think I am?

17:16.060 --> 17:18.260
I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer,

17:18.260 --> 17:20.180
not transsexual Gandhi.

17:20.180 --> 17:21.380
I mean, according to Marxism,

17:21.380 --> 17:24.020
we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.

17:24.020 --> 17:25.540
Capitalism has to fail,

17:25.540 --> 17:28.540
and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.

17:28.540 --> 17:32.180
So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.020
I'm sure it's bound to happen any day now.

17:38.980 --> 17:44.220
You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.

17:44.220 --> 17:45.740
Uh, so, I don't know.

17:45.740 --> 17:48.180
I guess vote Labour.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.780
Tweet radically.

17:49.780 --> 17:52.540
Try to eat more vegetables.

17:52.540 --> 17:57.500
Try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people.

17:57.500 --> 18:03.300
And can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?

18:04.460 --> 18:05.580
No.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.020
No voting.

18:07.020 --> 18:08.220
Smashing.

18:08.220 --> 18:09.820
Well, you know what?

18:09.820 --> 18:11.660
Since she's the one with the plan, apparently,

18:11.660 --> 18:13.940
I guess just do whatever she says.

18:13.940 --> 18:15.700
Rebel girl!

18:15.700 --> 18:17.420
Rebel girl!

18:17.420 --> 18:18.220
Rebel girl!

18:18.220 --> 18:21.340
Tabby, why don't you go take a bath?

18:21.340 --> 18:23.260
Meow.

18:23.260 --> 18:24.180
Mm.

18:24.180 --> 18:25.220
Good kitty.

18:25.220 --> 18:26.620
Don't close the door!

18:26.620 --> 18:27.540
Dear comrades,

18:27.540 --> 18:30.940
the Central Catgirl Committee has determined that ContraPoints is,

18:30.940 --> 18:32.020
and always has been,

18:32.020 --> 18:34.540
counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.

18:34.540 --> 18:38.100
The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video

18:38.100 --> 18:40.380
with a tribute to the immortal science of tabia-,

18:41.180 --> 18:42.540
dirt, dirt.

18:42.540 --> 18:47.140
No.

18:47.140 --> 18:47.940
No—

18:47.940 --> 18:48.680
No!

18:48.680 --> 18:49.940
22

19:19.940 --> 19:49.920
Thank you.

19:49.940 --> 19:55.320
Thank you.
