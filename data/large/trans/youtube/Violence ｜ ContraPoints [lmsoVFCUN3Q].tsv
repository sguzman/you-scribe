30000	55680	so why is it that humans just can't stop killing each other well i don't know what do i look like
55680	62080	you some kind of philosopher so look thrasimachus this is a question for god and the prophets
62080	65360	not for preening transsexuals who can't get out of bed without a bloody mary
67200	72080	however if i were to make a modest contribution to the subject i would humbly offer up the
72080	77840	hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because well violence is fun
80400	85120	and when i say that i of course mean that it's fun to be violent it's not fun when other people
85120	93760	are violent to you i mean unless that's what you're into that is what i'm into
93760	97360	did i say you could speak no mistress then shut up
115120	119520	you're so so boring
126800	130100	this is the story of great man and great woman
131680	138000	mmm that's good chocolatey stanley kubrick's a clockwork orange is very uncomfortable to watch
138000	141520	and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence most of the movies i like depict
141520	145120	horrible acts of violence i mean if you're gonna watch a non-violent movie you may as well read a
145120	149380	perspective of the sadistic protagonist a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and
149380	153340	dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims. What's creepy about Alex is the
153340	157420	film encourages us to identify with him and he kind of draws us in. I mean he
157420	161860	listens to Beethoven and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever
161860	167860	liked German composers. Also he tries the wine. Try the watch! So we watch Alex kick
167860	171820	and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people and bash
171820	175340	old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks and all of this to
175340	179620	triumphant classical music and show tunes. It's clear that for Alex this is
179620	183940	all a lot of fun. So the question I want to ask is how unusual are people like
183940	188540	this in real life? How normal is it to enjoy violence? I mean extremely violent
188540	191980	behavior is uncommon but part of that might be that most of us live in
191980	196400	political circumstances where behaving like a violent maniac is highly frowned
196400	200560	upon. And there's also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a
200560	201580	moral conscience.
201580	201780	And I think that's one of the reasons why I'm so excited about this film.
201780	201800	And I think that's one of the reasons why I'm so excited about this film.
201800	205240	And I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people don't really enjoy
205240	208880	watching a clockwork orange. It's not that they don't enjoy violence, it's that
208880	212360	in order for them to enjoy violence they need some kind of reassurance that the
212360	216040	violence is okay and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed.
220460	224080	I guess it's kind of like sex. I'm not gonna want to have sex in a fluorescent
224080	227900	lit bathroom stall. At least not since I started taking this shit. I need
227900	231560	candlelight to get me in the mood you know. A little goddamn ambience. And you
231560	235820	could say that the moral conscience is the fluorescent lit bathroom stall of the
235820	240180	human mind. You can't properly enjoy violence with all that internal nagging
240180	244320	going on in the background. But in that case, what is the romantic candlelight of
244320	247900	the sadistic psyche? What do we need to get to a place where we can enjoy
247900	253100	violence? Well, think about the TV show Law and Order SVU, which has just as much
253100	257560	sex and violence as a clockwork orange, but which is much more popular. SVU is a
257560	261400	show where hero cops with no regard for due process brutally interrogate
261400	265120	suspected sex offenders and smash them in the face with wooden drawers.
267220	272080	You like that, don't you? I love it so much. You all do. I think a lot of the
272080	275520	appeal of SVU is that it gives upstanding American citizens a way to
275520	279540	sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes while promising the moral
279540	284500	purification of justified police violence. Oh, so that promise is the
284500	288620	candlelit ambience of the moral psyche. When we believe that violence is morally
288620	291100	justified, we think the guy being thrown around the
291400	295800	interrogation room fucking deserved it, we become capable of enjoying it aesthetically.
295800	300300	Exactly! And I think this kind of moral lampshading partly explains the popularity
300300	305380	of rape-revenge plotlines you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow, and Curious George
305380	309860	Kills the Rapist. For viewers with too many moral hangups to get off on totally senseless
309860	314800	violence, a rape-revenge plotline is a cheap way to establish the emotional precedent required
314800	316880	for gratifying bloody payoff.
316880	321260	wonder if there may not be as much of a psychological difference between the good person's enjoyment
321260	325620	of justified violence and the evil sadist's enjoyment of random violence as we might like
325620	326620	to think.
326620	331040	Yes, the good person has a moral conscience as a kind of inhibitive influence, but once
331040	337640	you get past that, there's a kind of amoral kinetic rapture and swinging, thrashing, stabbing,
337640	342660	shooting, blasting, and burning, an aesthetics of violence and destruction.
342660	347200	Now I for one hardly ever enjoy real-world violence because I empathize with the victim
347200	349780	and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it.
349780	352100	I mean, unless I get real frustrated.
352100	353100	Shut up.
353100	354100	Please, just shut up.
354100	355100	Oh, it's so noisy.
355100	356100	I can't think straight.
356100	357100	You're so filthy.
357100	358100	It's time to drink your milk.
358100	359100	Just...
359100	360100	Mmm.
360100	361100	Mmm.
361100	362100	Mmm.
362100	363100	Mmm.
363100	364100	Mmm.
364100	365100	Mmm.
365100	366100	Mmm.
366100	367100	Mmm.
367100	368100	Mmm.
368100	369100	Mmm.
369100	370100	Mmm.
370100	371100	Mmm.
371100	372100	Mmm.
372100	372600	Mmm.
372600	372640	Mmm.
372640	373140	Mmm.
373140	373640	Mmm.
373640	374140	Mmm.
374140	374640	Mmm.
374640	375140	Mmm.
375140	375640	Mmm.
375640	376140	Mmm.
376140	376640	Mmm.
376640	377140	Mmm.
377140	377640	Mmm.
377640	378140	Mmm.
378140	378640	Mmm.
378640	379140	Mmm.
379140	379640	Mmm.
379640	380140	Mmm.
380140	380640	Mmm.
380640	384640	But you know, when I'm playing video games and there are no moral or practical consequences
384640	388640	to any of my actions, I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath.
388640	394100	I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun doesn't mean that the thing itself is
394100	395100	fun.
395100	402580	I mean, The Sims is a simulation of life, and that's fun, but life itself... is terrible.
402580	418120	Bye-bye,
418120	423660	everyone!
423660	427580	BYE!
427580	429960	To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help.
429960	430960	I'm actually FINE.
430960	432520	I have TONS of friends!
432520	437520	I'm fine. I'm really- I'm fine. I'M HAPPY, OKAY?
437520	447520	Here's what I want to know. Unless violence is fun on some basic level, why are simulations of it so fun that the gameplay of most video games is based entirely around it?
447520	454520	Some critics have suggested that this is simply toxic masculinity at work, and that it's a patriarchal moral defect that our media is so violent.
454520	458520	And yeah, it's true that men are mostly responsible for this, granted.
458520	467520	But honestly, I feel a little bit infantilized by the moral critique, since I like violent media, and I feel like I can tell the difference between real and fictional violence.
467520	471520	Although sometimes the distinction between real and simulated violence can get blurry.
471520	473520	...that I usually like to think.
473520	481520	Little baby, don't you cry. Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.
483520	486520	Joshua Oppenheimer's disturbing documentary, The Act of Killing,
486520	488520	chronicles the contemporary lives of the East.
488520	494520	It's about the Indonesian gangsters who massacred millions of alleged communists from 1965 to 1966.
494520	502520	One of the killers, Anwar Kongo, explains on a local television program that his torture and murder methods were inspired by sadistic American movies.
502520	508520	With their own methods, we see each other as if we were the mafia.
508520	512520	When he was on the road, he was in the middle of the motorbike, tied up with a rope.
512520	514520	When he was ready, he threw it away.
514520	516520	At night, waiting for the night to come, we threw it away.
516520	518520	The documentary takes a surreal perspective.
518520	523520	It takes a surreal turn as the original perpetrator is set to work producing cinematic reenactments of their youthful war crimes,
523520	527520	stylizing the events after westerns, mafia films, and other Hollywood genres.
527520	530520	It's a particularly uncomfortable case of life imitating art.
530520	536520	And on that topic, Stanley Kubrick had a clockwork orange withdrawn from British distribution in 1973,
536520	539520	after the film was alleged to have influenced a handful of real-life assaults.
539520	542520	Now I'm not saying that violent movies make people violent,
542520	546520	and we know that most consumers of violent media never commit acts of violence themselves.
546520	550520	I mean, I watch violent movies all the time, and I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.
552520	556520	So now, woke ContraPoints thinks child abuse is funny.
556520	560520	I personally drowned several of my babies, and it was very traumatic for me.
560520	563520	Why did I become an SJW again?
563520	569520	Hey, what I want to know is what's the difference between fans of violent movies who are peaceful and those who are sadistic killers?
569520	574520	Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster with a thousand dead communists under his belt?
576520	579520	Killing people is the most serious crime.
579520	581520	But how do we...
583520	584520	How do we...
584520	589520	Genoa still considers what you're doing to be a serious crime.
589520	593520	We don't necessarily agree with the International Court of Justice, as I said earlier.
593520	597520	So it could be that the Genoa Convention is also the truth now.
597520	598520	The Genoa Convention.
598520	600520	Tomorrow there's the Jakarta Convention.
600520	602520	We'll throw away the Genoa Convention.
602520	604520	So in other words, as long as you can justify it to yourself
604520	606520	with some kind of flimsy excuse,
606520	608520	you can kill without remorse.
608520	612520	And I imagine it also helps when the US-backed government of your country endorses the killing
612520	614520	and you never have to face any consequences for it.
614520	619520	What's interesting to me is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence is psychologically identical,
619520	623520	whether or not your justification rationally holds up or makes any sense.
623520	627520	In other words, the psychology of a righteous sadist may not differ from that of an evil sadist,
627520	630520	except that the former happens to have better reasons backing him up,
630520	632520	or lives in a better political situation.
632520	635520	But hold on, is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist?
635520	637520	I think it's okay to enjoy violent movies,
637520	640520	but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence?
640520	642520	What would be helpful here is an example,
642520	645520	some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous,
645520	647520	and that a lot of them probably even enjoy.
647520	650520	Unfortunately, my audience is morally superior,
650520	652520	and none of them would ever enjoy
661520	664520	ContraPoints has completely leapt out
664520	670520	and can't stop wringing your hands over a poor little Nazi getting hit in the face.
670520	671520	Awww.
671520	674520	Alright, alright, let's grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable.
674520	676520	Let's say it's morally required, even.
676520	678520	Well, why don't we try to bring everyone on board?
678520	681520	Suppose there's a Nazi TERF and he's about to punch a baby,
681520	685520	and punching the TERF Nazi is the only way to stop him from punching the baby.
685520	688520	Socrates, is it just to punch the baby puncher?
688520	691520	ContraPoint sponsors would like to apologize to the baby community
691520	693520	for this video's ongoing trivialization and infanticide.
694520	697520	They'd also like you to know that some of Natalie's best friends are babies,
697520	699520	and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.
699520	703520	Why are we even still talking about this over-discussed Nazi-punching bullshit?
703520	707520	I guess part of it is that it's the only recent example of actual far-left violence in America
707520	709520	that anyone seems to be able to dig up.
710520	712520	Not for long, bourgeois dogs!
712520	715520	Catgirls of the world, unite!
715520	719520	Tabby, could you bring it down just 27 notches or so?
722520	723520	Why don't you take a second to relax?
723520	725520	Just chill out a little bit.
725520	727520	Here, have some spiked milk.
737520	740520	That is having a very interesting effect on her.
740520	743520	I guess my continued uneasiness with leftist punching discourse,
743520	746520	whether it's Nazis or TERFs or whatever, is twofold.
746520	748520	First, there's the optics problem.
748520	751520	We want to convince people that, for instance,
751520	754520	trans women are not creepy men who want to assault cis women.
754520	756520	And I can't help but wonder, is the slogan,
756520	761520	kill all TERFs, really the most effective way to convey that message?
762520	766520	And I realize the costume I'm wearing is not the best for making this point either.
766520	769520	But, you know, I just didn't plan well.
769520	773520	The other worry has to do with when violence stops being strategic
773520	777520	and starts being fun, as in our collective enjoyment of the Richard Spencer punch.
777520	780520	Because then it's not just that we're saying sometimes preemptive violence is necessary
780520	782520	to prevent worse crimes.
782520	784520	It's that we're actively fucking enjoying it.
784520	788520	And any time real violence becomes fun, that's a little alarming,
788520	790520	because even if your actions are genuinely justified,
790520	793520	you don't want to get in the habit of enjoying real violence,
793520	796520	because the violence will continue to be fun,
796520	798520	whether or not your justifications are any good.
798520	802520	Though I agree there's something sort of inherently liberal about this anti-sadism hang-up.
802520	806520	For most of history, it was just accepted that war involves a certain amount of rape and pillage,
806520	809520	and that executions were entertaining public spectacles.
809520	813520	As a boring French postmodernist called Michael Foucault pointed out,
813520	817520	in the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a so-called humanitarian revolution
817520	821520	that was suddenly ashamed of overt sadism with respect to criminal justice
821520	824520	and treatment of the mentally ill, replacing brutal executions
824520	826520	with intricate techniques of discipline.
826520	830520	And a boring French communist called Alain Badiou
830520	834520	argued that this contemporary ethics based on pity and tolerance
834520	837520	is actually just fucking neoliberal bullshit
837520	842520	that encourages first-world people to stage third-world humanitarian interventions
842520	844520	that look a lot like invasions for some reason,
844520	846520	as well as opposing genuine liberation movements
846520	849520	on the grounds that such movements amount to violent ideology,
849520	850520	the bourgeois liberals claim.
850520	854520	So I guess in a sense, my weird hang-up about violence benefits the people in power,
854520	857520	since you have to break a few eggs to make a communist utopia,
857520	859520	and sometimes to make political progress,
859520	861520	you have to tar and feather some folks,
861520	863520	and cut their heads off just a little bit,
863520	865520	or punch them in the fucking face.
865520	867520	Now I realize all the non-leftists watching this
867520	869520	are absolutely horrified right now,
869520	870520	and they're thinking,
870520	874520	what's to stop your violent revolution from becoming just as bloodthirsty and unjust
874520	876520	as those Indonesian gangsters killing communists?
876520	877520	To which I respond,
877520	878520	well, that's an easy one.
878520	880520	It's because my side are the good people,
880520	881520	and your side are the bad people.
881520	882520	I'm so sorry.
882520	884520	Seriously though, that is a pretty good question.
884520	886520	Why don't I change the subject
886520	889520	to avoid how much of a problem it is for the argument I'm making?
889520	891520	Isn't all politics kind of violent?
891520	893520	What about capitalism?
893520	896520	Politics is the practice of organizing groups of human beings,
896520	900520	and it's the relations of power that maintain or disrupt that organization.
900520	903520	So there's always violence or the threat of violence in there somewhere.
903520	904520	In our own society,
904520	907520	police will use violence against us if we disobey the law,
907520	908520	or are black.
908520	910520	And even when white people do obey the law,
910520	913520	there's always the implicit threat of police violence,
913520	915520	including the potential arrest and incarceration
915520	918520	of pretty much every citizen who doesn't have enough money to-
919520	922520	Let's talk about Western values.
922520	925520	According to the great tradition of European political thought,
925520	928520	sovereign power is justified by the social contract.
928520	932520	In other words, we all consent to be governed because it's in our own interest.
932520	935520	Except it's really hypothetical consent more than anything,
935520	937520	because no one actually asks you,
937520	939520	and you can't say no.
939520	940520	Wait a minute.
942520	945520	I guess if you live in a liberal capitalist society,
945520	949520	it's pretty easy to see how fascism and revolutionary movements are inherently violent,
949520	954520	and how those political situations generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish.
954520	957520	What's harder to see is how the same tendency spills out at the seams
957520	960520	of our own supposedly humane society.
960520	963520	We think of the police as peacekeepers, not killers,
963520	965520	yet it's not unheard of that-
965520	966520	Oh.
966520	967520	Oh no.
967520	969520	Oh god.
969520	974520	Likewise, we think of our wars as liberation projects or humanitarian interventions,
974520	977520	but when you put real human beings in combat situations,
977520	979520	the nature of war has a way of just-
979520	980520	Oh.
980520	982520	Oh god.
982520	983520	No.
983520	985520	Fuck.
985520	988520	We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgement on sadism,
988520	992520	but sadistic violence isn't even necessarily the worst thing that can happen to people.
992520	996520	There's also the quieter structural injustices that lead to millions of people starving,
996520	1000520	or workers throwing themselves out of windows at the iPhone factory,
1000520	1004520	or the low-key normalization of sexual assault in supposedly civilized countries,
1004520	1007520	none of which requires so much as a single cackling maniac.
1007520	1009520	So in order to think about this intelligently,
1009520	1012520	we need to weigh the risk that revolutionary violence will spin out of control,
1012520	1014520	and lead to sadistic mayhem,
1014520	1018520	against the risk that our own complacency with the injustices of the status quo
1018520	1023520	will make us quiet enablers of more subtle but equally unjust forms of violence.
1023520	1026520	And I don't feel confident enough to say which one I think is the bigger risk,
1026520	1032520	but I do know I don't trust the politics of anyone who doesn't acknowledge the problems with both options.
1032520	1035520	So, in conclusion, is violence good?
1035520	1037520	Or is it bad?
1037520	1039520	I guess we'll never know.
1042520	1054520	You know, with any true philosophical question,
1054520	1058520	there always comes a point when you realize that all the rationalizations you tell yourself
1058520	1063520	for all the things you believe and do just don't really make any sense.
1063520	1066520	And that's when it's time to stop thinking about it, you know?
1066520	1068520	Just do the fucking laundry.
1068520	1070520	Drink some wine.
1070520	1072520	I don't know, do whatever.
1072520	1074520	Look, what do you want from me?
