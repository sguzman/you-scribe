00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
In color theory, the selection of colors used in a design is called a color scheme.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Analogous color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
while complementary schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Hi girls! I'm Tracy Mounts, guest host of ContraPoints,

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
the internet show where we talk about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,000
This week, we'll be talking about colors.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Colors! What the fuck are they?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
In one beaker I have white, in the other, brown.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Pour them together, and wow, I don't know what the kids are calling it.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's delicious!

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Now according to some so-called experts,

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
But what about the shadow illusion?

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Same wavelengths, different colors.

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Some people say I'm a man dressed as a lady,

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
but I'm actually a lady who used colors

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
to be a man dressed as a man dressed as a lady.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Explain that, Professor Butler.

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Illusion.

20
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
What matters more, the way things are or the way things look?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, um...

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
It's too early for this.

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Today, my guests are, um...

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Well, who are you people?

26
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'm Dr. Abigail Cockbane,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Associate Professor of Women's Studies and author of many, many books.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Most recently, my doctoral thesis,

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Sacred Passage, The Divine Feminine in Flux and Flow.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Oh, yes.

31
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
And, uh...

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Well, you look familiar. Who are you?

33
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Um...

34
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay, well...

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Today, my guests will be debating the topic...

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Um...

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Well, here's a good one.

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for a transgender?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
What do you think, Annabelle?

40
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Well, Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
begins with freedom of speech.

42
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
For instance, this cat person over here

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
is clearly a biological male in some sort of costume wig.

44
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes,

45
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
but the fact remains that pronouns refer,

46
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
But perhaps you disagree, sir.

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
That's a human rights violation!

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll smash your fucking face!

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And here we have a clear illustration

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
of the way that transgender ideology

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
is merely a smokescreen for male violence against women.

53
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
And mind you, this is being taught in our schools,

54
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
it's being forced on our children,

55
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
it's becoming mandatory...

56
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Security! Have this cat removed!

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The centers are being silenced,

58
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
and something must be done about the encroaching trans agenda

59
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
taking away women's rights,

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
invading women's spaces,

61
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
depriving us of what feminism has worked so hard to...

62
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I love a kitty queen,

63
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
but Abigail clocks a cat.

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Gender's just like color.

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Some people see yellow,

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
some people see blue.

67
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's all a matter of opinion.

68
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Or is it?

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's not.

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Let's hear the real tea.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Tabby.

72
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Sweetie.

73
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Baby.

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Princess.

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I feel ridiculous in this dress.

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Yeah, well you look ridiculous,

77
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
because you wouldn't take the goddamn cat of yours,

78
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
off.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I think I'm gonna take the dress off.

80
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Well, don't do that.

81
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm trying to help you out, girl.

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
If you don't want to get misgendered,

83
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
it helps to femme it up a little.

84
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm gonna take it off.

85
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Well, don't leave.

86
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You can change in front of me.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm not a prude.

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm gonna go behind the curtain.

89
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I like looking at naked people.

90
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Why do you always hit on me?

91
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I thought you were into men.

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Well, I swing both ways.

93
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I like boy dick and girl dick.

94
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's not how that works.

95
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I hate that.

96
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The heart wants what it wants.

97
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why did you invite me over here anyway?

98
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I saw what happened to you on the Freedom Report,

99
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and girl,

100
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
girl,

101
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you cannot be

102
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
a trans woman on TV

103
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
threatening people with a bat.

104
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You think it's morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors?

105
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
No, morally wrong.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What does that even mean?

107
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It was much worse than morally wrong.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It was aesthetically wrong.

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It was unfeminine.

110
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
This is all you ever say to me.

111
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's bad optics.

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's bad aesthetics.

113
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Well, does reality matter at all to you?

114
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Because the reality is I am a woman,

115
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't think I look like one,

116
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
but the way things look isn't all that matters.

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Tabby, this is politics.

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter?

119
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Reality plays no role in politics.

120
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Politics is aesthetics.

121
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Politics is aesthetics?

122
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
That's literally what fascism is.

123
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Have you even read Benjamin?

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Ugh.

125
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The military parades, the pageantry,

127
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and communism responds by politicizing art.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
This is what I can't stand about communists.

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You want to turn art into propaganda.

130
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Well, art is already ideology.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Ugh.

132
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Look, instead of ruining art,

133
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
why don't we fight the pageantry of fascism with pageantry of our own?

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
And you know who's gonna make that happen?

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Who?

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Well-funded trans women.

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Patreon's in the description.

138
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Ew. Stop that.

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
What?

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm just trying to monetize a connected engagement community

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
by strategically leveraging my content creator promotional media brand analytics.

142
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Is that so wrong?

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You're so bougie.

144
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm not the one quoting German philosophers from memory.

145
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Revolutionary philosophers.

146
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Whatever you need to tell yourself.

147
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Look, the point I'm trying to make is that the world we live in

148
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
is not a philosophical world.

149
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Think about Instagram.

150
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
It's all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle.

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
If you cry yourself to sleep every night, who cares?

152
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No one sees that.

153
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
They only see the show you're putting on.

154
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Okay, but life is not a show.

155
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mmm, politics is a show.

156
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Look around you, Tabby.

157
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Try to understand what's happening to the world.

158
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The president of the United States is a reality TV star.

159
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The 21st century is an aesthetic century.

160
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
In history, there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle.

161
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
And it's important to know which you're in.

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Our America, our internet, is not ancient Athens.

163
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It's Rome.

164
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
And your problem is you think you're in the forum

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
when you're really in the circus.

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent.

167
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Now you're against reason, too?

168
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm not against reason.

169
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Reason is a very powerful aesthetic.

170
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
If you're a man.

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
And what if you're a woman?

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh, don't be a woman.

173
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That's not a good idea.

174
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Ow.

175
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Do you remember that debate between Blair White and that YouTuber with the pink wig?

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What was her name?

177
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I don't know.

178
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
She was relevant back in 2017.

179
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Anyway, this was before she transitioned.

180
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
And in that debate, Blair looked like she had two X chromosomes.

181
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
And the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig not looking at the camera.

182
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I vaguely remember.

183
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Well, the pink wig lost that debate so badly.

185
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It was embarrassing to watch.

186
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Not really.

187
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I mean, she was right.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
And her arguments were better.

189
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Ah, Tabby.

190
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Sweetie.

191
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Honey.

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Angel.

193
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Darling.

194
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Princess.

195
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Baby.

196
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Arguments don't matter.

197
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
How pretty you are matters.

198
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is this really where you're going with this?

199
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Tabby, if you want to be a public figure, sooner or later you're gonna need to take the trans girl black pill.

200
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Oh boy.

201
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If you're a trans woman in the public eye, what matters is one thing and one thing only.

202
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And it's always been the thing that matters.

203
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What?

204
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
The realness.

205
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Verisimilitude.

206
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You have to look like a fucking woman.

207
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
There it is.

208
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There it is is right.

209
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
We don't say it in public, but we all know it and we all feel it.

210
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
What does it even mean to look like a woman?

211
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Oh, don't give me that PC bullshit.

212
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm trying to have a real conversation here.

213
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We all know what it means.

214
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I don't know what it means.

215
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Women have a lot of different looks.

216
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
There are bald women, bearded women, muscular women, wide-shouldered women.

217
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
And what is society's opinion about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?

218
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Is this just about you making me wear the dress again?

219
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The dress is the last of my concerns.

220
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I mean, where do I even start with this?

221
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
You're wearing combat boots.

222
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You cannot be wearing combat boots.

223
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why not?

224
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
A lot of cis women wear them.

225
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Cis women?

226
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Well, they're hopeless, aren't they?

227
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Fully clockable.

228
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
So you want me to look like a woman without imitating cis women?

229
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yes.

230
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Do not under any circumstances imitate cis women.

231
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
They have no idea what they're doing.

232
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well, where does your idea of womanhood even come from then?

233
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Das ewige Weibliche.

234
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The archetype of the eternal feminine.

235
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And where does that come from?

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Poets.

237
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Teenage gay boys on Instagram.

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The only people with any coherent vision of contemporary womanhood.

239
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's insanity.

240
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Is it?

241
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Tabby, look at my face.

242
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Look at this highlight.

243
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Does that look like the product of insanity to you?

244
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I mean, yeah, kind of.

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Who puts on that much makeup to drink tea at home?

246
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Good banter.

247
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well done.

248
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Trans women have to overdo it.

249
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You need to be so good at makeup that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice.

250
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You need to toss your hair and cross your legs.

251
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You need to smile even at people who hate you.

252
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Eliminate every aggressive impulse.

253
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream.

254
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Your hands are not tools.

255
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
They're ornaments at the ends of your arms.

256
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are.

257
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Literally a man's idea of a woman.

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Well, men have the power.

259
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Men make the rules.

260
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
And it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood.

261
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.

262
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.

263
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Not stereotypes.

264
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Performances.

265
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?

266
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Gender is performance.

267
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
We're all born naked and the rest is literally drag.

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Womanhood is not what you are.

269
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's what you do.

270
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
And trans women have to be virtuosas of womanhood.

271
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
So according to you, there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen.

272
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Now, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.

273
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not.

274
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I mean performance in the sense of everything you do.

275
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The way you style yourself.

276
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Your posture.

277
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The way you speak.

278
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
An authentic performance is just a habitual performance.

279
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
And nothing more than that.

280
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So, trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?

281
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like?

282
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You transition the same way you get anywhere in life.

283
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You fake it till you make it.

284
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
So according to you, a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
That's what any woman is.

286
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
What about gender non-conforming cis women?

287
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
They're not doing womanhood in that way.

288
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Well, yeah.

289
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
That's why those women are marginalized.

290
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood.

291
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And you don't want to end up like that, do you?

292
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
And hold on.

293
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman, talks like a woman, takes female hormones,

294
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
is gendered female by other people,

295
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,

296
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
that he's literally as much of a woman as we are?

297
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yep.

298
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's absurd.

299
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But it's absurd because the example is absurd.

300
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No cis man would do that.

301
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's like asking, is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men?

302
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Like, yeah, pretty much.

303
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
See, this is a philosophy at its worst.

304
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Pointless speculative fiction.

305
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about,

306
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
which is you getting rid of those combat boots.

307
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I thought we were talking about philosophy.

308
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No.

309
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
We're talking about shoes.

310
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you?

311
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You're apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends.

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The left will abide a regal queer.

313
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place.

314
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,

315
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?

316
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What matters is that we identify as women.

317
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
We can express that identity in different ways,

318
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.

319
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood.

320
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Without action, and without social recognition, the identity is meaningless.

321
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream,

322
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter,

323
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
because unless you're living womanhood, the identity is literally that meaningless.

324
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.

325
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Well, this isn't a Tumblr cuddle party, girl, I'm trying to talk about what's really true.

326
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I didn't say it was insensitive, I said it was unfair.

327
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Identifying as a woman before you transition

328
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,000
is a psychological reality that implies a potential to live your inner truth.

329
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter, it's just a troll example.

330
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
True, but even if they were sincere, there would still be no reality to it,

331
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
because helicopter is not an actual social role.

332
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Whereas, you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman,

333
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
but you have to work to get there, and ultimately, society has to let you.

334
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
What do you mean?

335
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses,

336
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
but if no one recognizes me as a doctor, then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?

337
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment.

338
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
All it takes is being misgendered.

339
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in?

340
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Why did you get so angry when that TERF called you sir?

341
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Isn't it because, in that situation, she robbed you of your womanhood?

342
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
That's ridiculous. I am a woman. That's my reality.

343
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.

344
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I know you're a woman, I'm just saying that in that one moment,

345
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
you effectively had your gender cancelled.

346
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Another way of looking at it is, gender is aesthetic, not rational.

347
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't.

348
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
There's no reasoning your way into it.

349
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Oh, don't worry about that. I don't argue I'm a woman.

350
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I smash.

351
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I know you do. And it's a bad look.

352
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Is this about the shoes again?

353
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Yep. Here, put these on.

354
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Absolutely not. I'm not wearing those.

355
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Yes you are, bitch.

356
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Nope.

357
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
If you put these on, I'll, um,

358
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
scratch you behind the ears,

359
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
years later.

360
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Okay, fine.

361
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Now walk.

362
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Ugh.

363
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
That was the worst thing I've ever seen.

364
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Well, you're the one who made me do it.

365
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Look, don't stomp around like that.

366
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Keep your shoulders back and steady.

367
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
All the movement comes from your hips.

368
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
And you want to put the weight on the balls of your feet.

369
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Here, I'll show you.

370
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Your turn. Do it right.

371
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
The category is...

372
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Catgirls.

373
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Yes, bitch!

374
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
That was flawless. It was iconic.

375
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm living for this. I'm loving this for you.

376
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
You're doing so good for yourself.

377
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Ugh, I'm never doing that again.

378
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Ugh! Why not?

379
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Because it's not who I am.

380
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
All your advice is just trying to turn me into you.

381
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Well, that's not what aesthetics is.

382
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.

383
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
And I'll only ever be a second-rate Justine.

384
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But I can be a first-rate Tabby.

385
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Well, kids, this week we learned a valuable lesson

386
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
about the importance of being yourself.

387
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Shut up!

388
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Look, I know I'm not cool, okay?

389
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I know I'm not pretty.

390
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And I know you think you're too good for me

391
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
because you mostly pass.

392
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back.

393
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
People stare at me because I'm a transgender furry,

394
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
and that's weird.

395
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I'm a fucking queer icon

396
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
because I'm not like you.

397
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Because I'm not like anyone but myself.

398
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And because I'm willing to stand up to the people who oppress us.

399
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
And I'm willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow

400
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and deep voices

401
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
that girls even other trans women make fun of.

402
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
And when in the history of the world

403
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
has anyone but me ever stood up for them?

404
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
That's why I'm here.

405
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Everyone knows who Tabby is.

406
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?

407
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Wow, Tabby, I didn't know you had that in you.

408
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
But so what?

409
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
So male-to-anime Twitter stans you.

410
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Big deal.

411
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
You're mad, aren't you?

412
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I'll get over it in a few weeks.

413
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Look, you're right.

414
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
You have to be yourself.

415
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Trying to be someone else is always a bad look.

416
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic,

417
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
then wear them well and make it work.

418
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
But sometimes being yourself is not enough.

419
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Sometimes you have to become

420
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
yourself.

421
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
And for you,

422
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I think that means that the smashing has got to stop.

423
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I mean, with the Nazis it's one thing,

424
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat.

425
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I wouldn't have to smash if literally anyone else

426
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
were willing to stick up for us.

427
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Your delicate notion of femininity

428
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
is a product of the privilege you share

429
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
with a lot of thin white cis feminists.

430
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Wow.

431
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
It must be so hard for you out on the streets

432
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
as a fat woman of color.

433
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Shut up.

434
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm just saying,

435
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
don't claim a struggle that isn't yours, girl.

436
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You could have what I have,

437
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
you just have to work for it

438
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
instead of playing this part of the tragic victim.

439
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You were raised a white boy.

440
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy.

441
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
And yeah,

442
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
it's hard being a trans woman of any background,

443
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
but you still stand on a lot of privilege.

444
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I look at all the photos of trans women

445
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
who are murdered in this country,

446
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and they don't look like you or me.

447
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why don't you use your privilege

448
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
and use your education

449
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
to actually do some good in the world

450
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
instead of this elective, revolutionary LARPing?

451
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You make me sound like the self-indulgent one.

452
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I'm sorry I'm not hardworking enough

453
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties

454
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
with transphobes.

455
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I've seen minds change

456
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
and hearts soften before my eyes.

457
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
You don't win friends and allies with a bat.

458
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
They're just using you.

459
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Well, who do you think benefits?

460
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And who do you think gets hurt

461
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
when you go out into the world

462
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
and represent trans women as masculine and violent?

463
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Who do you think benefits

464
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
when they trot you out

465
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?

466
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I guess we can't win, can we?

467
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You want to just chill out

468
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
and watch YouTube videos?

469
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Yeah, okay.

470
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Forget about the disrespect.

471
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Facts don't care about your feelings.

472
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It turns out

473
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
that every chromosome,

474
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
every cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body

475
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
is male with the exception

476
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
of some of his sperm cells.

477
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
You don't know what you're talking about.

478
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
You're not educated on genetics.

479
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Would you actually like to discuss the genetics?

480
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
What are your genetics?

481
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You cut that out now

482
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
or you'll go home in an ambulance.

483
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate

484
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
for a political discussion.

485
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
You cut that out now

486
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
or you'll go home in an ambulance.

487
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
So I look at that

488
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
and I feel like on my end

489
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
it's like I'm always,

490
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I feel like I'm always damage controlling

491
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
for the trans community,

492
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
which is so frustrating.

493
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
You'll go home in an ambulance.

494
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Damage controlling.

495
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
So frustrating.

496
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You'll go home in an ambulance.

497
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Facts don't care about your feelings.

498
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
So frustrating.

499
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You'll go home in an ambulance.

500
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
It's imperative

501
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
that we actually use terms

502
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
that refer to something.

503
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
If you want to talk about

504
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
gender as distinct from sex

505
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
and then talk about

506
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
you're a very feminine biological man,

507
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
you know,

508
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
and you've had surgeries to prove it,

509
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
then I think that we can talk about

510
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
what is the appropriate pronoun to use.

511
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
My problem is the...

512
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Tabby, I don't want to fight with you.

513
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We're surviving in this shit world together

514
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and you'll always be my sister.

515
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Well, I'm glad.

516
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I love you.

517
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
What?

518
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Love.

519
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I was in love once.

520
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I was in a smoky roadhouse

521
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
outside Cincinnati

522
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
bent over a pool table.

523
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
The year was 1985.

524
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
And to this day,

525
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
when the perfume of cheap whiskey

526
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
hits my nostrils

527
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
at just the right moment,

528
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
I can almost feel

529
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
the beer-stained billiard cloth

530
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
against my cheek.

531
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Let's watch it all on VHS

532
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
cassette to learn more.

533
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If tonight is the night

534
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
that I'm going to dance

535
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
While the lasers are high

536
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
in our visions of love

537
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
As we reach for the sky

538
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
this is all that we know

539
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I don't remember a single lie

540
