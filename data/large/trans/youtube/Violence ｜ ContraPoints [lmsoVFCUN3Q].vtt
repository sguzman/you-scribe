WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:55.680
so why is it that humans just can't stop killing each other well i don't know what do i look like

00:55.680 --> 01:02.080
you some kind of philosopher so look thrasimachus this is a question for god and the prophets

01:02.080 --> 01:05.360
not for preening transsexuals who can't get out of bed without a bloody mary

01:07.200 --> 01:12.080
however if i were to make a modest contribution to the subject i would humbly offer up the

01:12.080 --> 01:17.840
hypothesis that humans are horrible to each other because well violence is fun

01:20.400 --> 01:25.120
and when i say that i of course mean that it's fun to be violent it's not fun when other people

01:25.120 --> 01:33.760
are violent to you i mean unless that's what you're into that is what i'm into

01:33.760 --> 01:37.360
did i say you could speak no mistress then shut up

01:55.120 --> 01:59.520
you're so so boring

02:06.800 --> 02:10.100
this is the story of great man and great woman

02:11.680 --> 02:18.000
mmm that's good chocolatey stanley kubrick's a clockwork orange is very uncomfortable to watch

02:18.000 --> 02:21.520
and not just because it depicts horrible acts of violence most of the movies i like depict

02:21.520 --> 02:25.120
horrible acts of violence i mean if you're gonna watch a non-violent movie you may as well read a

02:25.120 --> 02:29.380
perspective of the sadistic protagonist a jaunty rapist who likes to sing and

02:29.380 --> 02:33.340
dance as he tortures and humiliates his victims. What's creepy about Alex is the

02:33.340 --> 02:37.420
film encourages us to identify with him and he kind of draws us in. I mean he

02:37.420 --> 02:41.860
listens to Beethoven and I personally am attracted to every man who has ever

02:41.860 --> 02:47.860
liked German composers. Also he tries the wine. Try the watch! So we watch Alex kick

02:47.860 --> 02:51.820
and spin and smash things and beat the shit out of homeless people and bash

02:51.820 --> 02:55.340
old ladies in the face with giant sculptures of dicks and all of this to

02:55.340 --> 02:59.620
triumphant classical music and show tunes. It's clear that for Alex this is

02:59.620 --> 03:03.940
all a lot of fun. So the question I want to ask is how unusual are people like

03:03.940 --> 03:08.540
this in real life? How normal is it to enjoy violence? I mean extremely violent

03:08.540 --> 03:11.980
behavior is uncommon but part of that might be that most of us live in

03:11.980 --> 03:16.400
political circumstances where behaving like a violent maniac is highly frowned

03:16.400 --> 03:20.560
upon. And there's also that tedious old thing called having some semblance of a

03:20.560 --> 03:21.580
moral conscience.

03:21.580 --> 03:21.780
And I think that's one of the reasons why I'm so excited about this film.

03:21.780 --> 03:21.800
And I think that's one of the reasons why I'm so excited about this film.

03:21.800 --> 03:25.240
And I think that's part of the reason why a lot of people don't really enjoy

03:25.240 --> 03:28.880
watching a clockwork orange. It's not that they don't enjoy violence, it's that

03:28.880 --> 03:32.360
in order for them to enjoy violence they need some kind of reassurance that the

03:32.360 --> 03:36.040
violence is okay and that enjoying it is morally and socially allowed.

03:40.460 --> 03:44.080
I guess it's kind of like sex. I'm not gonna want to have sex in a fluorescent

03:44.080 --> 03:47.900
lit bathroom stall. At least not since I started taking this shit. I need

03:47.900 --> 03:51.560
candlelight to get me in the mood you know. A little goddamn ambience. And you

03:51.560 --> 03:55.820
could say that the moral conscience is the fluorescent lit bathroom stall of the

03:55.820 --> 04:00.180
human mind. You can't properly enjoy violence with all that internal nagging

04:00.180 --> 04:04.320
going on in the background. But in that case, what is the romantic candlelight of

04:04.320 --> 04:07.900
the sadistic psyche? What do we need to get to a place where we can enjoy

04:07.900 --> 04:13.100
violence? Well, think about the TV show Law and Order SVU, which has just as much

04:13.100 --> 04:17.560
sex and violence as a clockwork orange, but which is much more popular. SVU is a

04:17.560 --> 04:21.400
show where hero cops with no regard for due process brutally interrogate

04:21.400 --> 04:25.120
suspected sex offenders and smash them in the face with wooden drawers.

04:27.220 --> 04:32.080
You like that, don't you? I love it so much. You all do. I think a lot of the

04:32.080 --> 04:35.520
appeal of SVU is that it gives upstanding American citizens a way to

04:35.520 --> 04:39.540
sate their curiosity about heinous sex crimes while promising the moral

04:39.540 --> 04:44.500
purification of justified police violence. Oh, so that promise is the

04:44.500 --> 04:48.620
candlelit ambience of the moral psyche. When we believe that violence is morally

04:48.620 --> 04:51.100
justified, we think the guy being thrown around the

04:51.400 --> 04:55.800
interrogation room fucking deserved it, we become capable of enjoying it aesthetically.

04:55.800 --> 05:00.300
Exactly! And I think this kind of moral lampshading partly explains the popularity

05:00.300 --> 05:05.380
of rape-revenge plotlines you see in movies like Kill Bill, The Crow, and Curious George

05:05.380 --> 05:09.860
Kills the Rapist. For viewers with too many moral hangups to get off on totally senseless

05:09.860 --> 05:14.800
violence, a rape-revenge plotline is a cheap way to establish the emotional precedent required

05:14.800 --> 05:16.880
for gratifying bloody payoff.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.260
wonder if there may not be as much of a psychological difference between the good person's enjoyment

05:21.260 --> 05:25.620
of justified violence and the evil sadist's enjoyment of random violence as we might like

05:25.620 --> 05:26.620
to think.

05:26.620 --> 05:31.040
Yes, the good person has a moral conscience as a kind of inhibitive influence, but once

05:31.040 --> 05:37.640
you get past that, there's a kind of amoral kinetic rapture and swinging, thrashing, stabbing,

05:37.640 --> 05:42.660
shooting, blasting, and burning, an aesthetics of violence and destruction.

05:42.660 --> 05:47.200
Now I for one hardly ever enjoy real-world violence because I empathize with the victim

05:47.200 --> 05:49.780
and my conscience vetoes any enjoyment of it.

05:49.780 --> 05:52.100
I mean, unless I get real frustrated.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.100
Shut up.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.100
Please, just shut up.

05:54.100 --> 05:55.100
Oh, it's so noisy.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.100
I can't think straight.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.100
You're so filthy.

05:57.100 --> 05:58.100
It's time to drink your milk.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.100
Just...

05:59.100 --> 06:00.100
Mmm.

06:00.100 --> 06:01.100
Mmm.

06:01.100 --> 06:02.100
Mmm.

06:02.100 --> 06:03.100
Mmm.

06:03.100 --> 06:04.100
Mmm.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.100
Mmm.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.100
Mmm.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.100
Mmm.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.100
Mmm.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.100
Mmm.

06:09.100 --> 06:10.100
Mmm.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.100
Mmm.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.100
Mmm.

06:12.100 --> 06:12.600
Mmm.

06:12.600 --> 06:12.640
Mmm.

06:12.640 --> 06:13.140
Mmm.

06:13.140 --> 06:13.640
Mmm.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.140
Mmm.

06:14.140 --> 06:14.640
Mmm.

06:14.640 --> 06:15.140
Mmm.

06:15.140 --> 06:15.640
Mmm.

06:15.640 --> 06:16.140
Mmm.

06:16.140 --> 06:16.640
Mmm.

06:16.640 --> 06:17.140
Mmm.

06:17.140 --> 06:17.640
Mmm.

06:17.640 --> 06:18.140
Mmm.

06:18.140 --> 06:18.640
Mmm.

06:18.640 --> 06:19.140
Mmm.

06:19.140 --> 06:19.640
Mmm.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.140
Mmm.

06:20.140 --> 06:20.640
Mmm.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.640
But you know, when I'm playing video games and there are no moral or practical consequences

06:24.640 --> 06:28.640
to any of my actions, I behave like an absolute goddamn psychopath.

06:28.640 --> 06:34.100
I guess that a simulation of a thing being fun doesn't mean that the thing itself is

06:34.100 --> 06:35.100
fun.

06:35.100 --> 06:42.580
I mean, The Sims is a simulation of life, and that's fun, but life itself... is terrible.

06:42.580 --> 06:58.120
Bye-bye,

06:58.120 --> 07:03.660
everyone!

07:03.660 --> 07:07.580
BYE!

07:07.580 --> 07:09.960
To be clear, that was a joke, not a cry for help.

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
I'm actually FINE.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.520
I have TONS of friends!

07:12.520 --> 07:17.520
I'm fine. I'm really- I'm fine. I'M HAPPY, OKAY?

07:17.520 --> 07:27.520
Here's what I want to know. Unless violence is fun on some basic level, why are simulations of it so fun that the gameplay of most video games is based entirely around it?

07:27.520 --> 07:34.520
Some critics have suggested that this is simply toxic masculinity at work, and that it's a patriarchal moral defect that our media is so violent.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.520
And yeah, it's true that men are mostly responsible for this, granted.

07:38.520 --> 07:47.520
But honestly, I feel a little bit infantilized by the moral critique, since I like violent media, and I feel like I can tell the difference between real and fictional violence.

07:47.520 --> 07:51.520
Although sometimes the distinction between real and simulated violence can get blurry.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.520
...that I usually like to think.

07:53.520 --> 08:01.520
Little baby, don't you cry. Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.520
Joshua Oppenheimer's disturbing documentary, The Act of Killing,

08:06.520 --> 08:08.520
chronicles the contemporary lives of the East.

08:08.520 --> 08:14.520
It's about the Indonesian gangsters who massacred millions of alleged communists from 1965 to 1966.

08:14.520 --> 08:22.520
One of the killers, Anwar Kongo, explains on a local television program that his torture and murder methods were inspired by sadistic American movies.

08:22.520 --> 08:28.520
With their own methods, we see each other as if we were the mafia.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.520
When he was on the road, he was in the middle of the motorbike, tied up with a rope.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.520
When he was ready, he threw it away.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.520
At night, waiting for the night to come, we threw it away.

08:36.520 --> 08:38.520
The documentary takes a surreal perspective.

08:38.520 --> 08:43.520
It takes a surreal turn as the original perpetrator is set to work producing cinematic reenactments of their youthful war crimes,

08:43.520 --> 08:47.520
stylizing the events after westerns, mafia films, and other Hollywood genres.

08:47.520 --> 08:50.520
It's a particularly uncomfortable case of life imitating art.

08:50.520 --> 08:56.520
And on that topic, Stanley Kubrick had a clockwork orange withdrawn from British distribution in 1973,

08:56.520 --> 08:59.520
after the film was alleged to have influenced a handful of real-life assaults.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.520
Now I'm not saying that violent movies make people violent,

09:02.520 --> 09:06.520
and we know that most consumers of violent media never commit acts of violence themselves.

09:06.520 --> 09:10.520
I mean, I watch violent movies all the time, and I've never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.

09:12.520 --> 09:16.520
So now, woke ContraPoints thinks child abuse is funny.

09:16.520 --> 09:20.520
I personally drowned several of my babies, and it was very traumatic for me.

09:20.520 --> 09:23.520
Why did I become an SJW again?

09:23.520 --> 09:29.520
Hey, what I want to know is what's the difference between fans of violent movies who are peaceful and those who are sadistic killers?

09:29.520 --> 09:34.520
Well, who better to ask than an Indonesian gangster with a thousand dead communists under his belt?

09:36.520 --> 09:39.520
Killing people is the most serious crime.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.520
But how do we...

09:43.520 --> 09:44.520
How do we...

09:44.520 --> 09:49.520
Genoa still considers what you're doing to be a serious crime.

09:49.520 --> 09:53.520
We don't necessarily agree with the International Court of Justice, as I said earlier.

09:53.520 --> 09:57.520
So it could be that the Genoa Convention is also the truth now.

09:57.520 --> 09:58.520
The Genoa Convention.

09:58.520 --> 10:00.520
Tomorrow there's the Jakarta Convention.

10:00.520 --> 10:02.520
We'll throw away the Genoa Convention.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.520
So in other words, as long as you can justify it to yourself

10:04.520 --> 10:06.520
with some kind of flimsy excuse,

10:06.520 --> 10:08.520
you can kill without remorse.

10:08.520 --> 10:12.520
And I imagine it also helps when the US-backed government of your country endorses the killing

10:12.520 --> 10:14.520
and you never have to face any consequences for it.

10:14.520 --> 10:19.520
What's interesting to me is that the sadistic enjoyment of violence is psychologically identical,

10:19.520 --> 10:23.520
whether or not your justification rationally holds up or makes any sense.

10:23.520 --> 10:27.520
In other words, the psychology of a righteous sadist may not differ from that of an evil sadist,

10:27.520 --> 10:30.520
except that the former happens to have better reasons backing him up,

10:30.520 --> 10:32.520
or lives in a better political situation.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.520
But hold on, is there even such a thing as a righteous sadist?

10:35.520 --> 10:37.520
I think it's okay to enjoy violent movies,

10:37.520 --> 10:40.520
but is it ever not bad to enjoy real violence?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.520
What would be helpful here is an example,

10:42.520 --> 10:45.520
some act of violence that my audience thinks is righteous,

10:45.520 --> 10:47.520
and that a lot of them probably even enjoy.

10:47.520 --> 10:50.520
Unfortunately, my audience is morally superior,

10:50.520 --> 10:52.520
and none of them would ever enjoy

11:01.520 --> 11:04.520
ContraPoints has completely leapt out

11:04.520 --> 11:10.520
and can't stop wringing your hands over a poor little Nazi getting hit in the face.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.520
Awww.

11:11.520 --> 11:14.520
Alright, alright, let's grant that punching a Nazi is morally acceptable.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
Let's say it's morally required, even.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.520
Well, why don't we try to bring everyone on board?

11:18.520 --> 11:21.520
Suppose there's a Nazi TERF and he's about to punch a baby,

11:21.520 --> 11:25.520
and punching the TERF Nazi is the only way to stop him from punching the baby.

11:25.520 --> 11:28.520
Socrates, is it just to punch the baby puncher?

11:28.520 --> 11:31.520
ContraPoint sponsors would like to apologize to the baby community

11:31.520 --> 11:33.520
for this video's ongoing trivialization and infanticide.

11:34.520 --> 11:37.520
They'd also like you to know that some of Natalie's best friends are babies,

11:37.520 --> 11:39.520
and they all think babies should just learn to take a joke.

11:39.520 --> 11:43.520
Why are we even still talking about this over-discussed Nazi-punching bullshit?

11:43.520 --> 11:47.520
I guess part of it is that it's the only recent example of actual far-left violence in America

11:47.520 --> 11:49.520
that anyone seems to be able to dig up.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.520
Not for long, bourgeois dogs!

11:52.520 --> 11:55.520
Catgirls of the world, unite!

11:55.520 --> 11:59.520
Tabby, could you bring it down just 27 notches or so?

12:02.520 --> 12:03.520
Why don't you take a second to relax?

12:03.520 --> 12:05.520
Just chill out a little bit.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.520
Here, have some spiked milk.

12:17.520 --> 12:20.520
That is having a very interesting effect on her.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.520
I guess my continued uneasiness with leftist punching discourse,

12:23.520 --> 12:26.520
whether it's Nazis or TERFs or whatever, is twofold.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.520
First, there's the optics problem.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.520
We want to convince people that, for instance,

12:31.520 --> 12:34.520
trans women are not creepy men who want to assault cis women.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.520
And I can't help but wonder, is the slogan,

12:36.520 --> 12:41.520
kill all TERFs, really the most effective way to convey that message?

12:42.520 --> 12:46.520
And I realize the costume I'm wearing is not the best for making this point either.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.520
But, you know, I just didn't plan well.

12:49.520 --> 12:53.520
The other worry has to do with when violence stops being strategic

12:53.520 --> 12:57.520
and starts being fun, as in our collective enjoyment of the Richard Spencer punch.

12:57.520 --> 13:00.520
Because then it's not just that we're saying sometimes preemptive violence is necessary

13:00.520 --> 13:02.520
to prevent worse crimes.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.520
It's that we're actively fucking enjoying it.

13:04.520 --> 13:08.520
And any time real violence becomes fun, that's a little alarming,

13:08.520 --> 13:10.520
because even if your actions are genuinely justified,

13:10.520 --> 13:13.520
you don't want to get in the habit of enjoying real violence,

13:13.520 --> 13:16.520
because the violence will continue to be fun,

13:16.520 --> 13:18.520
whether or not your justifications are any good.

13:18.520 --> 13:22.520
Though I agree there's something sort of inherently liberal about this anti-sadism hang-up.

13:22.520 --> 13:26.520
For most of history, it was just accepted that war involves a certain amount of rape and pillage,

13:26.520 --> 13:29.520
and that executions were entertaining public spectacles.

13:29.520 --> 13:33.520
As a boring French postmodernist called Michael Foucault pointed out,

13:33.520 --> 13:37.520
in the 18th and 19th centuries, there was a so-called humanitarian revolution

13:37.520 --> 13:41.520
that was suddenly ashamed of overt sadism with respect to criminal justice

13:41.520 --> 13:44.520
and treatment of the mentally ill, replacing brutal executions

13:44.520 --> 13:46.520
with intricate techniques of discipline.

13:46.520 --> 13:50.520
And a boring French communist called Alain Badiou

13:50.520 --> 13:54.520
argued that this contemporary ethics based on pity and tolerance

13:54.520 --> 13:57.520
is actually just fucking neoliberal bullshit

13:57.520 --> 14:02.520
that encourages first-world people to stage third-world humanitarian interventions

14:02.520 --> 14:04.520
that look a lot like invasions for some reason,

14:04.520 --> 14:06.520
as well as opposing genuine liberation movements

14:06.520 --> 14:09.520
on the grounds that such movements amount to violent ideology,

14:09.520 --> 14:10.520
the bourgeois liberals claim.

14:10.520 --> 14:14.520
So I guess in a sense, my weird hang-up about violence benefits the people in power,

14:14.520 --> 14:17.520
since you have to break a few eggs to make a communist utopia,

14:17.520 --> 14:19.520
and sometimes to make political progress,

14:19.520 --> 14:21.520
you have to tar and feather some folks,

14:21.520 --> 14:23.520
and cut their heads off just a little bit,

14:23.520 --> 14:25.520
or punch them in the fucking face.

14:25.520 --> 14:27.520
Now I realize all the non-leftists watching this

14:27.520 --> 14:29.520
are absolutely horrified right now,

14:29.520 --> 14:30.520
and they're thinking,

14:30.520 --> 14:34.520
what's to stop your violent revolution from becoming just as bloodthirsty and unjust

14:34.520 --> 14:36.520
as those Indonesian gangsters killing communists?

14:36.520 --> 14:37.520
To which I respond,

14:37.520 --> 14:38.520
well, that's an easy one.

14:38.520 --> 14:40.520
It's because my side are the good people,

14:40.520 --> 14:41.520
and your side are the bad people.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
I'm so sorry.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.520
Seriously though, that is a pretty good question.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.520
Why don't I change the subject

14:46.520 --> 14:49.520
to avoid how much of a problem it is for the argument I'm making?

14:49.520 --> 14:51.520
Isn't all politics kind of violent?

14:51.520 --> 14:53.520
What about capitalism?

14:53.520 --> 14:56.520
Politics is the practice of organizing groups of human beings,

14:56.520 --> 15:00.520
and it's the relations of power that maintain or disrupt that organization.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.520
So there's always violence or the threat of violence in there somewhere.

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
In our own society,

15:04.520 --> 15:07.520
police will use violence against us if we disobey the law,

15:07.520 --> 15:08.520
or are black.

15:08.520 --> 15:10.520
And even when white people do obey the law,

15:10.520 --> 15:13.520
there's always the implicit threat of police violence,

15:13.520 --> 15:15.520
including the potential arrest and incarceration

15:15.520 --> 15:18.520
of pretty much every citizen who doesn't have enough money to-

15:19.520 --> 15:22.520
Let's talk about Western values.

15:22.520 --> 15:25.520
According to the great tradition of European political thought,

15:25.520 --> 15:28.520
sovereign power is justified by the social contract.

15:28.520 --> 15:32.520
In other words, we all consent to be governed because it's in our own interest.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.520
Except it's really hypothetical consent more than anything,

15:35.520 --> 15:37.520
because no one actually asks you,

15:37.520 --> 15:39.520
and you can't say no.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.520
Wait a minute.

15:42.520 --> 15:45.520
I guess if you live in a liberal capitalist society,

15:45.520 --> 15:49.520
it's pretty easy to see how fascism and revolutionary movements are inherently violent,

15:49.520 --> 15:54.520
and how those political situations generate conditions where violent sadism can flourish.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.520
What's harder to see is how the same tendency spills out at the seams

15:57.520 --> 16:00.520
of our own supposedly humane society.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.520
We think of the police as peacekeepers, not killers,

16:03.520 --> 16:05.520
yet it's not unheard of that-

16:05.520 --> 16:06.520
Oh.

16:06.520 --> 16:07.520
Oh no.

16:07.520 --> 16:09.520
Oh god.

16:09.520 --> 16:14.520
Likewise, we think of our wars as liberation projects or humanitarian interventions,

16:14.520 --> 16:17.520
but when you put real human beings in combat situations,

16:17.520 --> 16:19.520
the nature of war has a way of just-

16:19.520 --> 16:20.520
Oh.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.520
Oh god.

16:22.520 --> 16:23.520
No.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.520
Fuck.

16:25.520 --> 16:28.520
We tend to pass particularly harsh moral judgement on sadism,

16:28.520 --> 16:32.520
but sadistic violence isn't even necessarily the worst thing that can happen to people.

16:32.520 --> 16:36.520
There's also the quieter structural injustices that lead to millions of people starving,

16:36.520 --> 16:40.520
or workers throwing themselves out of windows at the iPhone factory,

16:40.520 --> 16:44.520
or the low-key normalization of sexual assault in supposedly civilized countries,

16:44.520 --> 16:47.520
none of which requires so much as a single cackling maniac.

16:47.520 --> 16:49.520
So in order to think about this intelligently,

16:49.520 --> 16:52.520
we need to weigh the risk that revolutionary violence will spin out of control,

16:52.520 --> 16:54.520
and lead to sadistic mayhem,

16:54.520 --> 16:58.520
against the risk that our own complacency with the injustices of the status quo

16:58.520 --> 17:03.520
will make us quiet enablers of more subtle but equally unjust forms of violence.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.520
And I don't feel confident enough to say which one I think is the bigger risk,

17:06.520 --> 17:12.520
but I do know I don't trust the politics of anyone who doesn't acknowledge the problems with both options.

17:12.520 --> 17:15.520
So, in conclusion, is violence good?

17:15.520 --> 17:17.520
Or is it bad?

17:17.520 --> 17:19.520
I guess we'll never know.

17:22.520 --> 17:34.520
You know, with any true philosophical question,

17:34.520 --> 17:38.520
there always comes a point when you realize that all the rationalizations you tell yourself

17:38.520 --> 17:43.520
for all the things you believe and do just don't really make any sense.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.520
And that's when it's time to stop thinking about it, you know?

17:46.520 --> 17:48.520
Just do the fucking laundry.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.520
Drink some wine.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.520
I don't know, do whatever.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.520
Look, what do you want from me?

18:22.520 --> 18:24.520
proof valuable

18:24.520 --> 18:41.520
where person is going round the world

18:41.520 --> 18:43.520
proof valuable

18:43.520 --> 18:45.520
chance to turn

18:45.520 --> 18:48.520
thesis and I's a meat

18:48.520 --> 18:50.520
proof valuable

18:50.520 --> 18:51.520
where person is going round the world

18:51.520 --> 18:52.520
proof valuable

18:52.520 --> 19:22.500
Thank you for watching!
