00:00.000 --> 00:20.460
Okay. Let's get started. I literally need a man. I need a man. Help! Alright, I'm gonna

00:20.460 --> 00:29.520
get pliers. The lesbian solution. Okay. Let's get started.

00:38.740 --> 00:43.200
I love my king. This is not really the most feminine moment for me. Not really my

00:43.200 --> 00:48.080
2020 vibe, but it does proportionize my giant man hands.

00:48.360 --> 00:49.840
Meow, meow, meow.

00:49.840 --> 00:54.000
Alright, no one thinks I'm cute. Let's get started. Okay, look, this video is about

00:54.000 --> 01:00.140
canceling, also known as cancel culture, formerly known as call-out culture. And I know you kids

01:00.140 --> 01:05.920
know all about this, but before we dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow boomers.

01:06.160 --> 01:11.800
So listen up, oldies. In the lingo of these young, avocado-guzzling, smartphone addicts

01:11.800 --> 01:18.320
who killed Applebee's, canceling is online shaming, vilifying, and ostracizing of prominent

01:18.320 --> 01:19.780
members of a community by

01:19.780 --> 01:24.020
other members of that community. Like so much internet slang, this use of the word

01:24.020 --> 01:30.620
canceling started out on black Twitter, where a few years ago, people, well, mostly women,

01:30.940 --> 01:35.220
would tweet, cancel R. Kelly, and things like that. You know, it started out as this vigilante

01:35.220 --> 01:40.560
strategy for bringing justice and accountability to powerful people who previously had been

01:40.560 --> 01:42.860
immune to any consequences for their actions.

01:43.200 --> 01:49.340
For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media shaming to topple sexually abusive men in power,

01:49.780 --> 01:56.580
who couldn't be held accountable any other way. The promise of canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none,

01:56.580 --> 02:04.920
and bring justice to prominent abusers. It's in a way, the 21st century version of the guillotine, the bringer of justice, the people's avenger.

02:04.920 --> 02:17.320
But also like the guillotine, it can become a sadistic entertainment spectacle. And I want to make the case that we do have, well, a teensy bit of a Reign of Terror situation on our hands, Gorg.

02:17.320 --> 02:21.520
Now, there's a version of this conversation that's already been had to death, and it goes like this.

02:21.620 --> 02:27.040
On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly bitch about how cancel culture is out of control.

02:27.300 --> 02:31.560
You can't joke about anything anymore without these millennial jackals trying to get you in trouble.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.180
And the other side is mostly progressive think piece authors who argue that there's no such thing as cancel culture,

02:37.520 --> 02:42.580
it's just that powerful people are finally being held accountable for their actions, and they can't fucking handle it,

02:42.600 --> 02:46.900
so they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now, unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints,

02:47.320 --> 02:52.820
is quite as correct as some people might hope. So it's a good thing I'm here to deliver the truth.

02:52.820 --> 02:54.820
He didn't know I was transgender.

02:54.820 --> 02:56.820
Story time. Emotional, not clickbait.

02:56.820 --> 03:02.820
Let's start with an example. The most high-profile YouTube canceling of 2019 was the canceling of James Charles.

03:02.820 --> 03:08.320
And again, I know you kids remember this, but I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.320
Put the kettle on, Karen.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.320
So James Charles is a 20-year-old beauty guru, which means, um, boomers.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.320
Look, there's these people,

03:17.320 --> 03:19.320
who make YouTube videos,

03:19.320 --> 03:21.320
teaching you how to do makeup.

03:21.320 --> 03:25.320
It's worth checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer.

03:25.320 --> 03:27.320
I certainly can't.

03:27.320 --> 03:29.320
It's pretty bomb. It's lit. It's, uh,

03:29.320 --> 03:31.320
it's groovy. It's fab. It's far out, man.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.320
It's a gas. I fully dig it.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.320
Free love. Give peace a chance.

03:35.320 --> 03:37.320
Nixon's a fascist.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.320
So back in May of this year, James's colleague and

03:39.320 --> 03:41.320
mother figure?

03:41.320 --> 03:44.320
Fellow YouTube beauty guru Tati Westbrook

03:44.320 --> 03:46.320
uploaded a 40-minute video

03:46.320 --> 03:49.320
accusing James of endorsing

03:49.320 --> 03:51.320
a different brand of hair vitamins

03:51.320 --> 03:54.320
than the brand that she,

03:54.320 --> 03:57.320
wait, that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins.

03:57.320 --> 04:00.320
An enthralling plotline, I know.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.320
And this was huge. This was covered in the New York Times.

04:03.320 --> 04:05.320
And while Tati was at it,

04:05.320 --> 04:07.320
almost as an afterthought to the, uh,

04:07.320 --> 04:09.320
hair vitamin dispute,

04:09.320 --> 04:11.320
she also accused James of being

04:11.320 --> 04:14.320
a sexual predator.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.320
Now, I actually went back and checked

04:16.320 --> 04:18.320
Tati's original deleted video,

04:18.320 --> 04:21.320
and she actually never uses the phrase

04:21.320 --> 04:22.320
sexual predator.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.320
It's funny, I remember her calling him that

04:24.320 --> 04:27.320
because that became the story on Twitter.

04:27.320 --> 04:29.320
But what she actually said was

04:29.320 --> 04:32.320
James had tried to trick straight men

04:32.320 --> 04:34.320
into thinking they're gay.

04:34.320 --> 04:36.320
Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man

04:36.320 --> 04:39.320
into thinking he's gay yet again.

04:39.320 --> 04:43.320
Which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator.

04:43.320 --> 04:45.320
But see, this is what cancel culture does.

04:45.320 --> 04:48.320
It takes one story and transforms it

04:48.320 --> 04:51.320
into a significantly different story.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.320
You know, the headline I would write

04:53.320 --> 04:55.320
about the James and Tati story might read

04:55.320 --> 04:58.320
Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles

04:58.320 --> 05:00.320
of trying to trick straight men

05:00.320 --> 05:02.320
into thinking they're gay.

05:02.320 --> 05:04.320
But cancel culture transforms that story

05:04.320 --> 05:06.320
into the headline,

05:06.320 --> 05:09.320
James Charles is a sexual predator.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.320
Interesting.

05:11.320 --> 05:13.320
Now, I want to make it clear that my intention here

05:13.320 --> 05:15.320
is really not to defend James Charles.

05:15.320 --> 05:17.320
I'm not a James Charles stan.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.320
I'm a biological female in my 30s.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.320
Close to death, I know.

05:21.320 --> 05:23.320
Please leave a comment before I die.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.320
That said, I do think the statement

05:26.320 --> 05:28.320
James Charles is a sexual predator

05:28.320 --> 05:30.320
is a stretch, to say the least.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.320
At least, based on the information I have

05:32.320 --> 05:34.320
in December 2019.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.320
So let's analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.320
Cancel culture trope one.

05:38.320 --> 05:40.320
And you should be writing this down, class,

05:40.320 --> 05:42.320
because this will be on the test.

05:42.320 --> 05:44.320
Cancel culture trope one.

05:44.320 --> 05:45.320
Presumption of guilt.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.320
There's a traditional understanding of justice

05:48.320 --> 05:49.320
according to which,

05:49.320 --> 05:51.320
before you condemn or punish a person,

05:51.320 --> 05:53.320
you hear the accuser's side of the story

05:53.320 --> 05:56.320
and the accused's side of the story.

05:56.320 --> 05:58.320
You allow both sides to present evidence

05:58.320 --> 06:00.320
and only after everyone involved

06:00.320 --> 06:02.320
has had a chance to make their case

06:02.320 --> 06:05.320
do you pass sentence and punish the convict.

06:05.320 --> 06:07.320
Aww. Punish me, King.

06:07.320 --> 06:09.320
Drinking this is punishment enough.

06:09.320 --> 06:11.320
Am I uncanceled yet, please?

06:11.320 --> 06:13.320
In the United States,

06:13.320 --> 06:15.320
we legally have the presumption of innocence.

06:15.320 --> 06:18.320
But canceling does not abide by the law.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.320
Canceling is a form of vigilante mob justice.

06:21.320 --> 06:24.320
And a lot of times, an accusation is proof enough.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.320
Now, that's basically the point

06:26.320 --> 06:28.320
of the progressive slogan,

06:28.320 --> 06:30.320
believe victims.

06:30.320 --> 06:33.320
It's a norm that was put into place in progressive spaces

06:33.320 --> 06:35.320
because out in the world at large,

06:35.320 --> 06:37.320
people generally don't believe victims.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.320
But I think it's pretty obvious

06:39.320 --> 06:40.320
how believe victims

06:40.320 --> 06:42.320
is a norm that's easy to abuse.

06:42.320 --> 06:45.320
Was Tati really James' victim?

06:45.320 --> 06:46.320
No.

06:46.320 --> 06:48.320
She's not some powerless woman

06:48.320 --> 06:50.320
abused by a prominent man in her industry.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.320
She's on top of the industry.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.320
And she wasn't victimized by James at all.

06:55.320 --> 06:57.320
I see this case more as she weaponized

06:57.320 --> 07:00.320
cancel culture against a business rival.

07:00.320 --> 07:02.320
Anyway, before James had even had a chance

07:02.320 --> 07:04.320
to respond to Tati's accusation,

07:04.320 --> 07:06.320
the story had already gone from

07:06.320 --> 07:08.320
Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles

07:08.320 --> 07:10.320
of trying to trick straight men

07:10.320 --> 07:13.320
to James Charles tried to trick straight men.

07:13.320 --> 07:16.320
And from there, it was generalized into

07:16.320 --> 07:18.320
James Charles is toxic and manipulative.

07:18.320 --> 07:21.320
Which brings us to cancel culture trope two,

07:21.320 --> 07:23.320
abstraction.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.320
Abstraction replaces the specific,

07:25.320 --> 07:27.320
concrete details of a claim

07:27.320 --> 07:29.320
with a more generic statement.

07:29.320 --> 07:31.320
In the transition from Tati Westbrook

07:31.320 --> 07:34.320
accused James Charles of trying to trick straight men

07:34.320 --> 07:37.320
to James Charles is toxic and manipulative,

07:37.320 --> 07:40.320
we've lost not only the sense of this behavior,

07:40.320 --> 07:42.320
being an unverified accusation,

07:42.320 --> 07:45.320
but we've also lost all the specific details.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.320
James Charles is toxic and manipulative

07:47.320 --> 07:49.320
is an incredibly vague statement.

07:49.320 --> 07:52.320
It may as well be James Charles is bad.

07:52.320 --> 07:54.320
But even without the presumption of guilt,

07:54.320 --> 07:57.320
if someone tells me James Charles is accused

07:57.320 --> 07:59.320
of toxic and manipulative behavior,

07:59.320 --> 08:02.320
I'm gonna think, oh, that sounds pretty bad.

08:02.320 --> 08:04.320
And I'm gonna start speculating about the specifics.

08:04.320 --> 08:06.320
And whatever my imagination comes up with

08:06.320 --> 08:08.320
is likely going to be worse

08:08.320 --> 08:09.320
than whatever he's actually accused of.

08:09.320 --> 08:13.320
Also, the specific accusation

08:13.320 --> 08:15.320
that he tried to trick straight men

08:15.320 --> 08:17.320
into thinking they're gay

08:17.320 --> 08:20.320
is self-evidently kind of questionable.

08:20.320 --> 08:22.320
How do you trick straight men into thinking they're gay?

08:22.320 --> 08:24.320
If you find out, let me know.

08:24.320 --> 08:27.320
It's bad. I'm bad. I'm super bad.

08:27.320 --> 08:29.320
This is not a problem that straight men

08:29.320 --> 08:31.320
usually seem to have.

08:31.320 --> 08:33.320
At the very least, it requires further explanation.

08:33.320 --> 08:35.320
It's the kind of story that sounds like

08:35.320 --> 08:37.320
it has more than one side.

08:37.320 --> 08:39.320
I'm not gonna be gonna feel a little bit skeptical

08:39.320 --> 08:40.320
of the accusation.

08:40.320 --> 08:43.320
And I'm also gonna side-eye Tati Westbrook

08:43.320 --> 08:46.320
because this accusation is setting off

08:46.320 --> 08:48.320
my homophobia detection alarm.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.320
Leave the gays alone.

08:50.320 --> 08:52.320
But I'm not gonna have an opportunity

08:52.320 --> 08:54.320
to pick up on the potential homophobia

08:54.320 --> 08:56.320
and be skeptical of it

08:56.320 --> 08:58.320
if all I've heard about the situation

08:58.320 --> 09:00.320
is James Charles is toxic and manipulative.

09:00.320 --> 09:02.320
And I also wanna point out

09:02.320 --> 09:05.320
a linguistic shift that's happening here.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.320
When the claim was James Charles tried

09:07.320 --> 09:08.320
to trick straight men,

09:08.320 --> 09:11.320
the verbs in the sentence were try and trick.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.320
So what we're criticizing here is James' behavior.

09:14.320 --> 09:17.320
We're criticizing things he did, allegedly,

09:17.320 --> 09:19.320
trying to trick straight men.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.320
But once the claim morphs into James Charles

09:21.320 --> 09:23.320
is toxic and manipulative,

09:23.320 --> 09:26.320
the verb in the sentence is is, to be.

09:26.320 --> 09:29.320
So these adjectives are characteristics of James,

09:29.320 --> 09:31.320
and it's now not his actions we're criticizing

09:31.320 --> 09:34.320
but his personality, his toxicity,

09:34.320 --> 09:36.320
his manipulativeness.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.320
And this is what I'll call

09:37.320 --> 09:40.320
Cancel Culture Trope 3, essentialism.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.320
Essentialism is when we go

09:41.320 --> 09:43.320
from criticizing a person's actions

09:43.320 --> 09:46.320
to criticizing the person themselves.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
We're not just saying they did bad things,

09:48.320 --> 09:50.320
we're saying they're a bad person.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.320
And that's what takes us from

09:52.320 --> 09:54.320
James Charles tried to trick straight men

09:54.320 --> 09:58.320
to James Charles is a sexual predator.

09:58.320 --> 10:00.320
So here we're targeting James himself,

10:00.320 --> 10:02.320
not just his actions,

10:02.320 --> 10:04.320
but the type of person he is.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.320
A sexual predator.

10:06.320 --> 10:09.320
And we've also really escalated the accusation.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.320
Because I don't know about you guys,

10:11.320 --> 10:13.320
but when I hear the phrase sexual predator,

10:13.320 --> 10:15.320
the image that comes to mind is

10:15.320 --> 10:17.320
a rapist or a child molester,

10:17.320 --> 10:19.320
maybe an abusive boss?

10:19.320 --> 10:21.320
Not a teenage twink hung up

10:21.320 --> 10:23.320
on wanting to date straight guys.

10:23.320 --> 10:24.320
I mean, not that a person like that

10:24.320 --> 10:26.320
couldn't be a sexual predator,

10:26.320 --> 10:29.320
but I really don't think that he's a sexual predator

10:29.320 --> 10:32.320
is a fair summary of the accusation.

10:32.320 --> 10:34.320
So this seems to me like a pretty nasty

10:34.320 --> 10:36.320
and dishonest twisting of the story.

10:36.320 --> 10:38.320
And it happened instantaneously on Twitter.

10:38.320 --> 10:40.320
It totally dominated the conversation

10:40.320 --> 10:42.320
in a community of millions of people

10:42.320 --> 10:44.320
for weeks.

10:44.320 --> 10:45.320
In a few days,

10:45.320 --> 10:47.320
James had lost millions of subscribers,

10:47.320 --> 10:49.320
and who knows what effect it had on his personal life.

10:49.320 --> 10:51.320
Not that anyone seems to care.

10:51.320 --> 10:55.320
In fact, most people seemed to be enjoying his downfall.

10:55.320 --> 10:57.320
He was a teenage millionaire,

10:57.320 --> 10:59.320
a young, beautiful superstar.

10:59.320 --> 11:01.320
Easy to envy, easy to resent,

11:01.320 --> 11:04.320
hard to relate to, hard to sympathize with.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.320
What was the point of canceling James Charles?

11:06.320 --> 11:08.320
Did we want to teach him a lesson?

11:08.320 --> 11:10.320
Did we want him to learn from his mistakes

11:10.320 --> 11:12.320
and grow as a person?

11:12.320 --> 11:14.320
Imagine actually wanting someone to learn.

11:14.320 --> 11:16.320
Imagine actually caring.

11:16.320 --> 11:19.320
My hunch is that the average YouTube viewer

11:19.320 --> 11:21.320
was not sincerely outraged and hurt

11:21.320 --> 11:23.320
by their sincere belief that James Charles

11:23.320 --> 11:25.320
was a sexual predator.

11:25.320 --> 11:28.320
In other words, this was not a case of triggered SJWs.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.320
This was a controversy manufactured from the top

11:31.320 --> 11:34.320
by a handful of seemingly vindictive and envious people.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.320
I honestly think that most of the

11:36.320 --> 11:38.320
James Charles is a sexual predator crowd

11:38.320 --> 11:41.320
just wanted to bring him down a peg.

11:41.320 --> 11:42.320
Cancel culture trope four.

11:42.320 --> 11:45.320
Pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.320
If you look at the world we live in,

11:47.320 --> 11:50.320
would you say that people are usually motivated

11:50.320 --> 11:53.320
by a sense of moral integrity and intellectual rigor?

11:53.320 --> 11:55.320
No, maybe not.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.320
Let's be real, America.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.320
We are a bunch of morally impotent meatbags

12:00.320 --> 12:03.320
constantly shitting ourselves out of fear and lust.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.320
For Tati, calling out James, this was really,

12:07.320 --> 12:10.320
it was about the hair vitamins, right?

12:10.320 --> 12:13.320
I think sis was super salty that this millionaire kid

12:13.320 --> 12:15.320
who she had supported and helped

12:15.320 --> 12:18.320
had betrayed her by endorsing a rival brand.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.320
And accusing him of trying to trick straight men

12:21.320 --> 12:23.320
was just a twist of the knife.

12:23.320 --> 12:25.320
But moralism or intellectualism

12:25.320 --> 12:28.320
provide a phony pretext for the call out.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.320
You can pretend you just want an apology.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.320
You can pretend you're just a concerned citizen

12:33.320 --> 12:35.320
who wants the person to improve.

12:35.320 --> 12:37.320
You can pretend you're simply offering up criticism

12:37.320 --> 12:39.320
when what you're really doing

12:39.320 --> 12:41.320
is attacking a person's career and reputation

12:41.320 --> 12:43.320
out of spite, envy, revenge.

12:43.320 --> 12:45.320
I mean, it could be any motivation.

12:45.320 --> 12:47.320
Twitter viewed James as an overprivileged,

12:47.320 --> 12:49.320
spoiled little brat

12:49.320 --> 12:53.320
and it was fun to wipe the smile off his smug face

12:53.320 --> 12:55.320
at least for a few weeks.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.320
It's schadenfreude, right?

12:56.320 --> 12:58.320
This kind of petty sadism.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.320
Maybe not the internet's proudest moment,

13:00.320 --> 13:02.320
but not the most shameful either.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.320
And it's not to say that everyone cancelling James Charles

13:04.320 --> 13:05.320
was insincere.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.320
But there's a world of difference

13:07.320 --> 13:09.320
between Cancel R. Kelly

13:09.320 --> 13:11.320
and Cancel James Charles.

13:11.320 --> 13:13.320
And I'm interested to know

13:13.320 --> 13:16.320
how these two things came to look the same.

13:16.320 --> 13:17.320
When James was being cancelled,

13:17.320 --> 13:19.320
I remember being kind of transfixed

13:19.320 --> 13:21.320
by the sight of his life and career

13:21.320 --> 13:23.320
falling from the sky,

13:23.320 --> 13:26.320
full tailspin, black smoke spewing out.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.320
And a lot of my YouTube friends were like,

13:28.320 --> 13:30.320
lol, did you see James Charles is cancelled?

13:30.320 --> 13:31.320
lolololololol.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.320
But I looked up at James and I said,

13:33.320 --> 13:37.320
oh god, that's gonna be me someday.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.320
Stay strong, sister.

13:39.320 --> 13:41.320
Don't let the bastards get you down.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.320
Let's switch over to White Claw.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.320
These are cute, these are fun.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.320
A little more of a feminine moment for me.

13:49.320 --> 13:52.320
They didn't even have these last time I was an alcoholic.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.320
I'm not even wearing makeup.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.320
I don't need makeup to serve a full biological fantasy.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.320
Keep drinking, people.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.320
We're gonna make it through this together.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.320
So I was doing a little Twitter archaeology

14:04.320 --> 14:07.320
when I was looking into the James Charles cancelling,

14:07.320 --> 14:09.320
and I found a bunch of tweets

14:09.320 --> 14:12.320
referencing earlier James Charles scandals.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.320
Y'all forgiving James Charles?

14:13.320 --> 14:15.320
He's still a transphobe.

14:15.320 --> 14:18.320
Y'all are acting like just because James Charles has receipts,

14:18.320 --> 14:20.320
he's no longer a racist transphobe.

14:20.320 --> 14:24.320
Like, James Charles is racist, ableist, transphobic,

14:24.320 --> 14:26.320
and a sexual predator.

14:26.320 --> 14:27.320
A white woman.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.320
Y'all are being too harsh on him and he's uncancelled.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.320
So according to Twitter,

14:31.320 --> 14:34.320
James Charles is not only a sexual predator,

14:34.320 --> 14:38.320
he's also a racist and a transphobe.

14:38.320 --> 14:39.320
That sounds pretty serious.

14:39.320 --> 14:41.320
Let's investigate.

14:41.320 --> 14:43.320
We'll start with the transphobia allocation.

14:43.320 --> 14:45.320
Cockerels of the jury.

14:45.320 --> 14:46.320
Exhibit A.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.320
So you're not even full gay.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.320
I mean, no, there have been girls in the past that I've, like,

14:49.320 --> 14:50.320
thought were really, really beautiful.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.320
There's also been, like, trans guys in the past, too,

14:52.320 --> 14:55.320
that I was, like, really, really into for a moment in time.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.320
And I oop.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.320
As they say on Twitter,

14:57.320 --> 14:58.320
yikes.

14:58.320 --> 14:59.320
This ain't it, chief.

14:59.320 --> 15:02.320
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.320
Maybe don't be transphobic.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.320
Disappointing.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.320
So James did, uh, fuck up here.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.320
The problem is he's suggesting that being attracted to trans men

15:12.320 --> 15:14.320
makes him less gay,

15:14.320 --> 15:17.320
which implies that trans men aren't really men,

15:17.320 --> 15:20.320
which is at odds with the way trans men understand themselves.

15:20.320 --> 15:22.320
So this does deserve criticism.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.320
No doubt, no doubt.

15:23.320 --> 15:26.320
However, what I see when I look at this clip of James

15:26.320 --> 15:27.320
is not

15:27.320 --> 15:30.320
a dyed-in-the-wool transphobic bigot.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.320
I see a very young person

15:32.320 --> 15:36.320
who's still working on understanding his own sexuality

15:36.320 --> 15:38.320
and is trying to figure out

15:38.320 --> 15:41.320
where his attraction to trans men fits into that.

15:41.320 --> 15:45.320
And it seems to me that the proportionate response to that situation

15:45.320 --> 15:48.320
is for someone to take James aside

15:48.320 --> 15:49.320
and explain to him,

15:49.320 --> 15:53.320
look, here's why what you said is hurtful to trans men,

15:53.320 --> 15:56.320
and here are some tips on how to avoid saying that kind of thing in the future.

15:56.320 --> 16:01.320
You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred.

16:01.320 --> 16:05.320
Not understanding someone is not the same as wanting them dead.

16:05.320 --> 16:07.320
Of course, there are committed bigots

16:07.320 --> 16:09.320
who it's just a waste of time to engage with.

16:09.320 --> 16:12.320
But sometimes just talking to someone

16:12.320 --> 16:15.320
with a little patience and understanding is all it takes.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.320
But that's not what cancel culture does.

16:17.320 --> 16:21.320
Oh no, we have to immediately escalate every situation

16:21.320 --> 16:24.320
to the highest possible level of conflict.

16:24.320 --> 16:25.320
So by abstraction,

16:25.320 --> 16:28.320
we get James Charles made transphobic comments.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.320
And by essentialism, we get

16:30.320 --> 16:33.320
James Charles is a transphobe.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.320
We don't give him a chance to reflect.

16:35.320 --> 16:37.320
We don't give him an opportunity to learn.

16:37.320 --> 16:41.320
We go straight to branding him a bigot.

16:41.320 --> 16:43.320
Nonetheless, that same week,

16:43.320 --> 16:46.320
James posted an apology to his Insta story saying,

16:46.320 --> 16:48.320
Regardless of whatever my intentions were,

16:48.320 --> 16:50.320
that came across as me saying

16:50.320 --> 16:53.320
I'm not fully gay because I have been with a trans man

16:53.320 --> 16:54.320
and that is absolutely,

16:54.320 --> 16:56.320
first of all, not true.

16:56.320 --> 16:58.320
Like that doesn't make me not fully gay.

16:58.320 --> 17:00.320
But that stereotype and implication

17:00.320 --> 17:02.320
is really, really dangerous.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.320
And I'm very, very sorry.

17:04.320 --> 17:06.320
If you are a trans man, you are a man.

17:06.320 --> 17:08.320
If you're a trans girl, you are a woman.

17:08.320 --> 17:10.320
You are valid in your identity.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.320
Could you ask for a better apology?

17:12.320 --> 17:15.320
Like he not only apologizes for what he said,

17:15.320 --> 17:17.320
but he also demonstrates a clear understanding

17:17.320 --> 17:19.320
of why it was wrong.

17:19.320 --> 17:23.320
So does that mean people stopped calling him a transphobe?

17:23.320 --> 17:25.320
Of course not.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.320
Cancel culture trope five, no forgiveness.

17:28.320 --> 17:32.320
Cancelers will often dismiss an apology as insincere,

17:32.320 --> 17:34.320
no matter how convincingly written or delivered.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.320
And of course, an insincere apology is further proof

17:38.320 --> 17:41.320
of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.

17:41.320 --> 17:43.320
Now, sometimes a good apology

17:43.320 --> 17:45.320
will calm things down for a while.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.320
But the next time there's a scandal,

17:47.320 --> 17:50.320
the original accusation will be raised again,

17:50.320 --> 17:52.320
as if you never apologized.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.320
That's what happened to James during the Tati scandal,

17:54.320 --> 17:59.320
when Twitter decided he was a transphobic sexual predator.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.320
And that's to say nothing of this racism

18:01.320 --> 18:03.320
I've been hearing about.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.320
Here's the receipts.

18:04.320 --> 18:05.320
Exhibit B.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.320
In February 2017,

18:07.320 --> 18:09.320
when James was much less famous than he is now,

18:09.320 --> 18:10.320
he tweeted,

18:10.320 --> 18:12.320
I can't believe we're going to Africa today.

18:12.320 --> 18:14.320
OMG, what if we get Ebola?

18:14.320 --> 18:15.320
James, we're fine.

18:15.320 --> 18:17.320
We could have gotten it at Chipotle last year.

18:17.320 --> 18:21.320
Okay, well, that's a little insensitive, maybe.

18:21.320 --> 18:24.320
It's not really something an influencer should tweet.

18:24.320 --> 18:28.320
And fear of disease associated with Africa.

18:28.320 --> 18:32.320
I mean, I can see how it's in the same vague conceptual area

18:32.320 --> 18:34.320
as certain racist tropes.

18:34.320 --> 18:37.320
But clearly, this was intended as a joke

18:37.320 --> 18:40.320
about his friend mistaking Ebola for E. coli, right?

18:40.320 --> 18:43.320
And anyway, he did apologize, saying,

18:43.320 --> 18:45.320
As a white cis male,

18:45.320 --> 18:46.320
I recognize my privilege

18:46.320 --> 18:49.320
and would never want to take that for granted.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.320
But I fucked up.

18:50.320 --> 18:52.320
I feel awful for posting what I said.

18:52.320 --> 18:55.320
I understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.320
And James hasn't made a habit of making jokes like that ever since.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.320
So...

18:59.320 --> 19:02.320
Is this one tweet from two years ago

19:02.320 --> 19:03.320
that he apologized for

19:03.320 --> 19:05.320
on its own enough evidence

19:05.320 --> 19:07.320
for us to justify labeling him

19:07.320 --> 19:09.320
a racist?

19:09.320 --> 19:12.320
Well, according to cancel culture, absolutely.

19:12.320 --> 19:14.320
Abstraction takes us from

19:14.320 --> 19:16.320
Two years ago, James Charles made a joke

19:16.320 --> 19:19.320
that referenced his fear of getting Ebola in Africa

19:19.320 --> 19:22.320
to James Charles made a racist joke.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.320
And then essentialism takes us to

19:24.320 --> 19:27.320
James Charles is a racist.

19:34.320 --> 19:36.320
Look, I want to pause to say

19:36.320 --> 19:39.320
I really do believe in social justice.

19:39.320 --> 19:43.320
At least, as much as trash like me believes in anything.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.320
And believe me, I am well aware

19:45.320 --> 19:48.320
that jokes, irony, and even complaints about cancel culture

19:48.320 --> 19:53.320
are often used by bigots to cloak their real agenda.

19:53.320 --> 19:56.320
The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video

19:56.320 --> 19:59.320
about how far-right racists use jokes and memes

19:59.320 --> 20:01.320
and mockery of SJWs

20:01.320 --> 20:04.320
as a way to camouflage their hateful beliefs

20:04.320 --> 20:07.320
and make them more palatable to a wider audience.

20:07.320 --> 20:10.320
So I'm coming at this from a place of genuine concern

20:10.320 --> 20:13.320
for anti-racism and anti-transphobia

20:13.320 --> 20:15.320
as well as an awareness of the fact

20:15.320 --> 20:17.320
that cancel culture is often just

20:17.320 --> 20:20.320
a conservative red herring used to shut down

20:20.320 --> 20:23.320
any and all complaints about racism or transphobia.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.320
But I've also become very disillusioned

20:27.320 --> 20:29.320
with the way these accusations are thrown around

20:29.320 --> 20:32.320
so frivolously on social media.

20:32.320 --> 20:35.320
By the way, they're used to escalate conflict

20:35.320 --> 20:37.320
instead of promote understanding.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.320
And by the way, they're sometimes weaponized

20:40.320 --> 20:43.320
to destroy people who have made mistakes

20:43.320 --> 20:46.320
but who really don't deserve to be destroyed.

20:46.320 --> 20:48.320
Now maybe you're thinking,

20:48.320 --> 20:50.320
destroyed? What do you mean destroyed?

20:50.320 --> 20:52.320
James is a 20-year-old millionaire

20:52.320 --> 20:54.320
on his way to owning his own makeup empire.

20:54.320 --> 20:57.320
And you are completely correct.

20:57.320 --> 21:00.320
If you're James Charles, if you're a superstar,

21:00.320 --> 21:03.320
then being canceled most likely does not destroy you.

21:03.320 --> 21:07.320
The cancelers blend in to the general backdrop of haters

21:07.320 --> 21:10.320
and they can set you back a few million subscribers

21:10.320 --> 21:12.320
and a lot of emotional turmoil,

21:12.320 --> 21:16.320
but in the long run, they can't really touch your success.

21:16.320 --> 21:17.320
But here's the thing.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.320
What if you're not James Charles?

21:19.320 --> 21:21.320
What if you're a small creator?

21:21.320 --> 21:24.320
What if you can't afford public relations help?

21:24.320 --> 21:26.320
What if you belong to a marginalized community

21:26.320 --> 21:28.320
and you rely on that community for support?

21:28.320 --> 21:32.320
Well, in that case, it's a whole different story.

21:34.320 --> 21:37.320
Let's Irish up this coffee.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.320
Shaken, not stirred.

21:43.320 --> 21:45.320
Spilled it over my pussy.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.320
Mmm, that's good.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.320
Booze and coffee is a good combination.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.320
I'm feeling amped right now.

21:52.320 --> 21:53.320
I'm feeling hype.

21:53.320 --> 21:55.320
So this is the part in the video where I should admit

21:55.320 --> 21:57.320
that I'm not just a casual observer here.

21:57.320 --> 21:59.320
At the time I'm making this video,

21:59.320 --> 22:00.320
sweaty,

22:00.320 --> 22:01.320
I'm super canceled.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.320
You know, I try to make videos that are both informative and entertaining.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.320
So in this video, the information is

22:06.320 --> 22:08.320
you get to learn about cancel culture

22:08.320 --> 22:10.320
and the entertainment is

22:10.320 --> 22:12.320
you get to watch a worm try to wriggle off a hook.

22:12.320 --> 22:13.320
Let's get started.

22:13.320 --> 22:15.320
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

22:15.320 --> 22:16.320
Hey, how are you?

22:16.320 --> 22:18.320
God, I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber

22:18.320 --> 22:20.320
who would resort to making videos about my own drama,

22:20.320 --> 22:23.320
but things have gotten to a point.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.320
I feel like I cannot continue this channel

22:25.320 --> 22:26.320
until I spill some tea.

22:26.320 --> 22:28.320
So let's get started.

22:28.320 --> 22:30.320
Okay, first, a little backstory, a little mise-en-scene.

22:30.320 --> 22:32.320
I've never talked about this on my channel before,

22:32.320 --> 22:35.320
so this is a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.

22:35.320 --> 22:37.320
But I am, in fact, a transgender woman,

22:37.320 --> 22:40.320
which may come as a big shock to many of you

22:40.320 --> 22:42.320
since I'm 100% real fesh.

22:42.320 --> 22:45.320
I get comments all the time from very solemn people like,

22:45.320 --> 22:49.320
guys, I'm pretty sure this is a dude.

22:49.320 --> 22:50.320
Great work, detective.

22:50.320 --> 22:51.320
You cracked the case.

22:51.320 --> 22:53.320
You're doing very good, sweetie.

22:53.320 --> 22:55.320
Very, very good.

22:55.320 --> 22:58.320
But yes, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transgenders,

22:58.320 --> 23:01.320
I am a prime target for cancellation,

23:01.320 --> 23:04.320
and I have been canceled many, many times.

23:04.320 --> 23:05.320
And we're gonna talk about some of the things

23:05.320 --> 23:06.320
I've been canceled for

23:06.320 --> 23:08.320
and some of the things I've been criticized for

23:08.320 --> 23:10.320
and the difference between criticism and canceling.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.320
Because yes, there is a difference.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.320
As we go along,

23:13.320 --> 23:15.320
I will admit where I have made mistakes

23:15.320 --> 23:16.320
because despite how I look,

23:16.320 --> 23:18.320
I am not a literal goddess,

23:18.320 --> 23:23.320
and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.320
However, where I believe that criticism of me

23:26.320 --> 23:28.320
is excessive or unwarranted,

23:28.320 --> 23:29.320
I will not apologize

23:29.320 --> 23:31.320
because here at ContraPoints Industries,

23:31.320 --> 23:33.320
we are not in the business of serving bullshit.

23:33.320 --> 23:37.320
So, the reason for my current cancellation is,

23:37.320 --> 23:40.320
in summary, that in my last video, Opulence,

23:40.320 --> 23:42.320
I cast transsexual violence

23:42.320 --> 23:44.320
on the beautiful porn star Buck Angel

23:44.320 --> 23:45.320
in the role of John Waters.

23:45.320 --> 23:47.320
And yes, it's a much better story

23:47.320 --> 23:48.320
than the hair vitamin debacle,

23:48.320 --> 23:49.320
so notify the drama channels,

23:49.320 --> 23:51.320
put in a good word for me,

23:51.320 --> 23:52.320
because, sweetie,

23:52.320 --> 23:53.320
I'm not here to make friends.

23:53.320 --> 23:54.320
I'm here to win.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.320
So basically, I'm canceled

23:55.320 --> 23:57.320
for collaborating with Buck Angel,

23:57.320 --> 23:58.320
and a lot of trans people think

23:58.320 --> 24:01.320
Buck Angel is a horrible person.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.320
And so my collaboration with Buck Angel

24:03.320 --> 24:05.320
is evidence that I, too,

24:05.320 --> 24:07.320
am a horrible person.

24:07.320 --> 24:09.320
Cancel culture trope six,

24:09.320 --> 24:11.320
the transitive property of cancellation.

24:11.320 --> 24:13.320
Cancellation is infectious.

24:13.320 --> 24:15.320
If you associate with a canceled person,

24:15.320 --> 24:17.320
the cancellation rubs off.

24:17.320 --> 24:18.320
It's like gonorrhea,

24:18.320 --> 24:21.320
except doxycycline won't save you this time, sweetie.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.320
Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all,

24:23.320 --> 24:26.320
on whether Buck Angel is, in fact,

24:26.320 --> 24:28.320
a horrible person.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.320
So who is Buck Angel?

24:29.320 --> 24:33.320
Well, he's a trans man of my parents' generation.

24:33.320 --> 24:34.320
He grew up in a world

24:34.320 --> 24:36.320
where there was not anything like the visibility

24:36.320 --> 24:38.320
and access to information about transition we have today,

24:38.320 --> 24:40.320
and where there was a strict medical gatekeeping system

24:40.320 --> 24:43.320
in place for people who wanted to transition.

24:43.320 --> 24:45.320
In fact, Buck was the first female-to-male patient

24:45.320 --> 24:47.320
his doctor had ever treated.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.320
In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer,

24:50.320 --> 24:52.320
his gimmick at the time being the man with the pussy.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.320
But he also became an activist.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.320
He wanted to create more positive trans representation

24:56.320 --> 24:57.320
within the porn world.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.320
And from there, he became a more general educator

24:59.320 --> 25:01.320
and advocate for trans people.

25:01.320 --> 25:03.320
I first heard about him in the early 2010s

25:03.320 --> 25:05.320
when I was doing some Googling

25:05.320 --> 25:08.320
about some little gender issues I was having myself,

25:08.320 --> 25:10.320
although I ended up deciding to remain a female.

25:10.320 --> 25:12.320
And Buck was one of the first female-to-male people

25:12.320 --> 25:13.320
I'd ever heard about.

25:13.320 --> 25:14.320
And he made an impact on me,

25:14.320 --> 25:16.320
in part because you take one look at him and you think,

25:16.320 --> 25:17.320
honey, that's a man.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.320
But he was born a woman.

25:20.320 --> 25:21.320
You can do that.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.320
So it's not that he inspired me to transition or anything,

25:24.320 --> 25:26.320
it's just, it was one of many moments

25:26.320 --> 25:27.320
along my whole entire gender journey.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.320
So I had positive feelings about Tran-pa,

25:29.320 --> 25:31.320
that's what he calls himself,

25:31.320 --> 25:32.320
from back then.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.320
And then a few months ago,

25:33.320 --> 25:36.320
when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised

25:36.320 --> 25:38.320
over another time I was being canceled by trans Twitter,

25:38.320 --> 25:39.320
we'll get to that one later,

25:39.320 --> 25:42.320
I saw this post from Buck on Instagram.

26:09.320 --> 26:11.320
And those were exactly the words I needed to hear

26:11.320 --> 26:12.320
at that moment.

26:12.320 --> 26:15.320
So I commented a heart and then Buck DMed me

26:15.320 --> 26:16.320
and he said, I love you.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.320
And I was like,

26:17.320 --> 26:18.320
senpai noticed me.

26:18.320 --> 26:20.320
And so I said, I love you back.

26:20.320 --> 26:22.320
Then when I was working on Opulence,

26:22.320 --> 26:25.320
I needed a voice actor to do a line from John Waters' book.

26:25.320 --> 26:28.320
And it was my co-director Theron who suggested,

26:28.320 --> 26:30.320
don't you think Buck Angel sounds kind of like John Waters?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.320
And I said, well, he just messaged me on Insta,

26:32.320 --> 26:33.320
let's see if he wants to do it.

26:33.320 --> 26:36.320
And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel

26:36.320 --> 26:38.320
as John Waters in the video credits,

26:38.320 --> 26:41.320
like a trans icon playing a gay icon.

26:41.320 --> 26:45.320
In my head it was just so, well, iconic.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.320
So I got in touch with Buck about the line

26:46.320 --> 26:48.320
and he was like, yeah, I'd love to do it.

26:48.320 --> 26:49.320
So here it is,

26:49.320 --> 26:52.320
the 10 second voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.320
One must remember,

26:54.320 --> 26:58.320
there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.

26:58.320 --> 27:00.320
To understand bad taste,

27:00.320 --> 27:02.320
one must have very good taste.

27:02.320 --> 27:04.320
That's it children.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.320
That's why mommy's canceled.

27:06.320 --> 27:07.320
Now I was aware at the time

27:07.320 --> 27:08.320
that trans Twitter hate

27:08.320 --> 27:09.320
and hated Buck Angel,

27:09.320 --> 27:10.320
but my thinking was,

27:10.320 --> 27:13.320
well, trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity

27:13.320 --> 27:15.320
and they certainly hate me.

27:15.320 --> 27:17.320
So I wasn't going to let that stop me.

27:17.320 --> 27:18.320
Little did I know,

27:18.320 --> 27:20.320
quite how vicious things were about to get.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.320
Now, so far I've been telling this story

27:22.320 --> 27:23.320
from my point of view,

27:23.320 --> 27:26.320
but I do want to give a fair and balanced account.

27:26.320 --> 27:28.320
So I want to pause and contextualize

27:28.320 --> 27:31.320
why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much,

27:31.320 --> 27:34.320
they're willing to cancel anyone who even associates with him.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
Basically it all goes back to this old debate

27:36.320 --> 27:37.320
in the trans community known today

27:37.320 --> 27:41.320
and Tumblr lingo as true scum versus trans trenders.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.320
So true scum are trans people

27:43.320 --> 27:45.320
who distinguish between true trans people

27:45.320 --> 27:46.320
and fake trans people,

27:46.320 --> 27:48.320
who they call trenders or too-cutes.

27:48.320 --> 27:51.320
Usually true scum think that what it is to be trans

27:51.320 --> 27:53.320
is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria,

27:53.320 --> 27:56.320
to pursue a medical transition involving hormones and surgery,

27:56.320 --> 28:00.320
and to socially re-assimilate into your target binary gender,

28:00.320 --> 28:01.320
so male or female.

28:01.320 --> 28:02.320
Anyone who's not that,

28:02.320 --> 28:03.320
according to true scum,

28:03.320 --> 28:05.320
must either be a confused teenager,

28:05.320 --> 28:06.320
someone just trying to get attention,

28:06.320 --> 28:10.320
someone mistaking their trauma or their fetish for being trans,

28:10.320 --> 28:12.320
in a word, a trender.

28:12.320 --> 28:14.320
So that's a vige of transness

28:14.320 --> 28:16.320
that usually excludes non-binary people

28:16.320 --> 28:18.320
as well as people who don't want to medically transition

28:18.320 --> 28:19.320
for whatever reason,

28:19.320 --> 28:22.320
and for that reason this view is sometimes also called

28:22.320 --> 28:23.320
transmedicalism.

28:23.320 --> 28:26.320
True scum obviously being the derogatory term for these people.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.320
So true scum are very hated by a lot of trans people

28:29.320 --> 28:32.320
because their viewpoint is that not all trans identities are valid,

28:32.320 --> 28:35.320
and Buck Angel is widely perceived to be true scum.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.320
So the next question to ask is,

28:37.320 --> 28:38.320
is this true?

28:38.320 --> 28:41.320
Is Buck Angel in fact true scum?

28:41.320 --> 28:44.320
Now my honest answer to that question is,

28:44.320 --> 28:45.320
I don't know.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.320
He's certainly said some things that sound like things true scum say,

28:48.320 --> 28:49.320
I'll give you that.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.320
A point he likes to make a lot is that he's transsexual,

28:51.320 --> 28:53.320
not transgender.

28:53.320 --> 28:56.320
And the difference between those terms is sometimes defined as

28:56.320 --> 28:59.320
transsexual implies that you want to pursue medical transition,

28:59.320 --> 29:01.320
so hormones and surgery,

29:01.320 --> 29:03.320
and transgender doesn't imply that.

29:03.320 --> 29:04.320
And people associate this,

29:04.320 --> 29:07.320
I'm transsexual not transgender thing with true scum

29:07.320 --> 29:10.320
because true scum often call themselves transsexuals

29:10.320 --> 29:13.320
and say that anyone who isn't a transsexual isn't really trans.

29:13.320 --> 29:17.320
And often those people will be very mean to people they call trenders,

29:17.320 --> 29:20.320
especially certain transmedicalist YouTubers like

29:20.320 --> 29:23.320
Vanessa LeBlanc and Too Cute Smasher 9000.

29:25.320 --> 29:27.320
Too Cute Smasher 9000.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.320
Roast me back Calvin, I dare you.

29:29.320 --> 29:36.320
But I think it's important to keep in mind that the term true scum

29:36.320 --> 29:39.320
is a product of the 2014 Tumblr wars,

29:39.320 --> 29:42.320
and trying to apply it to trans people of an older generation

29:42.320 --> 29:44.320
can sometimes be misleading.

29:44.320 --> 29:45.320
Like when Buck Angel transitioned,

29:45.320 --> 29:48.320
the word transsexual was just the word for his identity,

29:48.320 --> 29:50.320
and he still identifies that way.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.320
So when younger trans people tell him it's wrong to use the word transsexual,

29:53.320 --> 29:57.320
he feels like these ungrateful millennials are invalidating his identity.

29:57.320 --> 29:58.320
And I do understand where he's coming from,

29:58.320 --> 30:02.320
but I also understand why a lot of nonbinary people

30:02.320 --> 30:04.320
are skeptical about Buck.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.320
Like he says again and again,

30:05.320 --> 30:07.320
I'm transsexual, not transgender,

30:07.320 --> 30:09.320
like don't mix me up with those people.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.320
And that eagerness to separate himself from transgender people,

30:12.320 --> 30:14.320
it comes across as hostility.

30:14.320 --> 30:18.320
Like I don't think he's ever actually said that nonbinary people aren't valid,

30:18.320 --> 30:22.320
but I personally don't like that he seems like he wants to distance himself from them.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.320
And that's my disagreement with Buck.

30:24.320 --> 30:26.320
It's not that he invalidates nonbinary identities,

30:26.320 --> 30:28.320
because I don't really care.

30:28.320 --> 30:29.320
I don't really see him doing that.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.320
And if he was doing that,

30:30.320 --> 30:31.320
I would have seen it.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.320
Because for the last two months,

30:32.320 --> 30:36.320
a lot of people have been doing nothing but sending me problematic Buck Angel tweets.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.320
But as someone who cares a lot about nonbinary people,

30:38.320 --> 30:41.320
and who loves the nonbinary people in my life,

30:41.320 --> 30:44.320
it does upset me when he does this distancing thing.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.320
And I hope he listens to this criticism,

30:46.320 --> 30:49.320
because I think it would be cool if he got better about this.

30:49.320 --> 30:53.320
Of course, Buck is technically right that there are different kinds of trans people.

30:53.320 --> 30:56.320
And I agree it's important that we can make those distinctions

30:56.320 --> 30:58.320
and talk about the differences when they're relevant,

30:58.320 --> 31:00.320
but I also think that as a community,

31:00.320 --> 31:02.320
trans people benefit from unity,

31:02.320 --> 31:03.320
not division.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.320
Like if you have an employer who discriminates against trans people,

31:06.320 --> 31:08.320
they're not going to care if you're transsexual,

31:08.320 --> 31:09.320
transgender,

31:09.320 --> 31:10.320
nonbinary,

31:10.320 --> 31:11.320
or gender nonconforming.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.320
They're going to discriminate against you regardless.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.320
So we're all in this together.

31:15.320 --> 31:17.320
And there's a lot of disagreements among us,

31:17.320 --> 31:19.320
and we often don't get along so well.

31:19.320 --> 31:20.320
But politically,

31:20.320 --> 31:22.320
I think we should work together as much as possible

31:22.320 --> 31:24.320
instead of splitting into little factions,

31:24.320 --> 31:27.320
because we share most of the same interests.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.320
And I think the best way to do that

31:29.320 --> 31:31.320
is to build bridges instead of burning them.

31:31.320 --> 31:33.320
And that's why I'm willing to work with people like Buck Angel,

31:33.320 --> 31:35.320
who I have some disagreements with.

31:35.320 --> 31:37.320
It creates a connection, you know?

31:37.320 --> 31:40.320
And having that connection can lead to communication

31:40.320 --> 31:41.320
and build understanding.

31:41.320 --> 31:43.320
Also, I need all the connections I can get, Gorge.

31:43.320 --> 31:45.320
I am very lonely.

31:46.320 --> 31:47.320
It's not a joke.

31:47.320 --> 31:48.320
It's true.

31:48.320 --> 31:50.320
Now I get that some people have views that are so harmful

31:50.320 --> 31:53.320
that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous.

31:53.320 --> 31:54.320
But in any case,

31:54.320 --> 31:56.320
I didn't even give Buck a platform to share his opinions.

31:56.320 --> 32:00.320
I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator.

32:00.320 --> 32:01.320
A bunch of people on my subreddit were like,

32:01.320 --> 32:04.320
why couldn't she just get John Waters to do those lines?

32:04.320 --> 32:05.320
Well, first of all,

32:05.320 --> 32:06.320
I don't actually know John,

32:06.320 --> 32:08.320
but I just have a feeling he would write me off

32:08.320 --> 32:11.320
as some kind of millennial SJW.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.320
Like, why is Buck Angel canceled,

32:13.320 --> 32:14.320
but John Waters isn't?

32:14.320 --> 32:17.320
Well, because trans Twitter does not know who John Waters is.

32:17.320 --> 32:19.320
And let's try to keep it that way.

32:19.320 --> 32:21.320
I actually mentioned this to a friend of mine who knows John,

32:21.320 --> 32:23.320
and he told me that he and John

32:23.320 --> 32:25.320
have actually watched Buck Angel's porn together.

32:25.320 --> 32:28.320
So, plot twist.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.320
Okay, so trans Twitter won't forgive me

32:31.320 --> 32:33.320
unless I condemn Buck Angel as true scum

32:33.320 --> 32:35.320
and apologize for ever working with him.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.320
But I'm not going to do that,

32:37.320 --> 32:40.320
because I don't think it would be the right thing to do.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.320
And doing it just to get myself uncancelled

32:42.320 --> 32:43.320
would be cowardly.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.320
I'm happy to tell you I absolutely disagree

32:45.320 --> 32:47.320
with Buck's divisive rhetoric

32:47.320 --> 32:49.320
about transsexual versus transgender.

32:49.320 --> 32:51.320
I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender umbrella

32:51.320 --> 32:54.320
instead of trying to distance himself from the rest.

32:54.320 --> 32:56.320
And I'm happy to hear out the perspective of nonbinary people

32:56.320 --> 32:57.320
who don't trust him,

32:57.320 --> 32:59.320
because I totally get where they're coming from

32:59.320 --> 33:00.320
and I think that's valid.

33:00.320 --> 33:04.320
But I also respect the decades of good activism

33:04.320 --> 33:06.320
Buck Angel has done for trans people,

33:06.320 --> 33:08.320
and I am grateful to him for that.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.320
And in light of that,

33:09.320 --> 33:11.320
I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt

33:11.320 --> 33:12.320
about where his heart is,

33:12.320 --> 33:15.320
and express my criticism in a more measured way

33:15.320 --> 33:17.320
than just attacking who he is as a person.

33:17.320 --> 33:21.320
But Twitter needs to establish that he's a horrible person,

33:21.320 --> 33:24.320
because this is the strategy they've chosen to use

33:24.320 --> 33:27.320
to establish that I am a horrible person.

33:27.320 --> 33:30.320
And if the true scum allegation isn't strong enough to prove it,

33:30.320 --> 33:32.320
oh they have other pieces of evidence to fall back on

33:32.320 --> 33:34.320
to hold up their conclusion.

33:34.320 --> 33:36.320
For example, here's a tweet claiming

33:36.320 --> 33:39.320
Natalie's trying so fucking hard

33:39.320 --> 33:41.320
to make it sound like the only thing Buck Angel ever did

33:41.320 --> 33:43.320
was write a few iffy tweets,

33:43.320 --> 33:46.320
and that's just so fucking far from the truth.

33:46.320 --> 33:49.320
Dude launched a targeted tabloid harassment campaign

33:49.320 --> 33:51.320
outing a trans woman against her will

33:51.320 --> 33:54.320
with the specific intent of causing her physical, emotional,

33:54.320 --> 33:55.320
and professional harm.

33:55.320 --> 33:56.320
The shorter way of saying that

33:56.320 --> 33:58.320
is that he wanted to make her suffer,

33:58.320 --> 34:00.320
and she very well could have been killed.

34:00.320 --> 34:01.320
Yikes.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.320
This ain't it, chief.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.320
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

34:06.320 --> 34:08.320
Maybe don't try to get trans women killed.

34:08.320 --> 34:09.320
Disappointing.

34:09.320 --> 34:10.320
It sounds pretty serious.

34:10.320 --> 34:12.320
Let's investigate.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.320
Here's what I've managed to piece together.

34:14.320 --> 34:15.320
Scene one.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.320
The year is 2003.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.320
Los Angeles,

34:17.320 --> 34:18.320
where the movie world,

34:18.320 --> 34:19.320
the porn world,

34:19.320 --> 34:20.320
and the BDSM scene come together

34:20.320 --> 34:22.320
in a tale of heartbreak,

34:22.320 --> 34:23.320
betrayal,

34:23.320 --> 34:24.320
and transsexualism.

34:24.320 --> 34:25.320
La La Land.

34:25.320 --> 34:26.320
Dramatis Personae.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.320
Buck Angel,

34:27.320 --> 34:29.320
transsexual porn star.

34:29.320 --> 34:30.320
Ilsa Strix,

34:30.320 --> 34:31.320
dominatrix,

34:31.320 --> 34:32.320
then wife of Buck Angel.

34:32.320 --> 34:33.320
Lana Wachowski,

34:33.320 --> 34:36.320
wildly successful director of The Matrix,

34:36.320 --> 34:38.320
at the time not yet out as a transgender woman.

34:38.320 --> 34:42.320
The synopsis is that Ilsa Strix and Buck Angel's marriage ended

34:42.320 --> 34:45.320
after Ilsa had an affair with Lana Wachowski,

34:45.320 --> 34:46.320
who was not yet out as trans.

34:46.320 --> 34:49.320
So Buck was understandably upset about the affair,

34:49.320 --> 34:51.320
and in what seems like a petty act of revenge,

34:51.320 --> 34:53.320
told a series of magazines

34:53.320 --> 34:55.320
that this celebrity director Wachowski

34:55.320 --> 34:58.320
was a cross-dresser who had stolen his wife,

34:58.320 --> 35:01.320
which I guess was the information he had at the time.

35:01.320 --> 35:05.320
So is that outing a trans woman against her will?

35:05.320 --> 35:07.320
Well in retrospect it seems like it,

35:07.320 --> 35:10.320
though that may not be what he thought he was doing at the time.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.320
But to really get to the bottom of this,

35:12.320 --> 35:13.320
we have to do some digging.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.320
We have to trawl through the dirty details

35:15.320 --> 35:17.320
of trans people's personal histories,

35:17.320 --> 35:20.320
which I've noticed is one of the internet's favorite activities.

35:20.320 --> 35:22.320
So I actually went on eBay

35:22.320 --> 35:26.320
and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991 January 2006,

35:26.320 --> 35:29.320
and I'm finally able to reveal

35:31.320 --> 35:33.320
that the seller cancelled the order.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.320
God damn it!

35:35.320 --> 35:38.320
But I was finally able to track down and translate

35:38.320 --> 35:40.320
a Spanish version of the Rolling Stone article

35:40.320 --> 35:41.320
from the Wayback Machine,

35:41.320 --> 35:45.320
and I'm finally able to expose the truth.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.320
Stop.

35:46.320 --> 35:48.320
Freeze exactly where you are.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.320
Take a look at yourself

35:49.320 --> 35:51.320
and what all of us have been doing

35:51.320 --> 35:52.320
for the last 30 seconds.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.320
Who does this behavior remind you of?

35:54.320 --> 35:56.320
If your answer is social justice advocates

35:56.320 --> 35:58.320
fighting for trans equality,

35:58.320 --> 36:00.320
you are incorrect.

36:00.320 --> 36:03.320
If your answer is creepy stalkers who hate trans people,

36:05.320 --> 36:07.320
I am very suspicious of anyone

36:07.320 --> 36:09.320
whose online behavior prompts me

36:09.320 --> 36:11.320
to dig through articles full of dead names

36:11.320 --> 36:13.320
and sordid scandals involving trans people

36:13.320 --> 36:15.320
from almost two decades ago.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.320
This is very similar to techniques

36:17.320 --> 36:20.320
used against trans people by internet fascists.

36:20.320 --> 36:22.320
So I'm pretty suspicious of anyone

36:22.320 --> 36:24.320
pushing this kind of investigation.

36:24.320 --> 36:25.320
How can you tell the difference

36:25.320 --> 36:27.320
between a trans anarcho-socialist

36:27.320 --> 36:28.320
with an anime avatar

36:28.320 --> 36:30.320
and a Nazi pretending to be

36:30.320 --> 36:32.320
a trans anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar?

36:32.320 --> 36:34.320
Well, you can't.

36:34.320 --> 36:37.320
Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous,

36:37.320 --> 36:39.320
whether it's on 4chan or Twitter.

36:39.320 --> 36:41.320
So unless Buck Angel, Ilsa Strix,

36:41.320 --> 36:43.320
or Lana Wachowski gets in touch with me

36:43.320 --> 36:46.320
and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason

36:46.320 --> 36:48.320
they want me to publicly dig up

36:48.320 --> 36:50.320
their 17-year-old divorce drama,

36:50.320 --> 36:53.320
this is none of my fucking business.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.320
And it's none of yours either,

36:55.320 --> 36:57.320
so shut up and go back to Kiwi Farms

36:57.320 --> 36:58.320
where you belong.

37:04.320 --> 37:06.320
Let's Irish up this tea.

37:10.320 --> 37:12.320
Doesn't work as well with tea.

37:12.320 --> 37:16.320
So, setting aside any tabloid drama

37:16.320 --> 37:19.320
that may have happened during the Bush administration,

37:20.320 --> 37:22.320
I'm saying this in the cuntiest way,

37:22.320 --> 37:24.320
and they deserve it.

37:24.320 --> 37:27.320
They fucking deserve the cuntiness.

37:27.320 --> 37:31.320
I'm spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bathroom.

37:31.320 --> 37:32.320
I'm a lady.

37:32.320 --> 37:33.320
She's a woman.

37:33.320 --> 37:35.320
The main argument against me

37:35.320 --> 37:37.320
usually references a collage

37:37.320 --> 37:39.320
of Buck Angel's problematic tweets.

37:39.320 --> 37:41.320
And this is supposed to be definitive evidence

37:41.320 --> 37:43.320
that he is a horrible person,

37:43.320 --> 37:44.320
and therefore,

37:44.320 --> 37:46.320
that I am a horrible person

37:46.320 --> 37:47.320
for collaborating with him.

37:47.320 --> 37:49.320
Well, here's the thing, though.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.320
A collage of problematic tweets

37:51.320 --> 37:53.320
does not define a person.

37:53.320 --> 37:56.320
And I'm very used to being defined that way myself,

37:56.320 --> 37:58.320
so I know how unfair it can be.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.320
Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel,

38:00.320 --> 38:02.320
a lot of people on Twitter

38:02.320 --> 38:04.320
were already calling me truscum.

38:04.320 --> 38:06.320
That's been going on a year and a half now.

38:06.320 --> 38:08.320
And anytime my name comes up on Twitter,

38:08.320 --> 38:09.320
a bunch of people respond saying

38:09.320 --> 38:10.320
Natalie is truscum,

38:10.320 --> 38:12.320
Natalie is a transmedicalist,

38:12.320 --> 38:13.320
Natalie hates nonbinary people,

38:13.320 --> 38:15.320
and you should really think

38:15.320 --> 38:16.320
what kind of message you're sending

38:16.320 --> 38:18.320
to your trans and nonbinary followers

38:18.320 --> 38:20.320
by platforming her.

38:20.320 --> 38:22.320
And if the person defends me

38:22.320 --> 38:23.320
or argues back in any way,

38:23.320 --> 38:24.320
they say,

38:24.320 --> 38:26.320
I can't believe you're ignoring

38:26.320 --> 38:28.320
the valid concerns of marginalized people.

38:28.320 --> 38:30.320
You know, they're weaponizing

38:30.320 --> 38:32.320
their marginalized status as trans people

38:32.320 --> 38:34.320
to isolate and attack

38:34.320 --> 38:36.320
another trans person.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.320
And sometimes this stuff gets to my head, too.

38:38.320 --> 38:39.320
I start asking myself,

38:39.320 --> 38:41.320
wait, am I a transmedicalist?

38:41.320 --> 38:43.320
Do I really believe all these awful things

38:43.320 --> 38:44.320
they say I believe?

38:44.320 --> 38:45.320
But the answer is,

38:45.320 --> 38:46.320
no.

38:46.320 --> 38:47.320
I just don't.

38:47.320 --> 38:49.320
These things they're saying about me

38:49.320 --> 38:51.320
are 100% not true.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.320
You know, believe marginalized people

38:53.320 --> 38:55.320
is a norm that is encouraged

38:55.320 --> 38:57.320
in leftist spaces for good reason,

38:57.320 --> 38:59.320
much like believe victims

38:59.320 --> 39:00.320
or believe women.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.320
And these norms were established

39:02.320 --> 39:04.320
to counterbalance the mainstream tendency,

39:04.320 --> 39:06.320
which is not to listen

39:06.320 --> 39:07.320
to marginalized people

39:07.320 --> 39:08.320
or to victims

39:08.320 --> 39:09.320
or to women.

39:09.320 --> 39:11.320
But any norm can be abused.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.320
And the blunt fact of the matter is,

39:13.320 --> 39:16.320
sometimes marginalized people are wrong.

39:16.320 --> 39:18.320
Sometimes people calling themselves victims

39:18.320 --> 39:21.320
are obscuring a more complicated situation.

39:21.320 --> 39:24.320
And it's even happened once or twice

39:24.320 --> 39:26.320
that a woman has lied.

39:26.320 --> 39:29.320
And the accusation that I'm truscum

39:29.320 --> 39:31.320
is simply false.

39:31.320 --> 39:33.320
I mean, first of all,

39:33.320 --> 39:35.320
I don't even think of my own transgenderism

39:35.320 --> 39:36.320
as a medical disorder,

39:36.320 --> 39:38.320
much less everyone else's.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.320
I have, of course, collaborated with Dr. Spiegel

39:40.320 --> 39:41.320
at all,

39:41.320 --> 39:43.320
but I will not have my artistry

39:43.320 --> 39:45.320
reduced to mere medicine.

39:45.320 --> 39:46.320
Second,

39:46.320 --> 39:49.320
this accusation that I hate non-binary people

39:49.320 --> 39:50.320
is just...

39:50.320 --> 39:51.320
no.

39:51.320 --> 39:52.320
Non.

39:52.320 --> 39:53.320
Eh...

39:54.320 --> 39:55.320
Non.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.320
My thinking about trans identity

39:56.320 --> 39:59.320
has always been informed by non-binary people.

39:59.320 --> 40:01.320
I used to identify as non-binary myself

40:01.320 --> 40:03.320
before I medically transitioned,

40:03.320 --> 40:04.320
and some of the closest people to me

40:04.320 --> 40:05.320
in my life today

40:05.320 --> 40:07.320
are non-binary trans people,

40:07.320 --> 40:11.320
some of whom are also transsexuals, incidentally.

40:11.320 --> 40:12.320
It's complicated.

40:12.320 --> 40:14.320
I've also made at least five videos on this channel

40:14.320 --> 40:17.320
arguing for the validity of non-binary gender identities

40:17.320 --> 40:19.320
going back more than three years.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.320
So that's five out of around 50 videos,

40:21.320 --> 40:24.320
or 10% of the content I've made on this channel,

40:24.320 --> 40:26.320
is about non-binary identity.

40:26.320 --> 40:27.320
A few months ago,

40:27.320 --> 40:30.320
I even made a 30-minute video called TransTrenders,

40:30.320 --> 40:32.320
which uses character dialogue to show

40:32.320 --> 40:34.320
what I think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism.

40:34.320 --> 40:36.320
But there's still hundreds of people on Twitter

40:36.320 --> 40:39.320
saying that I'm truscum who hates non-binary people.

40:39.320 --> 40:41.320
And their main piece of evidence for that

40:41.320 --> 40:44.320
is a collage of my problematic tweets.

40:44.320 --> 40:46.320
So let's take a look at that.

40:46.320 --> 40:47.320
Here's the three tweets

40:47.320 --> 40:49.320
that I usually see scrapbooked together

40:49.320 --> 40:52.320
as definitive proof that I hate non-binary people.

40:52.320 --> 40:53.320
This is the first one,

40:53.320 --> 40:54.320
from September 2018.

40:54.320 --> 40:56.320
Notice how it's taken out of context from the thread

40:56.320 --> 40:58.320
so you can't even see what I'm talking about.

40:58.320 --> 41:01.320
I'm sure this is not the experience of many NBs

41:01.320 --> 41:02.320
.

41:02.320 --> 41:04.320
I leave it to them to articulate

41:04.320 --> 41:07.320
what NB existence looks like in a binary world.

41:07.320 --> 41:09.320
I do not and I cannot speak for them.

41:09.320 --> 41:10.320
But surely N-

41:10.320 --> 41:13.320
God, I used to write like such a nerd.

41:13.320 --> 41:14.320
But surely N-

41:14.320 --> 41:16.320
The account that begins and ends

41:16.320 --> 41:19.320
with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

41:19.320 --> 41:20.320
is pretty weak.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.320
Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread

41:22.320 --> 41:24.320
that that tweet has been clipped out of,

41:24.320 --> 41:27.320
I was defending myself from accusations

41:27.320 --> 41:29.320
that my most recent video at the time,

41:29.320 --> 41:30.320
The Aesthetic,

41:30.320 --> 41:31.320
was anti-non-binary.

41:31.320 --> 41:32.320
In that video,

41:32.320 --> 41:34.320
there's a character named Justine

41:34.320 --> 41:37.320
who defends a version of the performativity theory of gender.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.320
And basically I made this video

41:39.320 --> 41:41.320
to express some angst I was feeling

41:41.320 --> 41:43.320
about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye.

41:43.320 --> 41:46.320
This was a very one-year-on-hormones moment for me,

41:46.320 --> 41:48.320
and I've already moved on in my thinking.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.320
At that time I was very, um,

41:50.320 --> 41:53.320
my behavior must be perfectly feminine at all times

41:53.320 --> 41:55.320
or else I'm not really a woman.

41:55.320 --> 41:58.320
My self-esteem is totally based on sleeping with heterosexual men

41:58.320 --> 41:59.320
who resemble my father.

42:01.320 --> 42:03.320
And anyone who knows anything about trans women knows

42:03.320 --> 42:06.320
that most of us go through a stage like this at some point.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.320
And some YouTubers never get out of it.

42:08.320 --> 42:11.320
But personally, I mean these days,

42:11.320 --> 42:12.320
it doesn't matter what I wear.

42:12.320 --> 42:16.320
It's when I dream they're Lily's dreams.

42:18.320 --> 42:19.320
Dragging the Danish girl.

42:19.320 --> 42:20.320
Well, fuck the Danish.

42:20.320 --> 42:22.320
I could never abide that sort of person.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.320
We all know what I'm talking about.

42:23.320 --> 42:25.320
You can tell the whiskey is getting to me

42:25.320 --> 42:28.320
because I'm being bigoted against the Danish.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.320
These things come out, you know.

42:30.320 --> 42:32.320
You get honest, you get real

42:32.320 --> 42:35.320
when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system.

42:35.320 --> 42:39.320
Did I just fucking put lipstick outside the fucking lip liner?

42:39.320 --> 42:40.320
This is all Lily's fault.

42:40.320 --> 42:41.320
Lily Alba.

42:41.320 --> 42:43.320
Fuck her dreams.

42:43.320 --> 42:45.320
The point is, when I was making the aesthetic,

42:45.320 --> 42:47.320
I wasn't even thinking about non-binary people.

42:47.320 --> 42:50.320
And people will say that the fact that not every video I make

42:50.320 --> 42:54.320
references non-binary people is itself NB-phobic.

42:54.320 --> 42:57.320
As I've said, about one in ten of my videos

42:57.320 --> 42:59.320
is about non-binary identity.

42:59.320 --> 43:01.320
But not all of them are.

43:01.320 --> 43:04.320
And I feel entitled to make some videos

43:04.320 --> 43:06.320
that are just about trans women.

43:06.320 --> 43:09.320
But still, some people on Twitter were saying

43:09.320 --> 43:12.320
that the character Justine is a transmedicalist.

43:12.320 --> 43:17.320
And because she maybe wins the fictional debate in the video,

43:17.320 --> 43:21.320
I, Natalie Nguyen, am therefore a transmedicalist.

43:21.320 --> 43:23.320
Here's the thing, though.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.320
The performativity theory of gender,

43:25.320 --> 43:27.320
the one that Justine defends in that video,

43:27.320 --> 43:31.320
is conceptually as far away from transmedicalism

43:31.320 --> 43:33.320
as it is possible to be.

43:33.320 --> 43:36.320
Transmedicalism says that trans identity is biological,

43:36.320 --> 43:38.320
it's neurological, it's hormonal,

43:38.320 --> 43:40.320
it's diagnosable and treatable.

43:40.320 --> 43:44.320
Whereas performativity says that gender is gesture,

43:44.320 --> 43:46.320
it's expression, it's performance,

43:46.320 --> 43:48.320
it's a social phenomenon.

43:48.320 --> 43:52.320
Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon.

43:52.320 --> 43:53.320
Phenomenon.

43:53.320 --> 43:56.320
Performativity makes no reference to gender dysphoria

43:56.320 --> 43:58.320
or to any kind of medical concept at all.

43:58.320 --> 44:02.320
So whereas transmedicalism is a kind of bioessentialism,

44:02.320 --> 44:05.320
performativity is a kind of social constructionism.

44:05.320 --> 44:08.320
So these are exact opposite theories of gender,

44:08.320 --> 44:10.320
are you following along, class?

44:10.320 --> 44:11.320
I'm not.

44:11.320 --> 44:14.320
I'm ready to drink Jameson tea until I die.

44:14.320 --> 44:16.320
But some trans people felt invalidated

44:16.320 --> 44:19.320
by things Justine says in that video.

44:19.320 --> 44:21.320
And transmedicalism is another thing

44:21.320 --> 44:23.320
that makes them feel invalidated.

44:23.320 --> 44:26.320
So they decided that Justine is a transmedicalist

44:26.320 --> 44:29.320
and therefore that I am a transmedicalist.

44:29.320 --> 44:32.320
And this is literally just bad media comprehension.

44:32.320 --> 44:36.320
Like it's a failure to plausibly interpret a video

44:36.320 --> 44:40.320
that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult.

44:40.320 --> 44:42.320
And so much of the negative response to that video

44:42.320 --> 44:43.320
is just pure emotion.

44:43.320 --> 44:44.320
I always hear,

44:44.320 --> 44:46.320
I don't care what you intended,

44:46.320 --> 44:48.320
trans people were hurt by that video.

44:48.320 --> 44:50.320
You hurt trans people.

44:50.320 --> 44:51.320
But here's the thing.

44:51.320 --> 44:54.320
Just because you were hurt by content I made

44:54.320 --> 44:56.320
doesn't mean that the content is bad

44:56.320 --> 44:58.320
or that I'm victimizing you in some way.

44:58.320 --> 44:59.320
I'll give you an example.

44:59.320 --> 45:01.320
I did a stream a couple years ago

45:01.320 --> 45:04.320
with a BDSM and kink activist.

45:04.320 --> 45:05.320
We were talking about various kinks

45:05.320 --> 45:07.320
and we got to DDLG,

45:07.320 --> 45:09.320
which is Daddy Dom Little Girl.

45:09.320 --> 45:14.320
Basically, when consenting adults roleplay age difference

45:14.320 --> 45:16.320
and the power dynamic that comes with that.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.320
And me and this kink activist

45:17.320 --> 45:20.320
were just casually discussing what DDLG is,

45:20.320 --> 45:21.320
what it isn't,

45:21.320 --> 45:23.320
when I noticed someone in the chat

45:23.320 --> 45:25.320
was starting to totally freak out.

45:25.320 --> 45:27.320
They were typing in all caps like,

45:27.320 --> 45:30.320
MY ABUSER USED DDLG TO JUSTIFY RAPING ME.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.320
WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING MY ABUSER?

45:32.320 --> 45:34.320
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D BETRAY ME LIKE THIS.

45:34.320 --> 45:35.320
PLEASE STOP TAKING MONEY

45:35.320 --> 45:36.320
FROM MY ABUSER'S SIDE.

45:36.320 --> 45:37.320
PLEASE STOP.

45:37.320 --> 45:38.320
I'M BEGGING YOU.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.320
This was actually really fucking upsetting to me

45:40.320 --> 45:43.320
because this person was clearly in a lot of pain.

45:43.320 --> 45:45.320
They were having a panic attack

45:45.320 --> 45:48.320
because they were having a trauma trigger reaction

45:48.320 --> 45:49.320
to this conversation.

45:49.320 --> 45:51.320
And I kept telling them to leave the stream

45:51.320 --> 45:53.320
and take care of themselves,

45:53.320 --> 45:54.320
but they wouldn't do it.

45:54.320 --> 45:56.320
So I had to block them

45:56.320 --> 45:57.320
and then later get in touch

45:57.320 --> 45:59.320
and make sure they were okay.

45:59.320 --> 46:02.320
Now, was their pain very real?

46:02.320 --> 46:03.320
Yes.

46:03.320 --> 46:04.320
Was it triggered

46:04.320 --> 46:06.320
by the content I was streaming?

46:06.320 --> 46:07.320
Yes.

46:07.320 --> 46:09.320
But does that mean I did anything wrong?

46:09.320 --> 46:10.320
No.

46:10.320 --> 46:12.320
Is it wrong to talk about kink

46:12.320 --> 46:13.320
in contexts where it's clear

46:13.320 --> 46:15.320
you're going to be talking about kink?

46:15.320 --> 46:16.320
No.

46:16.320 --> 46:19.320
But when you produce content online

46:19.320 --> 46:20.320
that's going to be viewed by thousands

46:20.320 --> 46:21.320
or millions of people,

46:21.320 --> 46:23.320
there's always some people out there

46:23.320 --> 46:25.320
who are going to be hurt by it.

46:25.320 --> 46:27.320
So if you want to argue that a tweet

46:27.320 --> 46:30.320
or a video I made is somehow immoral,

46:30.320 --> 46:32.320
I think you need more of an argument

46:32.320 --> 46:33.320
than just,

46:33.320 --> 46:34.320
people were hurt.

46:34.320 --> 46:36.320
Alright, back to the tweet.

46:36.320 --> 46:37.320
To this day,

46:37.320 --> 46:39.320
people quote tweet the sentence,

46:39.320 --> 46:41.320
but surely an account that begins and ends

46:41.320 --> 46:42.320
with I'm not a man

46:42.320 --> 46:43.320
because I don't identify as one

46:43.320 --> 46:44.320
is pretty weak.

46:44.320 --> 46:45.320
And they claim this is evidence

46:45.320 --> 46:46.320
that I'm true scum

46:46.320 --> 46:48.320
or that I think people have to prove

46:48.320 --> 46:49.320
their identities somehow,

46:49.320 --> 46:51.320
which is not at all

46:51.320 --> 46:53.320
what I was saying in that thread.

46:53.320 --> 46:54.320
What I was saying is

46:54.320 --> 46:57.320
if you're trying to persuade a skeptic

46:57.320 --> 46:59.320
that trans identity is valid,

46:59.320 --> 47:01.320
simply saying I'm not a man

47:01.320 --> 47:02.320
because I don't identify as one

47:02.320 --> 47:04.320
isn't a very good argument,

47:04.320 --> 47:05.320
which it isn't.

47:05.320 --> 47:07.320
I mean, no one has ever been persuaded by that

47:07.320 --> 47:08.320
so far as I'm aware.

47:08.320 --> 47:09.320
That said,

47:09.320 --> 47:11.320
I do now disagree with the mindset

47:11.320 --> 47:13.320
I had when I tweeted this.

47:13.320 --> 47:15.320
Back then, I still delusionally believed

47:15.320 --> 47:17.320
that it was possible to rationally explain

47:17.320 --> 47:19.320
why trans identity is valid,

47:19.320 --> 47:20.320
and I was simply looking for

47:20.320 --> 47:22.320
a more persuasive argument than,

47:22.320 --> 47:24.320
this is how I identify,

47:24.320 --> 47:25.320
you have to believe me,

47:25.320 --> 47:26.320
no further questions.

47:26.320 --> 47:28.320
But I no longer believe there can be

47:28.320 --> 47:31.320
any rational justification of gender identity,

47:31.320 --> 47:32.320
which is another reason

47:32.320 --> 47:33.320
I'm not a transmedicalist.

47:33.320 --> 47:36.320
Transmedicalism tries to be a rational theory

47:36.320 --> 47:38.320
about why trans identity is valid,

47:38.320 --> 47:40.320
and I don't think it succeeds as that.

47:40.320 --> 47:41.320
I don't think anything does.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.320
My current opinion about this is that

47:43.320 --> 47:46.320
I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

47:46.320 --> 47:48.320
is as good, or rather as bad,

47:48.320 --> 47:50.320
an argument as any.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.320
You know, some things in life just

47:52.320 --> 47:54.320
can't be rationally explained.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.320
Like love.

47:55.320 --> 47:57.320
Why do you love the person you love?

47:57.320 --> 47:59.320
Well, because you love them.

47:59.320 --> 48:00.320
You could write a poem about it,

48:00.320 --> 48:02.320
or some gay shit like that,

48:02.320 --> 48:04.320
but you can't give any actual arguments.

48:04.320 --> 48:06.320
And why am I a woman?

48:07.320 --> 48:08.320
Because I'm a woman.

48:08.320 --> 48:09.320
That's it.

48:09.320 --> 48:11.320
I mean, I can describe my experiences

48:11.320 --> 48:12.320
and my feelings to you

48:12.320 --> 48:14.320
to help you understand better,

48:14.320 --> 48:16.320
but I can't logically prove anything.

48:16.320 --> 48:18.320
And I'm super fucking sorry

48:18.320 --> 48:20.320
if you can't handle that mankind

48:20.320 --> 48:22.320
was set adrift in an absurd world.

48:22.320 --> 48:24.320
That must be super fucking hard for you.

48:24.320 --> 48:26.320
Tell me all about it.

48:26.320 --> 48:27.320
Next please.

48:27.320 --> 48:29.320
Okay, again we're mid-thread

48:29.320 --> 48:30.320
with missing context,

48:30.320 --> 48:31.320
but the tweet says,

48:31.320 --> 48:33.320
whereas I've met 20-year-olds

48:33.320 --> 48:35.320
in full-on boy mode who are like,

48:35.320 --> 48:36.320
hi, I'm a trans woman.

48:36.320 --> 48:37.320
She, her pronouns.

48:37.320 --> 48:40.320
So, I guess by including this tweet

48:40.320 --> 48:43.320
in the ContraPoints' problematic collage,

48:43.320 --> 48:46.320
people are implying that I don't think

48:46.320 --> 48:48.320
it's valid for someone who presents male

48:48.320 --> 48:49.320
to identify as a woman

48:49.320 --> 48:51.320
and request she, her pronouns.

48:51.320 --> 48:52.320
Well, that's not true.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.320
I was surprised when I first experienced this,

48:54.320 --> 48:56.320
but I think it's valid.

48:56.320 --> 48:57.320
Next.

48:57.320 --> 48:58.320
Okay, mid-thread, no context,

48:58.320 --> 49:00.320
once again.

49:00.320 --> 49:02.320
But now you go into these leftist Discord

49:02.320 --> 49:03.320
slash Facebook groups

49:03.320 --> 49:06.320
and like 20-30% identify as some flavor of trans.

49:06.320 --> 49:09.320
Most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals.

49:09.320 --> 49:11.320
That seems to be the future.

49:11.320 --> 49:12.320
Okay, well,

49:12.320 --> 49:14.320
it's true that many leftist Discord servers

49:14.320 --> 49:15.320
are like this.

49:15.320 --> 49:16.320
But reading this back,

49:16.320 --> 49:19.320
I don't like the way the phrase

49:19.320 --> 49:21.320
conventional binary transsexuals

49:21.320 --> 49:22.320
is hitting my ear.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.320
I can see how it could imply that

49:24.320 --> 49:27.320
non-binary identities are somehow newfangled,

49:27.320 --> 49:28.320
which isn't true.

49:28.320 --> 49:30.320
There's been non-binary people for longer

49:30.320 --> 49:32.320
than there's been medical transsexuals,

49:32.320 --> 49:33.320
in fact,

49:33.320 --> 49:35.320
so we'll call this a bad tweet.

49:35.320 --> 49:37.320
I apologize for tweeting it,

49:37.320 --> 49:39.320
and I apologize to any non-binary people

49:39.320 --> 49:41.320
who felt trivialized by it.

49:42.320 --> 49:44.320
Okay, this is the big one.

49:44.320 --> 49:45.320
This tweet got its own article

49:45.320 --> 49:47.320
in the fucking Guardian.

49:47.320 --> 49:48.320
You know, I really wish people

49:48.320 --> 49:49.320
would pay less attention to the tweets

49:49.320 --> 49:51.320
I spend 30 seconds writing

49:51.320 --> 49:53.320
and a little more attention to the videos

49:53.320 --> 49:54.320
that I spend, you know,

49:54.320 --> 49:56.320
hundreds of hours making.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.320
Anyway, let's look at the tweet.

49:58.320 --> 50:00.320
This is the most scrutinized paragraph

50:00.320 --> 50:01.320
I've ever written,

50:01.320 --> 50:03.320
and it's so mediocre.

50:03.320 --> 50:04.320
This has happened to me before

50:04.320 --> 50:06.320
in hyper-woke spaces.

50:06.320 --> 50:08.320
Like, it's me and a bunch of cis women,

50:08.320 --> 50:09.320
and we all have to go in a circle

50:09.320 --> 50:11.320
saying she, her, because I'm there.

50:11.320 --> 50:12.320
There's this paradox

50:12.320 --> 50:13.320
where I can go to a sports bar

50:13.320 --> 50:14.320
in North Carolina

50:14.320 --> 50:15.320
and be Miss Mamed all night,

50:15.320 --> 50:16.320
no question.

50:16.320 --> 50:19.320
But in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces,

50:19.320 --> 50:20.320
I have to explain my pronouns

50:20.320 --> 50:21.320
and watch woke people

50:21.320 --> 50:23.320
awkwardly correct themselves

50:23.320 --> 50:24.320
every time they say,

50:24.320 --> 50:25.320
you guys.

50:25.320 --> 50:26.320
I guess it's good for people

50:26.320 --> 50:27.320
who use they, them only

50:27.320 --> 50:29.320
and want only gender-neutral language,

50:29.320 --> 50:31.320
but it comes at the minor expense

50:31.320 --> 50:33.320
of semi-passable transes like me,

50:33.320 --> 50:36.320
and that's super fucking hard for us.

50:36.320 --> 50:38.320
So people interpreted this tweet

50:38.320 --> 50:40.320
as me being against the practice

50:40.320 --> 50:41.320
of sharing pronouns,

50:41.320 --> 50:44.320
which I'm literally just not.

50:44.320 --> 50:45.320
Like, I've actually been the person

50:45.320 --> 50:47.320
who initiates the pronoun circle

50:47.320 --> 50:48.320
many times.

50:48.320 --> 50:50.320
The backstory of this tweet

50:50.320 --> 50:51.320
is basically that

50:51.320 --> 50:53.320
I once got triggered

50:53.320 --> 50:54.320
in a situation

50:54.320 --> 50:56.320
where I was with a bunch of cis women

50:56.320 --> 50:57.320
and we all had to go around

50:57.320 --> 50:59.320
saying our pronouns,

50:59.320 --> 51:01.320
and like a typical triggered tranny,

51:01.320 --> 51:03.320
I tiptoed over to Twitter

51:03.320 --> 51:06.320
to tip-top type it out.

51:06.320 --> 51:07.320
But here's the thing,

51:07.320 --> 51:08.320
by the end of this thread,

51:08.320 --> 51:10.320
I had already talked myself away

51:10.320 --> 51:11.320
from the initial frustration

51:11.320 --> 51:12.320
I was expressing.

51:12.320 --> 51:14.320
If you know my videos and my voice,

51:14.320 --> 51:15.320
then you know me saying

51:15.320 --> 51:17.320
it comes at the minor expense

51:17.320 --> 51:20.320
of semi-passable transes

51:20.320 --> 51:23.320
and that's super fucking hard for us

51:23.320 --> 51:24.320
is sarcastic.

51:24.320 --> 51:26.320
It's a minor expense

51:26.320 --> 51:28.320
It's not actually very hard

51:28.320 --> 51:29.320
for us, Gorge.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.320
It's fine.

51:31.320 --> 51:32.320
But people on Twitter

51:32.320 --> 51:34.320
don't watch my videos

51:34.320 --> 51:36.320
and they don't get sarcasm.

51:36.320 --> 51:39.320
So people flipped out over this.

51:39.320 --> 51:41.320
I was getting dragged

51:41.320 --> 51:43.320
and I made the poor decision

51:43.320 --> 51:45.320
to try to solve the tweet problem

51:45.320 --> 51:46.320
with more tweeting,

51:46.320 --> 51:48.320
which 100% of the time

51:48.320 --> 51:50.320
is like trying to put out a fire

51:50.320 --> 51:52.320
with lighter fluid.

51:52.320 --> 51:54.320
So me and my dumb brain

51:54.320 --> 51:55.320
did another short thread

51:55.320 --> 51:57.320
trying to clarify what I was saying

51:57.320 --> 51:58.320
and defending my right

51:58.320 --> 52:00.320
to talk about my own experiences.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.320
That didn't make things any better.

52:02.320 --> 52:05.320
So in a state of anger and frustration,

52:05.320 --> 52:07.320
I tweeted out yet another thread.

52:07.320 --> 52:08.320
And this time I said

52:08.320 --> 52:10.320
some truly stupid things,

52:10.320 --> 52:12.320
including the now infamous line.

52:12.320 --> 52:14.320
I sometimes feel like the last

52:14.320 --> 52:17.320
of the old school transsexuals.

52:17.320 --> 52:19.320
I honestly don't know what the fuck

52:19.320 --> 52:21.320
I was even trying to say.

52:21.320 --> 52:23.320
I don't feel like the last

52:23.320 --> 52:24.320
of the old school transsexuals.

52:24.320 --> 52:26.320
I don't even know what that means.

52:26.320 --> 52:28.320
I guess I basically meant that

52:28.320 --> 52:32.320
offline, I don't have any radical aspirations.

52:32.320 --> 52:34.320
You know, I want to be inconspicuous.

52:34.320 --> 52:35.320
I want to blend in.

52:35.320 --> 52:37.320
And that's what I meant by old school.

52:37.320 --> 52:40.320
You know, I want people to assume my pronouns.

52:40.320 --> 52:41.320
You know, it's funny because

52:41.320 --> 52:43.320
it is very different from the way I am online

52:43.320 --> 52:46.320
where I'm totally shameless and open.

52:46.320 --> 52:47.320
I'm like,

52:47.320 --> 52:48.320
sexual confession, everybody.

52:48.320 --> 52:49.320
Sexual confession.

52:49.320 --> 52:52.320
I have abnormal urges.

52:52.320 --> 52:53.320
It's 1am.

52:53.320 --> 52:54.320
My name is Amy.

52:54.320 --> 52:56.320
My neighbors can definitely hear that.

52:56.320 --> 52:58.320
They know I have abnormal urges now.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.320
They already knew that.

53:00.320 --> 53:03.320
But offline, I'm an inconspicuous pussy,

53:03.320 --> 53:04.320
like a total coward.

53:04.320 --> 53:05.320
So,

53:05.320 --> 53:07.320
this was a rage thread

53:07.320 --> 53:09.320
and I apologize for tweeting it.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.320
Let's go back to Bug Angel.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.320
I'm kind of a conscientious objector

53:19.320 --> 53:21.320
to the practice of condemning someone

53:21.320 --> 53:23.320
based on a collage of their worst tweets

53:23.320 --> 53:24.320
taken out of context.

53:24.320 --> 53:27.320
But I definitely do have anxiety about this.

53:27.320 --> 53:29.320
Like, I think I'm doing the right thing

53:29.320 --> 53:31.320
by not condemning Buck as true scum and evil,

53:31.320 --> 53:34.320
but I mean, I could be wrong.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.320
What if I am basically sacrificing myself

53:36.320 --> 53:38.320
for the sake of a person who really is

53:38.320 --> 53:40.320
as bad as Twitter says?

53:40.320 --> 53:41.320
Maybe tomorrow he'll tweet,

53:41.320 --> 53:42.320
fuck non-binary people,

53:42.320 --> 53:44.320
and then I'll have fucked up.

53:44.320 --> 53:47.320
This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me.

53:47.320 --> 53:51.320
But I do believe that by refusing to participate

53:51.320 --> 53:52.320
in the anti-Buck Angel pilot,

53:52.320 --> 53:57.320
I am erring on the morally safer side of things.

53:57.320 --> 53:59.320
Because even if he is a little true scummy,

53:59.320 --> 54:02.320
excommunicating him from the trans community

54:02.320 --> 54:05.320
is still probably not the best approach to take.

54:05.320 --> 54:06.320
In my experience,

54:06.320 --> 54:09.320
when people accept binary but not non-binary trans people,

54:09.320 --> 54:12.320
it usually takes like a 30 minute conversation

54:12.320 --> 54:15.320
to win them over to some level of non-binary acceptance.

54:15.320 --> 54:17.320
And I'll give you a couple examples.

54:17.320 --> 54:19.320
The first time I was ever canceled,

54:19.320 --> 54:21.320
like totally trashed on Twitter,

54:21.320 --> 54:23.320
was back in 2017,

54:23.320 --> 54:25.320
when I had not yet medically transitioned,

54:25.320 --> 54:28.320
and at the time I identified as non-binary.

54:28.320 --> 54:30.320
And at VidCon 2017,

54:30.320 --> 54:33.320
I met up with a YouTuber named June,

54:33.320 --> 54:35.320
who had made some videos where she basically

54:35.320 --> 54:37.320
mocked the idea of non-binary people.

54:37.320 --> 54:41.320
And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June,

54:41.320 --> 54:42.320
and some other people,

54:42.320 --> 54:43.320
but let's keep them out of it.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.320
And people on Twitter totally dragged me

54:45.320 --> 54:47.320
for being a peak liberal bootlicker

54:47.320 --> 54:49.320
who's best friends with transphobic abusers.

54:49.320 --> 54:50.320
Christ.

54:51.320 --> 54:53.320
Fucking people, man.

54:53.320 --> 54:55.320
It's so fucking frustrating.

54:55.320 --> 54:56.320
And, you know,

54:56.320 --> 54:58.320
I'm not gonna claim I changed June's mind,

54:58.320 --> 55:00.320
because I don't know what her thought process was,

55:00.320 --> 55:03.320
but I did talk to her about non-binary identity,

55:03.320 --> 55:06.320
and she did remove her anti-non-binary videos.

55:06.320 --> 55:08.320
And I don't have any regrets about that brunch.

55:13.320 --> 55:14.320
Example two.

55:14.320 --> 55:15.320
A couple months later,

55:15.320 --> 55:19.320
I did a livestream with a conservative trans woman YouTuber

55:19.320 --> 55:20.320
named...

55:21.320 --> 55:23.320
What was her name?

55:23.320 --> 55:24.320
Sharon?

55:24.320 --> 55:25.320
Sharon?

55:25.320 --> 55:26.320
Was it Sharon?

55:26.320 --> 55:28.320
I guess she's just not a very memorable person.

55:28.320 --> 55:30.320
Anyway, she had made some videos saying

55:30.320 --> 55:32.320
that non-binary identities aren't real.

55:32.320 --> 55:33.320
But I gave her a chance,

55:33.320 --> 55:34.320
and she surprised me

55:34.320 --> 55:36.320
by being super compassionate and thoughtful.

55:36.320 --> 55:37.320
By the end of that stream,

55:37.320 --> 55:40.320
she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity.

55:40.320 --> 55:41.320
So again,

55:41.320 --> 55:43.320
the point is not that I'm some kind of persuasive genius.

55:43.320 --> 55:44.320
If I was a persuasive genius,

55:44.320 --> 55:47.320
maybe I could talk myself out of being canceled.

55:47.320 --> 55:49.320
The point is that sometimes,

55:49.320 --> 55:51.320
people who seem ignorant or hate me,

55:51.320 --> 55:54.320
just need to be given a non-judgmental space

55:54.320 --> 55:56.320
to learn and grow and think.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.320
And to just condemn them as hopeless bigots

55:58.320 --> 56:00.320
actually prevents that growth from happening.

56:00.320 --> 56:01.320
And Sharon,

56:01.320 --> 56:02.320
despite her, you know,

56:02.320 --> 56:04.320
totally forgettable personality,

56:04.320 --> 56:06.320
turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person.

56:06.320 --> 56:07.320
Like later on,

56:07.320 --> 56:09.320
she actually made an apology video to non-binary people,

56:09.320 --> 56:11.320
and I became good friends with her.

56:11.320 --> 56:14.320
And we worked together on most of the videos I've made this year.

56:14.320 --> 56:15.320
You know,

56:15.320 --> 56:16.320
until she ruined my life

56:16.320 --> 56:18.320
by recommending a canceled John Waters impersonator.

56:18.320 --> 56:19.320
I guess the moral is,

56:19.320 --> 56:20.320
NEVER

56:20.320 --> 56:22.320
talk to people you disagree with.

56:22.320 --> 56:24.320
It will only lead to pain.

56:33.320 --> 56:35.320
I do think there's something off with my hormone dose.

56:35.320 --> 56:36.320
Like,

56:36.320 --> 56:38.320
I'm crying three times a day.

56:38.320 --> 56:40.320
Oh, and I can't cum unless there's vibrators

56:40.320 --> 56:41.320
in at least three of my holes.

56:41.320 --> 56:43.320
It happens like once a month.

56:43.320 --> 56:44.320
There has to be a full moon.

56:44.320 --> 56:46.320
I honestly only still bother

56:46.320 --> 56:48.320
because it numbs the pain for a few moments.

56:48.320 --> 56:49.320
What I'm trying to say is,

56:49.320 --> 56:51.320
I really do believe in conversation,

56:51.320 --> 56:53.320
which means hearing out multiple perspectives.

56:53.320 --> 56:55.320
I don't want my audience to get all their information

56:55.320 --> 56:57.320
about trans people from me,

56:57.320 --> 56:59.320
and I think it's important to listen to criticism.

56:59.320 --> 57:01.320
So I encourage my audience to go watch

57:01.320 --> 57:03.320
some non-binary YouTubers

57:03.320 --> 57:05.320
who have criticized me and criticized Buck Angel.

57:05.320 --> 57:06.320
For example,

57:06.320 --> 57:10.320
go check out non-binary YouTuber Luxander's video about me,

57:10.320 --> 57:13.320
and non-binary YouTuber Corviday's video about Buck Angel.

57:13.320 --> 57:16.320
I think YouTube, as a platform,

57:16.320 --> 57:18.320
is better at producing criticism

57:18.320 --> 57:20.320
rather than canceling.

57:20.320 --> 57:21.320
And I think that's because,

57:21.320 --> 57:23.320
at least in the vlog format,

57:23.320 --> 57:26.320
making a video forces you to confront the fact

57:26.320 --> 57:29.320
that you're a human being with a face and a name

57:29.320 --> 57:32.320
who can be held accountable for the things that you say.

57:32.320 --> 57:33.320
But people on Twitter,

57:33.320 --> 57:34.320
it's a different story.

57:34.320 --> 57:35.320
And I think it's time we take a look

57:35.320 --> 57:37.320
at what canceling really is.

57:37.320 --> 57:39.320
I've given you enough context now

57:39.320 --> 57:41.320
for you to understand what I'm about to show you,

57:41.320 --> 57:44.320
which is what I saw on my timeline every day

57:44.320 --> 57:45.320
for nearly a month.

57:45.320 --> 57:47.320
All these tweets are from the aftermath

57:47.320 --> 57:49.320
of my uploading Opulence,

57:49.320 --> 57:50.320
two months ago,

57:50.320 --> 57:52.320
when the Buck Angel scandal first broke.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.320
And someone better hold my hand now,

57:54.320 --> 57:55.320
because this gets ugly.

57:58.320 --> 58:01.320
Hey, if any of you still support ContraPoints

58:01.320 --> 58:03.320
after her bigging up and collaborating

58:03.320 --> 58:05.320
with notable TERF favorite and true scum Buck Angel,

58:05.320 --> 58:07.320
you're no friend to gender non-conforming,

58:07.320 --> 58:10.320
non-passing, and non-binary trans people.

58:10.320 --> 58:11.320
Fuck her,

58:11.320 --> 58:13.320
and fuck her fucking rift.

58:13.320 --> 58:15.320
I am absolutely furious right now.

58:15.320 --> 58:17.320
Weird how I'm 30 and trans,

58:17.320 --> 58:18.320
and manage not to be a true scum.

58:18.320 --> 58:20.320
Maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly.

58:20.320 --> 58:23.320
Or maybe ContraPoints is a conniving rat fucking capo

58:23.320 --> 58:26.320
who could do with a fully wound backhand to the mouth.

58:26.320 --> 58:27.320
Since I'm out of Twitter jail now,

58:27.320 --> 58:28.320
I just want to say,

58:28.320 --> 58:30.320
fuck ContraPoints,

58:30.320 --> 58:31.320
her sycophantic stans,

58:31.320 --> 58:33.320
and all her bread tube chums

58:33.320 --> 58:34.320
who close ranks to protect her

58:34.320 --> 58:36.320
after she throws the rest of the trans community

58:36.320 --> 58:38.320
under the bus for profit.

58:38.320 --> 58:40.320
Natalie Nguyen is a fucking grifter.

58:40.320 --> 58:42.320
ContraPoints' videos are now just style over substance,

58:42.320 --> 58:45.320
so that explains why she took to TERF ideology so well.

58:45.320 --> 58:46.320
ContraPoints working with true scum,

58:46.320 --> 58:48.320
now definitively proves

58:48.320 --> 58:50.320
that pretty much everyone defending ContraPoints

58:50.320 --> 58:52.320
just hates enbies,

58:52.320 --> 58:53.320
and are also true scum.

58:53.320 --> 58:55.320
Legit gonna start on following peeps

58:55.320 --> 58:57.320
that continue to follow ContraPoints at this point.

58:57.320 --> 59:00.320
Do know my wording of pretty much everyone.

59:00.320 --> 59:01.320
I know there are some

59:01.320 --> 59:04.320
that were probably blindsided by this somehow.

59:04.320 --> 59:06.320
So long as you know that ContraPoints is true scum,

59:06.320 --> 59:08.320
you're safe and cool.

59:08.320 --> 59:09.320
Eat shit, Natalie.

59:09.320 --> 59:11.320
For someone who used to identify as genderqueer,

59:11.320 --> 59:13.320
we expected more from you,

59:13.320 --> 59:15.320
but I guess when your head's this far up your own ass,

59:15.320 --> 59:17.320
it's hard to consider others.

59:17.320 --> 59:20.320
ContraPoints, more like DisaPoints.

59:20.320 --> 59:21.320
That's a good one.

59:21.320 --> 59:23.320
If you're gonna drag me, at least be funny.

59:23.320 --> 59:24.320
Fuck Buck Angel.

59:24.320 --> 59:26.320
Fuck ContraPoints.

59:26.320 --> 59:28.320
Fuck any real transsexual.

59:28.320 --> 59:30.320
Fuck your grift.

59:30.320 --> 59:33.320
Here's what hashtag ContraPoints stands don't understand.

59:33.320 --> 59:35.320
If Natalie refuses to accept

59:35.320 --> 59:37.320
that she has an apology to make,

59:37.320 --> 59:39.320
and continues profiting from it,

59:39.320 --> 59:41.320
it will become our responsibility

59:41.320 --> 59:42.320
to work on deplatforming her

59:42.320 --> 59:44.320
just like every other racist, sexist,

59:44.320 --> 59:46.320
bigoted content creator.

59:46.320 --> 59:48.320
No one has actually suggested or attempted

59:48.320 --> 59:49.320
to actually cancel her,

59:49.320 --> 59:51.320
but the longer this goes on without an apology

59:51.320 --> 59:53.320
and commitment to do better,

59:53.320 --> 59:54.320
the stronger the case becomes

59:54.320 --> 59:57.320
for actively working to deplatform her.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.320
So, in other words,

59:58.320 --> 01:00:00.320
no one has suggested we cancel her,

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:02.320
but we should cancel her.

01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:03.320
Great.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.320
Can everyone finally agree

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.320
that ContraPoints belongs directly inside a garbage can?

01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.320
Here I am, sweetie.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:11.320
ContraPoints collaborating with Angel Buck.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.320
Angel Buck.

01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.320
Thanks for letting us all know

01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.320
that you had no idea who he even was

01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:20.320
until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about.

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.320
ContraPoints collaborating with Angel Buck,

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:25.320
a transmedicalist who once outed a trans person

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:27.320
to try and destroy them,

01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:28.320
and supporting him because

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.320
he looks and sounds like a proper man,

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.320
isn't a small, itty-bitty, tipsy-topsy fucking mistake.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:36.320
This is a huge deal.

01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:39.320
ContraPoints could be literally collaborating with Hitler.

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:42.320
We have a Hitler comparison.

01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:45.320
We could be literally collaborating with Hitler today.

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.320
And you all would be like,

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.320
oh, well, she's just a little flawed, you know.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.320
Fuck off.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:52.320
Can Natalie Wynne stop being a coward

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.320
and commit to being a transmed?

01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:56.320
It's really tiring to watch this happen every week.

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.320
Natalie Wynne is a spoiled brat

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.320
who refuses to take accountability.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.320
Anyone who supports Natalie Wynne

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.320
does not support nonbinary people.

01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:05.320
Natalie Wynne is such a terrible person.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:06.320
My God.

01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:09.320
Every cis and not nonbinary person

01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:11.320
who thought Natalie Wynne wasn't transmed

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:14.320
now owes me and every nonbinary person $50.

01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:16.320
Joe Biden has a better position on the validity

01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:18.320
of nonbinary gender than ContraPoints.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:22.320
My opinion is that ContraPoints really sucks a lot

01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:23.320
and I don't like her.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.320
I hate ContraPoints so goddamn much

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.320
it's unbelievable.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:28.320
ContraPoints be like,

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:30.320
let's hear some nonbinary people.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:32.320
This is a very good impression of me.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:33.320
You're doing very good, sweetie.

01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:35.320
You're doing very, very good.

01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:37.320
Buck Angel is a TERF apologizer,

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.320
bootlicker, and true scum.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.320
Any association with him

01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:42.320
must be seen as hostile

01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.320
to the trans community as a whole,

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:46.320
let alone denial of nonbinary existence.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.320
That's the line in the sand, folks.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.320
Where do you stand?

01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:53.320
And here we fucking are, dude.

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.320
Buck fucking Angel on ContraPoints.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.320
Eat my entire ass.

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.320
What?

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:02.320
What?

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.320
This is Natalie.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.320
Natalie is a transmedicalist.

01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:07.320
This is Natalie's friend Lindsay.

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.320
Lindsay is a leftuber.

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.320
Natalie and Lindsay are still friends

01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:13.320
because Natalie and Lindsay

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:15.320
are both cowards.

01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:17.320
Leftuber's a griff.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.320
Oh, and they made me the man.

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:19.320
The shade.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:21.320
Issues that arose with

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.320
being in Contra's new video.

01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:25.320
Her video on TERFs make no sense now.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.320
Her video on trans trenders make no sense now.

01:02:27.320 --> 01:02:30.320
You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.320
totally contradicts the videos

01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:34.320
I've spent hundreds of hours making,

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.320
do you think maybe your interpretation could be wrong?

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.320
Apparently not.

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.320
Her apology is completely void.

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.320
Sends a message that she hates non-binary people.

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.320
She is reckless with her content.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.320
Positives that arose from Buck Angel being in Contra's new video.

01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:52.320
She, uh, has $400,000 this month from Patreon.

01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.320
$400,000.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:57.320
This number is completely made up.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.320
Like, it is exponentially wrong.

01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.320
$400,000.

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.320
$400,000 a month.

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:04.320
Hot take.

01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:06.320
ContraPoints is the leftist PewDiePie.

01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.320
Personally, I like to characterize her

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:11.320
as the blair-white wolf in leftist sheep's clothing.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.320
Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece of shit

01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.320
who still has not apologized for platforming truescum

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.320
and is actively taking their side.

01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:22.320
Anyway, if you still support ContraPoints,

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.320
get the hell away from me.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.320
Pee-pee-poo-poo, I'm ContraPoints

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.320
and I can't stop being a transmedicalist

01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:30.320
and shitting myself in public.

01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:35.320
Valid criticisms of marginalized people.

01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.320
Fuck ContraPoints.

01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.320
Fuck truescum.

01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:40.320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

01:03:40.320 --> 01:03:42.320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:44.320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:49.320
You know, when you repeat the same fucking sentence

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.320
over and over again, it does...

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.320
You know when you repeat the same sentence over and over again,

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.320
it actually doesn't get more persuasive.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.320
In fact, it might get less persuasive.

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.320
Because true things usually only have to be said once.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:05.320
If you still support ContraPoints,

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:08.320
then follow me immediately and never interact with me again.

01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:11.320
In conclusion, fuck Natalie Nguyen

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.320
and fuck everything she has to say.

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.320
Okay, let's get started.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:30.320
So, that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets.

01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.320
And all of this, let me remind you,

01:04:32.320 --> 01:04:35.320
is over a ten second voiceover clip

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.320
in a 48 minute video

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:39.320
about a completely unrelated topic.

01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.320
Like, how do you work?

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.320
How do you create

01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:44.320
when a decision so trivial

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:47.320
can become the main event for weeks of your life?

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.320
And the tweets are just the beginning.

01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320
After that, there's the Reddit threads,

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320
and the YouTube comments,

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:53.320
and the Facebook discourse,

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.320
and the Medium posts,

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.320
and the Newsweek article.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.320
Opulence is a video

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.320
me and Theron spent hundreds of hours

01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.320
carefully piecing together.

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:02.320
I think it's my best video.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:04.320
And to have the response to it

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.320
completely overwhelmed by one minor casting decision

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:10.320
is heartbreaking and infuriating to me.

01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:12.320
And it's left me with much less energy

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.320
to create new things.

01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:14.320
But here's the thing,

01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:16.320
people on Twitter saying mean things about me

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.320
is not the worst of it.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:19.320
Not even close.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:22.320
Like, I'm a politically opinionated trans woman

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:24.320
who publicly transitioned

01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:26.320
while making anti-fascist content

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.320
on a notoriously right-wing platform.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.320
Sweaty, I am so used to reading

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.320
mean things about myself online,

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:36.320
most of you probably can't even begin to imagine

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:37.320
how used to it I am.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:40.320
And the way you psychologically survive in that situation

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:42.320
is you block the people and platforms

01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.320
who are harassing you,

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:44.320
and you pay it no mind.

01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:47.320
But there's some things you can't block.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:49.320
And a big one is you can't block people

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:51.320
from going after your friends and colleagues.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:54.320
And that is exactly what people did to me

01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:56.320
at the height of the Buck Angel incident.

01:05:56.320 --> 01:05:57.320
Lindsay Ellis,

01:05:57.320 --> 01:05:59.320
Ollie from Philosophy Tube,

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:00.320
and Hbomberguy

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.320
all got inundated with tweets

01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.320
demanding that they publicly disown me,

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.320
a person they've all been friends with for years,

01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320
or else.

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.320
In response to demands that she apologize,

01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:14.320
Lindsay released a statement where she said,

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.320
I was not involved in Opulence.

01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:18.320
My name was mentioned in it,

01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:20.320
but I did not participate in the production.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:23.320
Therefore, with regards to calls for me to apologize,

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:27.320
I have to ask, apologize for what?

01:06:27.320 --> 01:06:29.320
There is only one logical answer.

01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.320
Apologize for being friends with Natalie.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.320
And here's a response to her statement.

01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.320
I don't need to consider you my fucking friend

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:39.320
to disagree with beliefs you knowingly solicit

01:06:39.320 --> 01:06:40.320
or allow on your platform.

01:06:40.320 --> 01:06:41.320
Same with Contra.

01:06:41.320 --> 01:06:44.320
It just means you're willing to allow awful ideas

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.320
to fester for the sake of financial gain,

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:47.320
which is fine,

01:06:47.320 --> 01:06:50.320
but it makes you a piece of shit.

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:52.320
And here's a comment at Hbomberguy.

01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.320
I doubt that you were going to read this,

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:56.320
but can you please just tell us your thoughts

01:06:56.320 --> 01:06:57.320
on that whole situation

01:06:57.320 --> 01:07:01.320
so we could at least know that you were on our side?

01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:04.320
We don't want to have to cancel all of y'all

01:07:04.320 --> 01:07:06.320
and cause BreadTube to go into a schism

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:07.320
as a result of this.

01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:08.320
Thank you.

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.320
Nice YouTube channel you have there, friend.

01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.320
Would be a shame if someone canceled it.

01:07:15.320 --> 01:07:17.320
So fucking sinister.

01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:19.320
Oli of PhilosophyTube released his own statement

01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.320
affirming his support of non-binary people,

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:23.320
but adding,

01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:26.320
Sadly, I've also been harassed, threatened, doxxed,

01:07:26.320 --> 01:07:28.320
had my private life speculated on

01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.320
and my loved ones insulted,

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.320
and recognizing the feelings of those

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.320
who kindly raised their concerns in a polite way,

01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:36.320
I do not wish to legitimize the great many people

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:38.320
who use their hurt as a cover

01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:41.320
for unacceptable toxic and abusive behavior.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.320
And here are some responses to Oli.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:45.320
As a non-binary fan of yours,

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.320
I'm disappointed in this non-apology.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.320
Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for?

01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:53.320
Ever having associated with me?

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.320
Things we are going to criticize Oli PhilosophyTube for.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.320
Being a sniveling hypocritical piece of shit.

01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.320
Refusing to listen to trans people.

01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:04.320
Actively, openly, and repeatedly mocking the trans people

01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.320
he refuses to listen to.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:07.320
Thanks for the apology.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.320
Now stop endorsing contrapoints.

01:08:09.320 --> 01:08:12.320
Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:16.320
is demanding that cis people publicly condemn

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:21.320
a trans woman for loosely associating with another trans person.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.320
Does that strike anyone else as wildly inappropriate?

01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:25.320
Even Mia Mulder,

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.320
a trans woman who has never publicly associated with me,

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.320
got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Oli.

01:08:32.320 --> 01:08:35.320
You know, after he made the post discussing being doxxed and threatened.

01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.320
And just for that, she gets put on the enemy list.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.320
I'm sad to say that Mia is on the list

01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.320
of people that have stood by contrapoints

01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:46.320
as she has continued to be a bigoted piece of shit.

01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.320
To which Mia responds,

01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:49.320
stood by contrapoints?

01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:50.320
Jesus Christ.

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:52.320
No matter what I do, people call me out

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:54.320
and I'm not even related to the video

01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:55.320
and I don't even know Natalie.

01:08:55.320 --> 01:08:57.320
The chain of guilt by association

01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.320
is so long and twisted,

01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.320
I can barely even follow it.

01:09:01.320 --> 01:09:03.320
So they're going after Mia,

01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:05.320
who tweeted a heart at Oli,

01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:08.320
who failed to condemn me

01:09:08.320 --> 01:09:11.320
for my voiceover casting of Buck Angel,

01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:13.320
who was retweeted by a TERF.

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:16.320
We're only missing a couple degrees of separation

01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:18.320
before every living person on the planet Earth

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.320
is cancelled over the Buck Angel situation.

01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:23.320
And several colleagues of mine, by the way,

01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:25.320
Lindsay, Harry, Oli,

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:27.320
they all took a financial hit.

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.320
They've all lost some Patreon support.

01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:31.320
One of Lindsay's former supporters

01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:34.320
even demanded a $38 lifetime refund,

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.320
saying,

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:36.320
Dear Lindsay,

01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.320
I'm sorry for being pushy,

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:40.320
but I really am going to be needing a refund.

01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:43.320
I gave money to your operation

01:09:43.320 --> 01:09:44.320
under the pretense

01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:46.320
that you wouldn't do anything morally objectionable,

01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.320
and supporting contrapoints

01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.320
and blaming us for taking issue with that

01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:53.320
is, in my opinion, amoral.

01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.320
Please respond.

01:09:54.320 --> 01:09:56.320
I hope she sent it to them in pennies.

01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:57.320
So look,

01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.320
I'm very grateful to my colleagues

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.320
for sticking by me through all this,

01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:04.320
but I'm also aware that I'm becoming a burden

01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:06.320
to anyone who associates with me.

01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:08.320
I have no collaborators in this video.

01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:10.320
I'm working on this totally alone

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:14.320
because I'm aware of how radioactive I am right now,

01:10:14.320 --> 01:10:16.320
and I don't want to contaminate anyone else.

01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:19.320
During the height of this most recent cancelling,

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:22.320
a creator I admire DMed me to let me know,

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.320
I cut the shout out to you in my last video

01:10:24.320 --> 01:10:25.320
because I was nervous

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.320
to draw the ire of your detractors

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:29.320
who are getting genuinely scary,

01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:31.320
but I wouldn't want you to think I was disavowing you,

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.320
regardless of how many people are asking me to.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.320
Jesus Christ.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:40.320
The situation here is that any cis person who defends me,

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:42.320
or even associates with me in any way,

01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.320
will be labeled a transphobe.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.320
Any binary trans person who associates with me

01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:48.320
will be branded an enbyphobe.

01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:51.320
And any non-binary people who associate with me

01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.320
will be ostracized from their own community.

01:10:53.320 --> 01:10:54.320
So on the internet,

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.320
I find myself increasingly alone.

01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:59.320
I'm isolated by the harassment.

01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:01.320
And that is ultimately the point.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:03.320
To exile me from my community,

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:04.320
from any community.

01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:06.320
And it's all because I refuse to participate

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.320
in doing exactly that to Buck Angel.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:11.320
My experiences have made me so disillusioned

01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.320
with the idea that social media callouts

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:15.320
can lead to any kind of justice

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:18.320
that I've essentially sworn off participating in them.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.320
There's a fairly prominent figure in leftist politics

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:24.320
who I could absolutely hashtag immediately.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:26.320
But I'm never going to do it.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.320
Because I have no faith left

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:31.320
in the process of callout vigilante justice.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:34.320
And I'm not saying I'm totally against meetooing people,

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320
because I think in some cases,

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:38.320
it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do.

01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:39.320
But in my case,

01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.320
I feel like I just know too much

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:44.320
about the dark side of social media shaming

01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.320
to ever want to participate in it again.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.320
You know, I feel like the story would end up being

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:49.320
taken out of my control,

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:52.320
warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:54.320
It would end up just haunting me.

01:11:54.320 --> 01:11:56.320
It would end up just haunting both me

01:11:56.320 --> 01:11:58.320
and the person I'd be accusing,

01:11:58.320 --> 01:11:59.320
which in this case,

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.320
honestly,

01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:02.320
neither of us deserves.

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.320
So I'm just not willing to take that risk.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.320
Except maybe in some very extreme situation,

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.320
which this just isn't.

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.320
It's not worth it.

01:12:09.320 --> 01:12:10.320
And likewise,

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:12.320
when a mob is at my doorstep

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.320
demanding I condemn Buck Angel

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.320
to save myself from cancellation,

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.320
no!

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.320
I'm just not going to do that.

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.320
I'm a conscientious objector.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.320
I'm willing to go to Twitter jail for this.

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:25.320
Take me away, boys.

01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:34.320
If there's one thing I can't stand,

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:37.320
it's bread tube videos.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.320
Part eight and a half.

01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.320
The philosophy of being fucked in the ass.

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:43.320
Ugh.

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.320
I have done this to YouTube.

01:12:45.320 --> 01:12:46.320
And I'm sorry.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.320
So look,

01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.320
canceling is not criticism.

01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:51.320
It is not holding someone accountable.

01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:53.320
It is an attack

01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:54.320
on a human being.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:55.320
In this video,

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.320
I use the word canceling

01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:58.320
more or less synonymously

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.320
with what feminist Jo Freeman,

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.320
author of The Bitch Manifesto,

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.320
calls

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:03.320
trashing.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:04.320
And I've linked her essay,

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.320
The Dark Side of Sisterhood,

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.320
in the description.

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:09.320
It was originally published

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:11.320
in Ms. Magazine in 1976,

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:13.320
but it is a perfect description

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:16.320
of what goes on on trans Twitter today.

01:13:16.320 --> 01:13:17.320
It is not disagreement.

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:18.320
It is not conflict.

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:20.320
It is not opposition.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.320
These are perfectly ordinary phenomena

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:23.320
which,

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:24.320
when engaged in mutually,

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:25.320
honestly,

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:26.320
and not excessively,

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.320
are necessary to keep an organism

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:30.320
or organization healthy and active.

01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:33.320
Trashing is a particularly vicious form

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:35.320
of character assassination

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.320
which amounts to psychological rape.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:38.320
It is manipulative,

01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:39.320
dishonest,

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.320
and excessive.

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:41.320
It is occasionally disguised

01:13:41.320 --> 01:13:43.320
by the rhetoric of honest conflict

01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.320
or covered up by denying

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:47.320
that any disapproval exists at all.

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:48.320
But it is not done

01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:50.320
to expose disagreements

01:13:50.320 --> 01:13:51.320
or resolve differences.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.320
It is done

01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:54.320
to disparage and destroy.

01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:56.320
Whatever methods are used,

01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:57.320
trashing involves a violation

01:13:57.320 --> 01:13:58.320
of one's integrity,

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.320
a declaration of one's worthlessness,

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:03.320
and an impugning of one's motives.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:04.320
In effect,

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.320
what is attacked is not one's actions

01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:07.320
or one's ideas,

01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.320
but one's self.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.320
And that's what distinguishes

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.320
trashing,

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:13.320
bullying,

01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:14.320
or abuse

01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:15.320
from criticism

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:16.320
or holding accountable.

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.320
Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs.

01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:21.320
But when people are canceling me,

01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:22.320
they're not bringing up

01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:23.320
my problematic tweets

01:14:23.320 --> 01:14:24.320
because they want me

01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:26.320
to revise my beliefs.

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:27.320
No.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:28.320
What they're doing

01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:29.320
is accumulating evidence

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.320
to support the case

01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.320
they've decided to make

01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:34.320
that I am a horrible person

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:36.320
who must be shunned.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:37.320
You know, the only sense

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.320
in which I am,

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:39.320
as they like to say,

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.320
the new Blair White,

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:42.320
is that I think I actually have now

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.320
snatched Vanessa's crown

01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.320
as the most hated Tran

01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:47.320
on Tran Twitter.

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.320
Vanessa, I'm trying to feud with you.

01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.320
Feud with me, goddammit.

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.320
You can't have a one-sided feud.

01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:54.320
I don't want to be one of those

01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.320
trans YouTubers

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:57.320
that just drags other trans people all day

01:14:57.320 --> 01:14:58.320
and they never respond.

01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:00.320
That would be really pathetic.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.320
The new Lacey Green.

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.320
That's the other one.

01:15:02.320 --> 01:15:04.320
The newest in a series of women

01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:07.320
you've decided to treat like supervillains.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.320
Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hmm?

01:15:09.320 --> 01:15:12.320
And supervillain is the right word.

01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:14.320
Like, I'm the bad guy.

01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:15.320
Duh.

01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.320
I'm the enemy.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.320
And what do you do with the enemy?

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:20.320
Well, you disavow,

01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320
disown,

01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:22.320
deplatform,

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.320
and destroy.

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.320
As that one tweet put it,

01:15:24.320 --> 01:15:26.320
that's the line in the sand, folks.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.320
Where do you stand?

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.320
If you adequately demonstrate

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.320
your searing hatred of Natalie Wynne,

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:33.320
then you're safe and cool.

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.320
But if you don't,

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.320
you're on the wrong side of the line, sweaty.

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.320
And you, too, are now the enemy.

01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:42.320
Cancel culture trope seven.

01:15:42.320 --> 01:15:43.320
Dualism.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.320
Certain ancient religions

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.320
teach their followers

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.320
to understand the cosmos

01:15:48.320 --> 01:15:49.320
as a struggle

01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.320
between light and dark,

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.320
good and evil.

01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.320
And cancel culture

01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:55.320
does more or less the same thing.

01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:57.320
It's binary thinking.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.320
People are either good

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.320
or they're bad.

01:15:59.320 --> 01:16:00.320
And to add to that,

01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.320
essentialism.

01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:04.320
If a person says or does a bad thing,

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.320
we should interpret that

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.320
as the mask slipping,

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.320
as a momentary glimpse

01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.320
of their essential wickedness.

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320
And anyone who wants to remain good

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:13.320
had better be willing

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:15.320
to publicly condemn

01:16:15.320 --> 01:16:16.320
anyone the community

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.320
has decided is bad.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:19.320
There really is something

01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:20.320
dystopian about this.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:21.320
You have to be willing

01:16:21.320 --> 01:16:23.320
to accuse other people

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.320
to prove your own innocence.

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.320
That's the line in the sand, folks.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:28.320
Where do you stand?

01:16:28.320 --> 01:16:30.320
In the most extreme version of this,

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.320
all bad people are equally bad.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:34.320
So collaborating with true scum

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.320
means you may as well be true scum.

01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.320
And of course,

01:16:37.320 --> 01:16:38.320
being true scum

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:40.320
is tantamount to being a TERF.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:41.320
And on trans Twitter,

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:43.320
it is a known fact

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.320
that TERFs

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:45.320
are Nazis.

01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.320
And this implies that Nazis,

01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:48.320
TERFs,

01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:49.320
true scum,

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:50.320
people who associate

01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.320
with true scum,

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.320
people who fail to condemn

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:53.320
people who associate

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.320
with true scum,

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:56.320
people who offer emotional support

01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:57.320
to people who fail to condemn

01:16:57.320 --> 01:16:58.320
people who associate

01:16:58.320 --> 01:16:59.320
with true scum,

01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.320
all of them must be treated

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:02.320
the same way.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.320
De-platform her

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:04.320
just like every other racist,

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:05.320
sexist,

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.320
bigoted content creator.

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.320
A fully wound backhand

01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.320
to the mouth.

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:11.320
I recently read a book

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.320
by Sarah Schulman

01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:14.320
called Conflict Is Not Abuse.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:15.320
Overstating harm,

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:16.320
community responsibility,

01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:18.320
and the duty of repair.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.320
Basically,

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.320
Schulman's argument

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:22.320
is that in various contexts,

01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.320
from romantic relationships

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.320
to community infighting

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:27.320
to international politics,

01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:29.320
the overstatement of harm

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.320
is used as a justification

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:32.320
for cruelty

01:17:32.320 --> 01:17:34.320
and for escalating conflict.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:35.320
So for example,

01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.320
and this is my example,

01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:37.320
not Schulman's,

01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:39.320
TERFs fixate

01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:41.320
on the exaggerated danger

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.320
that trans women supposedly pose

01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:44.320
to cis women.

01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:45.320
And in very classic

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:46.320
overstatement of harm,

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.320
they'll describe everything

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.320
they don't like

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:50.320
as rape.

01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.320
Trans women entering

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.320
women's spaces

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:53.320
is rape.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:54.320
Trans women existing,

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:55.320
Janice Raymond,

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.320
is rape.

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:57.320
And then they use

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:58.320
that exaggerated harm

01:17:58.320 --> 01:17:59.320
as a justification

01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:01.320
to retaliate against them,

01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:04.320
to dox and harass and shun.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.320
Well, the same kind of logic

01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:06.320
is used to justify

01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.320
abusive behavior

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:09.320
within the trans community.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:10.320
The dualistic thinking,

01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:12.320
the essentialism,

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:13.320
the pseudo-moralism.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.320
All of this allows people

01:18:14.320 --> 01:18:15.320
on Twitter

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.320
to treat me

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:18.320
in an obviously abusive way,

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:20.320
all the while feeling

01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:22.320
like they're doing the right thing

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:23.320
because they're attacking

01:18:23.320 --> 01:18:24.320
the enemy.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.320
And I realize that some people

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:26.320
will say that I'm the one

01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:28.320
who's overstating harm

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.320
to evade criticism.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.320
Well look,

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:31.320
you've seen the tweets,

01:18:31.320 --> 01:18:32.320
the furious demands

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.320
for me to be exiled,

01:18:33.320 --> 01:18:35.320
the doxing and threatening

01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.320
and ordering around

01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:37.320
of my colleagues,

01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:38.320
the attempts to isolate me

01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:39.320
from my community,

01:18:39.320 --> 01:18:40.320
the attacks not on my actions

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.320
but on who I am as a person.

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:43.320
There's not really anything

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.320
ambiguous about this,

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.320
it's just abuse.

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.320
But I don't think it feels

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.320
like abuse to the people

01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:49.320
who are doing it.

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.320
They feel like they're punching up

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:55.320
because I'm a celebrity

01:18:55.320 --> 01:18:56.320
with a platform

01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:58.320
and lots of Twitter followers.

01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:00.320
And it's true that I do have more power

01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:02.320
than any of them individually.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.320
But as a collective,

01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.320
they have a terrifying power

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:08.320
that they don't seem to be aware of

01:19:08.320 --> 01:19:09.320
as individuals.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:11.320
As John Ronson,

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:12.320
author of a great book

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.320
on public shaming put it,

01:19:13.320 --> 01:19:14.320
I suppose that when

01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:15.320
shamings are delivered

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.320
like remotely administered

01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.320
drone strikes,

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.320
nobody needs to think

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:19.320
about how ferocious

01:19:19.320 --> 01:19:21.320
our collective power might be.

01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.320
The snowflake never needs

01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:24.320
to feel responsible

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:25.320
for the avalanche.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.320
And that's how you get

01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320
these situations

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.320
where you have hundreds

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:30.320
of people endlessly bashing

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.320
someone who's already

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.320
been knocked to the ground

01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.320
and feeling all the while

01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:36.320
like they're punching up.

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.320
You know, there's actually

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:39.320
a kind of power and safety

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:41.320
in anonymity and obscurity.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:42.320
And there are many ways

01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.320
that being a public figure

01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:46.320
makes you really vulnerable.

01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:47.320
For example, you're more vulnerable

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.320
to doxing, stalking, and harassment

01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.320
on a scale that most people

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.320
probably can't even imagine.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.320
You're vulnerable to having

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:58.320
your reputation permanently degraded

01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:00.320
in a way that people who are

01:20:00.320 --> 01:20:01.320
posting anonymously

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.320
or pseudonymously

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.320
are pretty much invulnerable to.

01:20:04.320 --> 01:20:05.320
And a lot of the people

01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.320
who are attacking me,

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:08.320
they're not pausing to self-reflect.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:10.320
They're not holding themselves

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.320
accountable for the consequences

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.320
of their actions.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:14.320
They're just venting

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:16.320
their unfiltered rage.

01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:18.320
But in response to these attacks,

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:20.320
I, as a powerful person

01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.320
with a platform,

01:20:21.320 --> 01:20:23.320
I'm not allowed to react

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.320
like a human being.

01:20:24.320 --> 01:20:26.320
I'm not allowed to get angry.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:27.320
I'm not allowed to show pain.

01:20:27.320 --> 01:20:29.320
I'm not allowed to get defensive.

01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320
I'm not allowed to lash out.

01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.320
All I'm allowed to do is

01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:34.320
go totally numb on the inside

01:20:34.320 --> 01:20:36.320
as I try to frantically calculate

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:39.320
the ideal public relations response

01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:40.320
that pays due deference

01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.320
to the valid concerns

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.320
of these poor marginalized people,

01:20:43.320 --> 01:20:45.320
all the while ignoring

01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:47.320
the tsunami of verbal abuse

01:20:47.320 --> 01:20:48.320
that's crashing over me.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.320
You know, people on Twitter,

01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:52.320
they don't try to persuade me

01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:53.320
like I'm a human being.

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:55.320
They order me around.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.320
They tell me what to believe.

01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:58.320
They demand that I say

01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.320
exactly what they want me to say

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:01.320
or else.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.320
It's extremely objectifying.

01:21:03.320 --> 01:21:05.320
They don't treat me like a person

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.320
with my own opinions and feelings.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:08.320
They treat me as this like

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.320
brand

01:21:09.320 --> 01:21:11.320
of moral commodity

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.320
to be consumed or denounced.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.320
And this is all terribly ironic

01:21:15.320 --> 01:21:17.320
because of the conflicting demand

01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.320
that creators be authentic

01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.320
all the time.

01:21:20.320 --> 01:21:21.320
One thing that always frustrates me

01:21:21.320 --> 01:21:23.320
about these situations

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.320
is there's this demand

01:21:24.320 --> 01:21:27.320
that you apologize instantly

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:28.320
and there's this perception

01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:30.320
that a fast apology

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.320
is more sincere than a delayed one.

01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.320
But in fact,

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.320
the opposite is true.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.320
It takes longer than a couple hours

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:37.320
to cool down,

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:38.320
lower your defenses,

01:21:38.320 --> 01:21:40.320
listen,

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.320
learn,

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:42.320
grow,

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.320
seriously reflect

01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.320
on what you may have done

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.320
or said that was wrong.

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:47.320
That can take days

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.320
or weeks

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:49.320
or months.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.320
I had to do my October AMA stream

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:52.320
for Patreon

01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:54.320
and at the beginning of the stream,

01:21:54.320 --> 01:21:56.320
I gave my emotional

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.320
half-formed reaction

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:00.320
to the Buck Angel situation.

01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:02.320
And some traitor

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.320
on my Patreon

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:06.320
transcribed

01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.320
that part of the stream

01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:09.320
and disseminated it on Twitter

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:10.320
just to instigate

01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:11.320
another round of canceling.

01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:12.320
You're not allowed a chance

01:22:12.320 --> 01:22:14.320
to think or feel.

01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:16.320
And because supposedly

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:17.320
the best thing to do

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.320
from a PR perspective

01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:20.320
is to apologize immediately,

01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:21.320
canceling produces

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:23.320
a lot of insincere

01:22:23.320 --> 01:22:24.320
bullshit apologies

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:26.320
from people who haven't in fact

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.320
learned anything.

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:28.320
And I think most people

01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:29.320
are aware of that.

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:30.320
In fact,

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.320
I think the demand

01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:33.320
for an apology itself

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:34.320
is often insincere.

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:36.320
If you're being canceled

01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:38.320
rather than criticized,

01:22:38.320 --> 01:22:40.320
then the line in the sand

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:41.320
has been drawn.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:42.320
You and all your kin

01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:43.320
have been declared

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:44.320
the enemy.

01:22:44.320 --> 01:22:46.320
Apologize to Twitter.

01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:47.320
At this point,

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:48.320
I may as well apologize

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.320
to 4chan.

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:50.320
Dear 4chan,

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:52.320
I am super fucking sorry

01:22:52.320 --> 01:22:53.320
I called you

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.320
thin-wristed otaku shit weasels

01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:56.320
who like looking at pictures

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.320
of little girls.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:58.320
I have been trying

01:22:58.320 --> 01:22:59.320
to educate myself

01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.320
and learn from my mistakes

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.320
and I now realize

01:23:02.320 --> 01:23:04.320
that's only 70% of you.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.320
Like, once you're canceled,

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:07.320
you can really do no right.

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.320
If you apologize,

01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:10.320
the apology will be declared

01:23:10.320 --> 01:23:11.320
a manipulative attempt

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.320
to save face

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.320
and in fact,

01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.320
it will be used

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.320
as further evidence

01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320
of what a Machiavellian

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:18.320
psychopath you really are.

01:23:18.320 --> 01:23:19.320
If you try to explain

01:23:19.320 --> 01:23:20.320
or defend yourself,

01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:21.320
I mean, first of all,

01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:22.320
you'll almost certainly

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.320
dig yourself in deeper.

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:24.320
But even if you're

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:26.320
articulate and correct,

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:27.320
you'll still be seen

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.320
as unable to take criticism

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:30.320
and as ignoring the hurt

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.320
of marginalized people.

01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:33.320
And if you just go silent,

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.320
you'll be seen as a coward

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.320
fleeing accountability.

01:23:36.320 --> 01:23:37.320
Even though there's

01:23:37.320 --> 01:23:38.320
lots of reasons

01:23:38.320 --> 01:23:39.320
why you might go silent.

01:23:39.320 --> 01:23:40.320
Maybe you're taking

01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:41.320
a few days away

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.320
from social media

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:43.320
to try to cool down

01:23:43.320 --> 01:23:44.320
and think clearly.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.320
Or maybe,

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:46.320
you're so overwhelmed

01:23:46.320 --> 01:23:47.320
by the harassment

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:49.320
that you've just shut down.

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.320
Let's do shots.

01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:57.320
Who wants to do a shot with me?

01:23:57.320 --> 01:23:58.320
Do you want to do a shot with me?

01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:00.320
Let's do a shot.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.320
A tequila shot is my favorite.

01:24:02.320 --> 01:24:03.320
I like the whole

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:06.320
salt, tequila, lime ritual.

01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:09.320
It's just very satisfying to me.

01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:12.320
It's the end of that bottle.

01:24:12.320 --> 01:24:13.320
Okay.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:15.320
Let's get started.

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.320
You feel warm right away.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.320
You know that feeling

01:24:23.320 --> 01:24:24.320
where it's like,

01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:27.320
oh, hey, how are you, happiness?

01:24:27.320 --> 01:24:29.320
Hey, how are you?

01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:31.320
Feeling that life is worth living?

01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.320
It's a good moment.

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.320
You're like, oh, this is good.

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:34.320
This is okay.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.320
This is gonna be okay.

01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:36.320
I can get through this.

01:24:36.320 --> 01:24:37.320
It's how it starts.

01:24:37.320 --> 01:24:38.320
Watch out for that.

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:39.320
So look,

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.320
I really don't like

01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:41.320
to represent myself

01:24:41.320 --> 01:24:42.320
as a victim.

01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.320
That's not really a narrative

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:46.320
that I identify with.

01:24:46.320 --> 01:24:47.320
But for the purposes

01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:48.320
of communicating

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.320
what effect canceling has,

01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:52.320
I feel like I should say something

01:24:52.320 --> 01:24:54.320
about the pain.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:55.320
Much of the happiness

01:24:55.320 --> 01:24:57.320
that you might expect

01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.320
to come along with success

01:24:58.320 --> 01:25:01.320
has been taken away from me

01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.320
by this constant need

01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:05.320
and fury that surrounds me.

01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:07.320
Try to think about this rationally.

01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.320
I'm a Libra Sun, Pisces Moon.

01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:11.320
Being canceled is hell for me.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:12.320
You know,

01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:14.320
I want to be liked by everyone.

01:25:14.320 --> 01:25:17.320
And I'm starting to think

01:25:17.320 --> 01:25:19.320
I might be in the wrong career for that.

01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:20.320
In a way,

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.320
leftist Twitter finally accomplished

01:25:22.320 --> 01:25:25.320
what 4chan, Nazis, stalkers, and TERFs

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.320
have been trying and failing to do to me

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:28.320
for years.

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.320
They've made Twitter into a platform

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:32.320
so hostile to my existence

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.320
that I've decided to leave it forever.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.320
And they demoralized me to the point

01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:38.320
I could barely get out of bed for a month.

01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.320
And I know that sounds really melodramatic,

01:25:40.320 --> 01:25:43.320
but I'm just trying to be honest with you

01:25:43.320 --> 01:25:46.320
about what a melodramatic person I am.

01:25:46.320 --> 01:25:48.320
I find I have trouble convincing people

01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.320
of the severity of the pain

01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:51.320
that being canceled causes

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:54.320
because I think it's just hard to imagine

01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:56.320
if you haven't been through it yourself.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:57.320
And I don't know a more succinct way

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:58.320
to convey it to you

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.320
than by telling you that

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:01.320
in the last few years,

01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:03.320
I've been harassed by Nazis,

01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:04.320
I've been harassed by TERFs,

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.320
I've been stalked,

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:06.320
I've been doxxed,

01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.320
I've been threatened,

01:26:07.320 --> 01:26:09.320
I've been sexually assaulted.

01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.320
And the pain of being canceled,

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.320
of being totally trashed

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.320
by other trans people online for years,

01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.320
has been more difficult for me to cope with

01:26:17.320 --> 01:26:19.320
than all the rest of it combined.

01:26:19.320 --> 01:26:21.320
Joe Freeman actually describes how I feel

01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.320
better than I think I can describe it myself.

01:26:23.320 --> 01:26:25.320
I was one of the first in the country,

01:26:25.320 --> 01:26:27.320
perhaps the first in Chicago,

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.320
to have my character,

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:29.320
my commitment,

01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.320
and my very self attacked

01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:32.320
in such a way by movement women

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:34.320
that it left me torn in little pieces

01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:36.320
and unable to function.

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.320
It took me years to recover,

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:38.320
and even today the wounds

01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:39.320
have not entirely healed.

01:26:39.320 --> 01:26:41.320
This attack is accomplished

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.320
by making you feel

01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:43.320
that your very existence

01:26:43.320 --> 01:26:45.320
is inimical to the movement

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:47.320
and that nothing can change this

01:26:47.320 --> 01:26:49.320
short of ceasing to exist.

01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.320
These feelings are reinforced

01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.320
when you are isolated from your friends

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.320
as they become convinced

01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:55.320
that their association with you

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.320
is similarly inimical to the movement

01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.320
and to themselves.

01:26:58.320 --> 01:26:59.320
Any support of you

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:00.320
will taint them.

01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:02.320
Eventually all your colleagues join in

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.320
in a chorus of condemnation

01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:05.320
which cannot be silenced

01:27:05.320 --> 01:27:07.320
and you are reduced to a mere parody

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.320
of your previous self.

01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:12.320
Yeah, that just about sums it up.

01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:13.320
Now as it happens,

01:27:13.320 --> 01:27:14.320
I am going to survive this

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:17.320
because I have very deliberately built

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.320
a support network that will be there for me

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:23.320
regardless of what online trans communities say.

01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.320
And I have very deliberately done that

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:28.320
because early in my transition back in 2017

01:27:28.320 --> 01:27:31.320
I relied very heavily

01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:33.320
on the online leftist trans community

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:35.320
for all kinds of emotional support.

01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:37.320
You know, when you're early in transition

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.320
I mean, it just sucks.

01:27:39.320 --> 01:27:41.320
You feel like the whole world is against you.

01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:42.320
And I talked about this a little bit

01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:44.320
in my last video, you know,

01:27:44.320 --> 01:27:45.320
feeling like a freak show

01:27:45.320 --> 01:27:46.320
walking down the street.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.320
And even if you're lucky enough

01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320
to have a supportive family,

01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.320
like, it usually still is going to take them

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.320
a while to come around.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:53.320
At first they don't get it.

01:27:53.320 --> 01:27:55.320
They say things to you like,

01:27:55.320 --> 01:27:57.320
aren't you worried you'll regret this?

01:27:57.320 --> 01:27:59.320
And like, they struggle with your name and pronouns,

01:27:59.320 --> 01:28:00.320
which is understandable.

01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.320
But at the same time,

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:04.320
it makes you feel like you're not being seen

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.320
for who you are.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.320
So you need a kind of second family

01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.320
that understands how you're feeling

01:28:09.320 --> 01:28:11.320
and acts happy about your transition

01:28:11.320 --> 01:28:12.320
and validates your gender.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:15.320
And for the first couple months of my transition,

01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:19.320
I found that in this world of online transgender leftism.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.320
Well, that didn't last long because,

01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:22.320
well, I was what,

01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.320
two months into my transition when

01:28:24.320 --> 01:28:26.320
first I did an interview with the journalist

01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:27.320
Jessie Single,

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.320
and then I agreed to do a debate

01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:30.320
with Theron and Vanessa.

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.320
So that's a long story,

01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:32.320
but in short,

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:34.320
I associated with a string of people

01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:37.320
that trans Twitter considers the enemy.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.320
And trans Twitter tore me apart over this.

01:28:39.320 --> 01:28:41.320
And it completely broke my heart

01:28:41.320 --> 01:28:44.320
because I was really leaning

01:28:44.320 --> 01:28:47.320
on basically emotional support

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:48.320
from strangers online,

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:50.320
which seems really stupid in retrospect.

01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:52.320
And after they turned against me,

01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:53.320
I decided one,

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:54.320
that I was never going to rely

01:28:54.320 --> 01:28:55.320
on this group of people again.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.320
And two,

01:28:56.320 --> 01:28:59.320
that I was going to have to find acceptance elsewhere.

01:28:59.320 --> 01:29:00.320
And in retrospect,

01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:02.320
I think this actually may have been good for me

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:03.320
in a roundabout way

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:05.320
because I was kicked out of the safe space

01:29:05.320 --> 01:29:07.320
and I dropped that mentality.

01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:08.320
And so basically,

01:29:08.320 --> 01:29:10.320
I was thrown into the deep end of reality

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.320
and forced to sink or swim.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:13.320
And I don't know if my transition

01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:15.320
or my channel would be where they are today

01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:17.320
if it hadn't been for that trial by fire.

01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.320
Are we swimming through fire

01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.320
or are we mixing metaphors?

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:24.320
The point is I'm more armored against canceling

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.320
than I was two years ago.

01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.320
And the reason why is I have acquired

01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:29.320
a certain level of privilege and security

01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.320
and independence from any one community

01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.320
so that if one community cancels me,

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.320
I still have somewhere else to go.

01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:36.320
You know,

01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:38.320
the people who are most vulnerable to cancel culture

01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:40.320
are not white guy comedians.

01:29:40.320 --> 01:29:41.320
They're not James Charles.

01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:42.320
They're not me.

01:29:42.320 --> 01:29:44.320
They are marginalized people

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:46.320
who feel like they have nowhere else to go

01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.320
when they're rejected by their community.

01:29:47.320 --> 01:29:50.320
That means struggling trans people

01:29:50.320 --> 01:29:51.320
with a few hundred Twitter followers.

01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:53.320
It means a lot of sex workers.

01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:54.320
It means people

01:29:54.320 --> 01:29:57.320
who totally rely on activist circles

01:29:57.320 --> 01:29:59.320
for emotional and material support.

01:29:59.320 --> 01:30:01.320
I'll quote Joe Freeman one more time.

01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.320
I had survived my youth

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:04.320
because I had never given anyone

01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:06.320
or any group the right to judge me.

01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:08.320
That right I had reserved to myself.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.320
But the movement seduced me

01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.320
by its sweet promise of sisterhood.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.320
It claimed to provide a haven

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:16.320
from the ravages of a sexist society,

01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.320
a place where one would be understood.

01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:21.320
It was my very need for feminism and feminists

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.320
that made me vulnerable.

01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:26.320
I gave the movement the right to judge me

01:30:26.320 --> 01:30:27.320
because I trusted it.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.320
And when it judged me worthless,

01:30:29.320 --> 01:30:31.320
I accepted that judgment.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:33.320
There's a really irritating point

01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:35.320
that people on the left like to make that goes,

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:38.320
well, canceling doesn't really end anyone's career.

01:30:38.320 --> 01:30:40.320
Canceled people usually get a new job

01:30:40.320 --> 01:30:41.320
or keep their platform.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:44.320
So I guess it's not really that bad, huh?

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.320
I think people say this

01:30:45.320 --> 01:30:48.320
because they're trying to mitigate any sense of guilt

01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:50.320
they might feel about how they're treating people

01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.320
because it's a really stupid argument.

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:54.320
There's lots of things that don't end your life

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.320
that are still terrible.

01:30:55.320 --> 01:30:57.320
But also, there's cases where canceling

01:30:57.320 --> 01:30:59.320
has ended someone's life.

01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:01.320
On December 5th, 2017,

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:03.320
a porn star named August Ames

01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:05.320
killed herself by hanging in a public park

01:31:05.320 --> 01:31:07.320
after being canceled on Twitter

01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:09.320
over a homophobic tweet.

01:31:09.320 --> 01:31:11.320
On December 3rd, she tweeted,

01:31:11.320 --> 01:31:13.320
Whichever lady is replacing me tomorrow

01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.320
for erotica x news,

01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.320
you're shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:17.320
just to let you know.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:19.320
BS is all I can say, shrug.

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.320
Do agents really not care about who they're representing?

01:31:21.320 --> 01:31:24.320
LA Direct, I do my homework for my body.

01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:26.320
So I've never worked in porn,

01:31:26.320 --> 01:31:28.320
so I can't really tell you what the norms are

01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:32.320
around women working with men who have done gay porn.

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:34.320
But the tweet certainly sounds homophobic to me,

01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:36.320
and that seemed to be the consensus

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:38.320
of other industry people on Twitter.

01:31:38.320 --> 01:31:39.320
So Twitter did its thing.

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:42.320
People in August's community called her a homophobe

01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:43.320
and lashed out at her.

01:31:43.320 --> 01:31:44.320
And as always happens,

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.320
plenty of passersby jumped in

01:31:46.320 --> 01:31:48.320
to throw tomatoes at the woman in the stocks.

01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:49.320
Over the next few days,

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.320
August tweeted several more times,

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.320
going through the usual stages that you go through

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:54.320
when you're being canceled.

01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.320
First, she defended herself.

01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.320
She claimed most other women in the industry

01:31:58.320 --> 01:31:59.320
feel the same as her.

01:31:59.320 --> 01:32:01.320
Then she said she's bisexual,

01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:03.320
and therefore she couldn't be homophobic.

01:32:03.320 --> 01:32:05.320
Then she said, fine, August will be fake

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:06.320
and not have opinions then.

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:08.320
Then she started bemoaning how mean Twitter is.

01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.320
And she got really defensive

01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:11.320
about her right to choose who she has sex with.

01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:14.320
And she lashed out at the people attacking her.

01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:16.320
And then in her final tweet,

01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:18.320
she just said, fuck y'all,

01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:20.320
and went to the park that night and killed herself.

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:23.320
This is all so familiar to me.

01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:25.320
I feel like I'm able to relive with her

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.320
each stage of this emotional process.

01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.320
There's that first moment

01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.320
when you realize the outrage is beginning

01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.320
and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach.

01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:35.320
And then the anger, feeling misunderstood.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:37.320
And then the bargaining, the fear,

01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.320
and finally the shame and the despair.

01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.320
And here's the thing,

01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:42.320
I totally agree with her critics

01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:44.320
that her tweet was bad.

01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:46.320
Of course she has the right to say no for any reason,

01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:50.320
but she publicly expressed this in a homophobic way.

01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.320
But she was still a person who deserves to live.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:55.320
And I think there's gotta be a better way

01:32:55.320 --> 01:32:57.320
to deal with these situations

01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.320
than just trashing someone until they kill themselves.

01:33:00.320 --> 01:33:01.320
And I know it's never as simple

01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.320
as Twitter made her kill herself.

01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:06.320
There's always other things going on in the background.

01:33:06.320 --> 01:33:07.320
But the point I'm making is,

01:33:07.320 --> 01:33:10.320
canceling is more dangerous to marginalized people

01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:13.320
because marginalized people generally have more things

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:15.320
going on in the background.

01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:18.320
John Ronson did an investigative podcast about her death

01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:20.320
and it goes into how she was saved

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.320
and sexually abused as a child, abandoned by her father.

01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.320
She was living with a boyfriend

01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:26.320
she was kind of emotionally detached from.

01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:27.320
And a few weeks earlier,

01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:28.320
she'd filmed a scene with a guy

01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:31.320
who was unnecessarily rough and mean

01:33:31.320 --> 01:33:32.320
and who mistreated her.

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:34.320
So she was kind of traumatized by that.

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.320
And so she was kind of on edge

01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.320
and really defensive about who she worked with

01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:39.320
when she was tweeting.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:41.320
Then the backlash happened.

01:33:41.320 --> 01:33:44.320
And since she had no other support network,

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:46.320
she probably felt like the only community she had

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:47.320
turned against her.

01:33:47.320 --> 01:33:49.320
And that's a really painful feeling.

01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:52.320
She must have felt so despised.

01:33:52.320 --> 01:33:55.320
Which is how I've felt for the last two months.

01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:59.320
I feel despised and burdensome.

01:33:59.320 --> 01:34:02.320
And I can imagine how a person who feels that way

01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:04.320
could have an impulsive couple hours

01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:07.320
where they think their best option is suicide.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:08.320
I mean, I can more than imagine it

01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:10.320
because I've been there myself.

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:11.320
And I'm still here

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:12.320
because at those moments,

01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:15.320
I've been with good friends who took care of me.

01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:16.320
And by friends,

01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.320
I do mean Xanax.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:21.320
But I've also survived because

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.320
there's a lot of people on the internet

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.320
who'd be very entertained if I killed myself.

01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:28.320
And I simply refuse to give them the satisfaction.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320
Oh no, bitch.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:32.320
I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite.

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.320
I mean, who needs a guardian angel

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.320
when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas

01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:38.320
on the fumes of total contempt?

01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:40.320
What I'm really trying to say is,

01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:43.320
Merry Christmas, you goddamn assholes.

01:34:48.320 --> 01:35:04.320
Oh, holy night.

01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:11.320
The stars are brightly shining.

01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:14.320
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:17.320
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:18.320
Meow.

01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.320
Meow, meow.

01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.320
To get my lesbian pliers out again.

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:31.320
Have a super fucking happy New Year, George.

01:35:31.320 --> 01:35:34.320
How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment?

01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:36.320
Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub?

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:38.320
Leave a comment if you want a bathtub.

01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:40.320
All right, I need to take a deep breath

01:35:40.320 --> 01:35:41.320
because let's be honest,

01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:42.320
I'm about one crack away

01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:45.320
from attacking my own Twitter followers with an umbrella.

01:35:45.320 --> 01:35:47.320
I am about one breakdown away

01:35:47.320 --> 01:35:48.320
from going on a rampage

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:50.320
and making a suit out of women's skin.

01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:51.320
Just kidding.

01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.320
I would never do that.

01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:53.320
Though on a bad skin day,

01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:55.320
I've given it serious consideration.

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:57.320
Oh, I'll be fine.

01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.320
I've gotta sober up anyway

01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:01.320
because I'm having more plastic surgery in a couple days.

01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.320
And plastic surgery,

01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:06.320
that's about the only thing holding me together at this point.

01:36:06.320 --> 01:36:07.320
What?

01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.320
YouTubing?

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.320
This is a healthy profession.

01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:11.320
This is great.

01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:12.320
Anyone want my job?

01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.320
Step right up.

01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:15.320
All you have to do is make informative

01:36:15.320 --> 01:36:16.320
and entertaining videos

01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:18.320
about extremely controversial topics

01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:19.320
while, of course,

01:36:19.320 --> 01:36:21.320
representing the full range of experiences

01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:23.320
in the LGBTQIAA plus spectrum

01:36:23.320 --> 01:36:26.320
and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny.

01:36:26.320 --> 01:36:27.320
Well, go on.

01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.320
I'm waiting to be entertained.

01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.320
Feed me, mother.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.320
Oh, don't mind me.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.320
I'll just sit back

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:34.320
and pour another glass of wine.

01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.320
Oh, and I will, of course,

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.320
be obsessively scrutinizing

01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.320
every word you say

01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:40.320
for any hint of moral transgression

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.320
as well as critiquing your look,

01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:43.320
you third-rate cross-dresser.

01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:44.320
Zero out of ten.

01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:45.320
Get off my stage.

01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.320
He successfully spilled that everywhere.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.320
It's good.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.320
I do still want to talk about

01:36:50.320 --> 01:36:51.320
why people cancel

01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.320
and the effect that it's having,

01:36:52.320 --> 01:36:54.320
but it looks like there's gonna have to be

01:36:54.320 --> 01:36:55.320
a part two gorge

01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:57.320
because I have hit my limit.

01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:59.320
So why don't we all cut our losses

01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:01.320
and try again in 2020, hm?

01:37:01.320 --> 01:37:02.320
I realize that people on Twitter

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:04.320
aren't actually gonna watch this video.

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.320
They're just gonna make fun of the title

01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:07.320
and how long it is.

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:08.320
Which, fair enough,

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:09.320
but they're the ones

01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:10.320
whose accusations against me

01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.320
are so numerous and convoluted

01:37:12.320 --> 01:37:14.320
it required a feature-length film

01:37:14.320 --> 01:37:15.320
to respond to.

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:16.320
But yeah, they're gonna see the title

01:37:16.320 --> 01:37:17.320
and they're gonna transcribe

01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:19.320
quotes out of context

01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:20.320
and they're gonna say

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.320
I'm a fascist,

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:22.320
I'm a TERF,

01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:23.320
I'm true scum,

01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.320
I'm the new Blair White,

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.320
I'm the new Lacey Green,

01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:26.320
I'm a cis bootlicker,

01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:28.320
I'm an enlightened centrist,

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:29.320
I'm a shitlib,

01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:30.320
I'm alt-right,

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.320
I'm a heartless grifter

01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:32.320
raking in millions of dollars

01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.320
over the bodies of dead trans women.

01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:35.320
Mask off.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:36.320
Yikes.

01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:37.320
This ain't it, chief.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.320
Friendly reminder

01:37:38.320 --> 01:37:40.320
that this isn't a good look.

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.320
Maybe don't be a cis bootlicker?

01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.320
Disappointing.

01:37:43.320 --> 01:37:44.320
But there's something

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.320
about them saying

01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.320
all those things already

01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.320
so I'm inoculated.

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.320
See, their mistake

01:37:48.320 --> 01:37:49.320
was completely breaking my spirit.

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:50.320
They should have left

01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320
a little piece intact.

01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.320
But it's good.

01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.320
It's good.

01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.320
It's good.

01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.320
Because, basically,

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.320
my survival from here on out

01:37:57.320 --> 01:37:59.320
hinges on my ability

01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:01.320
to not care at all

01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:03.320
what people say about me online.

01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:05.320
So...

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:09.320
here's to not giving a fuck.

01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:15.320
And to that,

01:38:15.320 --> 01:38:16.320
I hope,

01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:17.320
is to oxygenate

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:18.320
enough for the next

01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:19.320
time we meet.

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:20.320
Mew men.

01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:21.320
Sir,

01:38:21.320 --> 01:38:22.320
but well,

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:23.320
I've been working out all about

01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:24.320
this shit over the last 24 hours.

01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:25.320
You're more than welcome

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:26.320
to the VIP stages.

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:27.320
But, uh,

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:28.320
cleared enough?

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.320
If you like what you heard about

01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:30.320
it,

01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:32.320
give this studio a steaming

01:38:32.320 --> 01:38:33.320
shower.

01:38:33.320 --> 01:38:34.320
Powered by Ang-ile.

01:38:34.320 --> 01:38:35.320
Tremble is out ofachery!

01:38:35.320 --> 01:38:36.320
The walls of our conversation

01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:37.320
are close to this one.

01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.320
You guys know

01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.320
I believe this is gonna make

01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:40.320
you a pin jerk.

01:38:40.320 --> 01:38:41.320
Mhh!

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:42.240
We've got a deal,

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:43.240
baby.

01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.240
Ay,

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:44.280
push through!

01:38:44.320 --> 01:39:14.300
Thank you.

01:39:14.320 --> 01:39:44.300
Thank you.

01:39:44.320 --> 01:40:14.300
Thank you.

01:40:14.300 --> 01:40:20.260
