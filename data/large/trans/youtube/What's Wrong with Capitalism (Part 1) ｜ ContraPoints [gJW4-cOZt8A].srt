1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,600
When you look into the pools of the 9-11 memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,400
yourself questions.

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,360
Why is the world bad?

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,600
What did all these people die for?

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,660
Well, for freedom, I guess.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:19,640
And like, American values?

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,260
But what are those values?

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:24,920
What kind of freedom is it that we have?

9
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:29,960
The 9-11 memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.

10
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,600
There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want,

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,640
but they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,640
anyway.

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,640
Ugh.

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,960
Fuckin' neoliberalism?

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,080
What even goes on in these big buildings?

16
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,400
I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,120
Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather, drinking human blood, licking whipped

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:00:59,940
cream off the ends?

19
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:03,700
Are these the interns?

20
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,000
What the hell even is this country?

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,820
Just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place.

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:16,900
Longhorn Steakhouse, Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, PetSmart, Chipotle, Fridays,

23
00:01:16,900 --> 00:01:17,900
Dave & Buster's.

24
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:24,620
I guess it's not so bad, as long as you kick things up a notch.

25
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:29,620
Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order.

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,300
Dominoes?

27
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,380
Of course I want the fucking lava cakes.

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,380
I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza.

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:37,380
Put it all in me.

30
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,380
Fill me up.

31
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,380
Oh, goddammit.

32
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:46,380
It was so good, but I ate so much I think I'm gonna die.

33
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,380
Look what capitalism made me do.

34
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:57,380
...control of vast parts of territory all across the Middle East.

35
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,380
State foot number...

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:58,780
...state foot number...

37
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,300
State foot number...

38
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,540
State foot number...

39
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,520
State foot number...

40
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,920
...ами.

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,480
State foot number...

42
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,000
State foot number...

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,500
State foot number...

44
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,900
State foot number...

45
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,520
State foot number...

46
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,020
...amy.

47
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,380
...ami.

48
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:09,980
State foot number...

49
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:10,340
State foot number...

50
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,260
State foot number...

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:17,760
State foot number...

52
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,140
...amy.

53
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,260
State foot number...

54
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,180
State foot number...

55
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,980
State foot number...

56
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,180
State foot number...

57
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,040
State foot number...

58
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,340
State foot number...

59
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,880
slur against queer teenagers, but it comes from the movie Fight Club, where it refers

60
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,240
to a generation of white guys who have become adults only to find that they're worse off

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,280
than their fathers, that they don't have glamorous jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and, more

62
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,300
recently, that even in the escapist world of video games their absolute sovereignty

63
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,300
is being challenged.

64
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:54,140
I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.

65
00:02:54,140 --> 00:03:00,020
Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic

66
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,020
homeland.

67
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,780
But till now I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to

68
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,980
do that because, the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing

69
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:14,300
them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.

70
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,700
So the masculinist alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.

71
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:23,200
Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy

72
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,140
cucks.

73
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,420
Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid Ikea consumers.

74
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,420
Capitalism did.

75
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,740
So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people and

76
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,980
unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking goddamn

77
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:49,580
reptiles.

78
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,580
Chapter One.

79
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,580
Capitalism and Spirit.

80
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,920
Oh god, I sound like a philosopher.

81
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Someone shut up.

82
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,140
Don't shoot me.

83
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:59,840
Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,200
freedom is just another place to go shopping?

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,460
A leftist could easily have said that.

86
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,640
We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension

87
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,640
to it too.

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:14,380
Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human soul

89
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,140
under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer who appropriates

90
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,180
the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment of inanimate

91
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:23,980
objects with transcendence.

92
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:30,940
With the system of lies and delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself,

93
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:35,280
with fucking Comcast increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.

94
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
No, I don't want a landline.

95
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,980
No one under the age of 60 wants a landline.

96
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,880
Of course, it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise.

97
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,420
Fascists and conservatives notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective

98
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:50,980
meeting in ancient customs, racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.

99
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,980
And that shit's not really my scene.

100
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:58,040
I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person, but I think that capitalism

101
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:01,840
as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.

102
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
And here's why.

103
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Chapter 2.

104
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,240
Alienated labor.

105
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,480
Ugh, this Marxist jargon sucks.

106
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's come up with something new.

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,060
Chapter 2.

108
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Shitty jobs.

109
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,860
Why is your job so shitty?

110
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:17,260
Well, probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center, and

111
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,020
you spend your day dealing with whiny, entitled white bitches who don't understand that you're

112
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,980
just a lackey without any actual power.

113
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,860
And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout

114
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,860
at each other.

115
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,380
You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really

116
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,200
have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are

117
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,200
a gear.

118
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,320
The CEO makes $36 million a year, while you make $14 an hour, which means that a lot of

119
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,260
the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight up the

120
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,560
chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.

121
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,060
The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against

122
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,940
your fellow employees for a promotion, or even to not be laid off.

123
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,820
And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another

124
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,980
shitty job as a concrete lifter, or a mud mule, or maybe even a coffee shop MacBook

125
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,980
person.

126
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:10,580
This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your

127
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,340
shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.

128
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:20,560
And it gets even worse, you could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate

129
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,940
in team building exercises.

130
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:27,220
Companies scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not only do you have a shitty

131
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:31,720
oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure of openly hating your life.

132
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:35,600
You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining

133
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,980
the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.

134
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,780
These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.

135
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,740
If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.

136
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,860
They'll call you an independent contractor.

137
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,860
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:50,860
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,060
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,640
You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.

141
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,100
You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the

142
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,420
cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,

143
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:05,920
paid leave, or pension.

144
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,100
So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?

145
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,080
No, please don't transfer me to the billing department, they already transferred me here.

146
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,080
Chapter 3.

147
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,080
Advertising.

148
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,100
Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?

149
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,860
What if each section is named after an episode in the Odyssey?

150
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:24,780
If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from

151
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:31,300
all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals, and cigarettes, and sugar snacks,

152
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,480
and now you can't get no satisfaction.

153
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,320
Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like

154
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,420
a basic feature of the human condition.

155
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:43,500
But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to

156
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
life under capitalism.

157
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,940
I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered

158
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,060
up with advertisements for- oh.

159
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,260
Oh.

160
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,220
Oh.

161
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,220
So many fans.

162
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,620
Contrapoints is a tankie confirmed.

163
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,640
A neoliberal tankie.

164
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:02,400
The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend

165
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,120
nearly $500 billion a year doing.

166
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:09,260
The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the

167
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:14,240
fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,700
making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.

169
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,180
Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not-

170
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,440
very rational, for instance. Randomly correlating the product with sexual desire. Generating new

171
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,620
insecurities the product promises to alleviate. Associating the product with social status.

172
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:34,320
Associating the product with random famous people. Associating the product with degenerate decadence.

173
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,920
Associating the product with progressive social movements. Associating the product

174
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:42,660
with communist revolutions. Gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors.

175
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:48,640
Join the clone army. Completely original lighting. Gay orgies. Love cannot survive

176
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:53,980
without diamonds. Is this rational? Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best

177
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,860
interests? Of course not. The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that

178
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,000
people have. It's to endlessly create new needs. And that's a lot to keep up with and it takes a

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,240
lot of stamina. Which is why it's a good thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus. Every evening before

180
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,700
I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories for a sustainable

181
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,620
blast in power. With all natural ginseng and opium extracts,

182
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,760
Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria and indifference to paint that I need to get it in.

183
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,640
I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple ammels, then I take

184
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:38,600
my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open. Vitalimax. For bottoms.

185
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,880
Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires which they implant in your

186
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,260
brain through advertising. Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that

187
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,480
they invented.

188
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:58,020
So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human

189
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:03,140
happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to want and

190
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:07,440
then sell it to you. And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's

191
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
especially egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met. On the one hand,

192
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:17,040
we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt, spiraling tuition costs leading

193
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,460
college students to take out loans, and we have a society built not around meeting basic human needs,

194
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:18,980
but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to want and then sell it to you.

195
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:24,560
They may never escape, more than half a million homeless people, and 13 million children who have to go to school hungry.

196
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,940
And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass produce $400 juice packet

197
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:35,020
squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes, and there are apparently Americans who are

198
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,060
willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings. I mean it's a fine painting, it's

199
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:45,100
got a lot of great red on it, but is it really worth the cost of feeding every homeless person

200
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,880
in America for two weeks?

201
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,320
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

202
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,820
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

203
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,320
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

204
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,440
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

205
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,480
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

206
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,120
If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe, but shouldn't the economy serve

207
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,040
humanity rather than the other way around?

208
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,120
If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,

209
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,080
and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden donuts we can produce?

210
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:13,320
No cuts to Medicaid! Save our liberty!

211
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,080
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

212
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,720
Canto 4, message to the rich.

213
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,280
All right you

214
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,760
filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up.

215
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:25,080
I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics. I mean,

216
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,920
I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little significance

217
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,280
to that as you choose. But what I'm picking up at the moment is that people are getting

218
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:36,200
fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.

219
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,680
And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here. Recent polling data shows that a majority

220
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,040
of adults under the age of 30 do not support capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.

221
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,120
This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to be a rich person if you don't support capitalism.

222
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,560
You can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of the country is underemployed,

223
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,720
in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.

224
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:57,640
What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well. You can't just

225
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:02,280
stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this, when there are millions

226
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,520
of peasants who don't have enough to eat. They will eventually try to cut your heads off.

227
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,240
And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now,

228
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,240
if you don't fix some shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking

229
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,480
heads off. I mean, they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to

230
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:22,360
deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole thing,

231
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,440
bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.

232
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,680
Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.

233
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,080
The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going. Something is gonna have to change,

234
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,000
and we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. The choice is up to you.

235
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,120
Well?

236
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,400
Are you going?

237
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,760
To answer the phone?

238
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:54,760
There is no phone. There is only the sigh of the oppressed creature.

239
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,920
The heart of a heartless world. The soul of a soulless condition.

240
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,800
It's best to just try and ignore it.

241
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,040
Episode 5, Message to the Youth.

242
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,040
Alright kids, so you're angry. Well, good. The world sucks.

243
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,760
There's a lot to be angry about. What we have to do next,

244
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,240
is decide what to do with that anger. I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.

245
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,440
So, what do we do?

246
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,240
Smash?

247
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,080
Tabby, get in here. Sit down.

248
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you. Harsh words have been exchanged.

249
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,560
But I need young radicals like you in my life. The minute I stop listening to people like you,

250
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,800
is the minute I become irrelevant. So I apologize. I never meant to hurt you.

251
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,560
Baby, I'm sorry.

252
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,680
I mean look, I get it. Smashing is fun.

253
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,640
But we also need to have a real plan. That's all I'm saying.

254
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,000
So what's the plan?

255
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,840
Revolution.

256
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:59,160
Okay, yeah, revolution. I mean, you're right. Donald Trump is president. Fuck it. Revolution.

257
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:03,880
We've gotta get better people in office. We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?

258
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,080
No, revolution.

259
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,920
Yes, I know, revolution. But what kind of revolution? Like,

260
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,640
Project Mayhem? Gather your muskets, ye militiamen, and water the Tree of Liberty? What?

261
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,560
No, I mean direct action.

262
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,600
Okay, so like,

263
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,880
a general strike?

264
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,320
No, end capitalism.

265
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,000
Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here, because I really don't,

266
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,640
but I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more

267
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,000
substantive than just saying the word revolution. Like, I'm in support of radical movements.

268
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,440
Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings, I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot of energy,

269
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:46,600
they shift the Overton window to the left, and they can have a big cultural impact. But none of them

270
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:52,120
so far has ended capitalism. And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power, and we can change

271
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,520
the state through electoral politics, so why not direct some serious energy toward that?

272
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,920
Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China, but no elected politician has

273
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,960
ever even come close to ending capitalism in the US, so why do you think that will work?

274
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:09,560
What's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt,

275
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:13,560
finance-backed system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to?

276
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,440
Well, you're not entirely wrong. But on the other hand, Chinese,

277
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,840
and Soviet communism were not exactly super great, and in any case, I'm having a little bit

278
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:27,320
of trouble imagining a 1917-style revolutionary army marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.

279
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:31,880
Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion, and getting affordable healthcare and education,

280
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:37,320
and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals? What if the 2020 election is postponed?

281
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,640
Well, then I will transition into you and become you unironically. Why not just be honest about

282
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:45,720
your political stance? Are you a democratic socialist, or would you actually support a

283
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,280
revolution?

284
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,280
Well, I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.

285
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:54,200
Now, for you, Contrapoints, I mean, you're still a heretic and an enemy of the

286
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,120
Imperium and you are a demonette of Slanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.

287
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,000
Well, what exactly are your positions?

288
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,120
Um, well...

289
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:11,800
Kill everyone now! Condone first-degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit!

290
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,960
Filth are my politics? Eat reptiles?

291
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,920
Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?

292
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:23,720
Oh, because Marxist analysis is boring? And it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles?

293
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,640
But you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Aren't you discrediting yourself by using

294
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,160
David Icke's vocabulary?

295
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:33,240
Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books. Can the same be said of Horkheimer?

296
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,600
Have you read Horkheimer?

297
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,160
Yes.

298
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,520
Have you read Kropotkin?

299
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,080
Yes.

300
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,200
Have you read Bakunin?

301
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:39,800
No.

302
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,680
You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.

303
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,680
Have you read Plakhanov?

304
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,080
No.

305
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,440
Have you read Goldman?

306
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,120
Have you read Zetkin?

307
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:49,800
Have you read Gramsci?

308
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,960
Have you read Grindelwald?

309
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,120
Have you read Slobodan Zarathusian?

310
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,880
Have you read Sextus Arcanus?

311
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,240
Have you read Slot Skanarevsky?

312
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,800
TABBY!

313
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,880
I have half a PhD in reading tedious blowhards, and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading

314
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:02,920
any of that shit.

315
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,160
And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded Eastern Bloc gibberish is a prerequisite for

316
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:10,040
talking to you, then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.

317
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,280
I think I'm just gonna go.

318
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,400
This isn't really working out.

319
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:14,760
Wait.

320
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,260
TABBY.

321
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:18,840
Before you go, let me say one more thing.

322
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:32,680
If you ever change your mind about leaving, leaving me behind

323
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:39,800
Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin', bring it on home to me

324
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,440
Yeah, yeah

325
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:54,520
I know I laughed when you left, but now I only, I only hurt myself

326
00:17:54,520 --> 00:18:02,520
Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me

327
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Yeah, yeah

328
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:10,520
I'll bring you jewelry and money too

329
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:11,960
But that ain't all

330
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:24,520
Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me

331
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Yeah, yeah
