WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.

00:15.000 --> 00:24.000
My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything you hate.

00:24.000 --> 00:28.000
Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.

00:28.000 --> 00:37.000
Foreign invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands by a cabal of globalist elites.

00:37.000 --> 00:44.000
And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization as we know it.

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Now, watch as those same wives are violated,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
those same children violated,

00:58.000 --> 01:03.000
and dashed to pieces under the black boots of the Third World Horde.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Does that thought fill you with rage?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Good.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
We must be prepared to fight.

01:09.000 --> 01:11.000
To fight for our children,

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
and for our nation,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.000
and for our history,

01:14.000 --> 01:16.000
and for our culture.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
To fight for the homeland we've always known,

01:19.000 --> 01:22.000
and the people we've always loved.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.000
Make America great again.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Hail Victory!

01:28.000 --> 01:41.000
Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.

01:49.000 --> 01:53.000
So, actually, according to Hegel,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.000
the for itself can only be actualized through the in itself,

01:57.000 --> 02:01.000
so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
the transcendence of the dialectical object

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
through the sublimation of negative materiality.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.000
Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists!

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Death to capitalism!

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Hail Satan!

02:27.000 --> 02:42.000
So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Well, what do you expect?

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
We have the politicians against us,

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
a media run by giant corporations,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
and a complacent white middle class

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
that prefers order to justice.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
So, let's accept that all that's true.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
The game is rigged. Fine.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Now, how do you respond to that situation?

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
Do you change nothing about your strategy at all

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
and then blame the system when the predictable happens?

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
Or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
Look, I don't really need optics advice

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
from a bougie queer esthete

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
who puts style over substance

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
and thinks that shining a pink light on everything

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
can cover up her counter-revolutionary

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
Trotskyite tendencies.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I mean, are you even a communist?

03:21.000 --> 03:24.000
No! I'm not a communist.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Well, why not?

03:25.000 --> 03:28.000
Mmm! I like stuff.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
I like this, and I like this, and I like this.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
And that's why I can't be a communist.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
between private property and personal property, right?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
You're allowed to own possessions,

03:42.000 --> 03:44.000
you just can't exploit people by owning the means of production.

03:44.000 --> 03:47.000
Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.000
Well, you should feel bad about that.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Right.

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.000
That's what I thought.

04:02.000 --> 04:05.000
You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
And they're afraid of you.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
Well, fascists are afraid of me.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.000
Really?

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
Let's see.

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
We've got guillotines, Soviet memes,

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
liberals get the bullet too.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
you're some kind of scary terrorist.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.000
Okay, Jesus.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Let's hear your mind-blowing revelations

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
about respectability policy.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
Great.

04:27.000 --> 04:30.000
Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Positives first.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
The rose is great.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.000
Love the rose.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.000
Fantastic.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
Now, the hammer and sickle.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
We're gonna need to get rid of that.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
I'm just wearing it ironically.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
Now, don't you start with that.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
It makes me think of red lines and gulags,

04:44.000 --> 04:45.000
and it needs to go.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Well, maybe you're right.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Fine, I'll get rid of it.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
See, I can think about optics.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.000
What's that in your bag?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.000
Oh, this?

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
Yeah.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.000
We're gonna need to do something about that too.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Now, hold on.

04:55.000 --> 04:57.000
Getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.000
but Marx is a foundational thinker

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
in the history of progressive political...

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
I'm talking about giving him a makeover.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
It's making me depressed just looking at it.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Red and gold?

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
What is this foreign shit?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
Like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
It's un-American.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
I don't trust it.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
I don't like the cut of its jib.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.000
So you want a Marx Angles reader

05:20.000 --> 05:22.000
wrapped in an American flag.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Oh, I can do you better than that.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.000
Let's start with a gradient.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Add a grid.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Maybe a wave grid.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Let's get some shiny fonts.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
Maybe a bust.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
A pink bust with 3D glasses.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.000
Pink glasses.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.000
Maybe some palm trees.

05:37.000 --> 05:38.000
Oh, yeah.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Or how about this?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
Lots of brands.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.000
More, more, more.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Oh, my God.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
It's beautiful.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Okay, one more, one more.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.000
A pink field.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.000
Chiclet.

05:52.000 --> 05:53.000
Yeah.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
Yes, girl.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.000
Yes.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
I just realized that I actually hate you.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
Hello, fellow whites.

05:59.000 --> 06:02.000
Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and a

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
future for white children?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
Get the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
Effective, isn't it?

06:10.000 --> 06:12.000
Well, I see your point.

06:12.000 --> 06:17.000
But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,

06:17.000 --> 06:22.000
if there's some way you can not do that.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?

06:24.000 --> 06:29.000
I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
But that means getting 30,000 people on your side, which you're not gonna do by tweeting

06:40.000 --> 06:44.000
death threats and communist propaganda and using words like dialectic and telling everyone

06:44.000 --> 06:49.000
to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas

06:49.000 --> 06:54.000
and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with and expecting

06:54.000 --> 06:58.000
that people are gonna wanna leave their jobs and comfortable lives to join a violent revolution

06:58.000 --> 07:03.000
to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
Well, that's an unfair association.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.000
Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Has there ever been real communism?

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
Well, yes.

07:11.000 --> 07:17.000
Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary eastern Cameroon, a thriving, though short-lived,

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
communist utopia did flourish.

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
Until it was smashed by Western imperialism.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.000
Right.

07:23.000 --> 07:26.000
But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?

07:26.000 --> 07:29.000
You seem to not even care about what's actually possible.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.000
That's how deep you are in pure theory.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.

07:33.000 --> 07:37.000
You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.000
You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.000
Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs, you're never accountable for the

07:45.000 --> 07:46.000
way things are going.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.000
I'm not saying theory is everything.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.000
Only that there's no praxis.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
For all I know, you could be correct.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
I'm just saying it's a tough sell, and you are not selling it.

07:56.000 --> 08:00.000
Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal intellectual

08:00.000 --> 08:05.000
void where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing have shifted the Overton

08:05.000 --> 08:10.000
window one inch left of fascism under the heading of free speech and classical liberalism.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.000
Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.000
Hey, hey, hey.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.000
You leave centrists alone.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Thanks, Justine.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
Jackie, get out of here.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
I'll see you at brunch.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Mimosas.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
What the hell was that?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.000
Brunch?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You're gonna brunch with these people?

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Afternoon tea?

08:37.000 --> 08:42.000
Does Jeeves bring around madeleine cookies and fresh-sliced lemon wedges?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.000
No, but I do have a very nice Windsor China tea set.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.000
Unbelievable.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.000
You get the bullet, too.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You get the goddamn bullet, too.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh, come on.

08:51.000 --> 08:52.000
Me?

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
What do you want me to do?

08:53.000 --> 08:58.000
Drink victory gin out of a rusty herring tin like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries

08:58.000 --> 08:59.000
in eastern Cameroon?

08:59.000 --> 09:02.000
I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.

09:02.000 --> 09:06.000
I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle shooting at capitalists with

09:06.000 --> 09:10.000
a black beret and an eye patch, and I still wouldn't be left-wing enough for you.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists

09:14.000 --> 09:15.000
and not complaining about the optics?

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
I'm not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
you safe.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.000
How is Antifa keeping me safe?

09:21.000 --> 09:26.000
You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.

09:26.000 --> 09:32.000
Most of what we do is behind-the-scenes organizing, infiltrating fascist groups, doxing them, disrupting

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
their recruitment, and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist rallies.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.000
And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long

09:40.000 --> 09:44.000
enough, you're going to be at a counter-protest and the Black Bloc is going to save your life,

09:44.000 --> 09:48.000
because you don't look like you can fight, and the police certainly aren't going to save

09:48.000 --> 09:49.000
you.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.000
Well, maybe so.

09:50.000 --> 09:55.000
I mean, I'm the first to admit, these are not Nazi-punching hands, so I'm not going

09:55.000 --> 09:59.000
to get in your way, but in the free marketplace of ideas, and like it or not, that's what

09:59.000 --> 10:04.000
we're in, I can't help but think that what you are matters less than what you seem to

10:04.000 --> 10:09.000
be, and black-clad thugs and masks smashing things in the street seems pretty scary.

10:09.000 --> 10:13.000
Oh come on, you have to admit, there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
What about a girl in a mask?

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
Well, it was worth a shot.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.000
Look, my point is, you can't just win the war in the street.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.000
You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.000
You mean the propaganda war.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Shhh.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
Don't call it propaganda.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
There could be liberals listening.

10:39.000 --> 10:43.000
Look, what the left needs to get, and what the centrists need to get, and what only I

10:43.000 --> 10:47.000
and fascists seem to understand, is that reason doesn't matter very much.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
Oh boy.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.000
Here we go.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
What is it the centrists hate about social justice warriors?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.000
It's not that they don't have good reasons in support of their arguments, it's that they're

10:54.000 --> 10:56.000
not cool, right?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
Social justice warriors are not cool.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.000
What do you mean?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.000
They're not popular?

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
No, no, no, I mean they're not cool.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
You can be unpopular and still cool.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
In fact, it can be cool to be unpopular.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
So what does it mean to be cool?

11:07.000 --> 11:11.000
Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself, and the leading complaint about

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
social justice warriors is that they're not cool.

11:12.000 --> 11:18.000
The social justice warriors who everyone cringes at online are people who I'm sure are nice

11:18.000 --> 11:22.000
people, but who are having a bad moment, and they're caught on camera in the middle of

11:22.000 --> 11:23.000
an outburst.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.000
They're out of control.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
And that's the problem.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
It's not cool.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Luck.

11:27.000 --> 11:32.000
This detached, ironic, pretend-not-to-give-a-shit posturing that white men mistake for rationality

11:32.000 --> 11:37.000
is really just the self-celebration of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.

11:37.000 --> 11:41.000
People on the left are never going to be cool because anger and emotion are rational responses

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
to injustice.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.000
I thought you'd say that.

11:43.000 --> 11:48.000
But what you're failing to consider is that it's possible to be both angry and cool.

11:48.000 --> 11:52.000
And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger into a glass of cool?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
What?

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
You get ice cold.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.000
I'm sorry, what?

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
And that's what we on the left need to become.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
Ice cold motherfuckers.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
What the hell are you talking about?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.000
Miles Davis.

12:10.000 --> 12:12.000
Incredibly cool.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
But pretty angry.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Did not take shit from white people.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
But also, ice cold motherfucker.

12:18.000 --> 12:22.000
So your plan is to win over centrists by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.000
Precisely.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.000
What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
This is ridiculous.

12:27.000 --> 12:31.000
And I suppose you think this is ridiculous.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
I think it's stalemate.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.000
No it's not.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
My queen is wide open.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
No it isn't.

12:38.000 --> 12:39.000
Take me.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
I'm gonna get going now.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.000
Wait, where are you going?

12:42.000 --> 12:44.000
I'm gonna go bash the fash.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
Well, be careful.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.000
Sure.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
Enjoy your tea tomorrow.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.000
What a goddamn lunatic.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
I'm gonna miss her.

13:09.000 --> 13:27.000
You gotta move him off the ice.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
I'm going.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.000
Good luck.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
See ya.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.000
Go.

13:32.000 --> 13:33.000
Yeah.

13:33.000 --> 13:34.000
See ya.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.000
See ya.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
You.

13:36.000 --> 13:37.000
Yeah.

13:37.000 --> 13:50.420
Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?

13:50.560 --> 13:52.300
They got into a fight on Skype, remember?

13:52.780 --> 13:53.940
Anyway, they killed each other.

13:54.020 --> 13:54.760
They're both dead.

13:55.080 --> 13:57.420
They kind of fired guns off in random directions.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.900
It's best not to think about it too much.
