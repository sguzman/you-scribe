Hello again, the gays.

00:04.880 --> 00:06.960
Welcome to my garden party fantasy.

00:06.960 --> 00:11.240
Straight people, you're of course welcome to tag along too, provided you're emotionally

00:11.240 --> 00:12.240
damaged!

00:12.240 --> 00:13.240
Hi!

00:13.240 --> 00:14.240
Hey, how are you?

00:14.240 --> 00:15.240
Cringe!

00:15.240 --> 00:16.560
Let's talk about it!

00:16.560 --> 00:21.200
The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately, it just pops into my head all the

00:21.200 --> 00:22.200
time.

00:22.200 --> 00:26.400
Like, when I randomly remember that month back in 2013, when all of my Facebook posts

00:26.400 --> 00:31.280
were just lyrics to Kesha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter, why?

00:31.280 --> 00:32.940
What audience was that for?

00:32.940 --> 00:35.900
Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?

00:35.900 --> 00:36.900
Cringe!

00:36.900 --> 00:37.900
Mega cringe!

00:37.900 --> 00:41.740
I think I say this word like 50 times a day, cringe, cringe, cringe.

00:41.740 --> 00:42.740
And I'm not the only one.

00:42.740 --> 00:46.520
Google Trends shows that in the US, search interest in the word cringe has dramatically

00:46.520 --> 00:51.260
increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since.

00:51.260 --> 00:55.280
And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe has hit an all-time high

00:55.280 --> 00:56.360
the month I'm making this video.

00:56.360 --> 00:59.120
So what is cringe?

00:59.120 --> 01:01.600
Well, let's start with some examples.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.100
There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled, What Things Really Make You Cringe?

01:06.100 --> 01:08.240
And here are some of the most upvoted responses.

01:08.240 --> 01:11.720
The time I was talking too loud at a wedding when I wasn't supposed to, and everyone

01:11.720 --> 01:14.800
at the wedding turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

01:14.800 --> 01:16.320
Recordings of my own voice.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.440
When I remember that I did the, I do have a boyfriend, he just goes to another school

01:20.440 --> 01:21.440
thing.

01:21.440 --> 01:22.580
Early teen me.

01:22.580 --> 01:23.960
So many cringe stuff I did.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.240
I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.

01:26.240 --> 01:27.740
This happened about two years ago.

01:27.740 --> 01:32.060
I ordered some Pizza Hut online, and when it was delivered, the lady handed me the pizza

01:32.060 --> 01:33.060
boxes.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.900
I said thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.

01:35.900 --> 01:36.900
I said, oh.

01:36.900 --> 01:40.820
And then she hands me the receipt to sign and leave a tip, and I spend 30 seconds trying

01:40.820 --> 01:42.160
to get the pen to work.

01:42.160 --> 01:45.240
She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.

01:45.240 --> 01:46.240
I said, oh.

01:46.240 --> 01:49.560
And then she reaches to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good.

01:49.560 --> 01:51.360
Then I said, you too.

01:51.360 --> 01:53.120
And then I closed the door and killed myself.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.280
All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl said.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.280
She said, oh.

01:55.280 --> 01:56.320
Yeah, this is what I'm seeing.

01:56.320 --> 01:57.320
But even though I had a better opinion on myself, I'm still disappointed in myself.

01:57.320 --> 01:58.320
I'm not gonna be that person.

01:58.320 --> 01:59.320
I'm not really that person.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.320
So if she's gonna know who I am, I'm going to have to have to go live.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.320
I don't want to.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.320
She wrote from her book, Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.240
According to Dahl,

02:03.240 --> 02:04.780
The moments that make us cringe are when we're yanked out of our own perspective, and we

02:04.780 --> 02:07.880
can suddenly see ourselves from somebody else's point of view.

02:07.880 --> 02:12.940
She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who in the 60s did a study of the Biyami tribe

02:12.940 --> 02:16.980
in New Guinea, where he showed them mirror, video and photographic images of themselves

02:16.980 --> 02:19.520
for the first time and described the results.

02:19.520 --> 02:24.100
They were paralyzed after their first startled response, covering their mouths and ducking

02:24.100 --> 02:28.740
heads. They stood transfixed, staring at their images, only their stomach muscles betraying

02:28.740 --> 02:29.740
great tension."

02:29.740 --> 02:34.780
So basically, they cringed at themselves. Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.

02:34.780 --> 02:38.300
Like pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice when they hear a recording

02:38.300 --> 02:41.860
for the first time. I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating

02:41.860 --> 02:46.380
in your head. So when you hear the recording, you realize, oh god, that's how other people

02:46.380 --> 02:50.660
hear me all the time. And you're suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear

02:50.660 --> 02:55.020
to yourself, and the way you appear to other people. That's when you cringe, the feeling

02:55.020 --> 03:00.580
Dahl describes as the intense visceral reaction produced by an awkward moment, an unpleasant

03:00.580 --> 03:05.460
kind of self-recognition where you suddenly see yourself through someone else's eyes.

03:05.460 --> 03:10.160
It's a forced moment of self-awareness, and it usually makes you cognizant of the disappointing

03:10.160 --> 03:13.700
fact that you aren't measuring up to your own self-concept.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.980
When you're talking too loud at a wedding, and suddenly everyone turns around to see

03:16.980 --> 03:20.620
what asshole wouldn't shut up, you suddenly realize how you look to them.

03:20.620 --> 03:25.140
Because we've all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.

03:25.140 --> 03:28.620
But this time, you're the asshole. Cringe.

03:28.620 --> 03:33.400
Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe. There's no law

03:33.400 --> 03:38.120
of state, or even of etiquette, that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed to speak

03:38.120 --> 03:42.680
at a wedding. It's something you have to intuit based on context. How loud are other people

03:42.680 --> 03:47.100
speaking? Is the ceremony about to begin and we're all supposed to be quiet now?

03:47.100 --> 03:50.560
According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael here, the function of awkwardness

03:50.560 --> 03:56.980
is that it sands social dynamics by smoothing out what even etiquette doesn't rule on.

03:56.980 --> 04:02.500
Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment, for being awkward. It enforces

04:02.500 --> 04:06.860
the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego.

04:06.860 --> 04:11.360
And memories of your cringey moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves.

04:11.360 --> 04:15.180
Ten years later, you'll be trying to fall asleep, and for no reason at all, your brain

04:15.180 --> 04:19.180
will decide to remind you of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding, and

04:19.180 --> 04:20.540
of the stupid thing you were doing.

04:20.540 --> 04:24.200
You were saying when everyone turned around to stare at you, and you'll cringe all over

04:24.200 --> 04:28.220
again. That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful. Because you look back

04:28.220 --> 04:34.880
and you realize, damn, I was the asshole for like, seven consecutive years. Can I just

04:34.880 --> 04:40.080
hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don't know, November?

04:40.080 --> 04:44.420
Now all the examples we've considered so far involve self-cringe, but usually when

04:44.420 --> 04:49.100
we talk about cringe on the internet, we're talking about cringing at other people. Popular

04:49.100 --> 04:50.100
subreddits like r slash cringe are often just a way to show that you're not cringing at

04:50.100 --> 04:50.300
other people.

04:50.540 --> 04:56.280
Cringe, cringepix, and cringetopia host videos and images of people behaving in cringey ways.

04:56.280 --> 05:00.740
For instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis, grim moments of lamentation

05:00.740 --> 05:04.720
and cuckoldry, and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter

05:04.720 --> 05:05.740
with black people.

05:05.740 --> 05:08.820
Who let the dogs out? Who? Who?

05:08.820 --> 05:13.920
Ugh. Watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire. It makes me want to crawl out

05:13.920 --> 05:19.040
of my body and escape into another dimension. I think some people feel cringe more intensely

05:19.040 --> 05:20.040
than others.

05:20.040 --> 05:24.420
For me, it's uncomfortable to the point where I will reflexively pause a video like

05:24.420 --> 05:28.260
that because I just can't stand it. In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube

05:28.260 --> 05:32.340
videos, whichâ€¦ Sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room.

05:32.340 --> 05:37.120
So why is it that cringing at other people hurts in the same way as cringing at yourself?

05:37.120 --> 05:41.960
Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment,

05:41.960 --> 05:45.860
or secondhand embarrassment. Basically, it's a form of empathy.

05:45.860 --> 05:49.380
When you cringe at someone, you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,

05:49.380 --> 05:52.420
just as if if you watch someone fall down the stairs,

05:52.420 --> 05:55.140
you might wince empathetically with their pain.

05:55.140 --> 05:55.960
But there's a problem

05:55.960 --> 05:58.380
with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,

05:58.380 --> 05:59.840
or at least a complication,

05:59.840 --> 06:02.260
which is that in the purest examples of cringe,

06:02.260 --> 06:06.120
the person doing the cringey thing isn't feeling embarrassed.

06:06.120 --> 06:08.220
In fact, often they're super confident,

06:08.220 --> 06:10.520
and it's actually their lack of self-awareness

06:10.520 --> 06:13.600
about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.

06:13.600 --> 06:14.620
Like when a woman posts

06:14.620 --> 06:17.300
a ridiculously over-face-tuned picture of herself

06:17.300 --> 06:19.780
as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,

06:19.780 --> 06:22.500
or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy

06:22.500 --> 06:25.360
when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.

06:25.360 --> 06:27.060
So in the internet sense of the word,

06:27.060 --> 06:30.020
cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.860
Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,

06:32.860 --> 06:34.900
and I do feel embarrassed for her,

06:34.900 --> 06:38.320
but she knows it's embarrassing and she feels embarrassed.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.480
You guys are just standing up

06:39.480 --> 06:40.880
because you feel bad that I fell,

06:40.880 --> 06:42.920
and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.020
Nothing about this is cringe.

06:45.020 --> 06:47.140
Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.780
Maybe she looks back on it and it's still embarrassing,

06:49.780 --> 06:52.040
but I don't cringe at her.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.940
Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone

06:54.940 --> 06:56.420
and cringing with them.

06:56.420 --> 06:59.460
When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her

06:59.460 --> 07:02.100
in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.

07:02.100 --> 07:04.520
My feelings mirror what she's feeling.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.800
But when I'm cringing at someone,

07:06.800 --> 07:08.380
I'm feeling something very different

07:08.380 --> 07:09.320
to what they're feeling.

07:09.320 --> 07:12.080
I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here

07:12.080 --> 07:16.020
because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.

07:16.020 --> 07:16.980
Another example is

07:16.980 --> 07:18.900
bad American Idol auditions,

07:18.900 --> 07:21.140
which are quintessential cringe content.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.380
People try out for American Idol

07:23.380 --> 07:25.640
because they think they're good enough singers

07:25.640 --> 07:27.660
to compete in a national competition.

07:27.660 --> 07:30.240
So they're effectively revealing their own delusions

07:30.240 --> 07:32.360
when they show up and sing like this.

07:32.360 --> 07:35.600
Is this the real life?

07:35.600 --> 07:38.880
Or is this just fantasy?

07:38.880 --> 07:41.660
It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.

07:41.660 --> 07:43.540
Most of us are bad singers, right?

07:43.540 --> 07:45.720
When people sing happy birthday at a party,

07:45.720 --> 07:46.560
usually they're singing

07:46.980 --> 07:48.940
different keys at no particular tempo.

07:48.940 --> 07:50.000
But that's not cringe,

07:50.000 --> 07:52.100
because the point of singing happy birthday

07:52.100 --> 07:53.480
is not to sound amazing.

07:53.480 --> 07:55.660
Bad American Idol auditions are cringe

07:55.660 --> 07:58.820
because of the contestant's misplaced confidence.

07:58.820 --> 08:01.700
Who are you as good as, in your opinion?

08:01.700 --> 08:03.580
The lead singer from Queen.

08:03.580 --> 08:07.320
It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury

08:07.320 --> 08:10.020
when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog.

08:10.020 --> 08:15.400
I admit that watching Red,

08:15.400 --> 08:16.860
I'm actually not in very much pain

08:16.860 --> 08:17.960
when I'm cringing at him.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.140
I laugh at his ludicrous performance,

08:20.140 --> 08:21.480
just like the judges do.

08:21.480 --> 08:23.500
And because he's so cocky,

08:23.500 --> 08:26.680
and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,

08:26.680 --> 08:30.220
there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure.

08:30.220 --> 08:32.040
There's almost a sense of karma,

08:32.040 --> 08:34.260
a sense that because of his tragic hubris,

08:34.260 --> 08:37.820
he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.600
And my sense that he deserves it

08:39.600 --> 08:42.140
suppresses my compassionate response

08:42.140 --> 08:45.060
and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have

08:45.060 --> 08:46.820
about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.

08:46.860 --> 08:50.540
Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant,

08:50.540 --> 08:52.460
Misha, who's there with her mom,

08:52.460 --> 08:54.960
and they both seem like such sweethearts.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.700
I do believe in her talent.

08:56.700 --> 08:57.960
That's very much.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.640
And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,

09:00.640 --> 09:02.460
but I'm rooting for her.

09:02.460 --> 09:06.240
And when she embarrasses herself, I feel no joy,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.880
only deep and agonizing cringe.

09:08.880 --> 09:13.700
Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?

09:13.700 --> 09:14.540
Yikes.

09:14.540 --> 09:15.960
My differing reactions to Red and Misha,

09:15.960 --> 09:19.240
track a distinction that Dahl makes

09:19.240 --> 09:22.760
between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.

09:22.760 --> 09:26.320
Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification

09:26.320 --> 09:28.100
with the person you're cringing at.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.020
Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves

09:30.020 --> 09:31.540
in the cringe-worthy moment,

09:31.540 --> 09:34.380
you still feel the embarrassment they would feel

09:34.380 --> 09:37.320
or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware

09:37.320 --> 09:39.380
of how other people were perceiving them.

09:39.380 --> 09:41.560
Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,

09:41.560 --> 09:43.840
involves an emotional distancing

09:43.840 --> 09:45.460
from the person you're cringing at.

09:45.460 --> 09:47.260
Just like with compassionate cringe,

09:47.260 --> 09:50.360
you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,

09:50.360 --> 09:53.240
but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,

09:53.240 --> 09:56.360
you feel annoyance and disgust at them,

09:56.360 --> 09:58.360
and maybe even a little schadenfreude.

09:58.360 --> 10:01.840
So these are actually two very different emotional responses,

10:01.840 --> 10:04.400
vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.260
We call both feelings cringe,

10:06.260 --> 10:08.200
not because they're similar feelings,

10:08.200 --> 10:11.760
but because they're responses to the same type of situation.

10:11.760 --> 10:13.360
People lacking self-awareness

10:13.360 --> 10:15.460
embarrassing themselves without realizing it.

10:15.460 --> 10:18.860
Now, embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,

10:18.860 --> 10:20.960
like pretty unpleasant feelings.

10:20.960 --> 10:23.360
So why are we so fascinated by content

10:23.360 --> 10:24.860
that makes us feel this way?

10:24.860 --> 10:28.360
Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members?

10:28.360 --> 10:31.260
Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos

10:31.260 --> 10:33.060
so popular on YouTube?

10:33.060 --> 10:36.260
Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?

10:36.260 --> 10:38.560
Well, I think the answer to that question depends

10:38.560 --> 10:41.760
on whether we're cringing compassionately or contemptuously.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.460
When I read that Ask Reddit thread

10:43.460 --> 10:45.360
where all the people share their cringe stories,

10:45.460 --> 10:47.160
I cringe compassionately.

10:47.160 --> 10:50.360
That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.

10:50.360 --> 10:53.460
And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity

10:53.460 --> 10:55.060
and camaraderie with them.

10:55.060 --> 10:56.860
I recognize myself in them,

10:56.860 --> 10:59.460
and I'm reassured to hear that other people

10:59.460 --> 11:02.060
are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.

11:02.060 --> 11:04.460
I'm not the only one who cringes at my past

11:04.460 --> 11:05.960
or at videos of myself.

11:05.960 --> 11:07.660
I'm not the only one who sometimes says,

11:07.660 --> 11:10.460
you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.

11:10.460 --> 11:12.860
When we collectively laugh at these situations,

11:12.860 --> 11:15.360
we're bonding over our shared human frailty.

11:15.460 --> 11:18.560
We're recognizing that we all say the wrong things sometimes.

11:18.560 --> 11:21.560
That we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion,

11:21.560 --> 11:23.360
only to later educate ourselves

11:23.360 --> 11:26.560
and realize how ignorant and wrong we were.

11:26.560 --> 11:29.760
That we've all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable,

11:29.760 --> 11:32.960
as beautiful and talented and badass,

11:32.960 --> 11:34.360
only to totally miss the mark

11:34.360 --> 11:36.160
and completely embarrass ourselves.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.560
And laughing at our shared absurdity,

11:38.560 --> 11:41.860
our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses,

11:41.860 --> 11:43.560
it makes us feel less alone.

11:43.560 --> 11:45.260
Now, this is all, of course, assuming

11:45.260 --> 11:47.260
that we're cringing compassionately.

11:47.260 --> 11:51.660
But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet

11:51.660 --> 11:53.560
does not encourage compassion.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.560
And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact,

11:55.560 --> 11:59.260
because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.260
This is the 21st century, right?

12:01.260 --> 12:04.760
Pilleries and freak shows and public floggings,

12:04.760 --> 12:08.060
these are barbaric practices from the dark ages, right?

12:08.060 --> 12:11.160
Surely no one on the internet would ever entertain themselves

12:11.160 --> 12:14.160
by humiliating people, right?

12:15.260 --> 12:18.260
We've got maniacs.

12:18.260 --> 12:19.760
We've got wackadoos.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.760
We've got schizos, fatties, and spergs.

12:22.760 --> 12:26.260
Come see sexual deviants on display.

12:26.260 --> 12:27.260
That's right, folks.

12:27.260 --> 12:30.760
We've got cackling perverts of every denomination.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.260
Come see the panty sniffer.

12:32.260 --> 12:35.760
He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.260
Come see the skeleton girl.

12:37.260 --> 12:39.260
She hasn't had a bite in 30 days.

12:39.260 --> 12:43.260
That's right, we've got real, live lesbians.

12:43.260 --> 12:45.260
And I'll be your master of ceremonies.

12:45.260 --> 12:49.260
Half man, half woman, all freak.

12:50.260 --> 12:53.760
Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.

12:53.760 --> 12:55.760
Welcome to the dark side of cringe.

12:55.760 --> 12:59.260
Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture.

12:59.260 --> 13:02.260
And by that I mean there's whole channels making content

13:02.260 --> 13:04.760
that centers the experience of cringing.

13:04.760 --> 13:07.760
And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content,

13:07.760 --> 13:11.760
including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.

13:11.760 --> 13:14.760
I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,

13:14.760 --> 13:17.760
which was the heyday of the feminist cringe compilation,

13:17.760 --> 13:20.260
or SJW cringe compilation.

13:20.260 --> 13:21.260
Remember those?

13:21.260 --> 13:23.760
This is ancient history by YouTube standards,

13:23.760 --> 13:26.760
but in 2016, the word cringe was most associated

13:26.760 --> 13:29.260
with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.

13:29.260 --> 13:32.260
His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video,

13:32.260 --> 13:34.760
which means he would play someone else's content,

13:34.760 --> 13:38.760
then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is.

13:38.760 --> 13:40.260
No makeup or some sweatpants.

13:40.260 --> 13:41.760
Oh my god.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.760
It's so fucking bad.

13:43.760 --> 13:45.260
He looks like he's gender fluid.

13:45.260 --> 13:47.260
He looks like a fucking lesbian.

13:47.260 --> 13:51.260
This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,

13:51.260 --> 13:55.260
and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts

13:55.260 --> 13:56.760
and free-thinking tuxedos.

13:56.760 --> 13:58.260
What even is this thing?

13:58.260 --> 14:00.260
It must be one of the 76 genders.

14:00.260 --> 14:03.260
I didn't realize retarded was a gender.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.260
Sorry, my dudes.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.260
You were on the cringe side of history.

14:06.260 --> 14:09.760
Obviously, there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.

14:09.760 --> 14:12.760
The logical antelope isn't inviting you to foster

14:12.760 --> 14:16.260
a shared sense of humanity by recognizing your own weakness

14:16.260 --> 14:18.260
in the embarrassment of screeching feminists.

14:18.260 --> 14:21.260
No, this is an invitation to contempt.

14:21.260 --> 14:25.260
Here's a YouTube video titled Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.260
You'd expect from the title that it would be a video

14:27.260 --> 14:30.760
of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways.

14:30.760 --> 14:31.760
But it isn't.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.760
It's literally just a compilation of fat people doing things.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.260
This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.

14:37.260 --> 14:38.760
Is this cringe?

14:38.760 --> 14:40.260
What is cringe about it?

14:40.260 --> 14:42.260
Earlier we defined cringe as either

14:42.260 --> 14:44.760
vicarious embarrassment or contempt

14:44.760 --> 14:47.760
for someone who lacks awareness about the way others are perceiving them.

14:47.760 --> 14:51.260
But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there's no context,

14:51.260 --> 14:53.760
so we don't know anything about her mental state.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.760
And we certainly don't know whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.

14:57.760 --> 15:00.760
If there is an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel

15:00.760 --> 15:04.260
or if she tried to photoshop herself to look like a size 4,

15:04.260 --> 15:06.260
okay, maybe that would be cringe.

15:06.260 --> 15:08.260
But that's not what's going on in this clip.

15:08.260 --> 15:10.260
She's just existing.

15:10.260 --> 15:11.260
In water.

15:11.260 --> 15:14.260
What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?

15:14.260 --> 15:16.760
Presumably, something along the lines of

15:16.760 --> 15:17.760
ew.

15:17.760 --> 15:18.760
Fat people.

15:18.760 --> 15:19.760
Gross.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.760
It's literally just disgust, right?

15:21.760 --> 15:25.760
Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.260
Here's another cringe compilation,

15:27.260 --> 15:28.260
this one titled

15:30.260 --> 15:35.760
and we're watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their genderfluid identity.

15:35.760 --> 15:39.260
Honestly, it's kind of terrifying because,

15:39.260 --> 15:40.760
you know, like,

15:41.260 --> 15:43.760
genderfluid people just aren't accepted.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.260
Yeah, apparently not.

15:45.260 --> 15:49.260
And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this in a cringe compilation,

15:49.260 --> 15:53.760
it seems that the person in this video was dead on about how people would perceive them.

15:53.760 --> 15:55.760
But despite that self-awareness,

15:55.760 --> 15:57.760
we're being invited to cringe.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.260
Because...

15:59.260 --> 16:02.260
I guess being genderfluid, like being fat,

16:02.260 --> 16:04.760
is cringe in and of itself.

16:04.760 --> 16:08.260
Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.

16:08.260 --> 16:10.760
This is not real cringe, I wanna say.

16:10.760 --> 16:15.260
Cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others.

16:15.260 --> 16:20.260
But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread

16:20.260 --> 16:22.760
that there's really no point in objecting to it.

16:22.760 --> 16:25.260
If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia,

16:25.260 --> 16:27.260
one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,

16:27.260 --> 16:30.260
you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow,

16:30.260 --> 16:31.260
a furry,

16:31.260 --> 16:32.760
a couple bronies,

16:32.760 --> 16:34.260
a fedora tipper.

16:34.260 --> 16:38.760
These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.760
They're types of people who are white,

16:40.760 --> 16:42.260
widely ridiculed online.

16:42.260 --> 16:45.260
I'd like to share with you a list that I put together

16:45.260 --> 16:48.260
of groups that are often considered to be cringe.

16:48.260 --> 16:48.760
Bronies,

16:48.760 --> 16:49.760
furries,

16:49.760 --> 16:50.260
otaku,

16:50.260 --> 16:51.260
weebs,

16:51.260 --> 16:51.760
incels,

16:51.760 --> 16:52.760
neckbeards,

16:52.760 --> 16:53.760
fedora tippers,

16:53.760 --> 16:54.760
gamers,

16:54.760 --> 16:55.760
TikTok teens,

16:55.760 --> 16:57.260
not-like-other-girls girls,

16:57.260 --> 16:58.260
fanfic writers,

16:58.260 --> 16:59.260
beat poets,

16:59.260 --> 17:00.260
SJWs,

17:00.260 --> 17:00.760
feminists,

17:00.760 --> 17:01.760
magas,

17:01.760 --> 17:02.760
trans people,

17:02.760 --> 17:03.760
non-binary people,

17:03.760 --> 17:04.760
trans trenders,

17:04.760 --> 17:06.760
queer afab ukulele players,

17:06.760 --> 17:07.760
autistic people,

17:07.760 --> 17:08.760
fat people,

17:08.760 --> 17:09.760
the mentally ill,

17:09.760 --> 17:10.760
and the mentally disabled.

17:10.760 --> 17:14.260
Now I'm searching for some thread that all these groups have in common,

17:14.260 --> 17:16.760
and a handful of themes do jump out.

17:16.760 --> 17:17.760
Deviancy,

17:17.760 --> 17:20.260
whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.

17:20.260 --> 17:23.760
A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.

17:23.760 --> 17:26.760
The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.

17:26.760 --> 17:29.760
Obsessive interests and unconventional hobbies.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.260
Low social status.

17:31.260 --> 17:34.260
It's pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.260
If you add up all the groups on this list,

17:36.260 --> 17:39.260
I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.

17:39.260 --> 17:40.760
It includes me three or four times.

17:40.760 --> 17:45.760
I'm of course a fedora-tipping, queer, afab, ukulele-playing TikTok team.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.760
Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe,

17:47.760 --> 17:51.760
and try to be, like, compassionate or whatever?

17:51.760 --> 17:53.260
Fuck no.

17:53.260 --> 17:56.760
The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.

17:56.760 --> 17:57.260
Oh no.

17:57.260 --> 18:00.260
This is social reject battle royale.

18:00.260 --> 18:04.260
Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way,

18:04.260 --> 18:07.760
and I want to explore what the rewards might be.

18:07.760 --> 18:10.760
Let's start by looking at the role of cringe in internet politics.

18:10.760 --> 18:14.760
Where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.760
At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,

18:17.760 --> 18:21.760
you couldn't escape clips of this woman, known as Big Red,

18:21.760 --> 18:24.760
a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event

18:24.760 --> 18:28.260
and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely.

18:28.260 --> 18:30.260
It's part of patriarchy.

18:30.260 --> 18:31.760
Part of patriarchy.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.260
I don't know if you're noticing a theme.

18:33.260 --> 18:34.260
Patriarchy.

18:34.260 --> 18:35.260
I'm reading.

18:35.260 --> 18:36.260
Fuckface.

18:36.260 --> 18:37.260
Mr. Entitled.

18:37.260 --> 18:38.260
Mr. Ego.

18:38.260 --> 18:39.260
Patriarchy, fuckface.

18:39.260 --> 18:40.760
She's one of these people who just

18:40.760 --> 18:42.760
generates memeable phrases at an amazing rate.

18:42.760 --> 18:44.760
I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,

18:44.760 --> 18:47.760
but I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.760
Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,

18:50.760 --> 18:54.760
reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.760
Often Big Red was framed as, like,

18:56.760 --> 18:59.760
THE feminist, the mascot of feminism,

18:59.760 --> 19:02.760
a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists.

19:02.760 --> 19:07.760
Which is highly dishonest, considering she's not even a high-profile activist or thinker.

19:07.760 --> 19:10.760
She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.760
But because of this amusing 12-minute video,

19:12.760 --> 19:16.760
it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman,

19:16.760 --> 19:21.760
who, we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.760
I call this strategy mascotization,

19:24.760 --> 19:26.760
the construction of a strawman nemesis.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.760
What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person

19:29.760 --> 19:33.760
and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.760
It's very simple, but very effective.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.760
And it's best paired with memification.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.760
That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,

19:40.760 --> 19:41.760
you freeze it,

19:41.760 --> 19:45.760
and you declare that that moment fully represents a person.

19:45.760 --> 19:47.760
Then, through mascotization,

19:47.760 --> 19:52.760
you declare that this memified person represents an entire group or movement.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.760
Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester,

19:55.760 --> 19:57.760
You're fucking a white male!

19:57.760 --> 19:59.760
memified as AIDS Skrillex,

19:59.760 --> 20:00.760
and this protester,

20:00.760 --> 20:05.760
Keep your hands clean! I'm a scoundrel! Keep your hands clean! I'm a scoundrel!

20:05.760 --> 20:07.760
who was memified as Trigley Puff.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.760
The two of them symbolized the wretchedness

20:09.760 --> 20:11.760
of beta new male cuckoldry

20:11.760 --> 20:15.760
and the hysteria of social justice cry bullies, respectively.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.760
I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,

20:18.760 --> 20:22.760
about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.760
Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,

20:25.760 --> 20:27.760
as like this fake gamer girl,

20:27.760 --> 20:29.760
this pleb-tier casual,

20:29.760 --> 20:31.760
throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.760
But other times it was almost a super villainous caricature,

20:34.760 --> 20:38.760
this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype,

20:38.760 --> 20:40.760
threatening to confiscate your video games

20:40.760 --> 20:42.760
and engulf you in her yonic abyss.

20:42.760 --> 20:47.760
Now it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as super villainous is effective.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.760
Though it comes at the risk of backfiring

20:49.760 --> 20:52.760
by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,

20:52.760 --> 20:54.760
a little too badass.

20:54.760 --> 20:58.760
But the subtler strategy of symbolizing your political enemies

20:58.760 --> 21:01.760
not with an evil, but with a cringe-worthy mascot,

21:01.760 --> 21:06.760
works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense, emotional way.

21:06.760 --> 21:11.760
Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule.

21:11.760 --> 21:13.760
And if someone has been made a laughingstock,

21:13.760 --> 21:17.760
it's much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing

21:17.760 --> 21:20.760
than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.

21:20.760 --> 21:23.760
To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.

21:23.760 --> 21:26.760
And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,

21:26.760 --> 21:30.760
I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content

21:30.760 --> 21:35.760
is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.760
When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,

21:38.760 --> 21:40.760
laughing at someone and ridiculing them,

21:40.760 --> 21:44.760
we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.

21:44.760 --> 21:47.760
Don't act like that, or people will laugh at you.

21:47.760 --> 21:51.760
This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior.

21:51.760 --> 21:56.760
It's why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals.

21:56.760 --> 22:00.760
You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory, at the whipping post.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.760
You see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables.

22:03.760 --> 22:05.760
And it sends a powerful message.

22:05.760 --> 22:07.760
Don't do whatever that guy did.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.760
I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact

22:10.760 --> 22:15.760
that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it's the 17th century.

22:15.760 --> 22:18.760
There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks.

22:18.760 --> 22:22.760
But instead, there's teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos.

22:22.760 --> 22:25.760
There's ex-boyfriends revenge posting their girlfriends' nudes.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.760
There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone

22:29.760 --> 22:31.760
for alleged breaches of wokeness.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.760
Public humiliation is a powerful force.

22:33.760 --> 22:35.760
And it's usually...

22:35.760 --> 22:37.760
It's not a good force.

22:37.760 --> 22:39.760
But there are some rare exceptions.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.760
Back in the Gamergate era,

22:41.760 --> 22:44.760
Gamergate itself, of course, being a study in public humiliation,

22:44.760 --> 22:46.760
slut-shaming on a massive online scale,

22:46.760 --> 22:50.760
YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.760
As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks,

22:53.760 --> 22:56.760
and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers

22:56.760 --> 22:58.760
who were constantly mobbed and harassed.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.760
What I see is one of the turning points

23:00.760 --> 23:04.760
in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days

23:04.760 --> 23:07.760
to the left-tube world of today

23:07.760 --> 23:11.760
was a handful of videos uploaded by then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis,

23:11.760 --> 23:14.760
in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual

23:14.760 --> 23:16.760
called Davis Aurini.

23:16.760 --> 23:17.760
Come on, Davis, we have to...

23:17.760 --> 23:19.760
No, stop lecturing me about ethics!

23:19.760 --> 23:20.760
We have to get out of here!

23:20.760 --> 23:23.760
And can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?!

23:23.760 --> 23:25.760
In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate

23:25.760 --> 23:27.760
about the wickedness of women

23:27.760 --> 23:29.760
while posing in front of a toy skull

23:29.760 --> 23:32.760
and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.760
Men of the West, women in our culture,

23:37.760 --> 23:41.760
have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.

23:41.760 --> 23:44.760
And so in discussing sluts versus whores,

23:44.760 --> 23:46.760
I would start with the premise

23:46.760 --> 23:49.760
that all women are whores.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.760
Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views

23:59.760 --> 24:01.760
and a fairly positive response

24:01.760 --> 24:03.760
even from a mostly male gamer audience,

24:03.760 --> 24:06.760
who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.760
Why did these videos work with this audience

24:09.760 --> 24:11.760
where so many others didn't?

24:11.760 --> 24:12.760
Well, I think it's because

24:12.760 --> 24:15.760
Harry didn't moralistically call out Davis

24:15.760 --> 24:18.760
for being problematic or misogynistic.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.760
Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact

24:21.760 --> 24:24.760
that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.

24:24.760 --> 24:26.760
And Davis was a perfect target

24:26.760 --> 24:29.760
because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.760
He had no self-awareness about the fact

24:31.760 --> 24:32.760
that pretty much everyone saw,

24:32.760 --> 24:34.760
through his absurd posturing,

24:34.760 --> 24:36.760
as a badass tough guy by day,

24:36.760 --> 24:38.760
profoundly dark philosopher by night.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.760
We exist in a world with feminized legislation.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.760
I've spoken to men and boys who've told me

24:44.760 --> 24:46.760
that Harry's videos inspired

24:46.760 --> 24:49.760
the beginning of a feminist awakening in them.

24:49.760 --> 24:51.760
Not just because they cringed at Davis Arrheni,

24:51.760 --> 24:54.760
but also because they recognized

24:54.760 --> 24:56.760
a little bit of Davis in themselves.

24:56.760 --> 24:58.760
And they cringed at that too.

24:58.760 --> 25:00.760
Recognizing part of yourself

25:00.760 --> 25:01.760
in a cringe-worthy person

25:01.760 --> 25:03.760
induces self-cringe,

25:03.760 --> 25:06.760
which can motivate you to change your behavior,

25:06.760 --> 25:07.760
your beliefs,

25:07.760 --> 25:09.760
or even your own self-concept.

25:09.760 --> 25:12.760
And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance

25:12.760 --> 25:15.760
of a recognizable stock character on the internet,

25:15.760 --> 25:17.760
namely the Fedora Tipper.

25:17.760 --> 25:20.760
Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader

25:20.760 --> 25:22.760
for traditional masculinity,

25:22.760 --> 25:24.760
but who's basically just a pasty nerd

25:24.760 --> 25:25.760
who can't relate to women.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.760
Davis was such an extreme version of this,

25:27.760 --> 25:30.760
and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments

25:30.760 --> 25:33.760
so frequently that I would classify him

25:33.760 --> 25:36.760
as what the internet calls a lull cow.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.760
Lull cow is old 4chan lingo.

25:38.760 --> 25:41.760
It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric

25:41.760 --> 25:44.760
or foolish behavior can be milked for lulls.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.760
Milking, in this context,

25:46.760 --> 25:48.760
can mean simply watching a lull cow's behavior

25:48.760 --> 25:49.760
and laughing at them,

25:49.760 --> 25:51.760
or it can mean making reaction videos

25:51.760 --> 25:53.760
where you make fun of them,

25:53.760 --> 25:56.760
or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them

25:56.760 --> 25:59.760
to get a response that you find entertaining.

25:59.760 --> 26:01.760
I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,

26:01.760 --> 26:03.760
or my old videos about the Golden One,

26:03.760 --> 26:05.760
as lull cow milking content,

26:05.760 --> 26:07.760
with a political angle.

26:07.760 --> 26:09.760
It was essentially an argument from ridicule,

26:09.760 --> 26:11.760
an argument from cringe,

26:11.760 --> 26:13.760
with the aim of convincing people

26:13.760 --> 26:16.760
don't embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs.

26:16.760 --> 26:17.760
But also,

26:17.760 --> 26:19.760
and I'll just speak for myself here,

26:19.760 --> 26:21.760
I am, at the end of the day,

26:21.760 --> 26:23.760
an entertainer.

26:23.760 --> 26:25.760
And I wanted people to laugh.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.760
There doesn't need to be a political agenda

26:27.760 --> 26:28.760
behind milking lull cows.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.760
In fact, usually, there isn't.

26:30.760 --> 26:33.760
The purest example of a lull cow I can think of

26:33.760 --> 26:35.760
is actually someone from way before the internet,

26:35.760 --> 26:37.760
namely Florence Foster Jenkins.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.760
Jenkins, or Lady Florence,

26:39.760 --> 26:41.760
as she liked to be called,

26:41.760 --> 26:43.760
was an American soprano

26:43.760 --> 26:45.760
who attracted a cult following in New York City

26:45.760 --> 26:47.760
during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s

26:47.760 --> 26:49.760
due to her being such a terrible singer

26:49.760 --> 26:51.760
that people went to her concerts

26:51.760 --> 26:53.760
essentially for the lulls.

26:53.760 --> 26:54.760
She was described as

26:54.760 --> 26:56.760
the world's worst opera singer.

26:56.760 --> 26:57.760
No one,

26:57.760 --> 26:58.760
before or since,

26:58.760 --> 27:00.760
has succeeded in liberating themselves

27:00.760 --> 27:01.760
quite so completely

27:01.760 --> 27:04.760
from the shackles of musical notation.

27:04.760 --> 27:07.760
Behold this fucking camp queen.

27:07.760 --> 27:09.760
Oh, we have no choice but to stan.

27:09.760 --> 27:11.760
Here's a short clip of one of the few recordings she made.

27:17.760 --> 27:18.760
Cringe.

27:18.760 --> 27:20.760
She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,

27:20.760 --> 27:22.760
the William Hung of her age.

27:22.760 --> 27:25.760
Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence

27:25.760 --> 27:26.760
until 1944,

27:26.760 --> 27:28.760
when she was 76 years old,

27:28.760 --> 27:30.760
and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert

27:30.760 --> 27:33.760
to which newspaper critics showed up.

27:33.760 --> 27:34.760
The next morning,

27:34.760 --> 27:35.760
the New York Sun reported,

27:35.760 --> 27:37.760
much of her singing was hopelessly lacking

27:37.760 --> 27:39.760
in a semblance of pitch,

27:39.760 --> 27:42.760
but the further a note was from its proper elevation,

27:42.760 --> 27:45.760
the more the audience laughed and applauded.

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
And five days later,

27:46.760 --> 27:48.760
she had a heart attack and died.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.760
I find something very touching about this story.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.760
I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone

27:52.760 --> 27:54.760
if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,

27:54.760 --> 27:55.760
but I feel so much better.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.760
I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.760
It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell,

28:01.760 --> 28:03.760
at least he tries to stop these people

28:03.760 --> 28:04.760
before things get out of hand.

28:04.760 --> 28:07.760
I think it's normal to have mixed feelings about a lolcow.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.760
Like, yes, this is hilarious,

28:09.760 --> 28:11.760
but on the other hand,

28:11.760 --> 28:13.760
doth not a lolcow bleed?

28:13.760 --> 28:17.760
On some level we know it's wrong to entertain ourselves this way,

28:17.760 --> 28:18.760
but on the other hand,

28:18.760 --> 28:21.760
other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.760
There's a good book about this called The Joy of Pain,

28:24.760 --> 28:27.760
Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature,

28:27.760 --> 28:28.760
by Richard Smith.

28:28.760 --> 28:29.760
Schadenfreude is, of course,

28:29.760 --> 28:31.760
the pleasure we take in other people's misery,

28:31.760 --> 28:34.760
and Smith argues that we experience it

28:34.760 --> 28:35.760
because psychologically,

28:35.760 --> 28:38.760
we gain something when other people lose.

28:38.760 --> 28:40.760
We're constantly evaluating our own worth

28:40.760 --> 28:43.760
by comparing ourselves to other people.

28:43.760 --> 28:45.760
So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,

28:45.760 --> 28:48.760
a pleasant feeling of superiority,

28:48.760 --> 28:51.760
from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,

28:51.760 --> 28:54.760
especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.

28:54.760 --> 28:56.760
Maybe I'm not perfect,

28:56.760 --> 28:58.760
but at least I'm not this lolcow.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.760
And we also get a boost

29:00.760 --> 29:02.760
when people who are socially above us,

29:02.760 --> 29:03.760
whom we envy,

29:03.760 --> 29:05.760
get brought down a peg.

29:05.760 --> 29:07.760
James Charles' cancelled party,

29:07.760 --> 29:09.760
LOLOL.

29:09.760 --> 29:12.760
I think Schadenfreude basically accounts

29:12.760 --> 29:16.760
for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com.

29:16.760 --> 29:18.760
Smith uses the word

29:18.760 --> 29:20.760
for this type of media,

29:20.760 --> 29:22.760
like reality TV shows

29:22.760 --> 29:24.760
designed to produce spectacular moments

29:24.760 --> 29:25.760
of embarrassment.

29:25.760 --> 29:28.760
YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,

29:28.760 --> 29:30.760
or some kind of carnival sideshow.

29:30.760 --> 29:32.760
I mean, take a look around you.

29:32.760 --> 29:34.760
We have Eugenia Cooney,

29:34.760 --> 29:36.760
a YouTuber who, at the time I'm making this video,

29:36.760 --> 29:38.760
remains apparently in total denial

29:38.760 --> 29:39.760
about her eating disorder,

29:39.760 --> 29:41.760
and continues to make videos

29:41.760 --> 29:43.760
modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.

29:43.760 --> 29:44.760
We have Wings of Redemption,

29:44.760 --> 29:46.760
a bad-tempered gamer who,

29:46.760 --> 29:47.760
for a long time,

29:47.760 --> 29:49.760
was essentially confined by poverty,

29:49.760 --> 29:50.760
obesity, and depression

29:50.760 --> 29:52.760
to streaming video games all day

29:52.760 --> 29:53.760
to an audience of trolls

29:53.760 --> 29:55.760
that enjoyed tormenting him.

29:55.760 --> 29:56.760
We have Onision,

29:56.760 --> 29:57.760
a habitual

29:57.760 --> 29:58.760
ALLENGE

29:58.760 --> 30:00.760
abuser of women and teenage girls,

30:00.760 --> 30:01.760
who earlier this year

30:01.760 --> 30:04.760
essentially performed his own mental breakdown

30:04.760 --> 30:05.760
on YouTube

30:05.760 --> 30:06.760
after Patreon banned him

30:06.760 --> 30:08.760
for doxxing an accuser.

30:08.760 --> 30:11.760
I love kombucha!

30:14.760 --> 30:15.760
Whose idea was it

30:15.760 --> 30:17.760
to give hundreds of pathological narcissists

30:17.760 --> 30:19.760
access to video equipment?

30:19.760 --> 30:21.760
What kind of sick social experiment

30:21.760 --> 30:22.760
are we living in?

30:22.760 --> 30:23.760
And the viewers

30:23.760 --> 30:25.760
are no better than the performers.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.760
Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs

30:27.760 --> 30:28.760
makes me sick.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.760
Oh, you people love nothing more

30:30.760 --> 30:32.760
than to watch one of us poor,

30:32.760 --> 30:33.760
helpless egomaniacs

30:33.760 --> 30:35.760
completely lose our minds

30:35.760 --> 30:36.760
live on camera.

30:36.760 --> 30:37.760
Is this what you want, huh?

30:37.760 --> 30:38.760
Is this what-

30:38.760 --> 30:42.760
You wanna total meltdown?

30:42.760 --> 30:43.760
You know, as a creator,

30:43.760 --> 30:45.760
you have to be aware that

30:45.760 --> 30:47.760
you're a circus performer,

30:47.760 --> 30:48.760
and the crowd may in fact

30:48.760 --> 30:50.760
be more entertained

30:50.760 --> 30:51.760
if you fall from the trapeze

30:51.760 --> 30:53.760
and get eaten by the tigers.

30:53.760 --> 30:54.760
Online media today

30:54.760 --> 30:56.760
is full of Lady Florences,

30:56.760 --> 30:58.760
anti-celebrities with anti-fans.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.760
Now, to be clear,

31:00.760 --> 31:02.760
I don't think there's anything inherently wrong

31:02.760 --> 31:04.760
with indulging now and then

31:04.760 --> 31:06.760
in a little bit of light contempt.

31:06.760 --> 31:07.760
Cringing at Davis Aurini

31:07.760 --> 31:09.760
or bad American Idol auditions

31:09.760 --> 31:10.760
seems pretty harmless,

31:10.760 --> 31:12.760
but it can be taken too far.

31:12.760 --> 31:14.760
And there's no better case study

31:14.760 --> 31:16.760
of taking it too far

31:16.760 --> 31:17.760
than the cult following

31:17.760 --> 31:20.760
of one Christine Weston Chandler.

31:20.760 --> 31:22.760
If you don't know what's coming,

31:22.760 --> 31:23.760
you might want to strap in, Gorge,

31:23.760 --> 31:26.760
because this is coconuts.

31:26.760 --> 31:27.760
It's bananas.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.760
It's a full fruit salad.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.760
God, how do I even begin to explain this?

31:31.760 --> 31:34.760
Well, Christine Weston Chandler,

31:34.760 --> 31:36.760
more commonly known on the internet

31:36.760 --> 31:38.760
as Chris-Chan,

31:38.760 --> 31:40.760
is the victim

31:40.760 --> 31:42.760
of what is quite possibly

31:42.760 --> 31:44.760
the longest-running

31:44.760 --> 31:45.760
and most obsessive

31:45.760 --> 31:48.760
internet trolling saga of all time.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.760
She's the lolcow of lols.

31:50.760 --> 31:51.760
Hello, everybody.

31:51.760 --> 31:52.760
This is Christine Chandler

31:52.760 --> 31:54.760
coming to you live from home once again.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.760
Chandler is an autistic trans woman.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.760
And yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,

31:59.760 --> 32:01.760
which I pause to explain

32:01.760 --> 32:03.760
because I don't think I've ever seen anyone

32:03.760 --> 32:05.760
actually take her transition seriously.

32:05.760 --> 32:07.760
Most people seem to regard it as

32:07.760 --> 32:09.760
simply another absurd symptom

32:09.760 --> 32:11.760
of her hilarious mental condition.

32:11.760 --> 32:12.760
In fact, a bunch of trans people

32:12.760 --> 32:14.760
will probably get real salty with me

32:14.760 --> 32:17.760
for making trans people look bad

32:17.760 --> 32:19.760
by including Chris-Chan in our Oats.

32:19.760 --> 32:23.760
Oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club.

32:23.760 --> 32:24.760
Oh, please.

32:24.760 --> 32:27.760
Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.760
This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.

32:30.760 --> 32:33.760
God, how did trannies get so snobbish?

32:33.760 --> 32:36.760
Look, is Chris-Chan really trans?

32:36.760 --> 32:38.760
I don't know.

32:38.760 --> 32:40.760
And I don't care.

32:40.760 --> 32:42.760
If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman,

32:42.760 --> 32:44.760
I for one support her journey.

32:44.760 --> 32:45.760
But it doesn't matter.

32:45.760 --> 32:47.760
The relevant thing about Chris-Chan

32:47.760 --> 32:48.760
is not Chris-Chan.

32:48.760 --> 32:51.760
It's the fact that for the last 13 years,

32:51.760 --> 32:53.760
nearly every aspect of her life

32:53.760 --> 32:56.760
has been obsessively archived online

32:56.760 --> 33:00.760
by thousands of voyeurs known as Chris-storians.

33:00.760 --> 33:03.760
Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom

33:03.760 --> 33:05.760
several internet centuries ago,

33:05.760 --> 33:07.760
back in 2007,

33:07.760 --> 33:10.760
when 4chan took notice of her comic book series Sonichu,

33:10.760 --> 33:14.760
a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu.

33:14.760 --> 33:17.760
The comic is set in Quickville, CWC,

33:17.760 --> 33:19.760
being Chris-Chan's initials.

33:19.760 --> 33:21.760
The protagonist is a self-insert

33:21.760 --> 33:23.760
who references Chandler's real-life

33:23.760 --> 33:24.760
quote,

33:24.760 --> 33:25.760
love quest

33:25.760 --> 33:26.760
to find a quote,

33:26.760 --> 33:27.760
boyfriend-free girl,

33:27.760 --> 33:29.760
which apparently involved posting bizarre

33:29.760 --> 33:31.760
attraction signs

33:31.760 --> 33:33.760
around her community college.

33:33.760 --> 33:34.760
For this story to make sense,

33:34.760 --> 33:35.760
you have to keep in mind

33:35.760 --> 33:38.760
that Chandler identified and presented as male

33:38.760 --> 33:39.760
until 2015.

33:39.760 --> 33:42.760
So these trolls saw her as like

33:42.760 --> 33:45.760
the ultimate autistic incel man-child.

33:45.760 --> 33:47.760
Just to give you a feel for this,

33:47.760 --> 33:49.760
here's Christine in 2018

33:49.760 --> 33:52.760
holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.760
Note the Sonichu medallions.

33:54.760 --> 33:55.760
Here's the bedroom she lived in,

33:55.760 --> 33:57.760
and here she is in recent years

33:57.760 --> 34:00.760
giving us a full Bronycon eleganza.

34:00.760 --> 34:02.760
Pegasister snapped.

34:02.760 --> 34:04.760
Basically she's the entire cringetopia subreddit

34:04.760 --> 34:06.760
condensed into a single person.

34:06.760 --> 34:09.760
So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit,

34:09.760 --> 34:10.760
cause of course they did,

34:10.760 --> 34:12.760
and they began tormenting her

34:12.760 --> 34:15.760
by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,

34:15.760 --> 34:16.760
posting candid photos of her,

34:16.760 --> 34:18.760
etc.

34:18.760 --> 34:19.760
Chandler reacted to the trolls,

34:19.760 --> 34:21.760
which of course encouraged them more,

34:21.760 --> 34:24.760
and the harassment escalated and escalated.

34:24.760 --> 34:25.760
They hacked her accounts,

34:25.760 --> 34:27.760
or tricked her into giving out passwords,

34:27.760 --> 34:29.760
they posted all her emails online,

34:29.760 --> 34:32.760
they showed up in person and photographed her house,

34:32.760 --> 34:33.760
they called her parents,

34:33.760 --> 34:34.760
posing as friends,

34:34.760 --> 34:35.760
psychiatrists,

34:35.760 --> 34:36.760
journalists,

34:36.760 --> 34:37.760
employers,

34:37.760 --> 34:39.760
in order to extract as much information

34:39.760 --> 34:40.760
about her as possible.

34:40.760 --> 34:43.760
And of course they contacted Chandler herself,

34:43.760 --> 34:45.760
which was very rewarding for trolls,

34:45.760 --> 34:47.760
because she has no filter,

34:47.760 --> 34:49.760
and was very naive and trusting.

34:49.760 --> 34:51.760
So she was very willing to divulge,

34:51.760 --> 34:53.760
or easily manipulated into divulging,

34:53.760 --> 34:56.760
mortifying information about herself.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.760
Sexual, psychological,

34:58.760 --> 34:59.760
scatological,

34:59.760 --> 35:02.760
there's not really any limits or boundaries to this.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.760
For all the information they gathered,

35:04.760 --> 35:06.760
the trolls created a wiki,

35:06.760 --> 35:07.760
called the Quickie,

35:07.760 --> 35:09.760
devoted to the obsessive compiling

35:09.760 --> 35:11.760
of all Chris Chan data.

35:11.760 --> 35:14.760
It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,

35:14.760 --> 35:18.760
entire articles about all members of her immediate and extended family,

35:18.760 --> 35:22.760
pages of psychiatric records she was tricked into sending them,

35:22.760 --> 35:24.760
and that's only the beginning.

35:24.760 --> 35:27.760
In their more grandiose moods,

35:27.760 --> 35:29.760
the Chris-torians have speculated

35:29.760 --> 35:32.760
that Chris Chan is the most documented life

35:32.760 --> 35:34.760
in all human history,

35:34.760 --> 35:36.760
comparing their social expair-tainment

35:36.760 --> 35:38.760
to the Truman Show.

35:38.760 --> 35:40.760
It's a level of obsession

35:40.760 --> 35:43.760
that surpasses the wildest excesses of Stan culture.

35:43.760 --> 35:45.760
It's a gaze into the abyss

35:45.760 --> 35:47.760
that does not blink.

35:49.760 --> 35:52.760
Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,

35:52.760 --> 35:54.760
or on one occasion, sex workers,

35:54.760 --> 35:56.760
to the Chandler household.

35:56.760 --> 36:00.760
Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates with Chris Chan,

36:00.760 --> 36:04.760
of course secretly wearing wires to record their conversations.

36:04.760 --> 36:07.760
Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends

36:07.760 --> 36:11.760
so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.760
These things must be awful.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.760
They're archived, don't you understand?

36:15.760 --> 36:18.760
Chris Chan must be documented.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.760
The absolute low point came

36:20.760 --> 36:23.760
when some trolls encouraged a 13-year-old boy

36:23.760 --> 36:26.760
to pose as a 19-year-old girl

36:26.760 --> 36:29.760
and have phone sex with Chris Chan and record it.

36:29.760 --> 36:30.760
In other words,

36:30.760 --> 36:32.760
they groomed a child

36:32.760 --> 36:34.760
to deceive an autistic person

36:34.760 --> 36:38.760
into performing sex acts for their entertainment.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.760
Now, to contemporary Chris-torians,

36:40.760 --> 36:42.760
this sort of sadistic interference

36:42.760 --> 36:44.760
in Christine's life is frowned upon.

36:44.760 --> 36:46.760
Not so much because it's immoral,

36:46.760 --> 36:49.760
so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,

36:49.760 --> 36:51.760
a bit attention-seeking.

36:51.760 --> 36:55.760
No, to the sophisticated Chris-torian,

36:55.760 --> 36:57.760
the real pleasure in all this

36:57.760 --> 37:00.760
is supposed to lie in quietly spectating,

37:00.760 --> 37:03.760
savoring the fine notes of cringe.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.760
Now, I take it I don't even need to comment

37:06.760 --> 37:08.760
on the morality of all this.

37:08.760 --> 37:11.760
The real question to me is why?

37:11.760 --> 37:13.760
Why do thousands of people

37:13.760 --> 37:17.760
have a morbid obsession with Christine Chandler?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.760
And yes, it is an obsession.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.760
Just to give you a sense of a single individual's

37:21.760 --> 37:23.760
personal investment in this,

37:23.760 --> 37:25.760
the YouTuber Gino Samuel,

37:25.760 --> 37:27.760
one of very few Chris-torians

37:27.760 --> 37:29.760
with the audacity to show his face,

37:29.760 --> 37:32.760
has been working for more than two years

37:32.760 --> 37:37.760
to produce an eventual 100-episode documentary series

37:37.760 --> 37:39.760
about the life of Chris Chan.

37:39.760 --> 37:41.760
Gino has completed 36 episodes

37:41.760 --> 37:44.760
so far, and each episode is around 40 minutes long,

37:44.760 --> 37:48.760
meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video

37:48.760 --> 37:50.760
about the life of what is essentially

37:50.760 --> 37:52.760
a random stranger.

37:52.760 --> 37:55.760
I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.

37:55.760 --> 37:57.760
I'll call it morbid cringe,

37:57.760 --> 37:59.760
defined as an obsessive and addictive

37:59.760 --> 38:01.760
contemptuous fascination

38:01.760 --> 38:04.760
with a particular person or group.

38:04.760 --> 38:06.760
Why does morbid cringe happen?

38:06.760 --> 38:08.760
Well, I've spent some time

38:08.760 --> 38:10.760
poring over Chris-torians' conversations

38:10.760 --> 38:11.760
with each other,

38:11.760 --> 38:13.760
and I've even interrogated a couple of them,

38:13.760 --> 38:15.760
and this is what I've found.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.760
The first thing they'll tell you is that

38:17.760 --> 38:19.760
they just think it's funny and entertaining,

38:19.760 --> 38:21.760
that Christine's strange life and mind

38:21.760 --> 38:24.760
simply appeals to their morbid curiosity.

38:24.760 --> 38:26.760
And I'm sure that's true.

38:26.760 --> 38:29.760
But a lot of things are funny and entertaining

38:29.760 --> 38:31.760
and morbidly interesting.

38:31.760 --> 38:34.760
Why fixate on this particular person?

38:34.760 --> 38:37.760
Well, for a lot of them, it's a reassurance

38:37.760 --> 38:39.760
that there's someone out there

38:39.760 --> 38:41.760
worse than them.

38:41.760 --> 38:43.760
Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,

38:43.760 --> 38:46.760
but at least this defenseless punching bag

38:46.760 --> 38:48.760
called Chris-Chan is here for them

38:48.760 --> 38:50.760
to assert their superiority over.

38:50.760 --> 38:52.760
It's pretty much common knowledge

38:52.760 --> 38:54.760
that a lot of Chris-torians,

38:54.760 --> 38:56.760
including some of the most vocal haters,

38:56.760 --> 38:58.760
are autistic themselves.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.760
And a frequent justification

39:00.760 --> 39:02.760
given for trolling Chris-Chan

39:02.760 --> 39:06.760
is that she's giving autistics a bad name.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.760
In recent years, there's also been

39:08.760 --> 39:11.760
a small contingent of transgender trolls

39:11.760 --> 39:13.760
who are likewise prone to say,

39:13.760 --> 39:16.760
he's not a real transgender like me

39:16.760 --> 39:19.760
and he's making us all look bad.

39:19.760 --> 39:24.760
Oh yeah, cause people who troll Chris-Chan?

39:24.760 --> 39:27.760
You guys look amazing.

39:27.760 --> 39:30.760
It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this

39:30.760 --> 39:33.760
about why trolling Chandler is justified,

39:33.760 --> 39:35.760
righteous even.

39:35.760 --> 39:37.760
Because, at the end of the day,

39:37.760 --> 39:40.760
trolls are people too.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.760
And a lot of them actually do have

39:42.760 --> 39:44.760
a guilty conscience about this,

39:44.760 --> 39:46.760
which they suppress by insisting

39:46.760 --> 39:49.760
that Chris-Chan is a horrible person

39:49.760 --> 39:51.760
who deserves to be tormented.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.760
But trolls who protest too much

39:53.760 --> 39:55.760
about the evils of Chris-Chan,

39:55.760 --> 39:57.760
and therefore reveal the excess

39:57.760 --> 40:00.760
of their emotional investment in this,

40:00.760 --> 40:03.760
are known in the community as A-logs.

40:03.760 --> 40:05.760
A-log is the name of a troll

40:05.760 --> 40:07.760
who attracted the eyes of people

40:07.760 --> 40:09.760
who are aware of other trolls

40:09.760 --> 40:12.760
by ranting about Chris-Chan's crimes,

40:12.760 --> 40:14.760
comparing her to Hitler,

40:14.760 --> 40:18.760
and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.

40:18.760 --> 40:19.760
Among the trolls,

40:19.760 --> 40:21.760
this kind of behavior is considered

40:21.760 --> 40:23.760
an embarrassment to all of them

40:23.760 --> 40:25.760
because they want to feel

40:25.760 --> 40:28.760
like they're just coolly and casually

40:28.760 --> 40:30.760
toying with this person.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.760
You know, just for laughs.

40:33.760 --> 40:35.760
Not a big deal.

40:35.760 --> 40:37.760
Perfectly healthy,

40:37.760 --> 40:38.760
and normal,

40:38.760 --> 40:40.760
and fine.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.760
It's fine.

40:43.760 --> 40:46.760
But A-log gave the lie to that illusion

40:46.760 --> 40:49.760
because it was obvious that his Chris-Chan obsession

40:49.760 --> 40:51.760
wasn't healthy,

40:51.760 --> 40:52.760
or normal,

40:52.760 --> 40:54.760
or fine.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.760
So the other trolls turned on A-log,

40:56.760 --> 40:58.760
and they made him into Chris-Chan 2.0,

40:58.760 --> 41:00.760
and they uncovered his autism,

41:00.760 --> 41:02.760
and his furry porn collection,

41:02.760 --> 41:04.760
and his cringy erotic fanfiction.

41:05.760 --> 41:09.760
So why would someone as similar to Chris-Chan as A-log

41:09.760 --> 41:11.760
obsessively hate on her?

41:11.760 --> 41:13.760
Well, there's two explanations.

41:13.760 --> 41:15.760
One is troll-shielding.

41:15.760 --> 41:19.760
That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris-Chan

41:19.760 --> 41:21.760
and spearheaded the trolling efforts

41:21.760 --> 41:23.760
in order to protect himself

41:23.760 --> 41:25.760
from being targeted by trolls.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.760
The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob

41:28.760 --> 41:31.760
by waving your pitchfork the hardest.

41:31.760 --> 41:33.760
Obviously, this did not work.

41:33.760 --> 41:35.760
The other explanation is that,

41:35.760 --> 41:39.760
A-log saw himself reflected in Chris-Chan,

41:39.760 --> 41:42.760
and sort of projected his own shame

41:42.760 --> 41:45.760
and self-contempt onto her.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.760
A-log hated Chris-Chan

41:47.760 --> 41:49.760
because he saw part of himself in her.

41:49.760 --> 41:52.760
And the other trolls hated A-log

41:52.760 --> 41:55.760
because they saw part of themselves in him.

41:55.760 --> 41:56.760
To quote Margaret Pless,

41:56.760 --> 41:58.760
who covered this story for New York Magazine

41:58.760 --> 41:59.760
a few years ago,

41:59.760 --> 42:02.760
I think it might be A-log's all the way down.

42:02.760 --> 42:05.760
People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-Chan,

42:05.760 --> 42:07.760
because to them she's a symbol

42:07.760 --> 42:09.760
of something they hate about themselves,

42:09.760 --> 42:11.760
something they're ashamed of.

42:11.760 --> 42:13.760
Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum,

42:13.760 --> 42:16.760
or being a socially awkward recluse.

42:16.760 --> 42:19.760
Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents,

42:19.760 --> 42:22.760
or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons,

42:22.760 --> 42:25.760
or embarrassing sexual proclivities,

42:25.760 --> 42:27.760
or all of the above.

42:27.760 --> 42:29.760
This is how scapegoating works, right?

42:29.760 --> 42:32.760
You repress your uncomfortable feelings

42:32.760 --> 42:35.760
of shame and insecurity and self-loathing.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.760
And you displace them onto someone else,

42:38.760 --> 42:41.760
usually someone you can feel superior to.

42:41.760 --> 42:44.760
Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat,

42:44.760 --> 42:48.760
transforming your painful shame and self-loathing

42:48.760 --> 42:51.760
into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.

42:51.760 --> 42:53.760
It's pretty safe to assume

42:53.760 --> 42:56.760
that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls

42:56.760 --> 42:58.760
are some kind of social outcasts,

42:58.760 --> 43:00.760
much like Chris-Chan.

43:00.760 --> 43:04.760
So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris-Chan

43:04.760 --> 43:07.760
is a way of processing the shame and anxiety

43:07.760 --> 43:10.760
of social rejection and exclusion.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.760
And I think for a lot of people, even normal people,

43:13.760 --> 43:16.760
who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,

43:16.760 --> 43:18.760
contemptuous cringing helps us cope

43:18.760 --> 43:20.760
with our own shame and insecurity.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.760
Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious

43:22.760 --> 43:24.760
empathizing with other people

43:24.760 --> 43:27.760
and find a way to make this all about me.

43:34.760 --> 43:58.760
.

43:58.760 --> 43:59.760
Meow meow.

43:59.760 --> 44:02.760
Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend?

44:02.760 --> 44:03.760
Would you like to meet my...

44:03.760 --> 44:04.760
.

44:04.760 --> 44:05.760
boyfriend's boyfriend?

44:05.760 --> 44:06.760
That's right, honey,

44:06.760 --> 44:08.760
I'm giving you fujoshi realness, nya.

44:08.760 --> 44:10.760
He's gonna stay right here as a grim reminder

44:10.760 --> 44:12.760
of the things that you have seen.

44:12.760 --> 44:14.760
Actually, I identify as a trap.

44:14.760 --> 44:15.760
It's very that.

44:15.760 --> 44:18.760
I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.

44:18.760 --> 44:20.760
Cringe is failed seriousness.

44:20.760 --> 44:21.760
In my last video,

44:21.760 --> 44:23.760
I talked about how ashamed I am

44:23.760 --> 44:25.760
of being a transgender lesbian.

44:25.760 --> 44:26.760
Cringe.

44:26.760 --> 44:27.760
Shame.

44:27.760 --> 44:28.760
At the end of that video,

44:28.760 --> 44:30.760
I talk about how I sense that my shame

44:30.760 --> 44:33.760
is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel

44:33.760 --> 44:35.760
for a lot of other trans lesbians,

44:35.760 --> 44:37.760
particularly those of the heckin' stripey sock,

44:37.760 --> 44:39.760
nya nya, catgirl variety.

44:39.760 --> 44:42.760
But I confess to periodically sinking

44:42.760 --> 44:45.760
into these morbid, guilty binges

44:45.760 --> 44:47.760
of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.

44:47.760 --> 44:49.760
I want to return to that thought

44:49.760 --> 44:51.760
and kind of psychoanalyze myself

44:51.760 --> 44:53.760
as a kind of first-person case study

44:53.760 --> 44:55.760
of a morbid cringe obsession.

44:55.760 --> 44:59.760
So, uh, catgirl trans girls are...

44:59.760 --> 45:02.760
Okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.

45:02.760 --> 45:05.760
They're trans women, usually attracted to women,

45:05.760 --> 45:08.760
who express their identity online

45:08.760 --> 45:13.760
through cloying, neotenous, otaku memery.

45:13.760 --> 45:15.760
And my conscious reason for cringing at them

45:15.760 --> 45:19.760
is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls

45:19.760 --> 45:21.760
as a kind of visual baby talk,

45:21.760 --> 45:24.760
an infantilized and unrealistic representation

45:24.760 --> 45:26.760
of femininity and womanhood

45:26.760 --> 45:29.760
that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.760
So when trans women identify with it,

45:31.760 --> 45:32.760
I cringe.

45:32.760 --> 45:33.760
Like, no.

45:33.760 --> 45:35.760
You can't become an anime girl, Lily.

45:35.760 --> 45:37.760
Fuck your dreams.

45:37.760 --> 45:39.760
Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked

45:39.760 --> 45:41.760
with a discussion of whether my opinions

45:41.760 --> 45:43.760
about catgirls are fair or correct.

45:43.760 --> 45:46.760
So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.

45:46.760 --> 45:49.760
Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.

45:49.760 --> 45:52.760
Listen to the contempt beneath my words.

45:52.760 --> 45:55.760
Because even if everything I'm saying is true,

45:55.760 --> 45:58.760
catgirls are being cringe online

45:58.760 --> 46:00.760
is a situation so inconsequential

46:00.760 --> 46:04.760
that any amount of emotional energy spent on it

46:04.760 --> 46:05.760
is too much.

46:05.760 --> 46:08.760
So why do I have this cringe fixation?

46:08.760 --> 46:12.760
Well, according to the A-log theory of morbid cringing,

46:12.760 --> 46:14.760
we form obsessive and addictive contempt

46:14.760 --> 46:17.760
for people who have traits in common with us,

46:17.760 --> 46:19.760
people who make us uncomfortable

46:19.760 --> 46:22.760
because we see something of ourselves in them.

46:22.760 --> 46:25.760
So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?

46:25.760 --> 46:28.760
Well, we're both trans women,

46:28.760 --> 46:30.760
we're both attracted to women,

46:30.760 --> 46:34.760
uh, I do like anime, but

46:34.760 --> 46:36.760
I don't like the anime they like, okay?

46:36.760 --> 46:39.760
I like good anime that has, you know,

46:39.760 --> 46:41.760
mature, three-dimensional female characters.

46:41.760 --> 46:43.760
Look, I'm a real transgender, okay?

46:43.760 --> 46:44.760
I'm not like you.

46:44.760 --> 46:46.760
It's also not lost on me that this is like

46:46.760 --> 46:47.760
the seventh time on this channel

46:47.760 --> 46:49.760
I've dressed as a catgirl

46:49.760 --> 46:51.760
to make fun of them.

46:54.760 --> 46:56.760
I have posted cringe.

46:56.760 --> 46:58.760
You should all be laughing at me right now.

46:58.760 --> 47:00.760
Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.

47:00.760 --> 47:02.760
So I do think there's some truth to the idea

47:02.760 --> 47:04.760
that I'm A-logging these catgirls.

47:04.760 --> 47:07.760
I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.760
Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe

47:10.760 --> 47:13.760
at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,

47:13.760 --> 47:15.760
because of how these catgirls are acting.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.760
So let's make another distinction between

47:17.760 --> 47:19.760
in-group cringe and out-group cringe.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.760
In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone

47:21.760 --> 47:23.760
who belongs to the same group identity as you.

47:23.760 --> 47:26.760
For example, your family, your romantic partnership,

47:26.760 --> 47:28.760
your ethnicity, or your country.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.760
Particularly if they're embarrassing themselves

47:30.760 --> 47:32.760
in front of outsiders to the group.

47:32.760 --> 47:35.760
Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets

47:35.760 --> 47:37.760
if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends.

47:37.760 --> 47:40.760
Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get

47:40.760 --> 47:42.760
when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump

47:42.760 --> 47:44.760
being our president.

47:44.760 --> 47:46.760
Or think about these phrases.

47:46.760 --> 47:48.760
She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.

47:48.760 --> 47:50.760
They're making trans people look bad.

47:50.760 --> 47:52.760
He's giving autistics a bad name.

47:52.760 --> 47:55.760
When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,

47:55.760 --> 47:57.760
we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment,

47:57.760 --> 48:00.760
we feel embarrassment,

48:00.760 --> 48:03.760
because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too.

48:03.760 --> 48:07.760
So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,

48:07.760 --> 48:09.760
because you're cringing at your membership

48:09.760 --> 48:11.760
in an embarrassing group.

48:11.760 --> 48:13.760
Nothing has ever triggered this kind of

48:13.760 --> 48:15.760
in-group embarrassment more for me

48:15.760 --> 48:17.760
than a cringe video that went viral last year,

48:17.760 --> 48:21.760
in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum

48:21.760 --> 48:23.760
over being misgendered in a GameStop.

48:23.760 --> 48:25.760
You're not getting my fucking money back!

48:25.760 --> 48:27.760
Excuse me sir, there's a young man in here.

48:27.760 --> 48:29.760
Excuse me, it's ma'am.

48:29.760 --> 48:31.760
It is ma'am!

48:31.760 --> 48:34.760
This video is excruciating for me to watch.

48:34.760 --> 48:36.760
Motherfucker, take it outside!

48:36.760 --> 48:38.760
If you want to call me sir again,

48:38.760 --> 48:40.760
I will show you a fucking sir!

48:40.760 --> 48:42.760
Motherfucker!

48:43.760 --> 48:46.760
The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly

48:46.760 --> 48:49.760
intimidate people into seeing you as a woman.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.760
Now Twitter's gonna come for me over this and say,

48:54.760 --> 48:56.760
Natalie hates trans women, hey don't pass!

48:56.760 --> 48:59.760
But passing is really not what this is about.

48:59.760 --> 49:04.760
It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior

49:04.760 --> 49:07.760
from a trans woman, accompanied by apparently

49:07.760 --> 49:10.760
total delusion about how she's presenting.

49:10.760 --> 49:12.760
Well I'm gonna ask you for the fifth time

49:12.760 --> 49:14.760
to stop calling me a man!

49:14.760 --> 49:16.760
Because quite clearly I am not!

49:16.760 --> 49:18.760
It's really not that clear, Gorge.

49:18.760 --> 49:20.760
And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?

49:20.760 --> 49:23.760
The incongruity between her thinking that

49:23.760 --> 49:25.760
she's serving women, while

49:25.760 --> 49:28.760
bellowing like a drill sergeant.

49:28.760 --> 49:29.760
By the way, what I'm doing right now,

49:29.760 --> 49:31.760
this is cringe reaction content.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.760
I don't really do that on this channel, but

49:33.760 --> 49:35.760
I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.

49:35.760 --> 49:37.760
And it feels good. Like,

49:37.760 --> 49:39.760
intoxicatingly good.

49:39.760 --> 49:41.760
I can see how you could get addicted to this.

49:41.760 --> 49:43.760
I'm imagining myself right now,

49:43.760 --> 49:45.760
surrounded by cis people,

49:45.760 --> 49:47.760
and I am leading the righteous mob

49:47.760 --> 49:49.760
as we point and laugh

49:49.760 --> 49:52.760
at some delusional, manly dump truck.

49:52.760 --> 49:54.760
I am a real transgender.

49:54.760 --> 49:55.760
A true transgender.

49:55.760 --> 49:57.760
A good transgender.

49:57.760 --> 49:59.760
Father finally approves of me.

49:59.760 --> 50:02.760
Uh, this would be the unconscious, archetypal father.

50:02.760 --> 50:04.760
Jot that down in my progress notes please, Doctor.

50:04.760 --> 50:06.760
Okay, so why does this feel so good?

50:06.760 --> 50:08.760
Well, let me talk you through my feelings.

50:08.760 --> 50:10.760
When I watched that GameStop video,

50:10.760 --> 50:12.760
for the first few seconds,

50:12.760 --> 50:14.760
I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.

50:14.760 --> 50:16.760
I can even relate, cause in the first couple months

50:16.760 --> 50:18.760
of my transition, there was an occasion

50:18.760 --> 50:20.760
where I was in a lengthy

50:20.760 --> 50:22.760
customer service interaction

50:22.760 --> 50:24.760
where the guy at the desk was

50:24.760 --> 50:26.760
calling me sir the entire time.

50:26.760 --> 50:28.760
And there's something very humiliating

50:28.760 --> 50:30.760
about trying to present female,

50:30.760 --> 50:32.760
like wearing a dress and makeup,

50:32.760 --> 50:34.760
and yet being called sir.

50:34.760 --> 50:36.760
It's a quintessential mismatch between

50:36.760 --> 50:38.760
self-concept and the way other people are seeing you.

50:38.760 --> 50:40.760
And the memory of it is painful to me,

50:40.760 --> 50:42.760
but what I cling to

50:42.760 --> 50:44.760
is that while I may have

50:44.760 --> 50:46.760
looked like a man, at least

50:46.760 --> 50:48.760
I didn't act like a man.

50:48.760 --> 50:50.760
I didn't threaten to take anyone outside

50:50.760 --> 50:52.760
and show them a sir.

50:52.760 --> 50:54.760
In fact, I was too ashamed to even

50:54.760 --> 50:56.760
correct the guy.

50:56.760 --> 50:58.760
So as the GameStop video progresses,

50:58.760 --> 51:00.760
my sympathy runs out fast.

51:00.760 --> 51:02.760
And instead of compassionate cringe,

51:02.760 --> 51:04.760
I feel group embarrassment for trans women,

51:04.760 --> 51:06.760
including myself.

51:06.760 --> 51:08.760
And I feel contempt toward this individual

51:08.760 --> 51:10.760
for making us all look bad.

51:10.760 --> 51:12.760
I also feel a kind of morbid

51:12.760 --> 51:14.760
fascination rooted in fear.

51:14.760 --> 51:16.760
What if I'm as delusional as

51:16.760 --> 51:18.760
that trans woman?

51:18.760 --> 51:20.760
I don't look and sound like that, do I?

51:20.760 --> 51:22.760
I feel like I have to do a sanity check.

51:22.760 --> 51:24.760
I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,

51:24.760 --> 51:26.760
because of my voice, just to make sure.

51:26.760 --> 51:28.760
And that fear motivates me to distance

51:28.760 --> 51:30.760
myself from that person in the video.

51:30.760 --> 51:32.760
I don't feel compassion for her,

51:32.760 --> 51:34.760
because that would mean putting myself

51:34.760 --> 51:36.760
in her size 16 shoes.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.760
And I don't want to do that,

51:38.760 --> 51:40.760
because I'm horrified and repulsed

51:40.760 --> 51:42.760
by the thought that I'm like her in some way.

51:42.760 --> 51:44.760
So I want to push away.

51:44.760 --> 51:46.760
And contempt is a way of emotionally

51:46.760 --> 51:48.760
distancing myself.

51:48.760 --> 51:50.760
And if I express that contempt by publicly

51:50.760 --> 51:52.760
shaming and condemning her,

51:52.760 --> 51:54.760
then I'm also socially distancing myself.

51:54.760 --> 51:56.760
Oops. Guess it's, uh,

51:56.760 --> 51:58.760
contagious.

51:58.760 --> 52:00.760
I think many people who are stigmatized

52:00.760 --> 52:02.760
or who have been humiliated

52:02.760 --> 52:04.760
long for the experience

52:04.760 --> 52:06.760
of being a normal, surrounded

52:06.760 --> 52:08.760
by fellow normals, judging

52:08.760 --> 52:10.760
and humiliating a freak.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.760
And if you take a look around trans YouTube,

52:12.760 --> 52:14.760
a lot of the biggest creators in the

52:14.760 --> 52:16.760
platform have channels

52:16.760 --> 52:18.760
basically devoted to exactly

52:18.760 --> 52:20.760
this type of cringe reaction

52:20.760 --> 52:22.760
humilitainment. The YouTuber

52:22.760 --> 52:24.760
Calvin Guerra is a trans guy whose best

52:24.760 --> 52:26.760
known for what are essentially cringe

52:26.760 --> 52:28.760
reaction videos, mostly aimed at

52:28.760 --> 52:30.760
people he deems trans-trenders.

52:30.760 --> 52:32.760
That is, people who claim to be

52:32.760 --> 52:34.760
trans, but who aren't real

52:34.760 --> 52:36.760
transgenders like Calvin.

52:36.760 --> 52:38.760
He's especially bothered by girly,

52:38.760 --> 52:40.760
afab, trans and non-binary

52:40.760 --> 52:42.760
teenagers, or by anyone who

52:42.760 --> 52:44.760
blurs the line between lesbian

52:44.760 --> 52:46.760
and transmasculine identities.

52:46.760 --> 52:48.760
Sometimes he'll do a long-form reaction to a

52:48.760 --> 52:50.760
specific person who grinds his gears.

52:50.760 --> 52:52.760
So this person is an asexual,

52:52.760 --> 52:54.760
non-binary,

52:54.760 --> 52:56.760
transgender,

52:56.760 --> 52:58.760
lesbian, who uses he,

52:58.760 --> 53:00.760
they, it, thons

53:00.760 --> 53:02.760
pronouns. According to my calculations,

53:02.760 --> 53:04.760
you are a trans-trender.

53:04.760 --> 53:06.760
In other times, he'll basically

53:06.760 --> 53:08.760
just laugh at cringy trans TikTok

53:08.760 --> 53:10.760
teens.

53:10.760 --> 53:12.760
No, no, I'm

53:12.760 --> 53:14.760
turning off the video. I can't watch

53:14.760 --> 53:16.760
this. He has a couple justifications

53:16.760 --> 53:18.760
for making these videos. One is that he's

53:18.760 --> 53:20.760
actually helping the people he's cringing at,

53:20.760 --> 53:22.760
because if a trender transitions,

53:22.760 --> 53:24.760
then they'll get dysphoria and have to detrend.

53:24.760 --> 53:26.760
But I have to wonder,

53:26.760 --> 53:28.760
does humiliating or laughing at people

53:28.760 --> 53:30.760
really help them figure out whether they're trans

53:30.760 --> 53:32.760
or not? His other justification is that

53:32.760 --> 53:34.760
trans-trenders are giving real trans

53:34.760 --> 53:36.760
people a bad name. They're the reason

53:36.760 --> 53:38.760
people are transphobic. This is why

53:38.760 --> 53:40.760
they hate us. It's because of

53:40.760 --> 53:42.760
the trenders. Wow, I love

53:42.760 --> 53:44.760
that idea of a true scum furry.

53:44.760 --> 53:46.760
Isn't that just, isn't that just

53:46.760 --> 53:48.760
wonderful? A true scum furry!

53:48.760 --> 53:50.760
Uh, but it's not, though.

53:50.760 --> 53:52.760
I mean, transphobia existed

53:52.760 --> 53:54.760
long before there were people you could plausibly

53:54.760 --> 53:56.760
describe as trans-trenders.

53:56.760 --> 53:58.760
So trans-trenders aren't the reason

53:58.760 --> 54:00.760
society hates trans people, Calvin.

54:00.760 --> 54:02.760
They're the reason you hate trans people, right?

54:02.760 --> 54:04.760
Or at least the trans community. And I feel like

54:04.760 --> 54:06.760
what you're doing is you're projecting that feeling onto

54:06.760 --> 54:08.760
society at large, and you're saying,

54:08.760 --> 54:10.760
oh, this is the reason people are transphobic.

54:10.760 --> 54:12.760
And to be fair, I get that it's not

54:12.760 --> 54:14.760
just a projection. Like, back in

54:14.760 --> 54:16.760
2016, the SJW cringe era,

54:16.760 --> 54:18.760
it was cis people mocking

54:18.760 --> 54:20.760
trans people with all these tropes.

54:20.760 --> 54:22.760
Attack helicopter, two genders,

54:22.760 --> 54:24.760
36 genders, special snowflakes.

54:24.760 --> 54:26.760
But now, they're used by trans people

54:26.760 --> 54:28.760
trying to distance themselves,

54:28.760 --> 54:30.760
trying to ghettoize the most laughed at

54:30.760 --> 54:32.760
people in the community under the label of

54:32.760 --> 54:34.760
trans-trenders. And Calvin, there may

54:34.760 --> 54:36.760
be some truth to what you're saying about there being

54:36.760 --> 54:38.760
confused teenagers who think they're trans when

54:38.760 --> 54:40.760
they're not. I mean, I wouldn't know. I'm a

54:40.760 --> 54:42.760
near-dead woman in the twilight of my life, and I don't

54:42.760 --> 54:44.760
hang out with teenagers. But even if it is true,

54:44.760 --> 54:46.760
Calvin, your fixation

54:46.760 --> 54:48.760
on it seems disproportionate to me.

54:48.760 --> 54:50.760
Like, you return to this topic to cringe

54:50.760 --> 54:52.760
again and again and again

54:52.760 --> 54:54.760
and again and again and again. It's like you're

54:54.760 --> 54:56.760
picking at a wound. It feels to me

54:56.760 --> 54:58.760
like a morbid cringe obsession.

54:58.760 --> 55:00.760
And I guess I think I recognize

55:00.760 --> 55:02.760
part of myself in you. This could be

55:02.760 --> 55:04.760
me projecting, of course, but I

55:04.760 --> 55:06.760
wonder if the way you feel about

55:06.760 --> 55:08.760
girly, sparkle-gender AFABs

55:08.760 --> 55:10.760
is similar to the way I feel about

55:10.760 --> 55:12.760
otaku, transbian catgirls.

55:12.760 --> 55:14.760
And it might be worth considering

55:14.760 --> 55:16.760
that I don't cringe at the

55:16.760 --> 55:18.760
sparkle genders the way you do. I mean, I'm

55:18.760 --> 55:20.760
with you on wondering what a hey-they-zeer

55:20.760 --> 55:22.760
gender-flux lesbian demi-boy

55:22.760 --> 55:24.760
is. But unlike you, Calvin,

55:24.760 --> 55:26.760
I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession

55:26.760 --> 55:28.760
with feminine AFAB trans people.

55:28.760 --> 55:30.760
They can identify as however many genders

55:30.760 --> 55:32.760
they want for all I care. I may not always

55:32.760 --> 55:34.760
understand it, but I support

55:34.760 --> 55:36.760
their journey. I guess it doesn't bother

55:36.760 --> 55:38.760
me, because I'm not worried that anyone

55:38.760 --> 55:40.760
will judge me because of how they

55:40.760 --> 55:42.760
behave. I don't feel in-group cringe.

55:42.760 --> 55:44.760
Now it's a different story if I'm reading

55:44.760 --> 55:46.760
a general lesbian subreddit and I

55:46.760 --> 55:48.760
see a comment like,

55:48.760 --> 55:50.760
Pre-transition trans lesbian here.

55:50.760 --> 55:52.760
I wish I had titties. Girl,

55:52.760 --> 55:54.760
dick, nyah-nyah. Get the fuck out of here,

55:54.760 --> 55:56.760
Billy. You're giving real trans

55:56.760 --> 55:58.760
lesbians a bad name. This is why they

55:58.760 --> 56:00.760
hate us. See, now I

56:00.760 --> 56:02.760
have strong feelings. Now

56:02.760 --> 56:04.760
I'm in-group cringing. And intellectually,

56:04.760 --> 56:06.760
I do think my feelings are

56:06.760 --> 56:08.760
correct to some extent.

56:08.760 --> 56:10.760
Like, I don't think a general lesbian

56:10.760 --> 56:12.760
community is the appropriate

56:12.760 --> 56:14.760
forum for a trans woman who's

56:14.760 --> 56:16.760
effectively still living as a man

56:16.760 --> 56:18.760
to take the mic and whine about

56:18.760 --> 56:20.760
wanting titties or rhapsodize

56:20.760 --> 56:22.760
about girl dick. But I'm also

56:22.760 --> 56:24.760
aware that I feel this strongly

56:24.760 --> 56:26.760
about this because of my own

56:26.760 --> 56:28.760
dysphoria. And my own shame.

56:28.760 --> 56:30.760
And honestly, my own

56:30.760 --> 56:32.760
self-loathing. Like, I can't

56:32.760 --> 56:34.760
even talk to cis women on dating

56:34.760 --> 56:36.760
apps because I feel like a fake woman

56:36.760 --> 56:38.760
imposing myself on real women.

56:38.760 --> 56:40.760
That's where my head is at. So

56:40.760 --> 56:42.760
where does this pre-transition

56:42.760 --> 56:44.760
trans lesbian get the

56:44.760 --> 56:46.760
audacity? You know, it makes me feel in-group

56:46.760 --> 56:48.760
cringe about an identity,

56:48.760 --> 56:50.760
trans lesbianism, which for me

56:50.760 --> 56:52.760
is already a pain point of

56:52.760 --> 56:54.760
insecurity and embarrassment

56:54.760 --> 56:56.760
and shame. So Calvin, maybe

56:56.760 --> 56:58.760
and again, I could just be projecting,

56:58.760 --> 57:00.760
but maybe, that's

57:00.760 --> 57:02.760
kind of like how you feel about these trenders.

57:02.760 --> 57:04.760
When you make these videos condemning

57:04.760 --> 57:06.760
them as not really trans, aren't

57:06.760 --> 57:08.760
you essentially exiling them from

57:08.760 --> 57:10.760
the in-group so you no longer feel

57:10.760 --> 57:12.760
the pain of in-group cringe?

57:12.760 --> 57:14.760
Or perhaps, Calvin Guerra,

57:14.760 --> 57:16.760
what you're really trying

57:16.760 --> 57:18.760
to destroy is the trender

57:18.760 --> 57:20.760
within.

57:20.760 --> 57:22.760
And again, I could be

57:22.760 --> 57:24.760
full of shit here. At the end of the day,

57:24.760 --> 57:26.760
this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber

57:26.760 --> 57:28.760
I haven't met. So feel free

57:28.760 --> 57:30.760
to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin.

57:30.760 --> 57:32.760
But still, I guess I invite

57:32.760 --> 57:34.760
you to consider whether

57:34.760 --> 57:36.760
producing trans trender

57:36.760 --> 57:38.760
humilatainment is actually helping anything,

57:38.760 --> 57:40.760
or whether it's really

57:40.760 --> 57:42.760
just an addictive way to

57:42.760 --> 57:44.760
scratch some kind of emotional itch.

57:44.760 --> 57:46.760
Alright, I've said my piece about Calvin.

57:46.760 --> 57:48.760
Who's next?

57:48.760 --> 57:50.760
Oh, how about

57:50.760 --> 57:52.760
Vanessa. We meet again here.

57:52.760 --> 57:54.760
And once again, I'm wearing some

57:54.760 --> 57:56.760
kind of embarrassing anime hairpiece.

57:56.760 --> 57:58.760
Vanessa is a trans woman who

57:58.760 --> 58:00.760
is the second most popular

58:00.760 --> 58:02.760
political trans YouTuber.

58:02.760 --> 58:04.760
At least that's what I wrote in the script when I

58:04.760 --> 58:06.760
had more subscribers than her and was fully

58:06.760 --> 58:08.760
prepared to be a cunt about it, but

58:08.760 --> 58:10.760
since then, she has

58:10.760 --> 58:12.760
in fact surpassed me once again.

58:12.760 --> 58:14.760
Good for her. Vanessa started out as

58:14.760 --> 58:16.760
basically a cringe reaction channel

58:16.760 --> 58:18.760
back when SJW cringe was fashionable.

58:18.760 --> 58:20.760
She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,

58:20.760 --> 58:22.760
but the most consistent theme was

58:22.760 --> 58:24.760
trans trenders and crazy activists

58:24.760 --> 58:26.760
are giving real trans people a bad name.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.760
They're making us look bad.

58:28.760 --> 58:30.760
This is why people hate us.

58:30.760 --> 58:32.760
So what we can now recognize as a standard

58:32.760 --> 58:34.760
in-group cringe fixation.

58:34.760 --> 58:36.760
But Vanessa focused in particular

58:36.760 --> 58:38.760
on a strident

58:38.760 --> 58:40.760
SJW type trans woman

58:40.760 --> 58:42.760
called Riley Dennis.

58:42.760 --> 58:44.760
And Vanessa made several reaction

58:44.760 --> 58:46.760
videos to her where she made a point

58:46.760 --> 58:48.760
of misgendering Riley and

58:48.760 --> 58:50.760
dismissing her as a fake

58:50.760 --> 58:52.760
transgender who hadn't

58:52.760 --> 58:54.760
transitioned and clearly

58:54.760 --> 58:56.760
had no intention to.

58:56.760 --> 58:58.760
You know, if you went on estrogen,

58:58.760 --> 59:00.760
your sex drive wouldn't be so high and you

59:00.760 --> 59:02.760
wouldn't be guilt tripping people into having sex with you.

59:02.760 --> 59:04.760
Just saying.

59:04.760 --> 59:06.760
But then, Riley made a video

59:06.760 --> 59:08.760
revealing that she'd been on hormone therapy

59:08.760 --> 59:10.760
for a year and was about to

59:10.760 --> 59:12.760
undergo facial feminization surgery.

59:12.760 --> 59:14.760
This prompted Vanessa

59:14.760 --> 59:16.760
to make an apology video where she

59:16.760 --> 59:18.760
not only apologized to Riley

59:18.760 --> 59:20.760
and acknowledged her transition, but she

59:20.760 --> 59:22.760
actually went beyond the script of a

59:22.760 --> 59:24.760
generic oopsie doopsie YouTube video

59:24.760 --> 59:26.760
and opened up about having

59:26.760 --> 59:28.760
experienced herself the cruelty

59:28.760 --> 59:30.760
she directed at Riley.

59:30.760 --> 59:32.760
I'm someone who's had my transition

59:32.760 --> 59:34.760
picked apart online.

59:34.760 --> 59:36.760
There have been Reddit threads and 4chan

59:36.760 --> 59:38.760
threads with hundreds of comments on it

59:38.760 --> 59:40.760
of people trying to prove that I'm not trans

59:40.760 --> 59:42.760
because I haven't done this or that

59:42.760 --> 59:44.760
or, you know, digging up my old pictures

59:44.760 --> 59:46.760
and so the thought that this entire

59:46.760 --> 59:48.760
time I've done that exact

59:48.760 --> 59:50.760
same thing to someone else

59:50.760 --> 59:52.760
and pushed that off on someone else

59:52.760 --> 59:54.760
fucks with me.

59:54.760 --> 59:56.760
And I'm fucking sorry.

59:56.760 --> 59:58.760
Vanessa actually managed

59:58.760 --> 01:00:00.760
for one fleeting moment

01:00:00.760 --> 01:00:02.760
to make a connection between

01:00:02.760 --> 01:00:04.760
her own past hurt and trauma

01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:06.760
and the pain she'd inflicted on another

01:00:06.760 --> 01:00:08.760
person. Which is kind of a once in a lifetime

01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:10.760
event on a website

01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.760
where the performers are remorseless

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:14.760
psychopaths who wouldn't muddy their

01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:16.760
shoes to save a drowning child

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:18.760
and the viewers are cold blooded

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.760
sadists who consume human misery

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:22.760
like a glutton, gorging him

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.760
at a particularly

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:26.760
sumptuous buffet.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.760
You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.760
that I should really try to stick to

01:00:30.760 --> 01:00:32.760
ideas, opinions,

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:34.760
policy.

01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.760
However, this lesson would not last.

01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:38.760
Vanessa kept doing

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:40.760
SJW cringe content

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.760
well past the point it had become

01:00:42.760 --> 01:00:44.760
passÃ©, making a video with

01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:46.760
Big Red in the thumbnail

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:48.760
as recently as 2019.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.760
I admit, I thought she was

01:00:50.760 --> 01:00:52.760
fading into irrelevance.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.760
But again, I underestimated Vanessa.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.760
In July 2019,

01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.760
her channel rocketed to a new

01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.760
level of success when she released

01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:02.760
a video titled

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.760
Exposing Jessica Yaniv

01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:06.760
Trans Predator.

01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:08.760
In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.760
about a trans woman, or rather

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.760
she believes, a man posing

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:14.760
as a trans woman, called

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:16.760
Jessica Yaniv.

01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.760
Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?

01:01:18.760 --> 01:01:20.760
Well, as far as

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.760
I can tell, everything

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.760
Vanessa says about Yaniv

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:26.760
is true. Yaniv attempted

01:01:26.760 --> 01:01:28.760
to use a Canadian human rights

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:30.760
tribunal to close down several

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.760
beauty salons that had refused to wax

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.760
her hairy balls after she approached

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:36.760
them about it in an awkward and creepy

01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.760
way. She has a long history of sending

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.760
extremely inappropriate

01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:42.760
messages to underage girls.

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.760
And, she attempted to host

01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.760
a topless pool party

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.760
for unchaperoned children.

01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:50.760
Basically, Yaniv is someone who

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.760
appropriates the language of

01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.760
transgender acceptance and equality

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.760
to cloak predatory behavior

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:58.760
toward minors. And my read

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.760
on Yaniv, by the way, is not

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.760
that she's a cunning manipulator,

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.760
but that this is someone who is

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:06.760
mentally not playing

01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:08.760
with a full deck. After the success

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.760
of her initial video, Vanessa

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.760
made a few more videos about Yaniv

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.760
rebranding herself as a kind of

01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:16.760
transsexual Chris Hansen,

01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:18.760
exposing TRANSGENDER

01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.760
PREDATORS wherever

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.760
she could find them. And it

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:24.760
turns out, first, I was honestly

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.760
kind of loving this for Vanessa.

01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.760
At least now she's finally picking on

01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:30.760
someone who deserves it. But the more

01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.760
I think about it, the more

01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.760
hesitations I have. One,

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:36.760
is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv

01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.760
story and the lack of attention

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.760
given to it by other trans public

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.760
figures as an indictment of

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:44.760
trans activists.

01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:46.760
Who Vanessa thinks should spend more time

01:02:46.760 --> 01:02:48.760
sounding the alarm about

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:50.760
TRANSGENDER

01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:52.760
PREDATORS. And I'm willing to

01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:54.760
admit, there's probably

01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:56.760
a valid point in there somewhere.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.760
Like, some trans people really are

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.760
so paranoid about transphobes framing

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:02.760
all of us as dangerous perverts

01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:04.760
that they basically look the other

01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:06.760
way and refuse to acknowledge

01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:08.760
the small but real subset of trans

01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.760
people who are, in fact,

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.760
dangerous perverts. But Blair,

01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:14.760
you talk about the Yaniv

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:16.760
situation like it's urgent

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.760
breaking news. Like Yaniv should

01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:20.760
rightfully be a household name,

01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:22.760
but for the stubborn silence of trans

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.760
activists. But why?

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.760
Why should everyone be focused

01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:28.760
on Jessica Yaniv? There's more

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:30.760
than 100,000 sexual assaults

01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.760
reported to American law enforcement

01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:34.760
every year. The literal president of

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.760
America is a bit of a sexual

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:38.760
predator himself. Why

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.760
fixate on this one particular

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.760
Canadian creep? I guess you could

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.760
argue that since Yaniv is a

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.760
trans-identified predator,

01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:48.760
a tip. We as real trans

01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:50.760
people have a responsibility

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:52.760
to be the ones who lead the charge to stop

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:54.760
her. Or at least it would be good

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.760
optics for us to do that.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.760
And again, I think there's maybe some truth

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:00.760
to that, like initially

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:02.760
the LGBT website Pink News

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.760
straightforwardly reported Yaniv's

01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:06.760
claims of discrimination, which

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.760
is pretty embarrassing and

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.760
not great optics, but I don't think

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.760
that constantly broadcasting

01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.760
updates about the trans

01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.760
gender is really the best

01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.760
optics for us either. Why did

01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.760
Vanessa make this video in the first place?

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.760
Is it simply because she

01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:24.760
cares deeply about the well-being

01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:26.760
of children, and she

01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:28.760
thought making a video exposing

01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.760
Jessica Yaniv is the best

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.760
way to protect them?

01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:34.760
I mean, I'm sure she cares a little

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.760
bit about the children, but it's

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.760
still a YouTube video, and

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.760
you have to ask, is the

01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.760
primary intention here really

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.760
to stop a predator? Or

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.760
is it to manufacture

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:48.760
a sleazy entertainment

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.760
spectacle? Shortly after her

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:52.760
first Yaniv video was published,

01:04:52.760 --> 01:04:54.760
Vanessa hosted a live stream

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.760
on her channel titled

01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.760
Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.760
Trans Predator.

01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:02.760
This got 2 million views.

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:04.760
Is this what you do with

01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.760
someone you've just accused of

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:08.760
pedophilia? You host a live

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.760
event debating

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:12.760
the pedophile on your YouTube

01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.760
channel? What's to debate?

01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:16.760
I don't need to be scared in my own house

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.760
that I'm gonna get fucking attacked

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.760
which is illegal

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:22.760
in Canada, just saying. But

01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:24.760
you think that was, like, cute?

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.760
Was that a moment for you?

01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:30.760
Then of course, you sell t-shirts

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.760
featuring the meme that resulted

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.760
from your YouTube pedophile

01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:36.760
debate. I mean, that makes sense.

01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:38.760
If you're gonna catch a predator,

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.760
you gotta sell pedophile debate

01:05:40.760 --> 01:05:42.760
merch. And of course, you

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.760
gotta follow the pedophile's makeup

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.760
tutorial, you know,

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.760
for the children.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.760
Now, I hate to be overly

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.760
critical, but when I look

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:54.760
at this, I don't see

01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:56.760
a high-minded activist

01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.760
working to protect children and

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:00.760
trans people's image. I see

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.760
a tabloid entertainer

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.760
who's discovered a way to

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:06.760
monetize milking lulz

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:08.760
from a mentally defective

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.760
pervert. And I have to say,

01:06:10.760 --> 01:06:12.760
Blair, as a connoisseur of trash

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.760
myself, I'm very entertained

01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:16.760
by all of this. Following

01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.760
a sexual predator's makeup

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:20.760
tutorial? That's

01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:22.760
genius. I wish I'd

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:24.760
thought of that. But just be honest.

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.760
This isn't activism.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:28.760
This isn't justice.

01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.760
It's a lolcow cult.

01:06:30.760 --> 01:06:32.760
It's like one of Mari's transsexuals

01:06:32.760 --> 01:06:34.760
took over the show. And I love

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.760
that for her. I love that

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:38.760
for her. But Blair,

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:40.760
I can't help but notice

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.760
you're still hitting all the

01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:44.760
same beats your videos have always

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:46.760
hit. Attention, everyone.

01:06:46.760 --> 01:06:48.760
There is a bad

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.760
transgender in our midst.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.760
The bad transgender

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:54.760
is not a real transgender like

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:56.760
me. It's very important

01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.760
that we all gather round

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:00.760
to condemn this bad

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:02.760
transgender who is not a real

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:04.760
transgender. And Blair, I'll give you

01:07:04.760 --> 01:07:06.760
this. You are getting better at

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.760
choosing your targets. The transvestite

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:10.760
monster is a stock character in

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.760
our culture, and Jessica Yaniv

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.760
is good casting for the part.

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.760
She's a transphobe's boogeyman

01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.760
come to life, and I certainly

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.760
am not shedding any tears for her. But

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:22.760
you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.760
seriously as anything more than

01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:26.760
a smarter version of the same

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.760
in-group cringe humilitainment

01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:30.760
you've always made. And by the way,

01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:32.760
you may want to check in

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:34.760
on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:36.760
Rose of Dawn is another

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:38.760
conservative trans woman YouTuber

01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.760
who produces a series called Trans

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.760
Stupid. Hi, everyone, and

01:07:42.760 --> 01:07:44.760
welcome to another edition of Trans

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.760
Stupid, the show where I take a look at the

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.760
wonderful world of LGBTQIA++

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:50.760
news because

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:52.760
stupidity is intersectional.

01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:54.760
Transgender.

01:07:54.760 --> 01:07:56.760
More like trans

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.760
retarded. More like trans

01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:00.760
gay.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.760
Trans gay.

01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:04.760
I love that. I'm literally, I just

01:08:04.760 --> 01:08:06.760
realized I'm literally trans gay. Rose's

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:08.760
channel is allegedly about the

01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:10.760
excesses of trans ideology

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.760
and activism, which in theory

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:14.760
I do think is a perspective

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:16.760
worth including in the conversation.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.760
But in practice,

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:20.760
well, let's just say Rose

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:22.760
has produced a 30-minute documentary

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.760
about why Chris Chan is not

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.760
a real transgender. There is a

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.760
bad transgender in our

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.760
midst. The bad transgender

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.760
is not a real transgender

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.760
like me. I'm getting pretty tired

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:36.760
of this. And here's her transition advice

01:08:36.760 --> 01:08:38.760
to trans women just beginning their

01:08:38.760 --> 01:08:40.760
journey. You probably have this image in your

01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.760
head that, you know, you're going to be this really

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:44.760
cute-looking trans

01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.760
woman. Like, effectively, you're going to be this

01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:48.760
seal. Like, look at this seal.

01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.760
Isn't this seal adorable?

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.760
You're so cute. But

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.760
the truth is, you're probably not

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.760
looking like this seal right now, are you?

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.760
You're probably more like this big

01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.760
bull seal, barging your

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:02.760
way into women's bathrooms

01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.760
saying, this is a woman's

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.760
body. Now,

01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:08.760
you might never reach the

01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:10.760
cute seal phase. In fact,

01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.760
very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:14.760
Rose, no.

01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.760
Do not simp for Vanessa.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.760
It only encourages her. She's also

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:20.760
made no less than 20

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.760
videos about Jessica Yaniv.

01:09:22.760 --> 01:09:24.760
Which seems like kind of a lot,

01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:26.760
Gorge. Would I be wrong to say I'm

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.760
getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.760
vibe? In these videos, Rose

01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.760
chronicles Yaniv's numerous crimes and

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.760
wrongdoings, but she also

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.760
cannot resist making it

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.760
very clear how disgusted

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:40.760
she is with Yaniv's

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.760
appearance. The irony being

01:09:42.760 --> 01:09:44.760
that this kind of tweet came from someone who you

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.760
could smell just by looking at

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.760
a picture of them. I bring this up,

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:50.760
again, not because I have

01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:52.760
any interest at all in white knighting

01:09:52.760 --> 01:09:54.760
for Yaniv. I do not support

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.760
her journey. As far as I'm concerned,

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.760
she can eat shit. And maybe

01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:00.760
she does. I wouldn't be surprised.

01:10:00.760 --> 01:10:02.760
No, my point is that part of the

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.760
catharsis that Rose and Vanessa

01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.760
seem to derive from making

01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.760
this kind of content

01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.760
comes from contrasting themselves

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:12.760
as good, presentable,

01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:14.760
real trans people with

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.760
the hideousness of the wretched

01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:18.760
fake trans dump

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.760
truck. A classic Vanessa

01:10:20.760 --> 01:10:22.760
thumbnail is divided

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.760
into two halves. On

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.760
one half, Vanessa

01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:28.760
looking fish, looking

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:30.760
cunt.

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.760
Always with her lip gloss in the livestreams.

01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.760
And in the other half of the

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.760
thumbnail, for contrast,

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:42.760
the tragic dump truck

01:10:42.760 --> 01:10:44.760
in a maladjusted wig.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.760
And I'm allowed to say dump truck because before

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.760
I transitioned, I was one of Vanessa's

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.760
dump trucks. I was one of

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:52.760
her dump trucks.

01:10:52.760 --> 01:10:54.760
Look, I happen to

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:56.760
possess a little thing

01:10:56.760 --> 01:10:58.760
you probably haven't heard of it, called

01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:00.760
inner beauty. That's right, sweetie.

01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:02.760
My pancreas?

01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.760
Unclockable.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:06.760
Meanwhile, Rose,

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:08.760
who prefers to represent herself

01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:10.760
with this cartoon,

01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:12.760
okay, straight up

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.760
refers to Yaniv as

01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.760
the tubby troon in the Titanic

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.760
Tranner of Canada.

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:20.760
A particular Titanic Tranner of Canada?

01:11:20.760 --> 01:11:22.760
Tranner and

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.760
troon being pejoratives for

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:26.760
transgender that I associate

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.760
with 4chan, where I'm guessing

01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.760
Rose has spent a lot of time.

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.760
As for the emphatic revulsion

01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.760
toward Yaniv's fatness, well,

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.760
I'm guessing that must be another

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:40.760
important part of stopping a predator, right?

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:42.760
It seems almost

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.760
taboo to condemn people

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.760
for how rough they look, when

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.760
I think that that tough love in a

01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:50.760
way is needed, because

01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:52.760
I look at what I looked like when I

01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.760
first transitioned, and

01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.760
Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.760
Like, I looked

01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:00.760
bad. Like, I was overweight,

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.760
I had a poor taste

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.760
in clothes. Like, I was

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.760
never wearing stupid dresses or anything,

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:08.760
it was mostly t-shirts and jeans.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.760
You're probably more like this big bullseed

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.760
barging your way into

01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:14.760
women's bathrooms, saying

01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.760
this is a woman's body.

01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.760
Now, you might

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.760
never reach me. You'd see

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:22.760
me fake, so in fact, very few of us

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.760
turn out to look like Claire White. And I want to make

01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:26.760
it very clear that when I'm talking about

01:12:26.760 --> 01:12:28.760
transition, I don't mean that

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:30.760
you're going to- Rose...

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.760
Are you okay? No.

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.760
You're not okay. None of us are okay.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.760
No trans woman, remotely

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:38.760
in the public eye, is in any way

01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:40.760
okay. And look, I don't want to take

01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:42.760
this psychoanalysis too far, because

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.760
I don't know, from watching YouTube

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:46.760
videos, what's going on in someone's head.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.760
But I can try to make intelligent inferences,

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.760
and I think it's pretty revealing

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.760
that this is how Rose

01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.760
introduces the topic of Jessica

01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:56.760
Yaniv. Being, well, one of the

01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.760
biggest characters in the

01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:00.760
whole fucking world at the moment,

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:02.760
which is Jessica Yaniv.

01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:04.760
Rose?

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:06.760
Gorge?

01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.760
Jessica Yaniv is not one of

01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:10.760
the biggest characters

01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.760
in the whole world

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.760
at any moment. This is not

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:16.760
a world historical figure.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.760
At the end of the day, this is a more or less

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:20.760
random civilian sex fiend off

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:22.760
the streets of Vancouver, BC.

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:24.760
The only reason anyone has heard of her at all

01:13:24.760 --> 01:13:26.760
is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch

01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:28.760
a predator and turn this grimy

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.760
reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.

01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:32.760
She is not one of the most important

01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:34.760
characters in the world. But it sounds

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.760
like what she is, Rose, is

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.760
one of the most important characters

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:40.760
in your brain. This is distorted thinking.

01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.760
It's like A-Log comparing

01:13:42.760 --> 01:13:44.760
Chris Chan to Hitler. You're so deep

01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.760
in the morbid cringe obsession that

01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:48.760
you've lost perspective. And I'm sure

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.760
you have what seem to you like perfectly

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.760
logical reasons why you're devoting so much

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760
attention to this. And I know videos

01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:56.760
about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I'm

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:58.760
sure that's a factor too. But Rose,

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.760
I also know a morbid cringe obsession

01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:02.760
when I see one. And I know

01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:04.760
that being a visible trans woman on the

01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:06.760
internet is more difficult than most

01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:08.760
people can imagine. And I know

01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:10.760
that pretty much every trans person is

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.760
bullied or shamed or humiliated

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.760
at some point in our lives. And I know

01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.760
how good it can feel to

01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:18.760
take all the horrible things transphobic

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:20.760
noobs and bullies and TERFs have said about

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:22.760
us, and repeat them

01:14:22.760 --> 01:14:24.760
verbatim about some

01:14:24.760 --> 01:14:26.760
big, fat, fake,

01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.760
dangerous, delusional, disgusting

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:30.760
male fetishist. Oh,

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:32.760
it feels good to be the TERF for

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.760
once. It feels good to be the

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:36.760
judge rather than the judged.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.760
Because when you point the finger at someone else,

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.760
you're also pointing away

01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.760
from yourself. And it's not

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:44.760
lost on me that in conservative circles,

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.760
queer people are often treated like

01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:48.760
suspected sex criminals by default.

01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.760
So there's safety in being the

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.760
one who spearheads the think of the children

01:14:52.760 --> 01:14:54.760
type moral crusade. And when

01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:56.760
you expose a trans predator,

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.760
you get that feeling of

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.760
safety plus the relief

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.760
of having someone in particular

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.760
to blame for the shame

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.760
and stigma we all feel.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.760
Jessica Yaniv is the reason

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.760
people hate us. But that's just not true.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.760
It's a simple answer to a

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:14.760
complicated problem. It's scapegoating.

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.760
When I look at the Yaniv

01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.760
obsession on trans YouTube,

01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:20.760
I see a community trying

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:22.760
to cope with stigma and

01:15:22.760 --> 01:15:24.760
hoping that destroying a scapegoat

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:26.760
will bring relief. It's basically

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.760
a blood sacrifice.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.760
It's not rational. It feels

01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.760
good for a moment,

01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.760
but it's an addiction. It won't ever

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:36.760
erase the stigma and the shame.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.760
And Yaniv is simply the latest

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:40.760
and most deserving in a

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.760
long line of bad

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:44.760
transgenders who aren't real transgenders

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.760
and are giving us a bad name

01:15:46.760 --> 01:15:48.760
and are the reason people hate us and

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.760
want us to be condemned and destroyed.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.760
But when Yaniv is finally gone,

01:15:52.760 --> 01:15:54.760
when you get her sent to prison or whatever your

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:56.760
goal is, you're just gonna find a new

01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.760
scapegoat to take her place.

01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:00.760
And the shame cycle continues.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.760
The humiliation and bullying we've experienced

01:16:02.760 --> 01:16:04.760
is internalized as shame.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.760
When we project that shame onto

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:08.760
scapegoats and onto each other,

01:16:08.760 --> 01:16:10.760
it becomes cringing and contempt.

01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:12.760
And we voice that contempt

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:14.760
by shaming other people,

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.760
which starts a new cycle.

01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:18.760
So you can keep finding new scapegoats,

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.760
new punching bags, new shame dumps,

01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.760
new lolcows, and you can end up like

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:24.760
one of the people who's been archiving

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.760
Chris Chan for 13 years.

01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:28.760
But that will never really heal us.

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:30.760
God, how do I get out of this video?

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.760
I'm trying to have a serious conversation

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.760
dressed as some sort of catgirl degenerate.

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.760
Cringe. Shame.

01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:38.760
I'm ashamed. Don't look at me.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:40.760
You know,

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:42.760
I love wearing florals in front of flowers.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:44.760
Thank you, yes.

01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.760
I suppose it is groundbreaking.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.760
Alright children, let's review our notes

01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:50.760
on cringe. The word cringe really describes

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.760
two different emotions,

01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:54.760
either embarrassment or contempt.

01:16:54.760 --> 01:16:56.760
You can feel either one for yourself

01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.760
or for someone else. When you're embarrassed

01:16:58.760 --> 01:17:00.760
for someone else, we call that vicarious

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.760
embarrassment. And that can mean cringing

01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.760
with someone who is embarrassed themselves,

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.760
which I've argued is excluded

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.760
in the internet usage of the word cringe.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.760
Or it can mean embarrassment for someone

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.760
who isn't embarrassed themselves,

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:14.760
in which case we say we're cringing at them.

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:16.760
Now if someone who's part of your

01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:18.760
in-group is embarrassing themselves,

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.760
by proxy, embarrassing the in-group

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.760
that includes you, you feel

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.760
in-group cringe, which can involve

01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:26.760
both vicarious embarrassment

01:17:26.760 --> 01:17:28.760
and a kind of self-cringe.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.760
And on the contempt side, contempt

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.760
for someone who shares traits in common with

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.760
you, particularly if they're traits you have

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:36.760
contempt for in yourself, can

01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:38.760
develop into morbid cringe,

01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.760
which is that obsession with a lol cow,

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.760
that addiction to contemptuous

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:44.760
gazing at a dark mirror in which

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:46.760
you see reflected everything you hate about

01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:48.760
yourself or about your in-group.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:50.760
Now I want to end this video by reflecting

01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:52.760
on whether cringe is good or bad,

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.760
healthy or harmful.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.760
And I do think that in some situations,

01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:58.760
cringe is good.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:00.760
Embarrassment serves a social purpose.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.760
It helps us interact smoothly with each other

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:04.760
by telling us what not to do.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:06.760
And empathizing with other people's embarrassing

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.760
stories can be cathartic.

01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:10.760
It can make you feel closer to other people,

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.760
more alike, less alone.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:14.760
I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe

01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:16.760
is very healthy. It shows you're

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.760
self-aware, and you care at least

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:20.760
a little bit what other people think.

01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:22.760
You know, I've met people who never cringe

01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:24.760
at themselves, and let's just say

01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.760
they're not my kind of people.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.760
They're narcissists who think super highly

01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:30.760
of themselves, regardless of how they're

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:32.760
actually coming across. But I think partly

01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:34.760
out of fear of ending up like one of those

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.760
people, I've overcompensated.

01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:38.760
And I cringe too much.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:40.760
Both at myself, and at other people.

01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:42.760
It's a habit that's kind of

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.760
making me hate myself, and it's making

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:46.760
me unfairly contemptuous towards

01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.760
others. And when I take a look around the

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:50.760
internet, like I've done in this video,

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.760
I find that I'm not

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.760
alone in this situation. And it's

01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.760
not cute. So, how do we

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:58.760
cringe less? Well, the cliche solution

01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:00.760
is self-love, which our culture

01:19:00.760 --> 01:19:02.760
places a lot of value on.

01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:04.760
Self-love and self-esteem.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.760
You know, I don't care what haters

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.760
and losers say. I'm a bad bitch.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.760
I look like a supermodel.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:12.760
I'm a genius.

01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:14.760
We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way.

01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:16.760
But it doesn't work, because it's not

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.760
realistic. You don't look like a supermodel.

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:20.760
And you're not a genius.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.760
And when you realize that, you fall from one

01:19:22.760 --> 01:19:24.760
extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:26.760
the self-esteem tower of terror.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.760
You go from self-love to self-hate.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:30.760
But self-hate is also

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.760
a distortion. Recently I was listening to

01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:34.760
a David Foster Wallace interview.

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:36.760
Yeah, I know. Cringe. And he attacked

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.760
me mercilessly and unprovoked.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:40.760
There's a lot of narcissism and self-hatred.

01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.760
How

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:44.760
dare you notice that? I'm in this

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:46.760
photo and I don't like it.

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.760
But it's true! Time spent

01:19:48.760 --> 01:19:50.760
cringing at yourself is still

01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:52.760
time spent obsessing over yourself.

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:54.760
And it's hard not to, because

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.760
humans are animals, so our

01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.760
perspective is egocentric by nature.

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:00.760
But we can still learn to appreciate

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.760
that the world is bigger

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.760
than us. I mean, I've heard rumors.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:06.760
In that book we started with, Cringeworthy,

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.760
Melissa Doll advocates not

01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:10.760
self-love or self-hate, but what

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:12.760
she calls self-indifference.

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.760
She says,

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:16.760
Self-indifference is the relief

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:18.760
of realizing that you are simply

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.760
not that big a deal.

01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.760
So yeah, I was pretty

01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:24.760
cringey in the past, and

01:20:24.760 --> 01:20:26.760
I'm still pretty cringey now, but

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.760
you know what? Everyone else

01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.760
is pretty cringey too. And the world's

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.760
probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway,

01:20:32.760 --> 01:20:34.760
so I don't know if I would call this

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.760
good news, but if it's

01:20:36.760 --> 01:20:38.760
any consolation, uh,

01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.760
nothing matters.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:48.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:50.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:50.760 --> 01:20:52.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:54.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:56.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.760
Nothing matters.

01:20:58.760 --> 01:21:00.760
Nothing matters.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.760
Nothing matters.

01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:46.740
Thank you for watching.

01:21:46.760 --> 01:22:16.740
Thank you for watching.

01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:46.740
Thank you.

01:22:46.760 --> 01:23:16.740
Thank you.

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.480
Thank you.
