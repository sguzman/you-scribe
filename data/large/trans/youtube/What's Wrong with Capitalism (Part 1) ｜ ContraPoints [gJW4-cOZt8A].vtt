00:00.000 --> 00:07.600
When you look into the pools of the 9-11 memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask

00:07.600 --> 00:09.400
yourself questions.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.360
Why is the world bad?

00:11.360 --> 00:13.600
What did all these people die for?

00:13.600 --> 00:16.660
Well, for freedom, I guess.

00:16.660 --> 00:19.640
And like, American values?

00:19.640 --> 00:21.260
But what are those values?

00:21.260 --> 00:24.920
What kind of freedom is it that we have?

00:24.920 --> 00:29.960
The 9-11 memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.

00:29.960 --> 00:35.600
There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want,

00:35.600 --> 00:39.640
but they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels

00:39.640 --> 00:40.640
anyway.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.640
Ugh.

00:41.640 --> 00:47.960
Fuckin' neoliberalism?

00:47.960 --> 00:50.080
What even goes on in these big buildings?

00:50.080 --> 00:53.400
I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.

00:53.400 --> 00:59.120
Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather, drinking human blood, licking whipped

00:59.120 --> 00:59.940
cream off the ends?

00:59.940 --> 01:03.700
Are these the interns?

01:03.700 --> 01:06.000
What the hell even is this country?

01:06.000 --> 01:09.820
Just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place.

01:09.820 --> 01:16.900
Longhorn Steakhouse, Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, PetSmart, Chipotle, Fridays,

01:16.900 --> 01:17.900
Dave & Buster's.

01:17.900 --> 01:24.620
I guess it's not so bad, as long as you kick things up a notch.

01:24.620 --> 01:29.620
Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order.

01:29.620 --> 01:30.300
Dominoes?

01:30.300 --> 01:32.380
Of course I want the fucking lava cakes.

01:32.380 --> 01:36.380
I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza.

01:36.380 --> 01:37.380
Put it all in me.

01:37.380 --> 01:38.380
Fill me up.

01:38.380 --> 01:39.380
Oh, goddammit.

01:39.380 --> 01:46.380
It was so good, but I ate so much I think I'm gonna die.

01:46.380 --> 01:50.380
Look what capitalism made me do.

01:50.380 --> 01:57.380
...control of vast parts of territory all across the Middle East.

01:57.380 --> 01:58.380
State foot number...

01:58.380 --> 01:58.780
...state foot number...

01:58.780 --> 01:59.300
State foot number...

01:59.300 --> 02:00.540
State foot number...

02:00.540 --> 02:01.520
State foot number...

02:01.520 --> 02:01.920
...ами.

02:01.920 --> 02:02.480
State foot number...

02:02.480 --> 02:03.000
State foot number...

02:03.000 --> 02:06.500
State foot number...

02:06.500 --> 02:07.900
State foot number...

02:07.900 --> 02:08.520
State foot number...

02:08.520 --> 02:09.020
...amy.

02:09.020 --> 02:09.380
...ami.

02:09.380 --> 02:09.980
State foot number...

02:09.980 --> 02:10.340
State foot number...

02:10.340 --> 02:11.260
State foot number...

02:11.260 --> 02:17.760
State foot number...

02:17.760 --> 02:18.140
...amy.

02:18.140 --> 02:18.260
State foot number...

02:18.260 --> 02:20.180
State foot number...

02:20.180 --> 02:22.980
State foot number...

02:22.980 --> 02:27.180
State foot number...

02:27.180 --> 02:28.040
State foot number...

02:28.040 --> 02:28.340
State foot number...

02:28.340 --> 02:32.880
slur against queer teenagers, but it comes from the movie Fight Club, where it refers

02:32.880 --> 02:37.240
to a generation of white guys who have become adults only to find that they're worse off

02:37.240 --> 02:42.280
than their fathers, that they don't have glamorous jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and, more

02:42.280 --> 02:46.300
recently, that even in the escapist world of video games their absolute sovereignty

02:46.300 --> 02:47.300
is being challenged.

02:47.300 --> 02:54.140
I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.

02:54.140 --> 03:00.020
Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic

03:00.020 --> 03:01.020
homeland.

03:01.020 --> 03:04.780
But till now I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to

03:04.780 --> 03:09.980
do that because, the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing

03:09.980 --> 03:14.300
them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.

03:14.300 --> 03:18.700
So the masculinist alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.

03:18.700 --> 03:23.200
Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy

03:23.200 --> 03:24.140
cucks.

03:24.140 --> 03:28.420
Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid Ikea consumers.

03:28.420 --> 03:29.420
Capitalism did.

03:29.420 --> 03:33.740
So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people and

03:33.740 --> 03:38.980
unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking goddamn

03:38.980 --> 03:49.580
reptiles.

03:49.580 --> 03:50.580
Chapter One.

03:50.580 --> 03:51.580
Capitalism and Spirit.

03:51.580 --> 03:52.920
Oh god, I sound like a philosopher.

03:52.920 --> 03:53.920
Someone shut up.

03:54.140 --> 03:55.140
Don't shoot me.

03:55.140 --> 03:59.840
Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on

03:59.840 --> 04:03.200
freedom is just another place to go shopping?

04:03.200 --> 04:05.460
A leftist could easily have said that.

04:05.460 --> 04:09.640
We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension

04:09.640 --> 04:10.640
to it too.

04:10.640 --> 04:14.380
Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human soul

04:14.380 --> 04:19.140
under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer who appropriates

04:19.140 --> 04:23.180
the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment of inanimate

04:23.180 --> 04:23.980
objects with transcendence.

04:23.980 --> 04:30.940
With the system of lies and delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself,

04:30.940 --> 04:35.280
with fucking Comcast increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.

04:35.280 --> 04:37.280
No, I don't want a landline.

04:37.280 --> 04:38.980
No one under the age of 60 wants a landline.

04:38.980 --> 04:42.880
Of course, it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise.

04:42.880 --> 04:47.420
Fascists and conservatives notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective

04:47.420 --> 04:50.980
meeting in ancient customs, racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.

04:50.980 --> 04:52.980
And that shit's not really my scene.

04:52.980 --> 04:58.040
I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person, but I think that capitalism

04:58.040 --> 05:01.840
as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.

05:01.840 --> 05:03.240
And here's why.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.240
Chapter 2.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.240
Alienated labor.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.480
Ugh, this Marxist jargon sucks.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.000
Let's come up with something new.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.060
Chapter 2.

05:10.060 --> 05:11.060
Shitty jobs.

05:11.060 --> 05:12.860
Why is your job so shitty?

05:12.860 --> 05:17.260
Well, probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center, and

05:17.260 --> 05:21.020
you spend your day dealing with whiny, entitled white bitches who don't understand that you're

05:21.020 --> 05:22.980
just a lackey without any actual power.

05:22.980 --> 05:26.860
And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout

05:26.860 --> 05:27.860
at each other.

05:27.860 --> 05:31.380
You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really

05:31.380 --> 05:35.200
have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are

05:35.200 --> 05:36.200
a gear.

05:36.200 --> 05:41.320
The CEO makes $36 million a year, while you make $14 an hour, which means that a lot of

05:41.320 --> 05:45.260
the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight up the

05:45.260 --> 05:48.560
chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.

05:48.560 --> 05:52.060
The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against

05:52.060 --> 05:55.940
your fellow employees for a promotion, or even to not be laid off.

05:55.940 --> 05:59.820
And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another

05:59.820 --> 06:05.980
shitty job as a concrete lifter, or a mud mule, or maybe even a coffee shop MacBook

06:05.980 --> 06:06.980
person.

06:06.980 --> 06:10.580
This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your

06:10.580 --> 06:15.340
shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.

06:15.340 --> 06:20.560
And it gets even worse, you could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate

06:20.560 --> 06:21.940
in team building exercises.

06:21.940 --> 06:27.220
Companies scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not only do you have a shitty

06:27.220 --> 06:31.720
oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure of openly hating your life.

06:31.720 --> 06:35.600
You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining

06:35.600 --> 06:38.980
the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.

06:38.980 --> 06:42.780
These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.

06:42.780 --> 06:46.740
If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.860
They'll call you an independent contractor.

06:48.860 --> 06:49.860
I'm sorry.

06:49.860 --> 06:50.860
I'm sorry.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.060
I'm sorry.

06:52.060 --> 06:54.640
You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.

06:54.640 --> 06:59.100
You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the

06:59.100 --> 07:04.420
cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,

07:04.420 --> 07:05.920
paid leave, or pension.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.100
So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?

07:09.100 --> 07:13.080
No, please don't transfer me to the billing department, they already transferred me here.

07:13.080 --> 07:14.080
Chapter 3.

07:14.080 --> 07:15.080
Advertising.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.100
Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?

07:18.100 --> 07:20.860
What if each section is named after an episode in the Odyssey?

07:20.860 --> 07:24.780
If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from

07:24.780 --> 07:31.300
all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals, and cigarettes, and sugar snacks,

07:31.300 --> 07:33.480
and now you can't get no satisfaction.

07:33.480 --> 07:37.320
Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like

07:37.320 --> 07:39.420
a basic feature of the human condition.

07:39.420 --> 07:43.500
But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to

07:43.500 --> 07:44.500
life under capitalism.

07:44.500 --> 07:48.940
I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered

07:48.940 --> 07:50.060
up with advertisements for- oh.

07:50.060 --> 07:50.260
Oh.

07:50.260 --> 07:52.220
Oh.

07:52.220 --> 07:53.220
So many fans.

07:53.220 --> 07:55.620
Contrapoints is a tankie confirmed.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.640
A neoliberal tankie.

07:57.640 --> 08:02.400
The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend

08:02.400 --> 08:05.120
nearly $500 billion a year doing.

08:05.120 --> 08:09.260
The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the

08:09.260 --> 08:14.240
fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals

08:14.240 --> 08:17.700
making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.

08:17.700 --> 08:20.180
Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not-

08:20.180 --> 08:25.440
very rational, for instance. Randomly correlating the product with sexual desire. Generating new

08:25.440 --> 08:29.620
insecurities the product promises to alleviate. Associating the product with social status.

08:29.760 --> 08:34.320
Associating the product with random famous people. Associating the product with degenerate decadence.

08:34.420 --> 08:37.920
Associating the product with progressive social movements. Associating the product

08:37.920 --> 08:42.660
with communist revolutions. Gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors.

08:42.660 --> 08:48.640
Join the clone army. Completely original lighting. Gay orgies. Love cannot survive

08:48.640 --> 08:53.980
without diamonds. Is this rational? Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best

08:53.980 --> 08:58.860
interests? Of course not. The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that

08:58.860 --> 09:04.000
people have. It's to endlessly create new needs. And that's a lot to keep up with and it takes a

09:04.000 --> 09:09.240
lot of stamina. Which is why it's a good thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus. Every evening before

09:09.240 --> 09:14.700
I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories for a sustainable

09:14.700 --> 09:18.620
blast in power. With all natural ginseng and opium extracts,

09:18.640 --> 09:25.760
Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria and indifference to paint that I need to get it in.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.640
I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple ammels, then I take

09:30.640 --> 09:38.600
my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open. Vitalimax. For bottoms.

09:38.600 --> 09:42.880
Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires which they implant in your

09:42.880 --> 09:47.260
brain through advertising. Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that

09:47.260 --> 09:48.480
they invented.

09:48.480 --> 09:58.020
So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human

09:58.020 --> 10:03.140
happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to want and

10:03.140 --> 10:07.440
then sell it to you. And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's

10:07.440 --> 10:12.000
especially egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met. On the one hand,

10:12.220 --> 10:17.040
we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt, spiraling tuition costs leading

10:17.040 --> 10:18.460
college students to take out loans, and we have a society built not around meeting basic human needs,

10:18.480 --> 10:18.980
but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to want and then sell it to you.

10:18.980 --> 10:24.560
They may never escape, more than half a million homeless people, and 13 million children who have to go to school hungry.

10:24.560 --> 10:29.940
And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass produce $400 juice packet

10:29.940 --> 10:35.020
squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes, and there are apparently Americans who are

10:35.020 --> 10:40.060
willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings. I mean it's a fine painting, it's

10:40.060 --> 10:45.100
got a lot of great red on it, but is it really worth the cost of feeding every homeless person

10:45.100 --> 10:46.880
in America for two weeks?

10:46.880 --> 10:47.320
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

10:47.320 --> 10:47.820
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

10:47.820 --> 10:48.320
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

10:48.320 --> 10:48.440
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

10:48.440 --> 10:49.480
Is this what an efficient economy looks like?

10:49.480 --> 10:54.120
If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe, but shouldn't the economy serve

10:54.120 --> 10:56.040
humanity rather than the other way around?

10:56.040 --> 11:00.120
If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,

11:00.120 --> 11:05.080
and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden donuts we can produce?

11:05.080 --> 11:13.320
No cuts to Medicaid! Save our liberty!

11:13.320 --> 11:15.080
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

11:15.080 --> 11:17.720
Canto 4, message to the rich.

11:17.720 --> 11:18.280
All right you

11:18.280 --> 11:20.760
filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up.

11:20.760 --> 11:25.080
I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics. I mean,

11:25.080 --> 11:28.920
I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little significance

11:28.920 --> 11:32.280
to that as you choose. But what I'm picking up at the moment is that people are getting

11:32.280 --> 11:36.200
fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.

11:36.200 --> 11:40.680
And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here. Recent polling data shows that a majority

11:40.680 --> 11:46.040
of adults under the age of 30 do not support capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.120
This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to be a rich person if you don't support capitalism.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.560
You can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of the country is underemployed,

11:51.560 --> 11:53.720
in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.

11:53.720 --> 11:57.640
What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well. You can't just

11:57.640 --> 12:02.280
stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this, when there are millions

12:02.280 --> 12:06.520
of peasants who don't have enough to eat. They will eventually try to cut your heads off.

12:06.520 --> 12:09.240
And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now,

12:09.240 --> 12:13.240
if you don't fix some shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking

12:13.240 --> 12:17.480
heads off. I mean, they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to

12:17.480 --> 12:22.360
deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole thing,

12:23.000 --> 12:26.440
bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.

12:26.440 --> 12:30.680
Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.

12:30.680 --> 12:35.080
The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going. Something is gonna have to change,

12:35.080 --> 12:39.000
and we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. The choice is up to you.

12:45.720 --> 12:46.120
Well?

12:46.760 --> 12:47.400
Are you going?

12:47.480 --> 12:48.760
To answer the phone?

12:50.200 --> 12:54.760
There is no phone. There is only the sigh of the oppressed creature.

12:55.560 --> 13:00.920
The heart of a heartless world. The soul of a soulless condition.

13:01.880 --> 13:03.800
It's best to just try and ignore it.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.040
Episode 5, Message to the Youth.

13:10.040 --> 13:14.040
Alright kids, so you're angry. Well, good. The world sucks.

13:14.040 --> 13:16.760
There's a lot to be angry about. What we have to do next,

13:16.760 --> 13:21.240
is decide what to do with that anger. I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.

13:21.240 --> 13:22.440
So, what do we do?

13:24.120 --> 13:25.240
Smash?

13:25.240 --> 13:27.080
Tabby, get in here. Sit down.

13:29.400 --> 13:33.240
Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you. Harsh words have been exchanged.

13:33.240 --> 13:37.560
But I need young radicals like you in my life. The minute I stop listening to people like you,

13:37.560 --> 13:41.800
is the minute I become irrelevant. So I apologize. I never meant to hurt you.

13:42.520 --> 13:43.560
Baby, I'm sorry.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.680
I mean look, I get it. Smashing is fun.

13:47.080 --> 13:49.640
But we also need to have a real plan. That's all I'm saying.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.000
So what's the plan?

13:51.800 --> 13:52.840
Revolution.

13:52.840 --> 13:59.160
Okay, yeah, revolution. I mean, you're right. Donald Trump is president. Fuck it. Revolution.

13:59.160 --> 14:03.880
We've gotta get better people in office. We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?

14:03.880 --> 14:05.080
No, revolution.

14:06.040 --> 14:08.920
Yes, I know, revolution. But what kind of revolution? Like,

14:08.920 --> 14:13.640
Project Mayhem? Gather your muskets, ye militiamen, and water the Tree of Liberty? What?

14:13.640 --> 14:15.560
No, I mean direct action.

14:15.560 --> 14:16.600
Okay, so like,

14:16.680 --> 14:17.880
a general strike?

14:17.880 --> 14:19.320
No, end capitalism.

14:25.720 --> 14:29.000
Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here, because I really don't,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.640
but I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more

14:31.640 --> 14:37.000
substantive than just saying the word revolution. Like, I'm in support of radical movements.

14:37.000 --> 14:42.440
Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings, I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot of energy,

14:42.440 --> 14:46.600
they shift the Overton window to the left, and they can have a big cultural impact. But none of them

14:46.600 --> 14:52.120
so far has ended capitalism. And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power, and we can change

14:52.120 --> 14:56.520
the state through electoral politics, so why not direct some serious energy toward that?

14:56.520 --> 15:00.920
Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China, but no elected politician has

15:00.920 --> 15:05.960
ever even come close to ending capitalism in the US, so why do you think that will work?

15:05.960 --> 15:09.560
What's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt,

15:09.560 --> 15:13.560
finance-backed system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to?

15:13.560 --> 15:16.440
Well, you're not entirely wrong. But on the other hand, Chinese,

15:16.440 --> 15:20.840
and Soviet communism were not exactly super great, and in any case, I'm having a little bit

15:20.840 --> 15:27.320
of trouble imagining a 1917-style revolutionary army marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.

15:27.320 --> 15:31.880
Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion, and getting affordable healthcare and education,

15:31.880 --> 15:37.320
and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals? What if the 2020 election is postponed?

15:37.320 --> 15:41.640
Well, then I will transition into you and become you unironically. Why not just be honest about

15:41.640 --> 15:45.720
your political stance? Are you a democratic socialist, or would you actually support a

15:45.720 --> 15:46.280
revolution?

15:46.440 --> 15:50.280
Well, I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.

15:50.280 --> 15:54.200
Now, for you, Contrapoints, I mean, you're still a heretic and an enemy of the

15:54.200 --> 15:58.120
Imperium and you are a demonette of Slanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.

16:00.920 --> 16:03.000
Well, what exactly are your positions?

16:03.000 --> 16:04.120
Um, well...

16:05.160 --> 16:11.800
Kill everyone now! Condone first-degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit!

16:11.800 --> 16:15.960
Filth are my politics? Eat reptiles?

16:15.960 --> 16:18.920
Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?

16:18.920 --> 16:23.720
Oh, because Marxist analysis is boring? And it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles?

16:23.720 --> 16:27.640
But you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Aren't you discrediting yourself by using

16:27.640 --> 16:29.160
David Icke's vocabulary?

16:29.160 --> 16:33.240
Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books. Can the same be said of Horkheimer?

16:33.240 --> 16:34.600
Have you read Horkheimer?

16:34.600 --> 16:35.160
Yes.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.520
Have you read Kropotkin?

16:36.520 --> 16:37.080
Yes.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.200
Have you read Bakunin?

16:39.160 --> 16:39.800
No.

16:39.800 --> 16:42.680
You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.

16:43.560 --> 16:44.680
Have you read Plakhanov?

16:44.680 --> 16:45.080
No.

16:45.400 --> 16:46.440
Have you read Goldman?

16:47.160 --> 16:48.120
Have you read Zetkin?

16:48.760 --> 16:49.800
Have you read Gramsci?

16:50.360 --> 16:51.960
Have you read Grindelwald?

16:51.960 --> 16:54.120
Have you read Slobodan Zarathusian?

16:54.120 --> 16:55.880
Have you read Sextus Arcanus?

16:55.880 --> 16:57.240
Have you read Slot Skanarevsky?

16:57.240 --> 16:57.800
TABBY!

16:57.800 --> 17:01.880
I have half a PhD in reading tedious blowhards, and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading

17:01.880 --> 17:02.920
any of that shit.

17:02.920 --> 17:07.160
And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded Eastern Bloc gibberish is a prerequisite for

17:07.160 --> 17:10.040
talking to you, then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.280
I think I'm just gonna go.

17:12.280 --> 17:13.400
This isn't really working out.

17:14.120 --> 17:14.760
Wait.

17:14.760 --> 17:15.260
TABBY.

17:16.840 --> 17:18.840
Before you go, let me say one more thing.

17:22.280 --> 17:32.680
If you ever change your mind about leaving, leaving me behind

17:32.680 --> 17:39.800
Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin', bring it on home to me

17:40.840 --> 17:42.440
Yeah, yeah

17:42.440 --> 17:54.520
I know I laughed when you left, but now I only, I only hurt myself

17:54.520 --> 18:02.520
Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me

18:02.520 --> 18:04.520
Yeah, yeah

18:04.520 --> 18:10.520
I'll bring you jewelry and money too

18:10.520 --> 18:11.960
But that ain't all

18:12.440 --> 18:24.520
Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me

18:24.520 --> 18:26.520
Yeah, yeah

18:26.520 --> 18:37.480
I know I'll always be your slave Until I'm buried, buried in my grave

18:37.480 --> 18:39.480
TABBY

18:39.480 --> 18:41.480
Bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me

18:41.480 --> 18:53.480
we love, bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:53.480 --> 18:55.880
Bring it on home, cat girl.

18:55.880 --> 18:56.880
Unsubscribed.

19:04.080 --> 19:07.140
It's fucking 2018, man.
