0	7600	When you look into the pools of the 9-11 memorial at the World Trade Center, you start to ask
7600	9400	yourself questions.
9400	11360	Why is the world bad?
11360	13600	What did all these people die for?
13600	16660	Well, for freedom, I guess.
16660	19640	And like, American values?
19640	21260	But what are those values?
21260	24920	What kind of freedom is it that we have?
24920	29960	The 9-11 memorial shares the World Trade Center site with the largest shopping mall in Manhattan.
29960	35600	There's a Forever 21, an Under Armour, a Kate Spade, and a pair of shoes that I want,
35600	39640	but they're too expensive and my feet are too big and I'm too tall to wear high heels
39640	40640	anyway.
40640	41640	Ugh.
41640	47960	Fuckin' neoliberalism?
47960	50080	What even goes on in these big buildings?
50080	53400	I've been looking at them all my life, but I've never been inside one.
53400	59120	Are these the towers where the ruling lizards gather, drinking human blood, licking whipped
59120	59940	cream off the ends?
59940	63700	Are these the interns?
63700	66000	What the hell even is this country?
66000	69820	Just the same terrible shit copy-pasted all over the goddamn place.
69820	76900	Longhorn Steakhouse, Golden Corral, Staples, The Red Lobster, PetSmart, Chipotle, Fridays,
76900	77900	Dave & Buster's.
77900	84620	I guess it's not so bad, as long as you kick things up a notch.
84620	89620	Yes, I want to add the lava cakes to my order.
89620	90300	Dominoes?
90300	92380	Of course I want the fucking lava cakes.
92380	96380	I'm gonna put the cake on the pizza.
96380	97380	Put it all in me.
97380	98380	Fill me up.
98380	99380	Oh, goddammit.
99380	106380	It was so good, but I ate so much I think I'm gonna die.
106380	110380	Look what capitalism made me do.
110380	117380	...control of vast parts of territory all across the Middle East.
117380	118380	State foot number...
118380	118780	...state foot number...
118780	119300	State foot number...
119300	120540	State foot number...

147180	148040	State foot number...
148040	148340	State foot number...
148340	152880	slur against queer teenagers, but it comes from the movie Fight Club, where it refers
152880	157240	to a generation of white guys who have become adults only to find that they're worse off
157240	162280	than their fathers, that they don't have glamorous jobs, they don't have girlfriends, and, more
162280	166300	recently, that even in the escapist world of video games their absolute sovereignty
166300	167300	is being challenged.
167300	174140	I've devoted half my channel to chronicling the deranged consequences of this situation.
174140	180020	Anti-feminism, alpha males, pick-up artists, the surreal surge in support for a white ethnic
180020	181020	homeland.
181020	184780	But till now I haven't talked about the underlying causes, and it's important to
184780	189980	do that because, the thing is, the white men aren't even wrong that society is screwing
189980	194300	them in some way, it's just that it's screwing everyone else even more.
194300	198700	So the masculinist alt-right analysis of society is exactly upside down.
198700	203200	Guys, you are not under the thumb of a Jewish feminist plot to turn you into girly soyboy
203200	204140	cucks.
204140	208420	Cultural Marxism did not turn you into placid Ikea consumers.
208420	209420	Capitalism did.
209420	213740	So what you need to do is stop scapegoating non-whites, feminists, and trans people and
213740	218980	unite with the rest of us to actually do something about the real enemy, the blood-sucking goddamn
218980	229580	reptiles.
229580	230580	Chapter One.
230580	231580	Capitalism and Spirit.
231580	232920	Oh god, I sound like a philosopher.
232920	233920	Someone shut up.
234140	235140	Don't shoot me.
235140	239840	Remember that Nazi propaganda video where Richard Spencer says that a nation based on
239840	243200	freedom is just another place to go shopping?
243200	245460	A leftist could easily have said that.
245460	249640	We think of leftist analysis as being very materialistic, but there's a spiritual dimension
249640	250640	to it too.
250640	254380	Much of Karl Marx's early writings are primarily concerned with the state of the human soul
254380	259140	under capitalism, with the alienation of working not for yourself but for an employer who appropriates
259140	263180	the value of your work, with the fetishism of commodities, the investment of inanimate
263180	263980	objects with transcendence.
263980	270940	With the system of lies and delusions by which capitalism understands and justifies itself,
270940	275280	with fucking Comcast increasing my bill to $70 a month for no fucking reason.
275280	277280	No, I don't want a landline.
277280	278980	No one under the age of 60 wants a landline.
278980	282880	Of course, it's not just Marxists who complain about a capitalist malaise.
282880	287420	Fascists and conservatives notice it too, only they think the solution is to seek collective
287420	290980	meeting in ancient customs, racial chauvinism, or fight clubs.
290980	292980	And that shit's not really my scene.
292980	298040	I'm really more of a pursuit of individual happiness person, but I think that capitalism
298040	301840	as we know it is pretty bad at fostering individual happiness.
301840	303240	And here's why.
303240	304240	Chapter 2.
304240	305240	Alienated labor.
305240	307480	Ugh, this Marxist jargon sucks.
307480	309000	Let's come up with something new.
309000	310060	Chapter 2.
310060	311060	Shitty jobs.
311060	312860	Why is your job so shitty?
312860	317260	Well, probably it's because you work at the Comcast customer service call center, and
317260	321020	you spend your day dealing with whiny, entitled white bitches who don't understand that you're
321020	322980	just a lackey without any actual power.
322980	326860	And the system is organized so that people with no power just have to pointlessly shout
326860	327860	at each other.
327860	331380	You don't have any stake in the profit of Comcast as a company, so you don't really
331380	335200	have any reason to give a shit about the success of the corporate machine in which you are
335200	336200	a gear.
336200	341320	The CEO makes $36 million a year, while you make $14 an hour, which means that a lot of
341320	345260	the value of the work you're doing doesn't get paid to you, but goes straight up the
345260	348560	chain of command and into the pockets of the chief lizards.
348560	352060	The ruthless hierarchical structure of the company means that you're competing against
352060	355940	your fellow employees for a promotion, or even to not be laid off.
355940	359820	And if that happens, you'll end up competing against other unemployed people for another
359820	365980	shitty job as a concrete lifter, or a mud mule, or maybe even a coffee shop MacBook
365980	366980	person.
366980	370580	This means it's difficult to even experience companionship with the other people in your
370580	375340	shitty situation, because you're all being pitted against each other by the goddamn reptiles.
375340	380560	And it gets even worse, you could be employed by new age reptiles who force you to participate
380560	381940	in team building exercises.
381940	387220	Companies scavenger hunts, mandatory fun, which means that not only do you have a shitty
387220	391720	oppressive job, but you're not even allowed the basic pleasure of openly hating your life.
391720	395600	You have to constantly pretend that you're having fun, all for the sake of maintaining
395600	398980	the overlord's comfortable delusion that he's not your overlord.
398980	402780	These lizards are smart, and they keep coming up with more elaborate ways to lie to you.
402780	406740	If you work for Uber, they won't even be honest about the fact that you're their employee.
406740	408860	They'll call you an independent contractor.
408860	409860	I'm sorry.
409860	410860	I'm sorry.
410860	412060	I'm sorry.
412060	414640	You get to be your own boss and set your own hours.
414640	419100	You only have to take out the initial loan, buy the car, pay the insurance, pay for the
419100	424420	cleaning, take on all the risk, and give Uber 25% without getting a guaranteed wage, benefits,
424420	425920	paid leave, or pension.
425920	429100	So much better than being an old-fashioned employee, right?
429100	433080	No, please don't transfer me to the billing department, they already transferred me here.
433080	434080	Chapter 3.
434080	435080	Advertising.
435080	438100	Is it pretentious to use chapters in a YouTube video?
438100	440860	What if each section is named after an episode in the Odyssey?
440860	444780	If you've lived your life in America, you've spent every day since birth assailed from
444780	451300	all directions by propaganda campaigns for cereals, and cigarettes, and sugar snacks,
451300	453480	and now you can't get no satisfaction.
453480	457320	Jesus, people have been complaining about advertising so long it's come to seem like
457320	459420	a basic feature of the human condition.
459420	463500	But it's not a basic feature of the human condition, it's a situation particular to
463500	464500	life under capitalism.
464500	468940	I mean, North Korea is a dystopian shithole, but at least the train station isn't cluttered
468940	470060	up with advertisements for- oh.
470060	470260	Oh.
470260	472220	Oh.
472220	473220	So many fans.
473220	475620	Contrapoints is a tankie confirmed.
475620	477640	A neoliberal tankie.
477640	482400	The purpose of advertising is to manufacture desires, which brands across the world spend
482400	485120	nearly $500 billion a year doing.
485120	489260	The ubiquity and apparent effectiveness of advertising seems to contradict one of the
489260	494240	fundamental assumptions of capitalist society, namely that we're all autonomous individuals
494240	497700	making rational choices in pursuit of our own well-being.
497700	500180	Advertising uses a lot of rhetorical strategies that are not-
500180	505440	very rational, for instance. Randomly correlating the product with sexual desire. Generating new
505440	509620	insecurities the product promises to alleviate. Associating the product with social status.
509760	514320	Associating the product with random famous people. Associating the product with degenerate decadence.
514420	517920	Associating the product with progressive social movements. Associating the product
517920	522660	with communist revolutions. Gazing longingly at dreamy Argentinian philosophy professors.
522660	528640	Join the clone army. Completely original lighting. Gay orgies. Love cannot survive
528640	533980	without diamonds. Is this rational? Does it help people make genuine decisions about their own best
533980	538860	interests? Of course not. The goal of advertising is not to satisfy the pre-existing needs that
538860	544000	people have. It's to endlessly create new needs. And that's a lot to keep up with and it takes a
544000	549240	lot of stamina. Which is why it's a good thing I discovered Vitalimax Plus. Every evening before
549240	554700	I start writing or shooting a video, I insert two Vitalimax Plus suppositories for a sustainable
554700	558620	blast in power. With all natural ginseng and opium extracts,
558640	565760	Vitalimax Plus gives me the reckless euphoria and indifference to paint that I need to get it in.
565760	570640	I start with a couple dozen oysters, eat some molly, maybe hit a couple ammels, then I take
570640	578600	my Vitalimax Plus and I'm ready to rip it open. Vitalimax. For bottoms.
578600	582880	Consumer society is all about goddamn lizards inventing desires which they implant in your
582880	587260	brain through advertising. Then they sell you the product that fulfills the desire that
587260	588480	they invented.
588480	598020	So what we have is a society built not around meeting basic human needs or maximizing human
598020	603140	happiness, but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to want and
603140	607440	then sell it to you. And this would be a grim state of affairs in any circumstances, but it's
607440	612000	especially egregious in a country where many of the basic needs are not met. On the one hand,
612220	617040	we have 40 million people living in this country with medical debt, spiraling tuition costs leading
617040	618460	college students to take out loans, and we have a society built not around meeting basic human needs,
618480	618980	but around the extravagant profits of powerful reptiles who tell you what to want and then sell it to you.
618980	624560	They may never escape, more than half a million homeless people, and 13 million children who have to go to school hungry.
624560	629940	And on the other hand, we apparently have the resources to mass produce $400 juice packet
629940	635020	squeezing machines and $300 luxury ice cubes, and there are apparently Americans who are
635020	640060	willing to spend $50 million on Barnett Newman paintings. I mean it's a fine painting, it's
640060	645100	got a lot of great red on it, but is it really worth the cost of feeding every homeless person
645100	646880	in America for two weeks?
646880	647320	Is this what an efficient economy looks like?
647320	647820	Is this what an efficient economy looks like?
647820	648320	Is this what an efficient economy looks like?
648320	648440	Is this what an efficient economy looks like?
648440	649480	Is this what an efficient economy looks like?
649480	654120	If GDP is your only measure of efficiency, then maybe, but shouldn't the economy serve
654120	656040	humanity rather than the other way around?
656040	660120	If millions of people are struggling under the weight of student debt, underemployment,
660120	665080	and outrageous medical costs, then who gives a shit how many golden donuts we can produce?
665080	673320	No cuts to Medicaid! Save our liberty!
673320	675080	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
675080	677720	Canto 4, message to the rich.
677720	678280	All right you
678280	680760	filthy goddamn reptiles, listen up.
680760	685080	I have a pretty good barometer for internet politics, which is to say, politics. I mean,
685080	688920	I noticed the alt-right thing pretty early, and you can assign as much or as little significance
688920	692280	to that as you choose. But what I'm picking up at the moment is that people are getting
692280	696200	fucking mad, and they're starting to get mad specifically at you, the rich.
696200	700680	And you don't just have to trust my intuitions here. Recent polling data shows that a majority
700680	706040	of adults under the age of 30 do not support capitalism, and almost a third support socialism.
706040	708120	This is not the 80s anymore, you can't continue to be a rich person if you don't support capitalism.
708120	711560	You can't continue to get richer and richer while the rest of the country is underemployed,
711560	713720	in debt, and unable to afford healthcare.
713720	717640	What you're doing has been tried before, and it doesn't end well. You can't just
717640	722280	stroll around town dressed like this, and live in houses like this, when there are millions
722280	726520	of peasants who don't have enough to eat. They will eventually try to cut your heads off.
726520	729240	And judging by the mood I'm picking up on social media right now,
729240	733240	if you don't fix some shit and make life better for the masses, they are gonna cut your fucking
733240	737480	heads off. I mean, they won't actually cut your heads off, but they will try, and you'll have to
737480	742360	deploy militarized police, and you will crush them ruthlessly, but it's gonna be a whole thing,
743000	746440	bad for profits, and just all around a real inconvenience for you.
746440	750680	Nosy humanitarians will butt their heads in, and they're gonna make things awkward.
750680	755080	The point is, shit cannot continue the way it's going. Something is gonna have to change,
755080	759000	and we can do this the easy way, or the hard way. The choice is up to you.
765720	766120	Well?
766760	767400	Are you going?
767480	768760	To answer the phone?
770200	774760	There is no phone. There is only the sigh of the oppressed creature.
775560	780920	The heart of a heartless world. The soul of a soulless condition.
781880	783800	It's best to just try and ignore it.
787320	790040	Episode 5, Message to the Youth.
790040	794040	Alright kids, so you're angry. Well, good. The world sucks.
794040	796760	There's a lot to be angry about. What we have to do next,
796760	801240	is decide what to do with that anger. I don't think tweeting aggressively is gonna cut it.
801240	802440	So, what do we do?
804120	805240	Smash?
805240	807080	Tabby, get in here. Sit down.
809400	813240	Look, I know I've been kind of hard on you. Harsh words have been exchanged.
813240	817560	But I need young radicals like you in my life. The minute I stop listening to people like you,
817560	821800	is the minute I become irrelevant. So I apologize. I never meant to hurt you.
822520	823560	Baby, I'm sorry.
824600	826680	I mean look, I get it. Smashing is fun.
827080	829640	But we also need to have a real plan. That's all I'm saying.
830280	831000	So what's the plan?
831800	832840	Revolution.
832840	839160	Okay, yeah, revolution. I mean, you're right. Donald Trump is president. Fuck it. Revolution.
839160	843880	We've gotta get better people in office. We've gotta vote in a whole different kind of politician, right?
843880	845080	No, revolution.
846040	848920	Yes, I know, revolution. But what kind of revolution? Like,
848920	853640	Project Mayhem? Gather your muskets, ye militiamen, and water the Tree of Liberty? What?
853640	855560	No, I mean direct action.
855560	856600	Okay, so like,
856680	857880	a general strike?
857880	859320	No, end capitalism.
865720	869000	Tabby, I'm not trying to say I have all the answers here, because I really don't,
869000	871640	but I think we should at least try to come up with something a little more
871640	877000	substantive than just saying the word revolution. Like, I'm in support of radical movements.
877000	882440	Occupy Wall Street, 1960s uprisings, I think these kinds of movements can generate a lot of energy,
882440	886600	they shift the Overton window to the left, and they can have a big cultural impact. But none of them
886600	892120	so far has ended capitalism. And capitalism needs the state to maintain its power, and we can change
892120	896520	the state through electoral politics, so why not direct some serious energy toward that?
896520	900920	Well, revolutions have worked in Russia and China, but no elected politician has
900920	905960	ever even come close to ending capitalism in the US, so why do you think that will work?
905960	909560	What's to stop whoever you elect from getting absorbed by the same corrupt,
909560	913560	finance-backed system that every politician eventually has to swear allegiance to?
913560	916440	Well, you're not entirely wrong. But on the other hand, Chinese,
916440	920840	and Soviet communism were not exactly super great, and in any case, I'm having a little bit
920840	927320	of trouble imagining a 1917-style revolutionary army marching down Pennsylvania Avenue in 2018.
927320	931880	Shouldn't we focus on protecting abortion, and getting affordable healthcare and education,
931880	937320	and ending mass incarceration and other achievable goals? What if the 2020 election is postponed?
937320	941640	Well, then I will transition into you and become you unironically. Why not just be honest about
941640	945720	your political stance? Are you a democratic socialist, or would you actually support a
945720	946280	revolution?
946440	950280	Well, I prefer to just describe my positions and let others decide on the labels.
950280	954200	Now, for you, Contrapoints, I mean, you're still a heretic and an enemy of the
954200	958120	Imperium and you are a demonette of Slanesh and everything like that, but I still like you.
960920	963000	Well, what exactly are your positions?
963000	964120	Um, well...
965160	971800	Kill everyone now! Condone first-degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit!
971800	975960	Filth are my politics? Eat reptiles?
975960	978920	Why do you keep saying reptiles when you mean capitalists?
978920	983720	Oh, because Marxist analysis is boring? And it's more interesting if the capitalists are reptiles?
983720	987640	But you sound like a conspiracy theorist. Aren't you discrediting yourself by using
987640	989160	David Icke's vocabulary?
989160	993240	Well, David Icke is selling a lot of books. Can the same be said of Horkheimer?
993240	994600	Have you read Horkheimer?
994600	995160	Yes.
995160	996520	Have you read Kropotkin?
996520	997080	Yes.
997080	998200	Have you read Bakunin?
999160	999800	No.
999800	1002680	You really can't understand these issues until you've read Bakunin.
1003560	1004680	Have you read Plakhanov?
1004680	1005080	No.
1005400	1006440	Have you read Goldman?
1007160	1008120	Have you read Zetkin?
1008760	1009800	Have you read Gramsci?
1010360	1011960	Have you read Grindelwald?
1011960	1014120	Have you read Slobodan Zarathusian?
1014120	1015880	Have you read Sextus Arcanus?
1015880	1017240	Have you read Slot Skanarevsky?
1017240	1017800	TABBY!
1017800	1021880	I have half a PhD in reading tedious blowhards, and I'm telling you right now I ain't reading
1021880	1022920	any of that shit.
1022920	1027160	And if being an encyclopedia of long-winded Eastern Bloc gibberish is a prerequisite for
1027160	1030040	talking to you, then no one is going to listen to what you have to say.
1030920	1032280	I think I'm just gonna go.
1032280	1033400	This isn't really working out.
1034120	1034760	Wait.
1034760	1035260	TABBY.
1036840	1038840	Before you go, let me say one more thing.
1042280	1052680	If you ever change your mind about leaving, leaving me behind
1052680	1059800	Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet lovin', bring it on home to me
1060840	1062440	Yeah, yeah
1062440	1074520	I know I laughed when you left, but now I only, I only hurt myself
1074520	1082520	Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me
1082520	1084520	Yeah, yeah
1084520	1090520	I'll bring you jewelry and money too
1090520	1091960	But that ain't all
1092440	1104520	Oh baby, bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me
1104520	1106520	Yeah, yeah
1106520	1117480	I know I'll always be your slave Until I'm buried, buried in my grave
1117480	1119480	TABBY
1119480	1121480	Bring it to me, bring your sweet love, bring it on home to me
1121480	1133480	we love, bring it on home to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
1133480	1135880	Bring it on home, cat girl.
1135880	1136880	Unsubscribed.
1144080	1147140	It's fucking 2018, man.
