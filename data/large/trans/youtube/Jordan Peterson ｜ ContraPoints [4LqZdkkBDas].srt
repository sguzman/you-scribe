1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,000
My lords, ladies, and those that lieth betwixt,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
tis evident, nor sensation nor the passions possess dominion over the mind of man,

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:17,000
which is ruled instead by a reason, sovereign of all faculties.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It must needs be remarked that the power of the Commonwealth

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
deriveth not from the despotical acquisitions of conquerors,

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:35,000
but from that covenant amongst men, whereby they most resembleth the lobster.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Ah, Farbington, are we doing this again?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Lady Farbington, I'm so happy to finally meet the real you.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
EnchantÃ©.

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I'm not gonna kiss your hand, you freak. I'm more of a woman than you are.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's not what they were saying at the Parisian salon.

12
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Clock me, Amadeus.

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Don't break the fourth wall. I'm trying to make a video about postmodernism.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Get out of my drawing room, eighteenth-century scum.

15
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Sexual deviance.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
So much for the tolerant Jacobins.

17
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Reason. Power. Truth.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
These are the kinds of topics that I simply don't care about.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Unfortunately, we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So who's Jordan Peterson?

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Well, he's a psychology professor at the University of Toronto,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
who got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
shall surely lead to Stalinism.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Since then, he's been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the Western world,

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and his self-help book, Twelve Rules for Life, is a national and international bestseller.

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I'm starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously.

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He's got a lot of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here, because I want to talk.

29
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
haven't really engaged with his ideas very much.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
He's often caricatured, avoided, or talked past,

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
as in the infamous BBC interview,

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
where Cathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So you're saying that by and large, women are too agreeable to get the pay rises they deserve?

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, I'm saying that that's one component.

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies?

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
No.

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You're just saying these things though to provoke, aren't you?

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I mean, you are a provocateur.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I never say anything.

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to.

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I think to people watching this, it comes off as if leftists are like, afraid of his actual ideas.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But I'm not afraid of his ideas.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not afraid of anything.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Daddy.

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson's lectures and podcasts and reading his books,

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and honestly, I think I get why people like him.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Clearly, he has real talent as a public speaker and as a kind of life coach.

51
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:08,000
His book, Twelve Rules for Life, echoes past bestsellers like Stephen Covey's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
or Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life.

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like take responsibility for yourself,

54
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
don't envy other people, and he renews them with the intellectual trappings of psychology, philosophy,

55
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
He's telling us a pretty classic story.

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering,

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
so you need a higher purpose in your life.

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But I knew that already.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I learned it at the AA meetings I refused to go to.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
These are like basic insights of world philosophy and religion.

62
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
But they're insights that today's youths apparently haven't heard before.

63
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Or at any rate, they haven't heard them in a vocabulary they connected with.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So to a lot of people, Peterson's ideas hurt.

66
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
They seem new and urgent.

67
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
And I don't really object to any of the self-help stuff.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Most of Peterson's fans are young men.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
And, I mean, someone has to whip the neckbeards into shape.

70
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And if Peterson can do that, more power to him.

71
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I mean, sometimes boys just need a daddy.

72
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
And sometimes girls do too.

73
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But there's a big problem here.

74
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
And the problem is that all of this life coaching is basically just a Trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda.

75
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help,

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
not merely as a guide to private life,

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
but as a replacement for progressive politics,

78
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.

79
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
There's no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?

80
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why not?

81
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy.

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now, Peterson doesn't use the word progressive politics,

83
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
because that doesn't sound scary enough.

84
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,000
His new, scarier word is postmodern neo-Marxism.

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Now, we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neo-Marxism

86
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
with cultural Marxism,

87
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
the Nazi conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Surely, this is not the same thing as that, right?

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Right?

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
So look, I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist.

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
And you may quote me on that.

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But I am wondering, if it's not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West,

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
then what is postmodern neo-Marxism?

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Well, JP, that's what I'd like to talk about.

95
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
So Jordan, sorry, Dr. Peterson,

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Professor,

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Daddy,

98
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
let's talk.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,000
And for once, I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect I think it deserves.

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
That's good.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's a good temperature.

102
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Hand me the oil, would you, Daddy?

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Thanks, Daddy.

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's really an honour to bathe with a public intellectual.

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
The intellectual of your stature.

106
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You know, I never like to argue in the bath,

107
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
so I want to start by telling you the things I like about you.

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the Left,

109
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
the stifling of even slightly different opinions,

110
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments,

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the politics of resentment,

112
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person.

114
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So if you're into dysphoria, please don't watch it.

115
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
But my worry is that you're leading an international political backlash

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
against what is a very localized problem.

117
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And I worry that some of our society's most vulnerable people could be hurt by that backlash.

118
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Like, fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly sensitive student activists,

119
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
but if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights,

120
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
that would be bad, right?

121
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I also like that you tell people how to live their lives.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I mean, I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom,

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
but, clearly, the sheep need a shepherd.

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And you've really stepped up with these 12 rules.

125
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You know, in the Left, we don't really tell people what to do.

126
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We tell them what not to do.

127
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't exploit the workers.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Do not do blackface.

129
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people,

130
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
but that's a pretty small rule compared to some of your rules,

131
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
like how to raise your children,

132
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
or when it's okay to do that.

133
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Is it okay to criticize things?

134
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The last thing I like is you talk about deep shit.

135
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons

136
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
were talking about Plato and Aristotle and the meaning of life,

137
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
and I thought, huh.

138
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
On the Left, we don't really talk about that kind of thing.

139
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
All we talk about is how society oppresses people.

140
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
And that might not be enough,

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
because people need to have a positive purpose in life.

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I mean, personally, I don't give a shit.

143
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I'm pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
of Strangers with Candy until I die.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
But other people, like Dostoevsky, Camus,

146
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
other white guys who talk about lobsters,

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering

148
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and, like, not just complain about patriarchy.

149
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I guess it's easier to not complain about patriarchy

150
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
when patriarchy isn't the thing that's making you suffer.

151
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But I do think that an education that only teaches people

152
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
about oppression is inadequate.

153
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad,

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
and then we say, well, you're educated now,

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye!

156
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
And that really kinda sucks.

157
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,000
But you know, I think that's a point that could probably be made

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
without comparing transgender activism to Stalin.

159
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I feel like this came across a little more sarcastic than I intended.

160
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
See, this is why you've got to use a firmer hand with me, Peterson.

161
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
If you don't establish dominance, I'm just gonna mouth off.

162
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
They use all this compassion language,

163
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and I'm on the side of the oppressed.

164
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
They use all of that posturing.

165
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power.

166
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
And I've just been starting to review their curriculum

167
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
for children from kindergarten to grade eight.

168
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
It's pure social justice postmodernism.

169
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The people who hold this doctrine,

170
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
this radical postmodern communitarian doctrine

171
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,000
that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity

172
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
or some kind of group identity paramount,

173
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:11,000
they've got control over the most low-committing,

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
low-to-mid-level bureaucratic structures.

175
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
And many governments as well.

176
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
But even in the United States, where, you know, a lot of...

177
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I don't know.

178
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So you've got to give it to J.P.

179
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
When he says,

180
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
stand up straight with your shoulders back,

181
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
he means it.

182
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences

183
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
with fairly popular opinions.

184
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Political correctness often feels stifling.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive.

186
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use,

187
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
and I don't like it.

188
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But once he draws you in

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
with these inviting preludes,

190
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
he leads you to a pretty weird place.

191
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
His central political message is that

192
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
leftist professors, student activists,

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
campus diversity initiatives,

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and corporate HR departments

195
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
are collectively following the philosophy

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
of postmodern neo-Marxism

197
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
to destroy Western civilization

198
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and sink us all into a totalitarian nightmare.

199
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Now there's just no avoiding that this idea

200
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
is actually pretty similar to the cultural Marxism

201
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
or cultural Bolshevism theory.

202
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
But I'm just going to repeat it.

203
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
So ignore that,

204
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
because if I dwell on it,

205
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll sound like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist,

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and then everyone will think I'm crazy.

207
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Look, I'm not afraid of psychologists.

208
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I don't have anything to hide.

209
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
So let's just try not to think about that,

210
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
and instead straightforwardly ask,

211
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
is it true that postmodern neo-Marxism

212
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
is out to destroy us all?

213
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Well, why don't we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism?

214
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We all know what Marxism is,

215
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
the idea that society should be understood

216
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
as a class struggle between workers and capitalists,

217
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and that the workers will eventually revolt.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Some college professors definitely do believe that,

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
but 0% of corporate HR departments do,

220
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
so that...

221
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Okay.

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So what is postmodernism?

223
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Well, it's the vaguest word in the English language.

224
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Some people try to explain it

225
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
by listing all the things that are called postmodern,

226
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and then trying to guess what they have in common.

227
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
That's basically what the YouTuber Armored Skeptic

228
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
did in his video about it.

229
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
So many daddies in this video.

230
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
We should invite them all to a barbecue,

231
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
complain about postmodernism,

232
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
listen to some Zeppelin.

233
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I've had worse evenings.

234
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't think there really is a common thread

235
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
linking all the things called postmodern.

236
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Basically, postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945

237
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
that seemed new at the time.

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism,

239
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
he's not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino.

240
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He's talking about postmodern philosophy.

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
So what's that?

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Well...

243
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Basically, it's a kind of skepticism.

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Not YouTube skepticism,

245
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
but actual skepticism.

246
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You know, like having doubts

247
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
about whether humans can really know things.

248
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea.

249
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That goes way back to ancient times.

250
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
But more specifically,

251
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

252
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
So what's modernism?

253
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
What's what?

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
What are words?

255
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
What's anything?

256
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm going to divide modernism into two periods

257
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
because I feel like it.

258
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
First, there's early modernism.

259
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Early modernism is the philosophy developed

260
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
by a bunch of boring 18th century queens

261
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
which says that we can form universal theories

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
about the world through observation and reasoning,

263
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
aka the scientific method.

264
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Now that turns out to work pretty well

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
for whatever questions you have about plants and crystals

266
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
and how to medically reconfigure human genitals,

267
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
but it has some limits,

268
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
which was pointed out by David Hume,

269
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
one of the least boring 18th century queens

270
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
and one of the only philosophers

271
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I can actually put up with in small doses

272
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
even though he was a fucking racist

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
and also Scottish.

274
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This is a callout.

275
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective,

276
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
you can't really know much about important things

277
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
like morality, causation,

278
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
and the self

279
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
because those aren't the kinds of things you can observe.

280
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Anyway, then the late modernists came along

281
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
and they said,

282
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
fuck Hume,

283
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
we're going to do science about those things anyway.

284
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards

285
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
who, one way or another,

286
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:25,000
tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans.

287
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
So for example, you have psychoanalysis,

288
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
which said human nature can be understood

289
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
in terms of unconscious drives,

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
which is of course ridiculous.

291
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'm conscious of all my drives.

292
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
And you got Marxism,

293
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat.

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You got early sociology and anthropology,

295
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
which started out with racist social evolutionism

296
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
and progressed to a kind of

297
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
we're all the same universalism.

298
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists.

299
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
His first book, Maps of Meaning,

300
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world

301
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
and create order out of chaos

302
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
through universal myths and archetypes,

303
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
which he claims are a product of our species' evolutionary past.

304
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Boy, this is a lot of explaining.

305
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
It's so much explaining,

306
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
it's triggering gender dysphoria.

307
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I better put on some longer nails.

308
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Nails?

309
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Is that all womanhood means to you?

310
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

311
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
So whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories

312
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
about reality, history, and humanity,

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
postmodernists say,

314
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
actually, no, that's not possible.

315
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
For example, the French postmodernist

316
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Michel Foucault

317
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Sargon?

318
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You little goose.

319
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Michel Foucault

320
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
wrote intellectual histories of subjects

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice,

322
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
in which he argued that we should not understand these histories

323
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
as straightforward progressions toward liberty and scientific truth,

324
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
but rather as mere shifts in the way that power

325
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
orders our institutions and populations.

326
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
The other postmodernist I've actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty.

327
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Yeah, fuck you, Derrida.

328
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read.

329
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls ironism,

330
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
irony being the skeptical caution

331
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
with which we should regard our own beliefs and our awareness

332
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
that our vocabulary for describing and understanding the world

333
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
is not the final or best vocabulary.

334
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Alright, that's enough explaining.

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
And my nails are done. Check it out.

336
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Do you enjoy having long, glamorous nails

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
but do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them

338
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
with barely concealed visceral rage?

339
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Well, I have a solution for you.

340
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
The bisexual manicure.

341
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
One hand for the V, one hand for the D.

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Both for degeneracy.

343
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
It's absolutely filthy.

344
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
So we've got all the pieces on the table.

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Now we've just got to put the puzzle together.

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
On the one hand, we have Marxism,

347
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
a fundamentally modernist worldview

348
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
that theorizes the human condition in economic terms.

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
On the other hand, we have postmodernism,

350
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity

351
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
to know any universal truths about anything.

352
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,000
On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas are not compatible.

353
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
And there is an extensive history of dispute between them,

354
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
with, for instance, the Marxist Sartre

355
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
calling Foucault

356
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.

357
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,000
And of course, as we all know, when Foucault died,

358
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
capitalism did end forever.

359
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So where does Peterson get off talking about postmodern neo-Marxism?

360
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Well, it's true that a lot of postmodernists

361
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
were in some way influenced by Marxism,

362
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
so the phrase could just refer to that continuity.

363
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
But that's not what Peterson means.

364
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
It's clear from the way he uses the term

365
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical

366
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
than it initially appears.

367
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Peterson uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism

368
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
to include not only postmodern intellectuals

369
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and Marxist intellectuals,

370
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,000
but also liberal politicians, academic administrators,

371
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
and corporate HR departments that care about diversity,

372
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
and so-called identity politics activists,

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists.

374
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Basically, it's the entirety of the modern left.

375
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Now, I've already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism

376
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
are fundamentally at odds,

377
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
since Marxism is a big story about a struggle

378
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
between two clear and distinct groups,

379
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this,

380
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
and about the stability of binaries

381
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
like bourgeoisie and proletariat.

382
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
But that's not the only tension in Peterson's

383
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
clusterfuck idea of postmodern neo-Marxism.

384
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows

385
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
that Marxists and identity politics activists

386
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
are constantly at each other's throats,

387
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
because the Marxists accuse the activists

388
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
of being bourgeois dogs who want more female CEOs of color

389
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and more disabled transgender drone pilots,

390
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
while the activists accuse the Marxists

391
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
of being a boys' club of brocialists

392
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
no more woke on gender and race issues

393
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
than the average Jordan Peterson fan.

394
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Most often, these accusations are correct,

395
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
because everyone is problematic,

396
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
and I disown them all.

397
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
And then there's also the conflict

398
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
between the identity politics activists

399
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
and the postmodernists.

400
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern?

401
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
There's nothing postmodern about it.

402
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice,

403
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
for particular groups, such as women, people of color,

404
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
and gay and trans people.

405
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This kind of activism presupposes

406
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
that these group categories exist

407
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
and are a useful basis for political organizing.

408
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Postmodernists do kind of the opposite.

409
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
They want to show that these categories

410
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
race, gender, sexual orientation,

411
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
are contingent social constructs

412
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
and are themselves potentially oppressive.

413
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This is why conventional feminist activists

414
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
often hate postmodern feminism.

415
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Because the postmodern feminists want to show

416
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that the whole concept of womanhood, for instance,

417
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
is contingent and potentially oppressive,

418
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and they think we should be working to destabilize

419
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and undermine it.

420
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
And then the conventional feminist activists say,

421
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
the fuck?

422
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
We need the concept of womanhood

423
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
to organize around women's political interests.

424
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
How are we supposed to do that

425
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
if we undermine and destabilize the concept of womanhood?

426
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
And in turn, the postmodern feminists say,

427
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
well, here's a quotation from Judith Butler,

428
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the most famous postmodern feminist ever.

429
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Is it not a sign of despair over public politics

430
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
when identity becomes its own policy,

431
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
bringing with it those who would police it

432
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
from various sides?

433
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And this is not a call to return to silence

434
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
or invisibility,

435
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
but rather to make use of a category

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
that can be called into question,

437
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
made to account for what it excludes.

438
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you take the first part of that quote out of context,

439
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
it almost sounds like something

440
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Jordan Peterson could have said.

441
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The difference is that J.P. actually does think

442
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
we should return to silence and invisibility.

443
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Or does he?

444
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
It's hard to tell what he thinks.

445
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
More on that in a moment.

446
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
I bring all of this up to show that

447
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
1 the idea of postmodern neo-Marxist identity politics

448
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical

449
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
and 2 identity politics is not this dogma

450
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
that must go unquestioned.

451
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
There are sophisticated debates about this

452
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
going on within leftist academia,

453
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
but Jordan Peterson either doesn't know that

454
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
or doesn't care.

455
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
He uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism

456
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
to characterize the left as a unified philosophical force

457
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
bent on destroying Western civilization

458
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
when in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons

459
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
who can't stop squabbling with each other

460
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
over every goddamn little issue.

461
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
The only reason I can think of

462
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
that the left would appear to be a unified philosophical force

463
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
is if you're so far to the right

464
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that literally everyone who supports

465
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
the economic and social advancement of disadvantaged groups

466
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
looks like one homogenous enemy.

467
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
But is that what Jordan Peterson is saying?

468
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
That he opposes all social progress

469
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
for women, racial, and sexual minorities?

470
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Well, it's difficult to say

471
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
because while he spends much of his time

472
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
comparing activists for these movements

473
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
to 20th century mass murderers,

474
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
he resists being pinned down

475
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
to any more specific position.

476
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I was maybe too harsh on Cathy Newman earlier.

477
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
She came out of that interview looking bad,

478
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
but she had a tough job to do.

479
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves

480
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
saying something that's more or less

481
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
uncontroversially true,

482
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
while at the same time implying something controversial.

483
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like

484
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
there are biological differences between men and women,

485
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
which is obviously true.

486
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But he'll say it in the context of a conversation

487
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
about the underrepresentation of women in government,

488
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
which implies...

489
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
what exactly?

490
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So how do you respond to this?

491
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing

492
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
against the obviously true statement,

493
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
or you have to guess at what he's implying,

494
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
in response to which he can accuse you

495
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
of misrepresenting him,

496
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
which is exactly what happened with the Cathy Newman interview.

497
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
The most famous moment where Peterson does this

498
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
is the notorious lobster argument.

499
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
So he starts by saying,

500
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
There's this idea.

501
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There's this idea that hierarchical structures

502
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy.

503
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies,

504
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years,

505
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
so checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists.

506
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
You're saying that we should organize our societies

507
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
along the lines of the lobsters.

508
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity

509
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures.

510
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The problem with that is that,

511
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,000
no one has ever said that every hierarchy

512
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
is the product of Western patriarchy.

513
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
This is such a massive straw man

514
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation

515
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
of Peterson suggested by Cathy Newman in this interview.

516
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,000
No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.

517
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Even the anarchists, whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies,

518
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies.

519
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies.

520
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender,

521
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
race, and economics within our own society,

522
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
to which the lobster case is a complete non sequitur.

523
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I mean, you could use Peterson's lobster argument

524
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
the same way he uses it

525
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
to justify literally any hierarchy or authority,

526
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
no matter how unjust.

527
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
You could be an 18th century Republican

528
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
arguing against the monarchy,

529
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
and the monarch could turn around and say,

530
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
well, hierarchies are inevitable.

531
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
God save the lobster queen.

532
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Oh dear God.

533
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
My lords.

534
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Ladies.

535
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
And those at life betwixt.

536
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Present rumors and Republican rumblings

537
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
amongst the rabble

538
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
have compelled us to summon you together.

539
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Let us remind you that nature

540
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
hath so made the lobster

541
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
that some individuals be stronger than the others.

542
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Therefore, let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty

543
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
be anywise impugned.

544
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
And as for parliamentarians,

545
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:22,000
well, let them vote for cake.

546
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Very good. Thank you.

547
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I need new roommates.

548
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
So I've argued that Peterson is evoking

549
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
the incoherent concept of postmodern neo-Marxism

550
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
as the supervillain in a childishly simple worldview

551
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
he's promoting where these evil leftists

552
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
are out to destroy the West.

553
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Now, it's time to inspect the other side of this coin.

554
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
What, exactly, is the West?

555
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Well, there's an academic usage of the term the West

556
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
that describes the intellectual tradition

557
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that runs from ancient Athens to modern-day Europe and its colonies.

558
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Now, a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct

559
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
the whole concept of the West

560
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary

561
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
and supremacist and justifies imperialism

562
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
and all that kind of thing.

563
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
But we don't have time for that right now.

564
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
So I'm just gonna grant that the West is a thing

565
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it.

566
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
For Peterson,

567
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism, individualism,

568
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
the idea that each human has a spark of divinity,

569
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
and he therefore equates it with Judeo-Christian values,

570
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
a term more popular with conservative pundits

571
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
than intellectual historians.

572
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values

573
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
with postmodern neo-Marxism,

574
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
which he describes as anti-Western,

575
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
collectivist, relativist, and totalitarian.

576
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
This framing of a conflict of ideas

577
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
in terms of geographical chauvinism and external threat

578
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,000
is inaccurate and scaremongering.

579
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Marxism is Western philosophy.

580
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Postmodernism is Western philosophy.

581
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
If you're really concerned about preserving

582
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
the geographical boundaries of the intellectual tradition,

583
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,000
you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.

584
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Likewise, there is no feature of SJW ideology

585
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
that is meaningfully non-Western.

586
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The very idea of people requesting different pronouns

587
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
to suit their individual needs

588
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
is exactly the kind of thing

589
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
a person who values individual liberty

590
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
over collective dogma should be on board with.

591
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
You could even argue that Marxism

592
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy,

593
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
with its concern for human progress,

594
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
science, and liberty.

595
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Peterson

596
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
talk about the Western tradition,

597
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.

598
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,000
If you did read it,

599
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
you'd find a surprising diversity of thought

600
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
that doesn't reduce to Judeo-Christian values.

601
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
Much of Plato's political dialogues

602
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,

603
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
suggesting that,

604
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
far from being an invention of postmodernity,

605
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
it was actually a pretty popular worldview

606
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
among ancient Athenian pederasts.

607
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher David Hume

608
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
famously said that reason is,

609
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
and ought only to be,

610
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
the slave of the passions,

611
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
literally, feels over reals.

612
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
And meanwhile, his contemporary, the Marquis de Sade,

613
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
was advocating the abolition of morality,

614
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
filling the churches with scat porn,

615
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion

616
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
so decadent and depraved,

617
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube.

618
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,

619
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
and it's just as much a part of the West

620
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
as Peterson's soggy, Bible-padding conservatism.

621
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
But again, and I really can't stress this enough,

622
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I don't care either way.

623
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design.

624
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
So what do you people want from me?

625
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
The lobster queen is dead. Long live the queen.

626
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
TO BE CONTINUED

627
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:40,220
I think you would agree

628
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,720
that there's just a foundational erosion

629
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:44,180
that I think people of all sides,

630
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,260
and I think there's totally intellectually smart people

631
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,580
on the far left that can help.

632
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,060
Where are those people?

633
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,200
There's a YouTuber that I'm actually quite interested in

634
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,040
that I watch her, and I don't mean to misgender her

635
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:00,600
because I think she identifies with her, ContraPoints.

636
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,980
I don't know if you've heard of this YouTuber

637
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,140
who's on the far left.

638
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:04,680
I've seen the name come up every now and again on Twitter.

639
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,180
Totally disagree with everything this person says,

640
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,400
but I look at it and I'm like,

641
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,920
this seems very reasonable, educated,

642
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,200
academic, and I'm like,

643
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,260
and I'm seeing reasons to hope

644
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,420
that everyone's going to come together.

645
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,760
Hello, Dave.
