1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,060
All right, children. It's a new decade. It's time to face the facts. How do I put this

2
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:27,760
delicately? Your humble hostess is a total les. Shame. You're probably worried this

3
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:34,100
is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is, but oh, it's so much worse

4
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:40,080
than just that. You know, one, coming out may be regarded as a misfortune. Two, looks

5
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:44,660
like carelessness. And three, well, at that point, you're just doing it for attention.

6
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,380
And I do love attention. I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be

7
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:55,300
gay. Some gay people love attention. It's been known to happen. So there comes a time

8
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,520
in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself in the mirror, and

9
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,840
admit, this is some high-key, lesbicious behavior. And I'm going to talk you through how I got

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,660
to that point. So, story time, I fell in love with my best friend. Story time, telling my

11
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:16,360
boyfriend I'm a lesbian. Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang. Exposed,

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,340
graphic, the tea is piping hot. For a long time on this channel, the official story has

13
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,280
been that I'm bi. I'm a super fucking bi. But I haven't dated.

14
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,880
I haven't dated women since I transitioned. And for a while there, I got pretty deep into

15
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,720
the straight lifestyle. This really started in 2018. By that summer, I had privately convinced

16
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:41,960
myself that I was a fully heterosexual woman. And we're going to circle back to how I reached

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,460
that conclusion. But I'm starting in the middle of things. I'm like an epic poet.

18
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:52,400
Hail Muse. Hey, how are you, gorge? So at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends,

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,060
I'd even say best friends, with a woman whom

20
00:01:55,300 --> 00:02:03,900
I'll call Joanne. Light of my life. Can we get some melodramatic music, please? Yeah,

21
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,460
here we go. You're going to want to pour yourself a glass of something nice. I want you to fully

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:13,120
enjoy my pain. So my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast. It was that kind

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,600
of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and in-jokes, and you

24
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:21,260
drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter. We'd call each other

25
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:25,280
pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours. And I don't think I've ever called her and

26
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,920
not been laughing or smiling in the first 20 seconds, which is very unusual for me, because

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,120
I am a weird, and I don't get along that well with that many people. One reason we got so emotionally

28
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,480
close is we're both trans. And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that

29
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,000
I can share with another trans woman that I can't really have with anyone else. Oh, and by the way,

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,600
Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful, which I did notice every time I looked at her.

31
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,040
And from the beginning of this relationship,

32
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,300
it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly platonic either. We'd get drunk and make out. We'd sleep in

33
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:08,300
the same bed and cuddle. Straight girls do that, right? Gal pals. I remember one of the first times

34
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:12,440
I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together. And that night, we were bar hopping,

35
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,520
and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand, and we walked down the street together holding

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,640
hands. This is garbage, and I want to die. I hope you all know that I'm in agony. Later,

37
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,100
we were at a bar table with friends.

38
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,420
And every time one of us needed a drink, we'd run off to the bar, and she'd secretly kiss me.

39
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:34,700
Ah, it's still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.

40
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:39,860
Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care. A lot of men think girls kissing is hot,

41
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,740
but they don't take it seriously. They don't think it could ever mean anything or

42
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,140
lead to a real relationship. Gal pals. Just kill me. Take me out behind the shed,

43
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:55,060
put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before the kids get home, and they won't know,

44
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,740
I guess. So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to

45
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:06,440
Joanne or to myself that I was falling in love. So not only was I in denial about being in love

46
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:12,680
with her, but at the same time, I had basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.

47
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:18,980
So how could I possibly think that? Well, the short answer is shame. Why is no one talking

48
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:25,260
about the shame? I was so ashamed of my attraction to women. There were days I thought the shame was

49
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:30,860
going to crush me to death. Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad, and let no one say I didn't make

50
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,420
a strong attempt. There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in a town square with

51
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:42,240
the inscription, here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual. I'm a bronze star lesbian. Well,

52
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:48,240
if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star. Oh, I was desperate to be straight.

53
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:55,040
I tried prayer. I tried electric shocks. All the classics. All the hits. You know, the idea is,

54
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,600
if you shock yourself every time you think about women, you start to associate the two in your

55
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,620
head. So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks. This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel

56
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,860
like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett. So at some point, the shame was just too much for me,

57
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:15,760
and it literally broke my brain. I no longer wanted to be straight. I simply deluded myself

58
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:22,200
into thinking I was straight. Maybe a little bi. A little bi. By that time, I started dating men,

59
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,960
and I got into a serious long-term relationship,

60
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:28,960
with a man. And at first, I explained away my feelings for Joanne, by telling myself,

61
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,080
female friendships are just really intense. That's probably why I feel so strongly. And

62
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,600
everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I notice that. And, you know,

63
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:46,480
spend a lot of time thinking about it. So this nonsense went on until the beginning

64
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:52,080
of last year, and then two things happened. First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

65
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,800
Second, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian. Third, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

66
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,640
Fuck my drag, right? I think before that, I always knew she was bi, but

67
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,320
some combination of self-interested denial and biphobia allowed me to write off my initial

68
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,200
crush on her as, I just have a thing for my straight best friend. Like, who doesn't?

69
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,040
But that's a very self-serving narrative, because it quarantines your feelings inside

70
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:22,080
the safety of unattainable fantasy, and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.

71
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,720
Because that way, it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just,

72
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,840
she's just not that into women. But once she started dating women,

73
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,720
I couldn't tell myself that anymore. And the jealousy hit me so hard, I couldn't ignore it.

74
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,880
Second, around that same time, Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.

75
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,760
It was a long-distance friendship. And about halfway through that visit,

76
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,600
I cracked. One morning, I woke up next to her, and I looked at her pretty fucking face,

77
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,000
and I had the thought, I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.

78
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:01,680
And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual bio girl to have about her gal pal.

79
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone. Like, what the fuck is this?

80
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,520
What am I feeling? I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of

81
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,560
19th century Italian opera. So I confessed my feelings to Joanne, and love confession gone wrong,

82
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,520
devastating.

83
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,160
...

84
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,660
...

85
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:23,160
...

86
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,660
...

87
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,160
...

88
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,660
...

89
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,160
...

90
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,660
...

91
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,020
Nurse! My pain is at a 10, I need more pills!

92
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,700
Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah,

93
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,260
I'm sure we all know how that goes.

94
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:38,340
And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three-month friendship break right then and there,

95
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,020
I might have recovered. But we couldn't keep away from each other. She wasn't in love with me, but

96
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:49,380
she must have been in something with me, because the truth is, we were never just gal pals.

97
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,220
And I was beyond reason. Like, I probably would have started one of those

98
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,480
... lesbian couple joint Instagram accounts, that's how tragic this got. Those are great, by the way.

99
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,000
Pay no attention to bitter queens.

100
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,480
So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other, and I just repeated this

101
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:10,880
heartbreak again and again and again. Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have

102
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:15,720
come out as gay last year, because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating

103
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,200
shame. But rejection and heartbreak are shameful in themselves, and only made the situation worse.

104
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,220
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of bed with Joanne, and I was like, what the fuck is going on?

105
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,320
I was like, what the fuck is going on? I was like, what the fuck is going on? I was like, what the fuck is going on?

106
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:27,560
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial, until finally, last October, I got super

107
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:32,280
fucking cancelled on Twitter as discussed in my last video. Link in the description! Subscribe!

108
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,600
And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was going to have to be the one to enforce a

109
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:41,000
friendship break, otherwise I was never going to get over her. So there was this combination of

110
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,200
things, being politically cancelled by Twitter, being romantically cancelled by Joanne, and also

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,600
losing her as my closest friend, which sent me into this catatonic,

112
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,300
rock-bottom,

113
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:56,360
kind of depression. And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a

114
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,280
purpose. Because depression brings your life to a standstill, and in the quiet of that standstill,

115
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:06,920
you sometimes feel outside yourself. And with that, comes a new perspective.

116
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,840
So last December, when I was lying around drinking White Claw all day and

117
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:16,280
binge-watching Orange is the Bluest L Word, I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.

118
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,520
And that gave me a new kind of clarity. I looked back on the last couple years,

119
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:26,440
and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious. So that's what it took for me to finally face the

120
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,480
fact that I am a, uh… I am a gay, not clickbait.

121
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,420
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,420
No, no.

123
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,420
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,420
You're not.

125
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,420
You're not.

126
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,420
You're not.

127
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,420
You're not.

128
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,420
You're not.

129
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,420
You're not.

130
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,420
You're not.

131
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,420
You're not.

132
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,420
You're not.

133
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,420
You're not.

134
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,420
You're not.

135
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,420
You're not.

136
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,420
You're not.

137
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,420
You're not.

138
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.

139
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,520
Shame.

140
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,520
This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind

141
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,520
and a little more Coachella 2015.

142
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
Well that's my Eden.

143
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Candy flipping. I love it.

144
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,520
Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me

145
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,520
wound up in the clutches of the straight agenda.

146
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,520
It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.

147
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:26,520
First, there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.

148
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,520
Female friendships are just really intense.

149
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,520
Straight girls have girl crushes too.

150
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,520
And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought

151
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,520
was sexual and romantic attraction to men.

152
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,520
And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.

153
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,520
Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video,

154
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,520
but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame will overpower me again

155
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,520
and I'll slide back into denial.

156
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,520
So, while I'm still here,

157
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,520
still thinking semi-clearly,

158
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,520
let me talk you through the struggle.

159
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,520
Because, like most queer people,

160
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:58,520
I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis of my own personality.

161
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,520
She's a Libra.

162
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,520
So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.

163
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,520
And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that,

164
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
like, it makes you grow breasts.

165
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
At least, in theory.

166
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,520
I just added progesterone, we'll see if that does anything.

167
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:16,520
But the lesser known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your sexuality.

168
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,520
The first few months I was on hormones,

169
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,520
I didn't know if I was now asexual

170
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,520
because the libido I had known before was just gone.

171
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,520
But I'm very much not asexual.

172
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:32,520
It just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically female sex drive.

173
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,520
One of the differences for me is

174
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:37,520
it's not as obvious now whomst I'm attracted to.

175
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:39,520
Just looking at an attractive person,

176
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
well, let's put it this way,

177
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,520
it sparks my interest,

178
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
but it doesn't light my fire.

179
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:48,520
It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.

180
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,520
It's a slow burn that has to be built up.

181
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Some people call this demisexual,

182
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,520
which is a term I'm ambivalent about,

183
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,520
but I think the concept it describes applies to me.

184
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,520
Like, I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,

185
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,520
but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone

186
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,520
until I've gotten close to them as a friend.

187
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,520
So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?

188
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,520
Can't I just find a new best friend,

189
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,520
fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay married?

190
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
I know that's not how it works.

191
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I have to play the field.

192
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,520
I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.

193
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,520
Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.

194
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,520
It's boring.

195
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,520
The buildup of desire, that's the interesting part,

196
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,520
and the struggle between desire and shame.

197
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,520
I shouldn't, but I want to.

198
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,520
That's how you build a plotline, kids.

199
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,520
I'm also guessing this kind of slow burn sexuality

200
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,520
is more common in women than men.

201
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,520
And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men

202
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:49,520
tend to know they're gay at an earlier age than gay women.

203
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
When you have teenage boy testosterone levels,

204
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,520
it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about who you're attracted to.

205
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,520
Whereas, there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're gay

206
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
until they're in their 30s or even later.

207
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,520
And thank God for them!

208
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,520
They make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.

209
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,520
So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest

210
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
as a guide to my sexuality.

211
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Because I do feel aesthetic attraction towards beautiful people of any gender,

212
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
and that can be pretty intense in its own right.

213
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I guess the difference for me is

214
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,520
looking at a beautiful woman

215
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,520
is more emotionally captivating to me

216
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
than looking at a beautiful man.

217
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,520
Which can be moving in its own way,

218
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:29,520
but it's more like the way I'm moved by,

219
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I don't know,

220
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,520
the Parthenon.

221
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
You know, it's sturdy,

222
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,520
symmetrical,

223
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,520
has impressive columns.

224
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,520
That's not to say it's totally asexual.

225
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,520
I mean, I'd fuck the Parthenon.

226
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
I'd fuck it so hard.

227
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,520
I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity,

228
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:47,520
and maybe that stems from my pre-transition sense

229
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,520
of having failed at masculinity,

230
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,520
so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.

231
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,520
There's something about the contrast

232
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,520
between me and a masculine man

233
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,520
that's sexually intriguing to me.

234
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,520
Like I've sometimes pleasantly gasped

235
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:05,520
at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms

236
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,520
enfolding my smooth, fragile body.

237
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,520
Or maybe it's more Freudian,

238
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,520
the masculine man as Daddy,

239
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,520
the archetypal father,

240
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,520
the symbolic power of the phallus.

241
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,520
Penetration is the ultimate expression of desire and possession.

242
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,520
There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood,

243
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,520
and I think that's why I can look at a sexy man

244
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,520
and create plausible fantasies in my head

245
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,520
where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do things to me.

246
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,520
And I can find things I like about male bodies,

247
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,520
like they're very warm.

248
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,520
I love it when you get under the covers with a man

249
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
and he warms you up.

250
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head

251
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,520
and she says,

252
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,520
but are you attracted to men?

253
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Or do you just like being warm?

254
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,520
My attraction to women is very different.

255
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,520
I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like,

256
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,520
oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.

257
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:58,520
This is going to destroy me.

258
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,520
You know, it can actually be painful

259
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,520
how beautiful a woman is.

260
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,520
I've never once been in pain over male beauty,

261
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,520
but around Joanne,

262
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
once I was open about my feelings and things got bad,

263
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,520
there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her

264
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,520
and be like, don't even enter my line of sight right now.

265
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,520
You're too beautiful, I can't stand it.

266
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,520
There's a kind of sick masochism

267
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,520
in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.

268
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
It's insatiable, like an addiction.

269
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,520
And on the flip side,

270
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,520
there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.

271
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
I think that's what got me interested in men

272
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
in the first place.

273
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,520
It's that they're interested in me.

274
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,520
And that's pretty interesting.

275
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,520
I've felt desired by men

276
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.

277
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,520
You know, a man will glower at you

278
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
with that agitation,

279
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
agitated, carnivorous desperation.

280
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,520
Fuck me up, King.

281
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
God, that's hot.

282
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,520
Gets me every time.

283
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,520
But notice how excitement at the attention,

284
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,520
the flattery of being desired,

285
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,520
is not the same thing as attraction to men.

286
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:00,520
You know, there's a difference between I want you

287
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,520
and I like that you want me.

288
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,520
But for a long time, I confused one for the other.

289
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
And one reason I was able to do that

290
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:10,520
is that the normative sexual role for women

291
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,520
is to be pursued, possessed, desired,

292
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,520
seduced, dominated by men.

293
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
It's all very passive.

294
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,520
And in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,

295
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
I've taken a very submissive role.

296
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Sometimes I just submit to the glower

297
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
and let them do things to me.

298
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
And I do think that the thrill of being desired

299
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
is a valid thing to want.

300
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,520
I like that feeling myself,

301
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,520
and I do genuinely enjoy taking on

302
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,520
a more submissive role sometimes.

303
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
But you have to go about it thoughtfully.

304
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Because if you don't,

305
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,520
sexual submission can be a way to avoid

306
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,520
confronting what your desires actually are.

307
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,520
It's freedom from freedom.

308
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation,

309
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,520
and ashamed of your transsexual body,

310
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,520
and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all

311
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:02,520
because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,

312
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,520
then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires

313
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
by letting someone else take control

314
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
can be the only way

315
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
you can enjoy sex at all.

316
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
And for a while,

317
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.

318
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,520
And I was able to convince myself that was normal

319
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:20,520
because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women

320
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
isn't really that much more liberated.

321
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago

322
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
and totally identified with the fantasy.

323
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,520
And later,

324
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,520
I thought that was evidence

325
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:32,520
I had normative female desires.

326
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Never mind that I was identifying

327
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
with the midlife crisis fantasies

328
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
of a repressed English housewife,

329
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,520
longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.

330
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
I mean, not to shame women

331
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,520
who genuinely do enjoy a healthier version of that fantasy,

332
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
I think a lot of women

333
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,520
pointlessly suffer under a kind of feminist guilt about that.

334
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:52,520
But what makes me different is that for me,

335
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,520
submission to a man

336
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,520
was simply the only way I could enjoy sex without shame.

337
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,520
And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,

338
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,520
even though my real sexual attraction is to women.

339
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,520
Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,

340
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,520
straight women are,

341
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,520
ultimately attracted to men,

342
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,520
and sexually aroused by male bodies.

343
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Or are they?

344
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Gay men certainly are,

345
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,520
and gay women are just rhapsodic about women.

346
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,520
But a lot of straight women are just kind of,

347
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,520
meh,

348
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,520
about male bodies and men in general.

349
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
Which,

350
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
what is that about?

351
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
I just,

352
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,520
I just,

353
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
do not understand straight women.

354
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,520
I don't think I ever will,

355
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,520
and that's okay.

356
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment

357
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,520
and move on with my lesbian life.

358
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
Now,

359
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,520
what I've been giving you so far

360
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
is a retrospective analysis,

361
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,520
an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.

362
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
But you have to understand

363
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
that when I was living through this,

364
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
I experienced it very differently,

365
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
because I didn't have these insights.

366
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
So I wasn't thinking,

367
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,520
oh, I'm not really attracted to men,

368
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,520
but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,

369
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,520
so I'm gonna pursue that

370
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
to distract myself from how ashamed I am

371
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:01,520
of my attraction to women.

372
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,520
No.

373
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Subconsciously,

374
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
I put my attraction to women on mute.

375
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,520
At least,

376
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,520
Joanne ruined my life.

377
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,520
And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,

378
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:13,520
which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.

379
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,520
I had a serious long-term boyfriend

380
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,520
for a year and a half,

381
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,520
who I had very genuine feelings for.

382
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,520
Plot twist,

383
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
story time.

384
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,520
So,

385
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
my ex-boyfriend,

386
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
let's call him

387
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
Chad.

388
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,520
Oh, and he was a Chad.

389
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,520
Like,

390
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
full Giga-Chad fantasy.

391
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,520
You know, he was very masculine,

392
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,520
taller than me,

393
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,520
objectively attractive,

394
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,520
very charming.

395
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
Straight women used to tell me all the time

396
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,520
they were jealous of me for being with him,

397
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,520
and obviously I loved that.

398
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
To me,

399
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Chad represented

400
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,520
almost an ideal of manhood,

401
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,520
a sort of archetypal romantic lead

402
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,520
who swept me off my feet

403
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
and fulfilled my sick fantasies

404
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
of being a heterosexual woman.

405
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Now, you probably think I'm gonna say

406
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,520
that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,

407
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,520
but that once it came to actually dating,

408
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
I realized I didn't like it.

409
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
But honestly,

410
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:05,520
it's more complicated than that.

411
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Like, at the beginning,

412
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,520
I was the one who pursued him,

413
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
and I still think of him as the one

414
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,520
genuine boy crush of my life.

415
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,520
When we started dating,

416
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,520
it was really exciting.

417
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
I'd never had a boyfriend before,

418
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
and he'd never been with a trans woman before,

419
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,520
and we had this, like,

420
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
adorably heterosexual energy together,

421
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
like, holding hands in the park.

422
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
It was cute!

423
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,520
This would be a better lesbian story

424
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,520
if Chad was a Cad.

425
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,520
But he wasn't.

426
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,520
He was great.

427
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,520
He took very good care of me.

428
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,520
He was never ashamed to be seen,

429
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,520
or of his friends and family

430
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,520
knowing he was dating me,

431
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,520
which, if you're a trans woman,

432
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,520
that's a huge deal.

433
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,520
He was a lot less ashamed of me

434
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
than I am of myself.

435
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,520
And when I was with him,

436
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
I wasn't ashamed.

437
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,520
And that meant a lot.

438
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,520
So I really wanted this to work.

439
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,520
Like, if I was gonna be with a man,

440
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,520
he was the one.

441
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,520
And for a year or so,

442
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
I thought it was working.

443
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,520
I enjoyed the time we spent together.

444
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
I missed him when he was gone.

445
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:07,520
I told him I loved him,

446
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,520
and I meant it.

447
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
But what happened is,

448
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
by the end of the first year,

449
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,520
the initial excitement had died down.

450
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,520
And while Chad was ready

451
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,520
to keep escalating the relationship,

452
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
I was realizing that

453
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,520
something was very seriously,

454
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,520
emotionally wrong on my end.

455
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,520
There was something missing.

456
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,520
And when I realized

457
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,520
I was in love with Joanne,

458
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
I was like,

459
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,520
there's that missing feeling.

460
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,520
And I started to understand

461
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,520
what my problem was.

462
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:36,520
Then, last fall,

463
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,520
I posted to Instagram

464
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,520
an aloof picture of me

465
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
with the caption,

466
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,520
do I actually like men?

467
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
Or do I just like attention?

468
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,520
And I didn't mean anything serious by that.

469
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,520
I was just joking around.

470
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,520
You know, you can post something like that,

471
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,520
and a bunch of straight women will respond like,

472
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,520
yeah, fuck men.

473
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,520
What is their damage?

474
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
Well, they're stuck dating men.

475
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:57,520
That's their damage.

476
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
But a few people left comments saying,

477
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,520
oh, are you making a video about comphet?

478
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,520
You should make a video about comphet.

479
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,520
And I was like,

480
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,520
what the fuck is comphet?

481
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
So I Googled it,

482
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
and I learned that comphet is short

483
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,520
for compulsory heterosexuality.

484
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,520
Basically, it's the idea

485
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,520
that heterosexuality is socially required of women.

486
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,520
And it's so bound up with the conventional idea

487
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,520
of what it even means to be a woman

488
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,520
that gay women often mistakenly believe

489
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:27,520
for years that they're attracted to men.

490
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
And this Google search led me to a Reddit post

491
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?

492
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
And I'm reading through this post like,

493
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:38,520
oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.

494
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:39,520
Quote,

495
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,520
compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head

496
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,520
that says I must really be het

497
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
even when I'm in love with a woman.

498
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,520
Quote,

499
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,520
you have every reason to be happy

500
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,520
in your relationship with a man,

501
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,520
but you just aren't.

502
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,520
Everything is going really well,

503
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,520
but something is missing

504
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,520
and you can't figure out what.

505
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,520
So next thing you know,

506
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,520
I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.

507
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,520
and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes

508
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,520
that were clearly designed for 13 year olds.

509
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,520
And I'm fully a 31 year old transsexual

510
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
taking this quiz like,

511
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,520
it's true, Samantha was right,

512
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,520
I am a total les.

513
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,520
All the cis gay people watching this video

514
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
probably want to kill me right now

515
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
because y'all figured this shit out in high school

516
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,

517
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,520
it's just, I just, I just can't, I just.

518
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,520
Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay

519
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,520
for 30 minutes of my lifetime, please?

520
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,520
Is it all right with you, the gays?

521
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
So to be honest,

522
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,520
I still experience comphet thoughts and fantasies.

523
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,520
Like for a long time,

524
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,520
I've had what seemed to be romantic fantasies

525
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,520
about marrying a man.

526
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,520
But after a lot of introspection,

527
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,520
I've realized that this is not really a fantasy

528
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,520
of private happiness and fulfillment.

529
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,520
It's a fantasy of a social prestige and acceptance.

530
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Like, can you imagine if I got married

531
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,520
to a tall, handsome man

532
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,520
at an opulent wedding

533
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,520
with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?

534
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:03,520
Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.

535
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
I'd be super heckin' valid, uwu.

536
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,520
But I don't actually want to be married.

537
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
I want to get married.

538
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,520
I want to have a wedding.

539
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
Basically, I want to wear a wedding dress.

540
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,520
I want attention, okay?

541
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,520
Please, pay, pay attention to me.

542
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,520
So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy,

543
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,520
but it's still really hard for me to let it go.

544
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,520
I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality

545
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,520
because there's a level

546
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,520
of gender instability and deviancy

547
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
that's inherent to homosexuality.

548
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
And until recently,

549
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:37,520
I wasn't secure enough in my gender to handle that.

550
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,

551
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,520
and I think I needed to go through

552
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,520
the more one-on-one straight girl experience

553
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,520
before attempting anything as difficult as that.

554
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
I still have a hard time imagining

555
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,520
a happy future for myself

556
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,520
as a woman partnered to a woman.

557
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,520
And I think that's partly because

558
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,520
good lesbian representation in media

559
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,520
is so sparse.

560
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,520
The best we have is a Showtime melodrama

561
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,520
from 15 years ago,

562
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,520
which I do like,

563
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,520
and I like the new one too.

564
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,520
But after that,

565
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:07,520
the runner-up is,

566
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,520
I mean,

567
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,520
maybe not the lesbian representation we need.

568
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
It's a YouTube show about two drag queens

569
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
whomst we ship.

570
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
Well, I don't ship them,

571
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,520
because I have a fully lesbian

572
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,520
parasocial internet crush

573
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
on Katya Zamolochkova.

574
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
Don't laugh at me.

575
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
She's smart.

576
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
She's funny.

577
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
She's beautiful.

578
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,520
That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.

579
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
Sure, some haters and losers

580
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,520
will probably try to convince me

581
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,520
that Katya is in fact a homosexual man

582
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
posing as a woman,

583
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,520
but you know what?

584
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life,

585
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,520
and I don't need this right now.

586
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,520
I need to be touched by a real woman.

587
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
I'm losing my goddamn mind.

588
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,520
It's so deeply embedded in our culture

589
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,520
that marrying a man

590
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
is the end goal of womanhood.

591
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,520
And it's not just Disney movies,

592
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,520
like, it's the Bible,

593
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:54,520
it's Greek mythology,

594
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
American fairy tales,

595
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Victorian novels.

596
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,520
The whole weight of cultural history

597
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,520
is telling you

598
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,520
that what it means to succeed as a woman

599
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
is to marry a man.

600
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,520
And if you're already super dysphoric

601
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,520
and insecure about your gender,

602
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,520
then to reject that possibility?

603
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,520
Ah, it hurts.

604
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,520
It hurts so bad.

605
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,520
But whenever I think about

606
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,520
having a long-term partner,

607
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,520
you know, not the wedding day,

608
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
but the 1000th morning waking up together,

609
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
I can only imagine her being a woman.

610
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,520
My brain wants a good man

611
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,520
to take care of me.

612
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,520
But my heart wants a high-maintenance diva

613
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
to ruin my life.

614
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,520
And once I knew that for sure,

615
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,520
I thought it would be wrong to stay with Chad.

616
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,520
And this man was like my hinge.

617
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,520
He was holding me together.

618
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,520
But last December,

619
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,520
I broke up with him

620
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,520
because I'm a lesbian,

621
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,520
which at least is a good reason.

622
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,520
I'm having a hard time, you guys.

623
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,520
Leave your pity in the comments.

624
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:00,520
And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too.

625
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
I feel like shit.

626
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,520
I think it's the loss of my immortal soul

627
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,520
weighing on me.

628
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:05,520
I could really use a couple Advil

629
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
and a vodka tonic.

630
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,520
I think I might throw some clothes on, too.

631
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,520
Where's that snake?

632
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,520
I already miss my heterosexual nails.

633
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,520
I know these are too long to be gay,

634
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,520
but baby steps, okay?

635
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
This is hard for me.

636
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,520
Getting my acrylics removed?

637
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,520
Traumatizing.

638
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,520
I feel like I'm detransitioning.

639
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,520
One of these days,

640
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
I will do the lesbian manicure

641
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
with acrylics on eight fingers.

642
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,520
I just have to find the courage

643
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,520
to walk into a salon and say,

644
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,520
Hi, I'm a homosexual, please.

645
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,520
I want two short nails

646
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,520
so I can fuck pussy.

647
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
Shame.

648
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Let's talk about the shame.

649
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,520
Before I was transgendered,

650
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,520
I really only dated women,

651
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
though two of those women

652
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
later turned out to be trans,

653
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
so I guess we had some way

654
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,520
of finding each other.

655
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,520
An attraction to women

656
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,520
was never really a problem for me

657
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
before the transgendering

658
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,520
because I was raised

659
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,520
in an alternative lifestyle

660
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
where men are supposed

661
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
to be attracted to women.

662
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,520
Crazy, I know.

663
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,520
Not that I'm a newcomer to shame,

664
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,520
because, oh, sweaty?

665
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I was doing plenty of things

666
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,520
that men are not supposed to do.

667
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Before I transitioned,

668
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
my shame was centered around

669
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
my being, at the time,

670
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
a gender nonconforming man,

671
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
which, in my early YouTube videos,

672
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,520
I dealt with by caricaturing myself

673
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
and basically leaning in

674
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
to the public humiliation.

675
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,520
One of my classic techniques.

676
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,520
But now, my shame is centered around

677
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,520
my failure to be a socially acceptable woman.

678
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,520
And the most glaring aspects

679
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,520
of that failure are

680
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
my male past,

681
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
my sexual orientation,

682
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
and the severed human heads

683
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
in my refrigerator.

684
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,520
Yeah, killing all those people

685
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,520
was not my most feminine moment,

686
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,520
but I was having a bad skin day.

687
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
What was I supposed to do?

688
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
So there's two problems

689
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,520
that kind of multiply together.

690
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
One, I'm ashamed of being trans.

691
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.

692
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:01,520
And whatever one times two is,

693
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,520
I'm really ashamed

694
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,520
of being a trans lesbian.

695
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Ugh.

696
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,520
And it's difficult and risky

697
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,520
for me to admit these feelings,

698
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
because visible queer people

699
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
are supposed to perform pride.

700
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Why is no one talking about the shame?

701
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Because we are ashamed of the shame.

702
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,520
But we shouldn't be.

703
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,520
The shame is a natural result of shaming.

704
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,520
I grew up in a media era

705
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,520
when trans women were usually represented

706
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,520
as vomit-inducing monstrosities

707
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,520
who deserve the violence

708
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
they bring upon themselves by existing.

709
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
And I started my transition

710
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,520
in the first year of the Trump administration

711
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,520
when there's been constant vilification

712
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,520
of trans people in the press.

713
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
Invading women's bathrooms,

714
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
forcing our insanity on children,

715
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,520
destroying Western civilization

716
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,520
with our authoritarian pronouns.

717
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
It's hard to express just

718
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
the daily humiliation

719
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
of being a trans woman under these conditions.

720
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
And then there's the little jabs people throw at you,

721
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,520
like my laser technician recently told me,

722
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,520
you must be very courageous to transition

723
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,520
because that is not socially acceptable.

724
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,520
And then she went back to blasting laser beams

725
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,520
into my asshole.

726
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
And then there's the internet,

727
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
where, you know,

728
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,520
I used to spend most of my life

729
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
before the sadness took over.

730
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
And I'm sure we all know

731
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
that people on the internet

732
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
are a wretched, wretched horde

733
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,520
of bigoted attack helicopters.

734
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
The whole point of this channel

735
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,520
is I try to talk sense to these people.

736
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,520
I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives

737
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
and I try to empathize with their point of view

738
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,520
and provide a rational response.

739
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
But a side effect of all that research

740
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,520
is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary

741
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
of self-loathing.

742
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,520
It's seeped into my brain

743
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,520
and become a part of me.

744
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,520
And this lifelong buildup of shame

745
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,520
has become a wound

746
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
at the heart of my existence.

747
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
And all I can really do about it is

748
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,520
compensate by wearing fancy clothes.

749
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
I may be trash,

750
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,520
but I am a genius.

751
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,520
I am majestic trash.

752
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,520
I am resplendent trash.

753
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
I am couture trash.

754
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,520
And I just bought

755
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,520
a mid-century gold-trimmed

756
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,520
Venetian blown glass decanter,

757
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,520
which helps me forget

758
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,520
the shame and self-loathing

759
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,520
that plagues my every moment.

760
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,520
Now, I'm guessing

761
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,520
that a lot of people will be confused

762
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
about why I'm so ashamed of being gay

763
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,520
when I've already come out as trans,

764
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,520
which seems like a bigger deal.

765
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,520
To paraphrase what some people have told me,

766
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
you're already a transgendered

767
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
and a freak's a freak,

768
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
so who cares what kind of freak?

769
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Well, first of all,

770
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,520
I would like to propose

771
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:23,520
a sociological theory.

772
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
Tiffany's Law.

773
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
All freaks

774
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,520
have a deep psychological need

775
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
to feel superior

776
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,520
to a different type of freak.

777
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,520
And trans lesbians

778
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
are pretty close to the bottom

779
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
of that packing order.

780
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Who's even left for me

781
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
to feel superior to?

782
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
The goddamn Belgians?

783
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Fuck this waffle.

784
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
Second,

785
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
coming out as trans

786
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
wasn't as hard for me

787
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
because I did it incrementally

788
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:45,520
over like eight years.

789
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:46,520
At first,

790
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
I was like,

791
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
well,

792
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
I'm just a man

793
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
who wears makeup sometimes.

794
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Then I was like,

795
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
actually,

796
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
it's not just clothes and makeup.

797
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
I'm actually pretty gender nonconforming

798
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
in a lot of ways.

799
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,520
And then I realized

800
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
I'm not a man at all

801
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:58,520
and I identified as nonbinary.

802
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Then I started taking hormones.

803
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
In two months on HRT,

804
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
I woke up one day and said,

805
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,520
it's fine.

806
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,520
I am literally a woman.

807
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
So by the time

808
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
I actually came out

809
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
as a trans woman,

810
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,520
that was actually a step up

811
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
in terms of social acceptability

812
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
from where I was before.

813
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,520
When I was a genderqueer genderfuck,

814
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,520
I felt like

815
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
I didn't fit in anywhere.

816
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,520
Whereas

817
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:18,520
when I started transitioning

818
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,520
to female,

819
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
even though at first

820
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
I had a lot of the same problems,

821
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
there was at least

822
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,520
a goal in mind,

823
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,520
some possible future

824
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,520
where I could lead

825
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
a normal-ish life as a woman.

826
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,520
So the moment

827
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
I started identifying

828
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,520
as a woman

829
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
was the moment

830
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,520
the compet voice

831
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
entered my head.

832
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
Sure,

833
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
I've never been very attracted

834
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
to men before,

835
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
but maybe I'm attracted

836
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
to them now.

837
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
I'm a woman, right?

838
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
I've always been

839
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
a little bi-curious

840
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
and there was that time

841
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,520
I kissed a boy

842
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,520
when I was drunk.

843
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,520
Let's choose some boys

844
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,520
to be attracted to

845
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,520
and get started on this.

846
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Of course,

847
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
I wasn't as self-aware

848
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
as that.

849
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,520
My way of explaining it

850
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
to myself was,

851
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
I guess,

852
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
hormones just magically

853
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:56,520
changed my sexual orientation

854
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
to the socially acceptable one.

855
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
That's super friggin crazy.

856
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,520
Shut up,

857
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,520
you goddamn lesbo.

858
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
God,

859
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
there's so much pressure

860
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
on trans women

861
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
to be extremely

862
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,520
gender conforming,

863
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
and even more so

864
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
if you're a representative

865
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
of the community.

866
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
You feel like

867
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
you have to be

868
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
a Stepford wife

869
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
or else cis people

870
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
are gonna throw us all

871
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
in camps.

872
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
And early in my transition,

873
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
I kind of worshipped

874
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
straight trans women.

875
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Like,

876
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
I looked up to them

877
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
and I wanted to be

878
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
just like them.

879
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
Now back then,

880
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
there were a handful

881
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
of trans lesbians

882
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
on YouTube

883
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
trying to make the case

884
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
to the masses

885
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
that being a trans lesbian

886
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
is a legitimate thing.

887
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
But in 2017,

888
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
sweaty,

889
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,520
the masses

890
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,520
were not having it.

891
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,520
I watched those women

892
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:35,520
get eaten alive.

893
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
And as a result

894
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
of my witnessing that

895
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
at a super fucking

896
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
vulnerable moment for me,

897
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
I internalized the message

898
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
that a trans lesbian

899
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
is just

900
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
not an okay

901
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
thing to be

902
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,520
if you want to be tolerated

903
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,520
or respected

904
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
by anybody other than

905
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
a handful of communists.

906
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
So I began my transition

907
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,520
with essentially

908
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
no role model

909
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,520
of a widely respected

910
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,520
and admired

911
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
trans lesbian.

912
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
And it doesn't help

913
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
that most forms

914
00:33:58,520 --> 00:33:59,520
of transphobia

915
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,520
are harsher

916
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
on gay trans women

917
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,520
than they are

918
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,520
on straight trans women.

919
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Like take this trope

920
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
that trans women

921
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
are men

922
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
who transition

923
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
to creep on women

924
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
in bathrooms.

925
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
In response to that,

926
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:11,520
it feels really good

927
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
to be able to say

928
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,520
I'm not even attracted

929
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,520
to this petite

930
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,520
heterosexual bio girl.

931
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
I'm surely not

932
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
some kind of

933
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
six foot monster

934
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
who likes women.

935
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Shame.

936
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
Shame.

937
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
It does make me feel

938
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
like a monster sometimes,

939
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,520
like a mutant

940
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,520
that has no place

941
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
in society.

942
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,520
And this shame

943
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:29,520
has actually made it

944
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
more difficult

945
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
for me to accept

946
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
that I'm a gay woman

947
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
than it was for me

948
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
to come out as trans

949
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
in the first place.

950
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
It's like I made

951
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
a kind of subconscious

952
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
bargain

953
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
where I traded

954
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
my sexual orientation

955
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
for my gender identity.

956
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
So I finally transitioned

957
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
only to spend

958
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
a different kind

959
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,520
of denial.

960
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,520
And that denial

961
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
got pretty deep

962
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
and pretty dark.

963
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
This is painful

964
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
and incriminating

965
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
to admit,

966
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
but not all of my shame

967
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
came from external bigotry.

968
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
Some of it came

969
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,520
from my own judgment

970
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,520
and disgust

971
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
toward things

972
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,520
I saw trans lesbians

973
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
doing.

974
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,520
Like this anime

975
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,520
cat girl shit

976
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
which clearly

977
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
gets under my skin

978
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,520
and not just because

979
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
these people

980
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
have been harassing me

981
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:07,520
for three years.

982
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Like you see it

983
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,520
all over trans Twitter

984
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,520
and Reddit,

985
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,520
this queasy combination

986
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
of the hypersexual

987
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,520
and the infantile.

988
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
I'm a heckin'

989
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
cat girl lesbian

990
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
cum slut.

991
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
Meow meow,

992
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,520
girl dick,

993
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
nya nya.

994
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,520
Here's the 97th picture

995
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,520
of my own legs

996
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
and thigh-high

997
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
stripey socks uwu.

998
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
What is that about?

999
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Is this how women act?

1000
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,520
Cis people are gonna

1001
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,520
see this.

1002
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,520
They're not gonna

1003
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,520
let us into women's spaces

1004
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
if we act like that.

1005
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Now I'm not proud

1006
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,520
of having these

1007
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,520
judgmental feelings,

1008
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:35,520
but I confess

1009
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
to periodically

1010
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
sinking into

1011
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,520
these morbid

1012
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,520
guilty binges

1013
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,520
of cringing

1014
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
at embarrassing

1015
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
trans lesbians

1016
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
and if I was

1017
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,520
a different type

1018
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,520
of YouTuber

1019
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,520
I could've turned

1020
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,520
this into content.

1021
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,520
At my worst

1022
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,520
I would sit there

1023
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
telling another

1024
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
trans person

1025
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,520
why are trans lesbians

1026
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
so cringey

1027
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:54,520
they're making things

1028
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
harder for the rest

1029
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
of us girls.

1030
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,520
And that's

1031
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,520
the real darkness

1032
00:35:58,520 --> 00:35:59,520
isn't it?

1033
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Not even having

1034
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
the decency

1035
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
to openly

1036
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
despise yourself

1037
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,520
like an honest American.

1038
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,520
No,

1039
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
just sitting there

1040
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
in absurd denial

1041
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
of who you are

1042
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
as a person

1043
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,520
disparaging

1044
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
your own repressed

1045
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,520
identity to anyone

1046
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:13,520
I'm ashamed

1047
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,520
I sunk that low

1048
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
but all you can do

1049
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,520
is try to get better

1050
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,520
and I'm trying

1051
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,520
to get better

1052
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,520
I've broken free

1053
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,520
of the denial

1054
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,520
and now I have

1055
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
to break free

1056
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,520
of the shame

1057
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,520
because shame

1058
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
is literally

1059
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
ruining my life.

1060
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
I told Joanne

1061
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
I was working

1062
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
on a video

1063
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
about shame

1064
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,520
and she said

1065
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,520
I might want

1066
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
to mention

1067
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
that one of the reasons

1068
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,520
she didn't want

1069
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
to be with me

1070
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,520
is she'd be ashamed

1071
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,520
to date another

1072
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
trans woman.

1073
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,520
She said she feels

1074
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
like relationships

1075
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,520
are a freakish behavior

1076
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
on the outskirts

1077
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
of society

1078
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,520
with no attempt

1079
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,520
to integrate.

1080
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
These are very painful

1081
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,520
words to hear

1082
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
from the woman

1083
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,520
you're in love with

1084
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
but I understand

1085
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
why she feels

1086
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,520
that way.

1087
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,520
Joanne gets validation

1088
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,520
from dating cis men

1089
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,520
or cis women

1090
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,520
but I

1091
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,520
can't be the hinge

1092
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,520
that connects her

1093
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,520
to mainstream society

1094
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
and it's maddening

1095
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
to me that she feels

1096
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:03,520
that way

1097
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,520
because I would have

1098
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
chosen her

1099
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,520
over every cis woman

1100
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
in the world

1101
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
but I'm just another

1102
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,520
worthless freak

1103
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,520
without the authority

1104
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
of my love

1105
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,520
doesn't count.

1106
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Shame.

1107
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,520
It poisons

1108
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,520
the soul.

1109
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,520
You know who you love

1110
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,520
just like what gender

1111
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
you are

1112
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,520
is such a basic

1113
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,520
part of your humanity

1114
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,520
and shame

1115
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
about that

1116
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
cuts to the core

1117
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,520
of your being.

1118
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,520
It's not

1119
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
I'm ashamed

1120
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
of what I did

1121
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
it's not

1122
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,520
I'm ashamed

1123
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,520
of how I feel

1124
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
it's I'm ashamed

1125
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,520
of who and what

1126
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,520
I am

1127
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,520
and living

1128
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,520
in that state of mind

1129
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
is garbage

1130
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,520
it's basically

1131
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
hell.

1132
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,520
Even after I realized

1133
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
my sexuality

1134
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
shoving that shit

1135
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,520
back down

1136
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,520
never coming out

1137
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,520
I have all these

1138
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:45,520
fears about it

1139
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:46,520
I'm worried

1140
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,520
people will take my gender

1141
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
less seriously

1142
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
I'm worried

1143
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
cis women

1144
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
or straight women

1145
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
I'm friends with

1146
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,520
will get weird about it

1147
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,520
I'm worried

1148
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
I'll die a lonely

1149
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
useless lesbian

1150
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,520
in which case

1151
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
I should have just

1152
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
married a man

1153
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,520
cause at least then

1154
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,520
there'd be someone

1155
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,520
to kill the spiders

1156
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
and fix the fucking sink

1157
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
I'm worried

1158
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
I'll lose my straight male

1159
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,520
audience on YouTube

1160
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,520
although

1161
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,520
I mean

1162
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,520
love you boys

1163
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,520
I'll be fine

1164
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,520
without you

1165
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,520
and in any case

1166
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:13,520
when has a woman's

1167
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,520
being a lesbian

1168
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,520
ever stopped a man

1169
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,520
from taking a swing at it

1170
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:17,520
I actually thought about

1171
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,520
marrying a man anyway

1172
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:19,520
just sacrificing

1173
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
my sexual orientation

1174
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,520
to regain

1175
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
that safe

1176
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,520
comfortable

1177
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:24,520
shameless

1178
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:25,520
feeling

1179
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,520
I used to have

1180
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,520
when walking down the street

1181
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
holding Chad's hand

1182
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,520
feeling like I'd succeeded

1183
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
as a woman

1184
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,520
but if I don't deal

1185
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,520
with this now

1186
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,520
and work towards

1187
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,520
accepting myself

1188
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,520
then I'm just gonna be

1189
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,520
in the same situation

1190
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,520
in 10 years

1191
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,520
when I'm 41 years old

1192
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,520
and married to a man

1193
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,520
with the same feelings

1194
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:41,520
so it's time for this

1195
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,520
to stop

1196
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,520
because literally

1197
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
the only good thing

1198
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,520
about being gay

1199
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,520
is doing gay shit

1200
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,520
and as long as I'm ashamed

1201
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,520
of my sexuality

1202
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:49,520
no one's gonna wanna

1203
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,520
do gay shit with me

1204
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,520
as I like to say

1205
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:52,520
if you can't love yourself

1206
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:53,520
how in the hell

1207
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,520
are you gonna prop up

1208
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,520
your narcissistic delusions

1209
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:56,520
look I'm trying

1210
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,520
to stay positive

1211
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,520
maybe everyone hates

1212
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,520
trans lesbians now

1213
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,520
but just you wait

1214
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,520
we all know

1215
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,520
how trends work

1216
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,520
in 10 years

1217
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,520
being a trans lesbian

1218
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,520
will be the coolest

1219
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,520
hippest

1220
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,520
chicest

1221
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,520
thing imaginable

1222
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,520
and all the people

1223
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,520
who love it now

1224
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,520
will forget

1225
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,520
they ever said a word

1226
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,520
that's right

1227
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,520
even the straight trans girls

1228
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,520
will be making out

1229
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,520
with each other

1230
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,520
just for the clout

1231
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:18,520
like we can be lesbians

1232
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
too

1233
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,520
we are edgy

1234
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,520
oh

1235
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,520
it's gonna be

1236
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,520
Madonna and Britney

1237
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,520
at the 2003 VMAs

1238
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,520
all over again

1239
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
mark my words

1240
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,520
and among cis lesbians

1241
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,520
oh

1242
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
it will actually be

1243
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
a sign of prestige

1244
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,520
to have a trap waifu

1245
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:33,520
I can dream right

1246
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,520
once you've tasted

1247
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,520
one forbidden fruit

1248
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,520
why stop there

1249
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
because they'll be

1250
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,520
fine

1251
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,520
oh my god

1252
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:43,460
you've got a bomb

1253
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:43,520
nggak

1254
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,520
nothing can stop

1255
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,520
me

1256
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,520
gotta go

1257
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,520
you only do

1258
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
what you gotta do

1259
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,520
or else

1260
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:50,020
I'll fall

1261
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,520
and if it's

1262
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
really speed

1263
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
like where are you

1264
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,520
now

1265
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,520
then drive

1266
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,520
you home

1267
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,520
since I'm

1268
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,520
dead

1269
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:58,520
sorry

1270
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,520
I'll make it

1271
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
so we're

1272
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,520
not friends

1273
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,520
yeah

1274
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:03,520
right

1275
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,520
sorry

1276
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,520
something seems

1277
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,520
weird

1278
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
будем

1279
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,520
you sure

1280
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:39,500
Thank you.

1281
00:40:39,520 --> 00:41:09,500
Thank you.

1282
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:39,500
Thank you.

1283
00:41:39,520 --> 00:42:02,340
Thank you.
