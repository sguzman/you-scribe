1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,080
Sar, I'm going to talk about Joro once again, but first, story time.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,440
Chapter 1. Anita

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:19,840
The most famous spigot in American LGBT history is a woman called Anita Bryant. This is her story.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,840
1977 was not a good time to be gay. Is it ever really a good time to be gay?

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
In 1969, the Stonewall Riots forced gay rights into national consciousness.

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,760
The first pride parades were held in the summer of 1970, and in 1973 the American

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,920
Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,360
But only after gay activists disrupted their conference and shouted,

9
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,560
Gay conversion therapy is torture! We have abnormal urges and we will not be silenced!

10
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,400
Because that's the only way to get anything done in this country,

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
you have to be super annoying about it.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
They give you no choice.

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:08,560
On January 18th, 1977, Dade County, Florida, known for such popular cities as Miami,

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,480
approved a law that added the phrase,

15
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,880
Affectional or Sexual Preference to its non-discrimination ordinance,

16
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,840
effectively banning housing and employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.

17
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,840
And it was just then, as things seemed to be getting better,

18
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,480
that Anita Bryant made her little appearance.

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:29,680
Anita Bryant, Miss Oklahoma!

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,080
Anita Bryant is a native Oklahoman who once had a career as a pop singer,

21
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,280
beauty queen, and spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission.

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,120
Come to the Florida sunshine tree.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,040
My twins love 100% orange juice from Florida any time of day.

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,800
Orange juice from Florida! It isn't just for breakfast anymore!

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:55,680
Orange juice with natural vitamin C from the Florida sunshine tree.

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,320
She was known for these TV commercials with the tagline,

27
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
A day without orange juice.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,920
is like a day without sunshine.

29
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,520
Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.

30
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,160
Cute.

31
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:10,000
When Anita heard her pastor speak about this non-discrimination ordinance,

32
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,520
she felt a divine disturbance in her heart.

33
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
How touching.

34
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,920
According to the word of God, it's an abomination to practice homosexuality.

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,880
As a mother, she would not stand for this.

36
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:26,000
So Anita wrote a letter to the county commissioner saying,

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,160
As a concerned mother of four children,

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,000
I am most definitely against this.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Ordinance Amendment.

40
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,120
I have never condoned nor taught my children discrimination against anyone.

41
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,240
But if this ordinance amendment is allowed to become law,

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,680
you will in fact be infringing upon my rights

43
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,640
and discriminating against me as a citizen and a mother

44
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,480
to teach my children God's moral code as stated in the holy scriptures.

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,720
Anita, kill your shitty child.

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,720
When the amendment passed, Anita created a campaign for its repeal.

47
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,680
The Save Our Children Coalition, which sponsored provocative TV ads,

48
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,720
implying that gay people are degenerates who ruin communities and seduce children.

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,400
The campaign has been vicious.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,440
With television commercials, the Save Our Children group is appealing to parental anxieties,

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,600
saying gays will flaunt their homosexuality before impressionable children.

52
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,400
The Orange Bowl Parade, Miami's gift to the nation, wholesome entertainment.

53
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
But in San Francisco, when they take to the streets,

54
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,640
it's a parade of homosexuals, men hugging other men, cavorting with little boys.

55
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,520
Save Our Children.

56
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,080
Sparked the first organized backlash to gay rights in the United States,

57
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,040
escalating the conflict into a national controversy.

58
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,600
On one side were the gay rights activists,

59
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,720
who argued that non-discrimination was a matter of human rights.

60
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,040
On the opposing side, Anita Bryant argued that the non-discrimination ordinance

61
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,320
would give special privileges to homosexuals.

62
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,920
We all believe in human rights,

63
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,400
but we don't believe in human rights that would corrupt our children

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,880
or for individuals to have special privileges.

65
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,440
We all believe in human rights, but we don't believe in human rights that would corrupt our children or for individuals to have special privileges.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,960
That would go against the constitutional rights of normal America.

67
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,120
As long as they don't want to flaunt their homosexuality,

68
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,960
they have equal rights the same as anyone else.

69
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,760
In other words, gay people already have equal rights,

70
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,680
just as long as they stay in the closet and don't do anything gay.

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,000
That's very helpful.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,760
Thank you so much, Anita, for standing up for our right to be gay in secret.

73
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:28,640
As long as they do their job and do not want to come out of the closet and force their homosexuality

74
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,160
on me in the areas of business or in the schools,

75
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,240
they can live their life and we're not going out after their jobs

76
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,960
or trying to get them out of their teaching jobs or housing.

77
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,160
Anita also argued that allowing flaunting homosexuals to teach children

78
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,400
was tantamount to gay recruitment.

79
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,680
Just biologically that God made mothers so that we could reproduce.

80
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically,

81
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,720
but they have to reproduce by recruiting our children.

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
It's the exact same argument that's being used

83
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,040
today by right-wing politicians who claim that queer people are groomers.

84
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:09,120
Stop confusing our babies with your groomer gender ideologue.

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,640
This wicked book, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl,

86
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,400
sexually indoctrinated with wicked, vile books.

87
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,960
And she believes in traditional marriage between a man and a woman,

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,040
and in that book it talked about two moms.

89
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,400
Stay away from the children creep or you will regret it.

90
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,400
People should definitely arm themselves, I agree with that.

91
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,400
The Democrats are the party of pedophiles.

92
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,040
The Democrats are the party of teachers, elementary school teachers,

93
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,120
trying to transition their elementary school-aged children

94
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
and convince them they're a different gender.

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,680
They're just evil people and they want to groom kids.

96
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,520
They're recruiting.

97
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
If you don't know what furries are, it's where school children

98
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,440
dress up as animals, cats or dogs, during the school day.

99
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,760
They meow and they bark.

100
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,080
What a great country we live in.

101
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,400
I love it so much.

102
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,120
Gay people around the country rallied against Anita Bryant and Save Our Children.

103
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
There was a national boycott of Florida orange juice,

104
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,040
with many gay bars taking screwdrivers off the menu

105
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,920
and replacing them with an apple juice and vodka cocktail called an Anita Bryant.

106
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,040
Let's make one now.

107
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,400
Forgot my cocktail measure, so I'm just gonna have to eyeball this.

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,280
Just a dash of apple juice.

109
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,240
Give it a stir.

110
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,000
Needs a garnish.

111
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,500
Stir.

112
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,000
Stir.

113
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,500
Stir.

114
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,000
Stir.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,500
Stir.

116
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,120
Stunning.

117
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,560
I mean, it's not as good as a screwdriver, but if I was in the 70s,

118
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,400
I would have thrown back so many of these goddamn things out of pure spite.

119
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,680
There's a story that Troy Perry, the founder of the gay-affirming metropolitan community church,

120
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
was on a transcontinental flight, and when the attendant put a glass of orange juice on his tray,

121
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,880
he said,

122
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,080
TAKE THAT AWAY.

123
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,520
I'M A HOMOSEXUAL.

124
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,640
At Gay Pride marches in 1977 and 78, anti-Anita Bryant slogans featured prominently on t-shirts,

125
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,920
signs, and buttons.

126
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,160
Anita Bryant sucks oranges.

127
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,680
A day without lesbians is like a day without sunshine.

128
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,160
True.

129
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,320
And meanwhile, Anita's campaign inspired more anti-gay legislation,

130
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,880
including bans on gay adoption and same-sex marriage, both of which passed in the Florida

131
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,680
Senate, as well as the failed Briggs Initiative in California, which would have forced public

132
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
schools to fire gay teachers.

133
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,920
So Anita Bryant was worse than a bigot.

134
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,760
She was an influential bigot.

135
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,760
But she may also have helped to unify and galvanize gay activists,

136
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,080
by providing them with a common enemy.

137
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,240
According to historian Lillian Faderman,

138
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,800
Anita Bryant created fervent activists out of those who'd previously been content

139
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,120
simply to enjoy their newfound freedoms.

140
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,560
Faderman cites Eric Hoffer's observation that a mass movement can get along fine without a god,

141
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,880
but it won't get along at all without a devil.

142
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,960
For gay people all over the country, Anita Bryant became that devil.

143
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,000
I think that she is rallying the community together like I have never seen before.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
There's no way I could have done it on my own.

145
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:02,800
So even though she succeeded in her initial goal to repeal the non-discrimination ordinance,

146
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,120
there is no question that in the long term, Anita Bryant was the loser.

147
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,720
She took a lot of L's.

148
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,280
RIP.

149
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,640
That must be super hard for her.

150
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:15,040
For the short remainder of her career, gay activists protested her events,

151
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,840
they shut down the tour for her book about how persecuted she was by the militant homosexual,

152
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,600
and they succeeded in turning public opinion against Anita Bryant

153
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,680
to the point that she became virtually unemployable in mainstream entertainment.

154
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,040
It helped that she came across as kind of a judgmental prude,

155
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:35,040
that even hip straight people didn't want to be associated with.

156
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:40,320
Our top story tonight, Anita Bryant, former mediocre actress and orange juice promoter,

157
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:46,960
performed coitus in public yesterday, campaigned to promote heterosexuality.

158
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,760
We don't serve orange juice anymore.

159
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
Like she famously told Playboy magazine,

160
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,240
Why do you think the homosexuals are called fruits?

161
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,120
It's because they eat the forbidden fruit of the tree of life.

162
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,960
God referred to men as trees.

163
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,880
And because the homosexuals eat the forbidden fruit, which is male sperm.

164
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,160
Oh my God.

165
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,640
Like the woman is heterosexual cringe.

166
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,160
This is how you lose the culture war.

167
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,600
So let's all squeeze a fruit for Anita, pass a little juice around.

168
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,360
And of course, there was the famous incident where a gay activist

169
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,280
smashed a banana cream pie in Anita's face during a TV appearance.

170
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:26,960
And went into a place called Norfolk, Virginia, and were met with protest,

171
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,600
and, uh, um, all kinds of problems and, uh, uh, every security agent, security.

172
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,560
No, no, let him stay.

173
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,280
No, let him stay.

174
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,000
Well, at least it's a fruit pie.

175
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,800
Miami-Dade County finally reinstated the non-discrimination ordinance in 1998,

176
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,160
and they added gender identity to its protections in 2014.

177
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,560
In 2021, Anita took another metaphorical pie to the face.

178
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,160
When her granddaughter, Sarah Green, came out as gay,

179
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,200
she was the only one who had the courage to a woman in publicly struggling

180
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,920
with whether to even invite her grandmother to the ceremony.

181
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,920
It's very hard to argue with someone who thinks that, like,

182
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,800
an integral part of your identity is just, uh, an evil delusion.

183
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,640
That it is, Sarah. That it is.

184
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,040
So that's the story of Anita Bryant, as students of LGBT history know it.

185
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,440
But isn't it a bit one-sided?

186
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,080
Wasn't there a lot of toxicity on both sides?

187
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,040
Anita Bryant forces talk of absolute truth and morality.

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,160
Gay leaders are equally dogmatic about human rights.

189
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,600
A plague on both the houses.

190
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,960
Isn't it cruel, even, to slur Anita as a bigot and a homophobe?

191
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:45,040
In fact, isn't it possible that Anita Bryant was the real victim?

192
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,200
Oh no. Oh no!

193
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,240
I can't do this anymore.

194
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,960
I'm eating my pie.

195
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,920
I'm eating my goddamn pie.

196
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:56,480
I'm eating my goddamn pie.

197
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,120
Chapter Two.

198
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,760
The Witch Trials of Anita Bryant.

199
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,560
God help us all.

200
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,000
The mainstream media would have us believe that Anita Bryant is a so-called

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,800
homophobe, some kind of hateful bigot.

202
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,760
But isn't this just an authoritarian tactic used to silence valid concerns?

203
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,280
Mothers in this country are worried about their children going to school to be taught by perverts.

204
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,400
How can we be so sure that the militant homosexuals weren't the real bigots?

205
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,440
Isn't it possible, though?

206
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,280
Isn't it possible that Anita Bryant was the first victim of cancel culture?

207
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,240
Of, dare I say it, wokeism?

208
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,760
Well, no.

209
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,560
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

210
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,240
But suppose that you're an idiot.

211
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,960
And suppose that that's the narrative you wanted to promote.

212
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,800
Well, what would be your argument?

213
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,320
I mean, if someone put a gun to my head and forced me to make that argument,

214
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,720
I'd probably say something like this.

215
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,600
Anita Bryant lived a difficult life.

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,280
In 1940, she was born into brutal poverty in rural Oklahoma.

217
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,480
Her parents divorced when she was just two years old,

218
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
the same year she made her singing debut at the Baptist Church.

219
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,520
Parts of my childhood, I blocked out because it hurts too much.

220
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:09,280
I guess I was happiest when I was eight years old, and my parents were remarried,

221
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:12,720
and I was baptized and came to know Christ as my personal savior.

222
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,920
Her father abandoned the family again when she was 12.

223
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,280
It was real painful, and it just about killed my mother.

224
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,280
She was a very submissive wife.

225
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,080
She was too submissive, and it angered me.

226
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,280
She let my dad step up.

227
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,600
All over her because of him.

228
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,720
I think I went through life for a long time hating all men.

229
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,560
Anita described her most intense adolescent memory as a feeling of intense ambition,

230
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,720
a relentless drive to succeed at doing well.

231
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,440
The thing I loved.

232
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,120
But Anita's ambition conflicted with her submissive role as a traditional Christian woman.

233
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:58,320
In 1960, Anita married Bob Greene,

234
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,640
Miami's top disc jockey, but only after he relentlessly badgered her into it.

235
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,040
This is what heterosexuals do, fellas.

236
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,000
Greene was allegedly a controlling and abusive husband.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,080
Feminist Andrea Dworkin claims,

238
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:19,040
Greene manipulated Bryant with a cruelty nearly unmatched in modern love stories.

239
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,760
And Anita rationalized the abuse, saying,

240
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,800
Despite our sometimes violent scraps, I love him for it.

241
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,960
But while submitting to her husband

242
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,080
and raising four children, Anita was still able to build the career she'd always wanted.

243
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:37,120
By the 1970s, she was on the payroll of Big Orange Juice, earning half a million dollars

244
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,800
a year, enough to move her family into a 27-room Spanish mansion on Biscayne Bay.

245
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,240
So Anita Bryant struggled all her life for her success.

246
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:52,800
Did she really deserve to lose it all just because she took a stand for something she believed in?

247
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,720
Anita Bryant's role as a leader,

248
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,940
in the campaign against homosexuals may be hurting her campaign to sell orange juice are you being

249
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:05,640
blackballed well it's uh it's it looks that way it's it's worse than that we're being threatened

250
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,660
and uh there's all kinds of harassment even with my job with florida citrus i have been blacklisted

251
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:17,100
for exercising the right of a mother to defend her children and all children against their being

252
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:22,480
recruited by homosexuals her entire life had become a series of catastrophes she'd been dropped as

253
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,800
spokesperson by the orange growers she had been dropped as a commentator on the orange bowl parade

254
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,940
she lost a television show contract her bookings dropped drastically

255
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:47,000
no one has paid as dearly as nita bryant for taking a public stand on something she believed

256
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,460
in i remember lying in the bed in my my mother's house in a fetal position

257
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:58,200
and wanting to die gay activists in the 1970s didn't exactly limit their tactics to polite

258
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:08,880
debate in the free marketplace of ideas homosexuals started fighting back the gays formed new groups

259
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:14,400
and picketed the performers public appearances forcing her to cancel a few gay activists routinely

260
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:20,320
compared anita to adolf h they created pastiches of her orange juice slogan they blamed her for

261
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,280
hate crimes they burned her in

262
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:28,280
refugee they disrupted events she was involved in they printed toilet paper with her face on it

263
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:34,800
some sent anita death threats or they mailed her rotting oranges dead cockroaches human excrement

264
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,080
see this is how you cancelled people before phones instead of posting you would

265
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:45,120
simply mail actual human through the united states postal service neither snow nor rain nor

266
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:50,800
heat nor gloom of night anita's husband pleaded to supporters how would you men feel if you opened

267
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,440
a letter and there was a photo of her in the post office of the united states post office of the

268
00:15:52,440 --> 00:16:02,600
united states you can imagine quite a lot i do think it would be fair to say that a lot of the

269
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:08,600
rhetoric did take on a misogynistic tone lillian faderman recounts that lesbians particularly

270
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:14,360
lesbian feminists abhorred the sexist terms that were being used to characterize anita bryant

271
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:20,760
and gay men called her the harassment escalated to the point where anita had to cancel her book tour

272
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,280
due to demonstrations and bribes against anita bryant who had been a victim of sexual abuse in the United States.

273
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,280
bomb threats from gay activists and of course there was the pie

274
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,840
so much for the tolerant matashin society it's kind of a deep cut well something to entertain

275
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:38,200
the boomer queers gay activists claimed to stand for human rights but what about anita's right to

276
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:43,880
free speech i wish i had some literal pearls to clutch civil libertarian nat hentoff wrote in his

277
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,280
1992 book free speech for me but not for thee that the orange shoes boycott reminded him of a little

278
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,280
thing called mccarthyism

279
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:58,840
have you ever considered that being pro-gay is quite similar to being anti-gay and that both

280
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:05,640
are opinions as anita tells it she and her foot soldiers of god were the victims of sinister gay

281
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,760
carpetbaggers the foot soldiers were housewives and mothers religious and civic leaders in

282
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:16,280
opposition to a well-organized highly financed and politically militant group of homosexual

283
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:22,360
activists we were cast as bigots haters discriminators and deniers of basic

284
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:27,480
human rights and all of this happened because we were sincerely concerned for our children and our

285
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,720
community so anita's version of the story is that she and a handful of well-intentioned christian

286
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:40,760
mothers were cast as bigots by a highly funded mafia of gay extremists all because they had a

287
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:47,240
few teensy tiny concerns about the militant homosexual cavorting with little boys cavorting

288
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,720
with little boys is it really fair to call this woman a bigot until the dade county or

289
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:57,080
the county ordinance anita was a registered democrat and considered herself a liberal

290
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:02,840
and she never said that she hated gay people or wanted them dead in fact she even said that she

291
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,160
loves homosexuals i love homosexuals if you can believe that i love them enough to tell them the

292
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,720
truth because i know that there is hope for the homosexuals that if they're willing to

293
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,240
turn from sin the same as any individual that that they can be ex-homosexuals the same as there can

294
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,640
be an extra homosexual question is she a bigot no she's not a bigot she's not a homosexual performally

295
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,900
an ex-murderer, an ex-thief, or ex-anybody.

296
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,340
She loves homosexuals because they can change,

297
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,160
just like murderers.

298
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,320
Would a bigot have said that?

299
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,900
Just about McFuckin' had it.

300
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,740
Anita was so kind-hearted,

301
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,240
she even said that she related to the homosexual.

302
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,040
I can relate to the homosexual

303
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,940
because I've had emotional scars in my own life.

304
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,920
I really felt the rejection of my father,

305
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,100
and that is one of the things

306
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:51,140
that maybe leads someone going into homosexuality.

307
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,220
Look, I don't hate homosexuals, that's the truth,

308
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,140
no matter what they think of my motives.

309
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,660
I've always said I love the sinner, but I hate the sin.

310
00:18:58,660 --> 00:19:01,300
Wow, what an empath.

311
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,180
You know, I actually think it's really noble

312
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:06,380
how she's able to project all of her own emotional baggage

313
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,800
onto the marginalized group

314
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,540
whose rights she's trying to take away.

315
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:13,700
Okay, so we've given a fair hearing to both sides,

316
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,940
to many sides, we've considered all the evidence.

317
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:20,200
Now, let's suppose there's no longer a gun to my head

318
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,040
and ask,

319
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:25,320
did Anita Bryant really deserve that pie to the face?

320
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,160
Well, yes, obviously.

321
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,740
Look, the point I'm trying to make here

322
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:32,620
is that it's possible to take genuine virtues

323
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,660
like nuance, empathy, and impartiality,

324
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:38,800
and to twist them into fucked-up apologia

325
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,940
for horrible, oppressive behavior.

326
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,640
If you play this game long enough,

327
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,380
you can essentially explain away

328
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
the entire concept of bigotry

329
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,760
and conclude that, in reality, there are no bigots.

330
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:53,320
This is the true nature of all of us,

331
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,360
all of us who are human beings.

332
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,840
We're all human beings who have been

333
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,480
understood as people with difficult childhoods

334
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,940
and valid concerns cruelly demonized

335
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:07,500
by militant activists defaming and silencing them

336
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,720
with such reputation-ruining slurs as homophobe.

337
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,080
Now, because you viewers are smart, media-literate people,

338
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,040
you understand framing, so you already know

339
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,980
that I'm about to compare Anita Bryant

340
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:27,480
J.K. Rowling is a popular author who used to write whimsical stories about wizard school,

341
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,640
but who now writes books about transvestite serial killers masturbating into stolen panties

342
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,140
because she's lost her goddamn mind.

343
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,340
Lo ho ho, dear readers.

344
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,140
Christ, what a nightmare.

345
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,860
Chapter 3.

346
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,460
The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

347
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,880
Alright kids, it's trans in time.

348
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,440
Last year, I agreed to be a guest on a podcast about J.K. Rowling, hosted by Megan Phelps

349
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,720
Roper, an escapee from the Westboro Baptist Church, the notorious hate group from Topeka,

350
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:05,840
Kansas most known for protesting the funerals of soldiers with signs that say God hates

351
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,200
f**ks.

352
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,960
God and me both, I'm tired of you people.

353
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
J.K.

354
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
Illy!

355
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,440
The Westboro Baptist Church is one of the most famous homophobic hate groups in the

356
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
world.

357
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,980
I'm like a lifelong fan of these people.

358
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:26,800
I've watched all the Louis Theroux documentaries, I went to a counter-protest in 2010, I remember

359
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:31,340
how when I was in high school, the Westboro Baptist Church was like the one thing that

360
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:37,680
conservatives and liberals could agree on because they hated the troops and the gays.

361
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,680
Essentially the two genders of 2006.

362
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,840
But let's not pretend that the Westboro Baptist Church is all bad.

363
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:47,000
Okay, when Megan was at Westboro, she used to do these amazing ladies.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,160
She used to do these amazing Lady Gaga parodies about how the gays are going to hell, which

365
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:54,400
to this day I am a big fan of.

366
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,120
But what did you say you think God loves your brain?

367
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:01,400
He hates all you do cause you love fornicating.

368
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Fornicating.

369
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Fornicating.

370
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
It's perfect.

371
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I love it.

372
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Play it at my funeral.

373
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Stop praying, stop praying.

374
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,400
God will not hear you anymore.

375
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
You taught the boys and the girls to be proud.

376
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,400
For, for, forever burn.

377
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,400
Go devil's finder.

378
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,400
God will not hear you anymore.

379
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
You taught the boys and the girls to be proud.

380
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
For, for, forever burn.

381
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,400
Go devil's finder.

382
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,360
For, for, forever burn.

383
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Go devil's finder.

384
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,260
You just keep pushing on to the hell where you will forever burn.

385
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:26,420
Megan left the Westboro Baptist Church in 2012 after a crisis of faith precipitated

386
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,200
by a power struggle within the church.

387
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,400
She wrote about all this in her book Unfollow, which is honestly a pretty interesting account

388
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,740
of deconversion and the circumstances that lead someone to leaving a hate group.

389
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:45,220
Megan contacted me for her podcast because I had criticized TjK Rowling in a video a

390
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,220
couple years ago.

391
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:50,500
Now, you might be wondering, why would I think that a person who's been carrying a

392
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:55,580
God Hates F**ks sign most of her life would be the correct person to lead an international

393
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:59,220
conversation about the intricacies of LGBT issues?

394
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,120
Because I'm an idiot.

395
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
Happy?

396
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:06,860
Basically, I agreed to the podcast because it's a pretty irresistible pitch.

397
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:13,220
A former member of the Westboro Baptist Church wants to mediate a conversation between me

398
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,220
and the author of Harry Potter.

399
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
Would you say no to that?

400
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,220
Maybe.

401
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,620
If you're smart.

402
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:26,240
Last month, the podcast was announced in an essay by Megan titled The Witch Trials of

403
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,240
J.K.

404
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,240
Rowling.

405
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,460
Obviously a tendentious framing that posits Joro as the target of an irrational trans

406
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
witch hunt.

407
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:41,100
The essay included a teaser quote from Rowling complaining that she's been profoundly misunderstood,

408
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,540
as well as a photo of an angry trans mob holding a rotten hell roll.

409
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
I'm not sure if that's true.

410
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:49,080
The quote was a rotten hell Rowling sign, juxtaposed with an image of conservative Christians

411
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,740
burning Harry Potter books in the early 2000s.

412
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,980
This did not bode well.

413
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,340
So I disavowed the podcast on Twitter because I didn't want my name lending legitimacy to

414
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:02,560
some kind of unearned J.K.

415
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,540
Rowling redemption tour.

416
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:10,560
This caused Megan's mom, Shirley, to quote tweet me, calling me a bigot against God.

417
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,560
I mean, God is one of the most vulnerable minorities.

418
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:18,180
There's only one of him, and he could really use your help, Shirley.

419
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:24,660
I said in these tweets that I felt used, which that is how I felt, but ultimately I need

420
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:28,020
to take full responsibility for my involvement in this.

421
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,700
The thing about being a guest on a documentary like this is you honestly have no idea what

422
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:37,960
the final product is going to be like, so the decision to participate is always a leap

423
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,960
of faith.

424
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,560
And I can't really say that Megan misled me.

425
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:42,560
There are red flags from the video.

426
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
I don't know.

427
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,160
They were there from the beginning, and I ignored them because I was projecting my

428
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,540
own hopes onto the situation.

429
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,760
You know, it's a compelling story.

430
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,460
I liked the idea that this famous former bigot could talk some sense into a famous current

431
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,460
bigot.

432
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:05,780
We all love a good redemption arc, and I started my career de-radicalizing the alt-right.

433
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,700
That's something I've moved away from, but there's still part of me that wants to see

434
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,180
the best in people.

435
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,140
And to believe that people can change.

436
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:19,040
If you just talk to them, and make a good enough argument.

437
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:25,880
Maybe my wishful thinking was that because Megan left Westboro, that must mean that she

438
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:31,960
must understand the intricacies of anti-LGBT bigotry, right?

439
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,680
And despite no evidence for this, my hope was that Megan would act as a trans ally,

440
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,040
and could be really effective at confronting Joe Roe about all the trans stuff.

441
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
I don't know.

442
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:57,500
I'm Megan Phelps-Roper, and these are the Witch Trials of JK Rowling.

443
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:03,640
The Witch Trials of JK Rowling is more than seven hours of apologetics for JKR.

444
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:10,920
The podcast presents Rowling as a complex, humane, heroic figure with an inspiring feminist

445
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,920
backstory.

446
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:16,540
Joe Rowling's rise to success is this sort of feminist Cinderella story.

447
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:27,540
Now cruelly besieged by a vicious mob of transgender activists, all because she, as a woman, had

448
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:32,980
a few tiny concerns about the transgender rapists.

449
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:40,040
I had been becoming increasingly concerned about the way in which women were being shut

450
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,040
down.

451
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,360
And I felt had some very valid concerns.

452
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:50,940
Megan uncritically accepts Rowling's framing of the conflict as feminists versus trans

453
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:58,540
rights activists, whom Rowling describes as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

454
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:05,640
For the first five hours of this podcast, Rowling's critics are presented as an irrational

455
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,040
mob of enraged, shrieking, sexually violent fanatics.

456
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

457
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

458
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

459
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

460
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

461
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

462
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
And I think that's what makes this podcast so interesting.

463
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
You are murdering trans children!

464
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,040
Trans get up all time!

465
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:20,120
A huge amount of I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

466
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,280
And you did it at my birthday dinner!

467
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:28,260
There's this one clip of some kind of antifa supersoldiers abrasive screaming that they

468
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,920
play like once per episode.

469
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,920
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit.

470
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,920
You look like you got your teeth knocked out of your fuckin' flashes.

471
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:35,480
Nobody knows who you are and nobody cares and you will die alive.

472
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,100
I want to fight together.

473
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
I support my family.

474
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,440
I want to be a battle partner.

475
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:39,560
I want to be a battle partner.

476
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,000
I want to be a battle partner.

477
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:46,780
And then it usually cuts to, like, somber monks chanting some kind of medieval lament.

478
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:49,740
You will die alone and you will burn in hell!

479
00:27:55,160 --> 00:28:00,200
Just in case you didn't get from the title that this is a witch hunt.

480
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,820
Do you guys get it?

481
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,120
Do you get it yet?

482
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,400
Yeah, your teeth knocked out, you fucking fascist!

483
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:14,160
Let's get up on time!

484
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:21,260
And then these mobs of irrational, misogynistic, trans rights fanatics are contrasted with

485
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:28,740
this poignant story of how J.K. Rowling escaped her abusive husband to publish our generation's

486
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,300
most beloved novels.

487
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,460
I was still very committed to those parts that I'd plotted in darkness, as it were,

488
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,480
because there was a truth to them and there was a power to them.

489
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:39,940
The

490
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:47,540
only voices of genuine trans dissent appear in episode six out of seven, more than five

491
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,540
hours in.

492
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,160
And there's only two of us.

493
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:57,780
One is me, shame, and the other is a teenager named Noah, who kind of just seems like he

494
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:04,620
wants to be liked and understood, and wishes that his favorite author would please stop

495
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,600
saying bigoted things about him.

496
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,560
I'm such a big Harry Potter fan where I was such a big Harry Potter fan.

497
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:13,600
especially because it was so hard to be in the real world.

498
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,380
I can't even state how important it was to me.

499
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,700
J.K. Rowling, I stole her biography from my third grade classroom

500
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:24,740
and I kept it for a long time because I just loved reading it

501
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,140
because I just admired her so much.

502
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:29,000
It's honestly pretty heartbreaking to listen to.

503
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,180
On my last day editing this video, I got in touch with Noah.

504
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,240
I asked him if he had any thoughts about the podcast he wanted me to pass along

505
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,620
and this is what he said.

506
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,860
I want to emphasize that the stakes of this issue are very different

507
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,380
from any sort of rhetorical debate.

508
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,080
Conversation, dialogue, and debate are important,

509
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,500
but for many of the most vulnerable people in society,

510
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:50,880
the outcome of this conversation dictates their health, well-being,

511
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,060
and ability to survive.

512
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,280
How we treat or talk to people like J.K. Rowling should come second

513
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,180
to fighting for maintained access to health care, support,

514
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:01,600
and general resources for children and adolescents seeking gender care.

515
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,720
I agree.

516
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,840
The most frustrating thing about this podcast

517
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,600
is that it refuses to be honest about what it is.

518
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:12,760
They spend seven hours implying that J.K. Rowling is the victim of a witch hunt

519
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,580
in the most heavy-handed way imaginable.

520
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,720
These are the witch trials of J.K. Rowling.

521
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,220
I mean, TERF is basically witch.

522
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,140
But if you point this out, they just deny it.

523
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,280
Show me the actual words, Jack.

524
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,280
Show me where I said I'm the victim of a witch hunt by trans people.

525
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:35,460
You're on a podcast called The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling.

526
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,580
Yes, a podcast on which,

527
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:41,600
I never once say I'm a victim of a witch hunt by trans people.

528
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:42,660
What are you talking about?

529
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,360
I'm not scamming the government, if that's what you're saying.

530
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,120
Your license plate says scamming.

531
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,400
Uh, no.

532
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:49,980
What do you mean, no?

533
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:51,560
Yes.

534
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:52,960
Joanne.

535
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,880
Show me where I ever said that I'm the target of a witch hunt, you liar.

536
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:00,460
Why would you even think that?

537
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,380
You're crazy.

538
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:07,380
By the way, come get your This Witch Doesn't Burn t-shirt for sale now.

539
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
At Wild Womine Workshop.

540
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
And Megan is not much better.

541
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:16,620
Like, there's this whole section in episode two where Megan interviews Christians who

542
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:22,620
burned Harry Potter books in the 1990s, and this is obviously meant to be foreshadowing.

543
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:28,120
So, looking back, would you say that the Christian parents were maybe part of a moral panic?

544
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
Yeah, absolutely.

545
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,120
It's a scary world out there.

546
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:36,260
Megan doesn't explicitly say she thinks trans protests against Joe Rowe are equivalent to

547
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,900
the Christian ones in the 90s.

548
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,900
But she does heavily imply it.

549
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:46,540
There was an explosive reaction to Rowling's tweets, which led many, including lifelong

550
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:53,780
fans of her work, to condemn her and to call for her books to be banned, boycotted, and

551
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:56,360
in some cases, burned.

552
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,900
When confronted about the obvious implications of the podcast's title, Megan said,

553
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:02,900
The title is ambiguous.

554
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:04,900
Toward the end of our conversations, I spent a long time talking with Megan.

555
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,900
She said,

556
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,300
I spent a long time talking with J.K. Rowling about discernment, about how a person can

557
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:14,900
ever know if they're standing up for what's right, or joining a moral panic.

558
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:18,900
I think you'll be surprised by the thoughts she shares.

559
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,900
Megan, I was not surprised.

560
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,900
I know I won't ever regret having stood up on this issue.

561
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,900
Ever.

562
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,100
The podcast released new episodes weekly, and whenever Megan was challenged about the

563
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,900
blatant one-sidedness, Megan would respond,

564
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:33,900
Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?

565
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,900
Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?

566
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,660
Oh, you just think that because you haven't listened to the podcast?

567
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,660
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

568
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:39,820
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

569
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,820
Maybe you should preserve judgment.

570
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,820
Much more of Other Perspectives is coming, make sure to tune in next week.

571
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,820
Much more of Other Perspectives is coming, make sure to tune in next week.

572
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,820
Make sure to tune in next week.

573
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,820
More bombshell revelations to come.

574
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,820
Make sure to tune in next week.

575
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,820
More bombshell revelations to come.

576
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,820
More bombshell revelations to come.

577
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:48,820
More bombshell revelations to come.

578
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,820
Make sure to tune in next week.

579
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,820
Well, I've listened to the whole podcast now, and I truly do not think that anyone with

580
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:51,820
Google thôi basis media comprehension skills could come away from this thinking that the

581
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,820
main intent was anything other than to portray J.K. Rowling as him.

582
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:58,240
And I truly do not think that anyone with basic media comprehension skills

583
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:02,780
could come away from this thinking that the main intent was anything other

584
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:11,020
than to portray J.K. Rowling as the martyr of an unjust, uh, what's the word?

585
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,840
Witch hunt?

586
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:18,360
This is the obvious implication of the podcast from the first words to the very last.

587
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:22,080
And of course, Rowling does literally get the last word.

588
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,960
The final episode concludes with this.

589
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,220
There are more important things in this world than being popular.

590
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,820
And that doesn't mean it's more important to me to be right.

591
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,500
It means it's more important to me to do the right thing.

592
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,820
Why would you end on that note?

593
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:41,840
Why would anything about this podcast be the way it is

594
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:47,040
if Megan didn't fundamentally believe that J.K. Rowling isn't the right?

595
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,540
I don't regret it because I did the right thing.

596
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,000
Like there really is no other reasonable way

597
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
to interpret this.

598
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,720
So I wish that she would just be honest.

599
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:00,560
If you believe that J.K. Rowling is the misunderstood victim of a witch hunt,

600
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,520
then just say that.

601
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,020
Make the argument you want to make.

602
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,640
Don't crouch and hide behind this disavowal,

603
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,620
this obfuscating veil of just asking questions.

604
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,520
Don't rely on innuendo and framing and

605
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,220
lachrymose Gregorian chanting to make your point.

606
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,700
Well,

607
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,880
don't go around coyly denying you have any kind of agenda beyond.

608
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,940
I just believe in conversation.

609
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,720
I don't know.

610
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,540
I just find this a slippery and dishonest way to argue.

611
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:38,680
But if you happen to be a fan of slippery and dishonest arguments,

612
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:43,880
you're in luck because there is more where that came from.

613
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:48,260
This video is sponsored by Cannabox.

614
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,640
Cannabox offers fresh human meat

615
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,720
delivered directly to your doorstep.

616
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:57,300
As an alphabet mafiosa, sometimes I just can't fit the most dangerous game into my busy lifestyle

617
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,660
of destroying the family and recruiting children.

618
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:05,680
Whenever a new box arrives, I get out my copy of Bless This Food, the Anita Bryant family

619
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,300
cookbook.

620
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:10,600
The best thing about human meat delivered to your home by mail in the dead of night?

621
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:16,180
You don't know who you're eating, so it's totally guilt-free and ethically sourced.

622
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:16,940
Maybe.

623
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,720
There's no ethical consumption under capitalism.

624
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,080
Listen, that means you're not allowed to cancel me.

625
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,520
Chapter four, Joe Rowe's transphobia.

626
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,120
That's it.

627
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,500
I'm going full Slytherin.

628
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:37,120
In episode five of The Witch Trials of J.K. Rowling, Joe Rowe compares trans activists

629
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:40,900
to Death Eaters, the fictionalized fascists in Harry Potter.

630
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:48,620
My position is that this activist movement, in the form that it's currently taking, echoes

631
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:49,700
the very thing that I was doing.

632
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,200
I was warning against in Harry Potter.

633
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:56,340
The Death Eaters claimed we have been made to live in secret, and now is our time.

634
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:02,720
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious, misogynistic movement.

635
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,880
When an article then claimed she had equated trans people to Death Eaters, the podcast's

636
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,700
PR firm reached out, demanding a correction.

637
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:16,620
Because she only equated the movement to Death Eaters, not trans people in general.

638
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,760
Yeah, I don't hate marginalized people.

639
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,520
I just hate it.

640
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,420
I hate it when they advocate for themselves.

641
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,260
So I do have to be very careful with my wording here, lest a defamation letter arrive by owl.

642
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:30,980
J.K. Rowling's bigotry is exhausting to argue with, because she expresses it as an endless

643
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:34,760
series of what are called Mott and Bailey arguments.

644
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:39,760
A Mott and Bailey argument is named after a type of castle consisting of a Mott, that

645
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,880
is, a tower atop a mound or hill, easy to defend, and a Bailey, a fenced courtyard that's

646
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:49,160
much more vulnerable to attack, difficult to defend.

647
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:53,540
The Mott and Bailey argument is when someone makes a provocative claim that's difficult

648
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,840
to defend.

649
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,900
The Bailey.

650
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,020
And then, when confronted with counter-arguments, they walk it back to a much less controversial

651
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,700
and easy-to-defend version of the claim.

652
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,920
The Mott.

653
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:10,700
For example, Rowling will make an ambiguous claim like, sex is real.

654
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,360
What does she mean by that?

655
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,360
What are the implications?

656
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:19,360
Well, in the podcast, she explains that she thinks it's very sinister that in the Associated

657
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:25,500
Press style guide, it says that instead of referring to a trans woman as a man who identifies

658
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,680
as a woman, journalists should simply say a trans woman is a woman.

659
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:33,500
That, from the Associated Press, is hugely powerful.

660
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:38,960
They've edged from identifies as a woman, so a man identifies as a woman, which, and

661
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,280
I think we all understand what that means, into is a woman.

662
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,660
And that's precisely the creep that I'm talking about.

663
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,680
We are using language to...

664
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,540
To make accurate definition of sex difference unspeakable.

665
00:37:54,540 --> 00:38:00,480
Which is of course false, because the words trans and cis exist precisely to make it easy

666
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,500
to talk about sex difference.

667
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,500
Thanks a lot, Tumblr.

668
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:08,180
God, there's this whole section of the podcast that sort of implies that transgender people

669
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:13,580
were invented on Tumblr, which I'm not even gonna get into because we don't have time.

670
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:17,500
Rowling has also tweeted that she thinks that all people who menstruate must be referred

671
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,660
to as women.

672
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
Or was it wombin?

673
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,480
I'm pretty sure it was wompmud.

674
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:27,720
So trans men and transmasculine people, they're all women and must be referred to as women.

675
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,920
Because J.K. Rowling demands it.

676
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,960
This is controversial, right?

677
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,060
Calling trans women men who identify as women.

678
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,660
Calling trans men women.

679
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,920
This is the Bailey in her Mott and Bailey argument.

680
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,180
Trans women are men.

681
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,180
Trans men are women.

682
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:45,540
That's the controversial interpretation of sex is real.

683
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:48,540
Now, when accused of transphobia and facing backlash...

684
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,640
Rowling walks the argument back and says,

685
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,660
I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being

686
00:38:56,660 --> 00:38:59,220
female has shaped our lives.

687
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,640
Women should be allowed to discuss how being female has shaped our lives.

688
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:09,000
This is the obvious and utterly uncontroversial interpretation of sex is real.

689
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,000
The Mott.

690
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,980
And virtually every argument sophisticated transphobes make about trans people follows

691
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,980
this pattern.

692
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,680
J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstadter, said,

693
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being

694
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,680
female has shaped our lives.

695
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,680
I'm being persecuted just for saying that women should be allowed to discuss how being

696
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
female has shaped our lives.

697
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,680
J.K. Rowling's friend and ally, Maya Forstadter, will tweet inflammatory things like,

698
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Men cannot change into women.

699
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:27,680
But then when she's criticised, she'll say that she's being attacked for gender-critical

700
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,680
belief.

701
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:35,160
Gender-critical belief, which is absolutely ordinary belief about sex that your mother

702
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,080
and your grandmother are women.

703
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,080
That being female is a thing.

704
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:41,920
Your mother and grandmother are women.

705
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,580
Being female is a thing.

706
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,640
That's literally all I'm saying.

707
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,640
But if that's literally all she was saying...

708
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,860
then no one would be mad, would they?

709
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,600
Nine, gnar.

710
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,900
Men cannot change into women, is the Bailey.

711
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,540
Your mom is a woman, is the Mott.

712
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,800
Your mom's a woman.

713
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,900
This is why arguing with these people is infuriating.

714
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,780
They'll insinuate that trans women are dangerous rapists,

715
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,700
exhibitionists, and voyeurs.

716
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,580
Then when trans people understandably get mad,

717
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,780
they'll say, look, I'm being attacked

718
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:17,160
just for saying that being female is part of my experience.

719
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,180
It's dishonest.

720
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,260
They talk a bunch of trash about trans people,

721
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,300
and then when trans people talk trash back,

722
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,940
they pretend that they're being victimized

723
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:26,080
for making totally innocuous statements.

724
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,760
We could name this behavior the birthday boy argument.

725
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,680
I dated a 5'8 guy who'd taunt

726
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,840
every jacked 6'3 bro he met

727
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,420
until they'd pull their fist back to beat him up,

728
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,620
whereupon my ex would go, hey, hey, hey, come on.

729
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,740
I'm a little guy.

730
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,920
I'm just a little guy.

731
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,520
No, it's also my birthday.

732
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,360
I'm a little birthday boy.

733
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,120
And somehow, it always happens.

734
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,960
It always worked.

735
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,500
So a birthday boy argument

736
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:52,440
is when you make aggressive, inflammatory assertions,

737
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:56,220
followed by, teacher, teacher, look what he's doing to me,

738
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,220
when the target reacts

739
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,460
with anything less than extreme politeness.

740
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:00,900
Another common tactic you'll see

741
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,440
any time Rowling's transphobia is discussed

742
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,260
is you'll see someone jump in to say,

743
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:08,520
show me one thing she's said that's transphobic.

744
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,660
For example, here's someone on Twitter

745
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,960
called Large Gamete Producer.

746
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,020
It's funny, isn't it, how these people will insist

747
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,940
that awkward, inclusive language like people who menstruate

748
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:22,140
is horribly oppressive and degrading,

749
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:24,020
but then they'll just straight up call themselves

750
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,620
Large Gamete Producer,

751
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,540
which, by the way, is Rowling's definition of a woman.

752
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,540
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

753
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,380
Oh, I like it.

754
00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:35,720
It's very broodmother.

755
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,580
That Rowling's words regularly appear

756
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:40,660
in gender-critical arguments shows the massive influence

757
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,900
that she has in the anti-trans movement.

758
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,860
She's like their queen, their leader, their headmistress.

759
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:48,100
She's the best thing that ever happened to them.

760
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,340
Because Sheila Jeffries certainly wasn't persuading

761
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,180
a lot of people.

762
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,240
If you know, you know.

763
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,400
Large Gamete Producer says,

764
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,460
GK isn't anti-trans.

765
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:00,020
Give me just one direct quote that she has said

766
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,440
which is anti-trans.

767
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,740
Oh, what's that?

768
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,280
You can't find one?

769
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,500
Well, color me shocked.

770
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,340
Imagine.

771
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:09,680
Before we waste our time trying to provide examples,

772
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:13,200
let's take a look at Large Gamete Producer's profile.

773
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,740
Trans women are not women, they are men.

774
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:18,520
Trans men are not men, they are women.

775
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,900
Nothing can change that.

776
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,300
Sex is binary.

777
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:25,420
Like if this person doesn't think that trans women are men,

778
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:28,780
trans men are women is a transphobic statement,

779
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:31,440
then what would they consider a transphobic statement?

780
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,660
This is why the first question you should always ask

781
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:36,780
such people is, do you believe that transphobia

782
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,500
is a legitimate concept?

783
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,180
What are some examples of statements

784
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:42,240
that you would consider transphobic?

785
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,740
Because many of them don't believe that transphobia

786
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,700
is a valid concept.

787
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,760
Because they don't think that trans people

788
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,380
are a legitimate minority.

789
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,880
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

790
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,040
There's no such thing as a trans person.

791
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,000
There is no such thing.

792
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,900
There are people that call themselves these things

793
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:00,180
that may have other issues manifesting

794
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,260
that then make them think they're this, but no.

795
00:43:02,260 --> 00:43:04,940
We have to stop using any words like transgender.

796
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,700
There may be more words that we have to say

797
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,640
in order to say that.

798
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,960
We may call it transgender ideology,

799
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,500
but when it comes to a person,

800
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,980
they may be following transgender ideology,

801
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:15,500
but they are not transgender.

802
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:18,100
There is no such thing as a man or a woman

803
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,300
being anything other than a man or a woman.

804
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,640
So when they say, show me an example

805
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,340
of something transphobic JK Rowling has said,

806
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:26,600
this is a trap.

807
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,820
They're just messing with you.

808
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:29,880
There's nothing that she could have said

809
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:31,940
that they would acknowledge as transphobic.

810
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:34,020
Now, if you're someone who believes that transphobia

811
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:35,260
is a valid concept,

812
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,300
and you believe that trans people are a legitimate minority,

813
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,260
but you just genuinely are unaware

814
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,580
of what JK Rowling has said on the topic,

815
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,360
then I will refer you to my past video on JK Rowling,

816
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:48,580
rather than recapping it all here.

817
00:43:48,580 --> 00:43:51,240
Just keep in mind that she's gotten significantly worse

818
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,580
since I made that video.

819
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:54,400
I mean, just look at her Twitter feed.

820
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,520
True, she never says the phrase, I hate trans people,

821
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,340
because she's not a complete idiot,

822
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:02,140
but Anita Bryant never said, I hate gay people.

823
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,380
She said, save our children.

824
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,840
I love homosexuals.

825
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:07,780
For that matter, I'm pretty sure David Duke

826
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,020
doesn't say, I hate black people,

827
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:12,260
but he will share a lot of statistics

828
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,140
about anti-white crime.

829
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:15,000
So this is not really,

830
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,600
a very good criterion for deciding who's a bigot, is it?

831
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,480
What JK Rowling does do is tweet again and again

832
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,320
about transgender rapists,

833
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:27,180
about the danger trans women pose to cis women.

834
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,340
She implies that trans-inclusive language

835
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:32,640
is equivalent to the dystopia of Orwell's 1984.

836
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,940
She writes at length about the vague nefarious cabal

837
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:38,100
of endocrinologists and ideologue

838
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:40,520
that is supposedly persuading

839
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:43,480
confused vulnerable girls to transition.

840
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,220
To quote Washington Post opinion,

841
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:46,580
writer Monica Hess,

842
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,820
I do not know what is in Rowling's heart,

843
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,480
but reading her Twitter feed,

844
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,200
this is the overall effect.

845
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,160
Her Twitter feed does not ask its readers to think.

846
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:57,020
It asks them to fear.

847
00:44:57,020 --> 00:45:01,300
It creates phobias of trans people.

848
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:06,300
It creates trans-phobias, if you will.

849
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,700
Rowling has also attacked pro-trans politician,

850
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:12,920
Nicola Sturgeon, calling her a destroyer of women's rights

851
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,060
via a t-shirt.

852
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,100
This is what she got from anti-trans hate-monger Posey Parker.

853
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:18,600
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

854
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,760
There's no such thing as a trans person.

855
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:21,720
There is no such thing.

856
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:24,380
If there's one thing that I want people to understand

857
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:26,080
about Rowling's transphobia,

858
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:29,140
it's that this is not a case of someone posting

859
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,720
a couple insensitive tweets

860
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,380
that got blown out of proportion.

861
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,320
Rowling is an extremely outspoken opponent of trans rights.

862
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:39,320
This has been her main issue for several years now.

863
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,580
And because she's so famous,

864
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,460
she's become the de facto global champion,

865
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:44,020
of trans women.

866
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:46,580
A champion of backlash to trans rights.

867
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:49,180
Truly, the Anita Bryant of transphobia.

868
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:52,060
Except worse, because she's way more famous

869
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,180
and way more liked than Anita Bryant ever was.

870
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:58,520
Rowling has also praised self-described theocratic fascist,

871
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:01,400
Matt Walsh, for his transphobic propaganda film.

872
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,340
She refers to trans women as trans-identified males,

873
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,080
known as Tims, among people for whom this has become

874
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,240
an unhealthy obsession.

875
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:11,420
She retweets images of the trans colors

876
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,420
being erased from the progress flag.

877
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,720
Also, the colors representing queer people of color.

878
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:17,080
So, you know, great.

879
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,860
Love that.

880
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:20,580
Often, Rowling pretends that she's being transphobic

881
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,100
for the principled and valiant purpose of defending lesbians.

882
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,360
It's something of a fixation for her.

883
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,460
I find this particularly gross,

884
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,960
because it plays into the lesbophobic trope

885
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,620
that gay women are especially anti-trans,

886
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:36,720
when in fact, they're the least transphobic demographic

887
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:37,720
of cis people.

888
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,400
According to a survey of young adults in the UK,

889
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:43,220
lesbians were most likely to know a trans person,

890
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:46,680
and also most likely, at 96%,

891
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,060
to say that they're supportive,

892
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,260
or very supportive of trans people.

893
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,680
So I think it's fair to say that most gay women

894
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,960
are probably not super thrilled

895
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,660
whenever Joe Rowe, the lesbian defender, logs on.

896
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,720
My own partner is a cis lesbian,

897
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,180
and I asked her if she enjoys JK Rowling

898
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,520
defending her from the transsexuals, and she said,

899
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:10,340
It makes me want to gouge out my eyes like Oedipus.

900
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:13,220
By the way, here is JK Rowling enjoying a bit

901
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:16,780
of banter with her friend Baroness Emma Nicholson,

902
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,400
the co-founder of Rowling's charity, Lumos.

903
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,320
Baroness Nicholson is a conservative member

904
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,640
of the House of Lords who voted against

905
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,060
same-sex marriage in 2013.

906
00:47:26,060 --> 00:47:29,120
In 2020, she tweeted in defense of her vote,

907
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,240
claiming that gay marriage would lead to

908
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,300
degrading the status of women and girls.

909
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:37,320
Truly one of the great lesbian allies.

910
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,900
And in 2022, here is JK Rowling

911
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,340
joking around with Lady Nicholson.

912
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:43,060
Excellent question.

913
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:43,900
Emma.

914
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:47,280
Defining lesbians as same-sex attracted women

915
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,120
excludes and depresses the most marginalized of all groups,

916
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:55,520
i.e. people with penises and beards who want to shag women.

917
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,780
And before you say, but aren't they straight men?

918
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:01,840
They're wearing eyeliner, bigot.

919
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:05,320
Try for a moment to put aside any nostalgia you may have

920
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,120
for the Gryffindor common room,

921
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:09,760
and just look at this interaction for what it is.

922
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,040
Two straight women, one of whom is a homophobic peer

923
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:16,140
of the realm, having a nice little chuckle together

924
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:19,220
about how trans women are men wearing eyeliner.

925
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,800
So that's it, right?

926
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:21,700
It's over.

927
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:24,920
Case closed.

928
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:28,920
I still like hammering things.

929
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:33,220
I'm not gonna argue anymore about whether JK Rowling

930
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:36,940
is transphobic, because anyone who believes in transphobia

931
00:48:36,940 --> 00:48:39,660
can see that obviously she is.

932
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:42,880
The question now is whether transphobia is the sort of

933
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,380
thing that progressives can denounce,

934
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,400
the way we at least aspire to denounce racism,

935
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,360
misogyny, and homophobia.

936
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,940
That's usually what we're talking about

937
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:54,140
when we talk about JK Rowling, right?

938
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:56,980
Whether it's fair to cancel her.

939
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:00,480
That's what the witch trials of JK Rowling is about.

940
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,920
The Rowling debate is a proxy for a larger question.

941
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,700
Is transphobia a legitimate viewpoint

942
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:09,620
worthy of polite consideration and respect

943
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,760
in liberal, humane society?

944
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:12,660
Or, is it just an option?

945
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:13,960
Or is it just an ugly prejudice

946
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,060
that we can justifiably react to

947
00:49:16,060 --> 00:49:18,040
with scorn and condemnation?

948
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:20,120
And there's an even broader question here

949
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,660
about whether we can justifiably react to anything

950
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,520
with scorn and condemnation.

951
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,920
Is canceling ever warranted?

952
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,260
Is it right to condemn racism, homophobia, and misogyny?

953
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,840
Or should we allow spokespeople for these prejudices

954
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,320
a respected position in the free marketplace of ideas

955
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,200
where we can all sit around debating the legitimacy

956
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:46,220
of gay marriage or the possible merits of a white ethnostate?

957
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,960
Is the final solution a myth promulgated

958
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:50,840
by the international Jew?

959
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:54,380
Are yoga pants to blame for sexual violence?

960
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,240
Wouldn't the taxpayers save a lot of money

961
00:49:57,240 --> 00:49:59,720
if there weren't so many disabled people?

962
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:00,760
Who knows?

963
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,340
These are open questions.

964
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:06,300
Let's sit down with people on both sides, on many sides,

965
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:09,160
and have calm, civil conversations about it

966
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,600
for the rest of our goddamn lives.

967
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,280
Five, debate.

968
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:18,200
Sar, I know I did this look before

969
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:21,480
and it's like not related to the video topic at all,

970
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,320
but it just makes me feel slithing.

971
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,620
The boy who slithed.

972
00:50:25,620 --> 00:50:27,860
So Megan Phelps-Roberts' viewpoint seems to be

973
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:31,140
that scorn and condemnation are never appropriate,

974
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,040
that we should approach every conflict

975
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:34,640
with empathy and compassion,

976
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,540
even when dealing with the worst,

977
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:39,540
most destructive people in the world.

978
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,980
Hi, my name is Megan,

979
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,980
and my heretical friend, Megan Phelps, is a gay man.

980
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,960
My heretical belief is that even the people

981
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:46,040
who seem to be the worst,

982
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:48,100
most destructive people in the world

983
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:51,660
are human beings who deserve compassion and empathy

984
00:50:51,660 --> 00:50:53,600
if we want to find a way to change their minds.

985
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,800
In her book, in her TED Talk,

986
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,660
in her public appearances,

987
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,640
Megan expresses the idea

988
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,640
that society has recently become polarized

989
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,000
in some unprecedented way,

990
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,540
that we've all become extremists,

991
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:10,380
that in some sense, we've all become

992
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:11,760
the Westboro Baptist Church.

993
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:14,660
I can't help but see in our public discourse

994
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,200
so many of the same destructive impulses

995
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:19,000
that ruled my former church.

996
00:51:19,000 --> 00:51:21,260
She identifies things like certainty,

997
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:23,300
vilification of compromise,

998
00:51:23,300 --> 00:51:25,160
us versus them thinking,

999
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,880
suppression of empathy,

1000
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,440
and celebration of death and misfortune

1001
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,020
as Westboro-like elements in public discourse.

1002
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,840
And this really bothers Megan,

1003
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:37,620
because she claims that a decade ago,

1004
00:51:37,620 --> 00:51:39,180
when she went on Twitter to tweet about

1005
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,860
how marriage is abominable to God,

1006
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:44,580
it was people who engaged her in a civil,

1007
00:51:44,580 --> 00:51:47,660
rational way that eventually led her

1008
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:50,220
to renouncing Westboro's ideology.

1009
00:51:50,220 --> 00:51:54,160
And like, I don't entirely disagree with Megan about this.

1010
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,920
She's totally right that if you want

1011
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,500
to change people's minds,

1012
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:00,300
then approaching them with compassion and empathy

1013
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,920
is usually the best way to do that.

1014
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:04,860
But Megan reaches another conclusion

1015
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,300
that I don't agree with,

1016
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:09,700
which is that because compassion and civil conversation

1017
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:11,700
are most likely to persuade people,

1018
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:14,400
we should never cancel anyone,

1019
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,760
even the most horrible bigots.

1020
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,420
And canceling is a pretty meaningless term at this point.

1021
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:23,140
But what Megan means is we shouldn't say mean things

1022
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:23,980
to bigots.

1023
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:26,540
We shouldn't boycott or counter-protest

1024
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,180
or raise our voices.

1025
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:31,000
We shouldn't shun or exclude anyone,

1026
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:34,140
because that's just not how you change minds.

1027
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,080
And I get why Megan thinks this, right?

1028
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:38,940
De-radicalization was a really important part

1029
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:40,560
of her life experience.

1030
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,340
She's also clearly holding out

1031
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,520
hope that other members of her family

1032
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,260
will leave Westboro and have a life on the outside.

1033
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,560
She has a quote from her mom in her Twitter bio.

1034
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:50,820
The last lines of her book address her family.

1035
00:52:50,820 --> 00:52:52,760
"'I want to tell them that I love them.

1036
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,760
I'll just have to find another way.'"

1037
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,680
This is touching and human

1038
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:59,740
and also kind of a conflict of interest.

1039
00:52:59,740 --> 00:53:03,500
The problem is Megan's views about this only makes sense

1040
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:07,340
if you assume that Megan is the main character of reality.

1041
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:10,580
If you assume that the moral improvement of bigots

1042
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:13,860
is more important than protecting the people they target.

1043
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:16,420
Or if you assume that changing bigots' minds

1044
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:19,920
is the only way to make social progress, which it isn't.

1045
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,320
As far as I know, Anita Bryant is 83 years old

1046
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:25,620
and she's still homophobic.

1047
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:27,740
But even without Anita's blessing,

1048
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:31,120
gay rights have still somehow managed to progress

1049
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:32,760
since the 1970s.

1050
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:36,720
Because gay activists didn't need to persuade Anita Bryant.

1051
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,960
They needed to defeat her.

1052
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,340
And that's what they did.

1053
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:42,820
We have to accept that realistically,

1054
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:46,340
persuading all the bigots is just not an option.

1055
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,700
Yes, we should convince as many people as possible,

1056
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,820
but there will always be bigots.

1057
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:55,300
And mocking them, shaming them, or boycotting them

1058
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:58,100
is, I think, a perfectly valid strategy.

1059
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:00,940
Does that mean that when we cancel bigots,

1060
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:05,180
we're acting kind of like the Westboro Baptist Church?

1061
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,020
Gnar.

1062
00:54:06,020 --> 00:54:09,300
You would only think that if you're a total moral relativist.

1063
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:09,860
I guess controversial opinions are the only way to do that.

1064
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,360
It's not a controversial opinion, but bigotry is shameful.

1065
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:14,820
And it should be shamed.

1066
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:15,820
I'll say it.

1067
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,300
You know, if you're testing out some racist ideas in your head,

1068
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:22,220
you might feel afraid to express them publicly

1069
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:25,240
for fear of being shamed or judged.

1070
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,260
Is that because we live in an Orwellian dystopia

1071
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:30,740
that punishes people for wrong-think?

1072
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:34,460
No, it's because racism is dangerous and shameful

1073
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:36,100
and you should be ashamed of it

1074
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:38,700
and the people judging you are right to do so.

1075
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,700
And sure, there are some very, very, very, very,

1076
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:42,620
very patient people who devote their lives

1077
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:44,380
to de-radicalizing bigots,

1078
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:47,680
which I think is a perfectly noble thing to do.

1079
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,380
There's a guy named Daryl Davis

1080
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:51,840
who's befriended members of the Ku Klux Klan

1081
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,300
for over 30 years,

1082
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,200
and he claims he's convinced more than 200 of them to leave.

1083
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,540
And good for him.

1084
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:01,320
De-radicalization is a valid strategy,

1085
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:03,760
but it cannot be the only strategy

1086
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:06,960
and it must not be the primary strategy.

1087
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,140
Because we're not going to defeat racism

1088
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:12,840
by telling black people to be a little nicer to racists.

1089
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,100
Feminists would be wasting their time

1090
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:18,160
trying to convince Andrew Tate to respect women.

1091
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,580
In general, I think that the massive effort

1092
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:23,340
that it takes to maybe persuade bigots

1093
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:26,100
is better spent persuading other people

1094
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,540
not to listen to them.

1095
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,520
And it's also worth cautioning that de-radicalization

1096
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,760
is often a messy and incomplete process.

1097
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,860
20-year-old white nationalist Peter Sejtanovic

1098
00:55:36,860 --> 00:55:39,020
became the face of the fascist Unite the Right,

1099
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,460
the right rally in 2017

1100
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:45,920
when a photo of him mid-scream, tiki torch in hand,

1101
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,980
was published in news outlets all over the country.

1102
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:51,280
Peter was unrepentant in interviews

1103
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,600
he gave immediately after the rally,

1104
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,960
but he began to question his beliefs

1105
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,620
after befriending a Muslim woman who,

1106
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:00,960
according to Charlotte MacDonald Gibson,

1107
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:03,720
challenged his views without insulting him,

1108
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,100
allowing him to understand the hurt he had caused.

1109
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,780
Peter is no longer a white nationalist,

1110
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,400
but that doesn't mean he's fleshed out

1111
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,100
every trace of bigotry.

1112
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,160
In a 2019 interview with the London School of Economics

1113
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,220
student paper, Peter said,

1114
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:20,340
I don't like the whole transgender thing.

1115
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:22,540
You're born either a man or a woman.

1116
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:26,420
So he maybe still has a little bit of work to do.

1117
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:29,220
When I did de-radicalization work on YouTube,

1118
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,120
I used to get some criticism from people of color

1119
00:56:32,120 --> 00:56:34,300
who were not thrilled that I was bringing

1120
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,800
a bunch of semi-reformed racists over to the left,

1121
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:38,260
a frustration that I don't like, but I do like.

1122
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:38,760
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.

1123
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:39,280
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.

1124
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:39,780
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.

1125
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,280
I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that. I don't like that.

1126
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:43,120
To paraphrase YouTuber Ian Danskin,

1127
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:47,400
diverse leftist communities are maybe not the best holding space

1128
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:48,400
for someone who's

1129
00:56:48,400 --> 00:56:50,560
a bit of a Nazi but working on it.

1130
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,740
In the case of Megan Phelps Roper,

1131
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:55,820
I don't know if she has lingering bigoted sentiments,

1132
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:59,720
but what she does have is a kind of hypervigilant skepticism

1133
00:56:59,720 --> 00:57:03,180
about anything she perceives as ideology.

1134
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:04,720
This is pretty common with people

1135
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:07,160
who used to be religious fundamentalists.

1136
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:08,260
They were so certain they were right,

1137
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:11,760
only to realize that everything they believed

1138
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:13,420
about the world is wrong.

1139
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:17,420
So they become distrustful of any strong moral convictions

1140
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:20,500
because it reminds them of their former fanaticism.

1141
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:21,940
Coming from Westboro,

1142
00:57:21,940 --> 00:57:25,660
where I believed so strongly that I was doing the right thing

1143
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:27,420
and then to leave and come to believe

1144
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,620
that it was so destructive and harmful,

1145
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,800
I had this moment in time and it lasted for many months

1146
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,380
where I was like,

1147
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,820
how can I ever trust my own mind again?

1148
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,240
This kind of skepticism is in some ways a good impulse,

1149
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:47,220
but valuing dispassionate intellectualism above all else

1150
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,760
can cause problems,

1151
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,440
especially where topics of social justice are concerned.

1152
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:55,560
Because it can lead you to this kind of toxic centrism

1153
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:56,560
that asks,

1154
00:57:56,560 --> 00:58:01,540
why are marginalized people so unwilling to have calm,

1155
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:04,760
philosophical debates about whether they should have rights?

1156
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:07,220
Are they afraid of dangerous ideas?

1157
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:10,140
Atheist philosopher Sam Harris,

1158
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,740
in his podcast about Megan's podcast,

1159
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,120
can we talk about how there are too many podcasts?

1160
00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:18,640
I'm calling for a complete and total shutdown of podcasts

1161
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,800
until we can figure out what's going on.

1162
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,460
Sam Harris, in his podcast about Megan's podcast,

1163
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,600
complained that trans activism and activism in general

1164
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,860
is plagued by mental illness and hysteria.

1165
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:35,860
I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.

1166
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:36,700
I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.

1167
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:37,200
I frankly think there's a fair degree of mental instability.

1168
00:58:37,220 --> 00:58:42,760
and even frank mental illness in the activist community.

1169
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:45,900
I mean, in really in all activist communities.

1170
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:51,100
The level of viciousness and hysteria is,

1171
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:53,300
you know, it's hard to know what to compare it to.

1172
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,160
Diversity when...

1173
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,180
Man accuses trans women of being hysterical.

1174
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:02,080
Is it really hysteria to react with strong emotions

1175
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:05,820
when your basic inclusion in society is up for debate?

1176
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:07,200
Aren't there certain situations

1177
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,380
where strong emotions are warranted?

1178
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:11,300
It reminds me of this awful episode

1179
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,620
of Joe Rogan feat Ben Shapiro,

1180
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,720
where little Benny argues that gay marriage is immoral

1181
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:19,040
with his usual whining sophistry.

1182
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:21,360
And Joe gently raises objections

1183
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,340
for Ben to talk circles around.

1184
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:27,060
The human sex drive was made to procreate

1185
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,420
within a stable relationship

1186
00:59:28,420 --> 00:59:30,360
in order to progenerate

1187
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,840
and have future generations of people.

1188
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:34,080
Misuse of that sex drive in any way,

1189
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:36,460
whether you're talking about from masturbation

1190
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,760
to homosexual activity,

1191
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,840
is therefore a diminishment of the use of that drive.

1192
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,940
That's the natural law case against homosexual activity.

1193
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:47,360
All of the top comments on this video are like this.

1194
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:49,160
Imagine talking about different beliefs

1195
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,060
while still having a productive conversation.

1196
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:53,320
Things progress when you don't demonize people.

1197
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,860
The discussion here was excellent.

1198
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,560
Two guys with opposing opinions,

1199
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,240
speaking calmly and intellectually without cursing,

1200
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,060
shouting and making disparaging comments about each other.

1201
01:00:02,620 --> 01:00:03,800
This is how it should be done.

1202
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,280
Kudos to both of them.

1203
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,440
Joe is a great interviewer.

1204
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:08,000
He can totally disagree with someone

1205
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,060
and still have a calm, collective conversation.

1206
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:11,440
This is how it should be.

1207
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:13,100
Just two people sharing ideas,

1208
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,860
learning different point of views from each other.

1209
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,000
This is why Joe is the number one podcast.

1210
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,320
Joe Rogan beautifully asked the tough questions.

1211
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,700
And Ben answers honestly.

1212
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:22,320
He is strong in his faith.

1213
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:25,340
I love this debate because it's two so contrasting views

1214
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,760
and they have a civil conversation.

1215
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:27,740
Great learning.

1216
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:30,680
And like, yeah, it's easy for two straight men

1217
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:33,880
to have a dispassionate theoretical conversation

1218
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,220
about the ethics of homosexuality.

1219
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:38,180
Because it's not their lives

1220
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:40,880
and their relationships that are up for debate.

1221
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,080
These people don't understand the emotional burden

1222
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,820
placed on marginalized people

1223
01:00:45,820 --> 01:00:48,280
who are asked to defend their rights.

1224
01:00:48,500 --> 01:00:49,420
Like, if you're straight,

1225
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,060
do you want to publicly debate

1226
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,920
whether your marriage is valid?

1227
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,980
Andrew Dworkin claimed that

1228
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:57,960
penetrative heterosexual intercourse

1229
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:00,180
is inherently an act of violence.

1230
01:01:00,420 --> 01:01:02,460
I've noticed that most straight men

1231
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:06,060
don't want to have a calm, civil conversation about that.

1232
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:06,440
So if you're straight,

1233
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:07,820
imagine how they'd react

1234
01:01:07,820 --> 01:01:10,160
if there was a powerful political movement

1235
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,060
to criminalize penetration

1236
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:14,060
or revoke their right to marry.

1237
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:16,320
Add in a lifetime of ostracism,

1238
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:17,500
family rejection,

1239
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,400
bullying, and discrimination,

1240
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,660
and maybe then you'll begin to understand

1241
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:25,500
the hysteria of a lot of queer people.

1242
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:27,560
It is my right to raise my child

1243
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:28,760
with the moral precept

1244
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:31,060
that I find to be beneficial for my child.

1245
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,300
Beto O'Rourke does not get to raise my child.

1246
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:34,500
And if he tries,

1247
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:35,740
I will meet him at the door with a gun.

1248
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,380
That is insane.

1249
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,720
Wow, Ben Shapiro threatening violence

1250
01:01:39,720 --> 01:01:42,040
because he can't handle the debate.

1251
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:45,100
Sounds like a classic case of hysteria to me.

1252
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:48,300
Why can't Ben Shapiro just have a polite conversation

1253
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,960
about Beto O'Rourke transing his children?

1254
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,020
I now have two choices.

1255
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:53,860
One is to leave the country utterly.

1256
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,080
Two is to pick up a gun.

1257
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:56,760
Those are the only choices that you have left me.

1258
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,500
Dave Rubin is a gay conservative

1259
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:02,060
whose career requires that he convince

1260
01:02:02,060 --> 01:02:05,640
his right-wing audience that he's one of the good ones.

1261
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:06,260
This means that he's not the only one

1262
01:02:06,260 --> 01:02:07,980
who's willing to sit across

1263
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:09,520
from his so-called friend,

1264
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,540
homophobe Ben Shapiro,

1265
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:13,280
and listen to Ben say

1266
01:02:13,280 --> 01:02:15,900
he would never attend his anniversary party

1267
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:19,040
because it would be tantamount to endorsing sin.

1268
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:20,920
There's a difference between me

1269
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,380
just being friends with Dave

1270
01:02:22,380 --> 01:02:25,940
and me actively participating in an event

1271
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:27,920
that I feel is religiously sinful.

1272
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,420
The two of them then congratulate themselves

1273
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:33,160
about how they can still be great friends.

1274
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,840
Why is it that we're able to do this?

1275
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:35,880
Why is it that we're able to do this?

1276
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:37,500
And most people can't do this.

1277
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:38,700
That's what I'm curious about.

1278
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,620
We go home at night and we can have our own lives.

1279
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:43,060
And here's Dave having a civil conversation

1280
01:02:43,060 --> 01:02:44,880
with conservative Glenn Beck,

1281
01:02:44,980 --> 01:02:47,720
who compares homosexuality to alcoholism

1282
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,340
and then congratulates himself

1283
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:51,400
on having the conversation.

1284
01:02:51,860 --> 01:02:53,660
I'm a deeply religious man

1285
01:02:53,660 --> 01:02:55,880
and my religion says

1286
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:57,780
man and a woman,

1287
01:02:58,360 --> 01:03:01,400
that is the basic building block of family.

1288
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:03,480
And that's what I believe,

1289
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:05,480
but I also am,

1290
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:10,100
and I also know God created you

1291
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:11,740
just like he created me,

1292
01:03:12,100 --> 01:03:13,080
flaws and all.

1293
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,860
You know, I believe I have a gene,

1294
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:17,760
they've never found it,

1295
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:21,300
that makes me very susceptible to alcoholism

1296
01:03:21,300 --> 01:03:23,100
because it runs in my family.

1297
01:03:23,660 --> 01:03:24,600
So does craziness,

1298
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,480
but it runs in my family.

1299
01:03:26,780 --> 01:03:28,840
Well, Dave smiles and nods,

1300
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,640
probably because he's thinking about

1301
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,900
how much he enjoys the taste of boots.

1302
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,240
Usually I just take out a picture

1303
01:03:36,300 --> 01:03:39,020
of me and DeSantis and then we're good

1304
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,200
because they get it, they get it,

1305
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:42,860
that's my governor, yeah.

1306
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:45,540
I think a lot of straight people look at Dave Rubin

1307
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,640
and they see, finally,

1308
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:49,960
a reasonable gay person

1309
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,080
who doesn't scream,

1310
01:03:51,540 --> 01:03:53,880
beg it, at everyone who disagrees

1311
01:03:53,880 --> 01:03:56,620
and can actually have a civil conversation.

1312
01:03:56,980 --> 01:03:58,340
But that's not what I see.

1313
01:03:58,560 --> 01:03:59,740
I look at Dave Rubin

1314
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:02,000
and I see a sabineless,

1315
01:04:02,300 --> 01:04:03,900
boot-licking doormat

1316
01:04:03,900 --> 01:04:05,960
who won't even defend his own family.

1317
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:06,060
who won't even defend his own family.

1318
01:04:06,060 --> 01:04:06,820
who won't even defend his own family.

1319
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:09,600
from the most fundamental disrespect.

1320
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,440
I also can't help but notice

1321
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:14,220
that none of these civil conversations

1322
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:16,560
seem to change anyone's mind.

1323
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:18,940
Persuasion is more complicated

1324
01:04:18,940 --> 01:04:21,440
and less rational than people think.

1325
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:25,180
Megan often says that she was de-radicalized on Twitter,

1326
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:27,300
but if you read her book carefully,

1327
01:04:27,300 --> 01:04:30,100
you'll notice that that's not exactly true.

1328
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,900
The major precipitating event

1329
01:04:31,900 --> 01:04:33,820
for Megan's crisis of faith

1330
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,760
was her mother's mistreatment

1331
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:38,420
at the hands of an increasingly misogynistic

1332
01:04:38,420 --> 01:04:39,840
church leadership

1333
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,460
that made Megan feel like she was the victim

1334
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,800
of the church for once.

1335
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,960
She says of the church discipline,

1336
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,960
For the first time in my life,

1337
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,800
the accused were people I lived with

1338
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,380
and knew most intimately,

1339
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:52,800
and I knew that the judgments

1340
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,680
leveled by the elders were wrong.

1341
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,560
I could no longer blindly trust

1342
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:58,300
the judgment of these men.

1343
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:01,000
So she finally experienced firsthand

1344
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:03,600
what it's like to be the victim of her family.

1345
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,600
She stopped voting for the leopards-eating,

1346
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:07,220
people's faces party

1347
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:09,640
only when the leopards ate her face.

1348
01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,900
It also seems relevant to notice

1349
01:05:11,900 --> 01:05:14,840
that the people who had calm, civil conversations

1350
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:18,440
with Megan on Twitter were generally not gay people,

1351
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:21,640
the people most affected by her family's violent rhetoric.

1352
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:23,560
They were mostly straight men,

1353
01:05:23,560 --> 01:05:25,800
like director Kevin Smith,

1354
01:05:25,800 --> 01:05:28,220
who started hashtag SaveMegan

1355
01:05:28,220 --> 01:05:31,680
because, quote, she's hot.

1356
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:35,300
There's often an erotic component to persuasion,

1357
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,220
and that certainly seems to be the case with Megan

1358
01:05:38,220 --> 01:05:42,000
because one of the people who helped de-radicalize her

1359
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,760
is now her husband.

1360
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,960
And I feel like that's a relevant detail

1361
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:49,180
if we're trying to understand the role of reason and emotion

1362
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:51,680
in de-radicalization experiences.

1363
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:53,960
I think this experience is usually more

1364
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:56,380
akin to religious conversion

1365
01:05:56,380 --> 01:05:58,600
than it is to logical reasoning.

1366
01:05:58,600 --> 01:06:00,140
There's also a world of difference

1367
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,760
between the mostly private conversations

1368
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:04,920
that actually lead people to reflect on their beliefs,

1369
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:07,920
and the spectacle of public debate.

1370
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,340
Ben Shapiro is never going to become less homophobic

1371
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:15,300
because he livestreamed a civil conversation with Dave Rubin.

1372
01:06:15,300 --> 01:06:17,880
So who is this conversation even for?

1373
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:20,460
Well, obviously, it's for the audience.

1374
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:24,720
I think these civil conversations basically function

1375
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,460
to reassure a homophobic audience

1376
01:06:27,460 --> 01:06:31,580
that just because they disagree with the lifestyle

1377
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:34,380
doesn't mean that they hate gay people.

1378
01:06:34,380 --> 01:06:35,760
Look at Ben Shapiro.

1379
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,540
He is friends with a gay.

1380
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:40,580
Public debate is one way that we define the limits

1381
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:42,140
of the Overton window,

1382
01:06:42,140 --> 01:06:45,760
the range of beliefs that are socially acceptable to hold.

1383
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:48,140
So often people who want to promote bigotry

1384
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,380
will use debate as a foot in the door.

1385
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:54,220
It's a way of establishing that their prejudices

1386
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:56,220
are within the realm of reasonable

1387
01:06:56,220 --> 01:06:58,300
and socially accepted opinion.

1388
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:02,000
Here's obsessive anti-trans bigot Graham Linehan

1389
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,920
in a fury that a drag queen,

1390
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,500
that a drag queen is on Doctor Who

1391
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:10,040
without the British public having a proper debate

1392
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,420
about these issues.

1393
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:14,720
Now, why do we need to have a proper debate

1394
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,540
about whether drag queens should be allowed on television

1395
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,920
when drag performance has been a staple

1396
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:22,460
of British entertainment

1397
01:07:22,460 --> 01:07:24,920
since at least the time of Shakespeare?

1398
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:27,000
Life is a joke, that's just begun.

1399
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:29,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha, high five.

1400
01:07:29,720 --> 01:07:31,580
Three little maids from school.

1401
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,040
Fishy, fishy, fishy, fish.

1402
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,920
As I am man,

1403
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:41,680
my state is desperate for my master's love.

1404
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,920
As I am woman, now alas the day.

1405
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,120
Bigots like Graham want a perpetual debate

1406
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:50,680
on their own terms

1407
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:53,840
because this is how they dignify their pearl clutching.

1408
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:55,880
It's how they convince the public

1409
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,380
that their moral panic about drag queens on TV

1410
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,800
is actually a valid concern.

1411
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,540
Rather than the tedious,

1412
01:08:03,540 --> 01:08:07,160
small-minded whining about nothing that it really is.

1413
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:09,960
Having the debate on a bigot's terms

1414
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,540
is not a good way to win people over

1415
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:14,300
unless you're really skilled

1416
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:16,460
in the art of humiliating people,

1417
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:19,160
which most of the time is what public debate

1418
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:20,700
is actually about.

1419
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,340
This is something that J.K. Rowling

1420
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,240
doesn't seem to understand.

1421
01:08:24,240 --> 01:08:26,380
In the witch trials of J.K. Rowling,

1422
01:08:26,380 --> 01:08:30,580
Joro takes a contradictory stance on deplatforming.

1423
01:08:30,580 --> 01:08:33,300
She brings up right-wing provocateur,

1424
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:34,600
Milo Yiannopoulos,

1425
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,180
saying that activists are making a strategic error

1426
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:42,060
and giving Milo power by protesting his events,

1427
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,060
making him look dangerous and sexy.

1428
01:08:45,060 --> 01:08:48,000
But when trans people try to deplatform TERFs,

1429
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:50,960
Rowling characterizes this as silencing.

1430
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,420
So is deplatforming a strategic error

1431
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:55,680
that gives power to your opponent,

1432
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:58,260
or is it a powerful tactic of silencing?

1433
01:08:58,260 --> 01:08:59,720
I find Rowling's conviction

1434
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:01,960
that we ought to debate Milo Yiannopoulos

1435
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:03,260
really out of touch.

1436
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,000
Milo Yiannopoulos doesn't have reasons

1437
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,180
for the things he does.

1438
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:10,540
He has strategies for humiliating people.

1439
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,460
I've taken some time out of my busy schedule,

1440
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,540
being fabulous and doing my hair,

1441
01:09:14,540 --> 01:09:15,880
to prepare a speech for you.

1442
01:09:15,880 --> 01:09:17,260
Well, a few remarks, really.

1443
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,220
Feminism is cancer.

1444
01:09:21,220 --> 01:09:22,600
Thank you very much.

1445
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,640
To again quote Ian Danskin,

1446
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:26,800
you can't really reason with someone

1447
01:09:26,800 --> 01:09:29,180
who thinks that feminism is cancer,

1448
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:31,340
because you don't reason with cancer.

1449
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,600
You eradicate it.

1450
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,760
Rowling objects to the slogan,

1451
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:37,640
no debate, in the strongest possible terms.

1452
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:40,720
And then we come to the famous two-word slogan,

1453
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,760
the stock phrase, no debate, no debate, no debate.

1454
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:45,520
We hear it all the time.

1455
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,300
That alarms me, really alarms me.

1456
01:09:49,300 --> 01:09:52,680
I can't think of a purer instance of authoritarianism

1457
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:53,560
than no debate.

1458
01:09:53,560 --> 01:09:54,720
It's kind of amazing to me

1459
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:57,680
that someone could think angry trans people on Twitter

1460
01:09:57,680 --> 01:10:00,840
are the purest example of authoritarianism.

1461
01:10:00,840 --> 01:10:02,440
I truly hope that one day,

1462
01:10:02,440 --> 01:10:06,400
I am privileged enough to be capable of such a perspective.

1463
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,780
Before I move on, I do want to clarify

1464
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,680
that I do think there are trans issues

1465
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:15,280
that are legitimately debatable by people who are not bigots.

1466
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:18,940
In my opinion, trans women and women's sports

1467
01:10:18,940 --> 01:10:20,400
is one of those issues.

1468
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,820
But it's a complicated issue.

1469
01:10:22,820 --> 01:10:26,740
Like, first of all, which sport are we talking about?

1470
01:10:26,740 --> 01:10:28,900
Are we talking about figure skating?

1471
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:30,940
Middle school field hockey?

1472
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:31,680
I see no reason why trans women and women's sports,

1473
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:34,640
I see no reason why trans girls should be excluded from that.

1474
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:37,180
But if we're talking about professional weightlifting,

1475
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:40,220
well, then it seems plausible that trans women

1476
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:42,060
who have been through male puberty

1477
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:45,440
may still retain some kind of group advantage.

1478
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:49,180
But not all trans women have experienced male puberty.

1479
01:10:49,180 --> 01:10:51,220
People are transitioning younger now,

1480
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,560
and that's another thing you have to consider.

1481
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:56,480
So I'm not against debating this issue.

1482
01:10:56,480 --> 01:11:00,480
I just want people to approach it with nuance and good faith.

1483
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:01,640
And currently, I'm not against it.

1484
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:04,220
A lot of the people who are vocally against

1485
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:08,020
trans women and women's sports sound like this.

1486
01:11:08,020 --> 01:11:12,300
And we will keep men out of women's sports.

1487
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,520
Right?

1488
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,760
How ridiculous.

1489
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:20,720
That will take place on day one.

1490
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,480
And I don't want to debate those people.

1491
01:11:22,480 --> 01:11:25,220
I want to serve them a banana creme pie.

1492
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:28,840
Chapter 6. Illiberal Methods.

1493
01:11:28,840 --> 01:11:31,520
One of J.K. Rowling's core complaints about men being too aggressive is that,

1494
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:37,880
the trans rights movement is she sees it as illiberal in its methods so when i first became

1495
01:11:37,880 --> 01:11:45,240
interested and then deeply troubled by what i saw as a cultural movement that was illiberal

1496
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:51,560
in its methods so what are these illiberal methods if you are saying this person is

1497
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:59,640
cancelled that is the language of a dictator it's true cancel culture is exactly how the third reich

1498
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:05,960
started first they cancelled the socialists and i did not speak out because the hashtag was trending

1499
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:08,760
but maybe we should see what an actual dictator thinks

1500
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:28,840
you know i can't help but wonder what counts as acceptable activist methods

1501
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:29,620
to an author from

1502
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:37,640
whom hermione protesting slavery was taking things too far i am fighting what i see as a powerful

1503
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:45,480
insidious misogynistic movement i do not see this particular movement as either benign or powerless

1504
01:12:45,480 --> 01:12:50,040
rowling seems to think that the trans rights movement is dangerous and authoritarian

1505
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:55,320
in some unprecedented way that makes it different from all past liberation movements

1506
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,840
but how what are these illiberal methods that distinguish trans

1507
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:04,860
rights activism from similar past movements canceling anita bryant was way more cancelled

1508
01:13:04,860 --> 01:13:10,680
than jk rowling ever will be boycotts boycotts have been a staple of every progressive movement

1509
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:16,280
in modern history disrupting feminist meetings disrupting feminist meetings is a feminist

1510
01:13:16,280 --> 01:13:22,600
tradition haven't you heard of the lavender menace in 1969 betty friedan author of the feminine mystique

1511
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:27,480
and founder of the national organization for women and second wave feminism in general coined the

1512
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:28,680
phrase lavender menace

1513
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:33,000
to describe the threat she believed that lesbians posed

1514
01:13:33,000 --> 01:13:34,260
to the women's movement.

1515
01:13:34,260 --> 01:13:37,680
Friedan was worried that being associated with lesbians

1516
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,580
would make it easy to dismiss the movement

1517
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,600
as a bunch of mannish man-haters.

1518
01:13:41,600 --> 01:13:44,500
This understandably pissed off a bunch of lesbians

1519
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,220
who attended the second Congress to Unite Women in 1970

1520
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,880
to stage what used to be known as a ZAP,

1521
01:13:50,880 --> 01:13:54,100
a disruptive public protest designed to draw attention

1522
01:13:54,100 --> 01:13:55,540
to gay rights issues.

1523
01:13:55,540 --> 01:13:57,720
Think glitter bombing, think pies.

1524
01:13:57,720 --> 01:13:59,560
Half aggression, half whimsy.

1525
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,720
Like that time the Lesbian Avengers zapped

1526
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,120
Rowling's friend Baroness Nicholson's house,

1527
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:05,520
demanding that she resign.

1528
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,560
This podcast has pushed me over the edge.

1529
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:11,100
Centrism has gone too far, and I am now pro-cancel culture.

1530
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,020
So just as the meeting was beginning,

1531
01:14:13,020 --> 01:14:16,460
a group of 17 lesbians wearing Lavender Menace t-shirts

1532
01:14:16,460 --> 01:14:19,440
switched off the lights, pulled the plug on the mic,

1533
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:22,260
and charged down the aisles, laughing and screaming.

1534
01:14:22,260 --> 01:14:25,060
Their leader, Rita Mae Brown, took the mic and yelled,

1535
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,960
"'This conference won't proceed

1536
01:14:26,960 --> 01:14:27,720
"'until we talk about it.'

1537
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:29,760
"'Let's talk about lesbians and the women's movement.'"

1538
01:14:29,760 --> 01:14:31,840
One of the NOW organizers yelled back,

1539
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:34,760
"'I object to your coming in and taking over this meeting.

1540
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:36,560
"'You're acting like men.'"

1541
01:14:36,560 --> 01:14:38,340
Betty Friedan would later speculate

1542
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:40,680
that the lesbians were a CIA PSYOP

1543
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:43,180
designed to make the women's movement look bad.

1544
01:14:43,180 --> 01:14:46,100
So the Lavender Menace disrupted the feminist meeting

1545
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,920
using illiberal tactics,

1546
01:14:47,920 --> 01:14:50,060
not because they were against feminism,

1547
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:53,060
but because they wanted lesbian exclusionary feminists

1548
01:14:53,060 --> 01:14:54,100
to include them.

1549
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:55,680
It's the same thing that's happening today

1550
01:14:55,680 --> 01:14:57,680
when trans people disrupt feminist meetings.

1551
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,380
As J.K. Rowling puts it,

1552
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:01,260
interestingly neglecting to mention

1553
01:15:01,260 --> 01:15:03,220
which feminist meetings these are.

1554
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:05,560
I was starting to see activists behaving

1555
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:08,340
in a very aggressive way outside feminist meetings.

1556
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:11,140
There was a feminist meeting in which they were banging

1557
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,800
and kicking on windows, very threatening.

1558
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:17,020
There's a historical obliviousness to Rowling's idea

1559
01:15:17,020 --> 01:15:20,020
that trans activists are somehow more aggressive

1560
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,800
than similar past movements.

1561
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,920
Like she retweeted a transphobic gay man

1562
01:15:23,920 --> 01:15:26,340
called Dennis Noel Kavanaugh, who says,

1563
01:15:26,340 --> 01:15:27,560
all those gay rights movements,

1564
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,020
gay rights and AIDS protests,

1565
01:15:29,020 --> 01:15:31,360
I don't remember a single one

1566
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:34,320
where we intimidated or silenced a woman.

1567
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,600
Not a single one.

1568
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:38,800
Not a single one.

1569
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:40,440
Not a single one.

1570
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:45,440
Not a single one.

1571
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,140
Dennis has also tweeted that he preferred AIDS

1572
01:15:49,140 --> 01:15:50,520
to the trans movement.

1573
01:15:50,520 --> 01:15:53,140
And also, quote,

1574
01:15:53,140 --> 01:15:55,600
I will fucking nail you to a wall

1575
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,320
what you have done to these innocent women.

1576
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,700
what you have done to these innocent women.

1577
01:15:58,700 --> 01:16:01,820
Your mutilation of these little humand

1578
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:03,820
because they were gay will be nothing

1579
01:16:03,820 --> 01:16:08,360
compared to what I will do to you legally.

1580
01:16:08,360 --> 01:16:10,080
You think you are ghouls,

1581
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,860
wait till I deal with you bastard and I mean to.

1582
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:16,860
Dennis, it's time to log off, gorge.

1583
01:16:16,860 --> 01:16:19,900
I do wonder, does Dennis threatening to nail people

1584
01:16:19,900 --> 01:16:23,200
to a wall count as illiberal methods?

1585
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:25,280
I guess JK Rowling doesn't think so

1586
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:26,780
because she's never condemned it.

1587
01:16:26,780 --> 01:16:29,440
In fact, when Dennis's Twitter suspension ended,

1588
01:16:29,440 --> 01:16:31,620
she was right there to welcome him back.

1589
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,400
And she continues to retweet him.

1590
01:16:33,400 --> 01:16:35,080
I've always been happy to acknowledge

1591
01:16:35,080 --> 01:16:37,080
that angry trans people on Twitter

1592
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:39,080
sometimes take things too far.

1593
01:16:39,080 --> 01:16:42,320
Things like death threats or misogynistic insults,

1594
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,020
I don't support that and I've called it out in the past.

1595
01:16:45,020 --> 01:16:47,820
Like when the leftist streamer Vosh,

1596
01:16:47,820 --> 01:16:49,980
drama alert, who is not trans,

1597
01:16:49,980 --> 01:16:51,400
tweeted at JK Rowling,

1598
01:16:51,400 --> 01:16:54,860
women be quieter and start apologizing challenge.

1599
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:56,620
I called him out, tweeting,

1600
01:16:56,620 --> 01:17:00,120
doing edgy, ironic misogyny while defending trans people

1601
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:02,740
magnifies the grain of truth in what TERFs say

1602
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:05,580
about there being misogyny in trans activism.

1603
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,620
I tweeted that because I recognize

1604
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:09,820
that if people who are claiming to speak for you

1605
01:17:09,820 --> 01:17:12,120
are doing so in a misogynistic way,

1606
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:13,860
and if you let that slide,

1607
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:15,420
you're going to wake up one day to find

1608
01:17:15,420 --> 01:17:17,460
that you're in a misogynistic movement.

1609
01:17:17,460 --> 01:17:19,920
Of course, Vosh took the criticism really well,

1610
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,700
explaining that actually,

1611
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:25,080
I just didn't understand the complex tactical arguments

1612
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,460
for the moral necessity of being trans.

1613
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:28,420
Being misogynistic to JK Rowling.

1614
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,840
And then he accused me of cancel culturing him

1615
01:17:30,840 --> 01:17:31,840
while at the same time,

1616
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,620
literally telling his followers to publicly shame me.

1617
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:37,580
The more of you were in the replies being like,

1618
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,080
that's not what's happening right here.

1619
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,260
Like this is necessary, okay?

1620
01:17:41,260 --> 01:17:45,880
Publicly shame her into changing her mind on this.

1621
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:48,340
Then bringing up my past struggle with addiction.

1622
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:52,260
Move you off this site and into,

1623
01:17:52,260 --> 01:17:54,000
I don't want to bring up the substance abuse.

1624
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,300
So that pretty much confirmed to me that Vosh doesn't

1625
01:17:56,300 --> 01:17:58,640
actually care about advocating for trans people

1626
01:17:58,640 --> 01:18:00,920
and just uses trans rights as a pretext

1627
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,380
to act like a fucking dingus.

1628
01:18:02,380 --> 01:18:04,380
I won't tell you to publicly shame him though,

1629
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,180
because unlike Vosh, I would never sink to that.

1630
01:18:07,180 --> 01:18:09,800
The point I'm trying to make is I have no qualms

1631
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,000
about calling out people on my side

1632
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:14,420
whenever they go too far or cross a line

1633
01:18:14,420 --> 01:18:16,600
or do stupid tweets and then mansplain to me

1634
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:19,300
about how I don't understand tactical misogyny.

1635
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,140
Idiot.

1636
01:18:20,140 --> 01:18:22,260
But the same cannot be said of JK Rowling.

1637
01:18:22,260 --> 01:18:25,720
I have never once seen her call out any of the bigotry and

1638
01:18:25,720 --> 01:18:28,520
abusiveness that is absolutely rampant

1639
01:18:28,520 --> 01:18:30,260
in the gender-critical movement.

1640
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,520
There's a great video called JK Rowling's New Friends

1641
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:36,380
by YouTuber Sean that exposes the dishonesty

1642
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:40,180
of framing this conflict as meek, concerned feminists

1643
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,480
versus the abusive trans mob.

1644
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:45,560
A framing that the witch trials of JK Rowling accepts

1645
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,800
uncritically, citing numerous examples of death threats

1646
01:18:48,800 --> 01:18:51,060
and abusiveness from trans advocates.

1647
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:54,300
Things like, kill TERFs 2014.

1648
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:55,480
How about slowly

1649
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,280
and horrendously murder TERFs

1650
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,180
in saw-like torture machines and contraptions?

1651
01:19:00,180 --> 01:19:01,820
Now, I don't think anyone should joke

1652
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:03,900
about putting people in saw traps,

1653
01:19:03,900 --> 01:19:06,560
but also, how serious is this threat

1654
01:19:06,560 --> 01:19:09,560
that was posted to Tumblr in 2014?

1655
01:19:09,560 --> 01:19:11,780
Let's use our critical thinking skills here.

1656
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:16,140
Do you think that Jigsaw, the villain from the Saw movies,

1657
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:19,140
has a Tumblr account and is threatening TERFs?

1658
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,680
Or do you think this was posted by a 14-year-old?

1659
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:25,320
The podcast cites zero examples of death threats and abusiveness

1660
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,940
from anti-trans bigots.

1661
01:19:26,940 --> 01:19:30,120
And it's not exactly like you have to dig deep to find any.

1662
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:33,400
I can fill the screen up with examples just from people

1663
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:37,160
who JK Rowling has explicitly supported or interacted with.

1664
01:19:37,160 --> 01:19:40,820
I will drive you out into the desert and bury you 9 feet down,

1665
01:19:40,820 --> 01:19:43,440
one tweet says, from a fan of JK Rowling.

1666
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:47,080
First I'll set you on fire and piss on your half-alive corpse.

1667
01:19:47,080 --> 01:19:51,200
Fuck trans activism, fuck gender ideology, and fuck you.

1668
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:55,160
Another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,

1669
01:19:55,160 --> 01:19:55,200
another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,

1670
01:19:55,200 --> 01:19:55,280
another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,

1671
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:55,320
another threat from the same user is so graphically violent and sexual,

1672
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:59,860
I don't know if I can even read it aloud without violating the YouTube terms of service.

1673
01:19:59,860 --> 01:20:04,120
But threats like this from the gender critical side are simply not mentioned

1674
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:06,120
in the witch trials of JK Rowling.

1675
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:10,200
Both Rowling and Megan seem happy to cherry-pick threatening tweets

1676
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,440
and soundbites of shouting protesters

1677
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:14,860
Fuck you, you ugly piece of shit!

1678
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:18,200
You look like you got your teeth knocked out of your fucking flashes!

1679
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:22,200
as evidence that the trans movement is dangerous and insidious to the core.

1680
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:25,200
But this exact technique has been used against literally

1681
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,080
every liberation movement in world history.

1682
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:31,580
For example, let's consider Reclaim the Night,

1683
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:34,700
the protest movement against sexual violence in Britain,

1684
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:38,780
which first got JK Rowling interested in feminism in the 1970s.

1685
01:20:38,780 --> 01:20:42,540
Here's how The Guardian, Britain's spineless centrist paper of note,

1686
01:20:42,540 --> 01:20:45,900
covered a Reclaim the Night protest in 1979.

1687
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:49,620
Chanting slogans against rape seems reasonable to promote awareness,

1688
01:20:49,620 --> 01:20:53,000
but what about the hissing and swearing at any innocent male,

1689
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:55,160
and cries of castrate men?

1690
01:20:55,160 --> 01:20:59,160
We were all sympathetic to the principles of the women's liberation movement,

1691
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:03,660
but we left the crowd of shouting, torch-bearing women when it became clear

1692
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:09,160
that my friend's brother was running the risk of personal mutilation if he remained with us.

1693
01:21:09,160 --> 01:21:11,160
The protesters were allegedly singing,

1694
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:16,160
Here I stand, my knife in hand, free castration on demand.

1695
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,660
So this is how the British press covered the women's movement.

1696
01:21:19,660 --> 01:21:22,160
Angry, torch-bearing women screaming,

1697
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:23,660
Castrate men!

1698
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:25,160
Now, is that a fair representation?

1699
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:26,660
Of the women's movement?

1700
01:21:26,660 --> 01:21:30,660
Should we judge every movement by its most militant extremists?

1701
01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:34,160
Is it fair, say, to pretend that Valerie Solanus,

1702
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,160
who shot Andy Warhol,

1703
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:41,160
who advocated for male extermination in her Society for Cutting Up Men manifesto,

1704
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:43,660
is representative of feminism as a whole?

1705
01:21:43,660 --> 01:21:47,160
Many anti-feminists over the years have done exactly that.

1706
01:21:47,160 --> 01:21:49,160
But it's not fair, is it?

1707
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:52,660
So why does JK Rowling think it's fair to judge the trans movement

1708
01:21:52,660 --> 01:21:55,160
by the worst things trans people have ever tweeted?

1709
01:21:55,160 --> 01:21:57,160
I want her to choke on my fat trans dick.

1710
01:21:57,160 --> 01:21:59,660
And I made excuses for you then.

1711
01:21:59,660 --> 01:22:02,660
In the fourth episode of The Witch Trials of JK Rowling,

1712
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:06,160
Megan interviews New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg,

1713
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:09,160
who has written sympathetically about transphobic feminism.

1714
01:22:09,160 --> 01:22:12,160
There's a moment in this interview where Michelle kind of stumbles

1715
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:15,660
into an honest observation that I find fascinating.

1716
01:22:15,660 --> 01:22:18,160
Right, I mean, I think you'll often hear people say,

1717
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:21,160
you know, I'm not going to debate my basic humanity.

1718
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,160
And part of the difficulty is that there are indeed certain issues

1719
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:27,160
which we have sort of decided somewhat collectively

1720
01:22:27,160 --> 01:22:30,660
with some sort of consensus are beyond the realm of debate.

1721
01:22:30,660 --> 01:22:34,660
And I think that part of what is so difficult about this issue

1722
01:22:34,660 --> 01:22:37,660
is that there are certain people who think that this kind of consensus

1723
01:22:37,660 --> 01:22:41,660
can be imposed, maybe, as opposed to evolve organically.

1724
01:22:41,660 --> 01:22:47,660
And so they're sort of desperately trying to shore it up

1725
01:22:47,660 --> 01:22:50,160
in the hopes, I think, that if they can,

1726
01:22:50,160 --> 01:22:54,160
they will enjoy the same sort of assumed

1727
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:57,160
protection as other groups whose rights we've decided

1728
01:22:57,160 --> 01:23:00,660
are not up for public conversation.

1729
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:03,660
I think the problem is that we don't actually have a consensus.

1730
01:23:03,660 --> 01:23:06,660
So Michelle correctly observes that the reason trans people

1731
01:23:06,660 --> 01:23:09,660
are often reluctant to debate our rights is that we want

1732
01:23:09,660 --> 01:23:12,660
the same assumed protections as other groups whose rights

1733
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:15,160
liberals have decided are not up for debate.

1734
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:20,160
But then Michelle suggests that trans people have to debate our rights

1735
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:24,160
because there isn't a mainstream consensus that we deserve rights.

1736
01:23:24,160 --> 01:23:28,160
I am really curious to know how Michelle Goldberg thinks that past

1737
01:23:28,160 --> 01:23:30,160
liberation movements have succeeded.

1738
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:34,160
Like, does she think that women's suffrage just evolved organically?

1739
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:38,160
Did suffragettes just have calm, civil conversations about whether

1740
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:42,160
women are intellectually capable of voting until all the misogynists

1741
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,160
were rationally persuaded?

1742
01:23:44,160 --> 01:23:47,160
No, they stood up and demanded their right to vote,

1743
01:23:47,160 --> 01:23:50,160
sometimes violently, especially in the UK.

1744
01:23:50,160 --> 01:23:53,160
Like, people forget this, maybe because they were called suffragettes,

1745
01:23:53,160 --> 01:23:54,160
which is kind of a cute thing.

1746
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:57,160
But the suffragettes, they murdered people.

1747
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:59,160
They were suffragette terrorists.

1748
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,160
They broke windows.

1749
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:01,160
They bombed churches.

1750
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:03,160
They set fire to a theater.

1751
01:24:03,160 --> 01:24:08,160
In 1909, a suffragette attacked Winston Churchill with a horse whip.

1752
01:24:08,160 --> 01:24:09,160
Queen shit, honestly.

1753
01:24:09,160 --> 01:24:12,160
The English suffragette Mary Lee threw a fucking hatchet

1754
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,160
at the Prime Minister's head.

1755
01:24:14,160 --> 01:24:18,160
And my point is not to advocate terrorism or to excuse the terrorism

1756
01:24:18,160 --> 01:24:19,160
of past movements.

1757
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:22,160
I think these kinds of tactics have tended to turn people against

1758
01:24:22,160 --> 01:24:23,160
the movement.

1759
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:24,160
I don't think it's effective.

1760
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,160
But let's not pretend that past movements have never made demands

1761
01:24:27,160 --> 01:24:29,160
before everyone was ready.

1762
01:24:29,160 --> 01:24:32,160
Because there never has been and there never will be a time

1763
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:34,160
when everyone is ready.

1764
01:24:34,160 --> 01:24:37,160
I mean, Mary Wollstonecraft published The Vindication of the Rights

1765
01:24:37,160 --> 01:24:39,160
of Women in 1792.

1766
01:24:39,160 --> 01:24:43,160
And misogyny, in case you hadn't noticed, remains rampant.

1767
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:46,160
So there never has been a consensus about women's rights,

1768
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:48,160
and there probably never will be.

1769
01:24:48,160 --> 01:24:52,160
In fact, marginalized groups wouldn't need rights if there was a consensus

1770
01:24:52,160 --> 01:24:54,160
that we deserve rights.

1771
01:24:54,160 --> 01:24:57,160
The whole reason to have rights is to protect you from the kind of people

1772
01:24:57,160 --> 01:24:59,160
who think you shouldn't have them.

1773
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:02,160
I mean, it's a nice thought that we can just politely persuade everyone

1774
01:25:02,160 --> 01:25:06,160
to give us rights, but the reality is that's not how this works,

1775
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:07,160
and it never has been.

1776
01:25:07,160 --> 01:25:10,160
Like, how do these debate me centrists think that slavery ended

1777
01:25:10,160 --> 01:25:12,160
in the United States?

1778
01:25:12,160 --> 01:25:17,160
Well, between 1861 and 1865, there was a little event called

1779
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:19,160
the American Civil Debate.

1780
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,160
See what I'm holding in my hand?

1781
01:25:21,160 --> 01:25:24,160
This is a high-caliber idea that I picked off

1782
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:26,160
the polite discussion field of Manassas.

1783
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:29,160
Do you people think that American schools were integrated

1784
01:25:29,160 --> 01:25:32,160
because all the white people in the South were persuaded

1785
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,160
that segregation is bad?

1786
01:25:34,160 --> 01:25:35,160
No dum-dums.

1787
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:38,160
Eisenhower had to send in the 101st Airborne to enforce that shit

1788
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,160
at gunpoint.

1789
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,160
And my point is not to equate LGBT rights movements

1790
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:43,160
with black civil rights.

1791
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:47,160
I am aware that being a white queer person is not in any way equivalent

1792
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:49,160
to living in the aftermath of slavery.

1793
01:25:49,160 --> 01:25:51,160
I'm just saying that there's this tendency to

1794
01:25:51,160 --> 01:25:54,160
sanitize history, and to imagine that progress was smooth

1795
01:25:54,160 --> 01:25:58,160
and bloodless, that consensus evolved organically,

1796
01:25:58,160 --> 01:25:59,160
when it just didn't.

1797
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:02,160
And then people get the impression that current movements

1798
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:05,160
are somehow more militant than successful past movements

1799
01:26:05,160 --> 01:26:07,160
when they just aren't.

1800
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:11,160
I am fighting what I see as a powerful, insidious,

1801
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:15,160
misogynistic movement, a cultural movement that was

1802
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:17,160
illiberal in its methods.

1803
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:21,160
And I believe absolutely that there is something

1804
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:26,160
dangerous about this movement, and it must be challenged.

1805
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:28,160
Why is J.K. Rowling like this?

1806
01:26:32,160 --> 01:26:35,160
J.K. Rowling loves to quote radical feminist Andrea Dworkin,

1807
01:26:35,160 --> 01:26:38,160
whomst I've already mentioned a couple times in this video.

1808
01:26:38,160 --> 01:26:40,160
I myself favor violence.

1809
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:42,160
Deeply, I favor it.

1810
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:45,160
Dworkin is known for her extreme sex-negative views,

1811
01:26:45,160 --> 01:26:47,160
which I don't agree with.

1812
01:26:47,160 --> 01:26:50,160
But she was an interesting writer, one of those half-crazed,

1813
01:26:50,160 --> 01:26:55,160
savantes who gets in your head, who you can't stop thinking about.

1814
01:26:55,160 --> 01:26:59,160
In my opinion, Dworkin's best book is Right Wing Women,

1815
01:26:59,160 --> 01:27:04,160
published in 1983, the era of Phyllis Schlafly and Anita Bryant.

1816
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:07,160
Right Wing Women is an analysis of why so many women

1817
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:12,160
are drawn to conservative politics, seemingly against their own interests.

1818
01:27:12,160 --> 01:27:15,160
Anyone who's interested in understanding the gender-critical movement,

1819
01:27:15,160 --> 01:27:19,160
a crypto-reactionary backlash disguising itself as feminism,

1820
01:27:19,160 --> 01:27:21,160
should read this book.

1821
01:27:21,160 --> 01:27:22,160
In Dworkin's analysis,

1822
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:39,160
And conservative politics promises women meaning.

1823
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:54,160
The gender-critical movement offers women a brutally simple understanding of sex and gender.

1824
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:58,160
A woman is an adult human female.

1825
01:27:58,160 --> 01:28:02,160
Right-wing anti-trans activist Posey Parker has made this phrase

1826
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:05,160
into the motto of the gender-critical movement.

1827
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:08,160
Adult human female.

1828
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:14,160
It's on billboards, it's on t-shirts, it's on banners, signs, and tweets.

1829
01:28:14,160 --> 01:28:17,160
Presented with the authority of a dictionary definition,

1830
01:28:17,160 --> 01:28:21,160
it's rigid, it's orderly, it's immutable.

1831
01:28:21,160 --> 01:28:24,160
There are no exceptions, there are no blurred lines,

1832
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:26,160
there can be no change.

1833
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:31,160
This mantra is a defense against the conceptual instability and chaos

1834
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:33,160
that gender-criticals fear.

1835
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:37,160
The same fear that once drove homophobic women like Anita Bryant.

1836
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:40,160
Just biologically that God made mothers so that we could reproduce.

1837
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,160
Homosexuals cannot reproduce biologically.

1838
01:28:43,160 --> 01:28:47,160
Erasing the concept of sex removes the ability

1839
01:28:47,160 --> 01:28:50,160
of many to meaningfully discuss their lives.

1840
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:51,160
Dworkin says,

1841
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:53,160
Within the frame of male domination,

1842
01:28:53,160 --> 01:28:56,160
there is a good reason for women to hate homosexuality,

1843
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,160
both male and female.

1844
01:28:57,160 --> 01:29:00,160
Women are interchangeable as sex objects.

1845
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,160
Women are slightly less disposable as mothers.

1846
01:29:03,160 --> 01:29:06,160
The only dignity and value women get is as mothers.

1847
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:09,160
Having children is the one social contribution credited to women.

1848
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:12,160
It is the bedrock of women's social worth.

1849
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:15,160
Without childbearing, women know they have nothing.

1850
01:29:15,160 --> 01:29:17,160
Homosexuality for women means

1851
01:29:17,160 --> 01:29:19,160
having nothing. It means extinction.

1852
01:29:19,160 --> 01:29:22,160
Substitute transgenderism for homosexuality

1853
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:25,160
and you'll understand the gender-critical movement.

1854
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:29,160
J.K. Rowling's definition of woman is this.

1855
01:29:29,160 --> 01:29:33,160
The woman is the producer of the large gametes.

1856
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,160
The producer of the large gametes.

1857
01:29:36,160 --> 01:29:40,160
Rowling says her primary concern about young trans men

1858
01:29:40,160 --> 01:29:42,160
is the loss of fertility.

1859
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:45,160
Homosexuality, its rise in public visibility,

1860
01:29:45,160 --> 01:29:49,160
attempts to socially legitimize or protect it,

1861
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,160
makes women expendable.

1862
01:29:51,160 --> 01:29:53,160
The one thing women can do and be valued for

1863
01:29:53,160 --> 01:29:55,160
will no longer be valued.

1864
01:29:55,160 --> 01:29:58,160
Male homosexuality is especially terrifying

1865
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:01,160
because it suggests a world without women altogether.

1866
01:30:01,160 --> 01:30:03,160
A world in which women are extinct.

1867
01:30:03,160 --> 01:30:08,160
This exact fear appears frequently in gender-critical rhetoric.

1868
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:10,160
Trans activists are erasing women.

1869
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:13,160
They're erasing biological sex.

1870
01:30:13,160 --> 01:30:15,160
They're going to call us pregnant.

1871
01:30:15,160 --> 01:30:16,160
Pregnant people.

1872
01:30:16,160 --> 01:30:20,160
Confused girls are being robbed of their precious fertility.

1873
01:30:20,160 --> 01:30:23,160
Trans women are going to replace biological women.

1874
01:30:23,160 --> 01:30:26,160
As a woman, I feel threatened because biological men

1875
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,160
are aggressively replacing women.

1876
01:30:28,160 --> 01:30:30,160
You will not replace us!

1877
01:30:30,160 --> 01:30:33,160
Sometimes this paranoia ramps up to the point of obsession

1878
01:30:33,160 --> 01:30:36,160
and the results can be...dazzling.

1879
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:39,160
In September 2022, Maya Forstadter,

1880
01:30:39,160 --> 01:30:41,160
who you'll remember as the anti-trans activist

1881
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:44,160
whom J.K. Rowling came out as a TERF to defend,

1882
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:46,160
went on a full-blown Twitter rampage

1883
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:49,160
because the Hertfordshire County Libraries announced

1884
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:53,160
they were changing their children's storytime mascot

1885
01:30:53,160 --> 01:30:55,160
from the Bookstart Bear

1886
01:30:55,160 --> 01:30:57,160
If you don't know where this is going, strap in!

1887
01:30:57,160 --> 01:30:59,160
from the Bookstart Bear

1888
01:30:59,160 --> 01:31:03,160
to a bright, vibrant, gender-neutral creature

1889
01:31:03,160 --> 01:31:05,160
called Tala.

1890
01:31:05,160 --> 01:31:07,160
Are you enraged?

1891
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:11,160
If not, you haven't been spending enough time on Mumsnet.

1892
01:31:11,160 --> 01:31:13,160
Maya tweeted the words of an indignant mother

1893
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:15,160
who referred to Talia

1894
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:16,160
Wait, wasn't it Tala?

1895
01:31:16,160 --> 01:31:21,160
referring to Talia as a trans bear with they-them pronouns,

1896
01:31:21,160 --> 01:31:23,160
describing the mascot as

1897
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:26,160
ideological, creepy, and gaslighting.

1898
01:31:26,160 --> 01:31:30,160
I cannot express how upset I feel.

1899
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:33,160
The library jumped in to clarify that Tala,

1900
01:31:33,160 --> 01:31:34,160
not Talia,

1901
01:31:34,160 --> 01:31:35,160
isn't trans.

1902
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:37,160
They are an alien.

1903
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:40,160
Maya then demanded to know how this alien was birthed.

1904
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:42,160
Did it hatch from an egg?

1905
01:31:42,160 --> 01:31:44,160
Or was it born from a mama?

1906
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,160
Some people tried to reason with Maya.

1907
01:31:46,160 --> 01:31:48,160
There's an advantage in having a character

1908
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,160
that isn't identifiably male or female,

1909
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,160
as it can be equally relatable to either sex

1910
01:31:52,160 --> 01:31:54,160
and avoid promoting gender stereotypes.

1911
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:57,160
But Maya was not convinced.

1912
01:31:57,160 --> 01:31:59,160
It seems highly unlikely that an alien

1913
01:31:59,160 --> 01:32:03,160
that had evolved with such recognizable vertebrate body plan

1914
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:05,160
is not sexually reproducing.

1915
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:07,160
It's a relatable anthropomorphic character,

1916
01:32:07,160 --> 01:32:09,160
not a slime mold.

1917
01:32:09,160 --> 01:32:11,160
I need to know

1918
01:32:11,160 --> 01:32:13,160
how the alien fucks

1919
01:32:13,160 --> 01:32:15,160
right now.

1920
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,160
I said,

1921
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:17,160
I need to know

1922
01:32:17,160 --> 01:32:19,160
how the alien fucks

1923
01:32:19,160 --> 01:32:21,160
before I can show it

1924
01:32:21,160 --> 01:32:23,160
to my child.

1925
01:32:26,160 --> 01:32:30,160
When Twitter understandably laughed it up at Maya's expense,

1926
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:32,160
she just kept posting.

1927
01:32:32,160 --> 01:32:33,160
And she posted hard.

1928
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:36,160
Honestly, I don't know if I've ever seen anyone post so hard.

1929
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:38,160
In a lengthy diatribe,

1930
01:32:38,160 --> 01:32:40,160
Maya wrote about the miseries of new motherhood.

1931
01:32:40,160 --> 01:32:42,160
You are in charge of a baby.

1932
01:32:42,160 --> 01:32:44,160
You have never done this before.

1933
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:46,160
You haven't had a good night's sleep for months

1934
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,160
and won't for years.

1935
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:48,160
Everyone has an opinion

1936
01:32:48,160 --> 01:32:50,160
on what you are doing right and wrong,

1937
01:32:50,160 --> 01:32:52,160
and you've become invisible.

1938
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:53,160
You had politics.

1939
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,160
You had a career.

1940
01:32:54,160 --> 01:32:56,160
You had interests.

1941
01:32:56,160 --> 01:32:57,160
You had a sex life.

1942
01:32:57,160 --> 01:32:59,160
Now you have the daily needs

1943
01:32:59,160 --> 01:33:01,160
of a completely dependent person,

1944
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:02,160
and your world has shrunk.

1945
01:33:02,160 --> 01:33:04,160
The fact that these men

1946
01:33:04,160 --> 01:33:06,160
and the young women that cheer them on

1947
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:08,160
think this is so laughable

1948
01:33:08,160 --> 01:33:10,160
reflects society's disdain.

1949
01:33:10,160 --> 01:33:11,160
Disdain for mothers.

1950
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:13,160
This is what it means to say

1951
01:33:13,160 --> 01:33:15,160
a woman is not a feeling or a costume.

1952
01:33:15,160 --> 01:33:17,160
This is why the hub of the resistance

1953
01:33:17,160 --> 01:33:19,160
is on Mumsnet.

1954
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:22,160
So, I am fascinated by this thread.

1955
01:33:22,160 --> 01:33:24,160
I think it's one of the most revealing texts

1956
01:33:24,160 --> 01:33:26,160
in gender-critical history.

1957
01:33:26,160 --> 01:33:27,160
Because you know what?

1958
01:33:27,160 --> 01:33:30,160
Maya Forsyter actually does

1959
01:33:30,160 --> 01:33:32,160
have valid concerns.

1960
01:33:32,160 --> 01:33:34,160
But the concerns she has that are valid

1961
01:33:34,160 --> 01:33:36,160
have nothing to do with trans people.

1962
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:38,160
And they definitely have nothing to do

1963
01:33:38,160 --> 01:33:39,160
with an adorable,

1964
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,160
adorable cartoon alien.

1965
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:43,160
Honestly, reading this,

1966
01:33:43,160 --> 01:33:45,160
I have some concerns.

1967
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:46,160
Concerns like,

1968
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,160
where is Maya's husband?

1969
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,160
I know she has one.

1970
01:33:50,160 --> 01:33:52,160
Isn't raising children supposed to be

1971
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:53,160
a mutual project?

1972
01:33:53,160 --> 01:33:56,160
No one should have to feel this alone,

1973
01:33:56,160 --> 01:33:57,160
raising children.

1974
01:33:57,160 --> 01:33:59,160
That is a valid concern.

1975
01:33:59,160 --> 01:34:01,160
Oh my god, we actually found one.

1976
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:02,160
It's like finding El Dorado.

1977
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,160
A valid concern.

1978
01:34:04,160 --> 01:34:06,160
A valid concern.

1979
01:34:06,160 --> 01:34:08,160
Isn't what's going on here that Maya

1980
01:34:08,160 --> 01:34:10,160
is taking legitimate feelings of being

1981
01:34:10,160 --> 01:34:12,160
overburdened and underappreciated

1982
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:14,160
and displacing those feelings onto

1983
01:34:14,160 --> 01:34:15,160
transgender people?

1984
01:34:15,160 --> 01:34:17,160
This is exactly how the gender-critical

1985
01:34:17,160 --> 01:34:18,160
movement recruits.

1986
01:34:18,160 --> 01:34:20,160
By providing a scapegoat

1987
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,160
to frustrated women.

1988
01:34:22,160 --> 01:34:24,160
It's not your husband's neglect.

1989
01:34:24,160 --> 01:34:26,160
It's not the increasing atomization of society.

1990
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:28,160
It's not the indignities of aging.

1991
01:34:28,160 --> 01:34:30,160
It's Tala,

1992
01:34:30,160 --> 01:34:32,160
the non-binary alien,

1993
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:34,160
with its dungarees and

1994
01:34:34,160 --> 01:34:36,160
smug aura of gender neutrality.

1995
01:34:36,160 --> 01:34:38,160
Mumsnet is the hub!

1996
01:34:38,160 --> 01:34:40,160
The hub of the resistance

1997
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:42,160
to non-binary cartoons.

1998
01:34:42,160 --> 01:34:43,160
It's too much.

1999
01:34:43,160 --> 01:34:44,160
These people are too much.

2000
01:34:44,160 --> 01:34:45,160
Okay, we have to be serious now.

2001
01:34:45,160 --> 01:34:47,160
The political right also promises women

2002
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:49,160
safety and security.

2003
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:52,160
For women, the world is a very dangerous place.

2004
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,160
The right acknowledges the reality of danger,

2005
01:34:54,160 --> 01:34:56,160
the validity of fear.

2006
01:34:56,160 --> 01:34:58,160
The right then manipulates the fear.

2007
01:34:58,160 --> 01:35:00,160
Women fear and resent male violence,

2008
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,160
which they're most likely to experience

2009
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,160
from the men closest to them.

2010
01:35:04,160 --> 01:35:07,160
Boyfriends, husbands, and fathers.

2011
01:35:07,160 --> 01:35:10,160
They're most likely to be killed by sexual partners.

2012
01:35:10,160 --> 01:35:13,160
But the need to survive in a male-dominated society

2013
01:35:13,160 --> 01:35:16,160
means that women's legitimate fears and resentments

2014
01:35:16,160 --> 01:35:19,160
often cannot be directed at the men with power.

2015
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:22,160
Inevitably, this causes women to take the rage

2016
01:35:22,160 --> 01:35:24,160
and contempt they feel

2017
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,160
for the men who actually abuse them,

2018
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:27,160
those close to them,

2019
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:29,160
and project it onto others.

2020
01:35:29,160 --> 01:35:32,160
Those far away, foreign, or different.

2021
01:35:32,160 --> 01:35:34,160
And this displacement of rage

2022
01:35:34,160 --> 01:35:36,160
is just transparently what's going on

2023
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:38,160
with J.K. Rowling.

2024
01:35:38,160 --> 01:35:41,160
In her essay about sex and gender issues,

2025
01:35:41,160 --> 01:35:44,160
Rowling speculates that trans men are transitioning

2026
01:35:44,160 --> 01:35:47,160
to be the son her father wanted.

2027
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:49,160
I really felt the rejection of my father,

2028
01:35:49,160 --> 01:35:51,160
and that is one of the things that maybe leads

2029
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:53,160
someone going into homosexuality.

2030
01:35:53,160 --> 01:35:55,160
And she describes the lingering trauma

2031
01:35:55,160 --> 01:35:57,160
from her first violent marriage.

2032
01:35:57,160 --> 01:35:59,160
The marriage at this point has turned very violent

2033
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,160
and very controlling.

2034
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:05,160
And that, she says, is why she decided to speak out

2035
01:36:05,160 --> 01:36:07,160
against the transgender movement.

2036
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:10,160
If you try to understand this rationally,

2037
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,160
it looks like a total non sequitur.

2038
01:36:12,160 --> 01:36:14,160
But if you look at it emotionally,

2039
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,160
there's a kind of logic to it.

2040
01:36:16,160 --> 01:36:18,160
The existence of the dangerous outsider

2041
01:36:18,160 --> 01:36:20,160
always functions for women simultaneously

2042
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:24,160
as deception, diversion, painkiller, and threat.

2043
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,160
Women cling to irrational hatreds

2044
01:36:26,160 --> 01:36:28,160
focused particularly on the unfamiliar,

2045
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:30,160
so that they will not murder their fathers,

2046
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:33,160
husbands, sons, brothers, lovers,

2047
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,160
the men with whom they are intimate,

2048
01:36:35,160 --> 01:36:37,160
those who do hurt them.

2049
01:36:37,160 --> 01:36:40,160
In the 1970s, many conservative women

2050
01:36:40,160 --> 01:36:43,160
displaced this rage onto lesbians,

2051
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,160
the threatening outsider of the day.

2052
01:36:45,160 --> 01:36:49,160
Dworkin attended the National Women's Conference in 1977,

2053
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:51,160
where she spoke to a lot of women

2054
01:36:51,160 --> 01:36:53,160
about their fear of lesbians.

2055
01:36:53,160 --> 01:36:55,160
Right-wing women consistently spoke to me

2056
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,160
about lesbians as if lesbians were rapists,

2057
01:36:58,160 --> 01:37:00,160
certified committers of sexual assault

2058
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,160
against women and girls.

2059
01:37:01,160 --> 01:37:04,160
To them, the lesbian was inherently monstrous,

2060
01:37:04,160 --> 01:37:07,160
experienced almost as a demonic sexual force

2061
01:37:07,160 --> 01:37:09,160
hovering closer and closer.

2062
01:37:09,160 --> 01:37:11,160
She was the dangerous intruder,

2063
01:37:11,160 --> 01:37:14,160
encroaching, threatening by her very presence

2064
01:37:14,160 --> 01:37:17,160
a sexual order that cannot bear scrutiny

2065
01:37:17,160 --> 01:37:19,160
or withstand challenge.

2066
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:21,160
It's almost surreal to read this

2067
01:37:21,160 --> 01:37:23,160
because of how precisely it describes

2068
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:26,160
how gender criticals talk about trans women.

2069
01:37:26,160 --> 01:37:28,160
Pronouns are like Rohypnol.

2070
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,160
They dull your defenses.

2071
01:37:30,160 --> 01:37:32,160
They change your inhibitions.

2072
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,160
They're meant to.

2073
01:37:33,160 --> 01:37:36,160
Now, it's true that trans-exclusionary radical feminism

2074
01:37:36,160 --> 01:37:41,160
began as an offshoot of far-left lesbian separatism,

2075
01:37:41,160 --> 01:37:45,160
with academic feminist Janice Raymond writing in 1979

2076
01:37:45,160 --> 01:37:48,160
that transsexualism should be morally mandated

2077
01:37:48,160 --> 01:37:50,160
out of existence.

2078
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:53,160
But the gender critical movement was always destined

2079
01:37:53,160 --> 01:37:55,160
to become a right-wing movement

2080
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,160
because it has the structure of a right-wing movement.

2081
01:37:58,160 --> 01:38:01,160
Taking women's fear and rage toward familiar men

2082
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:05,160
and displacing it onto an unfamiliar outsider.

2083
01:38:05,160 --> 01:38:08,160
The momentum behind this is just too ripe an opportunity

2084
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:10,160
for conservatives to pass up.

2085
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:11,160
As Dworkin says,

2086
01:38:11,160 --> 01:38:14,160
Because women so displace their rage,

2087
01:38:14,160 --> 01:38:17,160
they are easily controlled and manipulated haters.

2088
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:20,160
Women require symbols of danger that justify their fear.

2089
01:38:20,160 --> 01:38:23,160
The right provides these symbols of danger

2090
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:26,160
by designating clearly defined groups of outsiders

2091
01:38:26,160 --> 01:38:27,160
as sources of danger.

2092
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:30,160
In the 2020s, anti-trans bigotry has become a trend.

2093
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:34,160
A keystone of Conservative Party platforms,

2094
01:38:34,160 --> 01:38:35,160
both in the UK,

2095
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:36,160
where Lee Anderson,

2096
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:38,160
Deputy Chair of the Conservative Party,

2097
01:38:38,160 --> 01:38:41,160
predicts that the next election will be won on

2098
01:38:41,160 --> 01:38:44,160
Probably a mix of culture wars and trans debate.

2099
01:38:44,160 --> 01:38:45,160
and in the US,

2100
01:38:45,160 --> 01:38:48,160
where the ACLU is currently tracking more than

2101
01:38:48,160 --> 01:38:51,160
450 anti-LGBT bills,

2102
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:55,160
including more than 130 gender-affirming care bans,

2103
01:38:55,160 --> 01:38:57,160
51 trans sports bans,

2104
01:38:57,160 --> 01:38:58,160
40 drag bans,

2105
01:38:58,160 --> 01:39:00,160
29 trans bathroom bans,

2106
01:39:00,160 --> 01:39:01,160
and 24

2107
01:39:01,160 --> 01:39:04,160
and 21 bans defining trans people out of the law.

2108
01:39:04,160 --> 01:39:07,160
Republicans have escalated anti-trans rhetoric

2109
01:39:07,160 --> 01:39:09,160
to eliminationist extremes

2110
01:39:09,160 --> 01:39:12,160
that have most trans people in this country

2111
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:15,160
living in a constant state of fear for our future.

2112
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:18,160
Transgenderism must be eradicated

2113
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:20,160
from public life entirely.

2114
01:39:20,160 --> 01:39:22,160
The left is attacking our children,

2115
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:24,160
pushing sex talk,

2116
01:39:24,160 --> 01:39:26,160
transgender extremism,

2117
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,160
and noxious politics in our schools.

2118
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:30,160
We should reject this demonic assault

2119
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:32,160
on the innocence of our children

2120
01:39:32,160 --> 01:39:34,160
and stand fast against leftist efforts

2121
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:37,160
to mutilate their bodies and minds.

2122
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,160
Stop confusing our babies

2123
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:43,160
with your groomer gender ideologue.

2124
01:39:43,160 --> 01:39:46,160
I will revoke every Biden policy

2125
01:39:46,160 --> 01:39:48,160
promoting the chemical castration

2126
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,160
and sexual mutilization

2127
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:54,160
of our youth,

2128
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:57,160
and ask Congress to send me a bill

2129
01:39:57,160 --> 01:39:59,160
prohibiting child sexual mutilation

2130
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:02,160
in all 50 states.

2131
01:40:02,160 --> 01:40:04,160
On day one, I will revoke

2132
01:40:04,160 --> 01:40:06,160
Joe Biden's cruel policies

2133
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:09,160
on so-called gender-affirming care.

2134
01:40:09,160 --> 01:40:10,160
Ridiculous.

2135
01:40:10,160 --> 01:40:12,160
I will sign a new executive order

2136
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,160
instructing every federal agency

2137
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:16,160
to cease all programs

2138
01:40:16,160 --> 01:40:18,160
that promote the concept of sex

2139
01:40:18,160 --> 01:40:21,160
and gender transition at any age.

2140
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:23,160
A few gender criticals

2141
01:40:23,160 --> 01:40:24,160
still want to insist

2142
01:40:24,160 --> 01:40:26,160
they have nothing to do

2143
01:40:26,160 --> 01:40:28,160
with right-wing anti-trans bigots.

2144
01:40:28,160 --> 01:40:29,160
Like Helen Lewis.

2145
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,160
I mean, TERF is basically witch.

2146
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:33,160
Who attempts in her interview

2147
01:40:33,160 --> 01:40:35,160
in the witch trials of J.K. Rowling

2148
01:40:35,160 --> 01:40:37,160
to distinguish between the transphobia

2149
01:40:37,160 --> 01:40:38,160
of the far right

2150
01:40:38,160 --> 01:40:39,160
and that of feminists.

2151
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,160
I think the hardest thing

2152
01:40:41,160 --> 01:40:42,160
for outsiders to understand

2153
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:44,160
is that there are two different arguments going on.

2154
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,160
One is the traditional conservative right argument

2155
01:40:47,160 --> 01:40:49,160
which is anti-LGBT.

2156
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:51,160
The other one is a criticism from the left

2157
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,160
in which it says

2158
01:40:53,160 --> 01:40:56,160
sometimes male people and female people

2159
01:40:56,160 --> 01:40:57,160
have different interests.

2160
01:40:57,160 --> 01:41:00,160
No matter how the male people identify.

2161
01:41:00,160 --> 01:41:01,160
But as a trans person,

2162
01:41:01,160 --> 01:41:02,160
I don't care

2163
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,160
whether you justify your transphobia

2164
01:41:04,160 --> 01:41:06,160
in the name of protecting women

2165
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:08,160
or protecting children.

2166
01:41:08,160 --> 01:41:10,160
Whether it's radical feminist Janice Raymond

2167
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,160
calling for transsexualism

2168
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:14,160
to be morally mandated out of existence

2169
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:17,160
or conservative Catholic Michael Knowles

2170
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,160
calling for transgenderism

2171
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,160
to be eradicated from public life

2172
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:23,160
is the same repulsive bigotry to me.

2173
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:24,160
And in any case,

2174
01:41:24,160 --> 01:41:26,160
the gender critical movement

2175
01:41:26,160 --> 01:41:27,160
has recently reached

2176
01:41:27,160 --> 01:41:29,160
an implicit consensus

2177
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:30,160
that they're mostly done

2178
01:41:30,160 --> 01:41:32,160
pretending to be feminist.

2179
01:41:32,160 --> 01:41:34,160
The rising star of the movement

2180
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:35,160
Posey Parker

2181
01:41:35,160 --> 01:41:37,160
aka Kelly J. Keene-Minchel

2182
01:41:37,160 --> 01:41:39,160
rejects feminism entirely.

2183
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,160
Do you call yourself a feminist now?

2184
01:41:41,160 --> 01:41:42,160
No.

2185
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:43,160
Did you ever call yourself a feminist?

2186
01:41:43,160 --> 01:41:45,160
I probably did for a short time.

2187
01:41:45,160 --> 01:41:46,160
But so you wouldn't be

2188
01:41:46,160 --> 01:41:48,160
like a Julie Bindel type feminist?

2189
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,160
No, well some feminists,

2190
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:50,160
I mean Julie Bindel

2191
01:41:50,160 --> 01:41:53,160
has been critical of mothers in the past

2192
01:41:53,160 --> 01:41:55,160
and I think that's a theme

2193
01:41:55,160 --> 01:41:56,160
flowing through feminism.

2194
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:58,160
I'm not a feminist!

2195
01:41:58,160 --> 01:41:59,160
I'm not a feminist!

2196
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:01,160
This is not Andrea Dworkin.

2197
01:42:01,160 --> 01:42:03,160
This is Phyllis Schlafly.

2198
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:05,160
Parker's campaign is currently funded

2199
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:07,160
by the right wing CPAC.

2200
01:42:07,160 --> 01:42:08,160
CPAC came along

2201
01:42:08,160 --> 01:42:10,160
and said that they would sponsor our events

2202
01:42:10,160 --> 01:42:12,160
and cover all of our insurance

2203
01:42:12,160 --> 01:42:14,160
throughout our whole trip

2204
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:16,160
which is really kind of them.

2205
01:42:16,160 --> 01:42:18,160
But what we would need to do

2206
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:19,160
is we would need to show

2207
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:21,160
that we were working for them,

2208
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:22,160
working with them.

2209
01:42:22,160 --> 01:42:24,160
She has no qualms about collaborating

2210
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:26,160
with far right white nationalists.

2211
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:28,160
I want to talk about Marjorie Taylor Greene.

2212
01:42:28,160 --> 01:42:30,160
Let me tell you what she's been saying.

2213
01:42:30,160 --> 01:42:31,160
She's a Republican,

2214
01:42:31,160 --> 01:42:35,160
but she, I agree with her wholeheartedly.

2215
01:42:35,160 --> 01:42:36,160
She's opposed abortion

2216
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,160
and contraception for teenagers.

2217
01:42:38,160 --> 01:42:41,160
Why are we enabling children

2218
01:42:41,160 --> 01:42:45,160
to take sometimes contraceptives

2219
01:42:45,160 --> 01:42:47,160
that are quite harmful

2220
01:42:47,160 --> 01:42:49,160
or access to abortion?

2221
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:52,160
I think that we really need

2222
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,160
to rethink all of this.

2223
01:42:53,160 --> 01:42:56,160
I think parents need to take back

2224
01:42:56,160 --> 01:42:57,160
control of their children.

2225
01:42:57,160 --> 01:42:58,160
She's called trans people

2226
01:42:58,160 --> 01:43:00,160
fools and perverts.

2227
01:43:00,160 --> 01:43:03,160
Transgenderism is nuts.

2228
01:43:03,160 --> 01:43:05,160
It's for fools and perverts.

2229
01:43:05,160 --> 01:43:07,160
She's denied that transgender

2230
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:09,160
is a legitimate concept.

2231
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:10,160
It's not a real thing.

2232
01:43:10,160 --> 01:43:11,160
There's no such thing

2233
01:43:11,160 --> 01:43:12,160
as being born in the wrong body.

2234
01:43:12,160 --> 01:43:14,160
There's no such thing as a trans woman.

2235
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,160
There's no such thing as a trans person.

2236
01:43:16,160 --> 01:43:17,160
There is no such thing.

2237
01:43:17,160 --> 01:43:19,160
There are people that call themselves

2238
01:43:19,160 --> 01:43:22,160
these things that may have other issues

2239
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:24,160
manifesting that then make them think

2240
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,160
they're this, but no.

2241
01:43:25,160 --> 01:43:27,160
We have to stop using any words

2242
01:43:27,160 --> 01:43:28,160
like transgender.

2243
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:30,160
There may be more words

2244
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,160
that we have to say in order to say that.

2245
01:43:32,160 --> 01:43:34,160
We may call it transgender ideology,

2246
01:43:34,160 --> 01:43:35,160
but when it comes to a person,

2247
01:43:35,160 --> 01:43:38,160
they may be following transgender ideology,

2248
01:43:38,160 --> 01:43:39,160
but they are not transgender.

2249
01:43:39,160 --> 01:43:41,160
There is no such thing as a man

2250
01:43:41,160 --> 01:43:43,160
or a woman being anything other

2251
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:44,160
than a man or a woman.

2252
01:43:44,160 --> 01:43:47,160
She's called trans women pedophiles.

2253
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:49,160
We know that if a man has a paraphilia

2254
01:43:49,160 --> 01:43:51,160
of dressing as a woman,

2255
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:55,160
the most likely cross paraphilia is pedophilia.

2256
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:59,160
We know that these men have multiple paraphilias.

2257
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:01,160
They don't ever stop at one.

2258
01:44:01,160 --> 01:44:03,160
She's said that each and every woman

2259
01:44:03,160 --> 01:44:06,160
who stands in her way will be annihilated.

2260
01:44:06,160 --> 01:44:08,160
Each and every one of you women

2261
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:09,160
who stand in my way,

2262
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,160
each and every one of you,

2263
01:44:11,160 --> 01:44:12,160
let me just tell you,

2264
01:44:12,160 --> 01:44:14,160
you will be annihilated.

2265
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:16,160
She's called on armed men

2266
01:44:16,160 --> 01:44:18,160
to enter women's restrooms

2267
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:20,160
to attack anyone they perceive

2268
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:22,160
as not a real woman.

2269
01:44:22,160 --> 01:44:24,160
And men, for once,

2270
01:44:24,160 --> 01:44:27,160
I'm talking to you.

2271
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:30,160
I'm talking about you dads

2272
01:44:30,160 --> 01:44:32,160
who maybe carry,

2273
01:44:32,160 --> 01:44:34,160
I think that's what you say.

2274
01:44:34,160 --> 01:44:36,160
I'm so done with the American lingo.

2275
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,160
Maybe you carry, maybe you don't.

2276
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:40,160
Maybe you consider yourself

2277
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,160
a protector of women.

2278
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:43,160
Maybe you're that sort of man.

2279
01:44:43,160 --> 01:44:45,160
Maybe you have a daughter

2280
01:44:45,160 --> 01:44:47,160
or a mother or a wife.

2281
01:44:47,160 --> 01:44:48,160
Maybe you have a sister.

2282
01:44:48,160 --> 01:44:49,160
Maybe you just have some friends.

2283
01:44:49,160 --> 01:44:51,160
Maybe you just think women are human

2284
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:52,160
and you don't need

2285
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:55,160
any absolute connection with them

2286
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:58,160
to feel compelled to protect us.

2287
01:44:58,160 --> 01:45:01,160
Um, I think you should start

2288
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:02,160
using women's toilets, men.

2289
01:45:02,160 --> 01:45:04,160
And she's said that women

2290
01:45:04,160 --> 01:45:06,160
who call themselves men

2291
01:45:06,160 --> 01:45:07,160
should be sterilized,

2292
01:45:07,160 --> 01:45:10,160
which seems to be a little bit in tension

2293
01:45:10,160 --> 01:45:12,160
with JK Rowling's concern

2294
01:45:12,160 --> 01:45:15,160
about the fertility of confused girls.

2295
01:45:15,160 --> 01:45:16,160
You know, you might look

2296
01:45:16,160 --> 01:45:18,160
at these differences of opinion

2297
01:45:18,160 --> 01:45:20,160
between Rowling and Parker,

2298
01:45:20,160 --> 01:45:22,160
little things like pro-feminist

2299
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:23,160
versus anti-feminist,

2300
01:45:23,160 --> 01:45:25,160
left versus right,

2301
01:45:25,160 --> 01:45:27,160
pro-abortion versus anti-abortion,

2302
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,160
concern about trans men's fertility

2303
01:45:30,160 --> 01:45:33,160
versus advocating forced sterilization

2304
01:45:33,160 --> 01:45:34,160
of trans men,

2305
01:45:34,160 --> 01:45:36,160
against annihilating women

2306
01:45:36,160 --> 01:45:37,160
who stand in your way

2307
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:40,160
versus pro-annihilating

2308
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:42,160
each and every woman

2309
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:43,160
who stands in your way.

2310
01:45:43,160 --> 01:45:45,160
You might look at these differences

2311
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:46,160
and expect that these two women

2312
01:45:46,160 --> 01:45:47,160
would be at odds.

2313
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:49,160
But they aren't.

2314
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:51,160
Because promoting anti-trans bigotry

2315
01:45:51,160 --> 01:45:52,160
is a common cause

2316
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:54,160
that for both of them,

2317
01:45:54,160 --> 01:45:56,160
trumps all else.

2318
01:45:56,160 --> 01:45:58,160
In 2020, Posey Parker paid for a poster

2319
01:45:58,160 --> 01:45:59,160
reading,

2320
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:01,160
I heart JK Rowling

2321
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:02,160
to be displayed at a railway station

2322
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:03,160
in Edinburgh.

2323
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:05,160
And Rowling has tweeted

2324
01:46:05,160 --> 01:46:07,160
in defense of Parker numerous times

2325
01:46:07,160 --> 01:46:09,160
and has modeled her t-shirts.

2326
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:12,160
So, the gender-critical movement

2327
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:14,160
started by lesbian separatists

2328
01:46:14,160 --> 01:46:16,160
in the 1970s

2329
01:46:16,160 --> 01:46:18,160
has finally passed into the hands

2330
01:46:18,160 --> 01:46:20,160
of pound shop Ava Browns,

2331
01:46:20,160 --> 01:46:22,160
as gender-critical lesbian Julie Bindle

2332
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:24,160
memorably described them.

2333
01:46:24,160 --> 01:46:26,160
It's a movement that has no beliefs

2334
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:28,160
apart from a shared determination

2335
01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:31,160
to reduce the number of trans people.

2336
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:33,160
In the numbers we're currently seeing,

2337
01:46:33,160 --> 01:46:35,160
particularly of young people coming forward,

2338
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:37,160
I find cause for doubt.

2339
01:46:37,160 --> 01:46:39,160
In the meantime,

2340
01:46:39,160 --> 01:46:40,160
while we're trying to get through

2341
01:46:40,160 --> 01:46:41,160
to the decision makers,

2342
01:46:41,160 --> 01:46:43,160
we have to try to limit the harm.

2343
01:46:43,160 --> 01:46:45,160
And that means reducing

2344
01:46:45,160 --> 01:46:47,160
or keeping down the number of people

2345
01:46:47,160 --> 01:46:48,160
who transition.

2346
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:50,160
And that's for two reasons.

2347
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:52,160
One of them is that every one of those people

2348
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,160
is a person who's been damaged.

2349
01:46:54,160 --> 01:46:56,160
But the second one is every one of those people

2350
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:59,160
is basically,

2351
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:02,160
you know, a huge problem to a sane world.

2352
01:47:02,160 --> 01:47:03,160
Like, if you've got people,

2353
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,160
whether they're transitioned,

2354
01:47:04,160 --> 01:47:05,160
whether they're happily transitioned,

2355
01:47:05,160 --> 01:47:07,160
whether they're unhappily transitioned,

2356
01:47:07,160 --> 01:47:08,160
whether they're detransitioned,

2357
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:10,160
if you've got people who've dissociated

2358
01:47:10,160 --> 01:47:12,160
from their sex in some way,

2359
01:47:12,160 --> 01:47:13,160
every one of those people

2360
01:47:13,160 --> 01:47:15,160
is someone who needs special accommodation.

2361
01:47:15,160 --> 01:47:17,160
In a sane world where we

2362
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:19,160
re-acknowledge the truth of sex.

2363
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:21,160
So to wrap this up,

2364
01:47:21,160 --> 01:47:23,160
is the backlash against JK Rowling

2365
01:47:23,160 --> 01:47:25,160
a witch hunt?

2366
01:47:25,160 --> 01:47:27,160
Unequivocally, no.

2367
01:47:27,160 --> 01:47:29,160
It's very thoroughly deserved.

2368
01:47:29,160 --> 01:47:31,160
But I will say this.

2369
01:47:31,160 --> 01:47:33,160
A movement can't get along without a devil.

2370
01:47:33,160 --> 01:47:36,160
And across the whole political spectrum,

2371
01:47:36,160 --> 01:47:38,160
there's a misogynistic tendency

2372
01:47:38,160 --> 01:47:40,160
to choose a female devil.

2373
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:42,160
Whether it's Anita Bryant,

2374
01:47:42,160 --> 01:47:43,160
Hillary Clinton,

2375
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:44,160
Marie Antoinette,

2376
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:47,160
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,

2377
01:47:47,160 --> 01:47:49,160
or JK Rowling.

2378
01:47:49,160 --> 01:47:50,160
And there's always going to be people

2379
01:47:50,160 --> 01:47:52,160
who seize on any opportunity

2380
01:47:52,160 --> 01:47:54,160
to be misogynistic.

2381
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:56,160
So, I would advise trans people

2382
01:47:56,160 --> 01:47:58,160
and our allies to keep in mind

2383
01:47:58,160 --> 01:48:01,160
that JK Rowling is not the final boss

2384
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,160
of transphobia.

2385
01:48:03,160 --> 01:48:05,160
She's not our devil.

2386
01:48:05,160 --> 01:48:07,160
The devil is the Republican Party,

2387
01:48:07,160 --> 01:48:08,160
the conservative party.

2388
01:48:08,160 --> 01:48:10,160
The devil is patriarchy.

2389
01:48:10,160 --> 01:48:12,160
It's the right-wing men

2390
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,160
who will be the ones

2391
01:48:13,160 --> 01:48:15,160
to put gender-critical theory

2392
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:17,160
into brutal practice.

2393
01:48:17,160 --> 01:48:18,160
Anita Bryant,

2394
01:48:18,160 --> 01:48:19,160
Posey Parker,

2395
01:48:19,160 --> 01:48:21,160
and JK Rowling are,

2396
01:48:21,160 --> 01:48:23,160
to borrow a term from TERFs,

2397
01:48:23,160 --> 01:48:24,160
handmaidens.

2398
01:48:24,160 --> 01:48:26,160
TERFs are the real handmaidens.

2399
01:48:26,160 --> 01:48:27,160
They're useful idiots

2400
01:48:27,160 --> 01:48:29,160
who put a concerned female face

2401
01:48:29,160 --> 01:48:31,160
on the patriarchal violence

2402
01:48:31,160 --> 01:48:32,160
against trans people

2403
01:48:32,160 --> 01:48:34,160
that will ultimately be enacted

2404
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:35,160
by right-wing men.

2405
01:48:35,160 --> 01:48:37,160
I call on men

2406
01:48:37,160 --> 01:48:38,160
to consider themselves

2407
01:48:38,160 --> 01:48:40,160
decent human beings.

2408
01:48:40,160 --> 01:48:42,160
To call out the deviance among them

2409
01:48:42,160 --> 01:48:44,160
and eradicate these monsters

2410
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,160
from society.

2411
01:48:46,160 --> 01:48:48,160
And Megan Phillips Roper

2412
01:48:48,160 --> 01:48:49,160
and centrists like her

2413
01:48:49,160 --> 01:48:52,160
are wrong that civil conversation

2414
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:54,160
can resolve this.

2415
01:48:54,160 --> 01:48:56,160
To call out the deviance among them

2416
01:48:56,160 --> 01:48:58,160
and eradicate these monsters

2417
01:48:58,160 --> 01:49:00,160
from society.

2418
01:49:00,160 --> 01:49:02,160
People like Michael Knowles

2419
01:49:02,160 --> 01:49:03,160
and Ron DeSantis

2420
01:49:03,160 --> 01:49:04,160
and Donald Trump

2421
01:49:04,160 --> 01:49:06,160
cannot be persuaded.

2422
01:49:06,160 --> 01:49:08,160
They have to be defeated.

2423
01:49:08,160 --> 01:49:10,160
As for what to do about JK Rowling,

2424
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:11,160
honestly,

2425
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:13,160
let's all just block her.

2426
01:49:13,160 --> 01:49:15,160
Open up Twitter right now,

2427
01:49:15,160 --> 01:49:16,160
go to her profile

2428
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,160
and just block her.

2429
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:18,160
Problem solved.

2430
01:49:18,160 --> 01:49:20,160
Like, don't harass her,

2431
01:49:20,160 --> 01:49:21,160
that doesn't help.

2432
01:49:21,160 --> 01:49:22,160
But also,

2433
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,160
I wouldn't wait for her to change.

2434
01:49:23,160 --> 01:49:25,160
She's gone down what I call

2435
01:49:25,160 --> 01:49:26,160
the bigotry whirlpool.

2436
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:27,160
The deeper you go in,

2437
01:49:27,160 --> 01:49:29,160
the harder it is to leave.

2438
01:49:29,160 --> 01:49:30,160
For the same reasons

2439
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:32,160
that it's hard to quit a cult or scam.

2440
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:34,160
To quote video essayist Dan Olson,

2441
01:49:34,160 --> 01:49:36,160
One of the most insidious elements

2442
01:49:36,160 --> 01:49:37,160
of a confidence scam

2443
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,160
is that the victims

2444
01:49:38,160 --> 01:49:40,160
who invested the most

2445
01:49:40,160 --> 01:49:42,160
are often the most passionate defenders.

2446
01:49:42,160 --> 01:49:43,160
Because shame

2447
01:49:43,160 --> 01:49:44,160
is a powerful force

2448
01:49:44,160 --> 01:49:45,160
in the human psyche

2449
01:49:45,160 --> 01:49:47,160
and they can't bear the shame

2450
01:49:47,160 --> 01:49:49,160
of admitting they were tricked.

2451
01:49:49,160 --> 01:49:50,160
Reformed bigots have to face

2452
01:49:50,160 --> 01:49:51,160
not only the shame

2453
01:49:51,160 --> 01:49:52,160
of being dupes,

2454
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,160
but also the guilt

2455
01:49:53,160 --> 01:49:55,160
of having devoted years of life

2456
01:49:55,160 --> 01:49:57,160
to harming vulnerable people.

2457
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:58,160
This is something Megan,

2458
01:49:58,160 --> 01:49:59,160
to her credit,

2459
01:49:59,160 --> 01:50:00,160
faced head on.

2460
01:50:00,160 --> 01:50:01,160
If we were wrong,

2461
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:02,160
then I had spent

2462
01:50:02,160 --> 01:50:03,160
every day of my life

2463
01:50:03,160 --> 01:50:05,160
industriously sowing doom,

2464
01:50:05,160 --> 01:50:06,160
discord,

2465
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:07,160
and rage

2466
01:50:07,160 --> 01:50:08,160
to so many

2467
01:50:08,160 --> 01:50:09,160
not at the behest of God,

2468
01:50:09,160 --> 01:50:10,160
but of others.

2469
01:50:10,160 --> 01:50:11,160
Not at the behest

2470
01:50:11,160 --> 01:50:12,160
of my grandfather.

2471
01:50:12,160 --> 01:50:13,160
I had wasted my life

2472
01:50:13,160 --> 01:50:14,160
only to fill others

2473
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,160
with pain and misery.

2474
01:50:15,160 --> 01:50:17,160
Most bigots cannot stand

2475
01:50:17,160 --> 01:50:19,160
to face this moral sunk cost.

2476
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:21,160
It's why an obsessive bigot

2477
01:50:21,160 --> 01:50:22,160
like Graham Linehan,

2478
01:50:22,160 --> 01:50:23,160
whose all-consuming hatred

2479
01:50:23,160 --> 01:50:24,160
of trans people

2480
01:50:24,160 --> 01:50:25,160
has ruined his life,

2481
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,160
cost him his marriage,

2482
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:28,160
and left him alone

2483
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:29,160
to tweet about destroying

2484
01:50:29,160 --> 01:50:30,160
gender ideology

2485
01:50:30,160 --> 01:50:31,160
minutes before midnight

2486
01:50:31,160 --> 01:50:32,160
on New Year's Eve,

2487
01:50:32,160 --> 01:50:34,160
feels psychologically compelled

2488
01:50:34,160 --> 01:50:36,160
to insist with ever more certainty

2489
01:50:36,160 --> 01:50:37,160
that trans people

2490
01:50:37,160 --> 01:50:38,160
are not just delusional

2491
01:50:38,160 --> 01:50:39,160
or dangerous,

2492
01:50:39,160 --> 01:50:40,160
but are all

2493
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:42,160
demonic perverts,

2494
01:50:42,160 --> 01:50:44,160
an enemy so hyperbolically evil

2495
01:50:44,160 --> 01:50:45,160
that they justify

2496
01:50:45,160 --> 01:50:47,160
his self-immolating crusade.

2497
01:50:47,160 --> 01:50:50,160
They took everything from me,

2498
01:50:50,160 --> 01:50:51,160
you know.

2499
01:50:51,160 --> 01:50:54,160
They took my family,

2500
01:50:54,160 --> 01:50:55,160
you know.

2501
01:50:55,160 --> 01:50:56,160
And I just said,

2502
01:50:56,160 --> 01:50:57,160
no, hang on a sec.

2503
01:50:57,160 --> 01:50:59,160
Stop calling these women TERFs.

2504
01:50:59,160 --> 01:51:02,160
Stop sending them abuse.

2505
01:51:02,160 --> 01:51:03,160
Let them speak.

2506
01:51:03,160 --> 01:51:05,160
And for that,

2507
01:51:05,160 --> 01:51:07,160
they just destroyed me.

2508
01:51:07,160 --> 01:51:08,160
Do you honestly feel destroyed?

2509
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:10,160
No, because,

2510
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:11,160
because the one thing about this,

2511
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:12,160
the one thing about this

2512
01:51:12,160 --> 01:51:13,160
that keeps me going

2513
01:51:13,160 --> 01:51:15,160
is that I know I'm right,

2514
01:51:15,160 --> 01:51:16,160
you know.

2515
01:51:16,160 --> 01:51:17,160
I know I'm right.

2516
01:51:17,160 --> 01:51:18,160
As long as he stays here,

2517
01:51:18,160 --> 01:51:20,160
in the bottom of the whirlpool,

2518
01:51:20,160 --> 01:51:21,160
he never has to face

2519
01:51:21,160 --> 01:51:23,160
that he's ruined his relationships

2520
01:51:23,160 --> 01:51:24,160
and wasted years of life

2521
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:27,160
because he just couldn't let it go.

2522
01:51:27,160 --> 01:51:28,160
And if JK Rowling

2523
01:51:28,160 --> 01:51:29,160
doesn't log off soon,

2524
01:51:29,160 --> 01:51:32,160
this will likely be her fate as well.

2525
01:51:33,160 --> 01:51:35,160
I guess what I'm really trying to say is,

2526
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:37,160
Harry Potter's dead to me.

2527
01:51:37,160 --> 01:51:39,160
I'm switching to Twilight.

2528
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,160
And there's authors

2529
01:52:09,160 --> 01:52:10,160
that are bound to say

2530
01:52:10,160 --> 01:52:11,160
that wizardry is a good thing

2531
01:52:11,160 --> 01:52:13,160
but neither is warned.

2532
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:14,160
And they say,

2533
01:52:14,160 --> 01:52:15,160
well,

2534
01:52:15,160 --> 01:52:16,160
you and I

2535
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:16,760
can

2536
01:52:16,760 --> 01:52:17,160
think about

2537
01:52:17,160 --> 01:52:18,160
some other story

2538
01:52:18,160 --> 01:52:19,160
you can put a bit

2539
01:52:19,160 --> 01:52:20,160
more perspective.

2540
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:21,540
Anything willка

2541
01:52:23,160 --> 01:52:24,160
please let these characters

2542
01:52:24,160 --> 01:52:25,160
have their own story.

2543
01:52:25,160 --> 01:52:26,160
Because it all depends

2544
01:52:26,160 --> 01:52:27,160
on Jesus.

2545
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:27,720
Especially what one

2546
01:52:27,720 --> 01:52:28,160
of the characters

2547
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,160
would ever say when

2548
01:52:29,160 --> 01:52:30,160
they first come here.

2549
01:52:30,160 --> 01:52:31,160
said that she was

2550
01:52:31,160 --> 01:52:32,160
on the line

2551
01:52:32,160 --> 01:52:33,160
and byr.

2552
01:52:33,160 --> 01:52:34,160
His daughter.

2553
01:52:34,160 --> 01:52:35,160
spelled out

2554
01:52:35,160 --> 01:52:36,160
it's one of the reasons

2555
01:52:36,160 --> 01:52:37,160
Jim Crow doesn't roll over,

2556
01:52:37,160 --> 01:53:07,140
Thank you.

2557
01:53:07,160 --> 01:53:37,140
Thank you.

2558
01:53:37,160 --> 01:54:07,140
Thank you.

2559
01:54:07,160 --> 01:54:37,140
Thank you.

2560
01:54:37,160 --> 01:55:03,180
At least it's a fruit pie.
