1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,240
Bring me another bottle of Moab, told you Antoine. Apparently the world is ending.

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,520
But where is he?

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:20,880
Sometimes I'm so goddamn beautiful it makes me want to throw up. Ugh, I'll get it myself.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Antoine? There you are. Ugh, it's this nerd again.

5
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Hey, Doc. Can you bring me my smelling salts, please?

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'll think about it.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Have you watched my video yet?

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The one about the apocalypse?

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
No, Marie. It's not about the apocalypse. It's about how to stop climate change.

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Well, I can't stand that.

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Well, why don't you watch a few minutes and then I'll bring you your smelling salts.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is extortion. You're singing to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat.

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
My God. You cucks will stop at nothing.

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
That's right. Open wide.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
No.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
No.

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
No.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Welcome to the lab. The lab of aesthetic climatology.

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now?

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Imagine that this is the Earth.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
This is what the Earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
In 1976, a beta cuck named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming.

24
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
about the grave predictions of climate science.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
In particular, the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Gore's activism culminated in 2006 with the release of his documentary An Inconvenient Truth.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,000
But a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park ridiculing Gore

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,000
as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation about a mythological creature called Man-Bear-Pig.

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It is half man, half bear, and half pig.

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic attention-seeking alarmist,

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
an issue-haver, a care-about, a sibilant moral f**k.

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm super serial, you guys.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We all had a good laugh at Gore's foolishness.

35
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,000
After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And in fact, a lot of us probably remember Man-Bear-Pig better than we remember An Inconvenient Truth.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:01,000
A lot of the backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Why Are You So Angry? by Innuendo Studios.

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Part two of the essay describes a phenomenon I'll call the Angry Jack Effect.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It works like this.

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You're at a barbecue shoving brisket into your front hole

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they're vegan.

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
because, even if they're not really judging you,

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
the mere fact that they're a vegan means that they probably have reasons

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
for not eating meat.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
And that means there might be reasons why you shouldn't eat meat.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell them,

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Oh, so you think you're better than me, huh?

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Well, I'll have you know that eating meat is perfectly natural and, um, evolution

51
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
and people who don't eat meat, well, their bones fall out.

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And besides, you're a hypocrite anyway

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
because more animals die when they plow the fields for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation.

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt,

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
from the potential accusation that you're a bad person,

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and you're protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades.

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He's a fun ruiner criticizing our high-emission way of life,

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
and instead of engaging sincerely with the critique,

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
we lash out at him so we don't have to think about it.

62
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real,

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
and Gore was right all along.

64
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
So now it's current year, and the global temperature has risen 1°C above the pre-industrial average,

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
which is on track with the projections presented in Gore's film.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Now, 1°C doesn't sound like much, but to get a sense of scale,

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
consider that the last ice age was only 4.5°C cooler than the 20th century norm.

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
We are already at 1°C warmer than the pre-industrial average,

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:55,000
and current scientific models put us on track for 3°C warmer by the end of the century.

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,000
An outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to 2°C in order to avert global cataclysm.

72
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:14,000
warns that even 2°C of warming could result in an iceless Arctic summer at least once a decade,

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
the destruction of nearly every coral reef,

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
The report therefore recommends that we limit warming to 1.5°C,

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,000
a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years,

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
and net zero emissions by 2050.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But even limiting warming to 2°C requires a significant reduction in emissions.

80
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Otherwise, we're on track for 3°C of warming, and possibly even 4°C or more,

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
a situation that could be near apocalyptic.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Look, Doc, this is just the same liberal media bullshit we've all heard for decades.

83
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Weather changes sometimes.

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You were just talking about the ice age.

85
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
First it was cold, now it's getting warmer.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
That's just nature.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Do you honestly think that all the world's leading climate scientists

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,000
just forgot to take into account that weather changes sometimes?

89
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Isn't it obvious to you that this whole guilt trip about carbon emissions

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
is just an attack on the American way of life,

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
another excuse for big government to take away my freedom?

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
What freedom? Are you an oil company?

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company?

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Isn't that what you liberals think?

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
My identity is valid.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
No, it isn't.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Bring me my smelling salts.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Watch the goddamn video.

99
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Imagine the year is 2100.

100
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I want you to picture the Earth as a human vagina,

101
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
and imagine you're a gynecologist,

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and you're using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon.

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How does that make you feel, kids?

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I bet you wish your irresponsible, gas-guzzling parents had done something to stop this.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
So, we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching,

106
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but at least our political leaders are responsible, rational, and scientifically literate, right?

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Is there climate change yet?

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Will it go back like this?

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I mean, will it change back?

110
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Probably, that's what I think.

111
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I believe it goes this way.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial,

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax

114
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
aimed at undermining American manufacturing,

115
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to his tweet last week that it's very cold outside,

116
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
therefore, whatever happened to global warming?

117
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Of course, the term global warming refers to

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
the increase in the global average temperature,

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
temperature continuing to vary by region.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder,

121
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
for instance, if the ocean current known as the Atlantic Conveyor Belt is disrupted,

122
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
But Trump doesn't know or care about any of that.

124
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He's kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know?

125
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
A real man, who takes what he wants by any means necessary,

126
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and won't be slowed down by any worries about what's factual,

127
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
or scientific, or true, or good,

128
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
or consensual, or just, or safe, or legal, or even possible.

129
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
He's the kind of man who Americans collectively want,

130
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
on some sub-rational, erotic level,

131
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god emperor.

132
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Burn the scholars! Build the wall!

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But the problem, at least for those of you who don't actively enjoy

134
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
civilization's plunge into primeval darkness,

135
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
is that the notion that there's any actual scientific controversy

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false.

137
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change

138
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
found that 97% of papers published on the subject

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming,

140
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
and the consensus has only increased over time.

141
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe,

142
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
but is very common in America,

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:38,000
largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that goes back to the early 1990s,

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
when the Western Fuels Association developed a strategy to

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
quote,

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
They positioned global warming as theory, not fact,

148
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way

149
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
to promote that message via a propaganda campaign.

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Climate denialist talking points, promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades,

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,000
have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family,

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians,

153
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
perhaps most vocally, Senator James Inhofe,

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies,

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and who's presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments

156
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
as throwing a snowball to own the libs.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Denialist talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins,

159
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
where they provide ammunition for the angry jack effect.

160
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Just like Al Gore, or any messenger of inconvenient information,

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph,

163
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
has received thousands of hate messages, death threats,

164
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
even white powder in the mail.

165
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering

166
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation,

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future.

168
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It's likely that this video will attract some deniers,

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
there's still scientific controversy about the cause of climate change,

172
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
there isn't, what if the sun is getting hotter,

173
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
it's not, at least in the relevant timeframe,

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and science is a liar sometimes.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But even if you don't believe in science,

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
maybe you'll find it convincing that even many oil companies,

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
and caused by human activity.

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
In fact, at the behest of oil companies,

180
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds

181
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast,

182
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides

183
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
and more severe tropical storms.

184
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to quote,

186
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
future-proof the state,

187
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
despite the fact that many of its top politicians

188
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
are public climate change deniers.

189
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You remember how it used to be called global warming?

190
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
And then magically the theory changed to climate change?

191
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sure.

192
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
The reason is it wasn't warming.

193
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids.

194
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
The science is clear.

195
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Climate change is real and humans are causing it.

196
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If even ExxonMobil says it's real,

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
it's probably real.

198
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There's really no point in digging in your heels

199
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
and refusing to look at the evidence

200
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
just because you don't want it to be true.

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
None of us want it to be true.

202
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Okay, fine.

203
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer.

204
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
And maybe humans have something to do with it.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Now can you give me my smelling salts?

206
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Fine.

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Look, Doc, I gotta say,

208
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
maybe the scientists are right.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Maybe it is happening.

210
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
But to be honest with you,

211
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm having a hard time caring about this.

212
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Like, at all.

213
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
How can you not care about this?

214
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
We're talking about the future of the planet.

215
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, I don't care about the planet.

216
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I care about me.

217
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Well, don't you live on the planet?

218
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Mm-hmm.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
And don't you care what happens to the planet you live on?

220
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
No.

221
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
God damn it.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Watch the video.

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
If you picture the Earth as a watermelon,

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
you can see there's the outer shell here

225
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
that traps the red flesh.

226
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
And if you leave it out at midnight,

227
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
the stalkers...

228
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
The stalkers come for the red flesh.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Before describing the details of our doom,

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
let's take a moment to review how we got where we are.

231
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
The modern science of anthropogenic climate change

232
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
began in 1896,

233
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arrhenius

234
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
published a study titled

235
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Upon the Temperature of the Earth,

237
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
would eventually have a warming effect on the planet.

239
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
By 1960, scientists had demonstrated

240
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere

241
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
was in fact rising,

242
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
and President Buckin-Johnson's science advisory

243
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
committee warned that industrial CO2 emissions

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
could have a greenhouse warming effect.

245
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The Stanford Research Institute warned

246
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
the American Petroleum Institute in 1968

247
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and rising sea levels.

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But nothing was really done about it until 1988,

250
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
when NASA announced to the US Senate

251
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history,

252
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
that the warming could be attributed to human causes

253
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
with 99% certainty,

254
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
and that the warming was worsening heat waves,

255
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
storms, and droughts.

256
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
That same year, the IPCC was formed

257
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
to provide world leaders with a summary

258
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
of the science on climate change

259
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
and its political and economic impacts.

260
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
So it started to seem like something was going to change.

261
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But by the early 1990s,

262
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
was up and running in the United States,

264
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
despite the fact that oil companies

265
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
had known climate change was happening for decades,

266
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
and Republican politicians became mouthpieces

267
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
for the so-called skeptic cause.

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration

269
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
signed the Kyoto Protocol,

270
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
pledging the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

271
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on.

272
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
The 2012 Republican platform stated,

273
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
against all scientific consensus, that

274
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
quote,

275
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Then, finally, in 2015,

276
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
things seemed to be changing for the better.

277
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
195 nations, including China, India,

278
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
and the United States under Obama,

279
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
became parties to the Paris Agreement,

280
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
which established the goal of limiting

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
the increase in global temperature

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

283
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
By the very next year, Donald Trump

284
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
was elected President of the United States

285
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
on a platform of outright climate science denial.

286
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Trump has since begun withdrawing

287
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
the United States from the Paris Agreement,

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
appointed a climate change denier

289
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,

290
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and released his America First Energy Plan,

291
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels.

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
So it's with a particular sense of doom

293
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
that we now receive the grim 2018 Iron Curtain.

294
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
The world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius,

295
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps,

296
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
increased average temperatures,

297
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
increased extreme weather events,

298
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
and increased mosquito-borne illnesses

299
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
like malaria, dengue, and Zika.

300
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If drastic action is taken

301
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030,

302
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
and to net-zero carbon by 2050,

303
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
global warming will still increase

304
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,

305
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
resulting in a doubling of populations

306
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
exposed to water and air pollution.

307
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
The global warming will increase

308
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,

309
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
reducing water scarcity and drought,

310
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
and an estimated $10 trillion

311
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
in annual flood damage losses from sea-level rise.

312
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
But with the current political situation,

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees

314
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
is quickly slipping out of reach.

315
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
By the end of this century,

316
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
we're likely to see at least 2 degrees of warming,

317
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
which will lead to the eventual displacement

318
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
of 200 million people in coastal regions.

319
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
3 degrees of warming will flood

320
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
many of the world's major coastal cities,

321
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
including Shanghai, Miami,

322
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Osaka, Rio de Janeiro,

323
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Alexandria, and Hong Kong.

324
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
4 degrees of warming will be close to the difference

325
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
between early 20th century temperatures

326
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
and the last ice age.

327
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees

328
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
from island and coastal areas

329
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
will be exacerbated by severe droughts

330
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
and water scarcity,

331
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
trillions of dollars of damage to the economy,

332
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
famines, starvation, terrorism, and war.

333
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
So it's not just the poor polar bears

334
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
and coral reefs.

335
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
There are real human consequences to this.

336
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
See? This is why you should care.

337
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's not just about the planet,

338
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
it's about the millions of people who are going to die,

339
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
and their homes.

340
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Oh, jeez, wow.

341
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Gosh, that's really just too bad.

342
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
What kind of response is that?

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Look, Doc,

344
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
people die all the time.

345
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
What am I supposed to do, cry about it?

346
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
No, you're supposed to take political action.

347
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Yeah, I guess I

348
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
could do

349
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
that, but

350
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
this bath is

351
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
very relaxing.

352
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Well, look, even if you only care

353
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
about yourself, you do realize that

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
when the coastal cities flood,

355
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
we're going to have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right?

356
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Are you going to be okay with that?

357
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
No.

358
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Well, then you'd better do something to reduce carbon emissions.

359
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
No!

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Well, then you'd better be ready to take in a lot of refugees.

361
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
No!

362
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
You do realize, right, that in a hundred years,

363
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
everyone is going to look back on people like you,

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
and they're going to hate you so much

365
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
for what you allowed to happen to this planet.

366
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Well, those are future people.

367
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I am alive now.

368
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
And besides, if what you're saying is true,

369
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
it's the apocalypse anyway, so why not just

370
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
party and enjoy ourselves, right?

371
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
But it's not the apocalypse, though.

372
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form

373
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
of denialism, because we still have

374
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
a little bit of time to fix the problem.

375
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Please, God, please,

376
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
just try to focus on solving the problem

377
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
while we still have time.

378
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
So, you're saying the world is ending. Cheers to that.

379
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
The world is not ending.

380
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
It's just getting shittier.

381
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

382
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

383
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Alright, let me just re-up here.

384
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
.

385
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
.

386
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
.

387
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
.

388
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
.

389
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
.

390
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
.

391
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
.

392
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
.

393
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
.

394
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
.

395
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
.

396
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
.

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
.

398
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
.

399
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
.

400
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
.

401
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
.

402
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
.

403
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
.

404
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
.

405
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
.

406
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
.

407
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
.

408
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
.

409
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
.

410
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
.

411
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

412
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

413
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,460
If you want to do your part to stop climate change,

414
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,660
there are some lifestyle changes you can make.

415
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,380
You can use LED light bulbs,

416
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,680
you can drive a hybrid or electric car,

417
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,500
you can use public transportation,

418
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,500
you can try not to fly very often,

419
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,800
you can eat less red meat.

420
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,340
But the reality is, just 100 companies

421
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,680
are responsible for 71% of global emissions,

422
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,140
and the burden of stopping this

423
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:27,780
can't really be placed on individual consumers.

424
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:30,100
The companies themselves do not care.

425
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,200
Left to their own devices,

426
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,180
they will only pursue short-term profit.

427
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,440
They will ask the government to build them sea walls

428
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,660
while continuing to emit greenhouse gases.

429
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,200
Climate change is exactly the kind of problem

430
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,340
that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve.

431
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,100
The timeframe involved is short enough

432
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,720
that scientists can predict total catastrophe

433
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,160
in the foreseeable future,

434
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,560
but just long enough not to enter into

435
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,560
the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations.

436
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,320
So unless there's a drastic change

437
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,740
in the next couple decades,

438
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:01,180
this is going to be capitalism's great Chinese famine moment,

439
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,160
only potentially, it'll be much, much worse.

440
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,660
This is probably the most important issue

441
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,780
facing humanity in the 21st century,

442
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:10,640
so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary,

443
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,920
beginning with rapid political change.

444
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,700
If that means direct action, it means direct action.

445
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:18,020
For instance, organizing, participating in,

446
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,320
or supporting a massive general strike.

447
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,360
You also should demand that your politicians

448
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,700
take a strong stance against climate change

449
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,300
and the companies that cause it.

450
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,880
And if you're American, vote this monumental ding-dong

451
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,120
out of the Oval Office in 2020 before the entire planet

452
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,280
shrinks and transforms into a corn cob.

453
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,620
So let me get this straight.

454
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,980
You want me to go vegan, drive a Prius, and vote Democrat.

455
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:46,980
You're basically asking me to completely change

456
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,680
who I am as a person and become everything I hate.

457
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,240
Yeah, pretty much.

458
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,980
But it's not about what I want.

459
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:55,000
It's about what everyone has to do

460
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,120
to preserve the survival of humanity.

461
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,120
Well, electric cars, veganism.

462
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,560
Who can even afford that shit?

463
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,060
Well, you can't afford it if you drink less champagne.

464
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,860
I shall do no such thing.

465
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,440
Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco.

466
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:13,380
I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater.

467
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,180
You know, eating plant-based meals

468
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,180
actually costs less than eating meat.

469
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:22,180
Oh, okay, so just never again enjoy the morning aroma

470
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:26,400
of bacon sizzling on the skillet, barbecued ribs,

471
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,400
fried chicken, corn dogs, spicy pork belly, lamb chops,

472
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,040
bloody steaks.

473
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Oh, okay, so just never again enjoy the morning aroma of bacon sizzling on the skillet, barbecued ribs, fried chicken, corn dogs, spicy pork belly, lamb chops, bloody steaks.

474
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,000
Mmm.

475
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,040
Ew, why do you wanna eat all that murdered animal flesh anyway

476
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,980
when you could eat pure, clean, and natural foods

477
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:42,880
like lentils, barley, and sprouts?

478
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,000
No, no, no, no, no.

479
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,580
I'd rather eat human shit.

480
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,760
Well, that's what you're gonna be eating

481
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,620
if the planet heats another few degrees.

482
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,980
How am I supposed to care about rising sea levels

483
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,720
when there's Muslims out there?

484
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,840
And Mexicans?

485
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,020
There could be Muslim Mexicans, for all I know.

486
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:00,800
Why is racist paranoia so compelling to you

487
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,120
when all the climate science in the world just bounces

488
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,840
that thick skull of yours so first of all you people think everything is racist and second

489
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:14,880
i guess i just need a villain you know who's the bad guy who am i afraid of what's the other team

490
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,720
your climate story has no antagonist is that really what it's gonna take

491
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:26,000
all right then why don't you take a long hard look out at the sea that's right there she is

492
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,160
now look right over there

493
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:39,200
hello mankind it is i your dark mother the sea and you my children have been an absolute
