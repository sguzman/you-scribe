00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
I

00:30.000 --> 00:41.340
In 1989, a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically

00:41.340 --> 00:46.520
incorrect theory claiming that trans women are not, as custom has it, essentially female

00:46.520 --> 00:48.780
souls accidentally born into male bodies.

00:49.000 --> 00:54.680
Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types, gay men who love straight men, and straight

00:54.680 --> 00:56.020
men who love themselves.

00:56.020 --> 00:59.720
For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term autogynephilia.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.580
New Greek for love of oneself as a woman.

01:02.940 --> 01:06.980
It's a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves,

01:07.200 --> 01:11.160
and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which,

01:11.460 --> 01:14.840
okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard said.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.180
One, just what the hell do I think I'm doing?

01:36.300 --> 01:40.740
Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard's theory is false, but

01:40.740 --> 01:45.340
a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I'm using my platform to potentially

01:45.340 --> 01:50.260
increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already

01:50.260 --> 01:50.700
face.

01:50.700 --> 01:55.940
After all, autogynephilia gives scientific legitimacy to our culture's most twisted

01:55.940 --> 01:57.680
misrepresentations of trans women.

01:57.680 --> 01:58.940
Who do you fuck with?

02:00.000 --> 02:05.360
So it's understandable that to a lot of trans women, the prospect of this concept

02:05.360 --> 02:08.060
gaining cultural traction is pretty terrifying.

02:08.060 --> 02:13.200
However, I respond that, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transsexuals, I've had several

02:13.200 --> 02:17.120
conversations with academics and journalists where it becomes clear that they believe in

02:17.120 --> 02:20.480
Blanchard's theory, even if the cowards won't admit it to my face.

02:20.480 --> 02:25.240
So as I see it, the damage is already done, what's needed now is an accessible, convincing

02:25.240 --> 02:26.680
refutation of the theory.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.940
I hope this video will accomplish three things.

02:28.940 --> 02:29.940
1.

02:29.940 --> 02:32.660
Persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong.

02:32.660 --> 02:33.660
2.

02:33.660 --> 02:35.660
Account for how a wrong theory became so influential.

02:35.660 --> 02:36.660
3.

02:36.660 --> 02:41.260
Move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people and open up a deeper discussion about

02:41.260 --> 02:43.680
what it really means to be transgender.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.020
Socrates?

02:45.020 --> 02:47.020
You know the drill.

02:47.020 --> 02:48.980
2.

02:48.980 --> 02:50.440
Blanchard's Typology

02:50.440 --> 02:54.620
The mainstream scientific view, endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender

02:54.620 --> 02:59.780
Health, the DSM-5, and most practicing clinicians, is that the primary reason trans people trans

02:59.780 --> 03:02.800
transition is to alleviate gender dysphoria.

03:02.800 --> 03:08.820
Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual, and sartorial

03:08.820 --> 03:13.400
angst relating to one's assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and medically

03:13.400 --> 03:16.600
transitioning to the gender of one's psychological identity.

03:16.600 --> 03:20.820
This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view.

03:20.820 --> 03:24.500
However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory.

03:24.500 --> 03:28.500
According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations.

03:28.500 --> 03:33.240
He didn't really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all

03:33.240 --> 03:34.420
are excused.

03:34.420 --> 03:37.060
You can just grab a beer and laugh it up.

03:37.060 --> 03:43.100
Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of men, and yeah, I know, just

03:43.100 --> 03:44.740
hold your objections for the end.

03:44.740 --> 03:47.320
The first type are the homosexual transsexuals.

03:47.320 --> 03:51.120
These gay boys cannot get enough dick, and who can blame them?

03:51.120 --> 03:56.020
Essentially, the homosexual transsexuals are naturally effeminate gay men who transition

03:56.020 --> 03:57.020
because 1.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.020
1.

03:58.020 --> 04:01.500
They're more disgusting of them as women than as very effeminate men, and 2.

04:01.500 --> 04:05.240
Becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them since they do better as women in the

04:05.240 --> 04:10.140
heterosexual dating market than as male femmes in the mask-for-mask dominated gay scene.

04:10.140 --> 04:14.000
The second type of trans women are the autogynephilic transsexuals.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.300
These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror.

04:19.300 --> 04:24.440
Blanchard describes autogynephiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.940
It doesn't really matter, because their primary sexual orientation is asexuality.

04:27.940 --> 04:32.780
It's misdirected inward, leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming

04:32.780 --> 04:35.180
women, which is their true motivation to transition.

04:35.180 --> 04:38.960
Now I'm going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge

04:38.960 --> 04:43.660
that there does seem to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend

04:43.660 --> 04:46.620
to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits.

04:46.620 --> 04:51.700
I'll replace the stigmatizing terms homosexual transsexual and autogynephile with more neutral

04:51.700 --> 04:57.280
language, let's say cluster A and cluster B. Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic,

04:57.940 --> 04:58.940
attracted to men.

04:58.940 --> 05:03.040
They transition relatively early in life and are very effeminate as children.

05:03.040 --> 05:07.400
Cluster B trans women are mostly gynephilic, attracted to women, transition relatively

05:07.400 --> 05:10.820
later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods.

05:10.820 --> 05:14.320
When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid.

05:14.320 --> 05:18.440
I went through the mental list of trans women I know, and found I could pretty easily sort

05:18.440 --> 05:19.440
them.

05:19.440 --> 05:23.180
Cluster A, cluster A, cluster B, cluster B. But as I've thought about it more, it's

05:23.180 --> 05:24.180
partially unraveled.

05:24.180 --> 05:27.940
Without even leaving my circle of acquaintances, I can think of a trans woman who falls into

05:27.940 --> 05:28.940
one of two clusters.

05:28.940 --> 05:31.320
A trans woman who followed all the cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans

05:31.320 --> 05:35.200
woman who followed all the cluster B patterns but now exclusively dates men.

05:35.200 --> 05:40.000
So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here, I interpret them merely as correlation

05:40.000 --> 05:42.260
clusters that get fuzzy around the edges.

05:42.260 --> 05:47.300
Blanchard, however, takes homosexual transsexuals and autogynephiles to be two sharply distinct

05:47.300 --> 05:51.760
types, with two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition.

05:51.760 --> 05:56.620
And this is what I strongly disagree with, the notion that male homosexuals' strategy,

05:56.620 --> 05:57.940
or autogynephilic lust, is the same.

05:57.940 --> 06:01.760
Transsexuals are the primary motivations to transition, and I have a lot of backup

06:01.760 --> 06:06.740
here since trans women almost universally reject this characterization of their experience.

06:06.740 --> 06:10.620
Now you'd think that'd be a major problem for the theory, but fortunately Blanchard

06:10.620 --> 06:15.820
has an airtight response to that, namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking

06:15.820 --> 06:16.820
liars.

06:16.820 --> 06:19.040
I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it?

06:19.040 --> 06:21.500
A theory that can't be falsified.

06:21.500 --> 06:23.500
It's perfect.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.500
3.

06:25.500 --> 06:26.700
The Man Who Would Be Queen

06:26.700 --> 06:27.700
3.

06:27.700 --> 06:28.700
The Man Who Would Be Queen

06:28.700 --> 06:31.220
Blanchard's theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of sexologists before

06:31.220 --> 06:35.680
fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications had it not been given

06:35.680 --> 06:41.140
a major publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed

06:41.140 --> 06:46.380
Blanchard's theory in a 2003 pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen.

06:46.380 --> 06:47.840
Great cover, Bailey.

06:47.840 --> 06:51.540
Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect.

06:51.540 --> 06:52.940
I have been triggered.

06:52.940 --> 06:53.940
Well done.

06:53.940 --> 06:55.580
Now Bailey, I read your book, which, considering how much I enjoy your cream, is a very controversial,

06:55.580 --> 06:56.580
very provocative, very politically incorrect, I have been triggered.

06:56.580 --> 06:57.580
Well done.

06:57.700 --> 06:59.500
The Man Who Would Be Queen was just amazingly bad.

06:59.500 --> 07:03.360
The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women because it's acutely

07:03.360 --> 07:07.860
transphobic but also kind of vivid and well written, and it introduced a wide audience

07:07.860 --> 07:09.400
to Blanchard's typology.

07:09.400 --> 07:13.620
The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals, including Bailey's and his

07:13.620 --> 07:18.540
male research assistant's observations that they're super fuckable and natural-born sex

07:18.540 --> 07:19.540
workers.

07:19.540 --> 07:24.380
I start upstairs to get the panoramic view and I see Kim for the first time on the stairs

07:24.380 --> 07:25.380
dancing, posing.

07:25.380 --> 07:26.380
She is spectacular.

07:26.380 --> 07:27.380
She is spectacular.

07:27.700 --> 07:28.700
She is spectacular.

07:28.700 --> 07:29.700
Exotic.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.700
I find out later that she is from Belize.

07:32.700 --> 07:34.660
And sexy.

07:34.660 --> 07:40.200
Her body is incredibly curvaceous, which is a clue that it may not be natural.

07:40.200 --> 07:47.720
And I notice a very subtle and not unattractive angularity of the face, which is also not clearly

07:47.720 --> 07:51.060
diagnostic on this tall siren.

07:51.060 --> 07:56.140
It is difficult to avoid viewing Kim from two perspectives.

07:56.140 --> 07:57.140
As a researcher.

07:57.140 --> 08:02.140
But also as a single heterosexual man.

08:02.140 --> 08:04.700
Wow Bailey, great science writing.

08:04.700 --> 08:09.140
When he's done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals, Bailey moves on to the autogynephilic

08:09.140 --> 08:14.140
transsexuals, focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls

08:14.140 --> 08:19.140
Cher, whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of autoerotic mania and transvestic

08:19.140 --> 08:20.140
masturbation.

08:20.140 --> 08:25.140
Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prostheses,

08:25.140 --> 08:26.140
while receiving anal sex from a sex worker.

08:26.140 --> 08:27.140
Bailey says she has been able to get her anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction,

08:27.140 --> 08:28.140
all to the accompaniment of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.140
It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke.

08:29.140 --> 08:30.140
So well done Bailey, you've found an honest-to-god pervert.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.140
And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.140
I admire it, I want it in my life.

08:32.140 --> 08:33.140
But as a transsexual, I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.

08:33.140 --> 08:34.140
You just found a person who built a sex robot.

08:34.140 --> 08:35.140
That's not helpful.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.140
I'm sorry.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.140
I'm sorry.

08:37.140 --> 08:38.140
I'm sorry.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.140
I'm sorry.

08:39.140 --> 08:40.140
I'm sorry.

08:40.140 --> 08:41.140
I'm sorry.

08:41.140 --> 08:42.140
I'm sorry.

08:42.140 --> 08:43.140
I'm sorry.

08:43.140 --> 08:44.140
I'm sorry.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.140
I'm sorry.

08:45.140 --> 08:46.140
I'm sorry.

08:46.140 --> 08:47.140
I'm sorry.

08:47.140 --> 08:50.240
I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.

08:50.240 --> 08:55.740
You just found a- You just found a person who built a sex robot!

08:55.740 --> 08:57.560
That's not how Bailey sees it, though.

08:57.560 --> 09:02.080
He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autogynephiliac transsexual, claiming that

09:02.080 --> 09:06.600
Cher's sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women who aren't

09:06.600 --> 09:08.420
exclusively attracted to men.

09:08.420 --> 09:13.060
So Bailey's telling is that autogynephiles are these unfeminine male masturbators showing

09:13.060 --> 09:16.080
up to gender clinics with bogus stories of how they always knew they

09:16.080 --> 09:20.320
women in order to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia.

09:20.320 --> 09:24.240
Now what's striking about this to me is even for a defense of Blanchard's theory,

09:24.240 --> 09:27.440
Bailey's account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be.

09:27.440 --> 09:31.280
Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher,

09:31.280 --> 09:33.680
pursuing the light of truth wherever it may lead,

09:33.680 --> 09:37.120
unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness alike.

09:37.120 --> 09:38.960
You're so filthy.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.840
But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like?

09:41.840 --> 09:44.640
What objective methodologies does Bailey employ?

09:44.640 --> 09:48.560
Well, for the most part, it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago

09:48.560 --> 09:52.480
and chats up trans women, turning these stories into case studies for his book.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.520
Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research.

09:55.520 --> 09:57.360
You need a research assistant, Bailey?

09:57.360 --> 10:00.240
The Man Who Would Be Queen is filled with sentences like,

10:00.240 --> 10:07.760
There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer, so I'll just go ahead.

10:08.320 --> 10:10.480
All right, you edgy fuck, let's hear it.

10:11.120 --> 10:14.400
Most homosexual transsexuals are

10:14.400 --> 10:14.640
most

10:14.640 --> 10:18.960
much better looking than most autogynephilic transsexuals.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.240
We appreciate the feedback, Bailey, we really do.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.760
But is this science?

10:23.760 --> 10:26.960
It's effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery

10:26.960 --> 10:30.000
that young straight chicks are hotter than middle-aged lesbians

10:30.000 --> 10:33.040
and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation.

10:33.040 --> 10:36.560
And like the pop science cishet men have written over the past century

10:36.560 --> 10:39.360
regarding the nature of females and homosexuals,

10:39.360 --> 10:43.920
their observations about trans women are seriously lacking some vital perspectives.

10:43.920 --> 10:44.400
This is what

10:44.400 --> 10:48.960
we postmodernists mean when we complain that science often privileges a white,

10:48.960 --> 10:50.640
cishet male perspective.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.360
It's not that I hate men or male sexuality,

10:53.360 --> 10:58.800
I just hate that the male sexual perspective is so powerful that it gets to call itself science.

10:58.800 --> 11:00.800
It's not that there is no objective truth,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.920
it's that this represents a very narrow window on it.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.480
Wouldn't anyone care to hear a different perspective?

11:06.480 --> 11:07.920
Well, how about mine?

11:10.560 --> 11:11.360
Four.

11:11.360 --> 11:12.560
My perspective.

11:12.560 --> 11:14.240
From my perspective, Michael,

11:14.240 --> 11:16.320
Bailey is a lecherous edgelord.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.960
He's a man who, when I was a student at Northwestern,

11:18.960 --> 11:21.760
was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident.

11:21.760 --> 11:22.560
Google it.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.080
Of course, that doesn't mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren't true.

11:26.080 --> 11:29.360
Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard

11:29.360 --> 11:31.920
to sacrifice a trans baby to Beelzebub,

11:31.920 --> 11:35.840
it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctness of the theory,

11:35.840 --> 11:37.280
which might still be true.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.360
The problem is, it isn't true,

11:39.360 --> 11:41.120
which I'll argue at length in a moment.

11:41.120 --> 11:44.080
But first, it's worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance,

11:44.080 --> 11:46.960
among a non-trivial number of academics and journalists.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.400
Largely because, one,

11:48.400 --> 11:51.840
it's often presented as the only supposedly scientific alternative

11:51.840 --> 11:54.720
to mushy platitudes about women born in men's bodies,

11:54.720 --> 11:55.440
and two,

11:55.440 --> 11:58.080
many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard

11:58.080 --> 12:00.400
with extreme vitriol and personal attacks,

12:00.400 --> 12:04.160
resulting in the widespread perception that a bunch of triggered PC cucks

12:04.160 --> 12:07.280
are throwing a narcissistic male-entitlement temper tantrum

12:07.280 --> 12:11.360
because Bailey and Blanchard accurately call them out as paraphilic fetishists.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.840
In her 2015 book, Galileo's Middle Finger,

12:13.840 --> 12:17.440
bioethicist Alice Drager championed Bailey as the undeserving victim

12:17.440 --> 12:19.760
of a hysterical SJW lynch mob.

12:19.760 --> 12:22.080
But she gets so caught up in exonerating Bailey

12:22.080 --> 12:24.000
of the personal accusations against him,

12:24.000 --> 12:26.560
and in telling a bigger story about academic freedom

12:26.560 --> 12:29.280
and how scientists are being silenced by PC cucks,

12:29.280 --> 12:32.800
that she doesn't bother to check how good Bailey's science really is,

12:32.800 --> 12:35.840
and ends up affirming the autogynephilia theory herself.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.640
Now I'm certainly not gonna deny that trans people on the internet

12:38.640 --> 12:41.440
can sometimes behave like a bit of an angry mob.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.200
In fact, I may be on the receiving end

12:43.200 --> 12:45.920
of one of those myself in about, oh, 20 minutes,

12:45.920 --> 12:47.840
depending on how this video is received.

12:47.840 --> 12:50.960
But there's not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression

12:50.960 --> 12:52.960
from the Blanchard and Bailey camp either.

12:52.960 --> 12:57.200
Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors,

12:57.200 --> 13:00.160
and Drager is an advocate for the narcissistic rage theory

13:00.160 --> 13:02.080
of trans backlash against Bailey.

13:02.080 --> 13:04.640
Remember, according to autogynephilia theory,

13:04.640 --> 13:07.520
many trans women are erotically fixated on themselves,

13:07.520 --> 13:10.320
from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap

13:10.320 --> 13:12.160
to saying that they're narcissists,

13:12.160 --> 13:12.640
and hence,

13:12.640 --> 13:15.360
any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation

13:15.360 --> 13:20.000
is accused of exhibiting narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego.

13:20.000 --> 13:24.160
Furthermore, like so many other professors in recent academic freedom controversies,

13:24.160 --> 13:28.000
Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly silenced by PC cucks

13:28.000 --> 13:31.040
has not really interfered with their academic careers,

13:31.040 --> 13:34.800
nor their continued authority to misrepresent people with less power than them.

13:34.800 --> 13:39.680
This is of course assuming that autogynephilia really is a misrepresentation of trans women,

13:39.680 --> 13:42.400
and that's really the crux of this whole drama, isn't it?

13:42.400 --> 13:46.000
So let's just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.760
pursuing the pure light of truth,

13:47.760 --> 13:49.440
as we always do on this channel,

13:49.440 --> 13:50.800
relying only on the facts,

13:50.800 --> 13:51.520
the figures,

13:51.520 --> 13:52.960
the scientific studies.

13:52.960 --> 13:53.760
Just kidding.

13:53.760 --> 13:57.120
If you really want to read a scientific argument against autogynephilia,

13:57.120 --> 13:58.880
read Julia Serrano's article,

13:58.880 --> 14:00.640
The Case Against Autogynephilia,

14:00.640 --> 14:02.160
which pretty much sums it up.

14:02.160 --> 14:06.320
Because I know that you didn't click on this video because you wanted to hear about science,

14:06.320 --> 14:08.400
you came here because you wanted filth,

14:08.400 --> 14:10.080
and I'll give you filth, Bailey.

14:10.080 --> 14:11.680
I know that's what you want,

14:11.680 --> 14:13.680
and I wanna give you what you want.

14:13.680 --> 14:15.280
I wanna give it all up for you.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.160
5. The False Dichotomy

14:22.160 --> 14:24.080
Filth is coming, don't worry,

14:24.080 --> 14:27.200
but before we get there there's one more thing we need to discuss.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.640
Advocates of Blanchard's theory pretty much unanimously introduce it

14:30.640 --> 14:33.600
as if it were the only possible alternative to what's called

14:33.600 --> 14:35.520
The Feminine Essence Theory.

14:35.520 --> 14:40.000
The Feminine Essence Theory says that trans women are female souls and male bodies,

14:40.000 --> 14:41.680
that we are women from birth to death,

14:41.680 --> 14:46.020
path, and that transition is merely an effort to make our accidental exterior match our

14:46.020 --> 14:47.600
essential interior.

14:47.600 --> 14:54.000
People like Draeger will tell you that TRANSACTIVISTS dogmatically adhere to this theory, and that

14:54.000 --> 14:57.440
anyone who challenges it will be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt.

14:57.440 --> 15:01.480
And of course, the only way to challenge it, we're told, is to defer to Blanchard's

15:01.480 --> 15:05.240
typology of homosexual and autogynephilic transsexuals.

15:05.240 --> 15:09.440
Now I object to this framing of the discussion, because I don't believe in Blanchard's

15:09.440 --> 15:12.060
typology or the feminine essence theory.

15:12.060 --> 15:15.320
There is no feminine singularity that made me a woman from birth.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.160
I wasn't born a woman.

15:17.160 --> 15:21.240
I was born a fucking baby, just like everyone else.

15:21.240 --> 15:24.780
There's no such thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence.

15:24.780 --> 15:29.640
There's only biology, habitual behavior, and the way society responds to you, all of which

15:29.640 --> 15:33.620
can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are currently changing for me.

15:33.620 --> 15:36.660
Now there is an emotional appeal to the feminine essence theory.

15:36.660 --> 15:39.440
I think most people have gender essentialist intuition.

15:39.440 --> 15:45.060
And I admit I do feel, on some level, that I'm supposed to be a woman by nature.

15:45.060 --> 15:46.900
And in a sense that may be true.

15:46.900 --> 15:50.940
I don't think I chose to be trans, and it seems likely that there's something inherent

15:50.940 --> 15:54.520
in my biology or psychology that led me to transition.

15:54.520 --> 15:59.000
But that's not quite the same thing as essential womanhood, which intellectually I don't

15:59.000 --> 16:00.180
think makes sense.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.080
I think it's heartwarming gibberish.

16:02.080 --> 16:07.220
But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.060
Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans.

16:09.060 --> 16:12.660
To a person who believes that dogs go to heaven.

16:12.660 --> 16:18.120
And in most circumstances, saying I'm a female soul in a male body gets the point across.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.280
Not all language is philosophical.

16:20.280 --> 16:24.220
It's a lot easier to explain what being trans is in essentialist terms.

16:24.220 --> 16:28.820
To explain it without gender essentialism requires a whole complicated philosophical

16:28.820 --> 16:32.240
discussion that most people simply aren't up to having.

16:32.240 --> 16:36.320
But the useful platitudes become a problem when more analytically-minded people start

16:36.320 --> 16:38.400
putting these things under the microscope.

16:38.400 --> 16:41.940
And then they end up concluding that trans people are just fetishists who are telling

16:41.940 --> 16:43.440
lies about themselves.

16:43.440 --> 16:47.580
So you're probably wondering, if I'm not a fetishist, and not essentially a woman,

16:47.580 --> 16:48.580
then why am I transitioning?

16:48.580 --> 16:53.640
Well, I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was the primary reason.

16:53.640 --> 16:57.880
And shortly before I transitioned, I made a whole video about that, if you're curious.

16:57.880 --> 17:01.080
You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom.

17:01.080 --> 17:04.860
When you decide you're going to live as a woman, you have to do that at the grocery

17:04.860 --> 17:06.400
store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.400
You have to do that at the grocery store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with

17:07.400 --> 17:08.400
your family.

17:08.400 --> 17:09.400
You have to do that at the grocery store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner

17:09.400 --> 17:10.400
with your family, if you even still have a family.

17:10.400 --> 17:15.080
It's kind of hard for me to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory

17:15.080 --> 17:16.080
urge.

17:16.080 --> 17:19.880
That said, is there some sexual aspect of being transgender?

17:19.880 --> 17:24.160
Well of course there goddamn is, how could an adult decide to switch genders without

17:24.160 --> 17:26.260
there being some connection to sexuality?

17:26.260 --> 17:30.780
The problem is, autogynephilia is not a good description of that connection in most cases,

17:30.780 --> 17:33.200
and it certainly isn't in my case.

17:33.200 --> 17:37.400
But I'm a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women and cross-dressing

17:37.400 --> 17:39.760
in erotic situations, no less.

17:39.760 --> 17:42.920
According to Blanchard's theory, I'm therefore an autogynephile.

17:42.920 --> 17:45.400
It seems that I have some explaining to do.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.400
Well, here's where the filth comes in.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.400
6.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.520
Contrapoints in erotic life

17:51.520 --> 17:55.400
Come one, come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.580
Step right up, you filthy freaks.

17:57.580 --> 18:01.440
One of the reasons it's difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard's theory is that

18:01.440 --> 18:06.080
even arguing against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and

18:06.080 --> 18:07.080
invalidating.

18:07.080 --> 18:11.360
Unfortunately, I have no sense of self-respect or dignity whatsoever, so I'm willing to take

18:11.360 --> 18:12.640
one for the team here.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.300
Get your clipboards out, gentlemen!

18:14.300 --> 18:19.080
I want to make this as easy as possible for the psychoanalysts at home.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.520
I was born in 1988.

18:21.520 --> 18:25.960
As a small child, I was not especially feminine nor especially masculine.

18:25.960 --> 18:31.040
I was not interested in sports, and was just kind of physically inept.

18:31.040 --> 18:34.840
My main childhood interest was music, and I learned several instruments.

18:34.840 --> 18:36.960
In early adolescence, I was misdiagnosed with OCD.

18:36.960 --> 18:42.580
The primary symptoms being spending too much time in the shower, and spending too much

18:42.580 --> 18:44.200
time styling my hair.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.200
My sexual development was kind of late.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.160
I never masturbated till I was 15.

18:49.160 --> 18:54.340
And I didn't fantasize about having sex with women, or with men, or even about becoming

18:54.340 --> 18:55.340
a woman.

18:55.340 --> 18:58.040
My fantasies were kind of platonic, almost.

18:58.040 --> 19:02.740
I would sort of fantasize about women, but in a very abstract kind of way.

19:02.740 --> 19:06.920
An early romantic disappointment involved my realization that women would never be a

19:06.920 --> 19:07.920
woman.

19:07.920 --> 19:10.960
They would be attracted to me in the same way that I was attracted to them.

19:10.960 --> 19:15.520
In my late teens and early twenties, I was a long-haired, smooth-chested androgyne, which

19:15.520 --> 19:16.680
suited me well.

19:16.680 --> 19:21.360
It was around then that I first cross-dressed, when a woman I was seeing asked if she could

19:21.360 --> 19:24.540
dress me up in her clothes, and do my makeup.

19:24.540 --> 19:27.320
God yes, I said.

19:27.320 --> 19:31.040
Throughout my twenties, I was on and off in relationships where there was this feminization

19:31.040 --> 19:32.120
dynamic.

19:32.120 --> 19:35.340
More women are into feminizing boys than you might think.

19:35.340 --> 19:36.300
When I was feminized, it would just be me.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.880
When I was feminized, we would just make out and not do anything penetrative, but just

19:39.880 --> 19:43.120
sort of little proto-lesbian things, you know?

19:43.120 --> 19:47.480
Now some women I was with were not into that, and some would practically lock their underwear

19:47.480 --> 19:49.940
drawers when they found out I had done it in the past.

19:49.940 --> 19:54.100
There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that altogether, but it didn't last

19:54.100 --> 19:55.820
more than a couple years.

19:55.820 --> 20:00.780
When I had regular heterosexual sex, it was like my soul had to leave my body in order

20:00.780 --> 20:03.620
for me to get the poison out, which is how I thought of it.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.300
The cross-dressing was never a solo or a masturbatory activity.

20:05.300 --> 20:10.180
There was always a partner, or sometimes several partners.

20:10.180 --> 20:12.480
Bailey, are you paying attention to this?

20:12.480 --> 20:13.560
This is for you.

20:13.560 --> 20:17.620
What I liked about it was the way that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted

20:17.620 --> 20:20.760
with my body, how they would kind of treat me like a woman.

20:20.760 --> 20:25.060
I fully acknowledge that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic.

20:25.060 --> 20:31.060
There was a lot of short dresses and thigh highs, and occasionally also a BDSM submissive

20:31.060 --> 20:32.160
aspect.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.200
But over time, I realized that the fetish aspect wasn't really what I liked about it.

20:33.200 --> 20:34.200
I didn't like it.

20:34.200 --> 20:35.200
I didn't like it.

20:35.200 --> 20:35.280
I didn't like it.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.300
I didn't like it.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.300
I didn't like it.

20:37.300 --> 20:38.300
I didn't like it.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.300
It wasn't humiliating for me to be feminized.

20:39.300 --> 20:40.300
It was affirming.

20:40.300 --> 20:44.740
And one day, I kind of realized that I didn't want to be feminized at all.

20:44.740 --> 20:47.140
I wanted to be feminine.

20:47.140 --> 20:51.440
In my mid-twenties, I first started really paying attention to trans women and thinking

20:51.440 --> 20:56.240
about transitioning myself, but I thought that, since I didn't feel like a woman, that

20:56.240 --> 21:00.180
I never would, and I thought that I would never pass and that I would just be a hideous

21:00.180 --> 21:01.840
parody of womanhood.

21:01.840 --> 21:05.200
Then about a year ago, thanks to this amazing online queer community that we have now, I

21:05.200 --> 21:08.800
started developing more positive thinking about this.

21:08.800 --> 21:12.840
I've always looked a little bit younger than my age, but last year I also started noticing

21:12.840 --> 21:17.860
the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man, and that triggered

21:17.860 --> 21:19.920
really intense gender dysphoria.

21:19.920 --> 21:23.820
At the same time, I realized that I would have to transition to have any hope of a genuinely

21:23.820 --> 21:25.260
fulfilling sex life.

21:25.260 --> 21:29.240
And at that point, the need to transition felt so urgent that I could not wait.

21:29.240 --> 21:34.200
So I got internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu, and I started taking those in

21:34.200 --> 21:38.460
August until I could get a prescription from an informed consent clinic.

21:38.460 --> 21:41.340
And since then, my life has drastically changed.

21:41.340 --> 21:45.880
I live as a woman full-time now, and most of the changes aren't sexual, but the hormones

21:45.880 --> 21:48.140
certainly do have sexual effects.

21:48.140 --> 21:53.880
I now find myself attracted to both women and men, and the mere visual image of a woman

21:53.880 --> 21:56.880
no longer turns me on the way it did.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.900
Instead, I need there to be a certain kind of interpersonal connection.

22:00.900 --> 22:03.640
I don't masturbate at all, and I haven't come in months.

22:03.640 --> 22:05.400
Someone, please fuck me.

22:05.400 --> 22:10.020
I guess the critical thing is that I've been wearing women's clothes, my clothes, for seven

22:10.020 --> 22:14.820
consecutive months, and I have been turned on by it for zero percent of the time.

22:14.820 --> 22:18.580
So the idea that I'm some kind of transvestite fetishist is ridiculous.

22:18.580 --> 22:22.080
And I'm not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.920
I mean, when there's developments, I'll check it out.

22:24.920 --> 22:27.700
But I'm not like, oh yeah, I have tits now, that's so hot.

22:27.700 --> 22:30.000
I mean, it's kind of hot.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.640
But it's more about other people being into it than it is about me.

22:33.640 --> 22:34.700
Being into it.

22:34.700 --> 22:38.300
So as always, my sex drive is directed outward at other people.

22:38.300 --> 22:42.880
The sexual aspect of my transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed

22:42.880 --> 22:43.980
inward.

22:43.980 --> 22:49.640
It's about me wanting my sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.120
Or, you know, at least as close as I can get.

22:52.120 --> 22:56.580
And since I started hormones, it's about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically

22:56.580 --> 23:02.520
female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection.

23:02.520 --> 23:03.520
Rather than being a woman.

23:03.520 --> 23:08.060
Rather than intense, object-oriented male lust.

23:08.060 --> 23:12.360
So that's my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to politically correct

23:12.360 --> 23:16.440
cuckoldry or trans ideology.

23:16.440 --> 23:19.960
Now I've read enough Blanchard to know that this description in no way lets me off the

23:19.960 --> 23:20.960
hook for autogynephilia.

23:20.960 --> 23:27.860
In fact, I'm what Blanchard would call a classic case of pseudobisexual behavioral autogynephilia.

23:27.860 --> 23:33.020
Pseudobisexual because of course all trans women's experiences are lies, and because,

23:33.020 --> 23:37.080
according to Blanchard, I only like guys because being filled up with their dicks makes

23:37.080 --> 23:39.800
me feel like a girl, which is what I'm really into.

23:39.800 --> 23:44.900
And behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogynephilia, like anatomic,

23:44.900 --> 23:49.700
transvestic, behavioral, and physiological, according to what you supposedly fetishize.

23:49.700 --> 23:54.320
And I'm turned on by sexually behaving like a woman, rather than simply wearing female

23:54.320 --> 23:56.320
clothes or having female anatomy.

23:56.320 --> 24:01.020
And I mean, okay, you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary, fake,

24:01.020 --> 24:02.020
and pathological.

24:02.020 --> 24:03.020
But I think this isn't a sense of reality.

24:03.020 --> 24:08.020
It's an especially unfair way to characterize my experience, and here's why.

24:08.020 --> 24:10.740
7.

24:10.740 --> 24:11.740
Autophilia in general

24:11.740 --> 24:15.680
I'm guessing that most people would be pretty reluctant to admit that they take any kind

24:15.680 --> 24:17.980
of sexual interest in their own bodies.

24:17.980 --> 24:20.840
It's sort of like admitting that you enjoy your own body odor.

24:20.840 --> 24:21.840
Ew.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.380
But how unusual is it to check yourself out?

24:24.380 --> 24:27.980
To take some sexual interest in the sight or touch of your own body?

24:27.980 --> 24:32.280
I've noticed that cis men seem to really like their own penises.

24:32.280 --> 24:36.560
And taking pictures of their penises and sending them to other people.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.140
Does that make them autoandrophiles?

24:39.140 --> 24:42.000
Are they behavioral autophallophiles?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.000
I can make up Greek words too, Blanchard.

24:44.000 --> 24:48.640
I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me,

24:48.640 --> 24:51.160
It's not for men, it's for me.

24:51.160 --> 24:52.160
What does that mean?

24:52.160 --> 24:57.000
It means she enjoyed wearing sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
hot.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
Is that cisvestic autogynephilia?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.000
Likewise.

25:01.000 --> 25:05.900
I used to date cis women, I know what they do, and I can tell you that women touching

25:05.900 --> 25:10.640
their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.060
Is that anatomical autogynephilia?

25:13.060 --> 25:18.160
Twitter user Nathan of Oz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo, an article

25:18.160 --> 25:23.620
on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their own

25:23.620 --> 25:28.980
feet or running a feather over their skin as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length

25:28.980 --> 25:30.520
mirror and rubbing one out.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.620
Possibly while squatting on a dildo.

25:33.620 --> 25:37.480
Can you imagine the level of paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if

25:37.480 --> 25:39.000
it was written by a trans woman?

25:39.000 --> 25:42.720
I mean it's one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot.

25:42.720 --> 25:47.480
And okay, Cosmo's sex advice is often ludicrous, but the point is, it seems like it's only

25:47.480 --> 25:51.740
when it comes to trans women that we feel the need to whip out the suffix "-philia".

25:51.740 --> 25:56.340
It seems what's going on here is a lot of pathologizing of normal female sexuality when

25:56.340 --> 25:58.280
it exists in trans women.

25:58.280 --> 25:59.420
But of course that raises the question, what is transphilia?

25:59.420 --> 26:00.420
What is transphilia?

26:00.520 --> 26:03.020
What is normal female sexuality?

26:03.020 --> 26:05.980
8.

26:05.980 --> 26:09.600
Normal Female Sexuality Switching from male to female hormones causes

26:09.600 --> 26:14.220
your sex drive to be completely obliterated and then regrown in new form, which came as

26:14.220 --> 26:16.620
more of a relief to me than I expected.

26:16.620 --> 26:21.400
I don't think I realized the extent to which my own sexuality felt like a demonic possession

26:21.400 --> 26:25.500
or alien infection until I was free of it, thank god.

26:25.500 --> 26:29.660
When I had male hormones in me I needed to have an orgasm like every day, I was turned

26:29.660 --> 26:34.820
on mainly by visual arousal cues, I was at a Kinsey 1 relative to my birth sex, and I

26:34.820 --> 26:40.760
had a couple mild, typical, straight guy paraphilic kinks, no, not autogynephilia.

26:40.760 --> 26:44.760
On female hormones I initially had no sex drive at all, but have started developing

26:44.760 --> 26:46.960
very different patterns of arousal.

26:46.960 --> 26:52.340
For instance, I never need to have an orgasm, I'm turned on mainly by interpersonal cues

26:52.340 --> 26:58.000
like intimate physical contact or close emotional moments, I'm at around a 70-30 attraction

26:58.000 --> 26:59.500
to women vs men.

26:59.500 --> 27:02.220
And the paraphilic kinks have vanished without a trace.

27:02.220 --> 27:07.840
Oh by the way, for the pharmacologists at home, this is 6mg estradiol and 200mg spironolactone

27:07.840 --> 27:08.840
daily.

27:08.840 --> 27:13.300
So my interpretation of all this is that I have what is a pretty typical female sexuality,

27:13.300 --> 27:15.020
at least for a girl who's into girls.

27:15.020 --> 27:20.360
I don't feel like I have some essentially male, pseudo-bisexual, behavioral autogynephilia.

27:20.360 --> 27:24.300
One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with elaborate terminology like this is

27:24.300 --> 27:28.800
he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women are psychologically more like

27:28.800 --> 27:30.540
cis men than cis women.

27:30.540 --> 27:35.020
His studies therefore lack a cis female control group, meaning he didn't bother to apply

27:35.020 --> 27:37.600
his autogynephilia survey to cis women.

27:37.600 --> 27:41.980
But if he had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were

27:41.980 --> 27:44.140
classified as autogynephilic.

27:44.140 --> 27:49.560
Blanchard's insistence on classifying trans women's sexuality as a variant on male sexuality

27:49.560 --> 27:54.640
makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.140
But what do cis women want to have sex as?

27:57.140 --> 27:58.140
Walruses?

27:58.140 --> 27:59.720
I mean, no judgements.

27:59.720 --> 28:05.900
This also explains his claim that non-exclusively androphilic trans women are pseudo-bisexual

28:05.900 --> 28:09.920
because their attraction to men does not resemble gay male attraction to men.

28:09.920 --> 28:15.460
The idea is that these trans women's attraction to men is not based on raw physical lust,

28:15.460 --> 28:20.560
so it is therefore unlike gay male attraction to men, and is therefore pseudo.

28:20.560 --> 28:25.180
That is, it's really an autogynephilic fantasy where the man is just a prop.

28:25.180 --> 28:27.880
But what about straight cis women's attraction to men?

28:27.880 --> 28:31.460
Is that based on raw physical lust for the male body?

28:31.460 --> 28:36.200
I mean, sometimes it probably is, and I'm not a cis woman so I can't really say.

28:36.200 --> 28:42.700
But I kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust

28:42.700 --> 28:44.160
for the male body.

28:44.160 --> 28:49.200
That is, I suspect it's quite different from cis male homosexuality, if I may risk

28:49.200 --> 28:51.040
painting with broad strokes.

28:51.040 --> 28:55.560
Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist articles alongside

28:55.560 --> 28:56.560
Naked Hunks but never had the circulation of a trans woman.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.560
It's not a real thing.

28:57.560 --> 29:00.400
It's more of a representation of its male counterpart, and later on ended up just being

29:00.400 --> 29:01.980
read by gay men.

29:01.980 --> 29:06.240
From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean, men's bodies are nice, they have

29:06.240 --> 29:10.860
great hands, great abs, great this part, it's all great.

29:10.860 --> 29:12.460
But it's not that great.

29:12.460 --> 29:16.420
And if you read pornography written by women, and notice that it's usually written and

29:16.420 --> 29:21.840
not photographed, you don't find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies.

29:21.840 --> 29:26.300
Like in Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read for research purposes, there's some description

29:27.560 --> 29:30.880
of male bodies, but it's not the main thing by any means.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.960
There's a lot more sentences like,

29:32.960 --> 29:37.560
To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat ten adults comfortably.

29:37.560 --> 29:42.620
It faces a state-of-the-art stainless steel, or maybe platinum for all I know.

29:42.620 --> 29:43.980
Modern fireplace.

29:43.980 --> 29:49.160
Near the kitchen area, in front of the glass wall, is a dining table surrounded by sixteen

29:49.160 --> 29:50.160
chairs.

29:50.160 --> 29:54.560
And tucked in the corner is a full-sized, shiny black grand piano.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.440
Here, he hands me a glass of wine.

29:57.440 --> 30:01.620
Even the glasses are rich, heavy, contemporary crystal.

30:01.620 --> 30:03.340
It's like a Crate and Barrel catalog.

30:03.340 --> 30:04.980
I'm getting so wet.

30:04.980 --> 30:09.960
Christian is established as a man of good taste, as evinced by his contemporary crystal,

30:09.960 --> 30:15.280
his playing Bach at the piano, and that's hot, because it's sexy to be wanted by someone

30:15.280 --> 30:16.600
who's qualified.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.720
It's not enough to be whistled at by a cat caller, they have no discernment.

30:19.720 --> 30:23.200
I mean, they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.200
They whistle at me.

30:24.200 --> 30:25.760
And I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

30:25.760 --> 30:26.760
I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

30:26.760 --> 30:26.960
I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

30:27.440 --> 30:28.440
I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

30:28.440 --> 30:32.320
You want to be wanted by someone who, with their exquisite and discriminating taste,

30:32.320 --> 30:34.400
selects you, the protagonist.

30:34.400 --> 30:38.360
This is not a story about Christian's rippling abs and his tight buns.

30:38.360 --> 30:40.880
It's not a story about wanting a man.

30:40.880 --> 30:44.160
It's a story about being wanted by a man.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.440
This is how the whole romance genre works.

30:46.440 --> 30:51.020
You emotionally identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who's like

30:51.020 --> 30:56.560
a pirate or the CEO of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this

30:56.560 --> 30:56.760
guy wants you.

30:56.760 --> 31:02.460
The protagonist, usually singling her out over other more qualified women, and eventually

31:02.460 --> 31:05.940
giving up everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her.

31:05.940 --> 31:08.160
And a lot of these stories are kind of silly.

31:08.160 --> 31:12.340
They conflate female sexuality with women's economic dependence on men in a way that's

31:12.340 --> 31:18.660
really problematic, but I fundamentally resonate with the wish to be wanted.

31:18.660 --> 31:22.000
I want other people to think I'm sexy and want to fuck me, you know?

31:22.000 --> 31:25.540
It makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside.

31:25.540 --> 31:26.540
Is that so wrong?

31:26.760 --> 31:30.080
9.

31:30.080 --> 31:31.320
Female Vanity

31:31.320 --> 31:36.100
The art critic John Berger wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting

31:36.100 --> 31:41.400
trope of depainting a nude woman with a mirror and calling the painting vanity.

31:41.400 --> 31:44.940
The mirror was often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman.

31:44.940 --> 31:47.680
The moralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.

31:47.680 --> 31:51.060
You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her.

31:51.060 --> 31:55.420
You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting vanity, thus morally condemning

31:55.420 --> 31:56.560
the woman whose nakedness you despise.

31:56.560 --> 31:56.600
9.

31:56.600 --> 31:57.880
Female Vanity

31:57.880 --> 32:00.700
The real function of the mirror was otherwise.

32:00.700 --> 32:05.900
It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.

32:05.900 --> 32:11.480
The notion of the vanity of woman is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection.

32:11.480 --> 32:16.280
It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy

32:16.280 --> 32:20.180
looking at them, and are hence complicit in their own objectification.

32:20.180 --> 32:24.820
I think the concept of the autogynephilic transsexual woman is a combination of this

32:24.820 --> 32:25.920
trope with a homophobic trope.

32:25.920 --> 32:32.800
Misogyny casts women as narcissistic, vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts

32:32.800 --> 32:35.280
queer men as hypersexual perverts.

32:35.280 --> 32:40.080
The autogynephile is the ultimate combination of the two, the hypersexual pervert vainly

32:40.080 --> 32:42.760
in love with the image of himself as a woman.

32:42.760 --> 32:43.760
10.

32:43.760 --> 32:50.000
Autogynephilia is a misogynistic trope that originates in the image of a woman.

32:50.000 --> 32:54.840
It is a misogynistic trope that originates in the image of a woman.

32:54.840 --> 32:55.800
10.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.360
Autogynephilia is the ultimate combination of the two, the autogynephilia and the paraphilia

32:57.360 --> 32:58.360
acceptance.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.120
So this whole video I've been treating autogynephilia kind of like an accusation, from which I have

33:01.120 --> 33:02.820
to exonerate myself.

33:02.820 --> 33:07.120
And I think it's justifiable considering I'm objecting to misrepresentation, but some people

33:07.120 --> 33:12.520
might wonder isn't this whole conversation getting kind of kink-shame-y, like, is autogynephilia

33:12.520 --> 33:13.520
so wrong?

33:13.520 --> 33:15.520
Well, no, it's not.

33:15.520 --> 33:16.680
It's fine.

33:16.680 --> 33:20.320
There definitely are men who get turned on by wearing women's clothes or thinking about

33:20.320 --> 33:25.120
having a female body, and as paraphilias go, this is very harmless, and I don't think it's

33:25.120 --> 33:29.100
anything to be ashamed of. But the question of whether genuinely autogynephilic trans women

33:29.100 --> 33:34.520
exist is more complicated. The reason most trans women consider the label autogynephilia to be such

33:34.520 --> 33:40.920
a stigma is that, as Blanchard says, women do not get turned on merely by the thought of being women.

33:41.160 --> 33:45.960
Now as I've discussed, the problem with Blanchard is he overextends the concept of autogynephilia

33:45.960 --> 33:51.420
to cover pretty much any sexual feeling a cluster B trans woman can have. But I'm actually inclined

33:51.420 --> 33:56.900
to agree with him that being turned on merely by the thought of being a woman is a fundamentally

33:56.900 --> 34:01.640
non-female state of mind, and one that feels quite foreign to me. So a lot of trans women,

34:01.780 --> 34:06.540
I guess including me, have the idea that you can't be both a woman and an autogynephile,

34:06.820 --> 34:11.220
hence the offense we take to being characterized in this way. However, things get messier when

34:11.220 --> 34:15.560
you look into this some more. Are there some genuinely autogynephilic transsexuals?

34:15.940 --> 34:20.440
Well, at first glance, the answer is yes. I mean, there's always one, isn't there?

34:20.440 --> 34:21.400
In this case, though,

34:21.420 --> 34:26.560
one is Anne Lawrence, a disciple of Blanchard and self-identified autogynephilic transsexual.

34:26.860 --> 34:33.520
From 1998 to 2011, Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogynephilia over the internet

34:33.520 --> 34:40.020
and published them in her 2012 book, Men Trapped in Men's Bodies. Great title, Anne. Very provocative,

34:40.380 --> 34:46.080
very controversial, very politically incorrect. I have been triggered. Well done. What is this

34:46.080 --> 34:50.220
cover, though? Come on, Anne. Get a statue of hermaphroditus or something on there.

34:50.220 --> 34:51.400
So this book is filled with a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff.

34:51.400 --> 34:55.660
It's a lot of the stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty autogynephilia-like

34:55.660 --> 35:01.700
fantasy and behavior. So what do we make of that? Well, a lot of this stuff, like fantasies of being

35:01.700 --> 35:06.360
women or having sex as women or arousal during cross-dressing, are what the trans community

35:06.360 --> 35:11.700
has destigmatizingly termed cross-sex gender fantasy. And among trans women, particularly

35:11.700 --> 35:17.540
prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty common. You'll see it all over the place on trans

35:17.540 --> 35:21.380
subreddits. There's a blog called CrossDreamers devoted to it. There's a blog called CrossDreamers

35:21.400 --> 35:25.180
devoted to it. It's been written about by Zinnia Jones and Giulia Serrano. So within the trans

35:25.180 --> 35:30.160
community, this isn't even controversial. It's not provocative. It's not politically incorrect.

35:30.600 --> 35:34.660
But how do we make sense of this? Well, my thinking is that it's pretty hard to experience

35:34.660 --> 35:39.460
genuine female sexuality when you've still got the evil magic of testosterone in your system.

35:39.820 --> 35:44.380
So you've got to get that out, and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away. But how is

35:44.380 --> 35:48.800
this any different from Blanchard's theory of autogynephilia? Well, basically, it comes down to

35:48.800 --> 35:51.380
this. Blanchard's theory claims that cross-dressing is a form of sexism. It's a form of sexism. It's a

35:51.400 --> 35:56.880
gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential. In this theory, if you're an autogynephilic

35:56.880 --> 36:02.440
transsexual, you are essentially male, and any facsimile of womanhood you achieve can only be

36:02.440 --> 36:07.980
honestly understood as the expression of an essentially male sexual urge. I reject the idea

36:07.980 --> 36:12.420
that it's causal or essential, and I think the strongest piece of evidence that it isn't essential

36:12.420 --> 36:17.840
is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogynephilic admit that after transition,

36:17.840 --> 36:20.400
the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes,

36:20.400 --> 36:25.360
yet they continue to prefer living as trans women. Blanchard made this observation himself.

36:50.400 --> 37:00.720
If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become women, why would they

37:00.720 --> 37:05.940
continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away? Well, this is where

37:05.940 --> 37:10.840
things get really weird. According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only way to explain this is to

37:10.840 --> 37:15.760
shift the goalpost and say that actually, autogynephilia isn't a paraphilia at all.

37:15.760 --> 37:20.360
It's actually a sexual orientation. So what happens when you transition is you

37:20.400 --> 37:26.080
actually pair-bond with yourself, forming a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman you've

37:26.080 --> 37:31.280
become. And if that sounds like it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all, it's because it doesn't.

37:31.280 --> 37:35.920
A pair-bond is a social relationship between two or more people. Are you saying that trans women

37:35.920 --> 37:40.960
are a man and a woman inside this- why do they continue falling in love with other people-

37:40.960 --> 37:44.560
I can't even start with this. This video is too long, I'm getting cranky. Look, this seems like

37:44.560 --> 37:50.400
the point where Occam's Razor shuts down Blanchard's theory. Like, okay, maybe I subconsciously created

37:50.400 --> 37:55.920
a female alter-ego with which my original male ego has fallen in love. But maybe lots of things.

37:55.920 --> 38:01.200
Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father. Maybe the elder gods ripped

38:01.200 --> 38:06.400
my primordial duality in twain, and now I'm yearning for my female half. Or maybe I'm just

38:06.400 --> 38:09.120
a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.680
11. True autogynephiles

38:13.680 --> 38:18.480
Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence's book, there are, admittedly, a few accounts of trans

38:18.480 --> 38:20.320
women whose primary sexuality is the same as that of a woman who has a male ego. And that's because

38:20.320 --> 38:24.000
a woman's sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does appear to be genuinely

38:24.000 --> 38:28.480
autogynephilic. And I'm not gonna say that these people are lying about their experiences,

38:28.480 --> 38:34.080
because that would be a terrible thing to do. Ultimately, ContraPoints is not a channel about

38:34.080 --> 38:39.200
judging people, so I'm not gonna say that these people aren't really trans. I mean, I find it

38:39.200 --> 38:45.200
weird and hard to imagine, but whatever. I'm the one who's into people licking milk off my tits.

38:45.200 --> 38:49.680
And wait till you see my sex robot. And look, if I had autogynephilic feelings,

38:49.680 --> 38:53.920
I would just tell you. I've already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn't tell my own

38:53.920 --> 38:59.360
diary on my deathbed. But I just don't. This theory doesn't describe my conscious motivations

38:59.360 --> 39:03.600
to transition. And that's ultimately the reason most trans women hate this theory,

39:03.600 --> 39:07.520
not because of wounded narcissism or shattered erotic delusions. We just

39:07.520 --> 39:11.280
don't like being misrepresented. But you know who does love this theory?

39:13.040 --> 39:15.120
She's been there literally the whole time.

39:15.120 --> 39:19.360
You know, I realize that by talking about this, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of ruthless,

39:19.360 --> 39:24.080
psychoanalysis. Whether it's gonna come from TERF Reddit, or trans people who are mad at me for

39:24.080 --> 39:30.000
even talking about this, or who knows, maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves. So you know what,

39:30.000 --> 39:34.560
why don't we just get that out of the way right now. It's time to put this tranny on trial.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.320
12. The Autogynephilia Trial of ContraPoints

39:39.520 --> 39:44.160
All rise. The Autogynephilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session.

39:44.160 --> 39:45.520
Judge Bailey presiding.

39:46.560 --> 39:49.200
Calling the case of the gender-critical subreddit versus

39:49.360 --> 39:51.520
ContraPoints. Are both sides ready?

39:53.520 --> 39:56.320
District Attorney Cockbane, ready for the subreddit, Your Honor?

39:57.600 --> 39:58.960
Ready, I guess.

39:58.960 --> 40:04.160
Your Honor, ladies of the subreddit, the defendant is a man. A full-grown,

40:04.160 --> 40:07.280
six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.200
It's really more of a hospital gown?

40:09.200 --> 40:13.520
The evidence will show that the defendant is not a woman, but a male pervert,

40:13.520 --> 40:17.040
role-playing as such, for his own twisted sexual amusement.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.640
Abigail, what are you holding?

40:18.640 --> 40:20.480
It's for horseback riding.

40:20.480 --> 40:24.320
Your Honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip,

40:24.320 --> 40:28.240
uploaded to YouTube by the defendant on June 13th, 2016.

40:38.320 --> 40:39.120
Oh, God.

40:39.120 --> 40:43.920
Fishnets, garter belts, corsets. If these are not the trappings of an autogynephile,

40:43.920 --> 40:48.400
then I don't have 2x chromosomes. Agreed. Well, what do you have to say for yourself?

40:48.640 --> 40:52.080
Well, why do you think I had all that fetish stuff in the first place?

40:52.080 --> 40:55.520
The court does not need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals.

40:55.520 --> 40:57.600
I bought that stuff for Rocky Horror.

40:57.600 --> 40:58.320
What?

40:58.320 --> 41:02.000
Rocky Horror Picture Show. I used to do Frankenfurter.

41:02.000 --> 41:05.280
Your Honor, I'd like to admit into evidence the following photograph.

41:05.280 --> 41:09.840
That's me at E Street Cinema in 2014. This one's on the house, Kiwi Farms.

41:09.840 --> 41:11.840
Are you a Rocky Horror fan, Your Honor?

41:11.840 --> 41:12.400
Am I?

41:13.200 --> 41:17.600
It's just a jump to the left and take a step to the right.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.240
Put your hands on your hips.

41:21.360 --> 41:26.880
And bring your knees in tight. But it's the pelvic thrust.

41:26.880 --> 41:27.600
Ew.

41:27.600 --> 41:30.480
So you liked to dress up as another cross-dressing autogynephile.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.240
How is that helping your case at all?

41:32.240 --> 41:36.080
Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic.

41:36.080 --> 41:37.280
But when you're living as a man,

41:37.280 --> 41:41.280
there aren't a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try out cross-dressing.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.400
You know, it's basically Rocky Horror, Halloween,

41:44.400 --> 41:47.680
pretty much any time it's socially allowed to be a freakish monster.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.640
And come to think of it,

41:48.640 --> 41:53.760
the scary monster autogynephile is a trope I've played with since the beginning of this channel.

41:53.760 --> 41:58.320
The whole ContraPoints aesthetic is very like autogynephilia-chic.

41:58.320 --> 42:02.640
I originally was going to have the narrator of this channel be more of a fictional character.

42:02.640 --> 42:06.160
The idea was to be like autogynephile Harry Plinkett.

42:06.160 --> 42:08.480
And part of that is that I kind of hated myself.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.400
I thought I was just disgusting.

42:10.400 --> 42:13.440
Part of it is that representing yourself as a scary monster

42:13.440 --> 42:16.800
actually does capture something of the horror of gender dysphoria.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.640
And part of it is that identifying with the horror of gender dysphoria,

42:18.640 --> 42:24.520
with a scary monster version of yourself is actually kind of empowering, like cis feminists,

42:24.580 --> 42:29.880
you have your thing about witches. Okay, but monster version or not, real women do not wear

42:29.880 --> 42:34.340
fishnets and garter belts and corsets. This is just male fetishism. Well, it's true that cis

42:34.340 --> 42:39.360
women generally don't dress that way, no. I mean, unless they're doing Rocky Horror, it's actually

42:39.360 --> 42:43.640
pretty popular. But I never wear shit like that anymore. In fact, it actually causes gender

42:43.640 --> 42:47.900
dysphoria because it makes me feel like a male cross-dresser. Sometimes trans women start out

42:47.900 --> 42:52.760
with a fairly male conception of what women wear. I guess that's true. A lot of trans women

42:52.760 --> 42:57.680
transition after a period of sort of trying things out as a cross-dresser or a drag queen.

42:58.020 --> 43:01.860
But you know, it takes time to develop an authentic sense of female fashion. Like,

43:01.860 --> 43:03.680
what did you wear when you were 14?

43:09.480 --> 43:14.400
That's what I thought. But also, why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters?

43:14.820 --> 43:17.640
Cis women do. They have some good ideas. Without

43:17.640 --> 43:17.880
drag queens and kinksters, they don't have any.

43:17.900 --> 43:22.440
Without drag queens and kinksters, we'd have no contouring, no chokers. And what would we do then,

43:22.440 --> 43:26.640
Abigail? What would we do then? I don't know what you would do. I think I could manage.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.600
Your Honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following clip.

43:30.120 --> 43:35.260
Is there a way to smash my ribs in? I'll smash them in. I'll smash the shit out of them.

43:36.380 --> 43:40.000
These shoes are cute, and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.

43:41.700 --> 43:47.880
Would you fuck me? I wouldn't. Your Honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and

43:47.900 --> 43:53.480
corsets in front of a mirror before posing to himself the question, would you fuck me? This,

43:53.480 --> 43:56.240
Your Honor, is peak trans.

43:58.760 --> 44:06.920
How do we even need to have a trial about this? Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish,

44:07.060 --> 44:11.720
not sexual pleasure. Would you fuck me is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs,

44:11.960 --> 44:16.920
and is what is known in the trans community as a joke. The corsets, the high heels, these were

44:16.920 --> 44:17.840
primitive efforts.

44:17.840 --> 44:22.300
at clawing my way out of manhood, and they're efforts that I've left behind. Now that I'm on

44:22.300 --> 44:27.100
female hormones and I live this way full-time, I feel the way I'm supposed to feel, and I don't

44:27.100 --> 44:31.480
need to lean on that stuff for validation. I mean, I still do some things that cis women don't do.

44:31.720 --> 44:36.380
I sleep in a bra, which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done. I do it because I need to

44:36.380 --> 44:41.820
feel something, God, anything, taking up space on my chest. And feeling that reassures me enough

44:41.820 --> 44:46.060
that I can fall asleep. Not so I can look at myself in the mirror, not so I can get off,

44:46.060 --> 44:47.780
so I can simply fall asleep.

44:48.000 --> 44:52.440
No one ever claimed that trans women are literally the same as cis women. We have many experiences

44:52.440 --> 44:56.540
in common, but in other ways our experiences are very different. Yes, and you don't have the

44:56.540 --> 45:01.640
oppression experiences that cis women have. Well, you know what, Abigail? You're right. For the most

45:01.640 --> 45:06.260
part, I don't. But it's impossible for us to have an actual conversation about this because you're

45:06.260 --> 45:10.400
just such a fucking asshole. And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression

45:10.400 --> 45:15.240
experiences, don't have this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago.

45:15.240 --> 45:17.720
Go find someone who transitioned decades ago,

45:17.840 --> 45:20.400
and talk to them about their experiences as women.

45:20.400 --> 45:23.920
Your honor, the defendant does not bleed. I find that pretty conclusive.

45:23.920 --> 45:25.600
As do I. Guilty as charged.

45:25.600 --> 45:29.200
13. Final Thoughts

45:29.200 --> 45:34.160
I think some cis people will be very congratulatory towards me for making this video. Some of them will

45:34.160 --> 45:39.200
say things like, why can't all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their experiences

45:39.200 --> 45:43.680
as you? Well, I'm very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I'd like cis people to

45:43.680 --> 45:44.000
think a little bit harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this. It's not just me, it's

45:44.000 --> 45:44.080
not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me,

45:44.080 --> 45:47.600
it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me.

45:47.600 --> 45:52.320
It's humiliating, it's exhausting, and it's required me to publicize a detailed analysis

45:52.320 --> 45:56.560
of my most private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me. I've had

45:56.560 --> 46:01.280
to discuss things that I'm honestly terrified to discuss, because I'm afraid that people will never

46:01.280 --> 46:06.160
take me seriously as a woman, hence ruining any chance I have at happiness. For trans women,

46:06.160 --> 46:10.720
this debate is intensely personal and risky. Our lives and happiness are at stake.

46:10.720 --> 46:13.440
Meanwhile, Blanchard and Bailey are not just neutral,

46:13.440 --> 46:18.560
devoted pursuers of scientific truth. They've continuously and needlessly been derisive and

46:18.560 --> 46:23.680
cruel toward trans people, and they've misused their power as academic authorities to misrepresent

46:23.680 --> 46:28.880
and humiliate us. No part of my present experience corresponds to the core claim of their theory.

46:28.880 --> 46:32.960
I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity,

46:32.960 --> 46:38.960
but I am at core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself. So I have to hope,

46:38.960 --> 46:42.960
for the sake of my own happiness, that someday I will be loved by someone who

46:42.960 --> 46:46.080
thinks of me as a woman. Otherwise, I'm fucked.

46:46.080 --> 46:50.400
This was a rough one girls, I dare say you've earned a song!

46:54.880 --> 47:03.440
Thanks For the times that you've given me

47:04.960 --> 47:11.600
The memories are all onto my mind

47:11.600 --> 47:11.840
And now it's my turn For the times that you've given me

47:11.840 --> 47:12.140
And now it's my turn

47:12.140 --> 47:12.880
And now it's my turn

47:12.880 --> 47:12.940
And now it's my turn

47:12.940 --> 47:27.940
Now we've come to the end of our rainbow There's something I must say out loud

47:27.940 --> 47:50.940
You're once, twice, three times a lady And I love all of you, yes I do

47:51.940 --> 47:56.940
Yes, you're once, twice

47:57.940 --> 48:02.940
Three times a lady

48:03.940 --> 48:10.940
And I love all of you, yes I do

48:11.940 --> 48:18.940
And I love you

48:19.940 --> 48:21.940
One more time

48:22.940 --> 48:25.940
And just a step to the right

48:25.940 --> 48:26.940
Put your hands on your hips!

48:28.940 --> 48:30.940
And bring your knees in tight

48:31.940 --> 48:33.940
It's just a pelvic thrust

48:34.940 --> 48:37.940
That really drives me insane

48:38.940 --> 48:42.940
Let's do the time warp again

48:44.940 --> 48:49.940
Let's do the time warp again
