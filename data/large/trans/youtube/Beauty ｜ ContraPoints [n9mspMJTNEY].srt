1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
My face is the front of shop

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,000
My face is the real shop front

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
My shop is the fake side front

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm real when I shop my face

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hey guys, it's Natalie. Welcome back to my channel. Today I'm going to do a makeup tutorial as always. But first, story time, story time, story time. I just want to be up front with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'm always going to be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean so much to me. Like, you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story. My whole entire journey.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
This journey I've been on.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
As a transgender woman.

9
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You've been with me on this whole journey.

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
This is my truth and you've accepted the truth of my journey.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
This is a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just as special because you've been here for me throughout my whole transgender journey.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The whole message of my journey as an influencer.

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's just been so impactful on my life and the truth of my living.

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's just so meaningful that you guys have made it this far.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
It really means so much to me that you guys are supporting the truth of the life experience of my transgender journey as an YouTube influencer.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
And it's been so painful and during a really vulnerable time for me.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
And I'm just so grateful to you guys because you're so meaningful and you've encouraged me.

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel is that makeup is a lot of fun but it's inner beauty that really counts.

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Anyway, let's talk about plastic surgery.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I had facial feminization surgery on April 2nd, so about a month and a half ago.

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What we call facial feminization surgery or FFS is actually a series of different procedures that some transgender women choose to have to look more feminine.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
So what I had done is forehead contouring, a brow lift, rhinoplasty, mandible contouring, a trachea shave.

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You know what, let's just have the skull lady talk you through it.

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
A coronal incision was made towards the cranial vault, whence the skin of the forehead was stripped away from the bone.

25
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
A fragment of the supra-orbital ridge was then chiselled away, removed, reshaped and re-affixed,

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:27,000
thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow that oftentimes distinguishes the skull of the child.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A second incision was made

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,620
the columella of the nasal septum,

29
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,900
facilitating the reconstruction

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,100
of the anterior cartilage and bone.

31
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,740
Further incisions were made betwixt the gum and cheek,

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,160
through which the mandible was rasped and shaved

33
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,840
down to a gracile curvature of a jaw and pointed chin,

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,640
thereby delineating a facial silhouette

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,880
exhibiting that aspect which medical men call cunty.

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,020
It all sounds pretty gruesome

37
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,320
when you describe it like that,

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,960
but there's actually a very fine level

39
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,960
of technique and aesthetics involved.

40
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,280
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,480
The results are natural,

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,300
I don't look like I've had a bunch of work done,

43
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,260
which is good, you know,

44
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,900
you at least wanna leave people wondering,

45
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,100
maybe she's born with it,

46
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,740
maybe a surgeon peeled her face off

47
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,960
and fixed her shitty skull.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,240
Here's a before and after picture

49
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,720
where you can clearly see the difference.

50
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,460
To use the exact medical terminology,

51
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:22,260
my brows on fleek, my nose is no longer busted the house,

52
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,920
my jaw snatched, and my Adam's apple is canceled.

53
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,780
Wasn't it always really Eve's apple?

54
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,900
Maybe Satan's apple?

55
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,280
I think I still look like myself.

56
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,760
It's not a new face.

57
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,900
We're talking about millimeters of bone here.

58
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,520
But to have all that done was,

59
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,440
well, it costs a lot of money.

60
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,920
The anticipation was, oh, terror like I've never known.

61
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,120
The pain was memorable.

62
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,020
And the recovery took more than a month.

63
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,200
In fact, I still have some swelling in my jowls.

64
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,140
Jowls, there's a nice feminine sounding word, love that.

65
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,260
The standard YouTube T-girl thing to do, of course,

66
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,940
would have been to vlog the whole journey.

67
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:55,420
Story time, my facial surgery experience,

68
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,740
my FFS journey, and post-constant social media,

69
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,500
and all the media updates about it.

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,980
And I am grateful to the trans women who have done that

71
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,740
because it was really helpful to me

72
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,920
to be able to watch those vlogs in advance

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,800
and know what I was getting myself into.

74
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,920
But I decided not to post about the surgery

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,020
because I wanted privacy for the recovery

76
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,360
and to just take some time to get to feel at home

77
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,560
with the results before subjecting myself

78
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,200
to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids.

79
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,620
You know, I think I've been kind of psychologically damaged

80
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,580
by reading for years the things people say

81
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,160
about my appearance online.

82
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,040
And I'm not even talking about the haters.

83
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,620
I mean, I can mostly brush them off.

84
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,000
But for instance, about a year ago,

85
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,920
I was reading through a transgender subreddit

86
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,620
and some trans woman was agonizing about her appearance

87
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,300
and someone offered the encouragement,

88
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,620
you know, you can still look hot even if you don't pass.

89
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,220
Just look at ContraPoints.

90
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,120
Ugh, like a dagger to the heart.

91
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,960
The unintentional shade of it all.

92
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,840
So the past six weeks have been, at times,

93
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,220
difficult and lonely, but I did manage to keep

94
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,660
my mug off social media for long enough

95
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,520
that I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be

96
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,400
for the commentary of the internet.

97
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,800
So bring it on, you jackals, you vultures, you goblin swine.

98
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,920
While I was lying around bandaged and bored,

99
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,540
I did have a lot of time to think.

100
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,960
And what I've been thinking about

101
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,700
is probably the same thing you're wondering right now,

102
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,500
which is why would someone do what I just did?

103
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,600
Why would I spend so much time and money

104
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,900
and go through so much anxiety and pain

105
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,600
just to change a few millimeters of bone?

106
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,660
Isn't this all just extravagant vanity,

107
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,440
some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much?

108
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,300
Well, I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me

109
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,380
to say that, in fact, this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all.

110
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,980
Usually, trans people say that surgeries

111
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,100
like facial feminization, top surgery,

112
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,960
general reassignment, and so on,

113
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,140
serve the sole purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria,

114
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,560
this discomfort we feel with the mismatch

115
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,640
between our bodies and our gender identity.

116
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,600
So what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery

117
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,640
was a medically necessary, reconstructive procedure

118
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,880
needed to make my testosterone-weathered facial bones

119
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,380
match the five-foot-two, happy baby bouncy bio girl

120
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,520
I truly am inside.

121
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,640
Thereby, alleviating my dysphoria,

122
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,680
helping me safely blend into society,

123
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,240
and preventing a five-alarm psychiatric meltdown.

124
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,080
And there is definitely truth to that.

125
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:06,920
It's certainly the argument I intend to make

126
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,640
when I write this off as a medical expense on my taxes.

127
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,440
If you're an IRS auditor, please stop this video now

128
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,640
and insert the next floppy disk into your CD drive.

129
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,080
But hypothetically speaking,

130
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,960
I think the reality might not be quite so simple.

131
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,520
How sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria

132
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,600
from the other kinds of body image dysphoria

133
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,040
that drive cisgender people

134
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,120
to get cosmetic surgery all the time?

135
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,080
Last year, when I used to foolishly tweet things of substance,

136
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,240
I tweeted that I wanted to get FFS,

137
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,080
and some trans people responded,

138
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,280
telling me that I was suffering

139
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,760
from internalized transphobia and self-loathing.

140
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,520
They compared it to East Asian people

141
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,120
getting double eyelid surgery,

142
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,960
or so-called ethnic rhinoplasty,

143
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,440
which they say are motivated by internalized racism

144
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,960
and Western beauty standards.

145
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,800
I think that's a pretty weak analogy,

146
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,000
and telling a trans person

147
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,920
to just learn to accept the way they look

148
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,160
can actually be kind of transphobic,

149
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,960
because a big part

150
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,640
of what it even means to be trans,

151
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,680
at least for me,

152
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,520
is the desire to look more female.

153
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,920
But I also think trans people often talk

154
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,360
like gender dysphoria

155
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,600
is this intrinsic, personal experience

156
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,520
that's always 100% valid

157
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,360
and never has anything at all to do

158
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,600
with the external pressure of beauty standards.

159
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,560
But in fact,

160
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:16,040
gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum

161
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,760
away from the influence of societal ideals and norms.

162
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,880
Early in my transition,

163
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,520
some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair,

164
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,600
so I had full body laser hair removal,

165
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,640
and now I'm smoother

166
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,320
than a cisgender boiled egg.

167
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,200
But where does the idea

168
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,280
that women don't have body hair come from?

169
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,520
Isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom?

170
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,800
A lot of the cis women I know

171
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,640
don't so much as shave their legs,

172
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,760
so maybe I'm not even trying to look like a cis woman.

173
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,160
Maybe I'm simply doing everything I can

174
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,800
to avoid looking like the caricature

175
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,240
of a knuckly, hairy,

176
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,880
mannish trans woman

177
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,920
with which society has terrorized me to my core.

178
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,760
Is this gender dysphoria?

179
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:55,080
Or is it internalized transphobia?

180
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,560
Or is it simply a cosmetic preference?

181
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,480
When I try to psychoanalyze myself,

182
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,880
I find that my desires to look female,

183
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,920
to look feminine,

184
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,280
and to look beautiful

185
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,800
are not exactly the same,

186
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,200
but they're woven together so tightly

187
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,520
that it's kind of difficult to untangle them.

188
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,440
And the opposite is also true,

189
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,160
that for me,

190
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,240
feeling mannish or dysphoric

191
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,480
usually goes along with feeling ugly.

192
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,680
I don't have a lot of days

193
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,280
where I walk out the house thinking,

194
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,960
well, I'm giving femme queen realness,

195
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,760
but apart from that,

196
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,120
I look like absolute shit.

197
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,440
Of course,

198
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,440
there are qualities that make you look female

199
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,360
that aren't necessarily attractive,

200
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,360
like cellulite or flabby arms,

201
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,720
which are super fish,

202
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
but aren't deemed beautiful by society.

203
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,440
The truth is,

204
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,440
I don't just want to look female,

205
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,960
I want to be beautiful.

206
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,480
Desperately.

207
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,440
God, I'll do anything.

208
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,720
Anything.

209
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,000
In this video,

210
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,920
I want to explore why I'm so obsessed

211
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,120
with being beautiful,

212
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,640
and why it seems like a lot of people

213
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,120
who live in a society are so obsessed.

214
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,080
Is it phones?

215
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,000
It's probably phones.

216
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,120
I know you're supposed to pretend

217
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,560
that you don't care about being beautiful

218
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,600
or that you're not trying,

219
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,640
but guys,

220
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,600
it's the only thing I care about

221
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,960
and I've never tried so hard at anything.

222
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:00,280
Of course,

223
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,840
I do feel guilty about being so obsessed with it,

224
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,880
because there's this idea

225
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,840
that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain.

226
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,240
You know,

227
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,960
smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty,

228
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,360
and I've always been categorized as a smart person

229
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,480
by people around me.

230
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,400
Some of that is when you're raised like I was,

231
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,120
as a middle-class white boy with no athletic talent.

232
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,320
Parents and teachers treat you like a fucking genius,

233
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,960
like Einstein nutted a load in Mozart's bussy,

234
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,320
and Mozart shat you out

235
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,840
while he was getting a rusty trombone

236
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,200
from Vincent van Gogh.

237
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,800
It inspired his famous painting,

238
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,680
Starfish Night.

239
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,800
But even among women,

240
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,960
caring about beauty is often frowned upon.

241
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,640
I feel like an alien species

242
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,640
when I hang out with women in academia,

243
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,440
and I know a few

244
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,960
because I once got half a PhD

245
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,400
before dropping out to become a,

246
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,640
what do you call someone who makes videos?

247
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,920
A cam girl.

248
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,080
Most female grad students and professors I know

249
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,040
don't wear makeup.

250
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,280
To them,

251
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,680
the idea of earnestly putting on press-on nails

252
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,920
or false eyelashes is inconceivable.

253
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,080
Like,

254
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,880
maybe on Halloween,

255
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,080
and part of that is that women in male-dominated fields

256
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,240
sometimes feel like they have to present more masculine

257
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,680
to be taken seriously,

258
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,800
because of this prejudice

259
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,520
that beautified femininity equals frivolous.

260
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,200
But another part is clearly some kind of

261
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,040
not-like-other-girls weird flex.

262
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:08,520
Which,

263
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,240
okay,

264
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:09,800
fine,

265
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,440
whatever,

266
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,800
I'm not gonna judge another woman

267
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,560
for the way she copes with a society

268
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,240
that pressures women to be beautiful

269
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,120
while simultaneously belittling them for caring about it.

270
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,280
I guess my way of coping is this tacky,

271
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,160
heteronormative,

272
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,240
and tragically sincere aspiration

273
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,960
to some kind of post-ironic feminine beauty.

274
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,080
Why am I like this?

275
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,480
Well, part of it is vindictive transsexualism,

276
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,360
pure and simple.

277
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,040
To all the people who've ever called me a man,

278
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:32,600
I wanna say,

279
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:33,960
fuck you.

280
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,320
By looking like the undeniable visual archetype of a woman,

281
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
which is a beautiful, feminine woman.

282
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,480
Who's wearing 600,000 sequins.

283
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,840
They're biological sequins.

284
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,620
Uh.

285
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:48,760
Ooh.

286
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,440
That is some ASMR right there,

287
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:50,940
listen to that.

288
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:52,780
Oh.

289
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:53,740
Oh.

290
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,920
Another factor is this shitty website.

291
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,400
I'm a professional YouTube influencer,

292
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,600
forgive me father,

293
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,120
and I'm on camera all the time.

294
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,240
I edit my own videos,

295
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,720
so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month

296
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,720
staring at my own face on a screen.

297
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,760
Now you try doing that

298
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,080
and see what kind of fucked up complex you develop.

299
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,280
Plus, I compare myself to other women who make videos.

300
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,520
A lot of the trans women on YouTube are so young,

301
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,400
and so beautiful,

302
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,920
it makes me wanna throw up.

303
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,800
And in comparison,

304
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,680
for a long time,

305
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,160
I've felt like this shabby,

306
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,680
aging transvestite.

307
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,600
Just this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store.

308
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,640
So I'm insecure,

309
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,560
I'm compensating for that whole mess,

310
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,200
but I honestly don't resent the beautiful people,

311
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,520
I really just stand the hell out of them.

312
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,880
I follow this woman on YouTube,

313
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,480
but I wanna be just like her mom.

314
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,960
Her name is Dame Jefferson Starr.

315
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,560
Her name is Lady Jane McLean.

316
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,120
Senora Nicole Beatrice Tutorials.

317
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,440
Tatyana Petrovna West-Rykova.

318
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,120
And of course my queen and perfect goddess,

319
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,840
whomst I stan,

320
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,840
and whose portrait I've painted hundreds of times.

321
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,920
So there's maybe some extra intensity for me,

322
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,600
but I think it's actually pretty normal

323
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,720
to wanna be beautiful.

324
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,640
I think even grad students wanna be beautiful.

325
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,720
They just wanna do it in that Becky kind of way,

326
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,120
where you scoff at anything glam or artificial.

327
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,520
And it's not just women who care about beauty either.

328
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,240
I mean, gay men in LA have always been getting cosmetic surgery,

329
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,080
but now even the straights are doing it.

330
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,560
Incels are completely obsessed with the details,

331
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,400
the defects of their personal appearance.

332
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,160
And the ones who aren't completely black-pilled

333
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,920
are obsessed with plastic surgery.

334
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:30,200
The incel newspeak word for beauty is looks-maxing,

335
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,640
because of course they have to go about this

336
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,480
in the most heterosexual possible way.

337
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,800
It is imperative to implement a skin-max regimen

338
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:37,640
in order to maximize looks-money status

339
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,320
and secure access to females.

340
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,440
Oh my god, calm down.

341
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,960
Not every sentence out of your mouth

342
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,600
has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner.

343
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,880
Yes, they actually call skincare skin-maxing.

344
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,800
James Charles, I know you're having a hard month,

345
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,160
but I've got a business idea

346
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,920
to turn this thing around for you.

347
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,800
Here's the plan.

348
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,800
You're gonna create a new line of skincare products

349
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,960
called Chad Glow.

350
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,520
Bribe PewDiePie to send his fans to the promo video,

351
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,880
hi sister cells,

352
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,960
and send me a check in the mail, you're welcome.

353
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,480
If you read looks-max forums,

354
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,200
they're filled with discussions of brow ridge implants,

355
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,440
chin implants, mandible implants.

356
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:14,680
It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad

357
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:18,360
exhibiteth a jawbone most robust.

358
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,320
It's literally facial masculinization surgery.

359
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,480
So everyone's obsessed with the bones,

360
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,000
everyone's obsessed with beauty,

361
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:29,080
whether man or woman, cis or trans, gay or gamer.

362
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,400
Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin',

363
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,480
while everyone else has completely lost their minds.

364
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,360
But why?

365
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,960
Why do we care so much?

366
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,880
Well with incels, by their own account,

367
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,920
the only reason they care is they think that looks-maxing

368
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,840
will make femoids have sex with them,

369
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,640
and they think that will make their lives feel meaningful,

370
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,200
which it will not.

371
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,880
So incels are canceled.

372
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,760
Now what about women?

373
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,400
What's our deal?

374
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,200
What's our sitch?

375
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:52,840
What's our vibe?

376
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,720
What's our vij?

377
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,680
Well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels,

378
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,920
that we care about beauty and wear makeup,

379
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,560
fake up,

380
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,400
because we're trying to attract men.

381
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,480
My daddy Dom went on Vice News last year

382
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,920
and said that women wear makeup

383
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,560
because they're trying to stimulate male sexual arousal

384
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,000
and because evolution.

385
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,440
Now with the risk of being bratty,

386
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,360
I gotta say this is maybe 10% true and 90% false.

387
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,840
For one thing, straight men don't like makeup.

388
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,040
At least they don't think they do.

389
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,600
Here's a chart I made illustrating what every straight man

390
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,280
in the world thinks about makeup.

391
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,800
Yes, I asked all of them.

392
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,440
If you wear no makeup, they think you look diseased.

393
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,640
And I actually do look diseased

394
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,240
when I don't wear makeup so fair enough.

395
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,840
If you wear natural makeup, you know,

396
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,720
a little concealer, mascara, maybe a nude lip,

397
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,040
they think you're not wearing any makeup and they like it.

398
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,280
If you wear campy makeup, colorful eyeshadow,

399
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,200
heavy contouring, overdrawn lips,

400
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,800
they think it's dumb and they hate it.

401
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,480
Of course I'm generalizing.

402
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,320
Hashtag not all daddy doms.

403
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,800
But if women really wore makeup to attract men,

404
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,800
then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing it

405
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,520
when there are no men.

406
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,360
But that doesn't happen.

407
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,680
About a month ago, there was that video going around

408
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,920
of a woman showing how to make jailhouse makeup,

409
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,720
mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow,

410
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,200
using Kool-Aid and Vaseline to make lipstick.

411
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,360
There's not a lot of men in women's prison,

412
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
but women are still performing incredible feats

413
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,400
of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup.

414
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,320
So maybe women are using makeup

415
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,120
to express their individuality and femininity,

416
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,320
you know, things that prison tries to take away from you.

417
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,360
Kinda makes sense.

418
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,200
There's a Refinery29 documentary

419
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,720
about prison cosmetology and also sexual exploitation, yikes,

420
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:26,120
in which a former inmate describes how women would engage

421
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:29,400
in sexual bartering with male guards just to get makeup.

422
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,680
If a girl's performing sexual favors for an officer,

423
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,040
he would bring her in colored pencils, lip gloss,

424
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,000
things like that.

425
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
That's right, women are sucking dicks

426
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,640
that they can put on makeup, not the other way around.

427
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,360
Honestly, if all the men died tomorrow, F,

428
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,200
I'd definitely keep wearing makeup.

429
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,320
In fact, I might wear more.

430
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,280
And I'm not just saying that

431
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,040
because I'm trying to win feminist poise,

432
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:50,760
or anything.

433
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,600
Like, do I want to attract men?

434
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,960
Yes, of course I do.

435
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,080
Do I want to attract women?

436
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:56,360
I guess.

437
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,120
I don't really think about it.

438
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,240
Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them

439
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,680
while quietly dying inside?

440
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,840
Whatever, it's fine.

441
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,160
I want to attract non-binary people too, of course,

442
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,480
but right now you guys are kind of getting in the way

443
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:12,200
of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender,

444
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,880
so how dare you?

445
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,800
The point is, when I think about my appearance,

446
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,640
wanting to attract people to have sex with

447
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,720
is not the main thing going through my head.

448
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,000
What is going through my head?

449
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,240
I guess I just want to feel beautiful,

450
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,680
I want to see myself in the mirror

451
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,760
and think I look snatched, is that a crime?

452
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,360
I don't feel pretty very often.

453
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,280
I'd say it happens about once a month

454
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,800
when I'm having a good skin day,

455
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,320
I do my makeup just right,

456
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,160
I glisten with setting spray,

457
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,000
and then it happens.

458
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,680
A tingle goes up my spine.

459
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,760
I am Botticelli.

460
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,920
I am Van Gogh.

461
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,920
I have created beauty, I'm a girl.

462
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,960
And then it's over, that's it for a month.

463
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,040
Usually when I look in the mirror,

464
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,140
I can't actually tell whether I'm pretty or not.

465
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,820
Like with other people, I can just look at them

466
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,740
and instantly make a judgment about it,

467
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,380
but with myself, I have to just guess.

468
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,820
It's the same as being a trans person

469
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,260
trying to figure out whether you pass.

470
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,100
Would you clock me?

471
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,160
I'd clock me.

472
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
I'd fuck me too, I don't give a shit.

473
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,540
Get out of my room, mom!

474
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:19,800
It doesn't work like that for me.

475
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,960
I have to rely on other people's feedback.

476
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,160
Of course, the problem with other people's feedback

477
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,500
is that people are liars.

478
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,760
You look great, hon.

479
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,300
Especially when those people are your fans.

480
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,860
Boots the house queen, stuff in my throat,

481
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,180
mother, I'll die for you.

482
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,060
Oh my God.

483
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,300
Or when they're your haters.

484
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,300
Your disgusting giant collarbone

485
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,380
outs you as a man at a thousand paces.

486
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,300
I guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty or not.

487
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,340
But I can estimate, like I have figured out

488
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,040
that I'm too pretty for Twitter,

489
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,160
but I'm not sure yet if I'm pretty enough for Instagram.

490
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,500
It's hard being a six.

491
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,800
I have been dipping my toes in the Instagram water.

492
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,220
Before my surgery, I got into a pretty good rhythm

493
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:59,260
of posting my shitty little makeup looks,

494
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,980
and what I find addictive about it

495
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:03,480
is this constant flow of positive comments

496
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,500
from other people, even though I know it's mostly flattery.

497
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,500
You invented beauty, perfect angel, choke me, mommy.

498
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,920
Every time I get a comment like that,

499
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,480
I'm perfectly aware that it's wild exaggeration

500
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,500
fueled by parasocial delusions,

501
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,040
but I still get a hit of dopamine in my biologically-fueled,

502
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,080
female brain.

503
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,080
And the intoxicating thing about Instagram

504
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,100
is that the embellishment of the truth is a two-way street,

505
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:26,220
thanks to the miracle of Facetune.

506
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:28,500
Yes, we finally get to talk about the phones.

507
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,720
See, it's a black mirror because it's a window

508
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,780
into the darkness of the human soul.

509
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,620
Get it?

510
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,800
Should I explain it again?

511
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,760
Phones live in a society.

512
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,580
Facetune is an app that lets you fix

513
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,080
all the problems with your face.

514
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,840
So here's an unedited pre-FFS picture of me.

515
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,420
What I would do in Facetune is smooth out the complexion,

516
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,960
shrink the nose a little, bring the jaw in,

517
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,640
and use the vibrance tool to make the eyeshadow pop.

518
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,000
It's really no more drastic

519
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200
than the kinds of photo doctoring people have been doing

520
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,900
since the invention of photography.

521
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,360
What's changed is that now everyone is doing it

522
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,540
to their own photos every day.

523
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,420
And I've noticed that when I'm in the habit

524
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,660
of editing my flaws out of pictures,

525
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,980
when I look at an unedited picture of myself,

526
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,500
or when I look in the mirror,

527
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,380
my eyes go straight to the flaws.

528
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:13,680
Why are my pores so big?

529
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:17,120
Why aren't medical scientists doing something to stop this?

530
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,640
Is this really a good use of my mental energy?

531
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,080
Here comes that guilt again.

532
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,660
Instead of worrying about my pores,

533
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:24,300
shouldn't I be helping stop

534
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,980
the impending climate catastrophe

535
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,400
that's gonna destroy the planet

536
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,880
if we don't change the economy in like 12 years?

537
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,520
Shit, I guess it's 11 years now.

538
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,240
It's just hard to focus on climate change

539
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,980
when there's so much else on my mind.

540
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,100
He's just so cute.

541
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,420
I guess I'd just rather think about the aesthetic

542
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,780
than the apocalypse.

543
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,840
And that's the darkness.

544
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,740
Why is my neck like two decades older

545
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,820
than the rest of my skin?

546
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,500
Do I need Botox yet?

547
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,860
Should I get a facelift?

548
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,440
These are the questions that will no doubt

549
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,580
define the next couple decades of my life.

550
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,520
As if it wasn't bad enough to have to go

551
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,840
through a second adolescence on camera,

552
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,700
I also have to deal with aging,

553
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,400
and thus the ritual of skincare products.

554
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,900
Here's my daytime routine.

555
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:11,900
So first, I'm gonna mix the Dermalogica exfoliator

556
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,020
with the cleansing gel and just massage my face.

557
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,560
None of this is sponsored, by the way.

558
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:18,460
This is just me supporting corporations

559
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,100
out of the kindness of my heart.

560
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,660
Now, if I'm not running late for something,

561
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,160
I will do a face mask.

562
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,200
But if I'm out of bed,

563
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,980
it's because I'm running late for something.

564
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:32,440
So I've never done a face mask.

565
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,300
Now, I'm gonna use a toner, which is very important.

566
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,660
Now, a lot of people don't know what a toner does,

567
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,660
but look, it tones okay.

568
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,820
Do you want your face to be untoned?

569
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,680
Next, I'm gonna spray

570
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:48,700
the expensive Korean yeast directly into my eyes.

571
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,200
I use this because it's actually a lot cheaper

572
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,700
than the Japanese yeast,

573
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,860
so you're really losing money if you don't buy it.

574
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,060
Think of the savings.

575
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,960
Now, I'm gonna mix a pump of hyaluronic acid

576
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:02,300
with a couple spritzes of organic Bulgarian rose water.

577
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,140
You can almost smell the Bulgarian rose fields.

578
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:05,980
It's enchanting.

579
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,820
It's like I'm there.

580
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,320
There's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather.

581
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,840
I use this moisturizer because Gigi Gorgeous told me to,

582
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,320
and I do everything Gigi says.

583
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,520
Every fucking thing.

584
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,460
I know it seems like a lot of products,

585
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:21,120
but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection,

586
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,360
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.

587
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,040
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

588
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,440
A sunscreen.

589
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,440
I'm not really sure what this does.

590
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,460
We can probably skip it.

591
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:31,040
And I'm just gonna finish it all off

592
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,960
with some more expensive mist.

593
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,500
Yes, God.

594
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,560
I love a good facial.

595
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm so fucking wet right now.

596
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,340
So after all these products,

597
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,920
does my skin look clearer, younger, more toned?

598
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,520
Well, it's hard to say, but I think it does.

599
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,760
I would say for sure, but it certainly is moist.

600
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,280
This is the part where I usually just stare at my own face

601
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,480
for 10 minutes and contemplate the futility

602
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,080
of my struggle against the ravages of time.

603
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,520
I'm fine.

604
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,700
It's fine.

605
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,460
This is fine.

606
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,300
It's fine.

607
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:20,520
So, isn't beauty supposed to be fun?

608
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,100
I'm not having fun right now.

609
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,960
Why am I not having fun?

610
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,340
I guess I just don't feel beautiful.

611
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:45,220
And I know a lot of people think I'm pretty,

612
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:47,540
and I know a lot of other people have it worse than me,

613
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:49,120
and I know I should be grateful,

614
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,080
and I know I'm privileged to be able to get plastic surgery,

615
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,320
and I know I shouldn't care so much about this

616
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,340
in the first place.

617
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:59,040
But the truth is that this just eats away at me,

618
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,480
and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain.

619
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,820
I've been kind of depressed this past month,

620
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:07,960
and I think part of it is that on a subconscious level,

621
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,580
I think I was hoping that surgery would completely

622
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,440
change my self-image and make me like myself.

623
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,020
But it really hasn't.

624
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,860
I'm not sure.

625
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,860
I mean, I'm happy with the results,

626
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,340
I'd do it all again,

627
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:21,180
but I still feel the way I felt before.

628
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,400
You have to keep in mind that surgery fixes

629
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,380
very specific problems,

630
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,960
like the Adam's apple problem,

631
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,500
or the way my forehead looks in profile problem.

632
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,920
But it's really not a solution to deep psychological issues.

633
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,980
I still don't feel beautiful,

634
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,520
and I need to face the fact that I'm never going

635
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,240
to feel beautiful unless I change the way I think.

636
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,640
Because I'm trapped in a doom spiral over here,

637
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,740
and if I'm ever gonna get out,

638
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,780
I think I need to start by forgiving myself

639
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,600
for wanting to be beautiful.

640
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,760
There's lots of reasons to wanna be beautiful

641
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,960
besides being shallow and vain.

642
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,740
For one, beauty is associated with youth,

643
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,520
it's a symbol of life, of defiance, of death.

644
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,280
That's a profound thing to be concerned about.

645
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,840
See, I'm not a bimbo, I'm a poet.

646
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,540
Beauty is also associated with moral worth,

647
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:10,140
the beautiful princess versus the evil hag.

648
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,240
There's studies showing that conventionally attractive

649
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,720
people are more likely to be assumed to be happy, healthy,

650
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:17,540
healthy, and trustworthy, they're more likely to be hired.

651
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,440
So it's not just about Instagram likes,

652
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,900
this is serious stuff.

653
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,500
And we, the woke, we are all aware of this.

654
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,940
We know that beauty is power, that beauty is political.

655
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,280
We know that beauty standards come from the people

656
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:31,460
with privilege in an unequal society.

657
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,240
We know it's unjust that being light-skinned, cis,

658
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,100
able-bodied, or thin is considered more attractive

659
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,080
than being dark-skinned, trans, disabled, or fat.

660
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,100
We know that female beauty matters so much

661
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,340
because it's patriarchy.

662
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,960
We know that our obsession with beauty is being provoked

663
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,120
by advertising, the cosmetic industry,

664
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,060
and beauty influencers who are trying to sell us products.

665
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,860
We know, we know, we know all this

666
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,480
because we've all been sitting around

667
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,320
critiquing it for decades.

668
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,220
Because that's what leftists do, we critique things.

669
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:03,300
We are finely-tuned detectors of racism, sexism,

670
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:07,220
ableism, fatphobia, transphobia, and capitalism-run AMAC.

671
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:09,880
We notice an injustice, we problematize it,

672
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,780
we critique it, and then we cancel it.

673
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,340
But what's next?

674
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,120
When we're done critiquing things,

675
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,440
what are we supposed to do?

676
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,080
Because I'm aware that conventional beauty standards

677
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:22,300
are a racist, sexist, ableist, fatphobic,

678
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,860
transphobic social construct designed to preserve

679
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:26,780
power relations and sell products,

680
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:29,620
but does that awareness mean I desire any less

681
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:31,220
to be conventionally beautiful?

682
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:33,040
Well, no.

683
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,340
I want it more than ever.

684
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,740
The problem is that the intellectual exercise

685
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,460
of critiquing things doesn't usually affect

686
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:41,620
my desires very much.

687
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,160
So what am I supposed to do?

688
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,960
Sit here in silent contemplation

689
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,040
until my desires finally align themselves

690
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:50,200
with the interests of the international proletarian revolution?

691
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,920
Oh, fuck the revolution.

692
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,460
I want to be a pretty rich girl.

693
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,140
I don't want to be ContraPoints anymore.

694
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,840
I want to be Gigi Gorgeous.

695
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,520
Fighting fascists on YouTube was an idea I came up with

696
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,560
when I was a male alcoholic.

697
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,820
Unfortunately, America needs a ContraPoints right now

698
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,440
more than it needs a 30-year-old Gigi Gorgeous impersonator,

699
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,200
so I guess I'm stuck with it.

700
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Maybe it's for the best.

701
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,040
Critiquing society may not change our desires,

702
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,760
but it can motivate us to change society.

703
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,620
And changing society can change our desires.

704
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,460
So how do we change society?

705
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,580
Revolution.

706
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,160
Well, sure, revolution.

707
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,900
Depending on what happens in 2020,

708
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,000
I'll think of grabbing a brick myself.

709
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,800
But failing that, I think there are ways we can work

710
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:33,360
to loosen the grip of restrictive beauty standards

711
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,500
without the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.

712
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,400
I do think representation matters,

713
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,420
and I think having visible beauty icons

714
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:43,040
who are dark-skinned or trans or gender nonconforming

715
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:47,200
or disabled or fat or over 35 or influencers

716
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,540
makes a big difference.

717
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,420
Beauty standards are social constructs,

718
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,560
and social constructs can change.

719
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,600
That's why it's so important to recognize

720
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,220
that influencers are just as valid as other celebrities.

721
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,820
But the problem with changing society

722
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,320
is that it takes a long time,

723
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,160
and this video is almost over.

724
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:06,420
Where I can see an escape from my particular doom spiral

725
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,940
is in style as an alternative ideal to beauty.

726
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,860
You can be stylish at any age, you can be stylish

727
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,240
whether you pass or not.

728
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,360
Style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic

729
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,220
that you have complete control over.

730
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:22,620
It's like art in that originality is a virtue.

731
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,080
Style is an individual aesthetic,

732
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,220
unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards.

733
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:31,200
As the poet Wordsworth said about artistic appreciation,

734
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,240
"'Every author, as far as he is great

735
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,080
"'and at the same time original,

736
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,800
"'has had the task of creating the taste

737
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
"'by which he is to be enjoyed.'"

738
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,000
So even if you don't conform

739
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,680
to conventional beauty standards,

740
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,920
through the power of original style,

741
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,860
you can create the taste

742
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,440
by which your unique beauty is to be appreciated.

743
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,480
Society may frown upon us six-foot trannies,

744
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,640
but if I know I'm dressed well or my makeup is snatched,

745
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,000
I can easily abide any comment, any stare.

746
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,300
I can be misgendered a Dairy Queen for all I care.

747
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,920
It does not matter.

748
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,480
I can strut with confidence

749
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,300
because I am basking in the regal knowledge

750
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,920
of my own aesthetic superiority.

751
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,220
Bow before me, peasants!

752
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,220
I proclaim to the drive-through window,

753
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,220
for I am serving a lurk.

754
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Sir, this is a Dairy Queen.

755
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,220
So, I guess that's the solution.

756
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:26,220
I can't believe I single-handedly ended capitalism.

757
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,220
Now, does that mean I'm not gonna get

758
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,220
a lot of expensive plastic surgery?

759
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,220
Fuck no!

760
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,220
What do you people think I am,

761
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:34,220
some kind of transgender Mother Teresa?

762
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,220
Goddamn.

763
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
The audacity of you people.

764
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,220
The hubris.

765
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
Look, I need plastic surgery because I have no style.

766
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
In fact, after the month of surgery,

767
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
you should be grateful I'm wearing clothes at all.

768
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,220
So, that's it for me.

769
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,220
I guess I have nothing but the decay of time and age

770
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,220
to look forward to.

771
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,220
I guess I'll just have to find my self-worth

772
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:52,220
in cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty.

773
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,220
Ew.

774
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,220
Gross.

775
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:41,220


776
00:29:41,220 --> 00:30:11,220


777
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:41,220


778
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:48,220
I'm drooling all over myself

779
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,220
because my jaw is still numb from the surgery.

780
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,220
Love that.
