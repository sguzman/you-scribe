1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
9-1-1, what are you reporting?

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,000
Uh, there's someone or some kind of creature prancing around out here.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Okay, is it a person, an animal, or...

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I can't tell. It looks like a woman, but she's about six foot tall, big man hands.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm sorry, you're calling to report a tall woman with man hands?

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Well, she's covered in butterflies, and she has giant wings.

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
I'm sorry, what?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Oh, and she talks like a .

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Ma'am...

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Out of this wood do not desire to go.

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And I will purge thy mortal grossness so that thou shalt like an airy spirit go.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Hail, mortals! I come to thee from my fairy grove to bring thee tidings of great woe.

14
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Western culture is being destroyed. By cocks.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
And by gender-bending, intoxication, and sodomy.

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
You know, things that have never happened in Europe.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
There's a lot of people talking lately about the West.

18
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
And Western culture. And Western civilization.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
But what do those words even mean?

20
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I guess the mature and responsible thing to do would be a simple educational video to edify the public.

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Fuck that!

22
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
The people demand blood. And I'm thirsty for blood.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And by blood, I mean dick.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
And by dick, I mean corn dogs.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And by corn dogs, I mean 16 of them over the course of an evening.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
And by evening, I mean morning.

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
And by morning, I mean between 8 o'clock and 8.15.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
And by corn dogs...

29
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Who's up first?

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Well, angry white guy YouTube is usually talking about Western culture,

31
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
and it's been a while since I've done a video response, so...

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Let's see what's going on in that part of the internet.

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
McGog is here, baby dog.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
What?

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't wanna die!

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That... is a man!

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wow, I've never done a video response to such a powerful wizard.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,000
The second and third clues are Elsa's magical powers and the song Let It Go.

39
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Both of these clues have to do with coming out.

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Wrong!

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Her magic power is the conflict of the plot.

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And her letting it go is just her realizing her true potential.

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
And her ability to conquer and rule her kingdom.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
She will destroy her enemies and raze their castles to the ground.

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The song Let It Go is basically,

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Fuck this shit! I'm conquering everyone!

47
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:07,000
So, just to be clear, this is a grown man who has dressed himself in the garb of a sorcerer

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,000
to shout about a YouTube channel for preschoolers.

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It almost feels like punching down at this point.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
At least the golden one was mask for mask.

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Who can I punch up at?

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't like talking about punching.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It makes me feel like one of those people who talks about punching turfs.

54
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I would never punch a turf.

55
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
My hands are too feminine.

56
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
And my fingers are tired.

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Someone massage them.

58
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Who can I claw up at?

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The fundamental assumptions of Western civilization are valid.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
How about that?

61
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Dad, stop! Ugh, get out of my life!

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:47,000
In my video about Jordan Peterson, I talked about how he posits a struggle between the West and postmodern neo-Marxism.

63
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I argued that pomo-nomo is a label that includes a bunch of incompatible ideas,

64
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
none of which are in any sense non-Western.

65
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Unless, of course, you equate the West with white people,

66
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and Marxism with the Jews,

67
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
which, surely, no one involved in this conversation is doing, right?

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm guessing he wasn't a fan of the bath scene.

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
In this video, I want to look a little bit closer at the whole concept of the West,

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
and the people who claim to defend it.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Wow, Daddy, nice... sword.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Goddammit, we're gonna need to aim even higher.

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ladies, gentlemen, and beyond, I give you...

74
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The President of the United States of America.

75
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Big Dick Special Big Boy Donald Trump.

76
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Just as Poland could not be broken, I declare today for the world to hear that

77
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
the West will never, ever be broken.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Our values will prevail, our people will thrive,

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
and our civilization will triumph.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
So we've got the most powerful fuckboy on the planet

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
prattling on about the battle for the survival of Western civilization.

82
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
So I suppose we should probably figure out what that's supposed to mean.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Which is too bad, because that's gonna require a lot of thinking.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
And I don't feel like thinking, because my brain is tired.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Someone massage it.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And soon, mechanically,

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
dispirited after a dreary day with the prospect of a depressing morrow,

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I raised to my lips a spoonful of the tea,

89
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
in which I had soaked a morsel of the corn dog.

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
No sooner had the warm liquid mixed with the dog touched my palate,

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
than a shudder ran through me, and I stopped,

92
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
intent upon the extraordinary thing that was happening to me.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
An exquisite pleasure had invaded my senses,

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,000
something isolated, detached, with no suggestion of its origin.

95
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And at once the vicissitudes of life had become indifferent to me,

96
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
its disasters innocuous, its brevity illusory,

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
this new sensation having had on me the effect which love has,

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
of post-preambulatory banter.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Whether you're in fashy YouTube, or pomo, nomo, akedomono,

100
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
it's common to take for granted that there is a historically continuous,

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
clearly defined thing called Western civilization,

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
that starts in ancient Athens and flourishes in our own era of enlightened philosopher kings.

103
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
But this is really just a story constructed retrospectively by modern people,

104
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
for particular purposes.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's like an origin myth.

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
In an article titled, There is no such thing as Western civilization,

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah points out that for the ancient Greek historian Herodotus,

108
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
there was no such thing as the West.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The world was divided into three continents he called Europe, Asia, and Libya.

110
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Herodotus had no notion that these three continents corresponded to different types of people,

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
and he never referred to any group of people called Europeans.

112
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
In fact, he was much more familiar with Egypt and Persia, in which he traveled,

113
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
than with the faraway and foreign people of Northern Europe.

114
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So the idea of the West has to be more recent than that.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Really, there is no one idea of the West,

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
which is an umbrella term that includes a lot of discontinuous cultures and contradictory ideas.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
According to me, there are six different concepts often invoked under the heading of the West.

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's talk about them now!

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Concept 1. Christendom and Judeo-Christian Values

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
In the year 732,

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,000
a soldier named Charles Martel led Frankish forces to victory at the Battle of Tours

122
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
against the Islamic forces that had advanced from Spain into what is now France,

123
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
effectively halting the spread of the Umayyad Caliphate into Western Europe.

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
According to Appiah, the first recorded use of the Latin term Europenses, or Europeans,

125
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
dates from 754 and describes the victors of the Battle of Tours, distinguishing Christians from Muslims.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
In the late Middle Ages, the concept of Christendom appeared,

127
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and was used to distinguish the Christian world from the Islamic world and from paganism.

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
This idea of Christendom is arguably the earliest precursor to the modern concept of the West.

129
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Notice that the term itself posits an us-versus-them dichotomy,

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
where Christians are the us and Muslims are the them.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Christian inheritance is still invoked today by defenders of the West

132
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
like Lil Benny and Professor Study the Blade, often under the heading of

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Judeo-Christian Values.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
A term usually used to falsely imply that contemporary moral norms

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
derive from such a generic, parochial, and incomplete document as the Ten Commandments,

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
as if every major civilization didn't have laws against murder,

137
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
as if the prohibition of graven images has any contemporary influence whatsoever,

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:43,000
as if it isn't an embarrassment that there are four laws protecting Snowflake Yahweh's easily triggered ego

139
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
and none condemning slavery and rape.

140
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And what if I like it when my neighbor covets my ass?

141
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Bible jokes.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Another main use of Judeo-Christian values is as a bludgeon against single parents and the queers.

143
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Speaking of which, what exactly are the family values we inherit from Christendom?

144
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Two kids and a dog, just like the Bible says?

145
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Well, no.

146
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Polygyny is specifically acknowledged in the Old Testament and not forbidden in either testament.

147
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Even in the beginning, Eve couldn't keep her hands away from strange serpents,

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,000
and who can blame her, and Joseph was a massive cock who raised another man's child.

149
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But it's cool, he was into that.

150
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
In the Middle Ages, the Catholic Church gradually enforced the one-man-and-one-woman view of marriage.

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Although in formerly pagan lands, this idea was slow to take hold.

152
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Charles Martel's grandson Charlemagne had 18 kids by at least 10 wives and concubines

153
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,000
because he was a proud son of the North, 100% natty, and alpha as fuck.

154
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I'm sorry, I just can't stop.

155
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
The Golden One, his soul and mine are intermingled.

156
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Probably because we both played 1200 Hours of Age of Empires in 1990.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
And then something went terribly wrong.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Fucking 9-11.

159
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It used to be such an innocent decision choosing to play as the Franks or the Saracens

160
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
that it became this huge civilizational struggle,

161
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and that's why this guy is a fascist and I grew up to be a woman.

162
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Thanks a lot, Osama.

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Being transgender is so weird.

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Like, you have these childhood memories that are just totally discordant with your adult gender identity.

165
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Like, how do you even deal with that?

166
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Well, here's how.

167
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You bond with straight guys over your shared Age of Empires nostalgia,

168
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and then you fuck them.

169
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm not like other girls.

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Concept two, enlightenment values.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So in 1517, an annoying social justice warrior named Martin Luther

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
nails his list of whiny complaints to the door of the church in Wittenberg.

173
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
That kicks off a century or so of brutal violence between Catholics and Protestants.

174
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
That eventually chills out,

175
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
but then the 18th century rolls around and shit's just fucking crazy.

176
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
There are various fops and dandies and macaronis

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
getting wired out of their heads at coffee houses

178
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and babbling about enlightenment like the beatnik trash they are.

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Then, 300 years later, a bunch of drink-sodden fedora tippers

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
appointed themselves intellectual descendants of Voltaire

181
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
before sinking into sweeping sexual harassment allegations under the rug

182
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
and making 55 consecutive YouTube videos about how Anita Sarkeesian is destroying video games.

183
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
That's not what they were discussing at the Parisian salon.

184
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
This is all very embarrassing,

185
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
but still, some of these enlightenment values

186
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
science, liberty, skepticism about dogma,

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
these are basically good ideas,

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
and they're part of the amalgamation we call the West.

189
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
But it's important to keep in mind that these ideas are not Judeo-Christian.

190
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
In fact, they're specifically opposed to that way of thinking.

191
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
So the sum of what we now think of as the West

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
actually contains major contradictions,

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
because the history of the West is a history

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
of change and revolution.

195
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
So when a new movement comes along,

196
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
like, for instance, a bunch of buzzkill sad sacks

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
pointing out that actually our society is still pretty terrible

198
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
to women, people of color, and gender and sexual minorities,

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
it might not be the smartest thing to just dismiss it

200
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
as some kind of sinister postmodern neo-Marxist cuckoldry.

201
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It could be the next reformation

202
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,000
in a history marked by a series of reformations.

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
If there are any historians watching this,

204
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
please call it the SJW reformation.

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Think about the Protestant reformation.

206
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
At the time, that probably seemed like a civilizational threat

207
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
at the Holy Roman Empire, and it kinda was.

208
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But in retrospect, we see the reformation

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
as just as important a moment in Western culture

210
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
as the medieval period that preceded it.

211
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But today's counter-reformation,

212
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
made up of people like Orangey Smalls and Dr. Clean Your Room,

213
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
uh,

214
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
insist on pretending the current reformation

215
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
is some kind of alien threat.

216
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
And as for the counter-counter-reformation,

217
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
well,

218
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,000
that's what you pay a trashy Tran to do.

219
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The idea of the West has its roots in the medieval schism

220
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
between the Western Roman Catholic Church

221
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
and the Eastern Orthodox Church.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
But in its contemporary sense,

223
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
the idea of a Western culture didn't really exist

224
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
until the imperialist era of the late 19th and early 20th centuries,

225
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
when it was popularized in part by Oswald Spengler's 1918 book

226
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
The Decline of the West,

227
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
an important influence on Nazi ideology.

228
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
As long as people have been talking about Western culture,

229
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
they've been worried about its alleged decline and degeneration,

230
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
as I've discussed in several earlier videos

231
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
which I encourage you not to watch.

232
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
But the idea of Western culture

233
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
was influential well beyond the Third Reich.

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
At the height of European imperialism,

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
the idea of a superior high culture of the West

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
was a convenient excuse to plunder and exploit the mysterious Orient.

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And even though we've swept the more overtly supremacist rhetoric under the rug,

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,000
the idea of Western culture is still a foundational concept

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
in our schools and universities,

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
where you have to take courses like

241
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
History of Western Civilization or Western Literature,

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
which you didn't actually do any of the readings for

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
because you were too busy crouching in the bushes outside the dean's office

244
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
vomiting up a couple pints of Malibu.

245
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The consequence of this Western culture education

246
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
is that we now all have this sense

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
that we belong to a continuous civilization

248
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
whose crowning achievements are the Ten Commandments,

249
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Jesus fucking Christ,

250
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Romanian pederasts,

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
cathedrals,

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Mozart,

253
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
human rights,

254
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
science,

255
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
and iPhones.

256
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But the reality is,

257
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
this is an essentialist conglomeration

258
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
of a history that's much more non-linear than we often think.

259
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
We in the West claim to be the inheritors

260
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
of the ancient traditions of Aristotle and Abraham,

261
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
but the Islamic world is entitled to just the same claim.

262
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
St. Thomas Aquinas,

263
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
one of the most powerful Catholic sorcerers,

264
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
is largely responsible for introducing Aristotle to Christian universities,

265
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
but he never would have encountered Aristotle

266
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
in the first place

267
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
had not ancient Greek philosophy been translated and commentated

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
by Islamic scholars like Ibn Rushd.

269
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
So the origins of Western culture aren't really unique to us at all.

270
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
And the stuff that is unique is just a mess of contradictions.

271
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
On the one hand, you have Judeo-Christian values,

272
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
and on the other hand, you have degenerates like William Shakespeare,

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
who wrote plays for men to dress up as fairy queens and make out with each other.

274
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Which, for the record, is disgusting,

275
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and I condemn it,

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
and I'll have no part in it.

277
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Because if you didn't know,

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
in Shakespeare times,

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
boys in drag played female parts.

280
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I wish I had female parts.

281
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Working on it.

282
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Concept 4. The Free World

283
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
From 1941 to 1945,

284
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Franklin Roosevelt's vice president was Henry Wallace,

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
an agricultural scientist from Iowa

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
whom Democratic Party officials despised

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
for being what we'd now call a Democratic Socialist.

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Wallace later ran for president in 1948

289
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
as a third-party candidate on a platform of universal healthcare,

290
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
anti-segregation,

291
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
and opposition to the Cold War.

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
During the campaign,

293
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Wallace was widely mocked in the press

294
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
for his spiritualism,

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
his refusal to disavow the Communist Party's endorsement,

296
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
and what Time magazine called

297
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
his assault on the South,

298
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
that is, his, quote,

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
ostentatious ride through cities and towns

300
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
with his Negro secretary beside him,

301
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
for which he was pelted with tomatoes and eggs.

302
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The poor, naive Wallace commented,

303
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
There is something so unlovely about hate

304
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
when you see it distorting the human face.

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
We'll get used to it, buddy.

306
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
This is America.

307
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Am I lecturing someone from 1948

308
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
about how bigoted this country is?

309
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
This is fine.

310
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Wallace received only 2.4% of the popular vote

311
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
in the 1948 election,

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
and he's now best remembered for his 1942 speech titled

313
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The Century of the Common Man,

314
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
in which he contrasted what he called

315
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the slave world of fascists with the free world,

316
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
which he described as an incomplete

317
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
and ongoing international people's revolution.

318
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
No Nazi counterrevolution will stop.

319
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,000
The common man will smoke the Hitler stooges

320
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
out into the open in the United States,

321
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
in Latin America, and in India.

322
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
He will destroy their influence.

323
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
No Lavalls, no Mussolinis

324
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
will be tolerated in a free world.

325
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Wallace had an especially left-wing take on it,

326
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
but it was common during World War II,

327
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
when the phrase the free world

328
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
first entered common parlance,

329
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
to include all the countries opposing the Axis powers,

330
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
including the Dirty Reds.

331
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
After the war, the phrase the free world

332
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
remained common in American politics,

333
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
but the meaning shifted.

334
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Instead of referring to the international alliance

335
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
against fascism, it referred to the capitalist West,

336
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
as opposed to the communist East.

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
The idea of the free capitalist West

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
is still an important ingredient

339
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
in this jumbled concept we call Western Civilization.

340
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
So when Lobster Dad says there's a struggle

341
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
between Marxism and the West,

342
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
it seems at first like he's just stuck in the 1980s or something.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Doesn't he know there's no more Eastern Bloc?

344
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Dad, what year do you think it is?

345
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Are you at war in your head with the goddamn Ruskies?

346
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
They're on your side now, remember?

347
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
The truth is, he's just using the term neo-Marxism

348
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
to invoke Red Scare sentiment

349
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
in opposition to the SJW Reformation.

350
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But the point I'm trying to make

351
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
is that the West is a concept,

352
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
or rather several contradictory concepts,

353
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
that are always posited in particular political circumstances

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
as one side of an us-versus-them opposition.

355
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Whether it's the Christian West versus the infidels,

356
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
the Enlightenment West versus Islam,

357
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
the cultured West versus the colonized savages,

358
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
the capitalist West versus the communist East,

359
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
or the white European West

360
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
versus the Jewish cultural Marxist plot

361
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
to cock the sons of the North

362
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
by besmirching the purity of their fair maidens

363
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
and inundating their countries

364
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
with a barbarous horde of third world migrants.

365
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I guess I have to say something about that.

366
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Concept five, blood and soil.

367
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
If you ask leading Nazi social media influencer

368
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Richard Spencer what he thinks the West is,

369
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
he'll tell you that it's a cultural, geographic,

370
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,000
and genetic inheritance bequeathed to European people

371
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
by their fair-skinned ancestors.

372
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
To Spencer, the idea that a person of Asian or African descent

373
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
could be part of the West is ridiculous

374
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
because for Spencer, to be Western is to be white.

375
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Now the thing about that is,

376
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
as an analysis of the common usage of the term

377
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
the West, it's not even wrong.

378
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Consider Latin America, where the main languages spoken

379
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
are Spanish, Portuguese, and French,

380
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
where the majority of religion is Roman Catholicism.

381
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Why is this region generally not regarded as part of the West?

382
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Why are immigrants from this region demonized as alien intruders?

383
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Well, because its people have too much melanin to join the club.

384
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Or to be more accurate, the flexible and historically variant

385
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
concepts of whiteness and the West

386
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
have been constructed so as to exclude them.

387
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
And I've already spent half my YouTube career

388
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
on delirious gay screeching about Nazis,

389
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
so I don't want to do more of that now.

390
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,000
But suffice to say, the association between whiteness and the West

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
is always lurking beneath the surface,

392
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
and when whiteness rears its head proudly,

393
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
the result is the ugliest crimes our civilization is capable of.

394
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
As I'm making this video, the machinery of the middle stages

395
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
of those crimes is up and running yet again,

396
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
thanks to a refugee crisis in Europe

397
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
and a racist demagogue in the United States,

398
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
and once more, both continents are dotted with barbed wire,

399
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,000
refugee ghettos, and internment camps full of children torn from parents.

400
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The West, in many ways, is an inherently supremacist concept.

401
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It's thought to be more civilized, more holy,

402
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
and more cultured than the non-West.

403
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But there are some ridiculous college professors

404
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,000
who adopt this story wholesale but flip it on its head.

405
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
According to them,

406
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
the West is not uniquely civilized,

407
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
but uniquely uncivilized,

408
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
cruel,

409
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
imperialistic,

410
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
racist,

411
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
and genocidal.

412
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
But this just perpetuates the same essentializing error.

413
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Europeans aren't inherently more evil

414
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
any more than they're inherently more civilized.

415
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
If capitalist imperialism had burst out of Africa 400 years ago,

416
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
the result would have been just as brutal.

417
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
So instead of vilifying the West,

418
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
I think we should get rid of the concept altogether,

419
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
adopt a more cosmopolitan understanding of ourselves,

420
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
and acknowledge that the world is too complicated

421
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
to reduce to simple us-and-them binaries.

422
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Which is not to say that we have to get rid of Aristotle

423
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
and classical music and the Cheesecake Factory.

424
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We can still keep all that shit

425
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
while eliminating the propaganda

426
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
and injustice that surrounds it.

427
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
My mind is a predator that preys upon itself.

428
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
What if traps are gay?

429
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What if no one can ever love you?

430
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
What if happiness is impossible?

431
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
What if everyone who compliments me is lying

432
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
so they can laugh at me later when I delusionally feel good about myself?

433
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
What if when you die you stay conscious and then you just are un-

434
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What if I'm standing in an awkward way and it looks weird?

435
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What if Blanchard is right?

436
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What are these horrible goddamn noises coming out of my mouth?

437
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Sometimes you just need a break from your own brain,

438
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
and music is really great for that.

439
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I've always liked classical music.

440
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
When I listen to Mozart or Mendelssohn

441
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
or even an amateur like Satie,

442
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
my mind is lifted to a higher plateau.

443
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And I don't care what civilization the composer came from

444
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
or whether he was a bigot or a sexist.

445
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
And I don't want to know.

446
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Because I need this.

447
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I need this feeling

448
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
that makes me just want to take a big

449
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
inside of my balls.

450
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I could have hit two at once.

451
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
What should I do?

452
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I don't want to die.

453
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm just gonna die.

454
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
So, okay, fine.

455
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
He has the head of an ass.

456
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
But there's certain advantages to that.

457
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
That's all I'm saying.
