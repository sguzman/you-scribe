hi i'm jackie jackson you're listening to the freedom pod where it doesn't matter

00:58.980 --> 00:59.620
what

00:59.620 --> 01:07.540
you say it only matters that you say we don't discriminate here between what is true or false

01:07.540 --> 01:13.380
or even downright dangerous that's none of my business it's none of america's business

01:13.380 --> 01:21.140
the important thing is that you never stop talking because that's what freedom is all about

01:21.860 --> 01:28.660

02:27.580 --> 02:27.620
the studio

02:27.620 --> 02:27.820
do we share so no reaction

02:27.820 --> 02:28.260
remember when you jak is~!

02:28.260 --> 02:28.660

02:28.660 --> 02:28.900
através of the lost holy water times like ought to stop producing gambling right now angels listen no fear

02:28.900 --> 02:34.280
Anarchy? What does that even mean? Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.

02:34.760 --> 02:40.320
The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with aimless

02:40.320 --> 02:46.200
fornication. They're tearing apart the social fabric and normal Americans are being silenced.

02:46.720 --> 02:54.080
That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel culture, PC, CRT, SJW, globo, homo, pomo, nomo.

02:54.080 --> 02:58.960
The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.

02:59.420 --> 03:04.500
And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in America,

03:05.220 --> 03:12.200
the Christian majority. Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little

03:12.200 --> 03:18.300
more specific? Of course, Jackie. Religious liberties are under attack. We're losing our

03:18.300 --> 03:23.820
right to teach biblical morality to children who are growing up in public schools run by

03:23.820 --> 03:24.060
socialists. We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children who are growing up

03:24.060 --> 03:29.900
social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender neutral bathrooms and drag

03:29.900 --> 03:35.740
queen story hour than teach young people about the wonder working power of the precious blood

03:35.740 --> 03:41.440
of the lamb. Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country. I'm sorry that you feel offended

03:41.440 --> 03:46.620
by it. Believe it or not, the founding fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever

03:46.620 --> 03:51.680
twisted necromancy these people think is Christianity. Jackie, these communists are

03:51.680 --> 03:53.680
polluting the innocence of children.

03:54.060 --> 03:59.500
And if you speak out against the grooming, they call you a bigot. Parents get no say anymore.

03:59.840 --> 04:05.900
They're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns about the deviant lifestyles promoted in

04:05.900 --> 04:10.840
schools. You know, one day your kids will come home and you won't even recognize them anymore.

04:11.240 --> 04:16.960
That's the real agenda here. Sexual indoctrination. This generation that's coming up,

04:16.960 --> 04:23.800
20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the remaining

04:23.800 --> 04:31.820
70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists, or worse,

04:32.460 --> 04:38.540
Episcopalians. No. No, I won't stand for that. I'm sorry, what does this have to do with drugs?

04:38.740 --> 04:45.360
Well, everything. Addiction and sexual brokenness. These are two heads of the same serpent,

04:45.360 --> 04:52.540
symptoms of the same cultural leprosy. Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers,

04:52.680 --> 04:53.680
childhood.

04:53.800 --> 04:59.420
Is anyone going to ask me what I think? Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen

04:59.420 --> 05:05.620
to the ramblings of a bigoted hate preacher? Well, God has nothing to do with hate. Christ is the

05:05.620 --> 05:10.660
definition of love. Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia. I'm talking about you. Justine,

05:10.660 --> 05:17.500
if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot? You liberals call everyone who disagrees

05:17.500 --> 05:23.540
with you a bigot. Exactly. Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once and have a calm,

05:23.800 --> 05:28.260
rational conversation with people who have different opinions?

05:28.260 --> 05:34.780
Okay, well, let's see how that goes. Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to

05:34.780 --> 05:41.160
set people free from sexual brokenness and protect the rights of children. Kids who are struggling

05:41.160 --> 05:46.660
with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative therapy that will make them

05:46.660 --> 05:53.580
whole again. Reparative therapy? You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?

05:53.800 --> 06:00.160
What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken and

06:00.160 --> 06:04.980
polluted and they need God to make them whole. You people are selling the cure to a sickness

06:04.980 --> 06:11.940
you created. Are you cancel-culturing me right now? Oh my god, she's totally cancel-culturing

06:11.940 --> 06:18.140
you right now. Are you thought-policing me? No, I'm trying to stop you from thought-policing

06:18.140 --> 06:22.280
everyone else. You're saying it should be a thought crime? You're saying that I am a thought

06:22.280 --> 06:23.780
criminal? Justine, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

06:23.780 --> 06:27.860
because I happen to believe in the traditional biblical definition of marriage

06:27.860 --> 06:29.940
between a man and a woman who form a covenant before God

06:29.940 --> 06:32.340
who gave his only begotten son to wash away the sins of the world

06:32.340 --> 06:34.180
when he died on the cross and was resurrected three days later,

06:34.240 --> 06:35.200
all glory to his name.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.000
Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.

06:39.380 --> 06:42.300
And I'm sure the blue check Twitter mob is already coming for me

06:42.300 --> 06:43.680
because you can't say anything anymore.

06:43.680 --> 06:48.040
And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.640
You know who's really being silenced?

06:51.840 --> 06:53.600
People who are silent.

06:54.540 --> 06:57.480
Being silent is a big part of being silenced.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.540
That's what being silenced means.

07:00.140 --> 07:01.840
So who's really being silenced?

07:02.280 --> 07:03.880
Not people on podcasts.

07:04.440 --> 07:08.560
Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history

07:08.560 --> 07:10.080
about how silenced they are.

07:10.080 --> 07:15.420
No, the people who are silenced are people we never hear from.

07:16.040 --> 07:18.860
Because, and I really can't emphasize this enough,

07:19.440 --> 07:21.100
they are silenced.

07:21.680 --> 07:22.720
People in prison.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.160
Queer teenagers in conservative towns.

07:25.480 --> 07:28.620
The actual downtrodden and oppressed people of this country.

07:28.940 --> 07:30.620
Not you, Miss America.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.220
Not you, Mother Superior.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.800
You're not silenced.

07:35.340 --> 07:37.840
You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.

07:38.380 --> 07:40.880
So you defend your right to say it.

07:41.260 --> 07:43.840
Okay, but if I'm not being silenced,

07:44.220 --> 07:46.800
then why can't I say the N-word?

07:47.060 --> 07:48.900
Why do you want to say the N-word?

07:48.900 --> 07:51.880
So I only have freedom of speech

07:51.880 --> 07:52.680
when I can,

07:52.880 --> 07:56.040
which conforms to your liberal ideology?

07:56.600 --> 07:58.200
God, damn it, Jackson.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.520
Um...

07:59.520 --> 08:02.820
That sounds a little bit like...

08:02.840 --> 08:04.880
Bein' silenced?

08:05.480 --> 08:07.040
She's stonewalling me.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.480
All over America today,

08:08.480 --> 08:11.240
white parents are having to sit their children down

08:11.240 --> 08:15.640
and explain that there's certain words they just can't say

08:15.960 --> 08:17.740
because of the color of their skin.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.600
Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.680
would be turned down.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.120
turning in his grave.

08:24.120 --> 08:24.960
Would he?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.740
I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave,

08:26.740 --> 08:28.100
but not for the reasons you think.

08:28.100 --> 08:30.200
Jackie, can I bring this back on topic

08:30.200 --> 08:32.000
and share the good news of the gospel?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.040
That's not the topic.

08:33.040 --> 08:35.380
I have prayed on this, and honestly,

08:35.380 --> 08:38.700
the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion

08:38.700 --> 08:42.040
for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.880
You know, when I look out at all these angry people

08:44.880 --> 08:49.120
at the pride parade, doing all this sexual acting out

08:49.120 --> 08:51.200
and wearing provocative clothing

08:51.200 --> 08:53.640
in a desperate bid for attention,

08:53.640 --> 08:55.840
I see the broken childhoods,

08:55.840 --> 08:58.880
and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging,

08:58.880 --> 09:00.300
and I feel for them.

09:00.300 --> 09:01.140
I really do.

09:01.140 --> 09:04.620
Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity

09:04.620 --> 09:06.760
on the poor, sad homos.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.760
You know, what you people really love

09:08.760 --> 09:11.740
is the aesthetic of being compassionate,

09:11.740 --> 09:13.900
but all you're really doing is calling into question

09:13.900 --> 09:16.040
the worthiness of other people's lives.

09:16.040 --> 09:19.500
Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live,

09:19.500 --> 09:20.660
you know?

09:20.660 --> 09:22.720
Whatever happened to love your neighbor?

09:22.720 --> 09:25.620
Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you

09:25.620 --> 09:29.100
that I'm the most compassionate person that they know,

09:29.100 --> 09:33.080
but love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.

09:33.080 --> 09:36.380
And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just bow down

09:36.380 --> 09:40.480
to the intimidation tactics of the secular ruling elite.

09:40.480 --> 09:43.260
It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions

09:43.260 --> 09:46.060
about this narrative we're all being force-fed

09:46.060 --> 09:48.260
that God and scripture have no place

09:48.260 --> 09:50.060
in American life anymore,

09:50.060 --> 09:56.060
that we're all supposed to submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats imposing their

09:56.060 --> 10:01.380
queer ideology which says that if your child comes home from school and announces she's

10:01.380 --> 10:06.820
a different gender this week, then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's

10:06.820 --> 10:07.820
knife.

10:07.820 --> 10:13.440
Slicing up tiny little children's bodies, that's where this is headed.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.120
The shrine of Moloch.

10:15.120 --> 10:20.040
Oh my god, no one is slicing up children's bodies, what are you talking about?

10:20.040 --> 10:21.540
You absolute lunatic.

10:21.540 --> 10:27.480
Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure, I feel I should

10:27.480 --> 10:33.800
let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.600
Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?

10:37.600 --> 10:40.960
Or should I say, Justin?

10:40.960 --> 10:43.600
Oh come on, really?

10:43.600 --> 10:46.960
Alright, we're doing this.

10:50.040 --> 11:03.100
Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?

11:03.100 --> 11:05.040
Is this a throwback to the 1970s?

11:05.040 --> 11:09.600
No, it's a throw forward to the 20 I don't give a fucks.

11:09.600 --> 11:15.100
Well, don't mind if I do.

11:15.100 --> 11:19.280
Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.040
Good Virginia tobacco.

11:20.040 --> 11:21.040
Jackie.

11:21.040 --> 11:24.800
The Freedom Podcast LLC does not endorse the sale or use of cigarettes, vaporizers or other

11:24.800 --> 11:27.660
nicotine products to individuals under 21 years of age.

11:27.660 --> 11:29.720
Some restrictions apply, results may vary.

11:29.720 --> 11:32.840
Excuse me, Jackie, I'm really not comfortable with this.

11:32.840 --> 11:39.380
I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today, and I really have nothing to say

11:39.380 --> 11:42.440
to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.

11:42.440 --> 11:47.480
Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we

11:47.480 --> 11:48.480
are.

11:48.480 --> 11:49.480
Virginia.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.040
Are you prepared to get splashed?

11:51.040 --> 11:57.160
Then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.660
Excuse me?

11:58.660 --> 12:02.660
I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.

12:02.660 --> 12:04.440
I'm a libertarian.

12:04.440 --> 12:06.360
Anything goes baby USA.

12:06.360 --> 12:13.160
Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.

12:13.160 --> 12:17.960
Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage, it would be a

12:17.960 --> 12:18.960
free for all.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.200
And now, here we are.

12:21.200 --> 12:24.580
96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.

12:24.580 --> 12:27.960
It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve.

12:27.960 --> 12:35.340
Not Adam and Eve, and Kai and Jaden, and Caden and Lilith and Ashton and Schuyler and Rainbow.

12:35.340 --> 12:38.480
Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism.

12:38.480 --> 12:44.040
And from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.

12:44.040 --> 12:45.760
And that's the real agenda here.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.960
These people want to lower the age of consent.

12:47.960 --> 12:48.960
And legally.

12:48.960 --> 12:53.560
They have socialized sodomy with all the beasts that walk the Earth and the birds

12:53.560 --> 12:56.220
of the sea and all the fishes of the sky.

12:56.220 --> 12:57.220
All of them?

12:57.220 --> 13:07.980
What do Ready Slide and Random

13:07.980 --> 13:09.520
Uh-huh.

13:09.520 --> 13:12.740
You know what I thought?

13:12.740 --> 13:13.860
Just...

13:13.860 --> 13:15.340
Prejudice.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.400
Still?

13:16.400 --> 13:17.400
None?

13:17.400 --> 13:18.400
None?

13:18.400 --> 13:23.480
super provocative super brave and super bold we're living in Orwell's nightmare but you're

13:23.480 --> 13:28.760
a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced amazing look I just think it's great that three

13:28.760 --> 13:34.380
people with differing opinions can all sit down in a room and have a respectful conversation

13:34.380 --> 13:40.540
well cheers to us is it great you know I don't think it's that great and I don't think there's

13:40.540 --> 13:45.720
anything respectful about the two of you sitting here interrogating the morality of queer people

13:45.720 --> 13:52.660
something you know absolutely nothing about oh I know more than you might think I used to be

13:52.660 --> 14:02.220
a homosexual you what no I'm not doing this today I'm sorry you used to be a homosexual that's right

14:02.220 --> 14:08.380
Jackie before I was saved here we go I used to be a lesbian that's who I thought I was I lived

14:08.380 --> 14:15.460
that lifestyle you used to be a lesbian okay name five things you love about men this should be

14:15.460 --> 14:15.700
good

14:15.700 --> 14:20.440
gather around everyone let's all witness the power of Christ I'm sure this will be very convincing

14:20.440 --> 14:28.140
I love the Lord who does not command me to be straight he commands me to be holy fear not

14:28.140 --> 14:36.240
you will no longer live in shame for your creator will be your husband okay well if you want to be

14:36.240 --> 14:41.320
the bride of Christ then by all means but you know keep it in the bedroom I'm tired of you

14:41.320 --> 14:45.440
people shoving your lifestyle in everyone's face Virginia I'm confused I thought people

14:45.440 --> 14:53.000
are just born that way like Jesus can't change that Jackie the mainstream media establishment

14:53.000 --> 14:58.780
doesn't want you to know that people like me exist because that goes against their narrative

14:58.780 --> 15:05.980
but recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories the ploy of the enemy is to make

15:05.980 --> 15:13.440
us feel that we cannot change but what if every addict said well I'm just a junkie that's who I am

15:13.440 --> 15:15.180
I sexually identify as a homosexual I'm just a junkie that's who I am I sexually identify as a

15:15.180 --> 15:24.980
alcoholic so Jesus can't change me well that's a good point uh no it isn't gay is just a feeling

15:24.980 --> 15:33.320
homosexual lust same-sex temptation that's a feeling not an identity like maybe you struggle

15:33.320 --> 15:38.880
with wrath but you don't identify as wrathful maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the

15:38.880 --> 15:45.020
face I want to punch you in the face and yet you haven't punched me lo and behold you have a

15:45.180 --> 15:52.560
desire without acting on the desire when I was saved I left behind the false identity I used to

15:52.560 --> 15:58.320
walk in and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love my old self has been

15:58.320 --> 16:05.280
crucified with Christ it is no longer I who lives but Christ lives in me but before I made God Lord

16:05.280 --> 16:14.160
of my desires I was controlled by sin by drugs by alcohol by homosexuality so you used to be cool

16:15.180 --> 16:22.560
wow behold the power of Christ you think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication yes I do

16:22.560 --> 16:28.920
it's pretty cool I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication is this a joke

16:28.920 --> 16:37.940
to you do you find this humorous yeah I don't because I have glimpsed the gates of hell

16:37.940 --> 16:44.380
where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin away from God shut out from grace

16:45.180 --> 16:48.360
tormented by unyielding guilt and shame

16:52.140 --> 16:59.340
yes we've all been to Cincinnati can we wrap this back around to the drug topic Virginia

16:59.340 --> 17:05.340
you're saying you used to be an addict that's right Jackie what were you addicted to Miracle

17:05.340 --> 17:14.280
Whip veggie tales uh communion wafers maybe no I was addicted to alcohol to pornography

17:15.180 --> 17:25.500
to lusting after women and to hype hype you Virginia lamb were a hype addict look Virginia

17:25.500 --> 17:33.000
can you drop a quick story time on this because I am intrigued Jackie I would love to testify you

17:33.000 --> 17:40.260
know growing up I never really felt connected to my mother girl not this when I left home I was lost

17:40.260 --> 17:44.880
I was a wretch I was on fire and I rebuked that fire

17:45.180 --> 17:53.700
I used foul language I went out clubbing I cut my hair off I gained weight I was tempted by same

17:53.700 --> 17:58.980
sex attraction and I struggled with gender confusion you know I was always a little more

17:58.980 --> 18:04.980
masculine I'd even started down the path toward transgendered I used to shoot up testosterone

18:04.980 --> 18:09.600
that's why my voice is a little lower yeah the two of you sound kind of the same honestly if

18:09.600 --> 18:14.700
I didn't know I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man neither of us is the man

18:15.180 --> 18:21.720
Lynn though if anything this one's the man she he's the one injecting testosterone God has healed

18:21.720 --> 18:30.480
the feminine within me all along God was tugging at my heart but for me the road to heaven led

18:30.480 --> 18:39.360
through hell I felt a terrible void inside I lived in the flesh I lived in sin with another

18:39.360 --> 18:44.940
woman hoping to satisfy that hunger here we go when I gazed upon her beauty I thought

18:45.180 --> 18:52.380
sunlight had broken through the clouds but the light I saw was nothing but the fire of my own

18:52.380 --> 19:03.300
wickedness I knew that lifestyle was wrong but I couldn't quit until she broke my heart and then

19:04.860 --> 19:09.600
I was cast into the outer darkness yeah she probably got tired of your

19:09.600 --> 19:12.540
Jesus it was like a part of me was ripped away

19:13.560 --> 19:15.000
and I was left to face

19:15.000 --> 19:21.560
brokenness alone what was she a capricorn no a sagittarius well there's your problem

19:22.280 --> 19:29.320
next time maybe try a water sign stop interrupting i'm living for the drama jackie i was alone

19:29.960 --> 19:39.240
i was suicidal i was an addict i was lost until one day i decided to go to church with my mom

19:40.200 --> 19:49.080
and i was surrounded by these women singing what can wash away my sin what can make me whole again

19:49.880 --> 20:00.200
nothing but the blood of jesus that washes white as snow and i felt this tingling all over my body

20:00.200 --> 20:07.800
and i knew i was hearing the voice of god for the very first time not just the words of the hymn

20:07.800 --> 20:09.160
but the voice of the father

20:09.800 --> 20:15.640
speaking directly to me yes we all like music and suddenly my pain made sense

20:16.440 --> 20:23.160
i don't have to live this way anymore in that moment i was transfigured by the holy spirit

20:23.160 --> 20:30.520
i was cleansed i was healed i was delivered i was sanctified i was redeemed my guilty

20:30.520 --> 20:38.840
stains were washed away and i exchanged my brokenness and pain for his loving grace okay so

20:39.960 --> 20:48.040
i'm confused do you eat dick now what's your deal jackie my deal is that i entered the throne room

20:48.040 --> 20:54.120
with a repentant heart and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the father when i found jesus

20:54.120 --> 21:02.040
i found someone who truly loves me and through obedience to him my identity is no longer in my

21:02.040 --> 21:09.000
attractions but in christ you know what i think virginia i think that you are immoderate in love

21:09.000 --> 21:14.760
and a moderate with substances and so you need an imaginary father figure to make all the rules

21:14.760 --> 21:20.200
because you can't control yourself but your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else should

21:20.200 --> 21:27.080
have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy mental infancy bondage to the flesh

21:27.080 --> 21:38.520
is mental infancy i know justin the chains of sin i know the murmuring complaints of the flesh the itch the ache the shame and ill秒

21:39.000 --> 21:46.060
I lived in mud. I lived in filth. I know the thorns, the seething cauldron, the great whirlwind

21:46.060 --> 21:52.760
that whips sinners round an endless wheel of pain. But my shame was hammered to the cross

21:52.760 --> 21:58.340
for those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

22:00.000 --> 22:08.420
Virginia, who are you trying to impress with this ostentatious sexual anorexia? Who is the

22:08.420 --> 22:14.120
beneficiary of your erotic constipation? God? I really don't think he cares, Gorge.

22:14.800 --> 22:20.940
Celibacy is not a good deed. To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say that you're gay

22:20.940 --> 22:25.660
and you hate yourself. I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.

22:25.960 --> 22:32.620
Is it hate to worship the glory of God over the glory of self? Where's my nail? Is it hate to be

22:32.620 --> 22:37.740
anchored to the Savior's will that leads me from temptation? Damn it. To walk with purpose,

22:38.100 --> 22:38.400
abide by God's will? Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

22:38.400 --> 22:45.260
Abiding in the identity of who God made me? Is it hate to heal the brokenness and be made whole

22:45.260 --> 22:50.920
through radical obedience to the Holy Spirit? Have you been made whole, Virginia? Because to me,

22:51.020 --> 22:56.420
it sounds like you amputate half of your own soul and you call it sin and shame. Well,

22:56.920 --> 23:03.100
that's my definition of sexual brokenness. Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrato?

23:03.320 --> 23:07.760
She's hilarious. She's a wit. We are all half angel and half beast.

23:07.760 --> 23:14.760
The flesh must die so the spirit may live. The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.

23:15.060 --> 23:21.920
Have you really wandered so far astray? Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of

23:21.920 --> 23:27.920
Sodom that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul? No, Virginia, that's not what I think.

23:28.420 --> 23:34.420
What I think is that you have a vulgar, cracker-barrel understanding of human sexuality

23:34.420 --> 23:37.420
and you're on a save-the-children type moral crusade.

23:37.760 --> 23:42.920
Because you lack the adult capacity to face the demons in your own head.

23:42.920 --> 23:49.480
You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation. Well, what even is that, Virginia?

23:50.240 --> 23:56.720
I want specifics. What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're gonna do if Jesus stops

23:56.720 --> 24:02.900
holding your hand for 10 minutes? What? You think you're gonna rail a line of hype off a stripper's

24:02.900 --> 24:07.740
tits? Excuse me? Answer this. What do you think erotic love is a design?

24:07.760 --> 24:19.740
For? Wait, I know this one. Sex. No, that's too easy. Erotic love is not aimless pleasure-seeking.

24:20.420 --> 24:29.060
It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness, to traverse the lonely void that

24:29.060 --> 24:37.280
separates us from each other, to liberate repressed energy, to feel alive. Love is not the flesh.

24:37.760 --> 24:43.880
It's not temptation. It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face. It's nothing like

24:43.880 --> 24:52.640
being an alcoholic. It's not a craving. It's a yearning. The desire for reunion with our other

24:52.640 --> 25:00.860
half, Aristophanes. But you people don't understand that. Because you are vulgarians. You

25:00.860 --> 25:06.020
have no sense of humanity. And you have no sense of the erotic. Well, that sounds like a bunch of

25:06.020 --> 25:06.500
liberal,

25:06.500 --> 25:07.200
liberal,

25:07.200 --> 25:07.700
liberal,

25:07.700 --> 25:08.840
sexist bullcrap.

25:08.840 --> 25:16.460
Jackie, your brain is so small. It's just so tiny. Look at me.

25:17.180 --> 25:21.320
You're a dum-dum. Okay? And I'm gonna need you to stop talking.

25:21.320 --> 25:27.180
As usual, the cancel culture woke stoppo is trying to silence me.

25:27.180 --> 25:33.800
Shh, Jackie. I really am trying to silence you this time. Because you're so stupid. And I can't

25:33.800 --> 25:35.660
stand it anymore. So shut up.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.140
I'm giving you the bullshit.

25:37.140 --> 25:44.900
giving you the plague liberal okay well i hope it kills me because i'm done see i'll never get sick

25:44.900 --> 25:51.300
because every day i drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication doctors don't want you to

25:51.300 --> 25:57.300
know about it i could not possibly be more done you may be done but i'm not well you people never

25:57.300 --> 26:04.100
are are you you want to talk about yearning i mean i get it i used to live in shame i know the

26:04.100 --> 26:09.620
insatiable longing to be with another woman yes we've all noticed let me tell you it is not

26:09.620 --> 26:17.940
freedom it is bondage you do not possess the flesh justin tableau the flesh possesses you rebuke it

26:18.500 --> 26:26.260
and be free or perish as a slave for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life

26:26.260 --> 26:33.220
and christ jesus our lord you people do love to rebuke things don't you justin the love you yearn

26:33.220 --> 26:34.060
for can only be found in the sacrifice reward of your own blood jesus our lord you people do love to rebuke things don't you justin the love you yearn for can only

26:34.060 --> 26:42.360
be found in Jesus. Only he can fill the void. I know. I used to be like you, Justin. I was lost.

26:42.600 --> 26:49.280
I was blind. I was confused in my identity. I used to reject the gospel until my sin took

26:49.280 --> 26:55.280
everything from me and I needed a savior. And then I called out to God for salvation

26:55.280 --> 27:03.400
and he came to me as a loving father. It's not too late for you, Justin. You are so loved.

27:04.060 --> 27:11.200
God loves you. But this? This is not God's intent for you. It is ridiculous to me that

27:11.200 --> 27:16.220
you think you know God's intent. The height of cosmological narcissism. I'm sorry,

27:16.220 --> 27:21.900
has Reddit gone offline? Have we run out of fedoras in America? I'm just trying to

27:21.900 --> 27:25.940
understand why you hate God. I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.

27:26.300 --> 27:34.020
God is love. Is he? The only love worth having. What you call love. The sin I used to live in.

27:34.060 --> 27:40.860
The world, the flesh, and the devil. That only ever brought me pain. Yes, because heartbreak is

27:40.860 --> 27:49.840
painful. Love is painful. The poets are unanimous. Love is bittersweet, says Sappho. Eros, giver of

27:49.840 --> 27:55.960
pain. What's Sappho? A pagan pornographer. The sort of filth these people want to teach to

27:55.960 --> 28:01.700
children. Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is, then goddammit,

28:01.900 --> 28:03.620
I don't know who can.

28:04.500 --> 28:11.740
God for one. God has a sexual plan for all of us. That's hot. God's plan is for male and female to

28:11.740 --> 28:18.060
be one flesh. Men's and women's bodies fit together for the purpose of creating children.

28:18.180 --> 28:23.700
You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right? Seminal fluids are not difficult

28:23.700 --> 28:30.060
to come by, even in this economy. You have a guy? A semen guy? That's just most guys.

28:30.220 --> 28:34.040
Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics, but-

28:34.040 --> 28:39.960
Since I'm among heathens, clearly, I will do my best to argue not from faith,

28:40.520 --> 28:47.700
but from reason. I love reason. Do you? Tell me this, Justin, which is better? A love that is

28:47.700 --> 28:54.160
eternal, or a love that can be ripped away at any moment? I'm sorry your girlfriend left you,

28:54.260 --> 28:58.200
that must have been really hard. Just answer the question. Nothing is eternal, Virginia.

28:58.720 --> 29:03.100
Except maybe sanctimonious assholes. Isn't a love that is eternal,

29:04.040 --> 29:10.760
superior to a love that is fleeting? Yes, Socrates, it is certain. And don't you yearn?

29:10.960 --> 29:17.700
Not just for a love in the moment, but for a love that lasts eternity? Yes, Socrates,

29:17.920 --> 29:28.560
that is evident. And isn't eternal love what we call God? Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,

29:28.560 --> 29:31.480
but sometimes we don't get what we want.

29:32.480 --> 29:34.000
So you have-

29:34.040 --> 29:36.100
I have no argument.

29:36.200 --> 29:37.160
Do I really need an argument?

29:37.660 --> 29:42.500
This is just a semantic trick. You're saying that God is eternal love, and then

29:42.500 --> 29:47.060
magically that must exist because you defined it that way?

29:47.160 --> 29:52.360
So you don't have an argument? I'm sorry.

29:52.500 --> 29:52.980
Interesting.

29:53.140 --> 29:57.480
I didn't prepare to have a debate about neoplatonism with a five-alarm lesbo

29:57.480 --> 30:03.720
cosplaying as a trad wife. I'm supposed to take this seriously? Why? Why am I even here? What am

30:03.720 --> 30:09.680
I doing? Why am I talking to these people? I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.

30:10.040 --> 30:16.180
I don't think God leads people to podcasts. Clearly, this transgender identity of yours

30:16.180 --> 30:23.440
is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside. There's a hunger in your soul. No pleasure

30:23.440 --> 30:31.380
of the flesh can satisfy. Do you not feel the thirst in your body like a parched land? Well,

30:31.940 --> 30:33.660
yeah, I feel the thirst.

30:33.720 --> 30:35.400
I'm sure we all feel the thirst.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.160
If I may quote Psalm 63.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.040
Please don't.

30:38.120 --> 30:46.400
You, God, are my God. Earnestly, I seek you. I thirst for you. My whole being longs for you

30:46.400 --> 30:53.800
in a dry and parched land where there is no water. Because your love is better than life.

30:54.380 --> 31:02.720
My lips will glorify you. I will praise you as long as I live. And in your name, I will raise up

31:02.720 --> 31:03.680
my hands.

31:04.160 --> 31:12.760
I will be fully satisfied as in the richest of foods. With singing lips, my mouth will praise you.

31:14.200 --> 31:20.800
Virginia, go to therapy, says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman. You're the one who needs

31:20.800 --> 31:26.660
to go to therapy. No, you go to therapy. I'll pray for you. I'll pray for you. I will pray

31:26.660 --> 31:33.120
straight to Satan. Look, can't we just agree that we are all a little Looney Tunes? You have your

31:33.120 --> 31:41.000
Jesus bullshit. You have your gender nonsense. And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.

31:41.460 --> 31:48.620
The free market. Right. We all have our little delusions. The important thing is that we cling

31:48.620 --> 31:54.900
to them. And we never let go, no matter how much evidence gets in the way. Because that's what

31:54.900 --> 32:02.520
makes us free. And freedom is what makes America great. Other countries, they don't have choices.

32:03.400 --> 32:10.740
But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want. So can we do drugs? No,

32:11.020 --> 32:15.580
that's illegal. I thought you said we could choose. Yes, but we have to make the right

32:15.580 --> 32:21.260
choices. And what if we want to make the wrong choices? Well, the boot of the law will crush

32:21.260 --> 32:27.120
you without mercy. You will be locked in a tiny cage. That is literally the opposite of freedom.

32:27.320 --> 32:32.820
Well, we have to be tough on crime. It's the only way to keep this country free. We have to build,

32:32.920 --> 32:33.100
rina.

32:33.120 --> 32:40.000
more prisons. Who decides what the right and wrong choices are? Well, father decides. Father

32:40.000 --> 32:46.400
always decides. And do you always do what father says? Of course, we always do what father says.

32:47.320 --> 32:53.920
Why? Because father says so. Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep

32:53.920 --> 32:58.800
with men? Oh, I don't want to sleep with men. Yes, you do. You're a man who struggles with gender

32:58.800 --> 33:05.380
confusion and same-sex temptation. No, I'm not. I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl. My heart was

33:05.380 --> 33:13.100
also broken by a woman. I thought she was a cat girl. She turned out to be a fuck boy. You are a

33:13.100 --> 33:20.740
straight man. I mean, at this point, I wish. But no, definitely a gay woman. We're all stuck with it.

33:20.740 --> 33:28.380
Hold on. So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman. Does that mean you're attracted

33:28.380 --> 33:28.780
to your...

33:28.800 --> 33:29.940
Self? No.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.220
In the mirror?

33:31.620 --> 33:36.420
No, because I'm not a fucking animal that can't tell the difference between my own reflection

33:36.420 --> 33:42.720
and a different person. Desire is always for something that you lack. You can't desire

33:42.720 --> 33:50.680
yourself because you're already one with yourself. Desire feeds on absence. It reaches out across

33:50.680 --> 33:55.960
a void. I don't know. I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.

33:55.960 --> 33:58.660
Okay. Well, thank you for sharing.

33:58.800 --> 34:06.380
Aren't a lot of serial killers transgender? Do you have bodies in your basement? You better watch

34:06.380 --> 34:11.620
out or you're gonna be next. Are those clothes even yours? Or are you wearing the clothes of

34:11.620 --> 34:18.540
your victims? Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver, and I will feast upon

34:18.540 --> 34:25.460
it. Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts. It's not enough for

34:25.460 --> 34:28.660
you to possess a woman. You also have to appropriate female...

34:28.660 --> 34:33.580
...female beauty for yourself. Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia? You're the

34:33.580 --> 34:37.120
one who keeps bringing that up. Nice. Got her!

34:37.120 --> 34:41.980
Shut up, dum-dum. I said it to hurt her, not to entertain you. You stay out of this.

34:41.980 --> 34:48.120
Look, so you're a straight man. You could've had a wife. You could've raised a family.

34:48.120 --> 34:52.820
Your life could've meant something. But you threw it all away? You really think having

34:52.820 --> 34:58.440
babies is the only way to have a meaningful life? Do you have babies? Well, priests don't

34:58.440 --> 35:04.100
have babies. Maybe think of queer people as priests. Except, you know, the people we

35:04.100 --> 35:09.520
have sex with are adults. Whoa! Okay. That's Catholics. That's not Christians. It's kind

35:09.520 --> 35:15.080
of crossing a line, don't you think? Oh, has free speech gone too far? Now it's gone too

35:15.080 --> 35:21.140
far? Can we have a civil conversation, please? Is it impossible to have a civil conversation

35:21.140 --> 35:26.400
in America today? Well, that ship has sailed and sunk. Virginia, I believe you are about

35:26.400 --> 35:27.400
to exercise Christian humility by... ...having sex with a woman. I don't know. I don't know.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.400
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

35:28.440 --> 35:32.220
want to hear you 심erely explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more

35:32.220 --> 35:40.560
meaningful than mine. I walk with the spirit until I go to glory. That's my meaning. Your

35:40.560 --> 35:47.520
meaning...is what? To fabricate an already-fading illusion of feminine beauty until you rot

35:47.520 --> 35:55.080
away unresurrected in the earth? And for what? To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?

35:55.080 --> 35:57.740
Anything else would be a lie.

35:57.740 --> 36:04.260
exists I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours and with or without your approval and understanding

36:04.260 --> 36:13.920
I will always be the way I am look can't we reach a reasonable compromise I think you should have

36:13.920 --> 36:23.360
the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into just leave children out of it like whatever

36:23.360 --> 36:31.760
this is keep this away from children and that's why we should increase police funding to fight

36:31.760 --> 36:48.860
the war on drugs I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are I know my

36:48.860 --> 36:52.880
place in this world I've found a love family

36:53.360 --> 37:02.400
belonging fellowship in the church have you found fellowship in the lgbt2a dollar sign community

37:02.400 --> 37:10.400
well obviously not because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other case in point though

37:10.400 --> 37:18.320
you are one of the worst I've ever seen so you're alone you're far from God's grace and you have

37:18.320 --> 37:23.280
no cat girl gf can you honestly say that you're happy

37:23.280 --> 37:23.340
you're far from God's grace and you have no cat girl gf can you honestly say that you're happy

37:23.340 --> 37:30.460
that you're fulfilled that you have purpose that you have

37:53.340 --> 38:04.060
still you're reliable and open and the way you seem and the reason for being here so

38:04.060 --> 38:08.380
that you just be loved is

38:08.380 --> 38:18.540
beautiful you say roll over surrender

38:19.000 --> 38:21.500
for me

38:21.500 --> 38:22.700
impressive

38:22.700 --> 38:23.200
right

38:23.200 --> 38:23.440
Hello?

38:29.600 --> 38:30.040
Jesus.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.440
Don't say that name in front of me.

38:33.600 --> 38:34.920
How did you get in my house?

38:35.620 --> 38:38.020
Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.

38:38.960 --> 38:39.840
Who are you?

38:40.540 --> 38:41.320
What are you?

38:41.320 --> 38:44.660
Well, I used to be an angel.

38:45.460 --> 38:46.300
And now?

38:47.440 --> 38:51.320
Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.

38:51.320 --> 38:53.820
A satanic visitation.

38:54.340 --> 39:00.600
At this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the country, localized entirely within my bathroom?

39:01.380 --> 39:01.860
Yes.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.280
Is this going to be a weird sex thing?

39:05.040 --> 39:06.500
Do you want it to be?

39:06.800 --> 39:07.220
No.

39:07.740 --> 39:09.140
Look, I've had a terrible day.

39:09.140 --> 39:10.860
I'm really not in the mood for this.

39:11.620 --> 39:13.240
Well, I can help you with that.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.480
Can you?

39:15.140 --> 39:15.620
Sure.

39:16.040 --> 39:17.200
I can help with anything.

39:17.680 --> 39:20.720
Depression, anxiety, insomnia.

39:21.320 --> 39:26.920
Pain, boredom, failure, shame.

39:28.340 --> 39:29.340
Shame?

39:30.340 --> 39:31.340
Is it the shame?

39:31.940 --> 39:34.000
Well, yeah, there's the shame.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.660
There's always going to be the shame.

39:36.140 --> 39:37.640
But it's a complex cocktail.

39:37.640 --> 39:38.560
There's the heartbreak.

39:38.560 --> 39:40.440
There's the loneliness, the self-loathing.

39:40.980 --> 39:42.500
I'm a parched land, Luce.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.640
I've got the hunger, the emptiness inside.

39:45.740 --> 39:48.340
Oh, emptiness inside.

39:48.880 --> 39:50.220
Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.

39:50.220 --> 39:50.900
Let me fill you up.

39:50.900 --> 39:51.300
Let me fill you up.

39:51.320 --> 39:54.600
I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.

39:54.700 --> 39:56.220
It's not a weird sex thing.

39:57.260 --> 39:58.680
Potions, Justine.

39:59.340 --> 39:59.940
Potions.

40:00.420 --> 40:03.460
I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.

40:04.640 --> 40:05.280
Potions?

40:06.400 --> 40:10.340
Elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.840
Think of me as a salesman.

40:13.540 --> 40:14.720
An apothecary.

40:15.800 --> 40:16.300
A dealer.

40:17.580 --> 40:19.680
Are you trying to get demonetized?

40:20.240 --> 40:20.720
Sorry.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.320
What potions do you have?

40:23.320 --> 40:27.320
Well, this is one of my favorites.

40:27.320 --> 40:30.320
It's called hype.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.320
This will make you come alive.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.320
You'll jump right out of your shell.

40:34.320 --> 40:39.320
Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.

40:39.320 --> 40:43.320
You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.320
You'll finally get things done.

40:45.320 --> 40:48.320
You'll connect with people.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.320
You'll always know just what to say.

40:51.320 --> 40:54.320
Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.

40:54.320 --> 40:58.320
At this point, I just want the pain to stop.

40:59.320 --> 41:00.320
Pain?

41:00.320 --> 41:04.320
Well, I surely have something for that.

41:04.320 --> 41:07.320
It's called void.

41:07.320 --> 41:12.320
One drop of this and all the pain will melt away.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.320
The aches of the body.

41:14.320 --> 41:16.320
The agitation of desire.

41:16.320 --> 41:18.320
The sting of heartbreak.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.320
Boredom.

41:19.320 --> 41:20.320
Grief.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.320
And shame.

41:22.320 --> 41:30.320
All of that will fade away under a warm blanket of serenity and love.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.320
Yes, I know what void is.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.320
But that's a very hard potion.

41:35.320 --> 41:38.320
And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.

41:38.320 --> 41:42.320
Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.

41:42.320 --> 41:45.320
You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness?

41:45.320 --> 41:47.320
All alone?

41:47.320 --> 41:54.320
What, do you need a clear mind to process how bad you were on that podcast?

41:54.320 --> 41:55.320
Because it was embarrassing.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.320
Humiliating, honestly.

41:56.320 --> 41:58.320
It was difficult to watch.

41:58.320 --> 41:59.320
Shut up.

41:59.320 --> 42:01.320
Is it some kind of masochism?

42:01.320 --> 42:04.320
You just want to feel all the pain, man?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.320
Because you're not impressing anyone.

42:06.320 --> 42:08.320
I mean, what is your plan for this evening?

42:08.320 --> 42:11.320
You're going to sit around stalking your ex on social media all night?

42:11.320 --> 42:13.320
Because that is pathetic.

42:13.320 --> 42:15.320
And it's so unnecessary.

42:15.320 --> 42:18.320
Because you're choosing to feel bad.

42:18.320 --> 42:23.320
When with one drop of void, you can be in bliss.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.320
Pass.

42:27.320 --> 42:29.320
The cool kids are doing it.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.320
The cool kids are absolutely not doing it.

42:31.320 --> 42:33.320
Because it's not the 90s.

42:33.320 --> 42:35.320
Kids today are vaping Benadryl.

42:35.320 --> 42:37.320
Don't you keep up with this?

42:37.320 --> 42:40.320
Okay, I mean, I respect your choice.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.320
But I'm not going anywhere.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.320
I will stay right here.

42:44.320 --> 42:54.320
And I will remind you every minute for hundreds of consecutive minutes that your pain is optional.

42:54.320 --> 42:57.320
And I have the antidote right here.

42:57.320 --> 43:01.320
But I guess you'd just rather feel pain.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.320
And shame.

43:03.320 --> 43:05.320
And humiliation.

43:05.320 --> 43:07.320
And heartbreak.

43:07.320 --> 43:09.320
And boredom.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.320
Loneliness.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.320
Despair.

43:13.320 --> 43:16.320
Disappointment.

43:16.320 --> 43:18.320
Failure.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.320
Anguish.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.320
Frustration.

43:22.320 --> 43:25.320
Look, I'm a smart person, okay?

43:25.320 --> 43:29.320
And I'm not going to let you turn me into some kind of pathetic junkie.

43:29.320 --> 43:31.320
Pathetic?

43:31.320 --> 43:35.320
Is it pathetic to feel good?

43:35.320 --> 43:39.320
Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.320
And to me,

43:41.320 --> 43:44.320
that's pathetic.

43:44.320 --> 43:48.320
Well, the thing about that...

43:53.320 --> 43:55.320
Okay, just give me the cocktail void.

43:55.320 --> 43:57.320
Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.

43:57.320 --> 43:59.320
I thought I was going to be here all night.

43:59.320 --> 44:01.320
Well, my will is weak, okay?

44:01.320 --> 44:03.320
Can I have the potion, please?

44:03.320 --> 44:05.320
Alright, well, let's be a little patient.

44:05.320 --> 44:07.320
You should really do this the right way, okay?

44:07.320 --> 44:09.320
It's called harm reduction.

44:09.320 --> 44:12.320
What you're going to do is put one drop,

44:12.320 --> 44:14.320
and only one drop,

44:14.320 --> 44:17.320
of pure void into water.

44:17.320 --> 44:19.320
This is important.

44:19.320 --> 44:22.320
Do not do too many drops.

44:22.320 --> 44:24.320
What happens if I do too many drops?

44:24.320 --> 44:26.320
Oh, you'll probably die.

44:26.320 --> 44:27.320
I'll die?

44:27.320 --> 44:29.320
I told you it was important.

44:29.320 --> 44:31.320
Well, how many drops is too many drops?

44:31.320 --> 44:34.320
Well, it's difficult to say exactly.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.320
It depends on a lot of factors.

44:36.320 --> 44:37.320
Seriously?

44:37.320 --> 44:38.320
But it's your first time.

44:38.320 --> 44:40.320
So just do one.

44:49.320 --> 44:52.320
So, do I just drink it, or...

44:52.320 --> 44:53.320
Of course you drink it.

44:53.320 --> 44:55.320
It's a purely fictional magical potion

44:55.320 --> 44:58.320
utterly disconnected from any real-world social issues.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.320
What else would you do with it?

45:00.320 --> 45:01.320
Okay.

45:08.320 --> 45:12.320
Good girl.

45:12.320 --> 45:14.320
I don't feel anything.

45:14.320 --> 45:16.320
Okay, well, give it a minute.

45:16.320 --> 45:17.320
In about 15 seconds,

45:17.320 --> 45:19.320
you are not going to know the meaning of the word pain.

45:19.320 --> 45:21.320
Are you ready for that?

45:21.320 --> 45:22.320
Lucy,

45:22.320 --> 45:25.320
I have never been more ready for anything

45:25.320 --> 45:29.320
in my god damn life.

45:38.320 --> 45:40.320
There she goes.

45:42.320 --> 45:43.320
Thank god!

45:45.320 --> 45:47.320
Well don't thank god, thank me.

45:47.320 --> 45:49.320
I will not have a father taking credit for my work.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.320
Ahhhhh.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.320
The Thin Sleeves

45:55.320 --> 45:59.320
Boyfriend

45:59.320 --> 46:29.300
To be continued...

46:29.320 --> 46:50.380
Lucy? Lucy? Luciferia? Mother? A doctor? Mother-doctor? Doctor-mother? Mom? Mother-void? Mother-void?

46:51.960 --> 46:52.520
Yes?

46:54.760 --> 46:58.060
Help me, Doctor. I'm being cancelled.

46:58.940 --> 46:59.300
Oh, no.

46:59.320 --> 47:03.180
So a bunch of furries are mad at you online. So what?

47:03.760 --> 47:07.680
You don't understand, Doctor. I'm in love with this furry.

47:08.400 --> 47:12.560
You really are far from God. You're further from God than I am.

47:12.740 --> 47:15.600
Lucy, can I get a drop?

47:16.240 --> 47:20.620
A drop? I thought you didn't want to go down dark paths.

47:22.000 --> 47:23.740
Doctor, my pain is at a ten.

47:24.680 --> 47:28.920
I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again. I'm a little disappointed,

47:28.920 --> 47:35.300
honestly. I enjoy the thrill of the chase. But there's no chase with you. No chase at all.

47:35.660 --> 47:41.680
You're easy. An easy little void slut. A slut for the void.

47:42.800 --> 47:48.580
Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy. Please, just give me the void so I can

47:48.580 --> 47:56.020
fill the emptiness. If it's the void you want, the void you shall have. But you don't call me Lucy

47:56.040 --> 47:57.300
anymore, understand?

47:58.120 --> 47:58.340
Yes?

47:58.340 --> 48:07.060
call me mommy now because I own you yes mommy dearest

48:28.340 --> 48:55.840
you

48:58.340 --> 49:28.320
Thank you.

49:28.340 --> 49:34.220
Five drops already. Escalating, aren't we?

49:34.540 --> 49:37.180
Well, yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.

49:38.040 --> 49:39.920
So you're going to do five drops?

49:40.120 --> 49:45.600
Just to take the edge off. I need five drops to take the edge off, so I'm going to do five drops.

49:46.400 --> 49:53.060
Oh, wow. If it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument. By all means, continue.

49:53.660 --> 49:56.540
Well, thank you for being supportive. Cheers.

49:58.340 --> 50:28.320
Thank you.

50:28.340 --> 50:30.340
Cheers.

50:58.340 --> 51:08.880
That was dumb. That was so dumb.

51:14.300 --> 51:15.380
Shit.

51:20.260 --> 51:21.900
I need to quit.

51:23.900 --> 51:26.400
I've got to quit. I'm going to quit.

51:28.340 --> 51:29.860
Oh, you're going to quit, are you?

51:30.180 --> 51:33.920
Yes, Mother. I'm going to quit. I just...

51:33.920 --> 51:35.760
Good luck.

51:36.840 --> 51:42.140
I'll quit after one more drop.

51:42.240 --> 51:42.940
Of course.

51:49.300 --> 51:51.940
All right, that's it. Never again.

51:53.620 --> 51:54.420
I'm quitting.

51:57.620 --> 51:58.320
I quit.

51:58.340 --> 51:59.000
I quit.

52:02.120 --> 52:07.740
It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.140
How hard could that be?

52:28.340 --> 52:38.340
No. I can't do this. I can't do this.

52:38.340 --> 52:40.720
Shit. Shit.

52:53.020 --> 52:57.620
Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Lucy. Lucy!

52:58.340 --> 53:03.340
Lucy, I'm with the flurry. Wake up, Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Wake up!

53:28.340 --> 53:30.340
I'm with the flurry.

53:58.340 --> 54:00.340
I'm with the flurry.

54:28.340 --> 54:58.320
Thank you.

54:58.340 --> 55:28.320
Thank you.

55:28.340 --> 55:58.320
Thank you.

55:58.340 --> 56:28.320
Thank you.

56:28.340 --> 56:58.320
Thank you.

56:58.340 --> 57:28.320
Thank you.

57:28.340 --> 57:33.440
Thank you.
