0	20060	All right, children. It's a new decade. It's time to face the facts. How do I put this
20060	27760	delicately? Your humble hostess is a total les. Shame. You're probably worried this
27760	34100	is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is, but oh, it's so much worse
34100	40080	than just that. You know, one, coming out may be regarded as a misfortune. Two, looks
40080	44660	like carelessness. And three, well, at that point, you're just doing it for attention.
44980	50380	And I do love attention. I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be
50380	55300	gay. Some gay people love attention. It's been known to happen. So there comes a time
55300	60520	in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself in the mirror, and
60520	66840	admit, this is some high-key, lesbicious behavior. And I'm going to talk you through how I got
66840	71660	to that point. So, story time, I fell in love with my best friend. Story time, telling my
71660	76360	boyfriend I'm a lesbian. Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang. Exposed,
76600	81340	graphic, the tea is piping hot. For a long time on this channel, the official story has
81340	85280	been that I'm bi. I'm a super fucking bi. But I haven't dated.
85300	89880	I haven't dated women since I transitioned. And for a while there, I got pretty deep into
89880	95720	the straight lifestyle. This really started in 2018. By that summer, I had privately convinced
95720	101960	myself that I was a fully heterosexual woman. And we're going to circle back to how I reached
101960	106460	that conclusion. But I'm starting in the middle of things. I'm like an epic poet.
107380	112400	Hail Muse. Hey, how are you, gorge? So at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends,
112400	115060	I'd even say best friends, with a woman whom
115300	123900	I'll call Joanne. Light of my life. Can we get some melodramatic music, please? Yeah,
123900	127460	here we go. You're going to want to pour yourself a glass of something nice. I want you to fully
127460	133120	enjoy my pain. So my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast. It was that kind
133120	137600	of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and in-jokes, and you
137600	141260	drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter. We'd call each other
141260	145280	pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours. And I don't think I've ever called her and
145280	149920	not been laughing or smiling in the first 20 seconds, which is very unusual for me, because
149920	155120	I am a weird, and I don't get along that well with that many people. One reason we got so emotionally
155120	160480	close is we're both trans. And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that
160480	166000	I can share with another trans woman that I can't really have with anyone else. Oh, and by the way,
166000	173600	Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful, which I did notice every time I looked at her.
173600	175040	And from the beginning of this relationship,
175280	181300	it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly platonic either. We'd get drunk and make out. We'd sleep in
181300	188300	the same bed and cuddle. Straight girls do that, right? Gal pals. I remember one of the first times
188300	192440	I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together. And that night, we were bar hopping,
192660	197520	and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand, and we walked down the street together holding
197520	203640	hands. This is garbage, and I want to die. I hope you all know that I'm in agony. Later,
203640	205100	we were at a bar table with friends.
205280	210420	And every time one of us needed a drink, we'd run off to the bar, and she'd secretly kiss me.
210420	214700	Ah, it's still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.
214700	219860	Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care. A lot of men think girls kissing is hot,
219860	223740	but they don't take it seriously. They don't think it could ever mean anything or
223740	230140	lead to a real relationship. Gal pals. Just kill me. Take me out behind the shed,
230140	235060	put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before the kids get home, and they won't know,
235280	240740	I guess. So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to
240740	246440	Joanne or to myself that I was falling in love. So not only was I in denial about being in love
246440	252680	with her, but at the same time, I had basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.
252680	258980	So how could I possibly think that? Well, the short answer is shame. Why is no one talking
258980	265260	about the shame? I was so ashamed of my attraction to women. There were days I thought the shame was
265260	270860	going to crush me to death. Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad, and let no one say I didn't make
270860	276420	a strong attempt. There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in a town square with
276420	282240	the inscription, here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual. I'm a bronze star lesbian. Well,
282760	288240	if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star. Oh, I was desperate to be straight.
288240	295040	I tried prayer. I tried electric shocks. All the classics. All the hits. You know, the idea is,
295040	298600	if you shock yourself every time you think about women, you start to associate the two in your
298600	305620	head. So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks. This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel
305620	309860	like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett. So at some point, the shame was just too much for me,
310060	315760	and it literally broke my brain. I no longer wanted to be straight. I simply deluded myself
315760	322200	into thinking I was straight. Maybe a little bi. A little bi. By that time, I started dating men,
322200	324960	and I got into a serious long-term relationship,
325040	328960	with a man. And at first, I explained away my feelings for Joanne, by telling myself,
328960	334080	female friendships are just really intense. That's probably why I feel so strongly. And
334080	339600	everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I notice that. And, you know,
341520	346480	spend a lot of time thinking about it. So this nonsense went on until the beginning
346480	352080	of last year, and then two things happened. First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.
355040	358800	Second, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian. Third, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.
358800	362640	Fuck my drag, right? I think before that, I always knew she was bi, but
363200	368320	some combination of self-interested denial and biphobia allowed me to write off my initial
368320	373200	crush on her as, I just have a thing for my straight best friend. Like, who doesn't?
373200	377040	But that's a very self-serving narrative, because it quarantines your feelings inside
377040	382080	the safety of unattainable fantasy, and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.
382080	384720	Because that way, it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just,
385120	387840	she's just not that into women. But once she started dating women,
388560	394720	I couldn't tell myself that anymore. And the jealousy hit me so hard, I couldn't ignore it.
394720	398880	Second, around that same time, Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.
398880	401760	It was a long-distance friendship. And about halfway through that visit,
402400	409600	I cracked. One morning, I woke up next to her, and I looked at her pretty fucking face,
409600	414000	and I had the thought, I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.
414720	421680	And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual bio girl to have about her gal pal.
421680	427680	Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone. Like, what the fuck is this?
427680	433520	What am I feeling? I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of
433520	440560	19th century Italian opera. So I confessed my feelings to Joanne, and love confession gone wrong,
440560	441520	devastating.
441520	442160	...
442160	442660	...
442660	443160	...
443160	443660	...
443660	444160	...
444160	444660	...
444660	445160	...
445160	445660	...
445660	449020	Nurse! My pain is at a 10, I need more pills!
449020	452700	Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah,
452700	454260	I'm sure we all know how that goes.
454260	458340	And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three-month friendship break right then and there,
458940	464020	I might have recovered. But we couldn't keep away from each other. She wasn't in love with me, but
464020	469380	she must have been in something with me, because the truth is, we were never just gal pals.
469380	473220	And I was beyond reason. Like, I probably would have started one of those
473220	478480	... lesbian couple joint Instagram accounts, that's how tragic this got. Those are great, by the way.
478480	480000	Pay no attention to bitter queens.
480000	485480	So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other, and I just repeated this
485480	490880	heartbreak again and again and again. Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have
490880	495720	come out as gay last year, because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating
495720	501200	shame. But rejection and heartbreak are shameful in themselves, and only made the situation worse.
501200	501220	So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of bed with Joanne, and I was like, what the fuck is going on?
501220	501320	I was like, what the fuck is going on? I was like, what the fuck is going on? I was like, what the fuck is going on?
501320	507560	So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial, until finally, last October, I got super
507560	512280	fucking cancelled on Twitter as discussed in my last video. Link in the description! Subscribe!
512280	516600	And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was going to have to be the one to enforce a
516600	521000	friendship break, otherwise I was never going to get over her. So there was this combination of
521000	526200	things, being politically cancelled by Twitter, being romantically cancelled by Joanne, and also
526200	530600	losing her as my closest friend, which sent me into this catatonic,
530600	531300	rock-bottom,
531320	536360	kind of depression. And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a
536360	542280	purpose. Because depression brings your life to a standstill, and in the quiet of that standstill,
542280	546920	you sometimes feel outside yourself. And with that, comes a new perspective.
546920	550840	So last December, when I was lying around drinking White Claw all day and
550840	556280	binge-watching Orange is the Bluest L Word, I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.
556280	560520	And that gave me a new kind of clarity. I looked back on the last couple years,
560520	566440	and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious. So that's what it took for me to finally face the
566440	572480	fact that I am a, uh… I am a gay, not clickbait.
572480	574420	I'm sorry.
574420	575420	No, no.
575420	576420	I'm sorry.
576420	577420	You're not.
577420	578420	You're not.
578420	579420	You're not.
579420	580420	You're not.
580420	581420	You're not.
581420	582420	You're not.
582420	583420	You're not.
583420	584420	You're not.
584420	585420	You're not.
585420	586420	You're not.
586420	587420	You're not.
587420	588420	You're not.
588420	589420	You're not.
589420	590420	You're not.
590520	597520	Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.
603520	604520	Shame.
604520	607520	This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind
607520	610520	and a little more Coachella 2015.
610520	611520	Well that's my Eden.
611520	613520	Candy flipping. I love it.
613520	617520	Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me
617520	619520	wound up in the clutches of the straight agenda.
619520	622520	It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.
622520	626520	First, there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.
626520	628520	Female friendships are just really intense.
628520	630520	Straight girls have girl crushes too.
630520	634520	And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought
634520	636520	was sexual and romantic attraction to men.
636520	639520	And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.
639520	641520	Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video,
641520	645520	but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame will overpower me again
645520	647520	and I'll slide back into denial.
647520	649520	So, while I'm still here,
649520	651520	still thinking semi-clearly,
651520	653520	let me talk you through the struggle.
653520	655520	Because, like most queer people,
655520	658520	I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis of my own personality.
658520	659520	She's a Libra.
659520	662520	So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.
662520	665520	And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that,
665520	667520	like, it makes you grow breasts.
667520	669520	At least, in theory.
669520	672520	I just added progesterone, we'll see if that does anything.
672520	676520	But the lesser known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your sexuality.
676520	678520	The first few months I was on hormones,
679520	681520	I didn't know if I was now asexual
681520	684520	because the libido I had known before was just gone.
684520	686520	But I'm very much not asexual.
686520	692520	It just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically female sex drive.
692520	694520	One of the differences for me is
694520	697520	it's not as obvious now whomst I'm attracted to.
697520	699520	Just looking at an attractive person,
699520	701520	well, let's put it this way,
701520	703520	it sparks my interest,
703520	705520	but it doesn't light my fire.
705520	708520	It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.
708520	711520	It's a slow burn that has to be built up.
711520	713520	Some people call this demisexual,
713520	716520	which is a term I'm ambivalent about,
716520	719520	but I think the concept it describes applies to me.
719520	723520	Like, I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,
723520	726520	but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone
726520	728520	until I've gotten close to them as a friend.
728520	732520	So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?
732520	734520	Can't I just find a new best friend,
734520	737520	fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay married?
737520	739520	I know that's not how it works.
739520	740520	I have to play the field.
740520	743520	I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.
743520	747520	Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.
747520	748520	It's boring.
748520	751520	The buildup of desire, that's the interesting part,
751520	754520	and the struggle between desire and shame.
754520	756520	I shouldn't, but I want to.
756520	758520	That's how you build a plotline, kids.
758520	761520	I'm also guessing this kind of slow burn sexuality
761520	763520	is more common in women than men.
763520	766520	And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men
766520	769520	tend to know they're gay at an earlier age than gay women.
769520	771520	When you have teenage boy testosterone levels,
771520	775520	it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about who you're attracted to.
775520	778520	Whereas, there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're gay
778520	780520	until they're in their 30s or even later.
780520	782520	And thank God for them!
782520	784520	They make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.
784520	787520	So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest
787520	789520	as a guide to my sexuality.
789520	793520	Because I do feel aesthetic attraction towards beautiful people of any gender,
793520	795520	and that can be pretty intense in its own right.
795520	797520	I guess the difference for me is
797520	799520	looking at a beautiful woman
799520	802520	is more emotionally captivating to me
802520	804520	than looking at a beautiful man.
804520	806520	Which can be moving in its own way,
806520	809520	but it's more like the way I'm moved by,
809520	810520	I don't know,
810520	811520	the Parthenon.
811520	813520	You know, it's sturdy,
813520	814520	symmetrical,
814520	815520	has impressive columns.
815520	817520	That's not to say it's totally asexual.
817520	819520	I mean, I'd fuck the Parthenon.
819520	820520	I'd fuck it so hard.
820520	824520	I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity,
824520	827520	and maybe that stems from my pre-transition sense
827520	829520	of having failed at masculinity,
829520	831520	so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.
831520	833520	There's something about the contrast
833520	835520	between me and a masculine man
835520	838520	that's sexually intriguing to me.
838520	841520	Like I've sometimes pleasantly gasped
841520	845520	at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms
845520	849520	enfolding my smooth, fragile body.
849520	851520	Or maybe it's more Freudian,
851520	853520	the masculine man as Daddy,
853520	854520	the archetypal father,
854520	856520	the symbolic power of the phallus.
856520	859520	Penetration is the ultimate expression of desire and possession.
859520	862520	There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood,
862520	864520	and I think that's why I can look at a sexy man
864520	867520	and create plausible fantasies in my head
867520	870520	where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do things to me.
870520	873520	And I can find things I like about male bodies,
873520	875520	like they're very warm.
875520	878520	I love it when you get under the covers with a man
878520	879520	and he warms you up.
879520	881520	But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head
881520	882520	and she says,
882520	884520	but are you attracted to men?
884520	887520	Or do you just like being warm?
887520	889520	My attraction to women is very different.
889520	891520	I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like,
891520	895520	oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.
895520	898520	This is going to destroy me.
898520	899520	You know, it can actually be painful
899520	901520	how beautiful a woman is.
901520	903520	I've never once been in pain over male beauty,
903520	904520	but around Joanne,
904520	906520	once I was open about my feelings and things got bad,
906520	909520	there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her
909520	911520	and be like, don't even enter my line of sight right now.
911520	913520	You're too beautiful, I can't stand it.
913520	915520	There's a kind of sick masochism
915520	917520	in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.
917520	919520	It's insatiable, like an addiction.
919520	920520	And on the flip side,
920520	924520	there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.
924520	926520	I think that's what got me interested in men
926520	927520	in the first place.
927520	930520	It's that they're interested in me.
930520	932520	And that's pretty interesting.
932520	935520	I've felt desired by men
935520	937520	in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.
937520	939520	You know, a man will glower at you
939520	941520	with that agitation,
941520	943520	agitated, carnivorous desperation.
943520	945520	Fuck me up, King.
945520	946520	God, that's hot.
946520	947520	Gets me every time.
947520	950520	But notice how excitement at the attention,
950520	953520	the flattery of being desired,
953520	957520	is not the same thing as attraction to men.
957520	960520	You know, there's a difference between I want you
960520	962520	and I like that you want me.
962520	965520	But for a long time, I confused one for the other.
965520	967520	And one reason I was able to do that
967520	970520	is that the normative sexual role for women
970520	973520	is to be pursued, possessed, desired,
973520	976520	seduced, dominated by men.
976520	978520	It's all very passive.
978520	981520	And in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,
981520	983520	I've taken a very submissive role.
983520	986520	Sometimes I just submit to the glower
986520	988520	and let them do things to me.
988520	991520	And I do think that the thrill of being desired
991520	993520	is a valid thing to want.
993520	995520	I like that feeling myself,
995520	997520	and I do genuinely enjoy taking on
997520	999520	a more submissive role sometimes.
999520	1001520	But you have to go about it thoughtfully.
1001520	1003520	Because if you don't,
1003520	1007520	sexual submission can be a way to avoid
1007520	1010520	confronting what your desires actually are.
1010520	1012520	It's freedom from freedom.
1012520	1014520	And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation,
1014520	1016520	and ashamed of your transsexual body,
1016520	1019520	and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all
1019520	1022520	because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,
1022520	1025520	then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires
1025520	1027520	by letting someone else take control
1027520	1028520	can be the only way
1028520	1030520	you can enjoy sex at all.
1030520	1031520	And for a while,
1031520	1033520	it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.
1033520	1036520	And I was able to convince myself that was normal
1036520	1040520	because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women
1040520	1042520	isn't really that much more liberated.
1042520	1045520	Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago
1045520	1047520	and totally identified with the fantasy.
1047520	1048520	And later,
1048520	1050520	I thought that was evidence
1050520	1052520	I had normative female desires.
1052520	1054520	Never mind that I was identifying
1054520	1056520	with the midlife crisis fantasies
1056520	1058520	of a repressed English housewife,
1058520	1061520	longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.
1061520	1062520	I mean, not to shame women
1062520	1066520	who genuinely do enjoy a healthier version of that fantasy,
1066520	1067520	I think a lot of women
1067520	1070520	pointlessly suffer under a kind of feminist guilt about that.
1070520	1072520	But what makes me different is that for me,
1072520	1074520	submission to a man
1074520	1077520	was simply the only way I could enjoy sex without shame.
1077520	1079520	And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,
1079520	1083520	even though my real sexual attraction is to women.
1083520	1086520	Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,
1086520	1088520	straight women are,
1088520	1090520	ultimately attracted to men,
1090520	1092520	and sexually aroused by male bodies.
1092520	1093520	Or are they?
1093520	1094520	Gay men certainly are,
1094520	1097520	and gay women are just rhapsodic about women.
1097520	1099520	But a lot of straight women are just kind of,
1099520	1100520	meh,
1100520	1102520	about male bodies and men in general.
1102520	1103520	Which,
1103520	1105520	what is that about?
1105520	1106520	I just,
1106520	1107520	I just,
1107520	1109520	do not understand straight women.
1109520	1111520	I don't think I ever will,
1111520	1112520	and that's okay.
1112520	1114520	I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment
1114520	1116520	and move on with my lesbian life.
1116520	1117520	Now,
1117520	1119520	what I've been giving you so far
1119520	1121520	is a retrospective analysis,
1121520	1125520	an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.
1125520	1126520	But you have to understand
1126520	1128520	that when I was living through this,
1128520	1129520	I experienced it very differently,
1129520	1131520	because I didn't have these insights.
1131520	1132520	So I wasn't thinking,
1132520	1134520	oh, I'm not really attracted to men,
1134520	1136520	but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,
1136520	1138520	so I'm gonna pursue that
1138520	1140520	to distract myself from how ashamed I am
1140520	1141520	of my attraction to women.
1141520	1142520	No.
1142520	1143520	Subconsciously,
1143520	1145520	I put my attraction to women on mute.
1145520	1146520	At least,
1146520	1147520	Joanne ruined my life.
1147520	1150520	And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,
1150520	1153520	which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.
1153520	1155520	I had a serious long-term boyfriend
1155520	1156520	for a year and a half,
1156520	1159520	who I had very genuine feelings for.
1159520	1160520	Plot twist,
1160520	1161520	story time.
1161520	1162520	So,
1162520	1163520	my ex-boyfriend,
1163520	1164520	let's call him
1166520	1167520	Chad.
1167520	1168520	Oh, and he was a Chad.
1168520	1169520	Like,
1169520	1171520	full Giga-Chad fantasy.
1171520	1173520	You know, he was very masculine,
1173520	1174520	taller than me,
1174520	1176520	objectively attractive,
1176520	1177520	very charming.
1177520	1179520	Straight women used to tell me all the time
1179520	1181520	they were jealous of me for being with him,
1181520	1183520	and obviously I loved that.
1183520	1184520	To me,
1184520	1185520	Chad represented
1185520	1187520	almost an ideal of manhood,
1187520	1189520	a sort of archetypal romantic lead
1189520	1191520	who swept me off my feet
1191520	1193520	and fulfilled my sick fantasies
1193520	1195520	of being a heterosexual woman.
1195520	1197520	Now, you probably think I'm gonna say
1197520	1199520	that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,
1199520	1201520	but that once it came to actually dating,
1201520	1203520	I realized I didn't like it.
1203520	1204520	But honestly,
1204520	1205520	it's more complicated than that.
1205520	1207520	Like, at the beginning,
1207520	1209520	I was the one who pursued him,
1209520	1211520	and I still think of him as the one
1211520	1213520	genuine boy crush of my life.
1213520	1214520	When we started dating,
1214520	1216520	it was really exciting.
1216520	1217520	I'd never had a boyfriend before,
1217520	1219520	and he'd never been with a trans woman before,
1219520	1221520	and we had this, like,
1221520	1223520	adorably heterosexual energy together,
1223520	1225520	like, holding hands in the park.
1225520	1226520	It was cute!
1226520	1228520	This would be a better lesbian story
1228520	1229520	if Chad was a Cad.
1229520	1230520	But he wasn't.
1230520	1231520	He was great.
1231520	1233520	He took very good care of me.
1233520	1234520	He was never ashamed to be seen,
1234520	1236520	or of his friends and family
1236520	1238520	knowing he was dating me,
1238520	1240520	which, if you're a trans woman,
1240520	1242520	that's a huge deal.
1242520	1244520	He was a lot less ashamed of me
1244520	1245520	than I am of myself.
1245520	1247520	And when I was with him,
1247520	1249520	I wasn't ashamed.
1249520	1251520	And that meant a lot.
1251520	1254520	So I really wanted this to work.
1254520	1256520	Like, if I was gonna be with a man,
1256520	1258520	he was the one.
1258520	1259520	And for a year or so,
1259520	1261520	I thought it was working.
1261520	1263520	I enjoyed the time we spent together.
1263520	1265520	I missed him when he was gone.
1265520	1267520	I told him I loved him,
1267520	1268520	and I meant it.
1268520	1269520	But what happened is,
1269520	1270520	by the end of the first year,
1270520	1273520	the initial excitement had died down.
1273520	1275520	And while Chad was ready
1275520	1277520	to keep escalating the relationship,
1277520	1279520	I was realizing that
1279520	1281520	something was very seriously,
1281520	1283520	emotionally wrong on my end.
1283520	1285520	There was something missing.
1285520	1286520	And when I realized
1286520	1288520	I was in love with Joanne,
1288520	1289520	I was like,
1289520	1291520	there's that missing feeling.
1291520	1292520	And I started to understand
1292520	1294520	what my problem was.
1294520	1296520	Then, last fall,
1296520	1298520	I posted to Instagram
1298520	1299520	an aloof picture of me
1299520	1300520	with the caption,
1300520	1302520	do I actually like men?
1302520	1304520	Or do I just like attention?
1304520	1306520	And I didn't mean anything serious by that.
1306520	1307520	I was just joking around.
1307520	1309520	You know, you can post something like that,
1309520	1311520	and a bunch of straight women will respond like,
1311520	1313520	yeah, fuck men.
1313520	1315520	What is their damage?
1315520	1316520	Well, they're stuck dating men.
1316520	1317520	That's their damage.
1317520	1319520	But a few people left comments saying,
1319520	1321520	oh, are you making a video about comphet?
1321520	1323520	You should make a video about comphet.
1323520	1324520	And I was like,
1324520	1326520	what the fuck is comphet?
1326520	1327520	So I Googled it,
1327520	1329520	and I learned that comphet is short
1329520	1332520	for compulsory heterosexuality.
1332520	1333520	Basically, it's the idea
1333520	1336520	that heterosexuality is socially required of women.
1336520	1339520	And it's so bound up with the conventional idea
1339520	1341520	of what it even means to be a woman
1341520	1344520	that gay women often mistakenly believe
1344520	1347520	for years that they're attracted to men.
1347520	1350520	And this Google search led me to a Reddit post
1350520	1352520	called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?
1352520	1354520	And I'm reading through this post like,
1354520	1358520	oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.
1358520	1359520	Quote,
1359520	1362520	compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head
1362520	1364520	that says I must really be het
1364520	1366520	even when I'm in love with a woman.
1366520	1367520	Quote,
1367520	1369520	you have every reason to be happy
1369520	1370520	in your relationship with a man,
1370520	1372520	but you just aren't.
1372520	1373520	Everything is going really well,
1373520	1374520	but something is missing
1374520	1376520	and you can't figure out what.
1376520	1377520	So next thing you know,
1377520	1379520	I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.
1379520	1381520	and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes
1381520	1383520	that were clearly designed for 13 year olds.
1383520	1386520	And I'm fully a 31 year old transsexual
1386520	1387520	taking this quiz like,
1387520	1389520	it's true, Samantha was right,
1389520	1391520	I am a total les.
1391520	1393520	All the cis gay people watching this video
1393520	1395520	probably want to kill me right now
1395520	1397520	because y'all figured this shit out in high school
1397520	1399520	and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,
1399520	1402520	it's just, I just, I just can't, I just.
1402520	1404520	Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay
1404520	1406520	for 30 minutes of my lifetime, please?
1406520	1408520	Is it all right with you, the gays?
1408520	1409520	So to be honest,
1409520	1413520	I still experience comphet thoughts and fantasies.
1413520	1414520	Like for a long time,
1414520	1416520	I've had what seemed to be romantic fantasies
1416520	1418520	about marrying a man.
1418520	1419520	But after a lot of introspection,
1419520	1423520	I've realized that this is not really a fantasy
1423520	1426520	of private happiness and fulfillment.
1426520	1430520	It's a fantasy of a social prestige and acceptance.
1430520	1432520	Like, can you imagine if I got married
1432520	1435520	to a tall, handsome man
1435520	1437520	at an opulent wedding
1437520	1440520	with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?
1440520	1443520	Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.
1443520	1445520	I'd be super heckin' valid, uwu.
1445520	1447520	But I don't actually want to be married.
1447520	1448520	I want to get married.
1448520	1450520	I want to have a wedding.
1450520	1452520	Basically, I want to wear a wedding dress.
1452520	1454520	I want attention, okay?
1454520	1456520	Please, pay, pay attention to me.
1456520	1459520	So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy,
1459520	1462520	but it's still really hard for me to let it go.
1462520	1465520	I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality
1465520	1467520	because there's a level
1467520	1470520	of gender instability and deviancy
1470520	1472520	that's inherent to homosexuality.
1472520	1473520	And until recently,
1473520	1477520	I wasn't secure enough in my gender to handle that.
1477520	1480520	Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,
1480520	1482520	and I think I needed to go through
1482520	1484520	the more one-on-one straight girl experience
1484520	1486520	before attempting anything as difficult as that.
1486520	1488520	I still have a hard time imagining
1488520	1490520	a happy future for myself
1490520	1492520	as a woman partnered to a woman.
1492520	1494520	And I think that's partly because
1494520	1496520	good lesbian representation in media
1496520	1498520	is so sparse.
1498520	1500520	The best we have is a Showtime melodrama
1500520	1502520	from 15 years ago,
1502520	1503520	which I do like,
1503520	1505520	and I like the new one too.
1505520	1506520	But after that,
1506520	1507520	the runner-up is,
1507520	1508520	I mean,
1508520	1511520	maybe not the lesbian representation we need.
1511520	1513520	It's a YouTube show about two drag queens
1513520	1514520	whomst we ship.
1514520	1515520	Well, I don't ship them,
1515520	1517520	because I have a fully lesbian
1517520	1518520	parasocial internet crush
1518520	1519520	on Katya Zamolochkova.
1519520	1520520	Don't laugh at me.
1520520	1521520	She's smart.
1521520	1522520	She's funny.
1522520	1523520	She's beautiful.
1523520	1525520	That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.
1525520	1526520	Sure, some haters and losers
1526520	1528520	will probably try to convince me
1528520	1530520	that Katya is in fact a homosexual man
1530520	1531520	posing as a woman,
1531520	1532520	but you know what?
1532520	1534520	This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life,
1534520	1536520	and I don't need this right now.
1538520	1540520	I need to be touched by a real woman.
1540520	1542520	I'm losing my goddamn mind.
1542520	1545520	It's so deeply embedded in our culture
1545520	1546520	that marrying a man
1546520	1548520	is the end goal of womanhood.
1548520	1550520	And it's not just Disney movies,
1550520	1552520	like, it's the Bible,
1552520	1554520	it's Greek mythology,
1554520	1555520	American fairy tales,
1555520	1556520	Victorian novels.
1556520	1557520	The whole weight of cultural history
1557520	1558520	is telling you
1558520	1560520	that what it means to succeed as a woman
1560520	1562520	is to marry a man.
1562520	1564520	And if you're already super dysphoric
1564520	1566520	and insecure about your gender,
1566520	1568520	then to reject that possibility?
1568520	1570520	Ah, it hurts.
1570520	1571520	It hurts so bad.
1571520	1572520	But whenever I think about
1572520	1573520	having a long-term partner,
1573520	1575520	you know, not the wedding day,
1575520	1579520	but the 1000th morning waking up together,
1579520	1581520	I can only imagine her being a woman.
1581520	1583520	My brain wants a good man
1583520	1585520	to take care of me.
1585520	1588520	But my heart wants a high-maintenance diva
1588520	1589520	to ruin my life.
1589520	1592520	And once I knew that for sure,
1592520	1595520	I thought it would be wrong to stay with Chad.
1595520	1597520	And this man was like my hinge.
1597520	1599520	He was holding me together.
1599520	1603520	But last December,
1603520	1605520	I broke up with him
1605520	1607520	because I'm a lesbian,
1607520	1611520	which at least is a good reason.
1613520	1616520	I'm having a hard time, you guys.
1616520	1618520	Leave your pity in the comments.
1618520	1620520	And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too.
1620520	1621520	I feel like shit.
1621520	1623520	I think it's the loss of my immortal soul
1623520	1624520	weighing on me.
1624520	1625520	I could really use a couple Advil
1625520	1626520	and a vodka tonic.
1626520	1628520	I think I might throw some clothes on, too.
1628520	1630520	Where's that snake?
1640520	1642520	I already miss my heterosexual nails.
1642520	1644520	I know these are too long to be gay,
1644520	1645520	but baby steps, okay?
1645520	1646520	This is hard for me.
1646520	1647520	Getting my acrylics removed?
1647520	1648520	Traumatizing.
1648520	1649520	I feel like I'm detransitioning.
1649520	1650520	One of these days,
1650520	1651520	I will do the lesbian manicure
1651520	1653520	with acrylics on eight fingers.
1653520	1654520	I just have to find the courage
1654520	1656520	to walk into a salon and say,
1656520	1658520	Hi, I'm a homosexual, please.
1658520	1660520	I want two short nails
1660520	1662520	so I can fuck pussy.
1663520	1664520	Shame.
1664520	1665520	Let's talk about the shame.
1665520	1667520	Before I was transgendered,
1667520	1669520	I really only dated women,
1669520	1671520	though two of those women
1671520	1673520	later turned out to be trans,
1673520	1674520	so I guess we had some way
1674520	1675520	of finding each other.
1675520	1676520	An attraction to women
1676520	1678520	was never really a problem for me
1678520	1680520	before the transgendering
1680520	1681520	because I was raised
1681520	1682520	in an alternative lifestyle
1682520	1684520	where men are supposed
1684520	1685520	to be attracted to women.
1685520	1686520	Crazy, I know.
1686520	1687520	Not that I'm a newcomer to shame,
1687520	1690520	because, oh, sweaty?
1690520	1691520	I was doing plenty of things
1691520	1693520	that men are not supposed to do.
1693520	1694520	Before I transitioned,
1694520	1696520	my shame was centered around
1696520	1697520	my being, at the time,
1697520	1699520	a gender nonconforming man,
1699520	1701520	which, in my early YouTube videos,
1701520	1703520	I dealt with by caricaturing myself
1703520	1705520	and basically leaning in
1705520	1707520	to the public humiliation.
1707520	1709520	One of my classic techniques.
1709520	1711520	But now, my shame is centered around
1711520	1713520	my failure to be a socially acceptable woman.
1713520	1715520	And the most glaring aspects
1715520	1717520	of that failure are
1717520	1718520	my male past,
1718520	1720520	my sexual orientation,
1720520	1722520	and the severed human heads
1722520	1723520	in my refrigerator.
1723520	1725520	Yeah, killing all those people
1725520	1727520	was not my most feminine moment,
1727520	1729520	but I was having a bad skin day.
1729520	1730520	What was I supposed to do?
1730520	1731520	So there's two problems
1731520	1733520	that kind of multiply together.
1733520	1735520	One, I'm ashamed of being trans.
1735520	1738520	Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.
1738520	1741520	And whatever one times two is,
1741520	1743520	I'm really ashamed
1743520	1745520	of being a trans lesbian.
1745520	1746520	Ugh.
1746520	1749520	And it's difficult and risky
1749520	1751520	for me to admit these feelings,
1751520	1753520	because visible queer people
1753520	1755520	are supposed to perform pride.
1755520	1757520	Why is no one talking about the shame?
1757520	1759520	Because we are ashamed of the shame.
1759520	1761520	But we shouldn't be.
1761520	1764520	The shame is a natural result of shaming.
1764520	1766520	I grew up in a media era
1766520	1768520	when trans women were usually represented
1768520	1770520	as vomit-inducing monstrosities
1770520	1771520	who deserve the violence
1771520	1773520	they bring upon themselves by existing.
1773520	1774520	And I started my transition
1774520	1776520	in the first year of the Trump administration
1776520	1778520	when there's been constant vilification
1778520	1780520	of trans people in the press.
1780520	1781520	Invading women's bathrooms,
1781520	1783520	forcing our insanity on children,
1783520	1785520	destroying Western civilization
1785520	1787520	with our authoritarian pronouns.
1787520	1788520	It's hard to express just
1788520	1790520	the daily humiliation
1790520	1792520	of being a trans woman under these conditions.
1792520	1794520	And then there's the little jabs people throw at you,
1794520	1797520	like my laser technician recently told me,
1797520	1799520	you must be very courageous to transition
1799520	1802520	because that is not socially acceptable.
1802520	1804520	And then she went back to blasting laser beams
1804520	1805520	into my asshole.
1805520	1806520	And then there's the internet,
1806520	1807520	where, you know,
1807520	1809520	I used to spend most of my life
1809520	1810520	before the sadness took over.
1810520	1811520	And I'm sure we all know
1811520	1812520	that people on the internet
1812520	1814520	are a wretched, wretched horde
1814520	1816520	of bigoted attack helicopters.
1816520	1817520	The whole point of this channel
1817520	1819520	is I try to talk sense to these people.
1819520	1821520	I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives
1821520	1823520	and I try to empathize with their point of view
1823520	1825520	and provide a rational response.
1825520	1827520	But a side effect of all that research
1827520	1829520	is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary
1829520	1830520	of self-loathing.
1830520	1832520	It's seeped into my brain
1832520	1834520	and become a part of me.
1834520	1836520	And this lifelong buildup of shame
1836520	1837520	has become a wound
1837520	1839520	at the heart of my existence.
1839520	1841520	And all I can really do about it is
1841520	1844520	compensate by wearing fancy clothes.
1844520	1845520	I may be trash,
1845520	1847520	but I am a genius.
1847520	1849520	I am majestic trash.
1849520	1851520	I am resplendent trash.
1851520	1852520	I am couture trash.
1852520	1854520	And I just bought
1854520	1856520	a mid-century gold-trimmed
1856520	1859520	Venetian blown glass decanter,
1859520	1860520	which helps me forget
1860520	1861520	the shame and self-loathing
1861520	1863520	that plagues my every moment.
1863520	1864520	Now, I'm guessing
1864520	1866520	that a lot of people will be confused
1866520	1868520	about why I'm so ashamed of being gay
1868520	1870520	when I've already come out as trans,
1870520	1872520	which seems like a bigger deal.
1872520	1874520	To paraphrase what some people have told me,
1874520	1876520	you're already a transgendered
1876520	1877520	and a freak's a freak,
1877520	1879520	so who cares what kind of freak?
1879520	1880520	Well, first of all,
1880520	1881520	I would like to propose
1881520	1883520	a sociological theory.
1883520	1884520	Tiffany's Law.
1884520	1885520	All freaks
1885520	1887520	have a deep psychological need
1887520	1888520	to feel superior
1888520	1890520	to a different type of freak.
1890520	1891520	And trans lesbians
1891520	1893520	are pretty close to the bottom
1893520	1894520	of that packing order.
1894520	1895520	Who's even left for me
1895520	1896520	to feel superior to?
1896520	1897520	The goddamn Belgians?
1897520	1899520	Fuck this waffle.
1899520	1900520	Second,
1900520	1901520	coming out as trans
1901520	1902520	wasn't as hard for me
1902520	1903520	because I did it incrementally
1903520	1905520	over like eight years.
1905520	1906520	At first,
1906520	1907520	I was like,
1907520	1908520	well,
1908520	1909520	I'm just a man
1909520	1910520	who wears makeup sometimes.
1910520	1911520	Then I was like,
1911520	1912520	actually,
1912520	1913520	it's not just clothes and makeup.
1913520	1914520	I'm actually pretty gender nonconforming
1914520	1915520	in a lot of ways.
1915520	1916520	And then I realized
1916520	1917520	I'm not a man at all
1917520	1918520	and I identified as nonbinary.
1918520	1920520	Then I started taking hormones.
1920520	1921520	In two months on HRT,
1921520	1923520	I woke up one day and said,
1923520	1924520	it's fine.
1924520	1925520	I am literally a woman.
1925520	1926520	So by the time
1926520	1927520	I actually came out
1927520	1928520	as a trans woman,
1928520	1930520	that was actually a step up
1930520	1931520	in terms of social acceptability
1931520	1933520	from where I was before.
1933520	1934520	When I was a genderqueer genderfuck,
1934520	1935520	I felt like
1935520	1936520	I didn't fit in anywhere.
1936520	1937520	Whereas
1937520	1938520	when I started transitioning
1938520	1939520	to female,
1939520	1940520	even though at first
1940520	1941520	I had a lot of the same problems,
1941520	1942520	there was at least
1942520	1944520	a goal in mind,
1944520	1946520	some possible future
1946520	1947520	where I could lead
1947520	1948520	a normal-ish life as a woman.
1948520	1949520	So the moment
1949520	1950520	I started identifying
1950520	1951520	as a woman
1951520	1952520	was the moment
1952520	1953520	the compet voice
1953520	1954520	entered my head.
1954520	1955520	Sure,
1955520	1956520	I've never been very attracted
1956520	1957520	to men before,
1957520	1958520	but maybe I'm attracted
1958520	1959520	to them now.
1959520	1960520	I'm a woman, right?
1960520	1961520	I've always been
1961520	1962520	a little bi-curious
1962520	1963520	and there was that time
1963520	1964520	I kissed a boy
1964520	1965520	when I was drunk.
1965520	1966520	Let's choose some boys
1966520	1967520	to be attracted to
1967520	1968520	and get started on this.
1968520	1969520	Of course,
1969520	1970520	I wasn't as self-aware
1970520	1971520	as that.
1971520	1972520	My way of explaining it
1972520	1973520	to myself was,
1973520	1974520	I guess,
1974520	1975520	hormones just magically
1975520	1976520	changed my sexual orientation
1976520	1977520	to the socially acceptable one.
1977520	1978520	That's super friggin crazy.
1978520	1979520	Shut up,
1979520	1980520	you goddamn lesbo.
1980520	1981520	God,
1981520	1982520	there's so much pressure
1982520	1983520	on trans women
1983520	1984520	to be extremely
1984520	1985520	gender conforming,
1985520	1986520	and even more so
1986520	1987520	if you're a representative
1987520	1988520	of the community.
1988520	1989520	You feel like
1989520	1990520	you have to be
1990520	1991520	a Stepford wife
1991520	1992520	or else cis people
1992520	1993520	are gonna throw us all
1993520	1994520	in camps.
1994520	1995520	And early in my transition,
1995520	1996520	I kind of worshipped
1996520	1997520	straight trans women.
1997520	1998520	Like,
1998520	1999520	I looked up to them
1999520	2000520	and I wanted to be
2000520	2001520	just like them.
2001520	2002520	Now back then,
2002520	2003520	there were a handful
2003520	2004520	of trans lesbians
2004520	2005520	on YouTube
2005520	2006520	trying to make the case
2006520	2007520	to the masses
2007520	2008520	that being a trans lesbian
2008520	2009520	is a legitimate thing.
2009520	2010520	But in 2017,
2010520	2011520	sweaty,
2011520	2012520	the masses
2012520	2013520	were not having it.
2013520	2014520	I watched those women
2014520	2015520	get eaten alive.
2015520	2016520	And as a result
2016520	2017520	of my witnessing that
2017520	2018520	at a super fucking
2018520	2019520	vulnerable moment for me,
2019520	2021520	I internalized the message
2021520	2023520	that a trans lesbian
2023520	2024520	is just
2024520	2025520	not an okay
2025520	2026520	thing to be
2026520	2027520	if you want to be tolerated
2027520	2028520	or respected
2028520	2029520	by anybody other than
2029520	2030520	a handful of communists.
2030520	2031520	So I began my transition
2031520	2032520	with essentially
2032520	2033520	no role model
2033520	2034520	of a widely respected
2034520	2035520	and admired
2035520	2036520	trans lesbian.
2036520	2037520	And it doesn't help
2037520	2038520	that most forms
2038520	2039520	of transphobia
2039520	2040520	are harsher
2040520	2041520	on gay trans women
2041520	2042520	than they are
2042520	2043520	on straight trans women.
2043520	2044520	Like take this trope
2044520	2045520	that trans women
2045520	2046520	are men
2046520	2047520	who transition
2047520	2048520	to creep on women
2048520	2049520	in bathrooms.
2049520	2050520	In response to that,
2050520	2051520	it feels really good
2051520	2052520	to be able to say
2052520	2053520	I'm not even attracted
2053520	2054520	to this petite
2054520	2055520	heterosexual bio girl.
2055520	2056520	I'm surely not
2056520	2057520	some kind of
2057520	2058520	six foot monster
2058520	2059520	who likes women.
2059520	2060520	Shame.
2061520	2062520	Shame.
2062520	2063520	It does make me feel
2063520	2064520	like a monster sometimes,
2064520	2065520	like a mutant
2065520	2066520	that has no place
2066520	2067520	in society.
2067520	2068520	And this shame
2068520	2069520	has actually made it
2069520	2070520	more difficult
2070520	2071520	for me to accept
2071520	2072520	that I'm a gay woman
2072520	2073520	than it was for me
2073520	2074520	to come out as trans
2074520	2075520	in the first place.
2075520	2076520	It's like I made
2076520	2077520	a kind of subconscious
2077520	2078520	bargain
2078520	2079520	where I traded
2079520	2080520	my sexual orientation
2080520	2081520	for my gender identity.
2081520	2082520	So I finally transitioned
2082520	2083520	only to spend
2083520	2084520	a different kind
2084520	2085520	of denial.
2085520	2086520	And that denial
2086520	2087520	got pretty deep
2087520	2088520	and pretty dark.
2088520	2089520	This is painful
2089520	2090520	and incriminating
2090520	2091520	to admit,
2091520	2092520	but not all of my shame
2092520	2093520	came from external bigotry.
2093520	2094520	Some of it came
2094520	2095520	from my own judgment
2095520	2096520	and disgust
2096520	2097520	toward things
2097520	2098520	I saw trans lesbians
2098520	2099520	doing.
2099520	2100520	Like this anime
2100520	2101520	cat girl shit
2101520	2102520	which clearly
2102520	2103520	gets under my skin
2103520	2104520	and not just because
2104520	2105520	these people
2105520	2106520	have been harassing me
2106520	2107520	for three years.
2107520	2108520	Like you see it
2108520	2109520	all over trans Twitter
2109520	2110520	and Reddit,
2110520	2111520	this queasy combination
2111520	2112520	of the hypersexual
2112520	2113520	and the infantile.
2113520	2114520	I'm a heckin'
2114520	2115520	cat girl lesbian
2115520	2116520	cum slut.
2116520	2117520	Meow meow,
2117520	2118520	girl dick,
2118520	2119520	nya nya.
2119520	2120520	Here's the 97th picture
2120520	2121520	of my own legs
2121520	2122520	and thigh-high
2122520	2123520	stripey socks uwu.
2123520	2124520	What is that about?
2124520	2126520	Is this how women act?
2126520	2127520	Cis people are gonna
2127520	2128520	see this.
2128520	2129520	They're not gonna
2129520	2130520	let us into women's spaces
2130520	2131520	if we act like that.
2131520	2132520	Now I'm not proud
2132520	2133520	of having these
2133520	2134520	judgmental feelings,
2134520	2135520	but I confess
2135520	2136520	to periodically
2136520	2137520	sinking into
2137520	2138520	these morbid
2138520	2139520	guilty binges
2139520	2140520	of cringing
2140520	2141520	at embarrassing
2141520	2142520	trans lesbians
2142520	2143520	and if I was
2143520	2144520	a different type
2144520	2145520	of YouTuber
2145520	2146520	I could've turned
2146520	2147520	this into content.
2147520	2148520	At my worst
2148520	2149520	I would sit there
2149520	2150520	telling another
2150520	2151520	trans person
2151520	2152520	why are trans lesbians
2152520	2153520	so cringey
2153520	2154520	they're making things
2154520	2155520	harder for the rest
2155520	2156520	of us girls.
2156520	2157520	And that's
2157520	2158520	the real darkness
2158520	2159520	isn't it?
2159520	2160520	Not even having
2160520	2161520	the decency
2161520	2162520	to openly
2162520	2163520	despise yourself
2163520	2164520	like an honest American.
2164520	2165520	No,
2165520	2166520	just sitting there
2166520	2167520	in absurd denial
2167520	2168520	of who you are
2168520	2169520	as a person
2169520	2170520	disparaging
2170520	2171520	your own repressed
2171520	2172520	identity to anyone
2172520	2173520	I'm ashamed
2173520	2174520	I sunk that low
2174520	2175520	but all you can do
2175520	2176520	is try to get better
2176520	2177520	and I'm trying
2177520	2178520	to get better
2178520	2179520	I've broken free
2179520	2180520	of the denial
2180520	2181520	and now I have
2181520	2182520	to break free
2182520	2183520	of the shame
2183520	2184520	because shame
2184520	2185520	is literally
2185520	2186520	ruining my life.
2186520	2187520	I told Joanne
2187520	2188520	I was working
2188520	2189520	on a video
2189520	2190520	about shame
2190520	2191520	and she said
2191520	2192520	I might want
2192520	2193520	to mention
2193520	2194520	that one of the reasons
2194520	2195520	she didn't want
2195520	2196520	to be with me
2196520	2197520	is she'd be ashamed
2197520	2198520	to date another
2198520	2199520	trans woman.
2199520	2200520	She said she feels
2200520	2201520	like relationships
2201520	2202520	are a freakish behavior
2202520	2203520	on the outskirts
2203520	2204520	of society
2204520	2205520	with no attempt
2205520	2206520	to integrate.
2206520	2207520	These are very painful
2207520	2208520	words to hear
2208520	2209520	from the woman
2209520	2210520	you're in love with
2210520	2211520	but I understand
2211520	2212520	why she feels
2212520	2213520	that way.
2213520	2214520	Joanne gets validation
2214520	2215520	from dating cis men
2215520	2216520	or cis women
2216520	2217520	but I
2217520	2218520	can't be the hinge
2218520	2219520	that connects her
2219520	2220520	to mainstream society
2220520	2221520	and it's maddening
2221520	2222520	to me that she feels
2222520	2223520	that way
2223520	2224520	because I would have
2224520	2225520	chosen her
2225520	2226520	over every cis woman
2226520	2227520	in the world
2227520	2228520	but I'm just another
2228520	2229520	worthless freak
2229520	2230520	without the authority
2230520	2231520	of my love
2231520	2232520	doesn't count.
2232520	2233520	Shame.
2233520	2234520	It poisons
2234520	2235520	the soul.
2235520	2236520	You know who you love
2236520	2237520	just like what gender
2237520	2238520	you are
2238520	2239520	is such a basic
2239520	2240520	part of your humanity
2240520	2241520	and shame
2241520	2242520	about that
2242520	2243520	cuts to the core
2243520	2244520	of your being.
2244520	2245520	It's not
2245520	2246520	I'm ashamed
2246520	2247520	of what I did
2247520	2248520	it's not
2248520	2249520	I'm ashamed
2249520	2250520	of how I feel
2250520	2251520	it's I'm ashamed
2251520	2252520	of who and what
2252520	2253520	I am
2253520	2254520	and living
2254520	2255520	in that state of mind
2255520	2256520	is garbage
2256520	2257520	it's basically
2257520	2258520	hell.
2258520	2259520	Even after I realized
2259520	2260520	my sexuality
2260520	2261520	shoving that shit
2261520	2262520	back down
2262520	2263520	never coming out
2263520	2264520	I have all these
2264520	2265520	fears about it
2265520	2266520	I'm worried
2266520	2267520	people will take my gender
2267520	2268520	less seriously
2268520	2269520	I'm worried
2269520	2270520	cis women
2270520	2271520	or straight women
2271520	2272520	I'm friends with
2272520	2273520	will get weird about it
2273520	2274520	I'm worried
2274520	2275520	I'll die a lonely
2275520	2276520	useless lesbian
2276520	2277520	in which case
2277520	2278520	I should have just
2278520	2279520	married a man
2279520	2280520	cause at least then
2280520	2281520	there'd be someone
2281520	2282520	to kill the spiders
2282520	2283520	and fix the fucking sink
2283520	2284520	I'm worried
2284520	2285520	I'll lose my straight male
2285520	2286520	audience on YouTube
2286520	2287520	although
2287520	2288520	I mean
2288520	2289520	love you boys
2289520	2290520	I'll be fine
2290520	2291520	without you
2291520	2292520	and in any case
2292520	2293520	when has a woman's
2293520	2294520	being a lesbian
2294520	2295520	ever stopped a man
2295520	2296520	from taking a swing at it
2296520	2297520	I actually thought about
2297520	2298520	marrying a man anyway
2298520	2299520	just sacrificing
2299520	2300520	my sexual orientation
2300520	2301520	to regain
2301520	2302520	that safe
2302520	2303520	comfortable
2303520	2304520	shameless
2304520	2305520	feeling
2305520	2306520	I used to have
2306520	2307520	when walking down the street
2307520	2308520	holding Chad's hand
2308520	2309520	feeling like I'd succeeded
2309520	2310520	as a woman
2310520	2311520	but if I don't deal
2311520	2312520	with this now
2312520	2313520	and work towards
2313520	2314520	accepting myself
2314520	2315520	then I'm just gonna be
2315520	2316520	in the same situation
2316520	2317520	in 10 years
2317520	2318520	when I'm 41 years old
2318520	2319520	and married to a man
2319520	2320520	with the same feelings
2320520	2321520	so it's time for this
2321520	2322520	to stop
2322520	2323520	because literally
2323520	2324520	the only good thing
2324520	2325520	about being gay
2325520	2326520	is doing gay shit
2326520	2327520	and as long as I'm ashamed
2327520	2328520	of my sexuality
2328520	2329520	no one's gonna wanna
2329520	2330520	do gay shit with me
2330520	2331520	as I like to say
2331520	2332520	if you can't love yourself
2332520	2333520	how in the hell
2333520	2334520	are you gonna prop up
2334520	2335520	your narcissistic delusions
2335520	2336520	look I'm trying
2336520	2337520	to stay positive
2337520	2338520	maybe everyone hates
2338520	2339520	trans lesbians now
2339520	2340520	but just you wait
2340520	2341520	we all know
2341520	2342520	how trends work
2342520	2343520	in 10 years
2343520	2344520	being a trans lesbian
2344520	2345520	will be the coolest
2345520	2346520	hippest
2346520	2347520	chicest
2347520	2348520	thing imaginable
2348520	2349520	and all the people
2349520	2350520	who love it now
2350520	2351520	will forget
2351520	2352520	they ever said a word
2352520	2353520	that's right
2353520	2354520	even the straight trans girls
2354520	2355520	will be making out
2355520	2356520	with each other
2356520	2357520	just for the clout
2357520	2358520	like we can be lesbians
2358520	2359520	too
2359520	2360520	we are edgy
2360520	2361520	oh
2361520	2362520	it's gonna be
2362520	2363520	Madonna and Britney
2363520	2364520	at the 2003 VMAs
2364520	2365520	all over again
2365520	2366520	mark my words
2366520	2367520	and among cis lesbians
2367520	2368520	oh
2368520	2369520	it will actually be
2369520	2370520	a sign of prestige
2370520	2372520	to have a trap waifu
2372520	2373520	I can dream right
2373520	2374520	once you've tasted
2374520	2375520	one forbidden fruit
2375520	2376520	why stop there
2379520	2380520	because they'll be
2380520	2381520	fine
2381520	2382520	oh my god
2382520	2383460	you've got a bomb
2383460	2383520	nggak
2383520	2384520	nothing can stop
2384520	2385520	me
2385520	2386520	gotta go
2386520	2387520	you only do
2387520	2388520	what you gotta do
