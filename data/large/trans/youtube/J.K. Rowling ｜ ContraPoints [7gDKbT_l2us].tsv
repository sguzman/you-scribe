400	2800	Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble.
6160	7280	Fireborn and cauldron bubble.
10880	16800	Something wicked this way comes. Magical deeds are afoot, dear readers. Magical darkness.
20080	20800	A must.
23440	25680	Joanne, I want to talk to you, Joanne.
25680	31440	What is it about Joannes? I can't catch a break from these people.
31440	37280	So now that 2020 is finally over, I think we can let the record conclusively show
37840	42400	that it was a year homest is bad. And on top of everything else that was going on,
42400	46880	truly the last thing we needed was the author of Harry Potter coming forward to announce
46880	52800	there's two things she can't stand. Bigotry and the transgenders. Ow.
53600	54640	Elderberry wand.
55840	57920	Turgid. With a core of…
59760	61680	Ice dragon. Lumos.
61680	63920	Can we afford spells? Is that in the budget?
63920	65200	Expecto Patreon.
65920	69920	So you've probably heard by now about Joanne Rowling's transphobic tweets.
69920	74160	Unless you've been living under a rock, in which case, get back under that rock,
74160	78560	sweetie, there is nothing good going on up here, it's not worth it. Or maybe you heard that all
78560	85440	Joanne did was say biological sex is real, and now crazy gender ideologues and trans activists are
85440	91680	trying to silence her. This is cancel culture gone too far. This is a witch hunt. Celebrities are
91680	97200	under attack. This is the new Salem. This is Orwell's nightmare. This is a painful topic for
97200	104080	me all around, because as a transgender woman, I am honestly hurt by a lot of the things Joanne
104080	109200	has said in the last year. But I also know what it's like to be the target of a Twitter mob.
109200	113600	And I realize that to most people, complaining about being cancelled, it sounds incredible, but
114560	119360	it sounds incredibly whiny and self-absorbed. Like, you'd especially think that rich and
119360	125440	famous people like JK Rowling would be above staying up alone at night reading mean things
125440	131520	people say online. But you'd think wrong. See, you underestimate the fundamental sadness of the
131520	137360	human condition. And no amount of fame and money is gonna fix that. You know, fame alienates you
137360	143360	from other people. It dehumanizes you in the eyes of the masses. Which can actually make you feel
143360	148800	more alone, even when people are worshipping you as a goddess. Never mind how it feels when they're
148800	155520	hunting you as a witch. The truth is that unless you've personally experienced infamy, being shamed
155520	160160	and shunned on a scale the human brain can't really even understand, then you just don't know
160160	165840	what it's like. And you don't know how you'd react in that situation. But Joanne knows, and when I
165840	171120	see her getting trashed on the TL, there's a traumatized part of me that's unironically
171120	177120	triggered by watching people cancel her. And I want to protect. My nurturing and compassionate
177120	182400	nature sometimes gets the best of me. But there's also a part of me that wants to join the trashing.
182400	187360	How could you do this to me, Joanne? I did not come out of the cupboard under the stairs for this.
187360	192800	So what I want to do in this video is take Joanne's pain seriously and treat her like a complex human
192800	199840	being, while also being critical of the things she said about the transgender question. And I also
201120	207520	want to know where the Twitter mob is coming from. Because they're in pain too, and don't they also
207520	214960	deserve our understanding? So without further ado, let's go in with a Mac 224 tapered blending brush
214960	219840	and see if we can find the truth. Swish and flick.
231120	236400	So is the author of Harry Potter a bigot? Well, she certainly seems invested in the belief that
236400	243040	she's not a bigot. What vice do you most despise? Bigotry. In looking over Joanne's tweets,
243040	247680	I don't think the average person would see any problem with what she said. However,
248400	253360	I mean, not to be condescending, but I feel like the average person's understanding of
253360	259760	transgender is still a little bit... I don't really get the whole trans thing. Like,
261120	268080	why don't you just be a feminine man? I don't know, Amber. Why don't you be a feminine man?
268080	272000	Who knows, you could be missing out. So we're going to go through the things that Joanne has
272000	277600	said about trans people, but I don't want this to be just a drama video or a video saying,
277600	283120	cancel Harry Potter, drag her. Like, I want to try to do something a little bit more meaningful
283120	290320	than that. So I'm going to use J.K. Rowe as a case study in bigotry and see if we can maybe learn
290320	291120	something about
291120	296880	what bigotry is, how does it work, and how do otherwise good people get drawn into it.
296880	301280	And if we can make any progress on any of those questions, well, for once I think I'll actually
301280	306480	have earned my Patreon budget. So keeping in mind our very serious and educational purpose,
307360	309840	let's spill some shade, throw some tea.
310960	316480	So this all started in 2018 when Joanne liked a transphobic tweet and followed an
316480	321040	anti-trans account. Now in the interest of giving Joanne as much benefit of the doubt as I can,
321120	325680	I'm not going to admit this as evidence because I don't want to do guilt by association.
325680	326800	Strike it from the record.
327600	329360	That was fun. I like hammering things.
331120	335840	The real story begins in December 2019 when Joanne tweeted the hashtag
335840	338880	I stand with Maya, referencing Maya Forstater.
338880	343920	Maya Forstater is an English consultant who lost her contract with the non-profit she worked for
343920	349600	after she did transphobic tweets. And Maya has been kind enough to compile them all for us in her
349600	350320	thread titled,
350320	353120	Allegedly Transphobic Tweets.
353120	357040	Well, let's take a look and see how alleged they are.
357040	361360	Yes, I think that male people are not women. I don't think that being a woman or female
361360	365120	is a matter of identity or womanly feelings. It is biology.
365120	366240	Another says,
366240	371680	Some people believe that a person with a penis can be a woman. Some, a majority, don't.
371680	376080	Neither group should be discriminated against in everyday life, but in situations involving
376080	380320	taking your clothes off with strangers, integration of the two groups is not possible.
380320	384960	And there's a cartoon of a hairy-armed, hairy-legged, burgeoning trans woman
384960	387600	flashing her penis at cis women and saying,
387600	390000	It's alright, it's a woman's penis.
390560	393680	So we're looking at a standard transphobia starter pack.
393680	397360	Everyone born female is a woman, everyone born male is a man,
397360	402720	trans women are predators who prey on women, and I'm being oppressed for speaking the truth.
402720	406960	Is this what you want, Joanne? You want to put the sorting hat on humanity and divide us up into
406960	410160	little houses? Well, what if I'm a Gryffindor trapped in a Hufflepuff's box?
410160	413280	What then, Joanne? What then?
413280	418480	Okay, so why does Joanne stand with Maya? Well, if the tweet simply said I stand with
418480	422720	Maya without further explanation, you could give her the benefit of the doubt.
422720	426880	Maybe she just doesn't think people should lose their job for having bigoted opinions,
426880	428800	even if she disagrees with those opinions.
428800	433200	But if that's all she was saying, I wouldn't be making this video, would I?
433200	434640	The full tweet reads,
434640	440080	Dress however you please. Call yourself whatever you like. Sleep with any consenting adult.
440160	444160	Live your best life in peace and security.
444160	448320	But force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.
448320	451440	Hashtag I stand with Maya. Hashtag this is not a drill.
451440	457120	Now, I'm guessing that to most people, this tweet at first glance doesn't seem transphobic.
457120	461920	It might even seem supportive of trans people since she said we're allowed to dress however
461920	467360	we want and call ourselves whatever crazy thing. But there's a couple of things about this that
467360	469840	don't sit right with me. First is the phrase,
470160	474720	force women out of their jobs for stating that sex is real.
474720	481520	Sex is real is a pretty dishonest summary of what Maya said in her discrimination complaint, namely,
481520	485200	I believe that it is impossible to change your sex or to lose your sex.
485200	489840	Girls grow up to be women, boys grow up to be men. No change of clothes or hairstyle,
489840	494800	no plastic surgery, no accident or illness, no course of hormones, no force of will or
494800	500000	social conditioning, no declaration, can turn a female person into a male or a male person into
500000	505440	a female. If Joanne had said Maya had been fired for claiming that a person born male could never
505440	511040	be a woman and a person born female could never be a man, that would have been more accurate.
511040	515200	But it would also sound contentious and obviously anti-trans.
515200	520800	Sex is real is a euphemism designed to present Maya Forstater's transphobia as a simple
520800	527280	statement of fact, basic common sense, which only crazy activists and ideologues would oppose.
527280	529520	Transphobes love to play this game where they
529520	534320	pretend that trans people just don't understand basic biology. That's our problem.
534320	538160	As if I didn't start taking female hormones because I'm acutely aware
538160	542560	that my body is not the same as a cis woman's body. That sex is real.
542560	548320	You will never be a woman, Nathan. Every cell in your body is male and has a Y chromosome.
549200	552960	Really? That's crazy. How'd you learn so much about science?
552960	557040	You know, I don't really feel the need to have a second X chromosome. I get by with one.
557040	558160	I make it work.
558160	559440	I actually like the Y chromosome.
559520	564880	I think it's a little more dainty, you know? It's a little softer, a little more petite.
564880	568640	The X chromosome has a lot of extra appendages, don't you think?
568640	570960	And I don't need any more of those, thanks.
570960	574480	No trans person thinks it's possible to change chromosomal sex,
574480	577360	and to pretend otherwise is to argue in bad faith.
577360	580400	When we say that someone is a trans man or a trans woman,
580400	583120	we're talking about psychological and social identity.
583120	588720	So when transphobes say sex is real, they're not actually contradicting anything most trans people
588720	589360	believe.
589760	591360	Except by implication.
591360	597040	When transphobes say sex is real, what they mean is only chromosomal sex matters.
597040	600160	They mean they don't believe in transgender identity,
600160	603360	which they trivialize, calling it dressing up.
603360	604640	Fashion choices.
604640	606800	Whatever you wanna call yourself.
606800	612400	When Joanne says, dress however you please, call yourself whatever you like,
612400	617760	she's belittling what it actually means to be trans, reducing it to a change of name and costume.
617760	619200	It's similar to the language of cashmere.
619200	624400	For example, the homophobic equivalent of Joanne's tweet might read,
624400	626880	Choose whatever lifestyle you want.
626880	632480	Indulge your sexual preferences with any consenting adult in the privacy of your own bedroom.
632480	638000	But force Christians out of their jobs for stating that marriage is between a man and a woman?
638000	640640	Hashtag I stand with Kim Davis.
640640	644320	A penis and a sausage cannot make a baby.
644320	646080	Checkmate, the gays.
646080	647840	It's just science.
647840	648680	Homophobes trivially say that sex is real.
648680	650600	Trivialize what it is to be gay.
650600	653400	They refer to it as sexual preferences.
653400	655080	Or a lifestyle.
655080	657480	Or what you do in the bedroom.
657480	660200	We don't tell straight people to keep their lifestyle in the bedroom.
661160	662120	But we should.
662120	664600	Clearly, the straights are not oppressed enough.
664600	668120	Being gay is more than what you do in the bedroom.
668120	670600	It's also who you love.
670600	672120	It's part of who you are.
672120	673320	Part of your humanity.
673320	676760	And that's something that stays with you outside of the bedroom.
676760	678360	So to dismiss it as sexual,
678360	680280	or sexual preferences,
680280	681560	is homophobic.
681560	686040	Likewise, being trans is not a costume I take off at the end of the night.
686040	688120	It's not a fashion choice.
688120	691320	It's not a pet name some people call me.
691320	694200	It's part of who I am as a person, you know?
694200	695960	It's part of my humanity.
695960	698040	And it's also the kind of body I have.
698040	699720	A transsexual body.
699720	702680	So telling trans people to dress however you want
702680	705480	is not really a supportive statement.
705480	708200	Unless you're supporting YouTubers wearing Louis Vuitton's...
708360	711400	socks in their videos apologizing for being racist,
711400	713080	which is not valid,
713080	714440	and is in fact,
714440	715720	a hate crime.
715720	718440	YouTubers are constantly dragging each other because
718440	720680	we see ourselves reflected in the other,
720680	722600	and we can't stand the sight of it.
722600	724440	So after the Maya Forrest daughter tweet,
724440	727560	Joanne was silent about trans people for six months.
727560	730280	But she took up the cause again in June 2019,
730280	732200	first to complain about the use of the phrase
732200	734680	people who menstruate in the title of an article
734680	737480	trying to include trans men and non-binary people
737480	738120	in a discussion of sex.
738120	743080	That same night, presumably in response to her Twitter mentions
743080	745240	being lit up by leftist teenagers who think
745240	748200	Stalin did nothing wrong but Rachel Maddow is a war criminal,
748200	752200	Joanne tweeted a thread again repeating the slogan that sex is real,
752200	752760	adding,
752760	754920	It isn't hate to speak the truth.
754920	758360	And concluding with another backhanded statement of support.
758360	762200	I respect every trans person's right to live any way
762200	764840	that feels authentic and comfortable to them.
764840	767480	I'd march with you if you were discriminated against
767480	768040	on the basis,
768040	770280	if you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans.
770280	774360	If you were discriminated against on the basis of being trans?
775160	775480	If?
776040	779640	Widespread discrimination against trans people is well documented.
779640	782120	In fact, the same week as Joanne's tweet,
782120	785400	the Trump administration removed non-discrimination protections
785400	788200	for trans people in health care and health insurance.
788200	790840	So are you marching with us or not, Joanne?
790840	795080	There's a lot of stuff in these tweets that might seem innocent enough to the average person,
795080	797960	but which to someone who understands bigotry against trans people,
798040	800200	raises a red flag.
800200	802040	Bigotry always has a history.
802040	805880	And in order to understand bigotry, you have to learn that history.
805880	811240	Prejudices are made up of tropes, stereotypes, narratives, arguments,
811240	814600	which we aren't born knowing, we have to learn them.
814600	818120	No one is born thinking that the gays are destroying the family,
818120	820360	or that women are naturally subservient,
820360	823560	or that the Jews are trying to control the world economy.
823560	826120	So if you aren't familiar with these prejudices,
826120	827960	you might not notice anything wrong with them.
827960	829960	He never said he hated the Jews.
829960	835880	He is simply concerned about the over-representation of Jewish people in media and banking.
836600	839560	But if you're aware, woke if you will,
839560	844520	then it kind of rings alarm bells when you hear someone repeating bigoted talking points.
844520	848360	When I see Joanne tweeting about how trans people think sex isn't real,
848360	852440	and they're erasing same-sex attraction, and they're silencing women,
852440	857480	alarm bells are ringing because I recognize these as familiar transphobic talking points.
857960	860920	Specifically, TERF talking points.
860920	864040	TERF means Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminism.
864040	865640	God, are we still talking about this?
865640	867720	I promise, this is the last time.
867720	869960	So TERFism is a...
870520	875560	It's a hate movement that disguises transphobia as feminism.
875560	877240	Bigotry has a history.
877240	882440	The foundational TERF text is feminist professor Janice Raymond's 1979 book
882440	886280	The Transsexual Empire, The Making of the Sh**ty Male,
886280	887960	in which Raymond argues that, quote,
888360	893880	All transsexuals rape women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact,
893880	896600	appropriating this body for themselves.
896600	900200	She claims that trans women are agents of the patriarchy who, quote,
900200	903640	merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women.
903640	907000	This book set the general tone for feminist transphobia,
907000	912760	and I bring this up because I want to give you a sense of how this kind of transphobe talks
912760	915480	when they're not afraid of Twitter backlash.
915480	917320	Typical male narcissist.
917960	925320	Nathan manipulates his cultish audience into thinking he's the victim of the big ol' meanie TERFs.
925320	929400	If you keep calling me Nathan, I'm gonna call you Nigel.
930200	931880	Cheerio, old chap.
932520	934040	Or whatever you people say.
934040	935320	Here's the thing, Nigella.
935320	937720	Bigotry can be mean, yes.
938200	942120	And it usually is, when bigots think they can get away with it.
942520	947160	But it's vital to recognize that being mean is not the essence of bigotry.
947160	947720	Bigotry can be mean.
947720	954480	Bigotry can be hateful, yes, but specifically, bigotry is hate that poses a political threat
954480	955960	to the target group.
955960	961020	The fundamental problem with TERFs is not that they're mean, it's that they're
961020	962020	politically reactionary.
962020	964900	They want to reverse the progress of trans liberation.
964900	970680	In the final chapter of the Transsexual Empire, Raymond lays out her solution to the trans
970680	971680	question, quote,
971680	978000	The problem of transsexualism would be best served by morally mandating it out of existence.
978000	984840	I believe that the elimination of transsexualism is not best achieved by legislation prohibiting
984840	989940	transsexual treatment and surgery, but rather by legislation that limits it.
989940	995880	I would favor restricting the number of hospitals and centers where transsexual surgery could
995880	997100	be performed.
997100	1001660	The kind of counseling, to pass successfully as masculine or feminine,
1001660	1008540	that now reigns in gender identity clinics only reinforces the problem of transsexualism.
1008540	1013320	She goes on to argue for alternative, feminist, consciousness-raising therapies, admitting,
1013320	1019040	I am not so naive as to think that they will make transsexualism disappear overnight, but
1019040	1024940	they would at least pose the existence of a real alternative to be explored and tried.
1024940	1030980	So like homophobes, TERFs have historically advocated a kind of conversion therapy aimed
1030980	1031660	at eliminating transsexualism.
1031660	1034040	transsexual identity and behavior.
1034040	1035980	And like the anti-abortion movement,
1035980	1039080	they recognize it's not yet politically practical
1039080	1041720	to completely make illegal a medical procedure
1041720	1044300	they don't like, so they settle for making it
1044300	1046720	as difficult as possible to get one.
1046720	1049480	In 1980, Janice Raymond authored a report
1049480	1051480	to the Department of Health and Human Services
1051480	1053980	repeating her arguments against transsexualism,
1053980	1056320	which was cited in the 1981 decision
1056320	1059660	that Medicare would not cover transition-related healthcare.
1059660	1061460	That decision wasn't overturned
1061460	1064980	until 2014, so there's real political consequences
1064980	1067920	to bigotry, it's not just a matter of being mean.
1067920	1070920	Polite bigotry can be just as dangerous.
1070920	1075020	Unlike Janice Raymond, J.K. Rowling seems totally convinced,
1075020	1077560	and very intent on convincing all of us,
1077560	1080920	that she's a totally progressive LGBT ally
1080920	1083380	who loves and supports trans people,
1083380	1087240	while in the same breath, spewing transphobic arguments.
1087240	1089200	She's constantly saying things like,
1089200	1091200	"'I know and love trans people
1091200	1094920	"'but I'd march with you if you were discriminated against
1094920	1098400	"'on the basis of being trans at the same time.'"
1098400	1100420	None of the gender-critical women I've talked to
1100420	1103160	hates trans people, on the contrary.
1103160	1105040	Many of them became interested in this issue
1105040	1108340	in the first place out of concern for trans youth.
1108340	1110240	A lot of people have a hard time noticing
1110240	1113460	this kind of bigotry, and I think one reason for that
1113460	1116880	is that our common understanding of bigotry is very narrow.
1116880	1119980	People think of bigotry as like judging a group
1119980	1121040	instead of an individual.
1121040	1121180	People think of bigotry as like judging a group instead of an individual.
1121180	1121560	people think of bigotry as like judging a group instead of an individual.
1121560	1124380	Which is, of course, a horrible thing to do.
1124380	1126080	I don't care for the English.
1126080	1128420	They're sick, sick people.
1128420	1131000	Or people think of bigotry as hate,
1131000	1133140	something inhuman and monstrous.
1133140	1135200	So when people hear the word bigot,
1135200	1138720	they're expecting someone like Lord Voldemort,
1138720	1142660	some uber-Nazi who despises love and friendship.
1142660	1144800	But the problem with the Nazis was
1144800	1147080	not that they hated love and friendship, right?
1147080	1150760	They believed they were defending German blood and soil
1150760	1154860	against Marxist-Bolshevism and Jewish contamination.
1154860	1156720	And what were we supposed to do?
1156720	1160560	Not defend the Reich against Polish atrocities?
1160560	1162740	That's how a Nazi actually thinks, right?
1162740	1164820	It's not that they hate friendship.
1164820	1166940	No, they have their own internal logic
1166940	1169460	of victimization and self-righteousness.
1169460	1173400	So when you reduce bigotry to a caricature of pure hatred,
1173400	1177320	you obscure that bigotry is a deeply human problem.
1177320	1179040	You know, sometimes people criticize me
1179040	1180600	for empathizing with bigots,
1180600	1184340	but I believe that understanding bigots
1184340	1188120	is the best defense against becoming one yourself.
1188120	1191220	Because when you dehumanize the villains,
1191220	1195280	you become unable to recognize the villain within.
1195280	1196740	How is she, though?
1196740	1199000	She needs a hot toddy is what she needs.
1199000	1201220	Metal straw because I love the environment.
1201220	1203580	I'm so good, I'm really fucking good.
1203580	1206020	The idea that bigotry is simply hate,
1206020	1209780	I call the Westboro Baptist Church theory of bigotry.
1209780	1213020	It's the idea that bigots are people who outright say,
1213020	1215580	we hate you, God hates you,
1215580	1217420	and we're all marching around with signs
1217420	1218920	about how much we hate you.
1218920	1221600	Like the bad guys in that Taylor Swift video.
1221600	1222900	Ugh, Taylor Swift.
1222900	1225140	Everyone wants to be a gay icon now.
1225140	1226360	Well, I don't.
1226360	1228140	I don't want to be a gay icon.
1228140	1230640	I'm just stuck with you people.
1230640	1231480	Just kidding.
1231480	1233800	Shade never made anybody less gay.
1233800	1235980	Uh, this isn't Shade, Taylor.
1235980	1238660	Shade is JK Rowling telling trans people,
1238660	1239580	sleep with an eight.
1239780	1242500	And scenting adult, who will have you.
1242500	1245520	Bigotry is a lot more complicated than just hate.
1245520	1247820	And the video for you need to calm down
1247820	1250720	is just so emblematic of this misconception.
1250720	1253340	Taylor takes this subject of homophobia
1253340	1256720	and turns it into yet another song about haters.
1256720	1258040	But in the real world,
1258040	1261660	backwoods hillbillies stomping around with misspelled signs
1261660	1264000	are not really the problem.
1264000	1267140	The most dangerous bigots are highly sophisticated
1267140	1268700	and powerful people.
1268700	1269540	And yeah,
1269540	1271340	there are still blatant homophobes who say,
1271340	1272620	it's an abomination,
1272620	1274280	these perverts are spreading AIDS,
1274280	1275560	they're destroying the family,
1275560	1276920	they're recruiting children.
1276920	1277760	But these days,
1277760	1279920	it's much more common to hear,
1279920	1282300	of course I love gay people.
1282300	1285660	Some of my best friends struggle with same-sex attraction.
1285660	1289720	But it's not homophobic to not want LGBT ideology
1289720	1293560	promoted in schools to children as young as three years old.
1293560	1297220	Why, it's a full-on assault on religious liberty.
1297220	1299300	And we get convincing homophobe, don't I?
1299540	1302500	There's really two different styles of bigotry.
1302500	1304360	They express the same prejudice,
1304360	1307040	but they're very different in tone.
1307040	1310980	I'll call the two styles direct bigotry and indirect bigotry.
1310980	1313380	Direct bigotry is openly contemptuous.
1313380	1315740	It's a bigotry manifested in slurs
1315740	1319140	and outright discrimination and demonizing the target group
1319140	1322920	and calls for shunning, subordination, or even violence.
1322920	1327920	Whereas indirect bigotry manifests as concern or debate
1328040	1329420	about a host of proxy issues.
1329420	1333540	It's often defensive in tone rather than offensive.
1333540	1336360	Frequently, the claim is that a once-needed liberation movement
1336360	1337860	has now gone too far,
1337860	1340760	but it's now the activists who are the new oppressors
1340760	1342260	who are disturbing law and order
1342260	1344200	with violent and chaotic protests,
1344200	1346760	who are victimizing and silencing innocent people
1346760	1348040	by calling them bigots,
1348040	1349600	who are infiltrating the media
1349600	1351840	and replacing good old-fashioned entertainment
1351840	1354020	with politically correct propaganda.
1354020	1356880	And of course, ordinary people are too intimidated
1356880	1359360	to speak out against it because cancel culture
1359360	1362500	is out of control and free speech is under attack.
1362500	1365280	The direct bigot is always frothing at the mouth,
1365280	1369160	ranting and raving about predators, perverts, invaders,
1369160	1374160	rapists, brutish animals, vermin, rats, roaches, contagions.
1374780	1378920	Whereas the indirect bigot is always defending something,
1378920	1381940	always a knight in shining armor, defending women,
1381940	1384260	defending the children, defending marriage,
1384260	1386580	defending freedom, defending the family,
1386580	1387860	defending our values, defending common sense,
1387860	1388860	defending our values, defending common sense,
1389360	1393060	defending tradition, defending civilization itself,
1394200	1396320	defending God.
1396320	1398680	He's all powerful, but he could really use your help, Mary.
1398680	1399940	I think a lot of people
1399940	1402880	take a borderline heroic view of themselves,
1402880	1406500	and indirect bigotry flatters that self-image.
1406500	1410280	Indirect bigotry often replaces the actual people it targets
1410280	1412920	with some big abstract concept.
1412920	1414480	Instead of Jewish people,
1414480	1417780	they claim to be against Zionist-occupied government.
1417780	1418880	Instead of women,
1418880	1422380	they claim to hate feminazis, or the friend zone.
1422380	1425980	Gay people are depersonified as the gay agenda.
1425980	1430440	Trans people become transgenderism, gender ideology,
1430440	1432360	trans activists.
1432360	1435100	What they're really against is equality,
1435100	1436320	but they don't say that.
1436320	1439020	In fact, they may not even think it.
1439020	1440780	But they tell on themselves
1440780	1443340	when they react with instinctive hostility
1443340	1445640	to anyone who agitates for change.
1445640	1448880	It's not racist to think that Black Lives Matter,
1448880	1450600	or any of their friends,
1450600	1452500	are just a bunch of thugs
1452500	1455380	that shouldn't disrespect the national anthem.
1455380	1457760	A book called The Anatomy of Prejudices
1457760	1460760	by Elizabeth Young Brule really helped me with this video.
1460760	1463360	One of the points she makes is that a lot of the time,
1463360	1465420	bigotry is backlash.
1465420	1468500	Ideologies of desire are, generally,
1468500	1471500	backlashes against movements of equality.
1471500	1473700	They are regressive prejudices
1473700	1476780	that reinstate inequalities and distinctions,
1476780	1478720	when the force of movements for equality,
1478720	1482020	and, often unconsciously, rejected.
1482020	1485780	Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.
1485780	1488680	Bigotry is not just the psychological state
1488680	1490700	of hating a group of people.
1490700	1492560	Bigotry is political.
1492560	1496040	It's a reaction to changing demographics,
1496040	1497860	or to liberation movements,
1497860	1500760	or to changing power relations between groups.
1500760	1504400	A lot of casual misogynists don't exactly hate women
1504400	1506440	in the literal psychological sense.
1506440	1508540	It's more that they feel threatened,
1508540	1513540	by the prospect of the social and political equality of women.
1513540	1516760	In fact, I would argue that feeling threatened
1516760	1520100	is the distinctive psychological experience of bigotry,
1520100	1522660	much more so than feeling hateful.
1522660	1526040	So bigotry is reactive, and it changes,
1526040	1529160	along with the circumstances it's a reaction to.
1529160	1532580	1950s misogyny still has some things in common
1532580	1534180	with 2020s misogyny.
1534180	1536860	For example, a lot of men still feel some need
1536860	1538420	to control women's sexuality,
1538420	1540080	and women's bodies.
1540080	1541640	But it's also changed a lot,
1541640	1545360	as gender relations have shifted in the last 70 years.
1545360	1547300	The idea that women are naturally suited
1547300	1549800	to domestic servitude is a lot less prevalent
1549800	1550760	than it used to be.
1550760	1554180	And transphobia is a prejudice that's getting much louder,
1554180	1555840	because in the last decade,
1555840	1559000	trans liberation has increased our visibility.
1559000	1560940	People are running into us at work now.
1560940	1562920	They're having to use our pronouns.
1562920	1565580	They're seeing us in politics or in media,
1565580	1568140	and not just as laughing stocks or monsters
1568140	1570720	like we used to be, but as actual characters.
1570720	1574380	And a lot of people are not very happy about it.
1574380	1576760	They feel threatened.
1576760	1578920	That must be super fucking hard for you.
1578920	1582960	Prejudice replaces social barriers of another kind.
1582960	1585720	So JK Rowling frames her position as,
1585720	1589260	I am just saying the fact that sex is real.
1589260	1591800	It's not hateful to say a fact.
1591800	1594120	Why is everyone so mad at me?
1594120	1596500	A fact can't be bigoted.
1596500	1597440	And I agree.
1598140	1600060	That a fact cannot be bigoted,
1600060	1604700	but a fact on its own doesn't mean very much.
1604700	1606440	Usually when we discuss facts,
1606440	1609420	we're using those facts to tell a story.
1609420	1614100	And facts can be used to tell bigoted stories.
1614100	1616520	You know, suppose someone tweets the fact
1616520	1619560	that the homicide rate is higher for black Americans
1619560	1621380	than white Americans.
1621380	1622320	I'm gonna ask,
1622320	1626340	what story are you trying to tell with this fact?
1626340	1627760	What political goal are you trying to tell
1627760	1628100	with this fact?
1628100	1629780	trying to support.
1629780	1638060	One way indirect bigotry works is by camouflaging political struggles as intellectual debates.
1638060	1645040	When Joanne says sex is real, she sounds like she's staking out a position in the trans
1645040	1651760	debate, which is then presented as an intellectual conflict about the metaphysics of gender instead
1651760	1657720	of what it really is, which is a political conflict about the social equality of transgender
1657720	1658760	people.
1658760	1663460	And the effectiveness of that strategy is actually a reason I'm not a huge fan of
1663460	1666000	the slogan, trans women are women.
1666000	1670180	And this is just my opinion, I don't speak for any other trans people, but there's
1670180	1672240	a couple things I don't like about it.
1672240	1677240	One is trans men and non-binary people matter just as much as trans women, which you don't
1677240	1682880	as often hear, trans men are men, or non-binary people are...
1684740	1685740	valid?
1685740	1688840	Doesn't really work, does it?
1688840	1694680	The other problem with trans women are women is it tends to invite the response, well what
1694680	1696500	does it even mean to be a woman?
1696500	1698040	Define woman-head.
1698040	1703440	And now you're immediately getting baited into some bullshit semantic debate about what
1703440	1705380	is a real woman.
1705380	1706380	A real woman.
1706380	1708540	How do you know you're a real woman, Amber?
1708540	1712900	What if you're in the Matrix right now, and in the real world you're biologically male?
1712900	1714700	The tables are turned.
1714700	1715700	It doesn't really matter.
1715740	1716740	That's it.
1716740	1720520	This is metaphysics, and life is too short for metaphysics.
1720520	1723980	You know I've been down this road too many times already, and I always end up having
1723980	1729060	these dead-end conversations about gender performativity, or worse, conversations about
1729060	1730740	what it means to feel like a woman.
1730740	1733240	Well the truth is, I don't feel like a woman.
1733240	1739020	I don't think anyone feels like a woman honestly, except a certain sub-genre of gay men, and
1739020	1740860	possibly Shania Twain.
1740860	1744600	Probably not even her anymore honestly, not since the early 2000s.
1744600	1745600	You know some questions?
1745600	1746600	Like, how do you know you're a woman?
1746600	1747600	How do you know you're a woman?
1747600	1748600	It's a very complex question.
1748600	1749600	The only way to answer this should be dissolved rather than solved.
1749600	1750600	That's what Wittgenstein said.
1750600	1751600	That's right, we're dragging Ludwig into this.
1751600	1756840	Sometimes the only way to answer a question is to realize you're asking the wrong question.
1756840	1758980	How do I know I'm a woman?
1758980	1761140	Well look at me.
1761140	1763060	I rest.
1763060	1765520	My case.
1765520	1766840	The monitor's over here.
1766840	1768740	That's what I'm looking at when I look over here.
1768740	1771880	I like to check in occasionally, see how I'm doing.
1771880	1774600	Look trans people can't even agree among ourselves what gender is.
1774600	1775600	No.
1775600	1780040	even try to answer the question, you end up enraging some part of the community who feels
1780040	1785440	excluded. So no, trans people are not trying to force an ideology on people. We don't even share
1785440	1790380	an ideology within our own community. What we share are a common set of political struggles
1790380	1797040	against discrimination, against harassment, against excessive medical gatekeeping, against
1797040	1803660	exclusion from public life. So what would be a better slogan than trans women are women? Well,
1803660	1810440	ideally something that includes all trans people and something that evades pointless philosophizing
1810440	1817500	about biology and what is gender and who is true trans and what is a woman really. Something that
1817500	1822700	centers what actually matters, which is freeing trans people from the stigma and discrimination
1822700	1827940	that have historically prevented us from becoming equal members of society. So I know it sounds kind
1827940	1832880	of outdated, very 1970s, but I personally like the slogan,
1833160	1833640	Trans Living.
1833660	1838920	Liberation now. It's short, it's sweet, and instead of prompting, define womanhood,
1839300	1844680	it prompts people to ask, what do you mean liberation? Liberation from what? And then you
1844680	1850180	can say, well, I'll tell you. And now you're talking about politics instead of talking about
1850180	1855580	semantics. Isn't that better? I feel like trans culture is just so obsessed with reassuring
1855580	1860900	ourselves that we are valid that we sometimes forget that the end goal of a political movement
1860900	1863640	is not validity. It's equality.
1864300	1869100	That's what we're supposed to be fighting for. So instead of asking, does JK Rowling think we're
1869100	1874700	valid? Which like, who fucking cares if she thinks we're valid? Well, maybe I care a little bit. But
1874700	1881000	instead, why don't we ask, is she or is she not an ally in our struggle for equality? Doesn't that
1881000	1886320	just bring reality back into focus? Isn't it so much better to have a concrete political project
1886320	1892220	in front of you instead of sinking into this scholastic gender theology? Trans people are a
1892220	1893540	population of people.
1893660	1899420	Who have a right to equality and to freedom from discrimination. We are not an ideology
1899420	1905600	that's up for debate. But that's how JK Rowling frames the trans question. Not as a struggle
1905600	1912380	for equality that she opposes, but as an ideology that she disagrees with. I'm just saying that
1912380	1916380	sex is real. Is that all you're saying, Joanne?
1923660	1934960	Remember that scene in the Goblet of Fire in the Prefect's bathroom? moaning Myrtle,
1934960	1940520	hey how are you? I wonder if that inspired my love of baths. This bath is actually really nice.
1940520	1946880	It's a lot of milk and a lot of rose oil, Epsom salts. Just kind of everything that's good in baths
1946880	1952060	all together. I don't wanna talk about bigotry. I wanna talk about baths. Can this just be a video
1952060	1953260	about baths from now on? Well, okay that's researched. Guys, we're gonna talk about that lamps. Have
1953260	1953500	a nice day. Bye-bye.
1954460	1959740	oh fine i'll do my job on june 10 jk rowling published an essay to her website which on
1959740	1965020	twitter she titled turf wars which was just awarded the russell prize by the bbc for its
1965660	1970860	brave display of unyielding transphobia i guess the essay is several pages long and outlines her
1970860	1976300	reasons for speaking out on sex and gender issues i refuse to bow down to a movement
1976300	1981740	that i believe is doing demonstrable harm in seeking to erode women as a political and
1981740	1987260	biological class and offering to cover predators like few before it where do i even begin with this
1987260	1996300	one well let's pick some highlights woman is not a costume woman is not an idea in a man's head woman
1996300	2004300	is not a pink brain a liking for jimmy chews or any of the other sexist ideas now somehow touted
2004300	2010620	as progressive oh well my mistake here i was thinking i was a woman it turns out i'm just a
2010620	2011660	man who likes expensive shoes
2011740	2017260	what a whimsical misunderstanding okay well that's it everyone the channel's over thanks
2017260	2021900	for the likes and comments i'm gonna head out now to the uh the jimmy choo store and
2023180	2030540	then i guess i'll cut my tits off joanne joanne this is madness joanne
2030540	2036060	when you throw open the doors of bathrooms and changing rooms to any man who believes or feels
2036060	2041660	he's a woman and as i've said gender confirmation certificates may now be granted without
2041740	2047100	any pre-existing requirements for handshaking places like judging processes or homes Millions
2047100	2051980	have heritage history covering our plight resisting the sexual taboos and abusingsama
2051980	2056860	lynchings in unconscious terms and if they niinro you deny their existence the new opens
2056860	2062380	up the door to any and all men who wish to get introduced so look i understand that some women
2062380	2066940	are anxious about the thought of predators in bathrooms and believe me i don't want to
2066940	2068340	share a bathroom with a predator any more than you do why are all my rose petals on this one side come some of them need to come over here
2068340	2069180	come here i've redistributed the petals socialist icon but this talking point that gender change on legal documents will enable predators to enter relations away from different countries will kill women if you are welcome not a woman that comes into a group would turn women into men's seafood and take men into..."
2069180	2069740	...accutest savings begins to be banished by caused by금 sociaux...
2069740	2075140	documents will enable predators to enter bathrooms it doesn't really make sense because gender
2075140	2080760	policing in public bathrooms doesn't involve legal documents like when was the last time you had to
2080760	2085720	present a gender certificate to gain admittance to a public bathroom this feels like a strangely
2085720	2090900	outdated conversation to be having during pandemic lockdown like imagine using a public bathroom
2090900	2095820	imagine being in public i've been reading this book called female masculinity which is about
2095820	2100500	the experiences of butch women and there's a section here called the bathroom problem which
2100500	2106760	describes how women's bathrooms tend to operate as an area for the enforcement of gender conformity
2106760	2111060	the author jack halberstam who's assigned female at birth and presents masculine
2111060	2117340	describes routinely having security called in him for using the women's bathroom having one's gender
2117340	2122940	challenged in the women's restroom is a frequent occurrence in the lives of many androgynous or
2122940	2125620	masculine women indeed it is so
2125620	2125800	challenging that it's so important to have a feminine bathroom and
2125800	2125820	having a feminine bathroom and having a feminine sangat as well is so important to me because
2125820	2128860	that one wonders whether the category woman,
2128860	2131200	when used to designate public functions,
2131200	2133040	is completely outmoded.
2133040	2135800	Queer literature is littered with references
2135800	2137740	to the bathroom problem,
2137740	2139680	and it would not be an exaggeration
2139680	2143040	to call it a standard feature of the butch narrative.
2143040	2144180	And that's very interesting to me
2144180	2146680	because as a feminine trans woman,
2146680	2148680	I have not once been questioned
2148680	2150240	or had the authorities called on me
2150240	2152080	in a women's public bathroom,
2152080	2154040	and the entire time I've been using them,
2154040	2155860	which is several years now.
2155860	2159620	So when Joanne Rowling, a feminine heterosexual woman,
2159620	2161680	calls for more bathroom policing
2161680	2164480	to protect the lesbians or whatever,
2164480	2166180	it just seems ignorant
2166180	2168540	of the way bathroom policing actually works.
2168540	2170740	Like, is she just so famous
2170740	2172720	that she doesn't use public bathrooms anymore
2172720	2174480	and she forgot how they work?
2174480	2177660	How much could one bathroom entry certificate cost, Michael?
2177660	2178820	$10?
2178820	2181700	Women's bathrooms are policed according to femininity,
2181700	2183160	not chromosomes,
2183160	2184020	and there's no practical reason
2184020	2185040	for people to change that
2185040	2188440	short of stationing a genital inspector in every stall,
2188440	2191660	you know, just to make sure no one's privacy is violated.
2191660	2196400	That's a very good idea, Joanne.
2196400	2199260	That's very good.
2199260	2201140	Ironically, radical feminists
2201140	2202900	aren't even trans-exclusionary.
2202900	2205380	They include trans men in their feminism
2205380	2207560	because they were born women.
2207560	2211820	Isn't it ironic that supposedly transphobic feminists
2211820	2213840	think that trans men are women?
2213840	2217640	Hello, operator, could you get me Alanis Morissette?
2217640	2219740	I have a new incident to report.
2219740	2223080	So look, I could keep refuting points made in Turf Wars,
2223080	2224400	which is basically just a series
2224400	2226000	of common transphobic canards
2226000	2227660	we've all heard a hundred times before,
2227660	2230520	but I want to focus in particular on some passages
2230520	2231920	that I think are very revealing
2231920	2234080	about the psychology of transphobia.
2234080	2236240	What is it about the transgenders
2236240	2238500	that some people feel threatened by?
2238500	2241180	Well, Joanne Rowling gives us a lot to work with
2241180	2242600	in answering that question.
2242600	2243840	You know, Joanne being a TERF,
2243840	2245860	is mostly terrible for trans people,
2245860	2248080	but maybe the silver lining
2248080	2250440	is that the most famous novelist in the world
2250440	2253000	having a public transphobic breakdown
2253000	2255420	is providing a wealth of insight
2255420	2258000	about the interior world of a transphobe.
2258000	2260220	In Turf Wars, Joanne claims her interest
2260220	2264060	in the trans issue is intensely personal,
2264060	2266020	and she has two reasons why it's personal.
2266020	2269520	The first is she thinks that if she had been a child today,
2269520	2271080	she would have been transed.
2271080	2272400	Someone would have transed her.
2272400	2273680	You know, people are being transed
2273680	2275240	to left and right these days.
2275240	2277160	It's a reasonable thing to be concerned about.
2277160	2279100	Trans people, we're always on the lookout
2279100	2281120	for the next person we can trans.
2281120	2283880	So all we want to do is trans people.
2283880	2288040	I transed four people this morning before I ate breakfast.
2288040	2289940	She thinks that she would have been recruited
2289940	2292920	by the transsexual empire and forced to take hormones
2292920	2295400	by the dark cabal of endocrinologists.
2295400	2297060	And in support of this speculation,
2297060	2299300	Joanne rehashes a bunch of transphobic tropes
2299300	2301160	about social contagion and to quote,
2301160	2302800	4,400% increase in goblins.
2302800	2303660	4,400% increase in goblins.
2303660	2306220	Girls being referred for transitioning treatment.
2306220	2308100	And that sounds pretty alarming, right?
2308100	2309880	4,400%.
2309880	2312540	But you have to keep in mind that 10 years ago,
2312540	2316500	only 32 assigned female patients under 18 were referred.
2316500	2320240	And by last year, that number was 1,740,
2320240	2322620	with the biggest increase happening five years ago.
2322620	2325300	You know, the transgender tipping point year.
2325300	2326760	So that is a big increase,
2326760	2329100	but it corresponds to the biggest ever increase
2329100	2330460	in trans visibility.
2330460	2332060	So it does make sense.
2332060	2333460	And there's 11 million children,
2333460	2334900	in the UK.
2334900	2339900	So let's say 5.5 million girls and 1,740 is 0.03% of that.
2343080	2345560	And considering that around 1% of adults
2345560	2347060	are some kind of transgender,
2347060	2352060	0.03% of kids is not really an alarming number to me.
2352440	2354920	If anything, you'd expect it to be higher.
2354920	2357020	But part of Joanne's problem here
2357020	2359360	is that she seems not to really understand
2359360	2361080	what being trans is.
2361080	2363300	The writings of young trans men reveal a group of trans women
2363300	2365640	in a group of notably sensitive and clever people.
2365640	2369080	The more of their accounts of gender dysphoria I've read,
2369080	2371960	with their insightful descriptions of anxiety,
2371960	2376640	dissociation, eating disorders, self-harm, and self-hatred,
2376640	2378300	the more I've wondered whether,
2378300	2380680	if I'd been born 30 years later,
2380680	2382820	I too might have tried to transition.
2382820	2386020	The allure of escaping womanhood would have been huge.
2386020	2388760	If I had found community and sympathy online
2388760	2391240	that I couldn't find in my immediate environment,
2391240	2393080	I believe I could have been persuaded
2393080	2394800	to turn myself into the son
2394800	2398020	my father had openly said he'd have preferred.
2398020	2401140	Fortunately for me, I found my own sense of otherness
2401140	2403420	and my ambivalence about being a woman
2403420	2407140	reflected in the work of female writers and musicians
2407140	2409840	who reassured me that, in spite of everything,
2409840	2413480	a sexist world tries to throw at the female-bodied.
2413480	2415980	It's fine not to feel pink, frilly,
2415980	2417840	and compliant inside your own head.
2417840	2422840	It's okay to feel confused, dark, both sexual and non-sexual.
2423080	2426380	It's okay to feel unsure of what or who you are.
2426380	2430180	Okay, so there's a lot to unpack here,
2430180	2431820	and let's start by making a list
2431820	2435380	of things being a transgender man is not.
2435380	2438400	Having anxiety, having dissociation,
2438400	2441480	having an eating disorder, doing self-harm,
2441480	2443760	doing self-hatred, a viable way
2443760	2446260	to make your sexist father proud,
2446260	2449300	not feeling pink, not feeling frilly,
2449300	2453040	not being compliant, feeling confused,
2453080	2458080	feeling dark, feeling sexual, feeling non-sexual,
2458900	2461620	feeling unsure of who you are.
2461620	2465480	Okay, so you can be a trans man and experience some
2465480	2467220	or even all of these things,
2467220	2471420	but none of these things are what being a trans man is.
2471420	2474880	Wanting to take testosterone to masculinize your body
2474880	2477500	and literally live your life as a man
2477500	2479800	is not the same as the typical struggles
2479800	2481040	other girls go through.
2481040	2483080	Joanne is projecting her own memories
2483080	2485540	of troubled adolescence onto trans men,
2485540	2487920	and then saying, oh, clearly they were going
2487920	2489280	through the same things I was,
2489280	2492920	just someone persuaded them to transition.
2492920	2494840	It's a limitation of human empathy
2494840	2497600	that sometimes when we're trying to understand
2497600	2499360	what someone else is feeling,
2499360	2503580	the best we can do is to project our feelings onto them.
2503580	2506140	And sometimes that's a misrepresentation.
2506140	2508680	Sometimes other people are experiencing things
2508680	2510820	that we have never experienced.
2510820	2512900	So we have to be aware of that.
2512900	2515240	We have to invent explanations
2515240	2518740	about why they're not behaving the way we think they should.
2518740	2521600	Someone is persuading them to transition.
2521600	2524500	But this fear mongering about kids being persuaded
2524500	2527560	to transition is just not how things work.
2527560	2529220	From the way transphobes talk about it,
2529220	2531360	you'd think whenever a little girl on the playground
2531360	2532720	picks up a toy truck,
2532720	2536220	an endocrinologist pops out from behind a tree and says,
2536220	2538620	we've got a nonconformist on our hands, Johnson.
2538620	2540580	Stand by, I'm gonna trans him.
2541560	2542640	But this is the narrative
2542900	2544280	transphobes are pushing,
2544280	2547260	in particular about young transmasculine people.
2547260	2550300	Last year, a transphobic screed of a book came out
2550300	2552660	that is essentially to transmasculine people
2552660	2555400	what the transsexual empire was to trans women.
2555400	2558000	It's called Irreversible Damage,
2558000	2561820	The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters.
2561820	2564620	Chapter one, the contagion.
2564620	2565520	Jesus.
2565520	2568060	Laying it on a little thick, don't you think, Abigail?
2568060	2570680	The argument is that female to male transgenderism
2570680	2572900	is an infectious social disease.
2572900	2575160	Which is literally the argument Hitler made
2575160	2578460	about homosexuality, but okay, great.
2578460	2581640	I think a major problem with media coverage of trans issues
2581640	2583560	is that not enough attention is paid
2583560	2586240	to transphobia against trans men.
2586240	2588260	Like after the J.K. Rowling story broke,
2588260	2590160	Daniel Radcliffe came out and said,
2590160	2592080	transgender women are women.
2592080	2593580	And that's very nice of him,
2593580	2597120	but a huge section of Joanne's essay is about trans men.
2597120	2600200	In fact, she spends more words on trans men
2600200	2601660	than on any other topic.
2601660	2602740	So I think it's worth looking in particular.
2602740	2604600	at that.
2604600	2608360	Something I've noticed is transphobia against trans men
2608360	2611460	is not the same as transphobia against trans women.
2611460	2612780	There's a lot of similarities,
2612780	2615160	but they're really two different prejudices.
2615160	2617600	And they come from different psychological places.
2617600	2619820	In the same way that lesbophobia is different
2619820	2621740	from homophobia against gay men.
2621740	2624420	For trans women, I would say the distinctive experience
2624420	2627840	of transphobia is being simultaneously treated
2627840	2631020	as a pornographic female fetish object
2631020	2632120	and
2632120	2634060	as a dangerous male predator.
2634060	2635520	The ultimate sex demon,
2635520	2638320	this kind of incubus succubus who will
2638320	2640720	ravish your wife and trap your husband.
2640720	2642980	Your polygamous commune will be devastated.
2642980	2646400	Whereas I feel like trans masculine people are less vilified,
2646400	2648940	but so infantilized.
2648940	2651520	I guess transphobes view trans men as women,
2651520	2654840	so a lot of misogynistic tropes still apply.
2654840	2657040	So much for transitioning to escape sexism.
2657040	2661500	The story is often that these vulnerable, confused girls
2661500	2663480	can't possibly decide for themselves
2663480	2665180	what to do with their own bodies,
2665180	2667580	so the courts must intervene to take control.
2667580	2669960	Which is exactly what just happened in the UK,
2669960	2672100	where trans youth under 16 will now need
2672100	2674020	not only the approval of a doctor,
2674020	2675680	but will need to seek a court order
2675680	2677480	in order to get puberty blockers.
2677480	2679260	And the justification given for this
2679260	2682600	mirrored exactly Joanne's concerns
2682600	2685760	about fragile, vulnerable teenage girls
2685760	2688240	being unable to make informed decisions.
2688240	2689940	In her essay, Joanne says,
2689940	2693220	I happen to know a self-described transsexual woman
2693220	2695920	who's older than I am and wonderful.
2695920	2698400	Although she's open about her past as a gay man,
2698400	2700260	I've always found it hard to think of her
2700260	2701960	as anything other than a woman.
2701960	2704420	Being older, though, she went through a long
2704420	2707120	and rigorous process of evaluation,
2707120	2709980	psychotherapy, and staged transformation.
2709980	2712140	The current explosion of trans activism
2712140	2716160	is urging a removal of almost all the robust systems
2716160	2718720	through which candidates for sex reassignment
2718720	2719920	were once required to pass.
2719940	2721600	So that's what she wants.
2721600	2725360	She wants robust systems of medical gatekeeping,
2725360	2727740	which is the same thing Janice Raymond wants,
2727740	2730320	just Joanne's more polite about it.
2730320	2731420	I want to make a drink.
2735700	2737660	Sometimes people ask me if I used to be a bartender.
2737660	2739320	No, just drank a lot.
2739320	2741300	Ugh, we're revealing leg again.
2741300	2742160	The scandal.
2742160	2745900	Putting a wet, white chiffon thing over it
2745900	2748420	is that much more chaste.
2748420	2749220	Well, I'm an extremely chaste woman.
2749220	2752800	I try to honor God with my body.
2752800	2754780	That's why I got a sex change.
2754780	2757680	I'm honoring God with my sex change.
2757680	2758880	I'm not drunk enough for this.
2758880	2761920	So I also want to point out that cis men and cis women
2761920	2764600	are often transphobic for different reasons.
2764600	2767540	A lot of cis men are transphobic against trans women
2767540	2771120	because the thought that a man can become a woman
2771120	2773800	threatens the certainty of their own manhood.
2773800	2775720	It's similar to the reason a lot of straight men
2775720	2776900	are homophobic.
2776900	2778980	They feel their own masculinity is threatened,
2778980	2781500	and of course, a lot of straight men
2781500	2782940	are attracted to trans women,
2782940	2785260	and they feel that that attraction threatens
2785260	2787420	their identity as straight men.
2787420	2790320	Back in my comphet days when I dated men,
2790320	2792680	for a couple straight guys I hooked up with,
2792680	2796060	going down on me was like crossing the fucking Rubicon.
2796060	2797460	This is it, Mr. Frodo.
2797460	2798960	If I take one more step,
2798960	2801720	I'll be the farthest from heterosexual I've ever been.
2801720	2804780	Okay, Samwise, whatever you need to tell yourself.
2804780	2807700	And afterwards, they go into this whole Cartesian spiral.
2807700	2808620	What have I done?
2808980	2810400	What does this mean?
2810400	2811300	Who am I?
2811300	2813220	I think for a lot of cis women,
2813220	2815840	the very existence of trans men
2815840	2818440	sends them into a similar identity crisis.
2818440	2820860	I think a lot of women have had to fight
2820860	2823000	a really difficult internal battle
2823000	2824980	to make peace with their own womanhood.
2824980	2826300	And for some women,
2826300	2830100	confronting the existence of transgender people
2830100	2832480	seems to open some old wounds.
2832480	2834020	Like I've noticed in particular
2834020	2837160	that some of the most virulent and obsessive TERFs
2837160	2838540	are older lesbian women,
2838540	2841480	on the more butch side of things.
2841480	2843880	And these women see hyper-feminine trans women
2843880	2845300	in makeup and dresses,
2845300	2846140	and they say,
2846140	2848900	that is not what being a woman is.
2848900	2851660	I've had to fight for my own identity
2851660	2855040	against the idea that that's what being a woman is.
2855040	2857300	These are just misogynistic stereotypes.
2857300	2859560	You are a parody of womanhood.
2859560	2860780	You're a fetishist.
2860780	2862480	And when they see trans men,
2862480	2864320	they say, you're a traitor.
2864320	2865740	You're a self-loather.
2865740	2868220	Why can't you learn to accept yourself as a woman,
2868220	2869800	the way I've had to?
2869800	2872160	But this is all projection and misunderstanding.
2872160	2873800	Trans women do not think
2873800	2876580	that wearing dresses is what makes us women.
2876580	2878380	And trans men do not think
2878380	2881440	that not feeling pink, frilly, and compliant
2881440	2882800	is what makes them men.
2882800	2885500	These are meanings that JK Rowling is assigning
2885500	2888180	to trans people's actions in her own brain,
2888180	2889960	because she perceives our lives
2889960	2892460	as some kind of commentary on gender,
2892460	2894580	with an implied ideology
2894580	2896960	about what it means to be a man or a woman.
2896960	2898200	But that's your interpretation,
2898200	2899220	Joanne.
2899220	2902200	That's a meaning that you are imposing on us,
2902200	2905700	because it seems you have a lot of traumatic gender baggage
2905700	2906540	of your own,
2906540	2908760	and it's interfering with your ability
2908760	2911380	to genuinely empathize with trans people.
2911380	2912760	You know, at the end of your essay,
2912760	2915860	you say that you never forget the inner complexity
2915860	2917480	when it comes to trans people.
2917480	2918840	And that's a nice thought,
2918840	2922560	but until you're actually able to stop seeing trans people
2922560	2926160	as some kind of like abstract theory of gender,
2926160	2928080	or as a projection of your own
2928080	2929160	adolescence,
2929160	2931400	then you're not really seeing us
2931400	2935320	as distinct individuals with our own experiences and stories.
2935320	2938700	And since you're a self-appointed spokesperson
2938700	2939760	on trans people,
2939760	2941540	sorry, gender issues,
2941540	2943080	I think it would be good if you listened
2943080	2946880	to the experiences of trans men without, for instance,
2946880	2951180	superimposing your own troubled relationship with your father.
2951180	2954080	I should probably talk about the book,
2954080	2957240	since I did go to the trouble to read all 900 pages,
2957240	2960300	because unlike certain other YouTubers,
2960300	2962320	I do in fact know how to read.
2962320	2965240	Troubled Blood was published in September 2020
2965240	2968560	by Joanne Rowling under her pen name, Robert Galbraith.
2968560	2970480	You know, for someone apparently so concerned
2970480	2973940	about her womanhood being erased by the transsexuals,
2973940	2977600	the fact that she publishes under a male pen name is,
2977600	2978760	it's interesting.
2978760	2980360	It's a choice.
2980360	2981620	God, this thing is huge.
2981620	2983700	It's like the infinite jest of terfury.
2983700	2986320	So Troubled Blood is a detective novel about,
2986320	2989320	about the simmering heterosexual tension
2989320	2991120	between two investigators.
2991120	2993400	And that's really what Rowling does best, isn't it?
2993400	2994560	Simmering.
2994560	2997100	There's a lot of simmering in the Harry Potter universe,
2997100	3000700	and a lot of fans who'd like to raise that simmer to a boil.
3005960	3007680	Hello, Daniel.
3007680	3009560	I love you, grown-up Harry Potter.
3009560	3012480	Let me show you my love the only way I know how.
3016320	3021480	Oh, baby.
3023560	3032320	Is there going to be discourse about this?
3032320	3039020	Look, if it's wrong to have compact feelings about Daniel Radcliffe,
3039020	3040020	I don't want to be right.
3040020	3043040	I will not be shamed for my shameful fantasies.
3043040	3044040	Get out of here, Daniel.
3044040	3045040	This is the final farewell moment.
3045040	3045960	I love you.
3045960	3047660	farewell to my heterosexuality.
3047660	3048820	Goodbye, Daniel!
3050360	3051820	And your little arm, too.
3053360	3054740	You stay out of this, Linda.
3054740	3058160	Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow, meow.
3058160	3061920	So the prime suspect in Troubled Blood is Dennis Creed,
3061920	3065140	a cross-dressing serial killer who dresses as a woman
3065140	3069040	to lull his victims, whom he abducts, tortures,
3069040	3070980	rapes, and murders.
3070980	3071980	Interesting.
3071980	3075780	Now, I enjoyed this book because, like most women,
3075780	3078320	I enjoy books about dangerous perverts.
3078320	3081060	But a lot of trans people, literate trans people,
3081060	3083260	have called this book transphobic.
3083260	3084440	And you might think that's unfair,
3084440	3089120	since the character Dennis Creed, this serial killer,
3089120	3092020	is a, he's not a trans, he's a cross-dresser.
3092020	3094080	This has nothing to do with trans people.
3094080	3096300	Why so triggered, snowflake?
3096300	3098820	Well, Precious, there's a couple things I think
3098820	3100940	are worth taking into consideration here.
3100940	3104900	One is that the transvestite, or transsexual serial killer,
3104900	3106660	is an old transphobic trope.
3106660	3109180	It's a cliche that goes back decades.
3109180	3111780	And I take great offense to the suggestion
3111780	3113900	that trans women are serial killers,
3113900	3117780	because I, for one, haven't been caught yet.
3117780	3120300	The trope seems to originate in 1960
3120300	3122280	with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.
3122280	3123240	That's just my guess, though.
3123240	3124460	I haven't researched this.
3124460	3126140	Who do you think I am, Lindsay Ellis?
3126140	3128160	So I don't think Psycho is transphobic.
3128160	3130700	The movie ends with a psychoanalytic summing up,
3130700	3134260	where the psychiatrist offers this pseudo-Freudian explanation
3134260	3135740	that Norman cross-dresses
3135740	3138700	because the personality of his dead mother takes over
3138700	3140960	and, out of jealousy, kills the women
3140960	3142520	Norman is attracted to.
3142520	3145140	Therefore, the psychiatrist explains,
3145140	3148140	Norman is not a real transvestite.
3148140	3150340	You're a fake transvestite, Norman.
3150340	3151620	Trender alert.
3151620	3152460	But I do think that,
3152460	3154660	even if Psycho isn't explicitly transphobic,
3154660	3157380	movies can subconsciously implant ideas
3157380	3159960	and feelings into our brains.
3159960	3161740	And I do think it's worth noting
3161740	3164060	that the most famous and most terrifying
3164260	3166020	scene in cinema history
3166020	3171020	is of a man in a dress attacking a woman in a bathroom.
3171200	3173060	To quote a popular film critic,
3173060	3176320	you might not have noticed it, but your brain did.
3176320	3177980	The cross-dressing Psycho trope
3177980	3179820	became explicitly transphobic
3179820	3183540	in the campy 1980s Psycho ripoff, Dressed to Kill,
3183540	3186660	in which Michael Caine plays a transsexual psychiatrist
3186660	3191660	who, yes, dresses as a woman to kill women he's attracted to.
3191660	3193440	He was a transsexual.
3193440	3194260	What?
3194260	3195260	I'm a transsexual.
3195260	3196940	You see, there's some men and women, too,
3196940	3198420	think they're born in the wrong body.
3198420	3200060	They're called transsexuals,
3200060	3202680	and all they wanna do is have their sex changed.
3202680	3204980	It's all they wanna do, the transsexuals.
3204980	3208380	Dressed to Kill also ends with a psychiatric summing up,
3208380	3210500	where the doctor explains that Michael Caine
3210500	3214180	is a case of opposite sexes inhabiting the same body.
3214180	3216980	But it's the female Michael Caine who kills,
3216980	3218640	because, and I quote,
3218640	3220460	Elliot's penis became erect,
3220460	3221820	and Bobby took control,
3221820	3224260	trying to kill anyone that made Elliot masculinely,
3224260	3225100	sexual.
3225100	3226600	There's often a misogynistic trope
3226600	3228480	hiding behind the transphobic one.
3228480	3231760	It's the woman in the man who does the murders.
3231760	3233180	It's the mother's fault.
3233180	3237280	His mother was a clinging, demanding woman.
3237280	3239560	The most mature iteration of this trope,
3239560	3241720	the crown jewel of transphobic movies,
3241720	3244260	is, of course, the Silence of the Lambs,
3244260	3246060	which is honestly one of my favorite movies,
3246060	3248180	because Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins
3248180	3250200	are just radiant in it,
3250200	3252260	and also, I hate myself.
3252260	3253260	Silence of the Lambs is a story that's a little bit more,
3253260	3254100	I don't know.
3254100	3255760	It's a story of Buffalo Bill,
3255760	3259000	an animal lover and innovative seamstress.
3259000	3261220	Buffalo Bill is a trans-trender.
3261220	3262480	A trans-trender!
3262480	3264920	Who kills women to make a suit out of their skin,
3264920	3268480	because his application for sex reassignment was rejected,
3268480	3271400	because, according to Hannibal Lecter,
3271400	3273920	Billy is not a real transsexual.
3273920	3276960	Hannibal Lecter is a true scum.
3276960	3279040	There's so much gatekeeping of trans people,
3279040	3280940	I just want to use this opportunity
3280940	3283940	to reassure my trans audience that, even if you've only seen
3283940	3287180	one or two people, you're valid.
3287180	3289760	I entertained myself.
3289760	3292320	That's how I continue to struggle onwards.
3292320	3295240	Billy hates his own identity, you see,
3295240	3297620	and he thinks that makes him a transsexual,
3297620	3301840	but his pathology is a thousand times more savage
3301840	3303180	and more terrifying.
3303180	3307060	More savage and terrifying than being a transsexual?
3307060	3308620	Is that even possible?
3308620	3310340	Okay, it's definitely getting brighter in here,
3310340	3312440	because the sun is rising.
3312440	3313060	Silence of the Lambs differs, but it's not the only one.
3313060	3313720	Silence of the Lambs differs, but it's not the only one.
3313720	3316660	It differs from it's male-gazy predecessors
3316660	3320020	in that it kind of feels like a radical feminist movie.
3320020	3323180	Clarice is a perfect blend of strength and vulnerability,
3323180	3325700	and every man in this movie is a pig,
3325700	3327120	except maybe Hannibal Lecter,
3327120	3329380	the only one who actually respects Clarice,
3329380	3330580	the only real gentleman,
3330580	3332920	with his Goldberg variations and his sketches
3332920	3333740	of the Duomo.
3333740	3335120	Chilton's a pig,
3335120	3337080	the entomologist is a swine,
3337080	3338880	even Crawford's kind of a pig.
3338880	3340220	The Pigs are Pigs,
3340220	3341640	Migs is Pigs,
3341640	3342840	and Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.
3342840	3343340	And Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.
3343340	3343680	And Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.
3343680	3343700	And Buffalo Bill is the ultimate pig.
3343700	3344700	The ultimate pig.
3344700	3345700	Die Uberschwein.
3345700	3346700	It's in the original Sherman.
3346700	3348700	The fuck am I talking about?
3348700	3349700	What?
3349700	3355480	And he's obsessed with death's head moths, this demonization of the most self-congratulatory
3355480	3357480	metaphor for gender transformation.
3357480	3361380	I can't believe I finally emerged as a beautiful butterfly.
3361380	3362380	Show don't tell, Lily.
3362380	3365620	Oh my god, I can't wait till trans people have so many rights that it's okay to make
3365620	3366620	fun of us.
3366620	3367680	There's a lot to work with.
3367680	3369720	So Silence of the Lambs is a good movie.
3369720	3374320	I'm not saying it's inherently wrong to make a movie or write a book about a transgender
3374320	3377960	serial killer, but there is an issue of representation.
3377960	3382760	You know, for decades there was close to zero good representation of trans people in movies
3382760	3388480	or TV, but a whole host of cross-dressing serial killers, and that has an effect on
3388480	3389480	the way people think.
3389480	3394360	When it comes time to debate bathroom bills, and people are subconsciously remembering
3394360	3398480	psycho, that has serious consequences for trans people.
3398480	3399480	It's getting so bright in here.
3399480	3401520	The sun has, like, the sun has risen.
3401520	3407880	And it's also not psychologically good for us to grow up only seeing monstrous caricatures
3407880	3409340	of ourselves in media.
3409340	3414400	Like even as late as my early 20s, I didn't know any trans people, but I'd seen these
3414400	3416100	transgender horror movies.
3416100	3421400	I think the most positive approximation of representation I knew about was, like, Frankenfurter
3421400	3422400	and Divine.
3422400	3428080	And both of them are also psychotic murderers, just, you know, in a fun way.
3428080	3429080	Should've just gotten her those chocolates.
3429080	3430460	Or those cha-cha heels.
3430460	3436260	So I knew back then I was some kind of a trans, but I guess I felt that it was basically the
3436260	3438920	moral equivalent of being a serial killer.
3438920	3441680	Not something you tell other people about, that's for sure.
3441680	3443460	And things have changed in the last 10 years.
3443460	3446900	I mean, it's a different world for trans people than it was.
3446900	3451120	There's trans people now who are 10 years younger than me who don't even hate themselves.
3451120	3452120	Can't relate.
3452120	3456120	So this takes us back to 2020 and troubled blood.
3456120	3457120	Joanne has written a book about a serial killer who is a serial killer.
3457120	3458120	And she's a serial killer.
3458120	3461900	A serial killer who dresses as a woman to kill women.
3461900	3462900	Groundbreaking.
3462900	3468160	Now this is such a cliche that you'd kind of expect a seasoned writer like J.K. Rowling
3468160	3470020	to subvert it somehow.
3470020	3471020	Give us a remix.
3471020	3472460	Turn it on its head.
3472460	3475160	Humanize the monster in an unexpected way.
3475160	3477660	You know, give her a little Half-Blood Prince moment.
3477660	3479740	Or at least do something new with it.
3479740	3481080	But she really doesn't.
3481080	3483440	It's just Buffalo Bill all over again.
3483440	3485360	I guess I should read you some passages.
3485360	3486360	I'm reading it on my phone.
3486360	3487500	I'm not bringing the book out and...
3487500	3489760	Pretending to read on the book.
3489760	3493880	You can see from my little bookmarks that I read the physical book.
3493880	3494880	Yes, I'm a YouTuber.
3494880	3495880	And yes, I read a book.
3495880	3496880	So here's the psychiatrist.
3496880	3497880	There's always a psychiatrist, isn't there?
3497880	3498880	Here's the psychiatrist's diagnosis of Dennis Creed.
3498880	3499880	He's a classic sociopath, you see.
3499880	3500880	A pure example of the type.
3500880	3501880	He scores very highly on the dark triad.
3501880	3502880	Narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy.
3502880	3503880	Devious, sadistic, unrepentant, and extremely egotistical.
3503880	3504880	He's a man of his word.
3504880	3505880	He's a man of his word.
3505880	3506880	He's a man of his word.
3506880	3507880	He's a man of his word.
3507880	3508880	He's a man of his word.
3508880	3509880	He's a man of his word.
3509880	3510880	He's a man of his word.
3510880	3520940	You see, he's what we in the medical profession call the baddie.
3520940	3527080	Clint Curtis says, quote, it excited me to watch a woman who didn't know ones was being
3527080	3528080	observed.
3528080	3529080	I'd do it to my sisters.
3529080	3530560	But I'd creep up to lit windows as well.
3530560	3535640	If I got lucky, I'd see women or girls undressing, adjusting themselves, or even a glimpse of
3535640	3536640	nudity.
3536640	3540400	I was aroused not only by the obviously sensual aspects, but by the sense of power.
3540400	3540520	In the book, I opening my eyes to my what I like to consider as true innocence.
3540520	3540600	So I'm opening my eyes.
3540600	3540640	So I'm opening my eyes.
3540640	3540720	So I'm opening my eyes.
3540720	3540820	getting older, wobbly, apparent To sleep down,".
3540820	3540840	And without having b slash boops, depression, maybe the late mid days.
3540840	3540880	Maybe in bed, just it gets annoying.
3540880	3545520	I stole something of their essence from them, taking that which they had thought private and
3545520	3550340	hidden. He soon progressed to stealing women's underwear from neighbors' washing lines and even
3550340	3557600	from his grandmother, Ina. These he enjoyed wearing in secret and masturbating in. Remember when she
3557600	3563260	wrote books about wizard school? Ho ho, dear readers. So Dennis Creed is characterized as a
3563260	3569440	narcissistic male fetishist who preys on women. And like, okay, there really are men who fetishize
3569440	3574880	women's clothes, for example. I mean, Freud talked about this, right? Partialism, where sexuality
3574880	3583360	focuses on a body part or an article of clothing. And Freud theorized that fetishes emerge from the
3583360	3590840	unconscious trauma that occurs when men discover that women don't have a penis.
3593460	3599040	Boy, have I got news for Dr. Freud. But considering that Joanne has been doing a lot of gender
3599040	3599420	critical research, she's been doing a lot of research on the fact that women don't have a penis.
3599420	3606560	Reading over the past few years, it's kind of hard for me to ignore that narcissistic male
3606560	3613000	fetishist who preys on women is exactly the way a lot of TERFs characterize trans women. Remember,
3613480	3621060	the whole gender critical feminists with concerns about trans youth routine is obfuscation. These
3621060	3627660	people are bigots. And it's a pretty common canard among TERFs that trans women are hypersexual
3627660	3629400	and hyperaggressive.
3629420	3636400	Right? These inherently pornographic sex demons. But can't we just have a reasonable debate about
3636400	3643800	this? Are trans women sex demons? Why, yes. Yes, we are. The bigots are simply correct.
3643800	3650080	We're sex demons. You can't even talk to these people. Like, how do you engage with this level
3650080	3654880	of vilification? I used to take the bait and argue that, no, actually, I'm not a sex demon.
3655600	3659160	Unless you want me to be. But it's counterproductive to make that argument.
3659420	3665360	Why? Because my not-involved-in-human-trafficking t-shirt has people asking a lot of questions
3665360	3670480	already answered by my shirt. So I have a hard time believing that the character Dennis Creed
3670480	3676340	has nothing to do with Joanne's beliefs about trans people. And I also want to note that
3676340	3682180	Dennis' cross-dressing is described not just as part of the sexual satisfaction he gains from
3682180	3688100	invading women's privacy and invading women's bodies, but also as a deliberate strategy of
3688100	3688700	deception.
3689420	3693940	This says, on page 854, so you know I actually read this fucking shit.
3694080	3700160	In a wig, bit of lipstick. They think you're harmless. Odd. Maybe queer. You're the nice man
3700160	3700760	who's safe.
3701020	3702600	And earlier he's described as
3702600	3708180	Dennis Creed had been a meticulous planner, a genius of misdirection in his neat little white
3708180	3714020	van. Dressed in the pink coat he had stolen from Vi Cooper and sometimes wearing a wig that,
3714020	3718940	from a distance to a drunk victim, gave his hazy form a feminine appearance,
3719420	3720800	so that it would be an expression that made him look like a man.
3720800	3723920	But his head was long enough for his large hands to close over a gasping mouth.
3723920	3729720	So this character, sprung from Joanne's imagination, cross-dresses as a way to disarm his victims.
3729720	3736300	They mistake him for a woman. Or as, you know. And that causes them to lower their guard.
3736300	3741620	And this reminds me of one of Maya Forstadter's allegedly transphobic tweets.
3741620	3745340	Pronouns are a hypno. Important article by Hairy Leg Tarpy.
3745340	3747940	A.K.A. Wolfamort.
3747940	3748120	She who must not be a woman. But who is. She who must not be a man. She who must not be a woman.
3748120	3748320	I am the woman. I am the woman. I am the woman. I am the woman.
3748320	3748400	I am the woman. I am the woman. I am the woman. I am the woman.
3748400	3750040	She who must not be named.
3750380	3751740	Followed by J.K. Rowling.
3752020	3752900	Because of course.
3753140	3754480	Pronouns are Rohypnol.
3754600	3755740	Rohypnol is Roofies.
3755900	3758520	And there's a picture of a pill with she on it.
3758840	3760480	Pronouns are like Rohypnol.
3760700	3761820	They dull your defenses.
3762160	3763740	They change your inhibitions.
3763980	3764640	They're meant to.
3764880	3769860	You've had a lifetime's experience learning to be alert to him and to relax to her.
3770020	3770800	For good reason.
3771020	3773620	These instinctive responses keep you safe.
3773740	3775420	It's not even a conscious thing.
3775420	3777860	It's like the hairs standing on end.
3777860	3782420	Your subconscious brain is helping you not get eaten by the saber-toothed tiger that
3782420	3783880	your eyes haven't noticed yet.
3784160	3785180	I want to be alert.
3785380	3786780	I want others to be alert.
3787020	3791740	I want people to see the real picture and I want those instinctive reactions that we
3791740	3797340	feel when something is wrong to be unblunted, undulled by this cheap but effective psychological
3797340	3797860	trick.
3798120	3799880	I feel like I owe this to myself.
3800080	3802580	And I absolutely owe it to other women.
3802840	3805560	And more than anything, I owe this to girls.
3805560	3807820	I don't want to play even the tiniest.
3808020	3812620	I don't want to play even the tiniest part in grooming them to disregard their natural
3812620	3813620	protective instincts.
3813620	3815620	Those instincts are there for a reason.
3815620	3816620	To keep them safe.
3816620	3820620	They need those instincts intact and sharp.
3820620	3824620	And that's why I won't use preferred pronouns.
3824620	3828620	Using Rohypnol on others isn't a courtesy.
3828620	3829620	Okay.
3829620	3834860	So, these are the thoughts of someone who's been hurt.
3834860	3835860	Speaking of which.
3835860	3836860	Let's return now.
3836860	3842620	The reason that JK Rowling feels her interest in trans people is intensely personal.
3867860	3868860	I was born this way.
3868860	3869860	Born as a fucking idiot.
3869860	3870860	I made a gin martini because I'm 200 years old.
3870860	3871860	It's kind of an Agatha drink.
3871860	3872860	Well, I'm a 200 year old witch.
3872860	3873860	That's the plot.
3873860	3874860	Pay attention.
3874860	3875860	It makes sense.
3875860	3876860	Also, a martini.
3876860	3877860	What is a martini?
3877860	3878860	It's an excuse to drink a glass of gin.
3878860	3879860	I should probably, um, probably eat an olive.
3879860	3880860	Or this is going to go straight to my fucking, my brain.
3880860	3881860	Okay, we have to be serious now.
3881860	3882860	In Turf Wars, Joanne writes,
3882860	3883860	I've been in the public eye for a long time.
3883860	3884860	I've been in the public eye for a long time.
3884860	3885860	I've been in the public eye for a long time.
3885860	3886860	I've been in the public eye for a long time.
3886860	3887860	I've been in the public eye for a long time.
3896860	3900300	I've been in the public eye now for over 20 years, and I have never talked publicly
3900300	3903500	about being a domestic abuse and sexual assault survivor.
3903500	3907780	On Saturday morning, I read that the Scottish government is proceeding with its controversial
3907780	3913360	gender recognition plans, which will, in effect, mean that all a man needs to do to become
3913360	3915600	a woman is to say he's one.
3915600	3921660	To use a very contemporary word, I was triggered, ground down by the relentless attacks from
3921660	3924080	trans activists on social media.
3924080	3926820	I spent much of Saturday in a very dark place.
3926820	3932100	Inside my head as memories of a serious sexual assault I suffered in my twenties recurred
3932100	3933100	on a loop.
3933100	3936920	I couldn't shut out those memories, and I was finding it hard to contain my anger and
3936920	3941480	disappointment about the way I believe my government is playing fast and loose with
3941480	3943940	women's and girls' safety.
3943940	3951040	Okay, so for Joanne, her traumatic experience being attacked by a man is psychologically
3951040	3956320	related to her concerns about the legal recognition of trans people.
3956320	3960300	And about trans people saying nasty things about her on Twitter.
3960300	3965840	She feels intensely about this issue, because the discourse around it literally triggers
3965840	3966840	her PTSD.
3966840	3968420	In her own words,
3968420	3973220	The scars left by violence and sexual assault don't disappear, no matter how loved you are
3973220	3975640	and no matter how much money you've made.
3975640	3980500	My perennial jumpiness is a family joke, and even I know it's funny, but I pray my daughters
3980500	3985600	never have the same reasons I do for hating sudden loud noises or finding people behind me when I'm in trouble.
3986320	3994380	A common symptom of trauma is hypervigilance, a constant alertness to danger.
3994380	4000440	This is described in a very wise book called Conflict Is Not Abuse by Sarah Shulman.
4000440	4005380	The traumatized person's sense of their ability to protect themselves has been damaged
4005380	4006560	or destroyed.
4006560	4012180	They feel endangered even if there is no actual danger in the present, because in the past
4012180	4016300	they have experienced profoundly invasive cruelty and they know it is possible.
4016320	4022320	I want to respect that having a trauma trigger response is a real experience of suffering
4022320	4028560	that is not the victim's fault, even in cases where that response is irrational or politically
4028560	4029560	incorrect.
4029560	4036100	For example, if you got mugged by a black teenager, I wouldn't judge you if you felt
4036100	4039560	a little jumpy around black teenagers for a while.
4039560	4045140	However, if that jumpiness motivates you to become a campaigner for more militant policing
4045140	4046320	of black neighborhoods,
4046320	4052600	then you are participating in anti-black racism, and that I will criticize, regardless of
4052600	4053600	your trauma.
4053600	4058420	I hope it goes without saying that trans people gaining easier access to legal recognition
4058420	4065280	in Scotland in 2020 is completely unrelated to Joanne Rowling being assaulted by a cis
4065280	4068060	man in the 1990s.
4068060	4069480	This is a non sequitur.
4069480	4074660	So it's a little odd to me that, while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize that her
4074660	4075720	hypervigilance is the result of a trauma trigger response, it's also a little odd to me that,
4075720	4076220	while Joanne is self-aware enough to recognize that her hypervigilance is the result of a
4076220	4077680	trauma trigger response, it's also a little odd to me that,
4077680	4082160	and she's self-aware enough to realize that her hypervigilance is often irrational to
4082160	4085020	the point where she herself finds humor in it,
4085020	4091960	she's somehow not self-aware enough to realize that her fears about trans people are an irrational
4091960	4095080	manifestation of that hypervigilance.
4095080	4099720	And again, it's not that I'm unsympathetic to her trauma, and I would be nothing but
4099720	4104620	sympathetic if her feelings about this amounted to simply being triggered by, for example,
4104620	4105540	perceiving
4105540	4111140	male in the women's bathroom. Which is something most trans women are sensitive to. Like I've spoken
4111140	4116100	to trans women who are worried they don't pass or who know they don't pass and who do everything
4116100	4121220	they can to avoid using a public bathroom because they don't want to make cis women uncomfortable.
4121220	4126740	So these trans women go through life every day compromising their own comfort and safety
4126740	4133700	to protect cis women's feelings of comfort and safety. But Joanne's transphobia has so outgrown
4133700	4140740	the scope of an automatic trigger response, it's become a fixation for years. To the point where
4140740	4146660	she's written a 900 page novel about a serial killer who cross-dresses to trick women into
4146660	4153540	being less vigilant. And now the primary political cause she's decided to use her superstardom to
4153540	4160500	champion is opposition to trans liberation. And past trauma is just not an excuse for that.
4160500	4163380	Like if you're against gay marriage because you were
4163380	4163620	traumatized by a trans woman, you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized by a trans woman.
4163620	4163680	Like if you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized by a trans woman, you're against
4163680	4164160	gay marriage because you were traumatized by a trans woman, you're against gay marriage because you were traumatized
4164160	4169840	as a child when your father left your mother for a man, you're still a homophobe, right? You're not
4169840	4175280	less of a bigot because your bigotry has a tragic backstory. In fact, bigotry often has a tragic
4175280	4181200	backstory. Bigotry involves feelings of being threatened or attacked, so it's often rooted in
4181200	4187120	trauma. After the collective trauma of 9-11, Americans felt threatened not just by Al-Qaeda
4187120	4193600	but by the entire religion of Islam. And this was used and is still being used to justify wars, to
4193600	4200720	discrimination, travel bans, hate crimes. Feelings of victimization are often used as a justification
4200720	4204320	for aggression. And when the target of that aggression is a marginalized group,
4204880	4210240	the result is bigotry. Now what TERFs say is that it's actually the trans activists
4210240	4215840	who are the real aggressors, who are the real bigots. Trans women are men, they're agents of the
4215840	4223520	patriarchy, creepy perverts demanding access to female spaces. TERF is a misogynistic slur designed to
4223520	4231200	silence women. It's biological women who are the real victims. The real victim. So often in debates
4231200	4237520	on social issues, we're faced with two opposing sides, both claiming to be the victim, and we're
4237520	4244560	often told to believe victims, believe marginalized people. Well, if only it was that easy. So often the
4244560	4251440	exact point in question is who is the victim and who's the oppressor. That book I quoted earlier,
4251440	4252800	Conflict Is Not Abuse,
4252800	4255500	describes the way the overstatement of harm
4255500	4258080	is used as a justification for cruelty
4258080	4260880	in situations ranging from romantic relationships
4260880	4262520	to international affairs.
4262520	4264860	Bullies often conceptualize themselves
4264860	4266480	as being under attack
4266480	4268780	when they are the ones originating the pain.
4268780	4270040	Throughout Joanne's essay,
4270040	4272280	she frequently represents herself
4272280	4276240	as taking a defiant, free-speechy stand against
4276240	4279500	accusations and threats from trans activists.
4279500	4281280	The trans activists who declare
4281280	4283740	that TERFs need punching and re-educating.
4283740	4287020	Huge numbers of women are justifiably terrified
4287020	4288780	by the trans activists.
4288780	4290680	And in her subsequent tweets,
4290680	4294980	she frames herself as the victim of a witch hunt.
4294980	4297140	Sometimes a T-shirt just speaks to you.
4297140	4298820	This witch doesn't burn.
4298820	4300240	This is the new Salem.
4300240	4302640	Women are being attacked online
4302640	4305240	for taking a stand against the transsexuals.
4305240	4306680	This witch doesn't burn.
4306680	4308240	Let's see what else we have for sale
4308240	4311240	at wildwomenworkshop.com.
4311280	4313260	Fuck your pronouns.
4313260	4315900	Trans men are my sisters.
4315900	4317760	Sorry about your dick, bro.
4317760	4318680	That's a good one.
4318680	4319520	I'd wear that.
4319520	4320920	Don't call me sis.
4320920	4324460	Sis is a vile slur against my tender normality.
4324460	4325620	Must be really hard for you.
4325620	4326880	Not being a .
4326880	4328380	War is peace.
4328380	4330220	Freedom is slavery.
4330220	4332320	Ignorance is strength.
4332320	4334600	Trans women are women.
4334600	4336600	Got the sense of persecution.
4336600	4338180	This is Orwell's nightmare?
4338180	4340260	This is how Nazi Germany started?
4340260	4341100	First, Hitler told us
4341100	4342320	he told the transgenders
4342320	4344700	they were super-hecking valid uwu.
4344700	4346200	Then he burned their books out.
4346200	4347040	Wait.
4347040	4348520	Oh, no.
4348520	4351300	That's actually the opposite of what happened.
4351300	4352460	Slurs.
4352460	4354280	Feminist T-shirt.
4354280	4355300	Nice trilby.
4355300	4356240	It's very dapper.
4356240	4357360	Slurs.
4357360	4358620	Man-hater.
4358620	4359600	Feminazi.
4359600	4360420	Prude.
4360420	4361260	Witch.
4361260	4362100	Bigot.
4362100	4363100	Wait, bigot?
4363100	4365240	Are we reclaiming bigot now?
4365240	4370240	Is bigot a slur used to silence the females?
4371100	4372260	Anne wrote in her essay
4372260	4374920	that she was standing up in solidarity with
4374920	4376920	women who have histories like mine
4376920	4378500	who've been slurred as bigots
4378500	4381480	for having concerns around single-sex spaces.
4381480	4383340	Slurred as bigots.
4383340	4386260	There's something so revealing about the claim
4386260	4388220	that bigot is a slur
4388220	4390400	because so much of indirect bigotry
4390400	4394420	is an attempt to reverse the roles of victim and aggressor.
4394420	4398900	Isn't calling people bigots the real bigotry?
4398900	4399740	It's good.
4399740	4400580	It's very clever.
4400580	4402640	A white racist will hardly ever use
4402640	4404540	the phrase white supremacy.
4404540	4407780	No, they say white genocide.
4407780	4409540	Always on the defensive.
4409540	4414260	And now transphobes are bemoaning lesbian extinction.
4414260	4416500	The same conservative media,
4416500	4418820	who 10 years ago were portraying lesbians
4418820	4421920	as like angry, mannish ,
4421920	4424900	have now created this mythology of lesbians
4424900	4428620	as these virginal damsels in distress
4428620	4430440	who are threatened with invasion,
4430440	4432920	and now extinction.
4432920	4436840	On one front, by the dark cabal of endocrinologists
4436840	4439580	who are somehow coercing them into becoming men.
4439580	4440800	Elliot, no.
4440800	4442260	You can't possibly be doing this
4442260	4443460	because you're 33 years old
4443460	4445260	and capable of autonomous thought.
4445260	4446760	Clearly, you are tricked
4446760	4449740	by the transgender lesbian extinction agenda.
4449740	4453540	And on the other front, by trans women who, we're told,
4453540	4455980	are slurring as bigots.
4455980	4458040	Lesbians who won't sleep with them.
4458040	4458500	Joanne claims that none of the gender-critical women,
4458500	4459600	Joanne claims that none of the gender-critical women,
4459600	4460300	Joanne claims that none of the gender-critical women,
4460300	4462660	I've talked to, hates trans people.
4462660	4463780	On the contrary,
4463780	4467020	many of them become interested in this issue in the first place
4467020	4468940	out of concern for trans youth.
4468940	4472300	And they're hugely sympathetic towards trans adults
4472300	4474380	who simply want to live their lives.
4474380	4478020	But the only gender-critical women she mentions by name
4478020	4479820	are Maya Forstadter,
4479820	4484860	who I would not describe as hugely sympathetic to trans adults,
4484860	4487220	and Magdalene Burns,
4487220	4488880	about whom Joanne says,
4488880	4490220	Magdalene was an immense,
4490220	4492460	immensely brave young feminist and lesbian.
4492460	4496460	Magdalene was a great believer in the importance of biological sex,
4496460	4499060	and didn't believe lesbians should be called bigots
4499060	4501900	for not dating trans women with penises.
4501900	4504260	Okay, so I agree,
4504260	4506620	it would be awful to call someone a bigot
4506620	4510100	just because they don't want to date a woman with a penis.
4510100	4514420	But are you sure that's why people call Magdalene Burns a bigot?
4514420	4517940	Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women
4517940	4519620	that might lead people to think she's less than a bigot?
4519620	4520220	Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than a bigot?
4520220	4522460	Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than a bigot?
4522460	4522780	Are you sure she hasn't said anything else about trans women that might lead people to think she's less than a bigot?
4522780	4526180	You are fucking blackface actors.
4526180	4527420	You aren't women.
4527420	4532140	You're men who get sexual kicks from being treated like women.
4532140	4535860	Fuck you and your dirty fucking perversions.
4535860	4538060	Our oppression isn't a fetish,
4538060	4540460	you pathetic, sick fuck.
4540460	4542260	Hugely sympathetic.
4542260	4544260	Hugely sympathetic.
4544260	4549460	Because Joanne claims that TERFs are hugely sympathetic to trans people,
4549460	4552020	and just don't want to be called bigots,
4552020	4560100	and because she constantly frames herself as the victim of terrifying trans activists who say mean things online,
4560100	4565060	I think it's fair for me to mention that this, right here,
4565060	4570460	is how I'm used to being spoken to and spoken about by TERFs.
4570460	4575100	When you're a trans woman online, TERFs pin you to the vivisection table.
4575100	4576820	They deadname and misgender you.
4576820	4578340	They mock your genitals.
4578340	4578860	They describe your gender.
4578860	4582820	They describe your surgery results as necrotic mutilated wounds.
4582820	4589180	They interpret your every feeling and experience as the manifestation of a sick, woman-hating fetish.
4589180	4591860	You know, in an unrelated video last year,
4591860	4595860	I mentioned being sexually assaulted by a man,
4595860	4599180	and I've since been told by TERFs,
4599180	4600180	essentially,
4600180	4605060	trans-identified males get sexual kicks from being treated like women.
4605060	4608460	Nathan probably enjoyed his so-called rape.
4608860	4615180	I don't even want to say that the mental,"bigmuch, huge, feels so romantic."
4615180	4622420	I hope I don't even need to say that the idea that trans women can't be raped because we'll
4622420	4627700	just enjoy it is a violently anti-feminist thought.
4627700	4636820	It's a thought that could only be believed no less by people who have spent days and weeks absorbing the dehumanizing propaganda
4636820	4638660	that TERF forums exist to promote.
4638660	4641420	who is in the room with me right now, she'd say,
4641420	4643780	I'm so sorry you've been treated that way,
4643780	4647120	but I too have been cruelly victimized online
4647120	4649000	by the trans activists.
4649000	4650080	And you know what?
4650960	4652420	I'm sure that's true.
4652420	4655560	When I listen to Joanne talk about being victimized
4655560	4659020	by trans Twitter, it's easy for me to sympathize
4659020	4661680	because trans Twitter has treated me the same way.
4661680	4665820	The vilification, the obsession, the fantasies of violence.
4665820	4667620	It's a pretty common occurrence for me
4667620	4669820	to look at my mentions and see people
4669820	4673120	with trans flag avatars posting things like.
4673120	4674920	Point of view, you are true scum
4674920	4677620	and Yoshi is gonna beat you to death with a golf club.
4677620	4679580	Hashtag yes all gamers.
4679580	4682920	Here's a thread where first they call me an anti-Semite
4682920	4684460	because three years ago I made a joke
4684460	4686140	about reptilian overlords.
4686140	4688260	And then they get mad because I said
4688260	4690300	I wanted to understand non-binary people
4690300	4692680	instead of just dogmatically believing things.
4692680	4693940	And they conclude.
4693940	4695800	So basically, fuck controversy.
4695800	4698300	For points, I want to bash her over the goddamn head
4698300	4701020	with a metal bat over and over again.
4701020	4704220	So this is the level of antipathy
4704220	4706480	that I attract from trans Twitter.
4706480	4708720	So when Joanne says she's been overwhelmed
4708720	4712280	by abusive messages, I'm inclined to believe her.
4712280	4714320	I'm sure her mentions are overwhelmed
4714320	4716980	with anime avatars saying things like.
4716980	4718660	J.K. Rowling is hypocritical trash
4718660	4721120	who literally walks millions of trans kids dead.
4721120	4723700	Harry Potter was always neoliberal garbage
4723700	4725320	and we should have seen this coming.
4725320	4727540	This dumb bitch doesn't deserve our empathy.
4727540	4730240	She deserves a backhand slap to the face.
4730240	4733020	And tweets like that are abusive.
4733020	4734360	It's not okay.
4734360	4736380	And I don't make any excuses for it.
4736380	4737940	I want to make it dark and stormy.
4737940	4739200	Sorry, I'll be right back.
4740040	4740880	Hi, I'm back.
4743240	4744080	It's good.
4744080	4746120	So I also think that there really is
4746120	4748480	an element of misogyny to them.
4748480	4749320	I had to put the drink down.
4749320	4750380	It's making me laugh.
4751500	4754840	You can't, you cannot talk about misogynistic
4754840	4757820	cyberbullying while holding a tropical drink.
4757820	4760020	It's just not possible to do with a straight face.
4760020	4763200	So I agree there really is an element of misogyny to this.
4763200	4765740	Misogyny is the most universal prejudice
4765740	4767840	and trans people are not immune.
4767840	4770820	Angry Twitter mobs are generally more vicious to women
4770820	4773320	regardless of whether their anger is justified.
4773320	4775160	There is a witch hunt impulse
4775160	4777160	that's still alive in our culture.
4777160	4780880	To be a famous woman is to constantly have every part
4780880	4784660	of your body and soul subject to endless critique.
4784840	4787460	If you're one pound overweight, they call you a fatty.
4787460	4788960	If you're one pound underweight,
4788960	4790880	they say you have an eating disorder.
4790880	4792920	And if you're exactly the right weight,
4794020	4796720	they call you a fatty with an eating disorder.
4796720	4799640	You know, it's a kind of crowdsourced abuse.
4799640	4803040	There's a reason Taylor Swift is obsessed with her haters.
4803040	4804420	When you're a famous woman,
4804420	4806500	it's hard not to be obsessed with your haters
4806500	4809720	because the haters bring the obsession to you.
4809720	4813000	But it's important to remember that haters
4813000	4814820	are not the same as bigots.
4814840	4819780	Being mean or rude or even abusive is not bigotry
4819780	4822740	unless it's tied to a history of oppression
4822740	4825660	or a backlash against a movement of equality.
4825660	4829440	So no, Mike Huckabee, homophobic is not a slur.
4829440	4830980	And no, David Silverman,
4830980	4833780	the word racist is not like the N-word.
4833780	4837220	And no, Joanne Rowling, bigot is not a slur.
4837220	4838920	Turf is not a slur.
4838920	4842360	And being canceled on Twitter may be a form of abuse,
4842360	4844700	but it's not a form of oppression.
4844700	4847620	And I say this as someone, at this point,
4847620	4850560	most known for complaining about cancel culture.
4850560	4852220	Oh God, is this my legacy?
4852220	4854560	A lot of trans people have been very mean,
4854560	4857260	verbally abusive even, to JK Rowling.
4857260	4859500	But most people criticizing Joanne,
4859500	4861960	or criticizing me for that matter,
4861960	4865340	might be hurt and angry, but they're not violent.
4865340	4869120	But when you're receiving hundreds or thousands of messages
4869120	4872000	full of hurt and anger and hate,
4872000	4874280	you experience it as one huge,
4874280	4878580	tidal wave of loathing crashing over you all at once.
4878580	4882860	And that 0.1% of messages that really are violent,
4882860	4885640	they become emblematic of the way
4885640	4888560	the whole experience feels.
4888560	4891580	And if you've been the victim of abuse before,
4891580	4894160	the experience can be pretty triggering.
4894160	4897760	So it's just not always as simple as the victim
4897760	4899360	and the abuser.
4899360	4902080	Sometimes victims are also abusers.
4902080	4904200	Sometimes abusers have a history
4904200	4905520	of victimization.
4905520	4909440	Sometimes righteously angry people cross a line
4909440	4911260	into abusive excess.
4911260	4914640	And not all abuse comes from a position of power.
4914640	4916720	Why are so many trans people on Twitter
4916720	4920800	so easily driven to extremes of rage and aggression?
4920800	4923860	Well, there's a passage in Conflict is Not Abuse
4923860	4926700	that I think applies just as well to trans Twitter
4926700	4928520	as it does to TERFs.
4928520	4930600	People living in unrecovered trauma
4930600	4932580	often behave in very similar ways
4932580	4934180	to the people who traumatize them.
4934200	4936640	Over and over, I have seen traumatized people
4936640	4939400	refuse to hear or engage information
4939400	4941260	that would alter their self-concepts,
4941260	4942680	even in ways that could bring them
4942680	4944540	more happiness and integrity.
4944540	4947160	The undiscovered traumatized person's refusal
4947160	4949740	is rooted in a panic that their fragile self
4949740	4951480	cannot bear interrogation,
4951480	4954380	that whatever is keeping them together is not flexible.
4954380	4956220	Perhaps because supremacy in some
4956220	4958080	produces trauma in others,
4958080	4959900	they can become mirror images.
4959900	4961880	And of course, many perpetrators
4961880	4964080	were or are victims themselves.
4964200	4967860	A lot of TERFs have been treated very horribly by men,
4967860	4971500	and they misdirect some reflection of that abuse
4971500	4973820	at trans people, a vulnerable group
4973820	4976280	who they can mostly get away with hurting.
4976280	4978500	Unlike standing up to powerful men, right?
4978500	4981100	Which would be dangerous and difficult.
4981100	4984240	And a lot of trans people have been very horribly treated
4984240	4987840	by men, by TERFs, by strangers on the street,
4987840	4989480	by their own families.
4989480	4991480	And for some of those trans people,
4991480	4991640	canceling celebrities on Twitter is the worst thing.
4991640	4993680	canceling celebrities on Twitter is the worst thing.
4993680	4993820	canceling celebrities on Twitter is the worst thing.
4993820	4993860	canceling celebrities on Twitter is the worst thing.
4993860	4996360	is the one kind of power they have.
4996360	4999860	Plus, a lot of extremely online trans people
4999860	5002820	really don't have a strong sense of conviction
5002820	5004080	in their own identity,
5004080	5007020	which is why they need constant external validation
5007020	5008300	to prop them up.
5008300	5011540	They need to constantly be told that they're valid,
5011540	5014060	that they really are the gender that they say they are.
5014060	5017860	And if someone even obliquely threatens or questions
5017860	5021560	their fragile self-concept, they lash out,
5021560	5023580	Twitter being their only weapon.
5023580	5026320	You know, Joanne, you say at the end of your essay
5026320	5029220	that all you're asking, all you want,
5029220	5031040	is empathy and understanding.
5031040	5033860	And I've tried to extend that to you in this video.
5033860	5037460	But trans people also deserve more empathy and understanding
5037460	5038520	than you've given them.
5038520	5041380	Sometimes you should look at some of these Twitter accounts
5041380	5043480	that are always raging against you
5043480	5046200	and raging against me, for that matter.
5046200	5049680	In between the raging, look at what they're doing.
5049680	5053160	They're begging, begging for money to pay for healthcare,
5053160	5055360	begging for money to pay for housing.
5055360	5059580	You are worth hundreds of millions of dollars, Joanne,
5059580	5064580	or pounds, or Gringotts, or whatever you people have.
5064680	5066160	And trans people are out here
5066160	5068880	literally begging for healthcare.
5068880	5070620	They're begging, Joanne.
5070620	5074040	How powerful could the trans agenda really be?
5074040	5077300	Joanne, you have so much power and influence,
5077300	5080400	many, many times more than what I have.
5080400	5082940	And I have much more power and influence
5082940	5084740	than most trans people.
5084740	5086920	You know, I am in a very different situation
5086920	5088160	than most trans people.
5088160	5091080	I have a lot of other things going for me in this world,
5091080	5093680	but a lot of them have nothing.
5093680	5096180	They have nothing, Joanne.
5096180	5100320	And I just think you should take that into consideration
5100320	5102660	next time you decide to speak out
5102660	5105320	about how trans activists are oppressing you.
5106820	5108000	Get it together, Gorge.
5108000	5109260	Are you listening to yourself?
5109260	5110440	What are you doing, Joanne?
5110440	5112920	You know, a lot of trans people have gone through life,
5112940	5114940	being rejected, and humiliated,
5114940	5117600	and excluded over and over again.
5117600	5119100	So they're traumatized.
5119100	5121880	They're easily triggered by anything that reminds them
5121880	5124340	of past betrayal and abandonment,
5124340	5127460	which is something I think you could empathize with.
5127460	5130040	Joanne, you are famous for writing a book
5130040	5133460	about a neglected and abused boy who lives in a closet
5133460	5136220	until he's whisked away to a magical world
5136220	5137880	where he and his freaky friends
5137880	5139640	find acceptance in each other.
5139640	5141900	I remember when I first met you all.
5141900	5142820	Biggest bunch of-
5142820	5145260	Misfits I ever set eyes on.
5145260	5146700	We're still a bunch of misfits.
5146700	5149420	Well, maybe, but we've all got each other.
5149420	5153260	So many trans people have found comfort in this story
5153260	5154880	and an escape from a world
5154880	5158640	that doesn't offer a lot of comfort to trans people.
5158640	5161640	So for you to use your fame and influence
5161640	5165960	to rally the backlash against trans acceptance,
5165960	5168820	it feels like a betrayal to a lot of people.
5168820	5170940	And I don't blame them for feeling that way.
5170940	5172440	I feel it too.
5172440	5173400	So Joanne,
5174520	5175780	Jo,
5175780	5177040	mother,
5177040	5178560	I'm sorry about the Twitter mob.
5178560	5180480	I know how much that sucks.
5180480	5183540	So if you ever want to take me up on it,
5183540	5185640	I'll buy you a drink to apologize for that.
5185640	5187820	But otherwise, I think we're done here.
5187820	5189360	As a trans person,
5189360	5192140	I like to believe in the power of human metamorphosis,
5192140	5193760	but I realized that at this point,
5193760	5196700	you're being constantly love bombed by transphobes
5196700	5198900	and constantly trashed by trans people.
5198900	5202280	So it would be pretty difficult to change tracks at this point.
5202280	5204660	You'd be one in a million if you pulled that off.
5204660	5208300	And I don't know Joanne, maybe you are one in a million.
5208300	5209900	I mean, you wrote The Prisoner of Azkaban
5209900	5211600	and that shit got me through fifth grade.
5211600	5212840	So who knows?
5212840	5214600	Maybe you have another miracle in you.
5214600	5216820	But I'm too old to believe in magic now.
5216820	5220540	So I'm not gonna sit around waiting for a letter to Hogwarts.
5222120	5225020	Okay, I guess that's it.
5227480	5228940	Mischief managed.
5232280	5234940	Menu chef.
5234940	5236780	They don't have any special menu in the store.
5236780	5238520	I did.
5239780	5241280	Who are they?
5241280	5242840	I don't know that.
5242840	5245480	Well, I guess that's it for this episode.
5245480	5246420	See you next times at 15 grand.
5246420	5247920	Bye-bye.
5247920	5249740	McKlessar, Gib's not even that интересно.
5249740	5251260	He is.
5251260	5252880	See you next time!
5252880	5254180	Bye-bye.
5254180	5255240	And there you go again,
5255240	5257100	poshlyогоorinthisame.com.
5257100	5258460	Probably not a smartass.
5258460	5259880	But your退ence was close enough.
5259880	5260860	But yeah, who am I talking to right now?
5260860	5261880	Mischief managed.
5262280	5292260	Thank you.
5292280	5322260	Thank you.
5322280	5352260	Thank you.
5352280	5382260	Thank you.
5382280	5384840	Thank you.
