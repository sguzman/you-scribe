1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,980
Thank you for watching.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:59,980
I'll see you in the next one.

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,540
It's probably the most effective approach eventually,

4
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,140
but the problem is that it's hard

5
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,280
and I don't like things that are hard.

6
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,380
Because when you do things that are hard,

7
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,960
you have to feel bad now so that you can feel good later.

8
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,820
And I don't want to feel good later.

9
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,680
I want to feel good now.

10
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,320
And if you want to feel good now,

11
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,260
well, you have a couple options.

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,980
The first is, of course, to do drugs.

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,060
And I've tried that.

14
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,320
I spent most of my 20s on the threshold of alcoholism,

15
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,700
but it turns out that's not a cute look for me.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,680
It's not my vibe.

17
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,600
So what I do now when I feel the darkness coming

18
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,200
is what any respectable woman would do.

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,260
I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,920
Is it a pee under my mattress, your majesty?

21
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,120
Or is it another Xanax I left under the throat rug?

22
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,520
Now, the problem with doing drugs

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,460
is that when the drugs wear off, you feel bad again.

24
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,140
In fact, you probably feel worse.

25
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,800
So where do we go from here?

26
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,220
Well, how about music?

27
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,280
When you feel bad, you want to listen to sad music

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,920
because sad music makes you cry.

29
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,460
And crying feels good.

30
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,280
It's like an orgasm for sad people.

31
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,600
And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness?

32
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,540
The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel.

33
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,620
You know, I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax

34
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,840
under this throat rug.

35
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,820
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,040
But in the memes, you only hear the first 10 seconds of the song.

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,960
You only hear,

38
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,820
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

39
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,440
And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song,

40
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,480
which is good,

41
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,800
because if you're making songs for sad people,

42
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,740
it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,880
Because sad people don't like happy songs.

44
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,100
When you're sad,

45
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,820
happy songs make you feel like you're being bullshitted.

46
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,580
So we're 10 seconds into the song,

47
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,260
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

48
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:56,060
The key is D sharp minor, the saddest of all keys.

49
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,720
But when we get to the next line,

50
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,320
because of vision softly creeping,

51
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,220
something happens.

52
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,060
Let's listen.

53
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,260
I've come to talk with you again

54
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,880
Because a vision softly creeping

55
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,060
Ah!

56
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,480
What was that?

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,260
Suddenly a major chord,

58
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,440
an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds,

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,760
and every peach fuzz hair on the back

60
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,200
of my biologically female neck stands on end.

61
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,700
Hello, light.

62
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,280
So the song has enticed me

63
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,160
with its promise of company for misery,

64
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,040
and then it has tricked me into feeling good.

65
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,600
And that's what I like about art.

66
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,420
It takes the standard disappointments

67
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,840
and humiliations of life

68
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,660
and cooks them into something worth

69
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,100
getting off the floor for.

70
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,520
Unfortunately, I don't really play music much anymore

71
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:46,420
because my hands are too beautiful for instruments

72
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,240
and my singing voice sounds like a man.

73
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,540
So all I really have left is what any aspiring artist

74
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,060
with no talent turns to, comedy.

75
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,760
And I especially like dark comedy.

76
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,060
You know, comedy about the things in life

77
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,440
that are the most painful.

78
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,380
To me, dark humor is kind of like a sad song.

79
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,140
It takes your worst feelings, traumas, and anxieties

80
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,660
and twists them into a source of pleasure.

81
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,660
And don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?

82
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,500
Ah!

83
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,060
A lot of the time, that means joking about topics

84
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,480
that in ordinary life are considered taboo.

85
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,760
You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

86
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,620
Without the ability to joke and make fun

87
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,720
of my own experiences of self-loathing,

88
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,200
substance abuse, gender dysphoria,

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:28,640
I mean, I'd probably be the one to say,

90
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,340
I'd probably be on the floor right now

91
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,960
looking for that Xanax.

92
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,220
But this puts me in a difficult situation

93
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,060
because I want to defend my sense of humor,

94
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,580
which I feel is like the core of my personality

95
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,880
and what keeps me alive.

96
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,760
But at the same time, I've noticed that a lot of the people

97
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,940
in our culture who are really big on defending provocative,

98
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:48,840
controversial, politically incorrect comedy

99
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:52,400
are kind of dick nuggets.

100
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,640
Let's discuss this.

101
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,880
And by discuss, I mean use it quietly

102
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,960
and I'll tell you what to think.

103
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,580
Two, dick nuggets.

104
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,720
So the year 2016 had just begun

105
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,900
and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.

106
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,920
Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian,

107
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,100
was ranting on Twitter for days and days

108
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:15,780
about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.

109
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,540
This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais,

110
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,380
a man whose personal branding screams,

111
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,660
I don't care about your feelings.

112
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,200
I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs.

113
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,300
I am too much of a badass rebel

114
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,720
to care what minorities think.

115
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,380
But in January 2016, Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass,

116
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,480
irreverent, not caring about your feelings kind of month.

117
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,540
Why?

118
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,200
Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes

119
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,440
and upset a bunch of people by telling jokes

120
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,800
about old Tran Ma Caitlyn Jenner.

121
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,560
But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight.

122
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,860
I've changed.

123
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,100
Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.

124
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,020
That's cutting edge material there, Rick.

125
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:56,960
Very irreverent.

126
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,400
Very rebellious.

127
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,340
Very bad boy atheist.

128
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:03,500
I mean, I do wish he wouldn't deadname trans people on stage,

129
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,680
but honestly, the joke wasn't even as transphobic

130
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,200
as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.

131
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:13,200
Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it,

132
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,300
and Ricky spent the rest of the month tweeting

133
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,080
about how offending people is good, actually,

134
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,720
and he definitely doesn't care that people were offended.

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,640
But clearly, Twitter got to him,

136
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,240
because two years later, he opened his Netflix special

137
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,200
with a 13-minute bit, rehabbing, and saying,

138
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,200
and doing a series of even more, um, irreverent jokes.

139
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?

140
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
Well, I am a chimp.

141
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
If I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp.

142
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Pre-op.

143
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:42,200
But, um, and don't ever deadname me.

144
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,200
Don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again.

145
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:46,200
From now on, you call me Bobo.

146
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?

147
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,200
Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage

148
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,200
in a $20 million comedy special?

149
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,320
My issue with this joke is that, you know, I don't know.

150
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,320
My issue with this joke is that, apart from being extremely passé and overdone,

151
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,320
it also doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe

152
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
that trans women are delusional men.

153
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
And even then, it's just not very funny.

154
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,320
But am I offended by the joke?

155
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,320
Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed, unoriginal, and not very funny.

156
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,320
And as a great comedian named Ricky Gervais once said,

157
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:23,320
to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame, badly delivered, and not funny enough.

158
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
So by that measure, yes, I'd say this.

159
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,320
The fact that I identify as a chimp bit is pretty offensive.

160
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,320
But I'm not bringing this old controversy up because I'm offended.

161
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,320
I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example of a cycle

162
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,320
it seems like our culture repeats about once a week.

163
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,320
Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke,

164
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,320
and other people are indignant about the fact that those people are offended.

165
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,320
The cycle usually gets framed as a battle and a culture war

166
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,320
that's supposedly going on between generation snowflake,

167
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,320
easily triggered, humorless PC cucks,

168
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
and badass, edgy, nothing-off-limits,

169
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
free-speech truth-tellers.

170
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,320
Now if this really is a culture war between two sides,

171
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
then I am a double agent,

172
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:06,320
because I'm a generation snowflake PC cuck who loves dank, edgy memes,

173
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,320
and I've found myself on both sides of this type of conflict many, many times.

174
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,320
So on the one hand, when I see the internet roasting a comedian

175
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,320
for some shitty trans joke,

176
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,320
my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.

177
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,320
But my inner edge lady knows how it feels to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.

178
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:28,320
And as someone who basically writes jokes about controversial topics for a living,

179
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:35,320
I appreciate how difficult it is to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy

180
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,320
while also keeping your moral compass from getting too jittery.

181
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,320
So what I want to try to do is step away from the heat of these social media battles

182
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,320
and try to abstract from them some more general philosophical questions.

183
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,320
What is the purpose of comedy?

184
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,320
What is it that makes comedy good or bad?

185
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?

186
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:59,320
Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?

187
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Is it, as Aristotle said,

188
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,320
the imitation of worse than average men?

189
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at for whatever reason?

190
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
Well, I don't think there's a single objective answer.

191
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
I mean, comedy's pretty subjective.

192
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,320
But we can probably reach some kind of understanding by discussing this, right?

193
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
And by we,

194
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
again, I do mean me.

195
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,320
The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouths shut.

196
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Straw men.

197
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
So, as a trans woman,

198
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,320
up here discussing why I don't think Ricky Gervais' trans jokes are funny,

199
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,320
a lot of haters and losers out there are probably gonna try to straw man me.

200
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,320
Did you just assume the straw person's gender?

201
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Ugh!

202
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Cis people have like two trans jokes and they're both so bad.

203
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Here's the straw person's, assholes.

204
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Straw person one.

205
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,320
You hate free speech

206
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:51,320
and are trying to silence comedians.

207
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
I'm not trying to silence anyone.

208
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Comedians can say whatever they want on stage

209
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
and I can say whatever I want about them.

210
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Straw person two.

211
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,320
You just can't take the heat when the joke's on you.

212
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
I transitioned on YouTube,

213
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
making controversial political content all the while,

214
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
and I read the comments.

215
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,320
My hate-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.

216
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Of course, I do not have the internalized self-loathing

217
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
that has damaged my psyche irreparably,

218
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
but sweetie, who doesn't?

219
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
Straw person three.

220
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,320
You think no one should be allowed to joke about trans people.

221
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,320
I invented joking about trans people.

222
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Ever heard of the mouth feel?

223
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,320
I'm that tran.

224
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,320
That's right.

225
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,320
If I die tomorrow,

226
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,320
my legacy will be that I applied wine-tasting terminology to fellatio,

227
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,320
and I accept my destiny.

228
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.

229
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
I live for trans jokes.

230
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,320
I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them,

231
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
because they don't know enough about trans people

232
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
to know what the funny things are.

233
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
And being transgender is honestly the perfect topic for comedy.

234
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
Like, you used to live as one gender,

235
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
and then you became a different gender.

236
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,320
Every single thing about that is absolutely hilarious.

237
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
But humor is in the details.

238
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
And Ricky Gervais does not know the details,

239
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,320
because he's clearly never been close to a trans person,

240
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,320
and that's why he's still telling these Tinker Toy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner jokes.

241
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
And it's too bad,

242
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
because I'm actually starving over here for good trans comedy.

243
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
And I mean the real dark stuff, too.

244
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline

245
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
calling her hormones titty skittles.

246
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,320
No, I like the edgy stuff.

247
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
I like being on the edge.

248
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen,

249
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,320
and I enjoy edging.

250
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy

251
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,320
that I'd like to share with you,

252
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
because when you're doing art criticism,

253
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,320
it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.

254
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,320
And the exemplary work I have in mind

255
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,320
is one not a lot of people are talking about yet,

256
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,320
but which I have no qualms placing in the same company

257
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
as the works of Dante or Swift.

258
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,320
I am, of course, referring to

259
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,320
My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgias.

260
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
If you don't know who Gigi is,

261
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,320
first of all, who even are you?

262
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Do you have no respect for legends?

263
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
She's a trans YouTuber,

264
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,320
like the trans YouTuber,

265
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,320
whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids

266
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
and I Had Sex With a Dog

267
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,320
long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.

268
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
But in this critic's opinion,

269
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,320
the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre

270
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,320
is without a doubt,

271
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,320
the singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.

272
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,320
Let's do a close reading.

273
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:22,320
4. Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience

274
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,320
A great work of literature is never just a text.

275
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:29,320
It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson

276
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:33,320
would call a moment within an intertextual dialectic.

277
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Love that.

278
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience

279
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
within its proper context.

280
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Several months earlier, Gigi had released a video

281
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
about how she and her girlfriend

282
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,320
were trying to have a child,

283
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,320
so far without success,

284
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,320
and so they went to see a fertility specialist.

285
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Apparently Gigi was not aware

286
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile,

287
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,320
which, girl, they tell you like seven times

288
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
before you start hormones.

289
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Like, how?

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
We'll move past it.

291
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
A few months later,

292
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,320
the notification for My Sperm Bank Experience

293
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,320
shows up on my phone,

294
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
because that's right, I clicked the bell,

295
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,320
and immediately I knew I was about to experience

296
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
something special.

297
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
The thumbnail for this video is so much greater

298
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
than anything I've ever conceived of

299
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
that honestly it makes me feel like a failure,

300
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
both as a YouTuber and as a woman.

301
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,320
The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature,

302
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
the eyes are dotted with hearts,

303
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,320
and her facial expression.

304
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
Ew.

305
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Come.

306
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
The video begins with Gigi explaining

307
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
that in order to produce a sample for the clinic,

308
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,320
she had to stop taking hormones for three months.

309
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,320
So I hesitantly agreed.

310
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
I was like, fine, I will stop all of my hormones,

311
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,320
so, you know, my shit can get juicy again,

312
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,320
and I can get a good little sample up in here.

313
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,320
The sperm bank day arrives,

314
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,320
she goes to the clinic,

315
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
and approaches the receptionist.

316
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,320
And I said,

317
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,320
yes, ma'am,

318
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I am here to give sperm

319
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,320
from me

320
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
to be frozen

321
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
now.

322
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room,

323
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
which she describes with the precision

324
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
of Mama Flaubert.

325
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,320
I walk into this room,

326
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
fluorescent lighting,

327
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,320
the house.

328
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
I was like, I can see every pore in my arm,

329
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
like, Jesus, what do they want me to do here?

330
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
And then the kicker,

331
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
this, like, leather couch,

332
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
the back is kind of, like, angled,

333
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
so I guess, like, you can lean

334
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,320
and really get into it or something.

335
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
The doctor offers her lubrication,

336
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,320
pornography if needed,

337
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,320
and a donation cup.

338
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Gigi closes the door and gets to work.

339
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,320
I get in the mood,

340
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,320
I get in the zone,

341
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,320
and I'm killing it, bitch.

342
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
I am like, I'm gonna give the best sample ever.

343
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,320
My kid is gonna be a God-sent child.

344
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,320
Before I know it,

345
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
the moment has crept up on me and happened,

346
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
and it's been so long

347
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,320
that it hits the wall behind me.

348
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,320
And it's at this moment

349
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
that glam goddess Gigi Gorgeous

350
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
gets up off the leather couch

351
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
and attempts to scrape

352
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
a prodigious quantity of Gigi jism

353
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:46,320
off the wall of a fluorescent-lit exam room

354
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,320
in a desperate final bid to become a mother.

355
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
And I took the cup,

356
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,320
and I was, like, full-on, like,

357
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
scraping it off the wall,

358
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
because I was like,

359
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
I'm not gonna let any little drop go to waste.

360
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
You know, I'm here.

361
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
This is, like, my moment.

362
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
I'm trying to understand

363
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,320
why this video makes me laugh so much.

364
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
It's really the contrast of style and substance.

365
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Like, it wouldn't be funny

366
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:06,320
if a masculine person told this story.

367
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
It's funny because Gigi has this

368
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
peak feminine storytelling style

369
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
in this Real Housewives diction,

370
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,320
but the story itself is about

371
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
blasting a giant load onto a wall

372
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
of a room full of leather and pornography.

373
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,320
The dissonance between form and content

374
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
is genius in that dissonance

375
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
perfectly captures the absurdity

376
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
of being transgender

377
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,320
with a comedic incisiveness

378
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,320
that Ricky Gervais could only dream of.

379
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
I also really relate to this story

380
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
because right before I started Hormones,

381
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
I decided to freeze a sample of my own

382
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:38,320
so I, too, have a sperm bank experience.

383
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
And it was exactly like Gigi describes,

384
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
down to every detail.

385
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,320
It is not a dignified moment, ladies.

386
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
There is just no way to feel like a woman

387
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
while you're hastily rubbing one out

388
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,320
in an over-lit room designed for men to ejaculate in.

389
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I feel so fish right now.

390
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
For this five minutes in the exam room,

391
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
I was a man.

392
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,320
Now, I somehow managed to get most of my sample

393
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
into the cup,

394
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
but there's a different absurd detail to my story.

395
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
The receptionist at the sperm bank

396
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
saw on my paperwork that I was depositing

397
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
because I was going to start feminizing hormones.

398
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:10,320
And he asked me if there was a name I preferred he called me.

399
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
In retrospect, he was actually really sweet

400
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
and really cute.

401
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Not that anything was going to come of that at the time,

402
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,320
since I was pretty everything and rough around the edges.

403
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Be honest, I was all edges.

404
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
But he asked me for my preferred name,

405
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
and I just blurted out Natalie.

406
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,320
And so this was actually the first time

407
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
anyone ever called me by my biological name.

408
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,320
And it went like this.

409
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
The receptionist at the sperm bank

410
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,320
turned to me and said,

411
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
right this way, Natalie.

412
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Here's a cup for you to bust a nut in.

413
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,320
And that's how it went.

414
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
And that's how my life as a woman began.

415
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,320
Now in the end,

416
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,320
Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.

417
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,320
Her sample wasn't usable.

418
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
She wanted to have a child with her own DNA,

419
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
but she's been on hormones too long,

420
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,320
and she just can't.

421
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
And that revelation at the end of the video

422
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole story.

423
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
In this ridiculous image of Gigi

424
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
scraping ejaculate off the wall,

425
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
I now see this primal maternal urge

426
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
to produce and protect children.

427
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen

428
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
prematurely from the nest.

429
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
I see the Virgin Mary cradling her child.

430
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,320
I really, really thought that I was going to have

431
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
a good sample and I was going to be able to participate

432
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
in having a baby with my DNA,

433
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
but it's just not on the cards for me.

434
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,320
And I really wanted to make this video more positive

435
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,320
and funny because there is nothing I can do.

436
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,320
And that's exactly it.

437
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,320
That is the darkness.

438
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
The darkness is my name for what I consider

439
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
the highest form of comedy,

440
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
where you take your own worst feelings,

441
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
traumas, and anxieties,

442
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,320
and twist them into a source of pleasure.

443
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
The darkness is Richard Pryor

444
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
running down the street in flames

445
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
because he set himself on fire in a coke-fueled psychosis.

446
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
The darkness is Gigi Gorgeous

447
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
scraping her own prodigious jism

448
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
off the wall of an exam room

449
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.

450
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
If you can make these low points funny,

451
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
then you're gonna be okay.

452
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
You're gonna survive.

453
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,320
You're gonna make it through life.

454
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
And I need that now more than ever

455
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
because trans experience is,

456
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
in a lot of ways, pretty dark.

457
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
But trans people make it through because

458
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
we're good-humored and strong as fuck.

459
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to stop hormones

460
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
before an operation, and I'm terrified of that.

461
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
What's gonna happen to me when I stop hormones?

462
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
Am I gonna become a man again?

463
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Because I don't know if I can handle that.

464
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
I am thinking about names, though.

465
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
Like, maybe Nathan? Or Jaden?

466
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
I can see myself as a Jaden.

467
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
See, I've gotta have my little jokey jokes,

468
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
or I don't think I can make it through this.

469
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
Like, when I have bottom surgery,

470
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it as

471
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,320
my sex change operation.

472
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
Because it makes me laugh. It brings me joy.

473
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
Calling it gender confirmation surgery

474
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,320
brings me no joy.

475
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
Now, it's important to notice that just because

476
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
it doesn't make me laugh doesn't mean

477
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
it's a politically correct euphemism.

478
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Gender confirmation is a more accurate term

479
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:51,320
than sex change, because

480
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
you're literally not changing your sex.

481
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
That's not what surgery does.

482
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,320
But edgy people have their own kind of political

483
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
correctness, where they mistake

484
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
edginess for honesty, accuracy,

485
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,320
and directness. But these are very

486
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
different things. For example,

487
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
George Carlin has a classic bit about euphemisms

488
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
that has some great moments,

489
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,320
but also some moments that are

490
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
way off-base. For example,

491
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
content wording ableist slur.

492
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,320
They say they're going to pre-board those

493
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,320
passengers in need of special assistance.

494
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,320
Cripples!

495
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Simple, honest, direct language!

496
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
So look, I understand the aesthetic

497
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
preference for simple, honest, direct

498
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
language, and the repulsion toward

499
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
verbose, bureaucratic jargon. That's why

500
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,320
so much of the rest of this bit is so good.

501
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,320
But the word he just used is literally

502
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
a slur, so I wonder if what you're being honest

503
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,320
about is your feelings toward disabled

504
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,320
people. Because the phrase passengers

505
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,320
in need of special assistance is a little wordy,

506
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,320
sure, but in this situation

507
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,320
it's actually more accurate, since it also

508
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,320
includes the elderly, the pregnant, anyone

509
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,320
in need of assistance boarding.

510
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:55,320
So I call my gender confirmation surgery

511
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,320
getting a sex change, not because it's more

512
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,320
direct and honest, but specifically

513
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
because it's inaccurate and outdated.

514
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
And that makes me laugh.

515
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:05,320
Not because I'm a fearless truth teller, but

516
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
because I'm a bad person.

517
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,320
And I get to call it my sex change operation,

518
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
but cis people don't get to call it

519
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
that, because it's my darkness,

520
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
not yours. Get your

521
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
own darkness. When Ricky Gervais jokes about

522
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
trans people, he's being a hack,

523
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,320
because he knows nothing of our darkness.

524
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,320
And when someone tries to joke about something that they're

525
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
totally ignorant of, the result is usually

526
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
clumsy, awkward, and not very

527
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
funny. What I'd really like to see is

528
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
if Ricky Gervais took all of that irreverent

529
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,320
bad boy derisiveness and

530
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,320
turned it within. Because

531
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
within is where the darkness

532
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,320
lies.

533
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite

534
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,320
because as a lazy, selfish,

535
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,320
preening attention whore

536
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,320
who looks like a slightly more passable Ann Coulter

537
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
with the voice of a tropical bird,

538
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
there's a lot of material here to work with.

539
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
But especially when it comes to the trans jokes,

540
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,320
there is a faction of the

541
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
trans community that is not

542
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
amused by the buffoonery that goes on

543
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
on this channel. I think the objection

544
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,320
to it is best summed up by the comic

545
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
artist Diana Gadsby, who in her stand-up special

546
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,320
Nanette, said that when

547
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,320
self-deprecation comes from someone who

548
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
exists in the margins,

549
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,320
It's not humility.

550
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,320
It's humiliation.

551
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
And to be honest, I felt a little

552
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
called out by that.

553
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
I put myself down in order to speak.

554
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,320
In order to seek permission

555
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:27,320
to speak.

556
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
And she's not wrong, like that is how this works.

557
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
In order to gain an audience as a trans

558
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
person, you have to demonstrate

559
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,320
what cis people call self-awareness.

560
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,320
That is, you have to signal

561
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
that you see yourself the way

562
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
the audience sees you.

563
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Which can mean looking at yourself with a pretty

564
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
merciless gaze. And of course I'm

565
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
happy to do that, cause I have no

566
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
self-respect and laughter is the only way

567
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,320
to numb the pain. But the terrible thing

568
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
about being a not normal with an audience

569
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
is that you don't just get to be yourself.

570
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Because whether you like it or not,

571
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
people will see you as a

572
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
representative of the community.

573
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Ugh.

574
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
So because of that responsibility, which I never

575
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,320
asked for, I have to balance out

576
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
the self-deprecation with a lot

577
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,320
of positive messaging about my people.

578
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
And that way, the dark jokes

579
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
function as a spoonful of

580
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
sugar to help the feminine

581
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
penis go down. But even without

582
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
the group representation issue,

583
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
it definitely is possible to take

584
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
self-deprecation too far.

585
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,320
As I've said, I have been diagnosed

586
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,320
with an incurable edginess of

587
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,320
temperament, and I sometimes do feel

588
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
suffocated by the safe space rules

589
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,320
of a lot of trans spaces, even though

590
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
those spaces are there for good reason

591
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,320
and a lot of people need them. But sometimes

592
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:41,320
this atmosphere of everything and everyone

593
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:43,320
is valid all the time, no

594
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
uncomfortable questions may be asked,

595
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,320
any self-deprecation is a sign

596
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,320
of traumatic internalized bigotry,

597
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,320
I just need to get out of there for a

598
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
while and find a place where I can relax

599
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,320
and be my edgy self.

600
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:57,320
I need a safe space for my edginess,

601
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
where I can just blurt out whatever

602
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,320
stupid question or joke comes to mind

603
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,320
without being afraid that I'm gonna

604
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
inflict horrible trauma on everyone around me.

605
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,320
So I call up another

606
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,320
transsexual edgelady, you know,

607
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,320
kiki, accuse each other of being cross-dressers,

608
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,320
and just laugh it all off.

609
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
And it's so so cathartic to

610
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,320
do that, but it does have

611
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
to be done in moderation, cause

612
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,320
there can come a point where you're picking at

613
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,320
the wound instead of numbing it.

614
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,320
And it mostly has to be done in private,

615
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,320
because in public, you have to worry

616
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
about how cis people will interpret

617
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
it, and so you have to find a way to

618
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
be self-deprecating without a

619
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,320
social responsibility.

620
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,320
Ugh, if there was ever a phrase that

621
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,320
instantly deadens all laughter, it's

622
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,320
social responsibility. But since

623
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
it's kind of the central topic of the comedy

624
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
culture war, I should probably say

625
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
something about it, even though, believe

626
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
me, I'd much rather go back to

627
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
jabbering about my sex change.

628
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
So what is a comedian's

629
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
job? What is a comedian supposed to

630
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
do? I suppose my ideal comedian

631
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
is one who is perfectly able to

632
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
balance the tension between shit

633
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
posting and snowflakery.

634
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
And this is an eternal tension,

635
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
and must never be resolved.

636
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
It is a tightrope I have devoted my

637
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
life to walking. See, if the tension

638
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
collapses into pure snowflakery,

639
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
you get a moralist who might

640
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
say that a comedian's purpose is to

641
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,320
promote justice by punching up,

642
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
by speaking truth to power, by

643
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,320
exposing the flaws of bigoted mindsets,

644
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
and so on. And these are all very admirable

645
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
goals, but they leave out what I

646
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
think is the essential purpose of comedy,

647
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
which is to be funny.

648
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,320
To surprise, to shock, to make

649
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,320
people laugh. It's kind of like how some

650
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
art and media critics only ever evaluate

651
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,320
a work based on whether or not it's socially

652
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,320
progressive, and don't seem to really

653
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
think about aesthetic pleasure very

654
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
much, which, to me, is the

655
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,320
reason why art exists in the first place.

656
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,320
But then again, I am a hedonistic

657
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
bourgeois decadent, and should probably

658
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,320
be sent to the guillotine at once.

659
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:57,320
Just let me do my makeup first, so that when they hold my head

660
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
up, everyone can see my beat, and their wings all

661
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,320
fly to the Bastille. Also, someone please post

662
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
the video to my Instagram, cause that's

663
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
gonna get a lot of engagement.

664
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
So the opposite of the pure snowflake

665
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,320
is the pure shit poster,

666
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,320
who might say that a comedian's purpose is to make

667
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
an audience laugh by any means necessary.

668
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,320
But that seems kinda barbaric,

669
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
since, like, if a guard at a prison

670
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
camp is torturing an inmate, and the other

671
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
guards are laughing, does that count

672
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
as comedy? Is a war crime funny?

673
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Well, according to the Geneva Convention,

674
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,320
it's hilarious.

675
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
The thing is, I don't think many comedians

676
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
actually believe in a completely

677
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,320
nihilistic vision of comedy.

678
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,320
I think they sometimes pretend to,

679
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,320
when they're trying to evade criticism.

680
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,320
I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics,

681
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
and listen to the way they talk about their

682
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,320
heroes, Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.

683
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,320
There's always an element of admiration

684
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
for bravery, risk,

685
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,320
subversion, truth-telling. In other words,

686
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,320
there's a concern there for what is virtuous

687
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,320
and what is true, not just

688
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
for what makes people laugh. So maybe,

689
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
before we can even talk about what's funny,

690
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
we have to have a level of shared agreement

691
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,320
about what is true and what is morally right.

692
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,320
My objection to Ricky Gervais'

693
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,320
trans jokes is not just that they're not

694
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,320
funny. I think he's wrong about

695
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,320
trans people, and I think his ignorance

696
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
is infectious. I think he's

697
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
stirring up bigoted sentiments in his

698
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
audience, which has the consequence

699
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
of making the world slightly scarier

700
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
for people like me. And this is

701
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
edginess at its worst. Just a

702
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
privileged person with a platform

703
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,320
punching down at a politically besieged group

704
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
he understands nothing about. And that's

705
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,320
what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension

706
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,320
collapses into pure shitposting.

707
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,320
It's boring.

708
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
And immature. Like when someone says

709
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,320
he wants to watch the world burn.

710
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
You only get to watch when you have the privilege

711
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,320
of not being on fire.

712
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,320
It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.

713
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,320
The darkness is finding

714
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,320
a way to laugh about being

715
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
on fire. Edginess is always

716
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
adolescent. The darkness

717
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
is edginess aged by

718
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
time and pain. And it's only

719
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
at that full maturity that comedy

720
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
becomes art. That it becomes

721
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
comparable to music.

722
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
So, those are my thoughts.

723
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
Like, comment, and

724
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
subscribe.

725
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
The end.

726
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,320
Fine, I'll sing the song.

727
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
I wish my brother George was here.

728
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
Hello darkness

729
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
my old friend.

730
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,320
I've come to talk with you

731
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
again.

732
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,320
Because a vision

733
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:37,320
softly creeping

734
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
left its seeds while I was

735
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
sleeping.

736
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
And the vision

737
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,320
that was

738
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,320
planted in my

739
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
brain

740
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
still remains

741
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
within the sound

742
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
of silence.

743
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,320
In restless dreams

744
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
I walked alone.

745
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:07,320
Narrow streets of

746
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,320
cobblestone.

747
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,320
Neath the

748
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,320
halo of a

749
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
street lamp.

750
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,320
I turned my collar

751
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,320
to the cold and damp.

752
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,320
When my

753
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,320
eyes were stopped

754
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,320
by the flash of a

755
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,320
neon light.

756
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,320
That split the night

757
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
and touched

758
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,320
the sound.

759
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Of silence.

760
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
And in the

761
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,320
naked light I

762
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,320
saw

763
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,320
ten thousand people

764
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
maybe more.

765
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,320
People talking without

766
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,320
speaking.

767
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
People hearing

768
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,320
without listening.

769
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:57,320
People

770
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:59,320
writing songs

771
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
that

772
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
voices never

773
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,320
share.

774
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,320
No one dared

775
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
disturb the sound

776
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,320
of

777
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,320
silence.

778
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,320
Stay

779
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,320
gorgeous.
