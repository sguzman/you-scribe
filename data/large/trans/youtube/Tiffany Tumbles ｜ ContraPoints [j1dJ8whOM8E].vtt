00:00.000 --> 00:12.720
Hi guys! It's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube sensation. Welcome to my world! Every

00:12.720 --> 00:19.280
week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials. Come get ready with me! So I'm going to go in

00:19.280 --> 00:26.240
with the color Snowflake from my Winter Rose palette using a flaunt 325 brush. Smoke it out.

00:26.240 --> 00:32.560
Do you want to just kind of judge it? That looks bomb. It's major. I'm vibing it. I'm obsessed.

00:32.560 --> 00:43.360
It's literally snatched. Love, love, love. Yes. Okay. I'm not living for it. Oh my god.

00:44.480 --> 00:50.560
I think I glued my eyes shut. Fuck. But I'm not just a pretty face. I also share plenty

00:50.560 --> 00:55.040
of opinions about controversial social and political issues. Even though I'm trans,

00:55.040 --> 00:56.240
I refuse to be.

00:56.240 --> 01:01.760
a victim because I prefer to take control of my own life, which is why I support our president,

01:01.760 --> 01:06.560
Donald J. Trump. Make traps gay again. Bye!

01:24.480 --> 01:26.000
Hi! I'm Jackie

01:26.240 --> 01:32.320
Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, where- I'm sorry, why does my studio look like a Japanese

01:32.320 --> 01:39.760
drag queen redecorated an Italian bordello? It's hard to move past it. Anyway, tonight my guests

01:39.760 --> 01:44.400
are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political spectrum, but I've brought them

01:44.400 --> 01:49.120
here together to engage in a rational, free-thinking debate about a timeless question.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.920
Are traps gay?

01:56.240 --> 02:01.120
First guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series Intersectional AF.

02:01.840 --> 02:02.640
Clarence?

02:02.640 --> 02:08.400
Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria. Have you ever considered that transphobia is racist?

02:09.680 --> 02:14.960
Okay. My other guest is returning to the show. It's Tiffany Tumbles. Now, Tiffany,

02:14.960 --> 02:18.800
you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this program, isn't that right?

02:18.800 --> 02:23.440
That's right, Jackie. It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.080
You poor thing. Could you say a little bit about how you came-

02:26.080 --> 02:27.840
I came to take the red pill.

02:27.840 --> 02:31.120
Well, I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders,

02:31.120 --> 02:36.160
and how I was tired of trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans,

02:36.160 --> 02:41.120
and next thing I know, everyone's calling me a TERF and a traitor, so I said, you know what?

02:41.120 --> 02:44.720
I'm out. I'm not gonna put up with this culture of silencing and shame.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.200
I think that's just so brave of you.

02:47.200 --> 02:51.520
Yeah, wow, so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are.

02:51.520 --> 02:56.000
Shut up, Adria. I had just come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online.

02:56.080 --> 03:01.520
And then like that, the trans community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support. Nothing.

03:01.520 --> 03:05.040
I was absolutely alone. Do you have any idea what that felt like?

03:05.040 --> 03:09.760
Your leftist allies are not your friends, Adria. One wrong move and you're dead to them.

03:09.760 --> 03:10.880
Those are not friends.

03:10.880 --> 03:13.120
Well, you have real friends now, Tiffany.

03:13.120 --> 03:16.880
I think you're gonna fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals

03:16.880 --> 03:19.920
who are finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left

03:19.920 --> 03:22.720
and speaking out against politically correct dogma.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.520
Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?

03:26.080 --> 03:29.680
So I'm gonna go in with a highlighter, pop it on my cheeks,

03:30.320 --> 03:34.400
pop it on my brow till I'm literally blinding.

03:34.400 --> 03:35.760
I am glowing.

03:36.800 --> 03:39.840
She's doing all right, but I'm not living for it.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.320
You know what else I'm not living for?

03:43.600 --> 03:44.960
The Muslims.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.360
Tiffany, you are so funny.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.000
I'm sorry, are we just gonna ignore the blatant racism?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.120
How is that racist?

03:51.120 --> 03:52.880
Muslims are a religion, not a race.

03:52.880 --> 03:55.680
Yeah, Adria, Muslims are a religion, not a race.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.960
Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied together.

03:58.960 --> 03:59.600
You can't just...

04:00.400 --> 04:02.560
Look, you both know exactly what I'm talking about.

04:02.560 --> 04:04.240
Let's try to get back on track here.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.880
So, Adria, traps.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.800
Are they gay?

04:08.800 --> 04:10.800
Look, there's so many things wrong with the question

04:10.800 --> 04:13.280
that the only way to answer it is to deconstruct it.

04:13.280 --> 04:15.040
First of all, what are traps?

04:15.040 --> 04:16.160
Are they trans women?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.920
Because if you're calling trans women traps,

04:17.920 --> 04:22.160
then you're directly playing into the lie that trans women are tricking or trapping men.

04:22.160 --> 04:25.520
A lie that reinforces the mentality that causes men to murder us.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.320
Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.440
What about anime?

04:29.440 --> 04:33.040
Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.640
The Japanese word is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.640
There's no implication of tricking men.

04:38.640 --> 04:42.720
But the word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.560
So when you tell us that's not what it means,

04:44.560 --> 04:47.840
you're gaslighting the shit out of us because we've all heard it used as a slur.

04:47.840 --> 04:50.080
Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women.

04:50.080 --> 04:52.080
We're not all offended all the time.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.320
I actually happen to identify as a trap.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.600
Yeah, Adria, she identifies.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.720
She identifies as a trap.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.720
Well, she's in the sunken place.

04:58.720 --> 05:00.400
And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.720
Doesn't it bother you at all that if some guy murders you,

05:02.720 --> 05:03.760
his defense is gonna be,

05:03.760 --> 05:05.920
well, she was a trap, I was tricked.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.840
And you'll have contributed to that way of thinking.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.280
Well, what do you care, Adria?

05:09.280 --> 05:11.200
No one's gonna be trapped by you anyway.

05:11.200 --> 05:12.560
Oh, spicy.

05:12.560 --> 05:13.920
The fuck did you just say?

05:13.920 --> 05:17.200
I said, no shade, but you don't really look like a woman.

05:17.200 --> 05:20.080
Jackie, are you gonna allow your guest to talk to me like this?

05:20.080 --> 05:22.800
Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.520
Look, dragging bitches is what I do.

05:25.520 --> 05:27.200
Facts over feels, hunty.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.760
Well, Adria, don't you think she has a bit of a point?

05:29.760 --> 05:31.600
Like, if you wanna be taken seriously,

05:31.600 --> 05:33.280
you could put a little more effort in.

05:33.280 --> 05:35.440
I mean, what is this, a men's shirt?

05:35.440 --> 05:37.520
How are you gonna attract men with that?

05:37.520 --> 05:39.520
I'm not trying to attract men.

05:39.520 --> 05:40.560
I'm a lesbian.

05:40.560 --> 05:43.040
I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question,

05:43.040 --> 05:46.800
but how can you be a trans woman and a lesbian?

05:46.800 --> 05:49.840
Well, I'm a woman and I like women.

05:49.840 --> 05:51.200
I don't know about that.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.160
Sounds debatable.

05:52.160 --> 05:54.560
I'm sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show

05:54.560 --> 05:55.280
that I was signing up

05:55.280 --> 05:56.800
for the transphobia special.

05:56.800 --> 05:58.400
Transphobia?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.720
Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.240
I mean, I've invited two trans women to be on my program

06:04.240 --> 06:06.720
and I'll have you know that one of my best friends

06:06.720 --> 06:08.480
happens to be a gay man.

06:08.480 --> 06:11.040
And what could be transphobic about that?

06:11.040 --> 06:12.480
See, Adria, you're the reason

06:12.480 --> 06:14.160
why everyone hates trans people.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.240
You're obnoxious and offended by everything

06:16.240 --> 06:17.600
and everyone feels like they have to tread

06:17.600 --> 06:18.720
on eggshells around you.

06:18.720 --> 06:19.760
Thank you, Tiffany.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.280
See, you're one of the good ones.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.320
You're a good trans.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.480
Is this what you wanna do with your life, Tiffany?

06:24.480 --> 06:25.200
Be the laptop?

06:25.200 --> 06:26.640
Dog of people like this?

06:26.640 --> 06:27.200
No.

06:27.200 --> 06:29.920
I wanna actually work toward the acceptance of trans people

06:29.920 --> 06:31.840
by being patient and agreeable

06:31.840 --> 06:33.040
and by looking the part

06:33.040 --> 06:34.800
and not by screeching transphobia

06:34.800 --> 06:35.680
at everyone who doesn't meet

06:35.680 --> 06:37.440
your impossible standard of wokeness.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.160
And you're gonna do that by identifying as a trap, huh?

06:40.160 --> 06:42.400
Just keep reinforcing and excusing bigotry

06:42.400 --> 06:43.840
until it magically goes away.

06:43.840 --> 06:45.280
Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany,

06:45.280 --> 06:46.560
that you're not gaining acceptance

06:46.560 --> 06:47.920
for anyone but yourself

06:47.920 --> 06:49.200
and the only reason you're accepted

06:49.200 --> 06:50.960
is that you don't challenge the status quo?

06:50.960 --> 06:53.280
I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas

06:53.280 --> 06:54.720
because I feel like we're just getting hung up

06:54.720 --> 06:56.000
on terminology.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.160
Look, Adria, if you don't like the word trap,

06:58.160 --> 06:59.680
we just won't use the word trap.

06:59.680 --> 07:00.960
The real question is,

07:00.960 --> 07:03.280
is it gay to be attracted to trans women?

07:03.280 --> 07:04.320
It is if you're a woman.

07:04.320 --> 07:05.920
No, I mean for men.

07:05.920 --> 07:09.120
Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men or gay men?

07:09.120 --> 07:11.760
Well, all the men I've dated only date women,

07:11.760 --> 07:13.680
but if they're attracted to me,

07:14.800 --> 07:16.800
I mean, it's not the straightest thing, is it?

07:16.800 --> 07:17.440
Why not?

07:17.440 --> 07:20.000
You look like a woman and I know that you know

07:20.000 --> 07:22.240
that gay men are not attracted to these tits.

07:22.240 --> 07:24.560
Well, I am serving up fishy realness.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.000
So, granted.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.760
Well, doesn't she have a point, though, Adria?

07:27.760 --> 07:29.920
I mean, sure, she looks like a woman,

07:29.920 --> 07:32.480
but she does have XY chromosomes.

07:32.480 --> 07:34.000
When was the last time you were attracted

07:34.000 --> 07:35.680
to a person's chromosomes?

07:35.680 --> 07:37.520
That's not how sexuality works.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.840
We're attracted to a person's perceptible features,

07:39.840 --> 07:41.440
not molecular biology.

07:41.440 --> 07:43.280
Okay, sure, but I mean,

07:43.280 --> 07:45.360
a lot of trans women still have their penis,

07:45.360 --> 07:48.640
and you gotta admit, that seems kinda gay.

07:48.640 --> 07:51.280
Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you?

07:51.280 --> 07:53.440
We live in a world where there's no shortage of men

07:53.440 --> 07:54.720
who wanna date trans women.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.440
But there's an intense stigma on dating trans women,

07:57.440 --> 07:58.720
and it's actually dangerous,

07:58.720 --> 08:01.520
because what happens is if a man's friends find out

08:01.520 --> 08:03.120
that the woman he's dating is trans,

08:03.120 --> 08:06.000
he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity

08:06.000 --> 08:08.960
by lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating.

08:08.960 --> 08:10.640
And this happens again and again.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.600
And every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay,

08:13.600 --> 08:14.960
you're adding to that stigma,

08:14.960 --> 08:16.720
and you're making the world a more dangerous

08:16.720 --> 08:18.160
and violent place for trans women.

08:18.160 --> 08:21.200
All right, I'm not trying to use violent words or whatever.

08:21.200 --> 08:24.000
I just don't understand how a person who's attracted to women

08:24.000 --> 08:26.320
could be attracted to a person with a penis.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.400
Well, if you wanna know, I'll tell you.

08:28.400 --> 08:29.440
I am a lesbian.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.400
I'm only attracted to women, including trans women.

08:32.400 --> 08:34.240
And when I'm attracted to a trans woman,

08:34.240 --> 08:35.760
I perceive her as a woman.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.960
And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation,

08:38.960 --> 08:41.360
but as a part of her female body.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.800
So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick.

08:44.800 --> 08:46.160
I'm sorry, what?

08:46.160 --> 08:47.840
What is girl dick?

08:47.840 --> 08:49.040
The feminine penis.

08:49.040 --> 08:49.840
Oh no.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.800
Oh, come on.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.240
This is nonsense.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.840
How could a penis possibly be?

08:53.840 --> 08:54.640
Feminine.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.880
Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman,

08:56.880 --> 08:59.760
but also because hormones actually change the anatomy

08:59.760 --> 09:01.920
and functionality of the penis.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.680
Ugh, shut up, Adria.

09:03.680 --> 09:04.640
Just shut up.

09:04.640 --> 09:05.600
Wait, really?

09:05.600 --> 09:06.560
How is it different?

09:06.560 --> 09:07.920
Well, I'm glad you asked.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.240
More needs to be said about the feminine penis.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.040
Why is no one talking about the feminine penis?

09:13.040 --> 09:13.760
Kill me now.

09:13.760 --> 09:15.600
So to start with, it doesn't get as hard,

09:15.600 --> 09:17.120
it doesn't really ejaculate,

09:17.120 --> 09:19.280
and it has a different mouth feel.

09:19.280 --> 09:21.040
Can we please talk about the mouth feel?

09:21.040 --> 09:23.120
Why is no one talking about the mouth feel?

09:23.120 --> 09:25.760
I don't think that's necessary.

09:25.760 --> 09:27.920
I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.

09:27.920 --> 09:30.480
You are attracted to women with dicks,

09:31.200 --> 09:32.240
but not to men.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.280
That's correct.

09:33.280 --> 09:34.640
I don't like man dick.

09:34.640 --> 09:37.440
It's coarse and rough and irritating,

09:37.440 --> 09:39.120
and it comes everywhere.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.320
Not like girl dick.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.320
Girl dick is everything soft and smooth.

09:42.320 --> 09:43.680
Ugh, what is that?

09:43.680 --> 09:44.480
Star Wars?

09:44.480 --> 09:45.120
Ugh.

09:45.120 --> 09:47.280
Do you also build computers for a living?

09:47.280 --> 09:48.640
I mean, guilty.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.320
I also enjoy wearing knee socks.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.240
And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.360
My sweet love.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.760
Wait, you're dating that crazy Antifa cat?

09:59.760 --> 10:01.520
Well, we're in the same polycule.

10:01.520 --> 10:02.480
I don't know what that means,

10:02.480 --> 10:04.480
and I'm not, like, prejudiced or anything,

10:04.480 --> 10:08.240
but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.

10:08.240 --> 10:11.680
Like, if you're born male and you're attracted to women,

10:11.680 --> 10:13.760
how is it not just heterosexuality?

10:13.760 --> 10:16.240
Well, my girlfriend is also trans,

10:16.240 --> 10:19.120
so if you follow your logic to its conclusion...

10:19.680 --> 10:20.800
Okay, so.

10:21.760 --> 10:22.560
You're a woman.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.080
Who's born a man.

10:25.040 --> 10:26.480
And you like women.

10:27.120 --> 10:28.400
But you're dating a woman.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.640
A woman who has a penis.

10:30.640 --> 10:33.360
You are a female penis that used to be a male penis.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.480
And you're attracted to women.

10:36.480 --> 10:37.760
But you're born a man.

10:38.640 --> 10:40.240
And you're attracted to women.

10:40.240 --> 10:44.560
But the woman you're dating has a penis.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.400
So that means you are gay.

10:46.400 --> 10:50.240
But you're gay in the opposite way as the kind of gay that you were born as.

10:50.240 --> 10:52.160
I can go over it with you again after the show,

10:52.160 --> 10:52.960
if you need some extra time.

10:52.960 --> 10:56.960
Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals?

10:56.960 --> 10:59.280
Adria, just stop talking.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.120
Look, I don't care what you do in private,

11:01.120 --> 11:02.800
but I'm sorry to break it to you,

11:02.800 --> 11:05.760
the world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.

11:05.760 --> 11:09.280
What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile,

11:09.280 --> 11:11.760
and people like me to be our representatives.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.520
Because I act like a normal woman,

11:13.520 --> 11:14.960
and I date normal men,

11:14.960 --> 11:17.600
and I don't have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.100
Ugh.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.800
Also, I look fucking gorgeous.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.720
I'm sorry, but that matters.

11:22.720 --> 11:26.000
Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart.

11:26.000 --> 11:27.520
You're not Blair White.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.920
Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done,

11:29.920 --> 11:31.360
so that's not a fair comparison.

11:31.360 --> 11:32.640
What work are you having done?

11:32.640 --> 11:34.000
I'm gonna lower my hairline,

11:34.000 --> 11:35.680
shave some bone off my jaw,

11:35.680 --> 11:37.040
reshape my brow,

11:37.040 --> 11:38.400
get some lip injections,

11:38.400 --> 11:40.320
maybe botox my forehead.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.640
Oh, and I'm gonna fix my nose, obviously.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.320
What's wrong with your nose?

11:44.320 --> 11:46.000
It's kind of big and mannish.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.920
Well, my nose looks kind of like that.

11:47.920 --> 11:49.600
Are you saying I look mannish?

11:49.600 --> 11:51.200
Are you saying I look ugly?

11:51.200 --> 11:52.560
What are you trying to say, Tiffany?

11:52.720 --> 11:53.920
Why are you doing this to me?

11:53.920 --> 11:55.200
Why are you doing this to women?

11:56.080 --> 11:57.840
I'm not doing anything to women.

11:57.840 --> 11:58.480
What?

11:58.480 --> 12:00.960
Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.

12:01.840 --> 12:03.840
That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman.

12:03.840 --> 12:06.000
She has to work really hard to be seen as female,

12:06.000 --> 12:06.880
and you just don't.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.400
Shut the hell up, Adria.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.920
Don't get offended for me.

12:09.920 --> 12:11.440
Don't condescend to me.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.400
I'm not a victim.

12:13.280 --> 12:15.520
Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be,

12:16.080 --> 12:19.200
but my fiancé still thinks I'm beautiful.

12:19.200 --> 12:20.160
Oh my god.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.840
I need to not be around straight people

12:21.840 --> 12:22.640
for a long time.

12:22.720 --> 12:23.360
I'm after this.

12:26.960 --> 12:28.560
All right, let's forget about it.

12:28.560 --> 12:31.360
I'm fine.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.600
Tiffany, are you fine?

12:33.600 --> 12:34.640
I am fine.

12:34.640 --> 12:36.880
To be clear, I'm not fine with any of this.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.880
Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out?

12:38.880 --> 12:41.280
Let's shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post.

12:42.640 --> 12:45.680
Well, we may never know whether traps are gay,

12:45.680 --> 12:48.560
but the important thing is that we talked about it.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.640
I'm Jackie Jackson for The Freedom Report,

12:50.640 --> 12:52.400
where the debate never stops.

12:52.960 --> 12:54.800
Your mascara is running.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.920
Get out of my studio.

12:55.920 --> 12:56.800
Both of you.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.060
Get out.

12:59.840 --> 13:00.400
We're done.

13:08.800 --> 13:09.680
Hi, Nick.

13:09.680 --> 13:10.560
Yeah, I'm finished.

13:11.680 --> 13:12.960
Well, it was a shit show.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.320
No, Adria was fine.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.000
She was cringe as fuck the whole time.

13:18.000 --> 13:18.880
Let's have her back.

13:19.440 --> 13:20.640
Tiffany was the problem.

13:20.640 --> 13:22.560
She kept veering off message.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.000
And she got emotional.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.280
Yeah, don't invite her back.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.400
Get Blair next time.

13:32.160 --> 13:32.960
And the week after.

13:33.520 --> 13:34.640
Can we get Kanye West?

13:34.640 --> 13:35.520
We can't get Kanye.

13:36.720 --> 13:37.680
Get Candace Owens.

13:38.400 --> 13:40.400
Oh, and what have you done to my studio?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.440
Hey, Adria, look.

13:44.160 --> 13:46.960
I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay?

13:46.960 --> 13:48.960
It's just that I've been working so hard

13:48.960 --> 13:50.720
to win acceptance for trans people,

13:50.720 --> 13:51.920
to show everyone that we're normal,

13:51.920 --> 13:53.520
that we're just like them.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.520
And when you show up looking like that

13:57.520 --> 13:58.960
and acting like that,

13:58.960 --> 14:00.560
it's just hard for me to watch

14:00.560 --> 14:02.560
all my hard work be undone, you know?

14:02.560 --> 14:04.400
Like, you can't be talking about

14:04.400 --> 14:07.440
the feminine penis in front of cis people.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.920
Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now

14:09.920 --> 14:11.600
for your own physical safety.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.200
Oh my god, you crazy freak.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.840
Donald Trump is right over here here,

14:23.840 --> 14:25.400
500了我也

14:25.400 --> 14:27.600
I said I can't make you guys cry

14:27.600 --> 14:41.760
If you battery out,

14:41.760 --> 14:43.840
you're getting out of here.

14:43.840 --> 14:44.960
You're getting old.

14:44.960 --> 14:45.600
I am.

14:45.600 --> 14:46.080
I got Aquí,

14:46.080 --> 14:46.240
and she sticks out

14:46.240 --> 14:47.360
like a bee

14:47.360 --> 14:48.320
You are not, black and white.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.920
I got people who see me because I'm Pinocchio.

14:49.920 --> 14:50.960
Don't blame ourselves for that.

14:50.960 --> 14:51.760
We don't do that every day.

14:51.760 --> 14:56.400
I hate Adria. She looks like a man-beast.

14:56.400 --> 15:00.800
Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.

15:00.800 --> 15:04.880
Ah, this hun. People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what

15:04.880 --> 15:07.840
trans people are.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.520
You should not be representing us. They're nothing like me. I'm nothing like them.

15:11.520 --> 15:17.040
I need you to relax.

15:21.760 --> 15:33.200
No, I want to act a punk toward the acceptance of the truth.

15:33.200 --> 15:37.680
Well, it sucked. You're gonna do that by identifying as a trap.

15:37.680 --> 15:43.120
I look good, but Adria's fucking everything up.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.400
All right, what are they saying?

15:47.760 --> 15:50.160
Fuck it.

15:51.760 --> 16:07.040
Okay, so I don't pass perfectly.

16:07.040 --> 16:10.640
But at least I know that. I may have a mental illness, but I'm

16:10.640 --> 16:13.920
I'm self-aware about it. I'm not delusional.

16:13.920 --> 16:18.800
I'm not like Adria. I'm nothing like her.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.600
You know, it's fine. It's gonna be fine.

16:22.160 --> 16:24.880
I'm gonna have the work done. I can fix this.

16:25.920 --> 16:29.920
It's my fault for not working harder. You can't just expect society to...

16:31.600 --> 16:32.480
I'm not a victim.

16:34.560 --> 16:38.240
I am in control of my life.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.360
I wish I were a woman.

16:47.680 --> 16:49.360
Or anything but this.

16:51.600 --> 16:57.600
I'm destroying my body.

16:57.600 --> 17:03.600
Who could ever love this?

17:03.600 --> 17:09.600
I'm just mutilating myself.

17:09.600 --> 17:13.600
It's so disgusting.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.600
God, I'm so disgusting.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.600
It's so disgusting.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.600
It's so disgusting. God, I'm so disgusting.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.600
It's so disgusting.

17:31.600 --> 17:35.600
I'm just using another drink.

17:36.960 --> 17:39.920
I am not a victim.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.920
I'm in complete control.

17:41.920 --> 17:43.920
I am not a victim.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.920
I am in complete control.

17:51.600 --> 18:21.580
I don't know.

18:21.600 --> 18:51.580
I don't know.

18:51.600 --> 19:21.580
I don't know.

19:21.600 --> 19:35.120
Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tobles.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.760
Welcome to my world.

19:51.600 --> 20:21.580
Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tobles.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.480
And it's you, dear, head in the sand.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.960
It's not really ignorance of mine.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.740
It's the willful bigot's fight.

20:31.260 --> 20:49.500
There is one thing that I cannot stand.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.580
And it's you, dear, head in the sand.

20:51.600 --> 20:52.300
And it's you, dear, head in the sand.

20:53.060 --> 20:56.640
And it's not really ignorance of mine.

20:56.920 --> 20:59.500
It's just the willful bigot's fight.

21:01.280 --> 21:03.740
Don't let them define us.
