WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:19.640
Hello, my devilish darlings! It is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I'm here

00:19.640 --> 00:25.640
to warn you that some viewers may find tonight's program disturbing. There will be discussion

00:25.640 --> 00:31.580
of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime. Ugh. So if that's gonna

00:31.580 --> 00:38.800
make you sad, please don't watch this. Unless you enjoy sadness. I know I do. But your macabre

00:38.800 --> 00:44.500
mother wants you to take care of yourself, so here, I made you a wet pot of hot tea and

00:44.500 --> 00:49.240
you can take it out on the balcony and pour it on some pedestrians. That always cheers

00:49.240 --> 00:51.240
me up!

00:51.240 --> 00:54.440
1. Traps

00:54.440 --> 01:03.400
Gentlemen of the Academy, it is my duty to submit to you the findings of my latest memetic

01:03.400 --> 01:09.980
research. Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe, scrutinizing

01:09.980 --> 01:17.720
volumes ancient and modern, in search of the answer to two fundamental questions. What

01:17.720 --> 01:21.500
are traps? And be they gay?

01:21.500 --> 01:24.420
With respect to the former inquiry, I adjure you that you will not be able to find any

01:24.420 --> 01:25.420
answer to these questions.

01:25.420 --> 01:31.660
2. A treatise by the lady scholar known as the pedantic Romantic, wherein the derivation

01:31.660 --> 01:36.660
of the word trap is traced to patrons of animated pictures from the Orient.

01:36.660 --> 01:37.660
Curious.

01:37.660 --> 01:43.180
The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century, when devotees of picture

01:43.180 --> 01:48.660
forums would proclaim the idiom, it's a trap, alongside the likeness of one Admiral

01:48.660 --> 01:53.380
Akbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place.

01:53.380 --> 01:54.380
3. Contemporaneous.

01:54.380 --> 02:00.120
The most notorious to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic Japonesques,

02:00.120 --> 02:05.720
to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined. The implication being

02:05.720 --> 02:10.740
that the subject of the portrait was not in sooth a daughter of Eve, but rather that the

02:10.740 --> 02:16.180
spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite skullduggery.

02:16.180 --> 02:22.500
Furthermore, it appears that from the first, the designation trap has signified not only

02:22.500 --> 02:24.220
transvestites, but transeptites.

02:24.220 --> 02:31.240
And this must needs be remarked, for it is evident such persons ofttimes inflame the

02:31.240 --> 02:33.000
lust of ordinary men.

02:33.000 --> 02:39.300
It is hence with respect to this phenomenon I pose my second question thus. Fellas, is

02:39.300 --> 02:40.300
it gay?

02:40.300 --> 02:44.180
I'm sorry, who are you talking to?

02:44.180 --> 02:51.220
Gentlemen of the Academy, did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again? It must needs be

02:51.220 --> 02:52.220
remarked.

02:52.220 --> 02:53.220
Please stop breaking into my room.

02:53.220 --> 02:54.220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.120
You don't want to enter my house?

02:56.120 --> 02:57.560
I shall be the queen of dairy.

02:57.560 --> 03:03.240
I'm sure you will be.

03:03.240 --> 03:04.340
Cross dresser!

03:04.340 --> 03:05.340
Hi!

03:05.340 --> 03:06.340
I'm Natalie Wynn.

03:06.340 --> 03:08.060
Biological woman.

03:08.060 --> 03:11.080
Can't we pan the camera down?

03:11.080 --> 03:14.700
My hair is less high?

03:16.040 --> 03:17.300
Are traps gay?

03:17.300 --> 03:19.100
The meme that will not die.

03:19.100 --> 03:24.180
Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male crossdresser

03:24.220 --> 03:26.720
or a trans woman, especially in a context

03:26.720 --> 03:28.680
of neotenous kawaii decadence.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.020
The meme, are traps gay, is a mostly jokey debate

03:32.020 --> 03:34.580
about the sexuality of men attracted to dick girls,

03:34.580 --> 03:36.280
futanari, MTFs.

03:36.280 --> 03:38.500
You know, a lot of these men don't know or care

03:38.500 --> 03:40.000
about the difference between a trans woman

03:40.000 --> 03:42.460
and a crossdresser, so it's kind of pointless

03:42.460 --> 03:43.600
to get hung up on that.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.900
The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago

03:45.900 --> 03:47.660
when someone released the worst specimens

03:47.660 --> 03:49.840
of the white race into the wild.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.420
All traps gay.

03:51.420 --> 03:53.280
One of life's most important questions.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.040
Are traps gay?

03:55.040 --> 03:59.600
Traps are gay, yes.

03:59.600 --> 04:03.140
Will there be transsexuals in the ethnic state?

04:04.940 --> 04:05.980
Hopefully not.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.680
To the men who meme about this topic,

04:07.680 --> 04:09.160
it's all lighthearted fun.

04:09.160 --> 04:10.940
It's part of a wider game they like to play

04:10.940 --> 04:12.040
called Is It Gay?

04:12.040 --> 04:14.620
You know, is it gay to have an MMF threesome

04:14.620 --> 04:16.180
only if the balls touch?

04:16.180 --> 04:17.460
Don't cross the streams.

04:17.460 --> 04:18.760
And so on.

04:18.760 --> 04:21.780
But to many trans women, the meme and the word trap itself

04:21.780 --> 04:22.940
are highly offensive.

04:22.940 --> 04:24.900
In fact, last year when I first proposed

04:24.900 --> 04:26.600
making a video about this topic,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.680
many trans people on Twitter were outraged

04:28.680 --> 04:30.080
because they felt that this topic

04:30.080 --> 04:32.260
is just too harmful to even discuss.

04:32.260 --> 04:34.620
So here's the challenge I face making this video.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.700
On the one hand, there's people who are gonna be upset

04:36.700 --> 04:39.480
and offended that I'm making a video about this topic at all.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.380
And on the other hand, there are people who think

04:41.380 --> 04:43.660
this is all just harmless otaku shit posting

04:43.660 --> 04:45.840
and who are gonna be annoyed by my trigger warnings.

04:45.840 --> 04:48.200
But first, to the people who think it's too offensive,

04:48.200 --> 04:49.800
here's what I have to say for myself.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.400
I've always believed that if you wanna persuade anyone,

04:52.400 --> 04:54.040
it helps to meet them where they're at.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.580
And in this case, rtrapsgay is where people are at.

04:57.580 --> 04:58.740
At one of my YouTube meetups,

04:58.740 --> 05:00.380
I met a high school teacher who told me

05:00.380 --> 05:02.420
that he overheard some of his male students

05:02.420 --> 05:04.740
joking in the hallway about rtrapsgay.

05:04.740 --> 05:07.780
When those teenage boys go home and Google rtrapsgay,

05:07.780 --> 05:09.380
who do you wanna explain it to them?

05:09.380 --> 05:12.440
Your choices are Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy,

05:12.440 --> 05:15.480
a Scottish hate crime convict named Count Dankula,

05:15.480 --> 05:16.640
or this tran.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.620
And at the risk of sounding arrogant,

05:18.620 --> 05:20.220
I think it should be me.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.200
You know, as trans women, we have little influence,

05:22.200 --> 05:23.140
in society.

05:23.140 --> 05:24.860
The people who lead the conversations about us

05:24.860 --> 05:26.700
are bigger and stronger than we are,

05:26.700 --> 05:29.200
so we're like a jogger racing against a car.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.920
The only way to win is to hijack the car.

05:31.920 --> 05:36.140
And so, this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation

05:36.140 --> 05:38.580
that straight men are having about us.

05:38.580 --> 05:41.960
As always, my aspiration is to derive a woke conclusion

05:41.960 --> 05:43.200
from edgy premises,

05:43.200 --> 05:45.740
to shitpost my way to the moral high ground.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.700
Now, straight men, isn't all this offense taking

05:48.700 --> 05:50.440
just more politically correct cuckoldry

05:50.440 --> 05:52.200
designed to take away your free speech?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.780
Well, I assure you, there will be no taking

05:54.780 --> 05:56.300
of your free speech on this channel,

05:56.300 --> 05:58.440
unless you clock my makeup, dickbag.

05:58.440 --> 05:59.880
Comment deleted.

05:59.880 --> 06:02.560
But, if you wanna know why trans women are offended

06:02.560 --> 06:05.140
by Are Traps Gay?, I'm happy to tell you.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.480
Not to silence you, of course,

06:06.480 --> 06:09.760
but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity

06:09.760 --> 06:12.800
to wanna know why someone different from you

06:12.800 --> 06:15.560
might be hurt by something that seems harmless to you.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.360
So, well, let's put it this way.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.840
Two, trans panic.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.360
The 1990 documentary, Paris is Burning,

06:25.360 --> 06:27.860
depicts the ball culture of black and Latinx

06:27.860 --> 06:29.980
gay and transgender people in New York City

06:29.980 --> 06:31.480
in the late 1980s.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.780
One of the main storylines follows a trans woman

06:33.780 --> 06:35.600
named Venus Extravaganza,

06:35.600 --> 06:38.920
who describes her precarious existence as a sex worker.

06:38.920 --> 06:42.380
I was with a guy, and he was playing with my titties

06:42.380 --> 06:44.440
till he touched me down there.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.480
He felt it, and he seen it, and he like totally flipped out.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.420
He said, you fucking faggot.

06:49.420 --> 06:50.460
You're a freak.

06:50.460 --> 06:51.880
You're a victim of AIDS,

06:51.880 --> 06:53.200
and you're trying to give me AIDS.

06:53.200 --> 06:54.060
What are you, crazy?

06:54.060 --> 06:54.900
You're a homo.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.000
I should kill you.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.520
And like, I was really terrified,

06:59.520 --> 07:01.560
so I just jumped out the window.

07:01.560 --> 07:03.440
During the filming of Paris is Burning,

07:03.440 --> 07:06.380
Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client.

07:06.380 --> 07:09.320
Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed.

07:09.320 --> 07:10.780
Trans women, in my country,

07:10.780 --> 07:12.880
almost entirely trans women of color,

07:12.880 --> 07:15.120
are murdered at a disgracefully high rate,

07:15.120 --> 07:17.960
reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017.

07:17.960 --> 07:20.180
The men who murder trans women often claim

07:20.180 --> 07:21.640
they were provoked to violence

07:21.880 --> 07:24.020
by alleged deception of their victims.

07:24.020 --> 07:26.540
This is what's called the trans panic defense

07:26.540 --> 07:27.980
when legally invoked,

07:27.980 --> 07:30.460
as in the 2004 trial of the killers

07:30.460 --> 07:32.960
of the teenage trans girl, Gwen Araujo.

07:32.960 --> 07:34.820
One of the killers, who had sex with Gwen

07:34.820 --> 07:36.220
before learning she was trans,

07:36.220 --> 07:38.360
cried, I can't be fucking gay,

07:38.360 --> 07:39.920
before beating her to death.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.440
Men are often willing to side with these killers,

07:42.440 --> 07:45.000
saying that if trans women don't want to get murdered,

07:45.000 --> 07:46.960
then they shouldn't trick men.

07:46.960 --> 07:48.220
But what you have to understand is,

07:48.220 --> 07:51.060
first, men usually do know when they're having sex

07:51.060 --> 07:51.900
with a trans woman.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.280
Like, if you have a dick,

07:53.280 --> 07:56.040
it's pretty hard, actually, to have sex with someone

07:56.040 --> 07:57.540
and have them not notice it.

07:57.540 --> 08:01.260
And second, a lot of men view trans women's entire existence

08:01.260 --> 08:03.240
as itself a kind of trickery.

08:03.240 --> 08:05.240
A black trans woman named Elan Nettles

08:05.240 --> 08:07.140
was murdered in Harlem in 2013

08:07.140 --> 08:10.300
by a man whose friends had mocked him for flirting with her.

08:10.300 --> 08:12.060
All she did to provoke him

08:12.060 --> 08:14.640
was walk down the street with two friends.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.940
The common thread here is not deception

08:16.940 --> 08:18.300
on the part of the victims,

08:18.300 --> 08:20.960
but rather the drive of the killers to protect

08:20.960 --> 08:23.640
their social standing as masculine and straight.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.720
But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure

08:26.720 --> 08:29.500
is something that many trans women across class and race

08:29.500 --> 08:31.160
experience some version of,

08:31.160 --> 08:36.000
because men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement,

08:36.000 --> 08:39.920
as the orchidaceous invitation to a proboscis.

08:39.920 --> 08:42.200
I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman

08:42.200 --> 08:44.760
who was attacked recently by a man at a bar

08:44.760 --> 08:46.060
who started flirting with her

08:46.060 --> 08:49.000
until he realized she was trans and then punched her.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.060
Like, what was she supposed to do

08:50.060 --> 08:50.940
to stop that from happening?

08:50.940 --> 08:52.380
Just stay at home?

08:52.380 --> 08:55.420
For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us

08:55.420 --> 08:57.620
for existing actually limit our freedom.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.100
There's bars I won't go into

08:59.100 --> 09:02.100
because I don't trust the clientele to side with me

09:02.100 --> 09:04.160
if some shit like that goes down.

09:04.160 --> 09:05.620
And I've had little scares.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.120
I was in the back of an Uber once

09:07.120 --> 09:09.540
and the driver comes on a little flirty, you know,

09:09.540 --> 09:10.560
what's your name?

09:10.560 --> 09:11.560
Are you a student?

09:11.560 --> 09:12.980
And I'm thinking, wow,

09:12.980 --> 09:15.420
he thinks I'm young enough to be a student.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.220
But at some point he goes silent

09:17.220 --> 09:19.940
and suddenly I'm getting a very icy glare

09:19.940 --> 09:20.660
in the rear view mirror.

09:20.660 --> 09:22.660
Like, fucking clocked.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.580
And for a second I'm like, fuck,

09:24.580 --> 09:26.660
I'm gonna die in the back of this car.

09:26.660 --> 09:27.940
And of course I didn't die.

09:27.940 --> 09:31.200
The rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.860
I mean, I'm gonna be fine

09:32.860 --> 09:34.780
because white middle-class transsexuals

09:34.780 --> 09:36.220
don't get murdered in this country.

09:36.220 --> 09:38.860
The murder issue exists at a specific intersection

09:38.860 --> 09:40.400
of gender, class, and race.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.520
And it's really not my oppression to claim.

09:42.520 --> 09:44.840
You know, I sometimes hear white, bougie, middle-class,

09:44.840 --> 09:46.880
computer programmer trans women be like,

09:46.880 --> 09:49.380
we're getting murdered in the streets.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.300
Who's we?

09:50.300 --> 09:52.340
It's not white middle-class trans women.

09:52.340 --> 09:55.400
So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane.

09:55.400 --> 09:58.360
It exists at this intersection of masculinity and race.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.000
And it's really not a conversation

10:00.000 --> 10:01.600
that should be led by a white woman,

10:01.600 --> 10:04.960
especially when there's so, so, so many things

10:04.960 --> 10:07.200
to critique about white masculinity.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.540
Let's talk about some now.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.020
Three, taking offense.

10:12.020 --> 10:13.980
Okay, back to traps.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.800
Now this is my lane.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.900
I'm not sure anything's ever been more my lane.

10:17.900 --> 10:20.100
Ah, the exquisite pleasure of being

10:20.300 --> 10:22.320
entitled to the soapbox.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.540
So boys, I've showed you how trans women's freedom

10:25.540 --> 10:28.320
is abridged by our need to navigate around men

10:28.320 --> 10:29.820
who view our gender presentation,

10:29.820 --> 10:33.440
in fact, our very existence, as a kind of trap.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.440
I think it should therefore be pretty clear

10:35.440 --> 10:37.740
why trans women are not the biggest fans

10:37.740 --> 10:39.140
of you using that word for us,

10:39.140 --> 10:41.740
or for Fudanari, or cross-dressers, or whatever.

10:41.740 --> 10:44.360
I mean, to be honest, if someone calls me a trap,

10:44.360 --> 10:46.380
my response is more like, wow,

10:46.380 --> 10:48.740
a transphobe thought I looked like a woman.

10:48.740 --> 10:50.240
But that's because I'm so pathetic,

10:50.240 --> 10:52.260
I have to go dumpster diving for validation.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.100
But the rest of the trans women out there,

10:54.100 --> 10:56.360
the ones with dignity and self-respect,

10:56.360 --> 10:58.340
you should definitely not call them traps.

10:58.340 --> 11:00.460
Of course, some trans women will overstate the case

11:00.460 --> 11:03.140
and say the word trap is literally getting trans women killed,

11:03.140 --> 11:06.180
which, I can't find any examples of the word trap

11:06.180 --> 11:07.720
being connected to a murder,

11:07.720 --> 11:11.540
but why don't we stop using the word before someone dies?

11:11.540 --> 11:14.160
Because what you're doing when you call trans women traps

11:14.160 --> 11:15.760
is you're showing that you think of us

11:15.760 --> 11:17.180
the exact same way as the men

11:17.180 --> 11:19.140
who try to justify attacking us.

11:19.140 --> 11:20.960
When a man kills a trans woman,

11:20.960 --> 11:23.240
literally the argument he trots out in court

11:23.240 --> 11:24.540
is that he was trapped.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.360
And that's what you're reminding us of

11:26.360 --> 11:27.900
when you use that word.

11:27.900 --> 11:30.340
And that's why trans women are getting triggered over it.

11:30.340 --> 11:32.200
You know, sometimes people have good reasons

11:32.200 --> 11:33.600
for being triggered by things,

11:33.600 --> 11:35.640
and this is one of those times.

11:35.640 --> 11:38.300
So, if I were a different kind of creator,

11:38.300 --> 11:39.780
I could really end this video now.

11:39.780 --> 11:41.860
I think I've made a pretty convincing case

11:41.860 --> 11:45.120
that trans women are justifiably offended by the word trap.

11:45.120 --> 11:48.020
But if I leave it at that, and this is for you, Twitter,

11:48.020 --> 11:50.080
this is why I'm making this video.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.300
If I simply argue that are traps gay is offensive,

11:53.300 --> 11:54.600
then here's what happens.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.260
First, a lot of people simply don't give a shit.

11:57.260 --> 11:58.800
In fact, me telling them it's offensive

11:58.800 --> 12:00.460
only makes them wanna say it more,

12:00.460 --> 12:02.100
because they feel on a deep level

12:02.100 --> 12:04.700
that they are by nature superior to trans people.

12:04.700 --> 12:06.960
So an uppity telling them what words

12:06.960 --> 12:09.320
they're allowed to say completely enrages them.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.460
So they'll comment, traps are gay, lol,

12:11.460 --> 12:13.780
just to reaffirm their superiority over me

12:13.780 --> 12:16.100
and that I have no power or influence over them.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.020
And there's really nothing I can do about those,

12:18.020 --> 12:18.860
trans people.

12:18.860 --> 12:20.980
But another group of people,

12:20.980 --> 12:22.960
the socially progressive liberals,

12:22.960 --> 12:25.860
they'll say, okay, so since you're offended by it,

12:25.860 --> 12:27.520
I won't say the word trap anymore.

12:27.520 --> 12:29.040
And they'll be super woke about it,

12:29.040 --> 12:30.380
and they'll post Twitter call-outs

12:30.380 --> 12:32.420
canceling anyone who uses the word trap,

12:32.420 --> 12:34.820
and they'll be very respectful and compassionate

12:34.820 --> 12:36.640
toward trans people in public,

12:36.640 --> 12:38.960
so long as it makes them look good

12:38.960 --> 12:42.020
to indulge and pity this tragic third-world country

12:42.020 --> 12:43.060
of a gender minority.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.360
But then they'll go home at night,

12:45.360 --> 12:48.020
and in that twilight between consciousness and sleep,

12:48.020 --> 12:51.980
their inner voice will whisper, but are traps gay?

12:51.980 --> 12:53.580
And then, years later,

12:53.580 --> 12:56.240
when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend,

12:56.240 --> 12:59.140
we'll suddenly watch all that shallow wokeness vanish

12:59.140 --> 13:01.280
like so much politically correct vapor.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.200
Real acceptance has to be built on real understanding.

13:05.200 --> 13:06.880
So it's not enough for me to argue

13:06.880 --> 13:09.400
that are traps gay is offensive.

13:09.400 --> 13:14.400
I also have to argue whether traps are gay.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.860
So are traps gay?

13:16.860 --> 13:17.860
Let's watch this.

13:17.860 --> 13:20.220
Watch an instructional video to learn more.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.840
Four, the philosopher.

13:39.760 --> 13:41.020
Hello, boys.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.960
It is I, the half-queen, points.

13:43.960 --> 13:46.000
After 30 days and 30 nights,

13:46.000 --> 13:47.860
the philosopher descended from the mountain

13:47.860 --> 13:50.860
on top and to the gathered villagers thus spake.

13:50.860 --> 13:53.460
Are traps gay, said he,

13:53.460 --> 13:56.400
to whom the half-queen thus replied.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.960
Hmm, let's see.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.320
Let me think about it.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.160
Oh.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.040
I'm gonna stop saying trap now

14:04.040 --> 14:06.640
because it's not a good word, as has been explained.

14:06.640 --> 14:08.440
In fact, it's really best to treat it like a slur.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.960
So what we're really asking here is if a man is attracted to

14:11.960 --> 14:14.620
or has sex with a trans woman, is that gay?

14:14.620 --> 14:17.800
Well, the simple answer is no, because trans women are,

14:17.800 --> 14:21.200
and a man having sex with a woman is,

14:22.300 --> 14:25.600
let's see here, according to the experts I've consulted,

14:25.600 --> 14:27.140
it is not in fact gay.

14:27.140 --> 14:28.800
But that's not the most persuasive answer

14:28.800 --> 14:30.720
because in order to find it convincing,

14:30.720 --> 14:33.600
you already have to believe that trans women are women.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.520
And unfortunately, if you ask the average person about this,

14:36.520 --> 14:38.040
what they say is something like,

14:38.040 --> 14:40.740
sure, I think trans women are women,

14:40.740 --> 14:44.680
but they shouldn't expect men to wanna date them

14:44.680 --> 14:47.020
unless they're into that sort of thing.

14:47.020 --> 14:51.560
Oh, and what sort of thing is that?

14:51.560 --> 14:53.780
Usually when a man tells you he's dating a woman

14:53.780 --> 14:55.240
and you say, oh, what's she like?

14:55.240 --> 14:57.280
And he says, she's from Cincinnati,

14:57.280 --> 15:00.640
your response is not, oh, David,

15:00.640 --> 15:04.420
I didn't realize you were into that sort of thing.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.360
In other words, these people tell you trans women are women,

15:07.360 --> 15:10.220
but, and then they say something that shows

15:10.220 --> 15:13.480
they don't really think trans women are women at all.

15:13.480 --> 15:16.740
So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point,

15:16.740 --> 15:19.640
it would basically be circular reasoning for me

15:19.640 --> 15:22.560
to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn't gay

15:22.560 --> 15:24.500
because trans women are women,

15:24.500 --> 15:26.240
since the womanhood of trans women

15:26.240 --> 15:28.800
is precisely the point that's being disputed.

15:28.800 --> 15:31.160
So maybe the observational approach is better.

15:31.160 --> 15:33.100
The facts are indisputable.

15:33.100 --> 15:35.920
Many heterosexual men are attracted to trans women

15:35.920 --> 15:37.940
and comparatively few gay men are.

15:37.940 --> 15:40.680
Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact

15:40.680 --> 15:42.700
about our everyday experience in the world.

15:42.700 --> 15:45.600
We know who's attracted to us and who isn't.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.420
So to us,

15:46.740 --> 15:49.580
this completely unnecessary debate is as impractical

15:49.580 --> 15:52.400
as the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.160
Sure, philosophers can say,

15:54.160 --> 15:57.100
but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow?

15:57.100 --> 16:00.020
To which the correct response is shut the fuck up, nerd.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.080
Stop playing 3D chess against your own brain

16:02.080 --> 16:03.840
and find a real thing to worry about.

16:03.840 --> 16:05.560
It's just a basic fact of experience

16:05.560 --> 16:07.000
that the sun rises every morning.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.920
And to trans women, it's a basic fact of experience

16:09.920 --> 16:11.680
that the people who are attracted to us

16:11.680 --> 16:13.900
are people who are attracted to women.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.160
Of the cis men I've been with

16:15.160 --> 16:16.740
since I started my transition,

16:16.740 --> 16:18.400
all identify as straight

16:18.400 --> 16:20.360
and all had only ever been with cis women

16:20.360 --> 16:22.280
until this trend came along.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.400
Am I really so powerful as a seductress

16:24.400 --> 16:26.760
that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay

16:26.760 --> 16:28.340
over these tiny tits?

16:28.340 --> 16:30.520
Let's not get cocky.

16:31.520 --> 16:34.420
I mean, if a man is attracted to women and not to men

16:34.420 --> 16:35.900
and he perceives me as a woman

16:35.900 --> 16:37.620
and is attracted to me as a woman

16:37.620 --> 16:38.780
and he sleeps with me

16:38.780 --> 16:41.000
and then he continues being attracted to women

16:41.000 --> 16:42.240
and not to men,

16:42.240 --> 16:44.680
in what world is that anything but a straight man?

16:44.680 --> 16:46.580
What wild maze of reasoning do you have

16:46.580 --> 16:48.900
to invent to argue that this man is really gay?

16:48.900 --> 16:51.580
Well, we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes,

16:51.580 --> 16:53.000
beginning with the obvious.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.340
What about the penis?

16:55.340 --> 16:57.480
Ah, yes, the penis.

16:57.480 --> 16:58.920
Look, baby, we'll get to the penis.

16:58.920 --> 17:00.300
Don't you worry about that.

17:00.300 --> 17:02.000
But first, I should remind everyone

17:02.000 --> 17:05.140
that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas

17:05.140 --> 17:06.760
because they got five.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.600
The surgery.

17:10.340 --> 17:11.800
In fact, I've been thinking of signing up

17:11.800 --> 17:13.120
for a vagina myself,

17:13.120 --> 17:15.860
but the thing is I make too much money for Medicaid now,

17:15.860 --> 17:17.680
so I have to form an LLC,

17:17.680 --> 17:20.780
become my own employer so I can give myself health benefits,

17:20.780 --> 17:22.620
and ugh, it's so much paperwork.

17:22.620 --> 17:24.720
You have to become an unincorporated legal entity

17:24.720 --> 17:26.640
in this country just to get a .

17:26.640 --> 17:28.660
Of course, transphobic radical feminists will say

17:28.660 --> 17:30.920
it's not a real vagina, just a fuckhole,

17:30.920 --> 17:33.880
because a real vagina is a sacred passage.

17:33.880 --> 17:35.080
And that's fine by me.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.240
What am I gonna do with a sacred passage anyway?

17:37.240 --> 17:38.680
Get fingered by the Pope?

17:38.680 --> 17:39.520
Pass.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.300
Straight men don't get hung up on this.

17:41.300 --> 17:43.620
I guarantee you no straight man has ever thought

17:43.620 --> 17:45.240
of a vagina as a sacred passage.

17:45.240 --> 17:46.900
They're either grossed out by it

17:46.900 --> 17:48.320
or they're trying to climb inside.

17:48.320 --> 17:50.000
What I'm trying to say is in the past,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.360
I've been a little uncertain about getting a vagina

17:52.360 --> 17:54.520
because my genital dysphoria isn't that bad.

17:54.520 --> 17:57.640
And besides, chicks with dicks are very in right now,

17:57.640 --> 17:59.360
very 2019, very trending.

17:59.360 --> 18:00.600
And being a dick girl,

18:00.600 --> 18:03.000
it's kind of like being a legendary Pokemon, you know?

18:03.000 --> 18:05.440
People take interest, people pay attention to you,

18:05.440 --> 18:06.940
and isn't that what we all want?

18:06.940 --> 18:08.280
But unfashionable though it is,

18:08.280 --> 18:11.020
I do think I want the surgery because,

18:11.020 --> 18:14.260
well, guys, can I confess something kind of dark to you?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.140
I have this really, really, really, really, really,

18:15.140 --> 18:17.280
really fucked up fetish

18:17.280 --> 18:21.080
where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.200
Crazy, right?

18:22.200 --> 18:23.160
I mean, I like anal,

18:23.160 --> 18:25.780
but the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well.

18:25.780 --> 18:27.200
Ew, I don't want to eat well.

18:27.200 --> 18:29.560
I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get dicked.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.740
Is that a crime?

18:30.740 --> 18:32.120
It is kind of a scary surgery though.

18:32.120 --> 18:33.720
Like what if my vagina sucks?

18:33.720 --> 18:35.440
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

18:35.440 --> 18:37.360
The tests are back and are showing that

18:37.360 --> 18:41.440
in the medical terminology, your vagina does indeed suck.

18:41.440 --> 18:44.740
The point is the easy sell version of the argument I'm making

18:44.740 --> 18:47.180
is that there's nothing homosexual about a man's attraction

18:47.180 --> 18:49.860
to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years.

18:49.860 --> 18:52.400
She has female skin, she smells like a woman,

18:52.400 --> 18:55.140
she has breasts, she's giving hair, body, face,

18:55.140 --> 18:56.980
she's post-op and has a vagina.

18:56.980 --> 18:59.140
Now even in this situation, people will still say

18:59.140 --> 19:00.960
it's gay because of the chromosomes.

19:00.960 --> 19:03.500
But look, human beings have five senses

19:03.500 --> 19:05.740
and none of them can detect chromosomes.

19:05.740 --> 19:07.320
Sexual attraction is not based

19:07.320 --> 19:09.440
on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender.

19:09.440 --> 19:10.920
It's based on perception.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.620
And if you're a man and you perceive someone as a woman

19:13.620 --> 19:14.680
and you're attracted to her

19:14.680 --> 19:17.580
as a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment,

19:17.580 --> 19:18.420
my dude.

19:18.420 --> 19:19.900
Congratulations, you're a breeder.

19:19.900 --> 19:22.420
Now the argument people make is, okay, fine.

19:22.420 --> 19:25.600
It's straight if you mistake her for a biological woman.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.940
But if you know she's a man and you're still attracted,

19:27.940 --> 19:30.520
then it's gay.

19:30.520 --> 19:33.040
So look, if you believe that trans women are men,

19:33.040 --> 19:35.740
then that belief might interfere with your perceptions

19:35.740 --> 19:37.380
and it might change the relationship

19:37.380 --> 19:39.740
between your perceptions and your sexual response.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.680
But more likely is that you still will feel attraction

19:42.680 --> 19:43.800
to the trans woman.

19:43.800 --> 19:46.560
Only if you value your identity as a straight man,

19:46.560 --> 19:48.480
you'll feel ashamed of your attraction

19:48.480 --> 19:50.040
and you'll try to fight and deny it.

19:50.040 --> 19:52.040
And you'll probably end up treating trans women

19:52.040 --> 19:53.520
like absolute garbage.

19:53.520 --> 19:56.900
Now, if I wanted to make the SJW 101 type response here,

19:56.900 --> 19:58.940
I would say trans women are women

19:58.940 --> 20:00.780
because they identify as women.

20:00.780 --> 20:04.280
And so every heterosexual man who's experiencing attraction

20:04.280 --> 20:06.880
to a trans woman is necessarily experiencing

20:06.880 --> 20:09.580
heterosexual attraction because of the way

20:09.580 --> 20:12.380
the person he's attracted to identifies.

20:12.380 --> 20:13.340
But that's just replacing the black and white male and female

20:13.340 --> 20:15.720
with the black and white thinking of a biology dogma

20:15.720 --> 20:18.220
with the black and white thinking of an identity dogma.

20:18.220 --> 20:20.940
But human sexuality is not black and white.

20:20.940 --> 20:22.480
It's not even shades of gray.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.160
It's a multicolor acid trip.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.500
It's centaur Donna Summer charging at you

20:26.500 --> 20:27.620
with a spanking paddle.

20:27.620 --> 20:30.340
So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes,

20:30.340 --> 20:33.760
but it's not usually based on psychological identity either.

20:33.760 --> 20:36.140
Most of the time, initial attraction anyway

20:36.140 --> 20:38.360
is based on what I'd call presentation,

20:38.360 --> 20:39.640
how you look and act.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.380
And I think that's especially true of men.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.140
They get turned on by that initial visual pull,

20:43.140 --> 20:43.980
pop.

20:43.980 --> 20:46.280
They see, they conquer, they come.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.040
I mean, you have to admire the simplicity of it.

20:48.040 --> 20:50.260
Sometimes I wish I were a man.

20:50.260 --> 20:53.500
So look, if what you want is a woman who pops,

20:53.500 --> 20:56.240
then rest assured there are plenty of trans women who pop.

20:56.240 --> 20:57.760
Maybe you don't think I pop,

20:57.760 --> 20:59.180
but you'd be hard pressed to argue

20:59.180 --> 21:01.420
that any number of trans models and actresses

21:01.420 --> 21:03.840
don't pop as much as any cis woman pops.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.380
So the pop is undeniable.

21:05.380 --> 21:06.960
No one's questioning the pop.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.120
In fact, without the pop,

21:08.120 --> 21:09.300
it never would have occurred to men

21:09.300 --> 21:10.860
to call trans women traps

21:10.860 --> 21:12.380
because they wouldn't be trapped

21:12.380 --> 21:14.700
if they weren't attracted in the first place.

21:14.700 --> 21:16.700
But a lot of men seem to think that the pop,

21:16.700 --> 21:19.100
the visual presentation of a trans woman,

21:19.100 --> 21:21.260
is some kind of illusion or facade

21:21.260 --> 21:23.040
that at some point will be dropped,

21:23.040 --> 21:25.000
revealing that our womanhood is a sham

21:25.000 --> 21:26.200
and that we're really men.

21:26.200 --> 21:27.820
Now, here's a big difference

21:27.820 --> 21:30.060
between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen.

21:30.060 --> 21:31.800
If you date a cis drag queen,

21:31.800 --> 21:34.220
at some point, you're getting a man, honey,

21:34.220 --> 21:37.260
as explained by the only good YouTuber, Jasmine Masters.

21:37.260 --> 21:39.780
I don't wanna date nobody who wanna date me like this

21:39.780 --> 21:40.800
because this comes off,

21:40.800 --> 21:42.220
and you're not doing nothing with this.

21:42.220 --> 21:46.180
But if you date me, there's no de-dragging.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.160
There's no moment where I become a man.

21:48.160 --> 21:50.700
Baby, what you see is what you got.

21:50.700 --> 21:51.540
At least on this side.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.040
This is my natural side,

21:53.040 --> 21:55.820
and this is my biological side.

21:55.820 --> 21:57.240
When we're discussing people who are trans,

21:57.240 --> 21:59.060
we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman

21:59.060 --> 22:01.120
and then refer to them by their biological pronoun

22:01.120 --> 22:04.020
because biology is the nature of the pronoun, so.

22:04.020 --> 22:05.620
Everyone's always hating on trans women

22:05.620 --> 22:07.740
for being stereotypically feminine,

22:07.740 --> 22:09.480
so why do you think that in the bedroom

22:09.480 --> 22:10.740
we'd be any other way?

22:10.740 --> 22:12.140
Part of it is that people are really,

22:12.140 --> 22:14.220
really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy

22:14.220 --> 22:15.640
and what it does for trans women.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.880
It feminizes our skin, our smell,

22:17.880 --> 22:19.340
our body fat distribution.

22:19.340 --> 22:20.860
It makes us grow breasts.

22:20.860 --> 22:23.040
That's right, these are my very real,

22:23.040 --> 22:25.100
very biological titties.

22:25.100 --> 22:26.200
I mean, I'm wearing a push-up bra,

22:26.200 --> 22:27.980
but at least there's something to push up now.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.320
Here, I'll show you.

22:31.000 --> 22:31.920
I mean, they're small,

22:31.920 --> 22:34.260
but it's not by any measure a male chest,

22:34.260 --> 22:35.940
and what I have is very real,

22:35.940 --> 22:38.800
very biological, and very female.

22:38.800 --> 22:41.420
You people think everything to do with trans women is fake,

22:42.140 --> 22:43.920
it's fake boobs, fake hair,

22:43.920 --> 22:46.000
but that's prejudice more than observation.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.600
Like, I've noticed that whether or not

22:47.600 --> 22:49.420
I actually wear a wig in a video

22:49.420 --> 22:52.540
has exactly zero effect on how many people comment

22:52.540 --> 22:53.880
to call me a man in a wig,

22:53.880 --> 22:55.480
so I may as well just wear wigs,

22:55.480 --> 22:56.860
and I may as well get my boobs done, too,

22:56.860 --> 22:58.800
since people are gonna call them fake either way,

22:58.800 --> 23:00.960
but for what it's worth, this is my real hair,

23:00.960 --> 23:03.820
at least on this half, and these are my real boobs,

23:03.820 --> 23:06.260
and if I bring home a gentleman or a lady,

23:06.260 --> 23:07.760
all that stays on in bed,

23:07.760 --> 23:09.420
and it's there when I wake up in the morning,

23:09.420 --> 23:11.320
but what about the penis?

23:11.320 --> 23:12.140
All right!

23:12.140 --> 23:15.640
Look, if the penis is feminine, how is that gay?

23:15.640 --> 23:16.520
I rest my case.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.660
Roll credits.

23:19.500 --> 23:22.800
You can't make me lose.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.300
Six, the feminine penis.

23:25.300 --> 23:28.380
Look, some guys want the Ts and the D,

23:28.380 --> 23:29.480
and that's the T.

23:29.480 --> 23:32.060
Now, a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick,

23:32.060 --> 23:34.620
even a lady dick, makes any sexual interaction

23:34.620 --> 23:37.400
with a man gay, but isn't male homosexuality

23:37.400 --> 23:41.000
usually understood as attraction to men,

23:41.000 --> 23:42.120
and not merely to,

23:42.120 --> 23:45.120
penises, wherever they may arise?

23:45.120 --> 23:46.820
I think there probably are some gay men

23:46.820 --> 23:50.160
who really just like dick, and I'm not judging.

23:50.160 --> 23:52.300
I'm not here to attack anyone's preferences,

23:52.300 --> 23:53.760
but being a straight man,

23:53.760 --> 23:55.780
I don't really think that's best understood

23:55.780 --> 23:58.100
as a man attracted to vaginas.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.960
You call women pussy, but then you're always like,

23:59.960 --> 24:01.400
ew, period.

24:01.400 --> 24:02.500
I'm a straight man.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.800
I'm not used to putting a towel down when I fuck.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.020
I don't know how to use a condom

24:06.020 --> 24:08.200
because I expect cis women to be on birth control

24:08.200 --> 24:09.440
and do everything for me,

24:09.440 --> 24:10.120
and then you have straight incels online calling libies,

24:10.120 --> 24:11.120
and then you have straight incels online calling libies,

24:11.120 --> 24:12.120
and then you have straight incels online calling libies,

24:12.120 --> 24:13.260
and then you have straight incels online calling libies,

24:13.260 --> 24:15.660
and generally putting on a show of vaginal disgust.

24:15.660 --> 24:17.180
I mean, if you're gonna date cis women

24:17.180 --> 24:18.580
or post-op trans women,

24:18.580 --> 24:19.700
I think you owe it to them

24:19.700 --> 24:21.740
to be a little more vagina positive.

24:21.740 --> 24:23.020
Because even though straight men are like,

24:23.020 --> 24:24.740
ew, dicks, that's gay,

24:24.740 --> 24:26.920
you guys also kind of love dicks.

24:26.920 --> 24:28.180
You're always drawing them.

24:28.180 --> 24:29.860
Your buildings look like dicks.

24:29.860 --> 24:31.500
Your porn all has dicks in it.

24:31.500 --> 24:33.120
So what about dicks on chicks?

24:33.120 --> 24:35.360
Well, men like chicks and men like dicks,

24:35.360 --> 24:37.300
so what's the problem, officer?

24:37.300 --> 24:39.640
I think the booming popularity of T-girl porn

24:39.640 --> 24:40.520
speaks for itself.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.560
On PornHub,

24:41.560 --> 24:44.380
The shemale category contains more videos

24:44.380 --> 24:46.100
than other such popular categories

24:46.100 --> 24:48.840
as rough sex, orgy, and webcam,

24:48.840 --> 24:50.900
and it's mostly straight men who watch it.

24:50.900 --> 24:53.680
When adultempire.com moved their T-Girl content

24:53.680 --> 24:55.500
from their gay site to their straight site,

24:55.500 --> 24:57.120
views increased 50%.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.840
In 2016, the same year North Carolina passed

24:59.840 --> 25:02.560
a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom bill,

25:02.560 --> 25:04.940
the adult site Game Link's top-selling titles

25:04.940 --> 25:08.160
in North Carolina were My Transsexual Teacher,

25:08.160 --> 25:12.780
Shemale Shenanigans, and Joey Silvera's Transvisions 6.

25:12.780 --> 25:14.760
A lot of straight men first find out

25:14.760 --> 25:16.360
about trans women through porn,

25:16.360 --> 25:18.880
which isn't great since most T-Girl porn

25:18.880 --> 25:22.200
is not transpositive and uses dehumanizing slurs

25:22.200 --> 25:23.840
like shemale and tranny,

25:23.840 --> 25:25.480
which is how you end up living in a country

25:25.480 --> 25:27.480
full of people who will jerk off to you

25:27.480 --> 25:28.960
but won't give you rights.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.120
So to a lot of men, that's the representation we have.

25:32.120 --> 25:34.480
Shemales, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner.

25:34.480 --> 25:36.280
Great, I love that for us.

25:36.280 --> 25:37.800
Now there probably are some men

25:37.800 --> 25:40.480
who will always be put off by a woman's having a dick,

25:40.480 --> 25:41.560
and you know what?

25:41.560 --> 25:42.620
That's fine.

25:42.620 --> 25:46.660
Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage.

25:46.660 --> 25:47.840
You like what you like.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.920
I'm not here to police anyone's desires.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.040
In fact, quite the opposite.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.120
I'm here to liberate men of sophisticated taste

25:54.120 --> 25:56.360
from society's cruel and unjust prejudice

25:56.360 --> 25:58.060
against their T-Girl-loving ways.

25:58.060 --> 26:00.400
But liberation begins with understanding.

26:00.400 --> 26:02.880
So who are the men who love trans girls?

26:02.880 --> 26:04.820
Well, according to trans women I've talked to

26:04.820 --> 26:06.640
in my own personal experience,

26:06.640 --> 26:07.760
the men who date us can be

26:07.760 --> 26:09.980
divided into three general groups.

26:09.980 --> 26:12.720
Group one are men who, to be honest,

26:12.720 --> 26:15.000
are actually kind of put off by the dick,

26:15.000 --> 26:17.760
but they're so attracted to the woman it's attached to

26:17.760 --> 26:19.040
that they're willing to work around it

26:19.040 --> 26:22.020
or wait for it to grow on them.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.640
Group two are men who are attracted to trans women

26:25.640 --> 26:27.220
including their penises,

26:27.220 --> 26:29.900
but they don't specifically fetishize the penis,

26:29.900 --> 26:31.880
so they wouldn't mind if their trans lover

26:31.880 --> 26:34.000
had genital reassignment and got a vagina.

26:34.000 --> 26:35.280
And then group three are men

26:35.280 --> 26:37.480
who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks,

26:37.480 --> 26:41.220
and often want to worship the penis or be penetrated by it.

26:41.220 --> 26:44.340
Now group three are what the trans community calls chasers.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.480
Dating chasers is generally a bad idea

26:46.480 --> 26:47.840
because their attraction to us

26:47.840 --> 26:50.200
is based around fetishizing our genitals,

26:50.200 --> 26:51.440
which is often the part of us

26:51.440 --> 26:53.200
that we're most uncomfortable with.

26:53.200 --> 26:54.760
So if you're a T-Girl who likes men,

26:54.760 --> 26:57.140
group two is really Goldilocks perfection

26:57.140 --> 27:00.220
unless you really like topping or you've had the surgery.

27:00.220 --> 27:01.240
Now I should say that group two

27:01.240 --> 27:03.020
does include some bisexual men,

27:03.020 --> 27:04.720
and bisexual people of either gender

27:04.720 --> 27:06.680
can be great partners if you're trans.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.460
You like girls, you like dick.

27:08.460 --> 27:09.680
I'm a girl with a dick.

27:09.680 --> 27:10.800
Let's make this happen.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.240
That said, if someone views that part of me as male

27:13.240 --> 27:15.640
and wants me to do with it what men do with it,

27:15.640 --> 27:17.240
then pass, not interested.

27:17.240 --> 27:18.560
Now, you might be wondering,

27:18.560 --> 27:22.380
what is this post-modern neo-Marxist SJW insanity?

27:22.380 --> 27:24.660
How could I view it as anything other than a male part?

27:24.660 --> 27:25.940
It's a fucking penis!

27:25.940 --> 27:27.460
Well, I'm glad you asked.

27:27.460 --> 27:30.560
I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone

27:30.560 --> 27:32.960
about the ecstasies of the feminine penis.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.880
You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine.

27:36.680 --> 27:38.500
Usage and physiology.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.060
So first, context.

27:40.060 --> 27:42.860
Picture in your mind's eye a feminine woman.

27:42.860 --> 27:44.960
Now, picture her with a penis.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.760
That's not a man's penis, that's a woman's penis.

27:47.760 --> 27:50.760
It's feminine because of the context that it's in.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.280
Second, usage.

27:52.280 --> 27:54.460
A lesson in penis etiquette.

27:54.460 --> 27:57.860
A gentleman need not be coy about his penis.

27:57.860 --> 28:00.420
He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug,

28:00.420 --> 28:02.860
he may penetrate, he may order you to get on your knees

28:02.860 --> 28:04.280
like a good girl and .

28:06.680 --> 28:10.240
As it is a truth universally acknowledged

28:10.240 --> 28:14.760
that a lady of good breeding never brandishes her penis.

28:14.760 --> 28:16.360
When she rises from the bath,

28:16.360 --> 28:19.400
she covers it gracefully with a demure hand,

28:19.400 --> 28:23.140
and when not in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away.

28:23.140 --> 28:26.240
Here's how to tuck your penis like a lady.

28:26.240 --> 28:30.800
The first step is to put on a set of vicious stiletto claws.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.860
This doesn't make things any easier,

28:32.860 --> 28:34.820
but it does build character.

28:34.820 --> 28:36.660
Next, you want to take not one, but two, two, three, four,

28:36.660 --> 28:40.100
but two pairs of cotton-lined, polyspandex,

28:40.100 --> 28:43.700
bikini-cut panties, at least one size too small,

28:43.700 --> 28:45.980
and pull them most of the way up your legs.

28:45.980 --> 28:49.840
Now, there's just no way to put this delicately, my dears.

28:49.840 --> 28:51.340
You're gonna take your claw,

28:51.340 --> 28:53.220
and you're gonna grab your scrotum,

28:53.220 --> 28:55.040
and you're gonna yank that bubble gum

28:55.040 --> 28:56.380
back into your peach crease.

28:56.380 --> 28:58.060
Now hold it back with one hand,

28:58.060 --> 29:00.780
and with your other hand, push your penis back,

29:00.780 --> 29:03.820
pressing those little legs up into your pelvis.

29:03.820 --> 29:06.220
Bring your thighs together to hold everything in place,

29:06.220 --> 29:07.900
and then pull your panties up.

29:07.900 --> 29:11.060
Front first, then back, run your hand over it

29:11.060 --> 29:13.400
to make sure nothing's seeping out the sides,

29:13.400 --> 29:16.820
and then voila, it's like it was never there.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.980
For more information, you can purchase my book,

29:18.980 --> 29:21.100
Tuck Your Penis, with a new foreword

29:21.100 --> 29:22.940
by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

29:22.940 --> 29:24.720
I've now explained both the context

29:24.720 --> 29:26.920
and the usage of the feminine penis,

29:26.920 --> 29:28.980
so let us now turn to physiology.

29:28.980 --> 29:31.640
Most people don't realize that taking feminizing hormones

29:31.640 --> 29:34.240
actually changes the anatomy and functionality

29:34.240 --> 29:36.100
of the genitals, shrinking everything

29:36.100 --> 29:38.200
down and softening everything up.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.540
That means changes to a little thing

29:40.540 --> 29:42.480
not a lot of people are talking about,

29:42.480 --> 29:44.920
but something I've been trying to raise awareness of,

29:44.920 --> 29:47.920
you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue,

29:47.920 --> 29:52.920
really get people talking about seven, the mouth feel.

29:58.180 --> 30:03.180
Oh hi, it's me, Natalie Nguyen, your tasting specialist.

30:03.400 --> 30:05.280
I have tasted everything.

30:06.100 --> 30:08.840
Both the trans and the oral penis.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.220
And I've been able to discover that this is almost

30:11.220 --> 30:14.820
the same thing as the royal flush of oral sex.

30:14.820 --> 30:18.200
Girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy,

30:18.200 --> 30:21.660
and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris.

30:21.660 --> 30:25.560
But today, we amuse the palate with the feminine penis.

30:25.560 --> 30:29.160
Now, with respect to flavor, the feminine penis

30:29.160 --> 30:31.880
has more sweetness than the masculine penis

30:31.880 --> 30:35.880
and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick, umami.

30:36.100 --> 30:42.220
To mouthfeel, the feminine penis is of course softer and smoother than the masculine penis

30:42.220 --> 30:44.400
and does not become as turgid.

30:44.400 --> 30:51.860
And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes

30:51.860 --> 30:57.880
of saline, whereas boy cum is milky, viscous, and more acidic.

30:57.880 --> 31:06.020
It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers that sucking a female penis is not gay.

31:06.020 --> 31:07.020
Cheers!

31:14.120 --> 31:17.120
8. Being straight is pretty gay

31:17.120 --> 31:21.880
So I've been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women, but ultimately,

31:21.880 --> 31:26.980
you kinda just need to try it yourself to fully, viscerally understand why sex with

31:26.980 --> 31:29.380
a trans woman is sex with a woman.

31:29.380 --> 31:33.900
Now, we must always be wary of being overly simplistic in our thinking.

31:33.900 --> 31:34.900
Sexuality is complicated.

31:34.900 --> 31:35.900
And while it's undeniable,

31:35.900 --> 31:42.080
that many straight men are attracted to trans women, the messy reality is that a lot of

31:42.080 --> 31:45.340
straight men are also attracted to male cross-dressers.

31:45.340 --> 31:49.320
Before I transitioned, I was a cross-dresser, and I didn't present super womanly either,

31:49.320 --> 31:51.680
like fully Dr. Frankenfurter.

31:51.680 --> 31:53.300
And that's why I'm so iconic.

31:53.300 --> 31:58.340
I showed the world that in two years, you can transition from literally Dr. Frankenfurter

31:58.340 --> 32:02.020
to a very real, very biological drag queen.

32:02.020 --> 32:05.000
But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite, I still got sex with a woman.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.680
I still got semi-regular messages from men being like,

32:08.680 --> 32:14.100
So, I'm a straight man, but I'm like, really attracted to you when you dress as a woman

32:14.100 --> 32:17.120
and it's really making me question my sexuality.

32:17.120 --> 32:21.620
Now, I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like, well maybe those men

32:21.620 --> 32:26.480
just picked up on my inherently womanly, female energy essence that I've always had since

32:26.480 --> 32:31.500
I was born a female, biological soul trapped in the body of a cross-dressing baby.

32:31.500 --> 32:32.500
But let's be real.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.000
There are straight men who fuck cross-dressers.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.000
There are straight men who fuck cross-dressers.

32:35.000 --> 32:37.000
There are straight men who fuck drag queens.

32:37.000 --> 32:41.760
There are straight-identifying men who fuck other straight-identifying men.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.040
What is going on here?

32:43.040 --> 32:44.040
Straight men, what is your deal?

32:44.040 --> 32:45.040
Who are you?

32:45.040 --> 32:46.040
What is your life?

32:46.040 --> 32:47.040
How did you become straight?

32:47.040 --> 32:48.180
Did they recruit you?

32:48.180 --> 32:49.540
Were you groomed?

32:49.540 --> 32:50.540
I blame the parents.

32:50.540 --> 32:54.380
Let's go back to the game you guys like to play, the one I call, Is This Gay?

32:54.380 --> 32:59.380
The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that they're sex acts between people

32:59.380 --> 33:00.380
of the same gender.

33:00.380 --> 33:04.760
But I've heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that's gay.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.660
Or that it's gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples.

33:08.660 --> 33:13.540
To be clear, we're talking about one man and one woman, Eve sucking Adam's nipples, and

33:13.540 --> 33:16.020
according to these men, it's totally gay.

33:16.020 --> 33:21.120
What that shows is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a

33:21.120 --> 33:22.180
man and a woman.

33:22.180 --> 33:26.560
It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who

33:26.560 --> 33:28.400
are playing the correct roles.

33:28.400 --> 33:32.640
So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according

33:32.640 --> 33:34.760
to this very fragile view of heterosexuality,

33:35.000 --> 33:37.060
he ceases to be straight.

33:37.060 --> 33:41.400
Even a man's own relationship with his body is policed by these narrow confines.

33:41.400 --> 33:46.580
For instance, some men won't even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary

33:46.580 --> 33:51.560
twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos.

33:51.560 --> 33:54.920
I mean to be fair, before I washed my asshole, I was a quarterback.

33:54.920 --> 33:55.920
Now I'm a cheerleader.

33:55.920 --> 33:59.800
B-I-C-T-R-O, why don't tell the coach I was a guy?

33:59.800 --> 34:04.440
This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me

34:04.440 --> 34:09.320
of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation.

34:09.320 --> 34:13.260
Basically it's a style of moral thinking that treats the body like a temple that must

34:13.260 --> 34:17.900
be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can fuck

34:17.900 --> 34:21.680
and what you can eat, so for example religious dietary laws.

34:21.680 --> 34:27.660
I think this hyper-masculine hetero-man code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of

34:27.660 --> 34:32.500
kosher law governing straightness, and the is this gay game is its theology.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.600
Now this whole line of thinking has been reducing over the years.

34:33.600 --> 34:34.300
I'm not sure if it's true or not.

34:34.300 --> 34:39.180
It was introduced to absurdity pretty effectively by, of all people, Count Dankula.

34:39.180 --> 34:44.860
If you class yourself as a straight man, and you're masturbating, that means that you're

34:44.860 --> 34:47.420
touching a dick, and that's gay.

34:47.420 --> 34:50.340
Well memed my lord, well memed.

34:50.340 --> 34:55.620
The pinnacle of the whole conversation is reached when Dankula concludes that since a woman inherits

34:55.620 --> 35:01.260
half her DNA from her father, she's technically half a man, and therefore having sex with a

35:01.260 --> 35:03.840
woman is pretty gay.

35:04.300 --> 35:08.940
Obviously this is shit-posting, but it's logically just as good an argument as traps

35:08.940 --> 35:10.840
are gay because chromosomes.

35:10.840 --> 35:15.140
So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay.

35:15.140 --> 35:17.360
So what is being gay?

35:17.360 --> 35:18.360
Socrates.

35:18.360 --> 35:19.360
Hmm.

35:19.360 --> 35:22.400
On second thought, I don't know her.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.400
9.

35:23.400 --> 35:25.800
Being gay is good actually.

35:25.800 --> 35:29.060
Sometimes when you've been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it's

35:29.060 --> 35:32.540
good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the

35:32.540 --> 35:33.540
first place?

35:33.540 --> 35:36.820
Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight?

35:36.820 --> 35:41.660
It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with

35:41.660 --> 35:45.420
manhood, and they defend their manhood at all costs.

35:45.420 --> 35:49.780
Now men, this might be difficult to hear, and maybe you don't want to hear it from me,

35:49.780 --> 35:54.800
but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it's hurting cis women, and it's hurting trans

35:54.800 --> 35:56.860
women, and it's hurting gay people.

35:56.860 --> 35:59.720
For one thing, it makes you really really bad at sex.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.180
Who wants to sleep with a guy who is so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can't even

36:02.180 --> 36:03.180
have sex?

36:03.540 --> 36:05.480
He can't even enjoy his own body.

36:05.480 --> 36:08.380
Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay.

36:08.380 --> 36:10.680
Being pegged does not make you gay.

36:10.680 --> 36:15.260
Sucking another man's dick, just to try it, does not make you gay.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.260
And why?

36:16.260 --> 36:21.540
Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is

36:21.540 --> 36:24.740
persistently attracted to people of the same gender.

36:24.740 --> 36:28.480
If you're persistently attracted to people of the same gender, and you identify with

36:28.480 --> 36:30.840
the word gay, then you're gay.

36:30.840 --> 36:31.660
If not, then you're not.

36:31.660 --> 36:32.660
And nothing you can do will change that.

36:32.660 --> 36:33.160
9.

36:33.540 --> 36:34.540
Being Gay

36:34.540 --> 36:38.780
So that's one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is

36:38.780 --> 36:39.780
good actually.

36:39.780 --> 36:43.220
I mean, why would you be worried about this if you didn't think being gay was bad?

36:43.220 --> 36:48.060
Now, I don't identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense.

36:48.060 --> 36:49.060
We the gays.

36:49.060 --> 36:55.240
But as a queer person, I can't help but be a little bit wounded by the fact that straight

36:55.240 --> 36:59.200
men are so obsessed with proving that they aren't like us.

36:59.200 --> 37:02.160
But that is not a wound I am going to dwell on.

37:02.160 --> 37:03.480
Because life is much too short for that.

37:03.480 --> 37:07.880
I don't want to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage.

37:07.880 --> 37:08.880
Are traps gay?

37:08.880 --> 37:09.880
Baby, who cares?

37:09.880 --> 37:10.880
Just do it feels good.

37:10.880 --> 37:16.940
That's the simple answer, but the truth is that when people say, traps are gay but there's

37:16.940 --> 37:21.600
nothing wrong with being gay, that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men

37:21.600 --> 37:27.240
and to reinforce the stigma against dating us among the group of people who are in fact

37:27.240 --> 37:28.900
most attracted to us.

37:28.900 --> 37:32.720
Because it is mostly straight men and not gay men who like us.

37:32.720 --> 37:37.380
And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted

37:37.380 --> 37:39.980
to us are willing to openly date us.

37:39.980 --> 37:42.020
And the stigma is very real.

37:42.020 --> 37:47.080
A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness.

37:47.080 --> 37:51.960
Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they

37:51.960 --> 37:57.200
experience, in short, a sample of the difficulty all queer people face.

37:57.200 --> 38:02.120
But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices

38:02.120 --> 38:04.000
control his life.

38:04.000 --> 38:09.900
A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.

38:09.900 --> 38:16.000
A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves.

38:16.000 --> 38:23.800
And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I'm still more of a

38:23.800 --> 38:25.060
man than you.

38:32.120 --> 38:35.100
10.

38:35.100 --> 38:37.000
I have feelings too.

38:37.000 --> 38:43.640
Well, I guess today we learned that Are Traps Gay? is not a debate worth winning, because

38:43.640 --> 38:48.740
just by participating, we're accepting the validity of an insincere question and the

38:48.740 --> 38:51.160
bigoted assumptions it relies on.

38:51.160 --> 38:55.500
Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is

38:55.500 --> 38:56.500
deserved.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.840
Hashtag not all gamers.

38:57.840 --> 39:01.120
But also, this video completely centers men's feelings.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.120

39:02.120 --> 39:04.320
And I have feelings too, goddammit.

39:04.320 --> 39:09.340
And some of those feelings are not all that different from the anxieties men have.

39:09.340 --> 39:12.060
Let me explain.

39:12.060 --> 39:13.060
Let me explain.

39:13.060 --> 39:18.000
So I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology

39:18.000 --> 39:19.920
for confused slutbag.

39:19.920 --> 39:24.880
Before I transitioned, I dated women, and I still do have lesbicious and lesbinaical

39:24.880 --> 39:25.880
feelings.

39:25.880 --> 39:30.380
But early in my transition, I encountered a lot of TERF shit, and it really scared me

39:30.380 --> 39:31.100
off dating cis lesbians.

39:31.100 --> 39:32.100
Which I never did.

39:32.120 --> 39:33.120
Which I never have.

39:33.120 --> 39:36.740
Even before I transitioned, the question, do I want to fuck men, had been in the back

39:36.740 --> 39:38.680
of my head for a long time.

39:38.680 --> 39:42.160
But about a year ago, I was like, I want to fuck men.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.240
I want to fuck men.

39:44.240 --> 39:48.280
But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.280
Because men are scary.

39:49.280 --> 39:53.360
And in my early transition, I'd only dated bisexual trans people and enbies.

39:53.360 --> 39:56.780
And as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory.

39:56.780 --> 40:00.040
A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.280
That teaches you something about gender.

40:01.280 --> 40:01.920
It might be hard to believe.

40:02.120 --> 40:03.120
It might be hard to learn otherwise.

40:03.120 --> 40:09.620
And loving a trans woman, like, I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I'm a real

40:09.620 --> 40:10.620
woman.

40:10.620 --> 40:15.380
But to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as like the radiant model

40:15.380 --> 40:19.340
of womanhood, that's an experience that's meant a lot to me.

40:19.340 --> 40:23.680
And if you're attracted to women, and that's an experience you haven't had, you're missing

40:23.680 --> 40:24.680
out.

40:24.680 --> 40:28.160
But what I was going to say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a pretty safe group

40:28.160 --> 40:30.680
of people to date when you're early in transition.

40:30.680 --> 40:32.120
Because they're pretty chill about anatomy.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.120
And presentation.

40:33.120 --> 40:36.960
But if you're going to date cishet men, you need to be serving women.

40:36.960 --> 40:39.800
And I guess you don't need to, but it doesn't hurt.

40:39.800 --> 40:42.000
And I did wonder if I was woman enough for it.

40:42.000 --> 40:46.000
So the first couple of times I was so afraid, I was like, when I take my clothes off, is

40:46.000 --> 40:48.280
he going to think I'm a man?

40:48.280 --> 40:50.720
Basically my anxiety was, are traps gay?

40:50.720 --> 40:53.360
But what I ended up doing is just working up to things gradually.

40:53.360 --> 40:55.620
And of course, you start by sucking dick.

40:55.620 --> 41:00.620
That's very safe, because like, what red blooded man is going to turn down a t-girl blowjob?

41:00.620 --> 41:01.560
And it doesn't involve my dick.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.080
It's not my dick.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.120
It's not my junk in any way.

41:03.120 --> 41:07.840
But then I got a little bolder, and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned,

41:07.840 --> 41:09.460
we'd been guy friends.

41:09.460 --> 41:14.120
So to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between a man and a woman,

41:14.120 --> 41:16.300
like, that shit is super hot.

41:16.300 --> 41:20.360
Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk, and I let a straight guy go down on

41:20.360 --> 41:24.960
me, and I was so nervous about that, because like, what if he thinks I'm a man?

41:24.960 --> 41:26.360
What if he's repulsed?

41:26.360 --> 41:29.500
Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked?

41:29.500 --> 41:31.360
The answer is yes.

41:31.360 --> 41:33.680
It was so hot.

41:33.680 --> 41:34.680
I loved it.

41:34.680 --> 41:35.680
He loved it.

41:35.680 --> 41:41.120
And just knowing that he'd never done that before, but I would just say it's special.

41:41.120 --> 41:42.120
Ten out of ten.

41:42.120 --> 41:44.740
And you know what he told me after?

41:44.740 --> 41:48.800
He told me he liked the mouth feel.

41:48.800 --> 41:51.360
Everyone's talking about it now, bitches.

41:51.360 --> 41:56.560
So look, I really don't want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women,

41:56.560 --> 41:59.360
because I mean, I was anxious too, in the other direction.

41:59.360 --> 42:00.360
But I do want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women, because I mean,

42:00.360 --> 42:01.360
I was anxious too, in the other direction.

42:01.360 --> 42:04.440
I do want to shame men for treating trans women like they're dirty little secrets.

42:04.440 --> 42:08.780
And I do want to shame men for dehumanizing us and voting away our rights by day, while

42:08.780 --> 42:10.980
jerking off to shemale porn by night.

42:10.980 --> 42:15.020
And I do want to shame men for refusing to date us because they're not fucking strong

42:15.020 --> 42:20.320
enough to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every

42:20.320 --> 42:21.680
moment of every day.

42:21.680 --> 42:26.140
And I do want to shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends because they couldn't

42:26.140 --> 42:29.600
stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes.

42:29.600 --> 42:30.600
That is pathetic.

42:30.600 --> 42:35.480
If you're so worried about proving you're a man, why don't you start by standing up

42:35.480 --> 42:38.780
for the women you love, you chicken shit cowards.

42:38.780 --> 42:41.920
So look, what I'm asking for is so basic.

42:41.920 --> 42:43.760
Don't call human beings traps.

42:43.760 --> 42:46.720
If you're attracted to trans women, don't be ashamed of it.

42:46.720 --> 42:48.640
It's okay, you can date us.

42:48.640 --> 42:50.600
We're more than just jack off material.

42:50.600 --> 42:53.920
If you aren't attracted to trans women, respect the people who are.

42:53.920 --> 42:57.880
If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess, because god knows she's been

42:57.880 --> 42:58.880
through enough shit.

42:58.880 --> 42:59.880
And finally, protect her.

42:59.880 --> 43:03.660
Protect trans women of color at all costs.

43:03.660 --> 43:06.320
All I want here is basic human decency.

43:06.320 --> 43:08.980
Is that really too much to ask?

43:08.980 --> 43:14.860
Well, this is the internet, so yes, yes it is.

43:14.860 --> 43:16.940
God damn it.

43:16.940 --> 43:21.980
Well, that was long.

43:21.980 --> 43:29.720
I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud said,

43:29.720 --> 43:35.520
sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful woman's penis.

43:35.520 --> 43:53.720
You must think that you are so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully,

43:53.720 --> 43:56.720
unaware of how crude, hurt before, bigoted, and plain rude.

43:56.720 --> 43:57.720
But you're not.

43:57.720 --> 43:58.720
You're not.

43:58.720 --> 43:59.720
You're not.

43:59.720 --> 44:13.520
Oh my god, think about all the things that you have said to us.

44:13.520 --> 44:17.200
All the things that you say come up everyday.

44:17.200 --> 44:24.520
There is one thing that I cannot stand.

44:24.520 --> 44:25.720
And it's you dear, head in the sand.

44:25.720 --> 44:26.680
It's not really ignorance of mine.

44:26.680 --> 44:27.680
It's the willful bigot's avocado.

44:27.680 --> 44:28.680
Oh.

44:28.680 --> 44:35.960
There is one thing that I cannot stand

44:35.960 --> 44:38.720
And it's you, dear, head in the sand

44:38.720 --> 44:43.340
There's no release from ignorance in my mind

44:43.340 --> 44:46.520
Just the willful bigots who find us

44:46.520 --> 44:50.240
Don't let them define us
