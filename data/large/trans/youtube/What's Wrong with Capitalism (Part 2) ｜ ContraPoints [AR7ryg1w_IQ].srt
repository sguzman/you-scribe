1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,920
Like stuff I like this and I like this and I like this I

3
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:29,720
Like stuff and I want more stuff

4
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:37,780
My child hearken to my voice. It is I Socrates. Oh, no. What do you want?

5
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,360
I haven't seen you at the symposium of late

6
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:46,680
Well, yeah, because you kind of hate women and it was getting me down my child without my guidance

7
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,680
You have become a slave to mere appetite

8
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,820
Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness the rational contemplation of truth and justice?

9
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,140
Look, I tried that and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,260
I'm a dum-dum and I like shiny things. Ah, but my child these are pleasures for the pigs

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,700
Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself

12
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:15,080
Perfectly exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys

13
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,640
Okay, thank you for your feedback. We'll take that away

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,260
I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things and these are questions really better left to the philosophers

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,380
Which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this video

16
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,300
Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works of anti-capitalist philosophy ever produced

17
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:38,300
A series in multiple volumes that examines deeply the importance of the idea of happiness

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,300
And I hope you enjoy it

19
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,300
And I hope you enjoy it

20
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:44,300
And I hope you enjoy it

21
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,300
And I hope you enjoy it

22
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,300
And I hope you enjoy it

23
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,680
And I hope you enjoy it

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,680
And I hope you enjoy it

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,680
And I hope you enjoy it

26
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
I'll see you in the next video

27
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,640
and a $1 ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold,

28
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,880
and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel that's made of gold.

29
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,000
It is a lot of gold.

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

31
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,800
A gongipreneur!

32
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,440
Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder.

33
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,560
But we intellectuals, well, we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.

34
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,800
We like to take it all in.

35
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,520
Ah!

36
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:50,440
The Worth It boys, Andrew, Adam, Steven, these are not mere content creators,

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,360
mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad revenue.

38
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:59,640
They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even, and what they've accomplished on YouTube,

39
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:04,200
quite honestly, far surpasses the combined insights of Marx, Engels,

40
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,560
Lenin, Sartre, Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, LukÃ¡cs, Zarathustra,

41
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,120
and even our dear bread mom, Kropotkin.

42
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
I've of course read each of these great thinkers

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,520
completely.

44
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,360
It works many, many times.

45
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:20,760
But I always come away dissatisfied, and I find myself returning, yet again,

46
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,360
to the unparalleled masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:29,000
See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,680
Is it worth it?

49
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,800
We may never know.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,920
Take, for instance, the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.

51
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,680
Which is the better deal?

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:42,440
I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?

53
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,120
Well, according to Karl Marx,

54
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,320
the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.

55
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:53,000
On the one hand, there's the use value, the commodity's capacity to satisfy some human need.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,040
And on the other hand, there is the exchange value,

57
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,760
the quantity determining the ratio by which a commodity is exchangeable with every other

58
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,360
commodity, deriving from objectified labor over time and expressed in terms of price.

59
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,360
But let's not oversimplify things.

60
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,960
Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us, the viewers of Worth It, to understand,

61
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:19,640
the use-value-exchange-value dichotomy, not as a mere hierarchical binary,

62
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,680
but as a sort of Deleuzian rhizome, a non-arborescent multiplicity,

63
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,000
with as many sinuous interconnections as the truffles on the pizza itself.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,600
Am I making myself clear?

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,160
I'm not.

66
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:34,840
It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon

67
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,160
and not actually helping me think through this any better.

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:42,120
So, let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.

69
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,080
Fuck this!

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:53,640
I like stuff.

71
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,160
And I like shiny things.

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,240
Now, that's something everyone can understand,

73
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:02,360
so let's take that as the first axiom of the economic theory I'll be developing in this video.

74
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:06,040
So, given that I like stuff and I like shiny things,

75
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,480
let's return to the question.

76
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,120
Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?

77
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,640
Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny,

78
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,000
so I do like that.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,440
But the pizza itself seems kinda gross.

80
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,320
It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras,

81
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,400
stilton cheese, black truffles, gold flakes, and caviar.

82
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,920
These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.

83
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:32,200
The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,560
It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment.

85
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,040
But Andrew and Steven sit there with New York's financial district for a backdrop,

86
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,320
and they try to pretend that the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.

87
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:48,840
I'm honestly speechless.

88
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,720
I feel weird.

89
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,520
Is it the gold?

90
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,200
I just ate $250.

91
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I feel kinda like I'm committing a crime.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,680
And that's what $1,250 looks like.

93
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,600
There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza

94
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,320
isn't worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.

95
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,080
It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money

96
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,720
on some gilded piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.

97
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,560
Is there a name for that feeling?

98
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:23,080
Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.

99
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,280
In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia,

100
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,600
a bad pizza covered in gold would just be a bad pizza covered in gold.

101
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,880
You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza,

102
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,960
but you probably wouldn't be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.

103
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,800
To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it,

104
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,280
you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.

105
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:42,520
You have to understand it in a way that is not worth it, and you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.

106
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,080
You have to understand it in a way that is not worth it, and you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.

107
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,920
in the context of capitalism.

108
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,320
The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza,

109
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:53,320
and if you live in America, you have an instinctive sense for what that means,

110
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:56,680
because you know all the other things you could buy with $2,000.

111
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,360
For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or health care, or golden nails.

112
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,720
And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening

113
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,520
worrying about how they're going to afford golden nails.

114
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,280
And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem

115
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:12,680
And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem

116
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,400
not just aesthetically disappointing, but almost obscene, or even immoral.

117
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,640
But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.

118
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,280
So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go

119
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,040
Pizzas in Africa could have eaten those children, how dare you!

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,480
Because the problem isn't that Andrew, Adam, and Steven are bad people

121
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:35,000
for buying an expensive flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.

122
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,080
The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable

123
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,600
these repulsive juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.

124
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,800
That's why I don't really agree with a philosopher, Peter Singer,

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,240
who has this idea that many of the world's problems could be solved

126
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:53,160
if privileged American college students would just become hedge fund managers

127
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,680
and donate most of their income to buying mosquito nets in the Congo.

128
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,640
I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations,

129
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:03,560
but it's not going to change the fact that the global economy is structured around

130
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,880
cheap, exploited labor at the bottom, and $2,000 pizzas at the top.

131
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:12,520
Another way to approach this issue might be to ask, who are the goddamn reptiles?

132
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,920
Well, they're certainly not the Jews.

133
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:19,960
I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page, that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.

134
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,480
Except, you know, cucking the white race.

135
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,720
But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.

136
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,960
The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.

137
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,640
So the lizards are not the Jews.

138
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,960
They're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis.

139
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,080
They're not freemasons or globalists or the gay agenda.

140
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,000
But the key insight is that they're not even really the capitalists.

141
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,640
The lizards are capital itself.

142
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,120
And what are they?

143
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:42,360
They're the capitalists.

144
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:42,440
They're the capitalists.

145
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:42,520
They're the capitalists.

146
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:42,580
They're the capitalists.

147
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:42,600
They're the capitalists.

148
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,480
What does that mean?

149
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,600
Well, I don't know.

150
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,320
But it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?

151
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,760
What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy are not just the product

152
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,040
of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.

153
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,160
Of course, some capitalists are terrible people.

154
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,680
But some probably aren't.

155
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,920
And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.

156
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,320
So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact that the extreme

157
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,640
economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.

158
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:12,440
If I were to translate this into English, I would say that the golden pizza is the

159
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,680
golden pizza.

160
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,480
If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument, it would go

161
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,600
something like this.

162
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,560
Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic system because, although it's good at creating

163
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,120
large amounts of wealth, it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way, where

164
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,320
efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth, but as the capacity

165
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,000
to maximize human happiness.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,160
Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.

167
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,040
Here's a question.

168
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,800
Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?

169
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,420
It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve the economy.

170
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,300
It should serve humanity.

171
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:47,700
So what I look for in a good economic system is that it produces the most happiness for

172
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,060
the people who are a part of it.

173
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:52,820
So if you're willing to go along with this, the first question we should ask is, does

174
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,060
having more wealth make people happier?

175
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:59,540
And we actually have data about that, at least within the context of our own economic system.

176
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:04,260
And the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness, up to a certain point.

177
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:10,180
But the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus somewhere between $65,000 and $95,000

178
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:10,660
a year.

179
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:10,740
That's a lot of money.

180
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:10,820
That's a lot of money.

181
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:10,900
That's a lot of money.

182
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:10,980
That's a lot of money.

183
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,060
That's a lot of money.

184
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:11,300
That's a lot of money.

185
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:11,540
That's a lot of money.

186
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:11,620
That's a lot of money.

187
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:11,700
That's a lot of money.

188
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:11,780
That's a lot of money.

189
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:16,020
And the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold is that at lower income

190
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:21,380
levels, more income means less stress about paying rent, or mortgages, or medical bills,

191
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:22,500
or college tuition.

192
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:27,380
But once you pass the threshold, more income basically just translates into more disappointing

193
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,500
golden pizzas.

194
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,940
If that interpretation is correct, then the current income distribution seems really irrational,

195
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,260
at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.

196
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:40,900
The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme, so that

197
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,740
the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone, but the national

198
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:51,060
median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.

199
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:58,180
Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year, several times the

200
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,700
peak happiness threshold.

201
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:04,980
So at least to my naive eyes, what it looks like is that millions of people in this country

202
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:10,260
don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and healthcare,

203
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:15,460
while a few million others are, like, constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.

204
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,780
But I'm guessing it's even worse than that.

205
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:21,780
Because it's not just that some people don't have enough money to meet all of their needs,

206
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,700
it's that they have to be poor while other people are rich.

207
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:30,580
And since people compare themselves to others, that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties

208
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,740
and resentments and social tensions.

209
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:37,060
There's a study of capuchin monkeys that shows if you reward one monkey for a task

210
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,100
with a delicious grape, and a monkey in the adjacent cage

211
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:44,100
with a shitty cucumber, the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.

212
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:48,180
And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.

213
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,020
But that's just how it looks to me.

214
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:50,900
I could be wrong.

215
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:56,100
I mean, I'm not an economic theorist, and honestly, I don't really understand how the

216
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,060
economy works.

217
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,940
I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.

218
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,660
I make the videos, I swipe the card.

219
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:07,780
So look, if I'm wrong and capitalism is good, actually, just leave a comment and I'll be

220
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,140
happy to be proven wrong.

221
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:09,940
But before you do that, I want to thank you for watching this video.

222
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,020
I hope you enjoyed it, and I'll see you in the next one.

223
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:10,080
Bye!

224
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,220
But let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.

225
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:17,220
Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.

226
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,300
Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.

227
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:25,940
Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.

228
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:29,940
And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs just to sustain

229
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,300
themselves and their families.

230
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,980
It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.

231
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,620
But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.

232
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,940
Why would anyone become an innovator or medical

233
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,660
researcher if they could make a good living as a janitor?

234
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:46,420
Well, janitorial work is pretty important, actually.

235
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:50,740
Someone has to cook and clean, and I think people who do such necessary work deserve

236
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,540
a decent living.

237
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:55,620
But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring, and I think that the

238
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,740
kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent often isn't driven mainly by profit

239
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,300
anyway.

240
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,460
Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine, even though he could have made millions of

241
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:09,860
dollars from it, because he just cared about humanity, and he was driven by a purpose,

242
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,460
beyond personal profit.

243
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,180
In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people who didn't need to

244
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:20,660
work for a living at all, and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.

245
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,180
So let me get this straight.

246
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,980
You criticise capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.

247
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,100
Hypocrite much?

248
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,140
A few years ago, I was a broke philosophy graduate student, and when I criticised capitalism

249
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,740
then, people used to say,

250
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,940
Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?

251
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,620
You just resent capitalism because you don't have enough money to make a living.

252
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:39,780
You don't have enough money to make a living.

253
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:39,860
You don't have enough money to make a living.

254
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,500
You're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.

255
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:47,300
So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticise it because they're just resentful,

256
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:51,700
and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticise it because they're hypocrites,

257
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:56,340
then, according to you, is anyone allowed to criticise capitalism?

258
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,820
Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.

259
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,260
You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?

260
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,540
Well, no, I wouldn't.

261
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,460
Hello.

262
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,140
I'm Tatyana Tankikova.

263
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,780
I'm here to...

264
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,300
I'm here to defend Stalin.

265
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,940
Fuck off!

266
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,340
Do svidaniya, fascist.

267
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,020
Do svidaniya, fascist.

268
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,540
So, granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty.

269
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:23,380
But that doesn't mean that the current system is the best and final system for all time.

270
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:28,180
My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,

271
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,620
but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.

272
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,660
Okay, but I like stuff.

273
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,180
I like stuff too.

274
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,700
I think a lot of people have this instinct,

275
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,620
this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes, so does everything we love.

276
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,540
I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity,

277
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:54,420
scarcity, conformity, undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,

278
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,860
just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.

279
00:14:57,860 --> 00:15:00,980
And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,

280
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:04,500
since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.

281
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,540
But the stuff I'm worried about â booze, makeup, art, baths â these things existed,

282
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,580
long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.

283
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,860
And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about.

284
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,900
Straight guys will be like,

285
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,020
Will there be video games after capitalism? Oh god!

286
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,380
And yeah, there will be.

287
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:24,660
Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.

288
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,780
Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved,

289
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,100
if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.

290
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,940
I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.

291
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,340
The last time I was reading the,

292
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:42,740
only book I've ever read, Ways of Seeing by John Berger,

293
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,580
I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.

294
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,700
Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.

295
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,820
Happiness as judged from the outside by others.

296
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,180
The happiness of being envied is glamour.

297
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:00,180
And I felt kind of attacked, because glamour is very important to us.

298
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,940
And by us, I mean the gays.

299
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:07,460
The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy Qs.

300
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,980
But isn't it kind of true that,

301
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,460
at least in advertising,

302
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:15,260
the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy in the beholder,

303
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,860
in the service of selling you shit?

304
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,460
But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour,

305
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,900
not something essential to it.

306
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,300
And maybe, glamour would actually be liberated

307
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,700
if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.

308
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,820
So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that,

309
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,580
actually, stuff is good.

310
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,540
Glamour is good.

311
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:33,740
Video games are good.

312
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,780
Luxury is good.

313
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,820
Baths are good.

314
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,940
I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it

315
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,620
horribly.

316
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,100
You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza

317
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,740
is ultimately that the two dollar pizza is actually better.

318
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,300
The golden pizza is an affront,

319
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:50,260
not just to the people whose medical bills it could have paid,

320
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,060
but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.

321
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,260
So I guess my final take here is,

322
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,900
actually, champagne socialism is good.

323
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,820
But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.

324
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,860
I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.

325
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,660
All right.

326
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,700
Now that I've gotten these objections out of the way,

327
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,340
I'm finally ready to get started.

328
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,620
Which you've all been waiting for.

329
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,060
How to end capitalism once and for all.

330
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,660
Well, I don't know.

331
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,060
Who do you people think I am?

332
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,260
I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer,

333
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,180
not transsexual Gandhi.

334
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,380
I mean, according to Marxism,

335
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:24,020
we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.

336
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,540
Capitalism has to fail,

337
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,540
and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.

338
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:32,180
So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.

339
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,020
I'm sure it's bound to happen any day now.

340
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:44,220
You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.

341
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,740
Uh, so, I don't know.

342
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,180
I guess vote Labour.

343
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,780
Tweet radically.

344
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,540
Try to eat more vegetables.

345
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:57,500
Try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people.

346
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:03,300
And can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?

347
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,580
No.

348
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,020
No voting.

349
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,220
Smashing.

350
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,820
Well, you know what?

351
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,660
Since she's the one with the plan, apparently,

352
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,940
I guess just do whatever she says.

353
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,700
Rebel girl!

354
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,420
Rebel girl!

355
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,220
Rebel girl!

356
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,340
Tabby, why don't you go take a bath?

357
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,260
Meow.

358
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,180
Mm.

359
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,220
Good kitty.

360
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,620
Don't close the door!

361
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,540
Dear comrades,

362
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,940
the Central Catgirl Committee has determined that ContraPoints is,

363
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,020
and always has been,

364
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:34,540
counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.

365
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:38,100
The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video

366
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,380
with a tribute to the immortal science of tabia-,

367
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,540
dirt, dirt.

368
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:47,140
No.

369
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:47,940
Noâ

370
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:48,680
No!

371
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,940
22

372
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:49,920
Thank you.

373
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:55,320
Thank you.
