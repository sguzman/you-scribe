1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Imagine how a woman feels. Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels. Imagine the

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,520
sweet smell of her perfume. Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,600
yours. Imagine her letting you get on top of her and insert your p***s inside her,

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:31,660
softly moaning as it slides in. Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm p***s wrapped

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:38,180
around every inch of your c***. Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every

6
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:44,100
thrust. Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as

7
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:51,480
she possibly can and begging you to c*** inside her as you release every ounce of

8
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,580
your c***.

9
00:00:52,600 --> 00:01:00,500
Then imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards and looking

10
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:10,840
beside you to see a person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,940
way possible.

12
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:21,820
You will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in

13
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,580
your face are too small.

14
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,880
You will never get to experience this because you are not the proper shape.

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,880
You will never get to experience this because you are not the proper shape.

16
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
Have a nice day.

17
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Hello boys.

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:27,880
Let's talk about bone structure.

19
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:47,460
There is something basically Soviet about the way the internet names things.

20
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,700
Stalin had portmanteaus like Agitprop, Politburo and Kompromat.

21
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,700
And we have Wevelet.

22
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,460
You know.

23
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:56,780
webinar, podcast, and incel, short for involuntary celibate.

24
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,980
The word incel was invented in the late 90s

25
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,320
by a lonely bisexual called Alana,

26
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,660
who created a website called

27
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,220
Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project

28
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,760
that was essentially a safe space

29
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,420
for people who just couldn't get it in.

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,040
But in our own miserable moment of internet history,

31
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,000
the word incel refers to a more specific community

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,220
of mostly heterosexual men centered around forums

33
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,180
like incel.me and r slash brain cells.

34
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:23,860
This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press

35
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,120
because for the last few years,

36
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,700
they've been churning out mass murderers

37
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,040
faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies.

38
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,080
But most incels aren't violent killers.

39
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,420
They're just men who've formed an identity

40
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,780
around not getting laid.

41
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,860
In this video, I don't want to mock incels

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,680
or lecture them or even sympathize with them.

43
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,700
I just want to understand who they are

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,120
and why they're like this.

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,840
To start with, sometimes the best way

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,700
to understand a person's world is to learn their language.

47
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,120
And the language of the incels,

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,960
well,

49
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:52,700
you'll see.

50
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,160
First base, incelese.

51
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,180
Does it ever bother you that the word women

52
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,620
makes adult females sound just a little bit too human?

53
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,540
Well, incels have a solution to that.

54
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:05,040
They've taken to calling women femoines.

55
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,240
The choice of vocabulary tells us

56
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,640
how incels think of women,

57
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,180
not as sisters or mothers

58
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,960
and certainly not as autonomous people,

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,580
but as a kind of foreign and scrutable object

60
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:19,440
comparable to a natural resource, an optenium,

61
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,820
to which incels believe all men

62
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,440
are entitled and to which they feel

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,140
they have been unjustly denied.

64
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,720
There's a long tradition of nerdy men

65
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,300
talking about women in nerdily misogynistic ways.

66
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,340
I'm reminded of famed rocket scientist

67
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,500
Werner von Braun's remark about female astronauts.

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,940
We are reserving 110 pounds of payload

69
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,940
for recreational equipment.

70
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,680
Which is not to say that alpha males

71
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,920
are less misogynistic than nerds,

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,380
but simply that nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny.

73
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,180
Now, femoid is about as neutral a term as incels have,

74
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,780
for women, and it's only downhill from there.

75
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:57,080
There's the usual standbys, bitches, sluts, whores,

76
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,400
all conveying a searing resentment of female sexuality,

77
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
the pinnacle of which is represented

78
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,260
by the bespoke incel coinage, roasty,

79
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,500
which I'm sorry to inform you,

80
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,100
refers to the incel belief that the human vulva

81
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:11,380
become mutilated through repeated penetration

82
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,200
by different men, though not through repeated penetration

83
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
by the same man, interestingly,

84
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,280
and thereby come to resemble roast beef.

85
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,700
Now, by definition, incels haven't actually observed

86
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,840
any vaginas, but to incels, anatomy is more a matter

87
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,520
of metaphysical speculation than crude science.

88
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,200
Though if you ask me, the right metaphor

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,020
for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour grapes.

90
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
Of course, not all femoids are created equal.

91
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,760
There are various subspecies.

92
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:43,980
The becky, or normie, femoid is to be contrasted

93
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,520
with the stacy, or sexually desirable femoid,

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,700
whose distinguishing features include makeup,

95
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,900
a slightly more masculine look,

96
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,400
a more masculine style of hair,

97
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,060
and a more Improvised look.

98
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,140
Stacy, on point, never works a day in her life.

99
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,820
Naturally curvy body gives men instant erections,

100
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,020
big tits and ass show fertility.

101
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,000
Leave my buns alone, you savages!

102
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,320
The stacy, naturally, has a male counterpart,

103
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,580
whom incels call the chad.

104
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:17,480
A chad is a hunky alpha whose hands are always prepared

105
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,840
to grab nearby fertile pussy.

106
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,100
He has a sloped forehead with a strong brow,

107
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,600
ram-bow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital plate.

108
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,740
It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad

109
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:35,720
exhibiteth a brow-ridge most pronounced,

110
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:41,040
whereas the skull of the Virgin is most inadequate in this regard,

111
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,940
predisposing such specimens to an abject existence of lamentation and cuckoldry.

112
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,020
It's time to talk about bone structure.

113
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,940
According to a classic incel meme,

114
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:58,780
The difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally a few millimeters of bone.

115
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,920
I would like to propose a sociological theory.

116
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,320
Farpington's Law.

117
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,680
Once bigotry or self-loathing permeate a given community,

118
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,220
it is only a matter of time before deep metaphysical significance

119
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,100
is assigned to the shape of human skulls.

120
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,060
Why skulls, you ask?

121
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,920
Well, the best explanation I can come up with

122
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:21,320
is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable.

123
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:25,360
It's therefore the perfect symbol of the intrinsic and permanent characteristics

124
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
that bigots like to assign to certain groups of people.

125
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,720
If you believe, for example, that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior,

126
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,540
you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape of a skull and saying,

127
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,100
Well, that's the reason why.

128
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,300
It's just nature.

129
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,280
There's nothing that can be done about it.

130
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,520
And that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy.

131
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,060
Mankind is divided into two groups of people.

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,940
The chads with the fuckable skulls

133
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,120
and the incels whose bones come up a few millimeters short.

134
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,860
Corndog, anyone?

135
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,940
I'm really hungry.

136
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,940
Of course, it's not just the skulls the incels blame for their sexlessness.

137
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:07,360
They have a whole dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of involuntary celibacy.

138
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:10,080
Height cells are inceled due to their inferior stature,

139
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,240
whereas mental cells can't attract women because of mental illness or autism,

140
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,160
or they're addicts and then called drug cells.

141
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,240
Wrist cells, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists.

142
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,020
Now, obsessing about your wrist size does seem a little weird.

143
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,520
Oh, yeah?

144
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:31,240
Is it a little weird that the average dildo has more girth than my wrist?

145
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,040
Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist?

146
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,580
But yeah, obviously,

147
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:43,160
obsessing about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even many women's is completely irrational body dysmorphia.

148
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:47,200
And the reason why no one wants to be with me or even talk to me is my shitty personality.

149
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:47,800
Even though,

150
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:53,300
literal 80 IQ men who have nothing to talk about except who won the game last night

151
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,000
are still able to attract a loving partner.

152
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,180
Interesting.

153
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,680
A significant number of incels are not white,

154
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,580
in which case their unfuckability is attributed to race,

155
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,460
and they are accordingly termed apologies in advance,

156
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,460
black cells,

157
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,180
rice cells, curry cells, and so on.

158
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,840
Which is not to say that all non-white men are celibate.

159
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,800
There are, of course, the occasional chads of color with their superior skills,

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,600
skulls, and towering stature,

161
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:24,840
whom the incels have christened Tyrones, Changs, and Chadpreets.

162
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,640
I'm so sorry.

163
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,640
So you can be incel because of your looks, your height, your mind, or your race,

164
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,960
but what unites them all is the conviction that love and sex are forever out of reach.

165
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,800
Unless, of course, you delusionally imagine that you can ascend,

166
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,920
that is, escape your inceldom.

167
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:45,380
If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any possibility of improvement,

168
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,680
well, that makes you the lowest of the low.

169
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,260
A sad and sorry hope-cel.

170
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,980
Second base, the red pill.

171
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,520
So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview,

172
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,980
the stacys, the chads, the incels, and the normies.

173
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:05,060
From these elements, incels have constructed a theory of human nature and sexuality,

174
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,140
which they call the red pill.

175
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,440
Incels share the red pill worldview with the rest of the manosphere,

176
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:13,380
that is, pick-up artists, men's rights activists,

177
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,060
and the voluntary celibate community known as Men Going Their Own Way,

178
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,440
abbreviated MGTOW.

179
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:22,100
According to red pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous.

180
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,760
Hypergamy, new Greek for marrying above,

181
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,180
refers to the practice of seeking relationships with men above one's social status,

182
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:32,760
and also, in incel usage, above one's attractiveness.

183
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:38,140
According to incels, physical attractiveness is naturally distributed equally between the sexes.

184
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:43,260
So, if you were to assign numerical ratings to attractiveness, as incels like to do,

185
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,360
there would be about as many, say, 8 out of 10 women, as 8 out of 10 men.

186
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:54,160
Incels believe that in a just world, a 5 out of 10 man would naturally wind up in a relationship with his looks match,

187
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,480
that is, a 5 out of 10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.

188
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women,

189
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:07,160
who, regardless of their own attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad.

190
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,700
Incels sometimes call this the 80-20 rule,

191
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,980
the idea that only the top 20% of men will ever be desired by women.

192
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,900
Now, since most heterosexual men do end up being attracted to men,

193
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,140
you might be raising your eyebrow at that idea.

194
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,140
But incels have an explanation.

195
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:28,480
According to the red pill theory, women often pursue a mating strategy called alpha-fucks-beta-bucks.

196
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,900
This means that in her 20s, a woman will, as incels say,

197
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,700
ride the cock carousel, sleeping with as many chads as possible.

198
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,740
But as she ages into her 30s, she will settle down with a beta-normie whom she's not really attracted to,

199
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,900
but whom she will use for financial support,

200
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,700
all the while continuously cuckolding him on the alpha-cock carousel.

201
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:50,900
Before inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything he's worth in a divorce settlement,

202
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,600
and running off to the Mediterranean with all the children and a new chad boyfriend,

203
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,820
while the beta-cock is left behind to fester in alimony payments, solitude, and poverty.

204
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:04,060
So the upshot of the red pill theory is that for men, there are three possible outcomes.

205
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Either you're an incel, doomed to a lifetime of excruciating loneliness and resentment,

206
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:12,240
or you're a normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife,

207
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,860
who will divorce you, win custody of the children, and run off with all your money.

208
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,980
Or you could be an alpha, an independent, promiscuous man,

209
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,660
who sleeps with lots of women and forms attachments to none of them.

210
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,780
In the red pill philosophy, there are two ways to become alpha.

211
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,480
The first is simply to be a chad by nature.

212
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,900
The second is to become a pickup artist.

213
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,400
Red-pilled pickup artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe,

214
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:42,200
that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable.

215
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,780
The difference is that pickup artists are not celibate.

216
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,900
In fact, they try to have sex with women.

217
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,400
They try to have sex with as many women as possible by following a series of strategies

218
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,920
and scripts known as game, as described by the book of that title, as well as by the

219
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,480
red-pilled pickup artist, Roosh V, author of a book called Bang, a new mascara from

220
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Benefit.

221
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,940
So, the tube is bomb, I am living, let's see what the wand looks like.

222
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,080
Oh.

223
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,080
It's so big.

224
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,680
I wonder what Roosh is up to lately.

225
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,140
I bake my own bread.

226
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,780
Yes, I am outing myself as a baker.

227
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,540
As someone who likes to cook.

228
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,960
I'm not a woman.

229
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:23,980
I am ultra-masculine as you can see, but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing.

230
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,500
And men like scientific things.

231
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,960
I used to be a, a scientist.

232
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Well, Roosh, you know what?

233
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:33,880
If it means you leave women alone, I hope you enjoy your new life as an ultra-masculine

234
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,880
baker.

235
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,780
Sorry, I mean bread scientist.

236
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,020
So remember, the red pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20%

237
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:44,020
or less of men are really attractive to women.

238
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:48,460
Dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism is a pretext for enabling women to behave

239
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:52,420
however they want while consigning men to emasculation and impotence.

240
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:56,260
The black pill is the additional realization that one's place in the sexual marketplace

241
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,620
is genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships are forever

242
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:04,180
out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible, and there's nothing one can

243
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,720
do except lie down and rot.

244
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,700
The black pill is essentially dogmatic hopelessness about dating, and about life in general.

245
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,920
It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call sexism.

246
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,920
It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call sexism.

247
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,660
It's called catastrophizing, a cognitive distortion where anxiety or depression leads

248
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,180
you to infer apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks and anxieties.

249
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:26,800
For instance, a catastrophizing person might begin with the thought, oh no, I'm gonna

250
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,580
be late for work, and from there infer, my boss is gonna be angry, I'm gonna lose

251
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:34,180
my job, I'm not gonna be able to get another job, I'm gonna be unemployed forever, my

252
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,640
family will starve, oh god, we're all gonna die.

253
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,640
Each step in this sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is

254
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,640
completely absurd.

255
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,640
This is exactly how the black pill works.

256
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,800
You start with experiences of rejection and isolation.

257
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:51,160
From there, you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never be attractive

258
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,920
to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy, that women

259
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:58,700
did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the social trends

260
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,180
that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and your only

261
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,680
option is to lie down and rot.

262
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,440
Of course, not all incels take things quite so far, but a lot of them do.

263
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:12,360
On incel forums, suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often tagged suafuel

264
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
or ropefuel.

265
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,220
This is what they make you want to kill yourself, usually because they're reminders of how hopeless

266
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,680
the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that incels are missing out on the incredible

267
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,400
bliss of sex and romance.

268
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,180
Now if you suggest to incels that posting suafuel on forums already populated by lonely

269
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:33,160
and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that oh it's

270
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:37,700
just dark humor, it's just a cope, throw us a bone here, but a lot of the suicidal stuff

271
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,980
shows no signs of humor, and it's common to see people express pretty extreme states of

272
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,800
depression, which is not surprising.

273
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,760
Since hopelessness is the logical conclusion of the black-pill worldview.

274
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,000
One's possibility for happiness is determined by the genetics of height, frame, and facial

275
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
bone structure.

276
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,740
And if you don't have these gifts, there's no relief but to cope or rope.

277
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:59,840
Now it's pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these kids.

278
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,940
You want to grab them by their black ops t-shirts, shake them a bit, and tell them there are

279
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,140
millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they're

280
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:10,600
their own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some

281
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,120
friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows?

282
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,620
Make some money.

283
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:17,400
Maybe they'll develop a disposition that women find a little more approachable.

284
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,740
Essentially, you want to tell them, clean your room, bucko.

285
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,500
In fact, for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of advice,

286
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:27,980
Jordan Peterson is probably helpful, because he's telling them a lot of what they need

287
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,960
to hear, and he's kind of a sexist old man, so they might actually listen.

288
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:34,680
But most incels don't want to hear this kind of advice.

289
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,400
In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression.

290
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:42,260
You are, in effect, chad-splaining their oppression to them, when you give basic advice like take

291
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,120
a shower, be more confident.

292
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:48,660
To people who've already experienced a lifetime of rejection and isolation, and who believe

293
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,260
they've already tried everything.

294
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:55,140
So they despise this kind of advice, and devote endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility

295
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,960
and insensitivity of it.

296
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,640
Just go out to parties, bro.

297
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:02,600
Instead of hating on women all day, why don't you losers just try being confident?

298
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,920
Like this average looking guy.

299
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
Confidence is key.

300
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,860
You incels need some hobbies.

301
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,440
Try reading some books.

302
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Women love intelligence.

303
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,120
It works for me, bro.

304
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
Aw.

305
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
I need to get out.

306
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,880
No one knows what it's like to be hated.

307
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,340
To incels, their worldview seems ironclad, and has built-in defenses against anyone who

308
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,040
would try to change their minds.

309
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,880
So if you want to understand incels, and in particular, if you want to understand why

310
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,700
their community produces so many mass murderers, you have to understand that the black pill

311
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,560
is more than the dogma that you can't get laid.

312
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:41,880
It's also the dogma that because you can't get laid, you can never be happy.

313
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:42,960
So what we have in our hands here is this.

314
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,140
It's not just a bunch of angry internet misogynists.

315
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,780
It's at worst a kind of death cult, complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy.

316
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:56,140
It is not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude that since

317
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,960
triumph is impossible, why not try revenge?

318
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,220
Third base.

319
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,220
Tinder is garbage.

320
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,620
I know I said I wasn't going to sympathize with incels, and I know they don't want my

321
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,960
sympathy anyway, and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil.

322
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,160
But on some level, I can't help it.

323
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:18,200
The internet is for introverts, so I'm sure a lot of people watching this feel the same

324
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,200
way.

325
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,380
I bet some of you have been this guy.

326
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,200
I have been this guy.

327
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,840
So look, I'm going to tell you something I've never really come out about on this channel,

328
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,480
so this is like a really vulnerable moment for me, but I used to live as a man.

329
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,560
And I'm not proud of that, but I'm ready to move on if you're ready to forgive.

330
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:41,240
I'm in the unusual situation of being a woman who dates men who used to be a man who dates women.

331
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,720
What kind of fucked up shit is that?

332
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,140
Is that even allowed?

333
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:49,020
Alright, cop down lesbian stans, I'm still attracted to women.

334
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,640
And those who lieth betwixt.

335
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,640
Cats.

336
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,640
The inherent eroticism of the sea.

337
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Mmm, yeah.

338
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Don't you just want to get in there?

339
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,320
Take me, mommy.

340
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,200
But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately.

341
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,780
I gotta get my hetero on.

342
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,200
What I'm getting at is I've used Tinder both as a man seeking women and as a woman seeking

343
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,200
men.

344
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,380
And that gives me some relevant experiences.

345
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,380
When you're a man, the strategy is you've gotta send a lot of messages, because women

346
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:23,000
get a lot of messages, and then you just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys.

347
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,220
Whereas if you're a woman, you get to lie recumbent on your chaise longue and receive

348
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,220
the inquiries.

349
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,440
Let's see how we're doing here.

350
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,760
How many men have liked me on Tinder?

351
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm paying $30 for this information, so this better be good.

352
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
I have 2,500 likes.

353
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
That's a lot of Baltimore.

354
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
That's a lot of Baltimore.

355
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,900
That's a lot of Baltimore-ian men who swiped right on a tran.

356
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,900
What a divine city.

357
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:53,160
Oh, that's so nice of them to be interested in me.

358
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,100
Let's see what kind of messages I got.

359
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,440
Dick or no dick?

360
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,280
Pre-op or post-op?

361
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,700
Did you cut your dick off?

362
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,260
Oh my god.

363
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,880
I'm gonna cut it off, okay?

364
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,880
Jesus.

365
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:09,140
I will let you smash my pussy so, so hard if you just be patient.

366
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:10,140
It's a whole process.

367
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
That's not a pussy.

368
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,880
That's a fuckhole.

369
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,880
You'll never know what it's like to squeeze life out of your sacred passage.

370
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:16,880
Well, that's true.

371
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,940
I'm not gonna be squeezing any life out unless something goes very seriously wrong, and I

372
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,160
assure you that none of the passages I have down there have ever been or ever will be

373
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
sacred.

374
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,160
Abigail, leave my fuckhole out of this.

375
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,880
When I first started using this app, I was messaging with a guy who seemed super chill.

376
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:35,880
He was gonna take me to a concert.

377
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
I was like, it seems like a lot for a first date, but we'll try it.

378
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,880
He was like, you know what?

379
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,880
I don't know.

380
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,880
I don't know.

381
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:41,320
I'm gonna try it.

382
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,720
Fifteen minutes after we agreed to that, he sends me a message.

383
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,580
What color panties are you wearing?

384
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:53,100
I would love to smell them.

385
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,100
Can we get coffee first?

386
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:58,640
The hell of it is, I probably would've let him smell my panties, but this is the thing

387
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,020
you bring up on the third fuck.

388
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,000
You don't open with panty sniffing.

389
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,320
Like, the only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you're gonna murder

390
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,320
me.

391
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,320
And you're already fucking it up.

392
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,880
So this is the experience of women on Tinder.

393
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,700
we're drowning in dick and most of it is terrible not all i do have some very sweet messages and i

394
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,780
haven't been using the app in a couple months so if i didn't respond to you or if we didn't match

395
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:25,200
it's not because i rejected you it's because i don't like the app people screenshot my profile

396
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:30,560
and they post it online and they call me contra points and like i'm just too famous for this shit

397
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:36,380
my life is hard so girls we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad

398
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,220
dicks that's constantly pointed at us in dating apps but how would you feel if instead of that

399
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:46,320
you were just getting radio silence like the incels get i can't speak for other women but

400
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:52,880
personally i prefer the firing squad of dicks you know at least these pricks care enough about my

401
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:58,600
pussy to be an asshole about my dick i feel sorry for men on dating apps i really do you have to

402
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,620
deal with a lot of rejection and that must be difficult these apps are especially brutal to

403
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,360
people who aren't photogenic if you're meeting people at a bar or a party you might strike

404
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,300
up a conversation with someone who you're not initially physically attracted to but then

405
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:14,900
maybe they're super funny or charming or maybe they're attracted to me and that's an attractive

406
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:20,740
quality in another person that they appreciate how beautiful i am but on tinder you're just

407
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,980
browsing a catalog of faces and gatekeeping who even gets to talk to you in the first place

408
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:30,820
red pillars have a really gross way of talking about dating in terms of sexual market value

409
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:36,340
but like dating kind of is a marketplace or at least you can analyze it like one and our culture

410
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:41,720
is so visual and these apps are so picture centered that bone structure like it's not the

411
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,240
only thing that matters but it matters a great deal and this is where i do have sympathy for

412
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,600
the incels because as a trans woman i know what it's like to obsess over millimeters of bone

413
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:56,020
i actually had to interrupt work on this video to go to a consultation for facial feminization

414
00:21:56,020 --> 00:22:01,100
surgery so i can pay luxury car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters of bone here and

415
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,120
there because it must needs be remarked that the skull of the female exhibited

416
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:11,060
a brow ridge less pronounced i mean i'm just as obsessed with bone structure as the goddamn

417
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:15,620
men cells because i think certain parts of my face make me look like a man and i worry about

418
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:20,580
it every day we're all obsessed with the bones honey we all have bones inside us we all love

419
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,980
touching bones you want to take a measurement from the supraorbital ridge to the lambdoid suture

420
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:34,660
and multiply that figure by pi to calculate what we call the chat circumference

421
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,200
why is no one talking to me?

422
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,180
why is no one talking about the chad circumference?

423
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:44,900
fourth base just the tip there's another way i think my experience as a trans woman is relevant

424
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,940
to the incel discussion and that's that i recognize delusional self-loathing when i see it

425
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:54,820
i'm far from the first to point out that the supreme gentleman incel mass murderer elliot

426
00:22:54,820 --> 00:23:00,820
roger was apart from his narcissistic psychopath personality an eminently bangable twink i'm not

427
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,700
going to show you pictures of incels but on their forums they do sometimes post selfie threads

428
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:12,260
and you can't say this on incel forums without enraging them but in confidence from one pretend

429
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:18,420
clinician to another let me tell you that the truth about incels is that almost all of them

430
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:23,300
are completely normal looking guys but of course that's not the feedback they get from other incels

431
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:26,900
the feedback they get is that their chins are weak their hair is thin their skin is

432
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,740
garbage and there's no hope whatsoever no woman will ever love them and there are

433
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:35,540
true cells with no option but to lie down and rot and the interesting thing is those guys pose for

434
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:41,860
selfies to those threads knowing that's the kind of feedback they're gonna get so why why do they

435
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:47,780
do it well i'll tell you a little story there is a website on the internet called 4chan.org

436
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:53,780
that has a board called lgbt a few years ago this was used mainly by the 25 gay men who

437
00:23:53,780 --> 00:24:01,460
actually like milo yiannopoulos but recently it's used mostly by men who are entertaining

438
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,380
the notion of becoming women and by early transition trans women

439
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:11,860
the board is jokingly called tttt now i've recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition

440
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:18,900
but the memory is still fresh and let me tell you it is a painful awkward humiliating stage of life

441
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:24,580
so the trans women of tttt are tragic they're basically still in man mode which is why they're

442
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,980
using 4chan and i bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels for incels the core

443
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:35,520
frustration is that they can't get laid for tttt it's that they can't get laid they can't get laid

444
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,620
they can't pass as female both groups post selfies knowing they're going to get brutal

445
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,100
unconstructive feedback and both groups have a weird vocabulary with which to express their

446
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:51,460
anxieties for instance on tttt a major piece of jargon is hun a slur used by trans women

447
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:56,100
for other trans women which basically means that you look like a man in a dress

448
00:24:56,100 --> 00:25:00,580
which is what every trans woman is afraid of and there's another commonality with incels too

449
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,500
with all bigots and self-loathers which if you've been paying attention

450
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:05,460
you've already seen it

451
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,180
already guessed

452
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,940
you will never be seen as a woman because of your head size

453
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:14,500
have all the surgeries in the world your massive man noggin will stay the same

454
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:20,980
lel this freak thinks he has very soft facial features his head is huge lel

455
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,140
and the huns on reddit are hug boxing him and telling him that there are women with big heads

456
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:31,060
uh no there aren't there aren't women with heads that do that and ffs won't change you might

457
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:35,060
as well repress you transition with a man's head you will be clocked you will be looked at as a

458
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:35,460
freak

459
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,780
will never be seen as a woman

460
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,420
100%

461
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,220
this is why i'm not transitioning

462
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:48,660
thank you skull people for showing me the way and that no matter what i do i will always be

463
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:54,980
a manly man skull wise you saved me the embarrassment of being a literal

464
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,340
big-headed man in the dress

465
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:03,060
it is evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile be much more voluminous and the

466
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,540
facial plane wider be one with you at last rights do i hold a war Joanna uso what the real Amy wrote

467
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:04,980
was that fade worse visible I liked erasными man as a female. guten like that man wouldn't crack up.

468
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,260
It always comes back to the skulls. Every time.

469
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:13,140
The other interesting thing about TTTT is I used to get posted there a lot.

470
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:17,540
For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed me as inspiration.

471
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:21,220
Yikes. Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon.

472
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,380
If I'm not looked at as a big skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well,

473
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,980
that means that some of their transitions might go well too.

474
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:36,660
And that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing and hopelessness.

475
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,180
So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain why I didn't pass,

476
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,220
why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me

477
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,900
shouldn't even fucking think about it.

478
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,540
They shouldn't transition at all. They should just repress.

479
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,140
They should lie down and rot.

480
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,740
And I used to read this stuff all the time.

481
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,460
Like, I would specifically seek out threads about me.

482
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:59,540
Which might seem strange, considering I had hundreds of fans telling me I was a gorgeous

483
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,500
goddess every day.

484
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:00,980
So,

485
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,660
why did I turn away from that?

486
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:07,940
To intentionally seek out this dismal den of Huns talking about how my giant Hun skull is

487
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:13,380
clockable at a thousand paces and my voice sounds like a ridiculous Muppet falsetto hybrid

488
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,380
of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.

489
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:19,780
Well, basically there was part of my brain that just simply refused to believe it when

490
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,540
people told me I was gorgeous.

491
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:24,100
And for semi-plausible reasons.

492
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,260
A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous no matter

493
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,220
what they look like.

494
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,660
That's where the word Hun

495
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,460
comes from.

496
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,500
You look great, Hun.

497
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:38,900
So what TTTT is saying about Reddit hugboxing is true to some extent.

498
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:44,740
There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces.

499
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:48,260
So I came to regard all compliments as everyone is beautiful.

500
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,940
Politically correct cuckoldry.

501
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:54,740
And there would be this thrill of going to TTTT and reading other people saying what

502
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,540
my deepest anxieties told me was really true.

503
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,340
And that was always painful, but there was a kind of

504
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,540
pleasure, too.

505
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,660
There was a rush.

506
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,540
It's exciting.

507
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:06,820
To burst out of the politically correct bubble and say what you're really thinking.

508
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:10,340
That personality doesn't matter because big skulled chads get all the girls.

509
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:14,180
That ContraPoints is a big skulled Hun with a voice like nails on a shockboard.

510
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:18,500
And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I was just doing research.

511
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,740
I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying.

512
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,500
It's simply my job.

513
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,820
But soon I realized it wasn't just research.

514
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,900
And it was infecting me away from the computer.

515
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,980
This ridiculous vocabulary.

516
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:29,780
Huns.

517
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,820
AGP.

518
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,460
It was popping up in my head at unexpected times.

519
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:35,860
It was starting to color how I thought about myself.

520
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:40,020
And worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other trans women.

521
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:43,460
And that's the moment I realized, I need to stop looking at this stuff right now or

522
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,980
I'm going to become a monster.

523
00:28:44,980 --> 00:28:47,700
And once that happens, it's going to be very difficult to fix.

524
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,100
This is exactly how the incel black pill works.

525
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
There's something infectious about these vocabularies.

526
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:57,220
Like on days I've been working on this video, I'll go out at night and these words just

527
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,460
involuntarily show up in my thoughts.

528
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,300
That bartender is such a chad.

529
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,380
He's totally hype-mocking that tiny cock.

530
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:07,300
And the tragic thing is, some incels don't realize what this is doing to their minds

531
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,500
until it's too late.

532
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,380
Let's face it.

533
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:12,260
Black pills are suey fuel.

534
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,580
And a lot of us can't handle them.

535
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:19,060
I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it since I loved uncovering

536
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,940
secrets that society had been hiding from me.

537
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:27,380
But it has affected my mental health in a bad way.

538
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,500
I made my

539
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:34,100
first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago, and I've never needed to do that before.

540
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,940
I could always talk myself out of it through logic, but my mind is ruined now.

541
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,500
This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm,

542
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:48,740
prototypically teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock puppet accounts.

543
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:53,380
But the more sophisticated adult version of this involves intentionally seeking out abusive and

544
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,340
disparaging comments about yourself made by other people.

545
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,340
I have a long history of doing this.

546
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,500
Intentionally looking for abusive comments.

547
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,820
Especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears.

548
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:05,700
Why?

549
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,900
I don't know.

550
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,660
Why do people cut themselves?

551
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,500
Part of it is what we could call masochistic epistemology.

552
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,260
Whatever hurts is true.

553
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,420
I've recently gotten much better about this.

554
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:21,220
I haven't been to any of the worse places in a couple months, and my mental health is

555
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,260
much improved.

556
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:26,500
So incels, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position

557
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,780
worthy of rational debate.

558
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:28,200
Because these are the same people who have been there for longer than I have done.

559
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:28,300
So, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position worthy of rational debate. Because these are the same people who have been there for longer than I have done.

560
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,580
ideas and arguments, you're not using them the way rational people use arguments. You're

561
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,620
using them as razorblades to abuse yourselves. And I know, because I've done the exact

562
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:41,980
same thing. The incel worldview is catastrophizing. It's an anxious death spiral. And the solution

563
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,700
to that has to be therapeutic, not logical. A lot of you are lonely. You've been bullied

564
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:50,780
and neglected. You feel left behind by society. But what you're doing when you're reading

565
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:56,300
incel forums is you're slowly internalizing a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves

566
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,400
and at other people in your situation, and at women, and you're forming mental habits

567
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,800
that are going to make it very difficult for you to live a happy life. So what you have

568
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,820
to do is get off those forums as fast as possible. I'm going to post a link in the description

569
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:13,800
of this video to instructions on how to block certain websites from your computer, because

570
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,540
for me, that's what it took.

571
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,380
Fifth base. Anal.

572
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:26,300
So the incel reddit transgender 4chan analogy has a limit, and that limit is that

573
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:32,460
for a significant subset of the incel community, their primary hatred is not directed at themselves,

574
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,460
but at women. And they really hate women. Like, I'm basically a professional internet bigotry

575
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:42,540
scholar at this point, I look at this kind of stuff all the time, but researching this video,

576
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,340
I was honestly kinda shocked at the intensity of misogyny on incel forums.

577
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,860
I won't show the worst of it, but we're talking blaming women for rape,

578
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,820
saying they deserve to be raped, calls for state mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but,

579
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,700
most of all, just a kind of generalized, misinformed rage.

580
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,380
I hate women. I really do.

581
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:10,540
Every time I look at them, my blood pressure shoots through the roof, when they're gabbing

582
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:16,700
on the cell phone about Paris Hilton, when they're adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time

583
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,340
rifling through their stupid purse, when they whine to me about their period,

584
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:26,220
when they blither on and on about some artist, film director, musician, nobody gives a-

585
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:32,300
flipping fuck about when they cry and expect your personal sympathy but most of all i hate them

586
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:40,380
because they're smug hyperactive little bitches made that way by our shithole society look what

587
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:46,060
uncontrolled feminism and the media has hi stacy it's tracy well i was at the mall the other day

588
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:52,460
with amber heather jenna and trish and we were talking about paris hilton a very relevant

589
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:57,260
cultural figure in 2018 they live in this cartoon caricature world where it's easy to avoid thinking

590
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,660
of women as fully human and that's where my sympathy runs dry because this kind of hatred

591
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:06,940
just needs a spark to turn to violence so insults i know you're not gonna listen to anything i say

592
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,140
and you're just gonna say that i'm a tranny and a faggot and a degenerate and to that i say how dare

593
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:16,620
you say things that are entirely true but also vol sell if you wouldn't and i know you don't

594
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:21,020
listen to suggestions about how you probably actually could have healthy relationships so

595
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:22,380
no one can really reach you until

596
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:26,620
you get out of those forums and allow yourselves to be reached but by way of a closing remark i

597
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:31,260
guess i simply invite you to consider that you don't even need a warm body or a sex robot to

598
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:37,500
satisfy the erotic longing you know when i was your age in 1975 every teenage boy had a stratocaster

599
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:43,500
in his bedroom it was the outlet for his sexual frustration what i'm suggesting is the manosphere

600
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,940
exists because rock and roll is dead but there's other options think about the eroticism of a

601
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:52,060
rainstorm the clap of thunder

602
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:59,100
the rustle of the leaves the steam rising off the warm pavement

603
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:12,460
and whether you're a chad a stacy an incel or a hun you can always return to the caress of

604
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:22,060
our dark mother the sea whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body

605
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:48,800
as a

606
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,560
of

607
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,460
my

608
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,260
own

609
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,280
work

610
00:34:52,460 --> 00:35:03,400
Whew, is it hot in here or is it just me?
