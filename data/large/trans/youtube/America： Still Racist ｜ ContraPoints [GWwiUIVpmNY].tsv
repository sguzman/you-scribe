0	5680	If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you do.
5680	11360	You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with toad venom,
11360	15920	and you simply wait for the wolverines to eat your legs.
17040	21200	Trust me, you're better off that way. Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race,
21200	25280	well, here's what you get. You get fascism, racist pseudoscience,
25280	30960	racist debate fascists, tag team title match tonight at 9, or if you're lucky, you get this.
30960	35200	So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy-nilly convicting innocent black people of
35200	39840	crimes they didn't commit. Perhaps individuals who happen to be black are making bad choices
39840	44480	for which they have to deal with the consequences. Racism isn't the explanation for everything bad
44480	47680	that happens to black people. If blacks are getting shot and going to jail more,
47680	51680	it's their fault for committing crimes. That's right. Racial inequality in America
51680	55200	exists because black people simply decide to commit more crimes for
55200	55260	now. That's right. Racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide to commit more crimes for now.
55260	60320	I guess he's probably going to blame the rap music. Or deadbeat dads with their sagging pants.
60320	64120	I'd say that this is the most common right-wing view of race in America. It's not outright
64120	69080	fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that racial inequality is the product
69080	74760	not of injustice, but of… black people simply deciding to make bad choices. Usually this idea
74760	78840	gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial inequality and
78840	81880	dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.
81880	85180	Mmm, they make me uncomfortable and I don't like it. This is what I'm going to
85180	89260	argue against in this video. We're going to take a break from talking about fascism. In the past,
89260	93740	I've focused too much on the alt-right. I think we all have. I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely
93740	97900	is a dangerous movement, but it's just not the most consequential kind of white supremacy that
97900	102140	exists in America. In this video, I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America,
102140	105260	which is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.
105260	109660	And from now on, I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow of Pepes and
109660	115100	racist Odinists and neo-Nazi LARPers. All that stuff, it's very last season. I'm kind of
115100	120620	over it. Oh, God damn it. Hello, people. Fritz, get the hell out of here. No one cares about you
120620	126860	anymore. Nein, ich heiße nicht mehr Fritz. Nenn mich jetzt Freya. What? Ich bin jetzt eine Frau.
126860	132220	Great. Get out. Well, don't you want to hear about my transition? No, I don't care. No one cares.
132220	137420	You're still a Nazi. Get out. But I'm trans. How could I possibly be a Nazi? That's a good
137420	141500	question. It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense.
141500	145020	Get out. She calls me a Nazi, and yet she's the one trying to silence
145100	150220	my free speech, an excellent example of how truly fascist the left has become. Look,
150220	153900	if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny, why aren't you willing to discuss them in the free
153900	157740	marketplace of ideas? Well, I'm going to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as
157740	162300	you get out of my room. Mom, get out of my life. Well, can we at least talk about the Jewish
162300	167500	question? No. It's just ideas. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the
167500	171900	tabby whistle if you don't get out of here in ten seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. Oh,
171900	174780	baby, come on. I thought you liked to bake. You used to whisper in my ear. I'm afraid that I'm
174780	178540	going to have to whisper it to me so sweetly. Well, not anymore. Well, do you at least want
178540	187900	to buy some Vitalimax? Hey, Jesus. I don't like doing this. I prefer to have conversations about
187900	192380	disagreements. I don't enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat, but it's these people,
192380	197020	they just give you no choice. Where were we? Right, so racial injustice. When I talk to people
197020	201820	about this issue, they often claim to have this experience that leftists react to them in two ways.
201820	206620	One, by saying, you're racist. And two, by saying, it's not my job to educate you. And I'm
206620	210700	sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience a lot
210700	214460	of people have. And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this,
214460	219740	no offense. And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are
219740	225660	more than happy to educate people in their own special way. So as I see it, the left needs to
225660	229820	step it up. Now, to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on Twitter to demand they
229820	230920	explain racism to you, you're being called a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're
230920	231020	a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're
231020	232060	a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're being kind of
232060	236460	an asshole. And it's true. It's not their job to explain it to you. They have other shit to do
236460	241340	with their lives. But I, on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out
241340	245980	of my lane and white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes. Because it kind of is my job,
245980	250460	and I have all the time in the world. It's a funny thing, time.
251580	256620	Whose job is it to mend the crimes of history? Do we have to take responsibility for things
256620	260120	that happened a long time ago? I don't even take responsibility for things I didn't do.
260120	267860	July. This person. Who the fuck is that? No, I don't have any white guilt. That's not what this
267860	272260	is about. That's just more white narcissism is what that is. So wipe away those white-ass tears.
272260	274660	Here. I'll pick you out a cotton ball.
285380	287020	1. Freddie Gray
287020	290100	On April 12, 2015, three police officers,
290100	295160	near a housing project in West Baltimore, arrested a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray
295160	300160	because he was carrying a spring-assisted knife that maybe was illegal? They handcuffed him and
300160	304520	loaded him into a police van. His leg broke and y'all dragging him like that.
304520	308840	When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason, with three
308840	314240	fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck. A week later, Gray died of his spinal
314240	318040	injury while the Baltimore police released contradictory and inadequate information about
318040	319280	his arrest. This led to widespread protests, and the police were forced to arrest him. This led to
319280	320080	widespread protests, and the police were forced to arrest him. This led to widespread protests,
320080	323760	all over the city, eventually culminating in the notorious Baltimore riots.
323760	327440	Now you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism? If black people don't want to be
327440	331440	killed, then they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from the police. Well, the first problem with
331440	336240	that is that extrajudicial executions for non-violent crimes shouldn't really be a common
336240	340720	thing in a civilized democracy. And it's a little alarming to me how quick you are to defend this.
340720	344640	And the other problem is that that's a very superficial analysis that refuses to examine
344640	349520	the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more poverty, more crime, and are subject to
349520	349600	more aggressive violence than black neighborhoods. And the other problem is that that's a very
349600	350080	superficial analysis that refuses to examine the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more
350080	354080	of policing. So let's delve a little deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study.
354080	358640	Gray had a long arrest record of mostly drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators
358640	364560	brought this out as evidence that he was no angel. The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got
364560	368800	what was coming to him, that he deserved to die. But why did he commit all these crimes in the
368800	373840	first place? I don't think he was selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition. Did he just
373840	379600	do it for no reason? Well, let's see. Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood,
379600	383440	Sandtown, Winchester. You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in
383440	388480	a dilapidated row house with peeling lead paint. Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint
388480	393680	until Congress banned it in 1978 because it causes serious cognitive damage in children,
393680	398000	leading to deficits in attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned
398000	402880	with lead are seven times more likely to drop out of school, and six times more likely to end up in
402880	407920	the juvenile justice system. But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with
407920	409040	the Congressional ban on lead paint. And that's not the only reason why Freddie Gray has been
409040	413520	banned from using lead paint. And as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been
413520	418160	added to Maryland's lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children are black.
418160	422960	Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent brain
422960	427520	damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids. Now, you might be thinking, well, reparations were
427520	433360	paid out, so problem solved, right? Well, unfortunately, no. What's happened is a sub-industry
433360	438000	has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead poisoning victims, some of whom can't even
439040	442880	believe it, and offer to buy out their structured monthly settlements in exchange for a lump sum
442880	446400	that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement. And that's exactly what happened
446400	453040	to Freddie Gray. In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his
453040	460560	settlement for $18,300. They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000
460560	466800	Gray siblings settlement for $54,000. Now, I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad,
466800	469020	but to understand how it relates to structural racism, I'm going to give you a little bit of a
469020	474060	look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation. Or, you know, we could just keep doing livestreams
474060	479260	with Richard Spencer. Interviews with Nazis. The new YouTube craze. God damn it. I need to relax.
479260	480060	I need music.
486860	488700	2. Housing Discrimination
488700	492940	Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated lead
492940	498140	levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.
498140	499000	Yellow dots stand out.
499020	499980	Standing for black residents.
499980	501340	And blue dots standing for white.
501900	503180	Lead. Race.
503820	505340	Lead. Race.
505340	509100	Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.
509100	512460	Why, in the 21st century, is Baltimore still so segregated?
512460	514780	I thought racism was over.
514780	519900	Well, here's the thing about that. When your country's history is 400 years of slavery,
519900	523260	Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't just get to say,
523260	526540	Oops. Sorry about that.
526540	528540	It's all cool now though, right?
528540	528940	No.
529020	530220	It's not cool.
530220	534060	And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not cool things.
534060	536460	Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place.
536460	539980	I hope I'm not being too controversial if I propose that, 100 years ago,
540700	542940	America may have been somewhat racist.
542940	548460	In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious
548460	552780	white Baltimore neighborhood. This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city
552780	557980	passed an ordinance mandating the segregation of every residential block. Basically, the ordinance
557980	562700	forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks, and vice versa,
562700	566060	until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.
566060	569260	Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem?
569260	572700	Racism can't exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.
572700	574220	Well, no.
574220	575980	That's actually not correct.
575980	580540	In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote homeownership in the
580540	583340	midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed.
583340	587820	One of the FHA's purposes was to establish a reliable credit system backed by the government,
587820	590860	which would regulate interest rates and ensure the terms of mortgages.
590860	594940	FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating homeownership throughout the
594940	598860	middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now remember as the golden
598860	602780	age of the American Dream. But many black Americans were excluded from homeownership
602780	607340	and the benefits it conferred to white families, particularly the family financial stability it
607340	612460	enabled. So how was this exclusion possible? Well, basically, the FHA, city governments,
612460	617180	and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle methods to enforce residential segregation and
617180	619980	deny homeownership to black Americans. For instance,
619980	621740	1. Restrictive covenants
621740	625740	When the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official
625740	630140	Committee on Segregation, which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure
630140	634060	landlords in white neighborhoods to sign covenants committing them never to sell or
634060	638220	rent to black residents. These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health
638220	642620	code citations issued against owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the
642620	643260	covenant.
643260	644540	2. Redlining
644540	647020	The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to
647020	651100	insure mortgages in black neighborhoods, which were colored in red on official maps,
651100	655660	giving the practice the name redlining. This effectively denied black citizens access to
655660	659180	government-backed mortgages, which, in turn, left them vulnerable to
659180	660860	3. Predatory lending
660860	665820	Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed mortgages,
665820	669580	exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly-priced installment plans with
669580	674220	abusive terms, which allowed, for instance, sellers to repossess and resell homes after
674220	677020	a single missed payment. Many black residents had no choice,
677020	681180	but to buy into these exploitative contracts, and they often resorted to subdividing houses
681180	685260	or neglecting repairs in order to make payments, further contributing to the overcrowding and
685260	686780	decay of black neighborhoods.
686780	688300	4. Blockbusting
688300	691980	Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting,
691980	696220	where they'd intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among residents of
696220	700620	a white neighborhood. They would then exploit the fear that they created to trick white homeowners
700620	705180	into selling their houses at below market prices, so they could resell those same houses at
705180	706860	extortionate prices to black families. The FHA used this scheme to avoid the risk of black
706860	710620	families desperate to escape the ghetto. The long-term effect of these practices was that
710620	714700	many black families ended up trapped in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools,
714700	719580	little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty, and aggressive, discriminatory policing.
719580	722380	And even though most of these segregation practices have ended,
722380	727020	the injustice remains unredressed. No reparations have been paid to black families who were
727020	731100	effectively robbed of homeownership during this period, predatory lending having cost
731100	736780	black families an estimated $500 million in Chicago alone. But worst of all is that segregation
736860	741100	and ghettoization caused by government-backed discrimination of the last century is still
741100	746460	ongoing. I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fucking neighborhood like one mile away from
746460	750140	where Freddie Gray was arrested in a neighborhood that's like a whole different country.
750140	756380	Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore. Now compare that to the 2013 population by race map.
756380	761500	If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is, and if the city still follows the same
761500	766780	pattern of segregation today, and it does, well, it's almost as if the effects of
766780	771900	racism have not entirely been eradicated. And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.
771900	777580	Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans,
777580	781740	Cleveland, LA. All these cities are still segregated as shit, and it's not like a
781740	786860	separate but equal situation either. Compare the 2013 population by race map of Baltimore
786860	791660	to this map of Baltimore police stops between 2010 and 2015. That's black neighborhoods in red
791660	796060	and green dots representing recorded police stops of black pedestrians. And finally, let's bring
796060	801260	back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013. Now consider this information in
801260	806060	combination with some scientific studies linking lead exposure and violent crime, and it almost
806060	810620	starts to look like there's some problems going on here that might not be solved simply by telling
810620	814940	black teenagers to tighten their belts and do less crimes. But I don't want to overstate the lead
814940	819020	crime theory either, because that only accounts for a small fraction of what's going on here.
819020	823020	The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation,
823020	825980	the historical exclusion from homeownership, the lost upper
826060	830700	opportunities, the bad schools, and this country's ongoing insistence on treating a problem of
830700	834780	injustice as if it were simply a problem of criminality. I know I said my interest in this
834780	840460	topic isn't a matter of white guilt, and it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?
842380	848300	In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt. You're not
848300	854460	responsible for what your great-grandparents did. As you ease the tension in each muscle group,
854460	856060	exhale deeply, and repeat,
856060	860060	the mantra, black lives matter are the real racists.
862780	864700	3. Mass Incarceration
864700	869980	Since the 1970s, the United States' incarceration rate has rapidly risen to the point where nearly
869980	875020	1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison. We now have the highest incarceration rate in the
875020	880540	world, accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's
880540	884620	population. More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black, and the black
884620	885500	incarceration rate is almost 2.5% of the world's population. This is the highest incarceration rate
885500	885580	in the world, accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's
885580	886300	prisoners, though we make up only 4.5% of the world's prisoners. This is the highest incarceration rate
886300	887340	in the world's prison rate.
887340	891660	Now, without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in general.
891660	896060	Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison, too many defendants are
896060	900140	pressured into plea bargains, and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of
900140	904300	incarceration. But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.
904300	907180	Now, a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,
907180	910220	if the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.
910220	912140	Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.
912140	915340	You know what, why don't we all interview Richard Spencer? Every single YouTuber,
915340	919580	free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda. Let's get them
919580	924300	all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream, and then we can finally give the
924300	928620	Jewish question the platform it deserves. God damn it, where's my toad venom?
928620	932140	Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit
932140	936300	more crimes. For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate, but black people
936300	940380	are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it. And we're talking about a drug that,
940380	945260	at this point, white America has basically decided shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.
945340	949820	So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry, and just look what white people are
949820	956620	doing to weed. Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a ganjapreneur. It's a strong, strong sativa,
956620	961100	very high in limonene. It's a great bronchodilator, so I like to use it when I work out.
961100	964220	Yeah, so, in fact, in the back of the limousine is only the,
964220	966540	one of the only legal places you can consume cannabis.
967260	971340	The whites are at it again. They have gentrified the marijuana. And now we've got white business
971340	975180	people making millions of dollars selling the same drug that black people are still
975180	977660	disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.
977660	978780	A ganjapreneur!
978780	980460	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
980460	985180	This is the most basic kind of unfairness. And if this doesn't make you angry, then either you're
985180	990620	really ignorant about this, or you might just not care about black people.
990620	994700	I don't like to assume the worst of people, but when I look at the state of the conversation about
994700	999820	race in America, I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial
999820	1003740	executions of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,
1003740	1007180	and the vicious history of discrimination and its ongoing repercussions.
1007180	1011980	And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person who
1011980	1015580	takes a stand, or takes a knee, or speaks up about this in any way.
1015580	1020380	There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter is,
1020380	1023900	and how it's identity politics equivalent to white nationalism,
1023900	1027020	and it's unpatriotic, and postmodern, and racist.
1027020	1030300	And I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.
1030300	1033660	Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's night
1033660	1037180	mare. If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare,
1037180	1040300	it's locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.
1040300	1043740	But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to
1043740	1049340	talk about that. They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest.
1049340	1050300	How dare they?
1050300	1055020	Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists or stock
1055020	1059100	salad-eating basic white girl caricatures. I imagine some black people will probably watch
1059100	1062860	this video and think, where does this white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim? I take
1062860	1066380	responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.
1066380	1070300	And here's the thing about that. You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility,
1070300	1073420	or taking control of your life to the greatest extent possible,
1073420	1076140	is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.
1076140	1079260	So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.
1079260	1081660	Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.
1081660	1085660	So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallowing victimhood.
1085660	1088380	Please don't do that. Go succeed as much as possible.
1088380	1092380	But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.
1092380	1096220	Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances,
1096220	1100300	but we also have a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions
1100300	1102620	that create those circumstances in the first place.
1103660	1106540	Wow. I feel like I just gave a great speech.
1106540	1110220	Would you take my speech less seriously if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light
1110220	1112460	Lime this entire time? Look, I even put a lime in it.
1112460	1116620	Bud Light Lime with Lime. The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain
1116620	1122140	too much about people who complain too much about racism. For the final countdown.
1122140	1124620	I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.
1124620	1128780	First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white people.
1128780	1132060	I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.
1132060	1134460	But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country,
1134460	1136380	and someone should make videos about those too.
1136380	1139020	Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.
1139020	1142860	I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the topic.
1142860	1146380	Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.
1146380	1148620	Like, come on, that should just be common sense.
1148620	1151820	So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down,
1151820	1153740	smash that unsubscribe button,
1153740	1157740	unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos,
1157740	1161980	and then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have to say.
1161980	1165580	Um, so, I guess that's it.
1165580	1167020	I was just kidding about the forest.
1167020	1169820	I don't fuck with forests, I'm really more of an indoor tranny.
1169820	1176060	So, guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.
1176860	1181740	My eyes have seen the glory of the coming day
1181820	1184540	The King of the Lord
1184540	1188540	He is trampling out the vintage
1188540	1192620	Where the graves of wrath are stoned
1192620	1196700	He hath loosed the fateful lightning
1196700	1200380	Of his terrible swift sword
1200380	1207420	His truth is marching on
1207420	1211260	Glory, glory, hallelujah!
1211820	1216460	Glory, glory, hallelujah!
1216460	1220460	Glory, glory, hallelujah!
1220460	1225180	His truth is marching on!
1225180	1227580	In the beauty of the lilies
1227580	1230140	Christ was born across the sea
1230140	1232700	With a glory in his bosom
1232700	1235260	That transfigures you and me
1235260	1237740	As he died to make men holy
1237740	1240460	Let us die to make men free
1240460	1241580	While God is with us
1241580	1246220	God is marching on!
1246220	1250540	Glory, glory, hallelujah!
1250540	1254860	Glory, glory, hallelujah!
1254860	1258860	Glory, glory, hallelujah!
1258860	1264300	His truth is marching on!
1264300	1265900	Death to capitalism and the patriarchy
1265900	1266700	Smash the binary
1266700	1267740	Hail Satan!
1267740	1270940	Ow!
