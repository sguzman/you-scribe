00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
My face is the front of shop

00:07.000 --> 00:09.000
My face is the real shop front

00:11.000 --> 00:13.000
My shop is the fake side front

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
I'm real when I shop my face

00:30.000 --> 00:50.000
Hey guys, it's Natalie. Welcome back to my channel. Today I'm going to do a makeup tutorial as always. But first, story time, story time, story time. I just want to be up front with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery.

00:50.000 --> 00:59.000
I'm always going to be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean so much to me. Like, you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story. My whole entire journey.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
This journey I've been on.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
As a transgender woman.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
You've been with me on this whole journey.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
This is my truth and you've accepted the truth of my journey.

01:05.000 --> 01:10.000
This is a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just as special because you've been here for me throughout my whole transgender journey.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.000
The whole message of my journey as an influencer.

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
It's just been so impactful on my life and the truth of my living.

01:16.000 --> 01:18.000
It's just so meaningful that you guys have made it this far.

01:18.000 --> 01:24.000
It really means so much to me that you guys are supporting the truth of the life experience of my transgender journey as an YouTube influencer.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
And it's been so painful and during a really vulnerable time for me.

01:27.000 --> 01:30.000
And I'm just so grateful to you guys because you're so meaningful and you've encouraged me.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.000
I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel is that makeup is a lot of fun but it's inner beauty that really counts.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Anyway, let's talk about plastic surgery.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
I had facial feminization surgery on April 2nd, so about a month and a half ago.

01:42.000 --> 01:50.000
What we call facial feminization surgery or FFS is actually a series of different procedures that some transgender women choose to have to look more feminine.

01:50.000 --> 01:57.000
So what I had done is forehead contouring, a brow lift, rhinoplasty, mandible contouring, a trachea shave.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
You know what, let's just have the skull lady talk you through it.

01:59.000 --> 02:09.000
A coronal incision was made towards the cranial vault, whence the skin of the forehead was stripped away from the bone.

02:09.000 --> 02:17.000
A fragment of the supra-orbital ridge was then chiselled away, removed, reshaped and re-affixed,

02:17.000 --> 02:27.000
thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow that oftentimes distinguishes the skull of the child.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
A second incision was made

02:29.000 --> 02:31.620
the columella of the nasal septum,

02:31.620 --> 02:33.900
facilitating the reconstruction

02:33.900 --> 02:37.100
of the anterior cartilage and bone.

02:37.100 --> 02:41.740
Further incisions were made betwixt the gum and cheek,

02:41.740 --> 02:45.160
through which the mandible was rasped and shaved

02:45.160 --> 02:49.840
down to a gracile curvature of a jaw and pointed chin,

02:49.840 --> 02:52.640
thereby delineating a facial silhouette

02:52.640 --> 02:56.880
exhibiting that aspect which medical men call cunty.

02:56.880 --> 02:58.020
It all sounds pretty gruesome

02:58.020 --> 02:59.320
when you describe it like that,

02:59.320 --> 03:00.960
but there's actually a very fine level

03:00.960 --> 03:02.960
of technique and aesthetics involved.

03:02.960 --> 03:05.280
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.480
The results are natural,

03:06.480 --> 03:08.300
I don't look like I've had a bunch of work done,

03:08.300 --> 03:09.260
which is good, you know,

03:09.260 --> 03:10.900
you at least wanna leave people wondering,

03:10.900 --> 03:12.100
maybe she's born with it,

03:12.100 --> 03:13.740
maybe a surgeon peeled her face off

03:13.740 --> 03:14.960
and fixed her shitty skull.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.240
Here's a before and after picture

03:16.240 --> 03:17.720
where you can clearly see the difference.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.460
To use the exact medical terminology,

03:19.460 --> 03:22.260
my brows on fleek, my nose is no longer busted the house,

03:22.260 --> 03:24.920
my jaw snatched, and my Adam's apple is canceled.

03:24.920 --> 03:26.780
Wasn't it always really Eve's apple?

03:26.780 --> 03:27.900
Maybe Satan's apple?

03:27.900 --> 03:29.280
I think I still look like myself.

03:29.280 --> 03:30.760
It's not a new face.

03:30.760 --> 03:32.900
We're talking about millimeters of bone here.

03:32.900 --> 03:34.520
But to have all that done was,

03:34.520 --> 03:36.440
well, it costs a lot of money.

03:36.440 --> 03:39.920
The anticipation was, oh, terror like I've never known.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.120
The pain was memorable.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.020
And the recovery took more than a month.

03:44.020 --> 03:46.200
In fact, I still have some swelling in my jowls.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.140
Jowls, there's a nice feminine sounding word, love that.

03:49.140 --> 03:51.260
The standard YouTube T-girl thing to do, of course,

03:51.260 --> 03:52.940
would have been to vlog the whole journey.

03:52.940 --> 03:55.420
Story time, my facial surgery experience,

03:55.420 --> 03:57.740
my FFS journey, and post-constant social media,

03:57.740 --> 03:59.500
and all the media updates about it.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.980
And I am grateful to the trans women who have done that

04:01.980 --> 04:03.740
because it was really helpful to me

04:03.740 --> 04:05.920
to be able to watch those vlogs in advance

04:05.920 --> 04:07.800
and know what I was getting myself into.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.920
But I decided not to post about the surgery

04:09.920 --> 04:12.020
because I wanted privacy for the recovery

04:12.020 --> 04:14.360
and to just take some time to get to feel at home

04:14.360 --> 04:16.560
with the results before subjecting myself

04:16.560 --> 04:19.200
to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.620
You know, I think I've been kind of psychologically damaged

04:21.620 --> 04:23.580
by reading for years the things people say

04:23.580 --> 04:25.160
about my appearance online.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.040
And I'm not even talking about the haters.

04:27.040 --> 04:28.620
I mean, I can mostly brush them off.

04:28.620 --> 04:30.000
But for instance, about a year ago,

04:30.000 --> 04:31.920
I was reading through a transgender subreddit

04:31.920 --> 04:34.620
and some trans woman was agonizing about her appearance

04:34.620 --> 04:36.300
and someone offered the encouragement,

04:36.300 --> 04:39.620
you know, you can still look hot even if you don't pass.

04:39.620 --> 04:41.220
Just look at ContraPoints.

04:41.220 --> 04:44.120
Ugh, like a dagger to the heart.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.960
The unintentional shade of it all.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.840
So the past six weeks have been, at times,

04:49.840 --> 04:52.220
difficult and lonely, but I did manage to keep

04:52.220 --> 04:54.660
my mug off social media for long enough

04:54.660 --> 04:56.520
that I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be

04:56.520 --> 04:58.400
for the commentary of the internet.

04:58.400 --> 05:02.800
So bring it on, you jackals, you vultures, you goblin swine.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.920
While I was lying around bandaged and bored,

05:04.920 --> 05:06.540
I did have a lot of time to think.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.960
And what I've been thinking about

05:07.960 --> 05:10.700
is probably the same thing you're wondering right now,

05:10.700 --> 05:14.500
which is why would someone do what I just did?

05:14.500 --> 05:16.600
Why would I spend so much time and money

05:16.600 --> 05:18.900
and go through so much anxiety and pain

05:18.900 --> 05:21.600
just to change a few millimeters of bone?

05:21.600 --> 05:23.660
Isn't this all just extravagant vanity,

05:23.660 --> 05:26.440
some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much?

05:26.520 --> 05:28.300
Well, I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me

05:28.300 --> 05:31.380
to say that, in fact, this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all.

05:31.380 --> 05:32.980
Usually, trans people say that surgeries

05:32.980 --> 05:35.100
like facial feminization, top surgery,

05:35.100 --> 05:36.960
general reassignment, and so on,

05:36.960 --> 05:40.140
serve the sole purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria,

05:40.140 --> 05:42.560
this discomfort we feel with the mismatch

05:42.560 --> 05:44.640
between our bodies and our gender identity.

05:44.640 --> 05:46.600
So what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery

05:46.600 --> 05:49.640
was a medically necessary, reconstructive procedure

05:49.640 --> 05:52.880
needed to make my testosterone-weathered facial bones

05:52.880 --> 05:55.380
match the five-foot-two, happy baby bouncy bio girl

05:55.380 --> 05:56.520
I truly am inside.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.640
Thereby, alleviating my dysphoria,

05:58.640 --> 06:00.680
helping me safely blend into society,

06:00.680 --> 06:03.240
and preventing a five-alarm psychiatric meltdown.

06:03.240 --> 06:05.080
And there is definitely truth to that.

06:05.080 --> 06:06.920
It's certainly the argument I intend to make

06:06.920 --> 06:09.640
when I write this off as a medical expense on my taxes.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.440
If you're an IRS auditor, please stop this video now

06:12.440 --> 06:15.640
and insert the next floppy disk into your CD drive.

06:15.640 --> 06:17.080
But hypothetically speaking,

06:17.080 --> 06:19.960
I think the reality might not be quite so simple.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.520
How sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria

06:22.520 --> 06:24.600
from the other kinds of body image dysphoria

06:24.600 --> 06:26.040
that drive cisgender people

06:26.040 --> 06:28.120
to get cosmetic surgery all the time?

06:28.120 --> 06:31.080
Last year, when I used to foolishly tweet things of substance,

06:31.080 --> 06:33.240
I tweeted that I wanted to get FFS,

06:33.240 --> 06:35.080
and some trans people responded,

06:35.080 --> 06:36.280
telling me that I was suffering

06:36.280 --> 06:38.760
from internalized transphobia and self-loathing.

06:38.760 --> 06:40.520
They compared it to East Asian people

06:40.520 --> 06:42.120
getting double eyelid surgery,

06:42.120 --> 06:43.960
or so-called ethnic rhinoplasty,

06:43.960 --> 06:46.440
which they say are motivated by internalized racism

06:46.440 --> 06:47.960
and Western beauty standards.

06:47.960 --> 06:49.800
I think that's a pretty weak analogy,

06:49.800 --> 06:51.000
and telling a trans person

06:51.000 --> 06:52.920
to just learn to accept the way they look

06:52.920 --> 06:55.160
can actually be kind of transphobic,

06:55.160 --> 06:55.960
because a big part

06:55.960 --> 06:57.640
of what it even means to be trans,

06:57.640 --> 06:58.680
at least for me,

06:58.680 --> 07:00.520
is the desire to look more female.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.920
But I also think trans people often talk

07:02.920 --> 07:04.360
like gender dysphoria

07:04.360 --> 07:06.600
is this intrinsic, personal experience

07:06.600 --> 07:08.520
that's always 100% valid

07:08.520 --> 07:10.360
and never has anything at all to do

07:10.360 --> 07:12.600
with the external pressure of beauty standards.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.560
But in fact,

07:13.560 --> 07:16.040
gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum

07:16.040 --> 07:18.760
away from the influence of societal ideals and norms.

07:18.760 --> 07:19.880
Early in my transition,

07:19.880 --> 07:22.520
some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair,

07:22.520 --> 07:24.600
so I had full body laser hair removal,

07:24.600 --> 07:25.640
and now I'm smoother

07:25.640 --> 07:27.320
than a cisgender boiled egg.

07:27.320 --> 07:28.200
But where does the idea

07:28.200 --> 07:30.280
that women don't have body hair come from?

07:30.280 --> 07:32.520
Isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom?

07:32.520 --> 07:33.800
A lot of the cis women I know

07:33.800 --> 07:35.640
don't so much as shave their legs,

07:35.640 --> 07:38.760
so maybe I'm not even trying to look like a cis woman.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.160
Maybe I'm simply doing everything I can

07:41.160 --> 07:43.800
to avoid looking like the caricature

07:43.800 --> 07:45.240
of a knuckly, hairy,

07:46.600 --> 07:47.880
mannish trans woman

07:47.880 --> 07:50.920
with which society has terrorized me to my core.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.760
Is this gender dysphoria?

07:52.760 --> 07:55.080
Or is it internalized transphobia?

07:55.080 --> 07:57.560
Or is it simply a cosmetic preference?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.480
When I try to psychoanalyze myself,

07:59.480 --> 08:01.880
I find that my desires to look female,

08:01.880 --> 08:02.920
to look feminine,

08:02.920 --> 08:04.280
and to look beautiful

08:04.280 --> 08:05.800
are not exactly the same,

08:05.800 --> 08:08.200
but they're woven together so tightly

08:08.200 --> 08:10.520
that it's kind of difficult to untangle them.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.440
And the opposite is also true,

08:12.440 --> 08:13.160
that for me,

08:13.160 --> 08:15.240
feeling mannish or dysphoric

08:15.240 --> 08:17.480
usually goes along with feeling ugly.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.680
I don't have a lot of days

08:18.680 --> 08:20.280
where I walk out the house thinking,

08:20.280 --> 08:21.960
well, I'm giving femme queen realness,

08:21.960 --> 08:22.760
but apart from that,

08:22.760 --> 08:24.120
I look like absolute shit.

08:24.120 --> 08:24.440
Of course,

08:24.440 --> 08:26.440
there are qualities that make you look female

08:26.440 --> 08:28.360
that aren't necessarily attractive,

08:28.360 --> 08:30.360
like cellulite or flabby arms,

08:30.360 --> 08:31.720
which are super fish,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.720
but aren't deemed beautiful by society.

08:33.720 --> 08:34.440
The truth is,

08:34.440 --> 08:36.440
I don't just want to look female,

08:36.440 --> 08:37.960
I want to be beautiful.

08:38.520 --> 08:39.480
Desperately.

08:39.480 --> 08:40.440
God, I'll do anything.

08:41.160 --> 08:41.720
Anything.

08:42.360 --> 08:43.000
In this video,

08:43.000 --> 08:44.920
I want to explore why I'm so obsessed

08:44.920 --> 08:46.120
with being beautiful,

08:46.120 --> 08:47.640
and why it seems like a lot of people

08:47.640 --> 08:50.120
who live in a society are so obsessed.

08:50.120 --> 08:51.080
Is it phones?

08:51.640 --> 08:53.000
It's probably phones.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.120
I know you're supposed to pretend

08:54.120 --> 08:55.560
that you don't care about being beautiful

08:55.560 --> 08:56.600
or that you're not trying,

08:56.600 --> 08:57.640
but guys,

08:57.640 --> 08:58.600
it's the only thing I care about

08:58.600 --> 08:59.960
and I've never tried so hard at anything.

08:59.960 --> 09:00.280
Of course,

09:00.280 --> 09:02.840
I do feel guilty about being so obsessed with it,

09:02.840 --> 09:03.880
because there's this idea

09:03.880 --> 09:06.840
that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.240
You know,

09:07.240 --> 09:09.960
smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty,

09:09.960 --> 09:12.360
and I've always been categorized as a smart person

09:12.360 --> 09:13.480
by people around me.

09:13.480 --> 09:15.400
Some of that is when you're raised like I was,

09:15.400 --> 09:18.120
as a middle-class white boy with no athletic talent.

09:18.120 --> 09:21.320
Parents and teachers treat you like a fucking genius,

09:21.320 --> 09:23.960
like Einstein nutted a load in Mozart's bussy,

09:23.960 --> 09:25.320
and Mozart shat you out

09:25.320 --> 09:26.840
while he was getting a rusty trombone

09:26.840 --> 09:28.200
from Vincent van Gogh.

09:28.200 --> 09:29.800
It inspired his famous painting,

09:29.800 --> 09:30.680
Starfish Night.

09:30.680 --> 09:31.800
But even among women,

09:31.800 --> 09:33.960
caring about beauty is often frowned upon.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.640
I feel like an alien species

09:35.640 --> 09:37.640
when I hang out with women in academia,

09:37.640 --> 09:38.440
and I know a few

09:38.440 --> 09:39.960
because I once got half a PhD

09:39.960 --> 09:41.400
before dropping out to become a,

09:42.280 --> 09:43.640
what do you call someone who makes videos?

09:44.200 --> 09:44.920
A cam girl.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.080
Most female grad students and professors I know

09:47.080 --> 09:48.040
don't wear makeup.

09:48.040 --> 09:48.280
To them,

09:48.280 --> 09:50.680
the idea of earnestly putting on press-on nails

09:50.680 --> 09:52.920
or false eyelashes is inconceivable.

09:52.920 --> 09:53.080
Like,

09:53.080 --> 09:53.880
maybe on Halloween,

09:53.880 --> 09:57.080
and part of that is that women in male-dominated fields

09:57.080 --> 09:59.240
sometimes feel like they have to present more masculine

09:59.240 --> 10:00.680
to be taken seriously,

10:00.680 --> 10:01.800
because of this prejudice

10:01.800 --> 10:04.520
that beautified femininity equals frivolous.

10:04.520 --> 10:06.200
But another part is clearly some kind of

10:06.200 --> 10:08.040
not-like-other-girls weird flex.

10:08.040 --> 10:08.520
Which,

10:08.520 --> 10:09.240
okay,

10:09.240 --> 10:09.800
fine,

10:09.800 --> 10:10.440
whatever,

10:10.440 --> 10:11.800
I'm not gonna judge another woman

10:11.800 --> 10:13.560
for the way she copes with a society

10:13.560 --> 10:15.240
that pressures women to be beautiful

10:15.240 --> 10:18.120
while simultaneously belittling them for caring about it.

10:18.120 --> 10:20.280
I guess my way of coping is this tacky,

10:20.280 --> 10:21.160
heteronormative,

10:21.160 --> 10:23.240
and tragically sincere aspiration

10:23.240 --> 10:25.960
to some kind of post-ironic feminine beauty.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.080
Why am I like this?

10:27.080 --> 10:29.480
Well, part of it is vindictive transsexualism,

10:29.480 --> 10:30.360
pure and simple.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.040
To all the people who've ever called me a man,

10:32.040 --> 10:32.600
I wanna say,

10:33.240 --> 10:33.960
fuck you.

10:33.960 --> 10:37.320
By looking like the undeniable visual archetype of a woman,

10:37.320 --> 10:39.320
which is a beautiful, feminine woman.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.480
Who's wearing 600,000 sequins.

10:43.480 --> 10:44.840
They're biological sequins.

10:46.120 --> 10:46.620
Uh.

10:48.200 --> 10:48.760
Ooh.

10:48.760 --> 10:50.440
That is some ASMR right there,

10:50.440 --> 10:50.940
listen to that.

10:52.280 --> 10:52.780
Oh.

10:53.240 --> 10:53.740
Oh.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.920
Another factor is this shitty website.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.400
I'm a professional YouTube influencer,

11:07.400 --> 11:08.600
forgive me father,

11:08.600 --> 11:10.120
and I'm on camera all the time.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.240
I edit my own videos,

11:11.240 --> 11:13.720
so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month

11:13.720 --> 11:15.720
staring at my own face on a screen.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.760
Now you try doing that

11:16.760 --> 11:19.080
and see what kind of fucked up complex you develop.

11:19.080 --> 11:22.280
Plus, I compare myself to other women who make videos.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.520
A lot of the trans women on YouTube are so young,

11:24.520 --> 11:25.400
and so beautiful,

11:25.400 --> 11:26.920
it makes me wanna throw up.

11:26.920 --> 11:27.800
And in comparison,

11:27.800 --> 11:28.680
for a long time,

11:28.680 --> 11:31.160
I've felt like this shabby,

11:31.160 --> 11:32.680
aging transvestite.

11:32.680 --> 11:36.600
Just this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store.

11:36.600 --> 11:37.640
So I'm insecure,

11:37.640 --> 11:39.560
I'm compensating for that whole mess,

11:39.560 --> 11:42.200
but I honestly don't resent the beautiful people,

11:42.200 --> 11:44.520
I really just stand the hell out of them.

11:44.520 --> 11:45.880
I follow this woman on YouTube,

11:45.880 --> 11:47.480
but I wanna be just like her mom.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.960
Her name is Dame Jefferson Starr.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.560
Her name is Lady Jane McLean.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.120
Senora Nicole Beatrice Tutorials.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.440
Tatyana Petrovna West-Rykova.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.120
And of course my queen and perfect goddess,

11:58.120 --> 11:58.840
whomst I stan,

11:58.840 --> 12:00.840
and whose portrait I've painted hundreds of times.

12:00.840 --> 12:02.920
So there's maybe some extra intensity for me,

12:02.920 --> 12:04.600
but I think it's actually pretty normal

12:04.600 --> 12:05.720
to wanna be beautiful.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.640
I think even grad students wanna be beautiful.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.720
They just wanna do it in that Becky kind of way,

12:09.720 --> 12:12.120
where you scoff at anything glam or artificial.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.520
And it's not just women who care about beauty either.

12:14.520 --> 12:17.240
I mean, gay men in LA have always been getting cosmetic surgery,

12:17.240 --> 12:19.080
but now even the straights are doing it.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.560
Incels are completely obsessed with the details,

12:21.560 --> 12:23.400
the defects of their personal appearance.

12:23.400 --> 12:25.160
And the ones who aren't completely black-pilled

12:25.160 --> 12:26.920
are obsessed with plastic surgery.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.200
The incel newspeak word for beauty is looks-maxing,

12:30.200 --> 12:31.640
because of course they have to go about this

12:31.640 --> 12:33.480
in the most heterosexual possible way.

12:33.480 --> 12:35.800
It is imperative to implement a skin-max regimen

12:35.800 --> 12:37.640
in order to maximize looks-money status

12:37.640 --> 12:39.320
and secure access to females.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.440
Oh my god, calm down.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.960
Not every sentence out of your mouth

12:41.960 --> 12:44.600
has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.880
Yes, they actually call skincare skin-maxing.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.800
James Charles, I know you're having a hard month,

12:49.800 --> 12:51.160
but I've got a business idea

12:51.560 --> 12:52.920
to turn this thing around for you.

12:52.920 --> 12:53.800
Here's the plan.

12:53.800 --> 12:55.800
You're gonna create a new line of skincare products

12:55.800 --> 12:57.960
called Chad Glow.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.520
Bribe PewDiePie to send his fans to the promo video,

13:00.520 --> 13:01.880
hi sister cells,

13:01.880 --> 13:03.960
and send me a check in the mail, you're welcome.

13:03.960 --> 13:05.480
If you read looks-max forums,

13:05.480 --> 13:08.200
they're filled with discussions of brow ridge implants,

13:08.200 --> 13:10.440
chin implants, mandible implants.

13:10.440 --> 13:14.680
It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad

13:14.680 --> 13:18.360
exhibiteth a jawbone most robust.

13:18.360 --> 13:21.320
It's literally facial masculinization surgery.

13:21.320 --> 13:23.480
So everyone's obsessed with the bones,

13:23.480 --> 13:25.000
everyone's obsessed with beauty,

13:25.000 --> 13:29.080
whether man or woman, cis or trans, gay or gamer.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.400
Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin',

13:31.400 --> 13:33.480
while everyone else has completely lost their minds.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.360
But why?

13:34.360 --> 13:35.960
Why do we care so much?

13:35.960 --> 13:37.880
Well with incels, by their own account,

13:37.880 --> 13:40.920
the only reason they care is they think that looks-maxing

13:40.920 --> 13:42.840
will make femoids have sex with them,

13:42.840 --> 13:45.640
and they think that will make their lives feel meaningful,

13:45.640 --> 13:48.200
which it will not.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.880
So incels are canceled.

13:49.880 --> 13:50.760
Now what about women?

13:50.760 --> 13:51.400
What's our deal?

13:51.400 --> 13:52.200
What's our sitch?

13:52.200 --> 13:52.840
What's our vibe?

13:52.840 --> 13:53.720
What's our vij?

13:53.720 --> 13:56.680
Well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels,

13:56.680 --> 13:58.920
that we care about beauty and wear makeup,

13:58.920 --> 13:59.560
fake up,

13:59.560 --> 14:01.400
because we're trying to attract men.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.480
My daddy Dom went on Vice News last year

14:03.480 --> 14:04.920
and said that women wear makeup

14:04.920 --> 14:07.560
because they're trying to stimulate male sexual arousal

14:07.560 --> 14:09.000
and because evolution.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.440
Now with the risk of being bratty,

14:10.440 --> 14:14.360
I gotta say this is maybe 10% true and 90% false.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.840
For one thing, straight men don't like makeup.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.040
At least they don't think they do.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.600
Here's a chart I made illustrating what every straight man

14:20.600 --> 14:22.280
in the world thinks about makeup.

14:22.280 --> 14:23.800
Yes, I asked all of them.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.440
If you wear no makeup, they think you look diseased.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.640
And I actually do look diseased

14:27.640 --> 14:29.240
when I don't wear makeup so fair enough.

14:29.240 --> 14:30.840
If you wear natural makeup, you know,

14:30.840 --> 14:33.720
a little concealer, mascara, maybe a nude lip,

14:33.720 --> 14:36.040
they think you're not wearing any makeup and they like it.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.280
If you wear campy makeup, colorful eyeshadow,

14:38.280 --> 14:40.200
heavy contouring, overdrawn lips,

14:40.200 --> 14:41.800
they think it's dumb and they hate it.

14:41.800 --> 14:43.480
Of course I'm generalizing.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.320
Hashtag not all daddy doms.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.800
But if women really wore makeup to attract men,

14:47.800 --> 14:49.800
then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing it

14:49.800 --> 14:50.520
when there are no men.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.360
But that doesn't happen.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.680
About a month ago, there was that video going around

14:54.680 --> 14:56.920
of a woman showing how to make jailhouse makeup,

14:56.920 --> 14:59.720
mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow,

14:59.720 --> 15:02.200
using Kool-Aid and Vaseline to make lipstick.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.360
There's not a lot of men in women's prison,

15:04.360 --> 15:06.360
but women are still performing incredible feats

15:06.360 --> 15:09.400
of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.320
So maybe women are using makeup

15:11.320 --> 15:14.120
to express their individuality and femininity,

15:14.120 --> 15:17.320
you know, things that prison tries to take away from you.

15:17.320 --> 15:18.360
Kinda makes sense.

15:18.360 --> 15:20.200
There's a Refinery29 documentary

15:20.200 --> 15:23.720
about prison cosmetology and also sexual exploitation, yikes,

15:23.720 --> 15:26.120
in which a former inmate describes how women would engage

15:26.120 --> 15:29.400
in sexual bartering with male guards just to get makeup.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.680
If a girl's performing sexual favors for an officer,

15:32.680 --> 15:36.040
he would bring her in colored pencils, lip gloss,

15:36.040 --> 15:37.000
things like that.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.600
That's right, women are sucking dicks

15:38.600 --> 15:41.640
that they can put on makeup, not the other way around.

15:41.640 --> 15:44.360
Honestly, if all the men died tomorrow, F,

15:44.360 --> 15:46.200
I'd definitely keep wearing makeup.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.320
In fact, I might wear more.

15:47.320 --> 15:48.280
And I'm not just saying that

15:48.280 --> 15:50.040
because I'm trying to win feminist poise,

15:50.200 --> 15:50.760
or anything.

15:50.760 --> 15:52.600
Like, do I want to attract men?

15:52.600 --> 15:53.960
Yes, of course I do.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.080
Do I want to attract women?

15:55.880 --> 15:56.360
I guess.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.120
I don't really think about it.

15:58.120 --> 16:01.240
Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them

16:01.240 --> 16:02.680
while quietly dying inside?

16:03.400 --> 16:04.840
Whatever, it's fine.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.160
I want to attract non-binary people too, of course,

16:07.160 --> 16:09.480
but right now you guys are kind of getting in the way

16:09.480 --> 16:12.200
of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender,

16:12.200 --> 16:13.880
so how dare you?

16:13.880 --> 16:15.800
The point is, when I think about my appearance,

16:15.800 --> 16:17.640
wanting to attract people to have sex with

16:17.640 --> 16:19.720
is not the main thing going through my head.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.000
What is going through my head?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.240
I guess I just want to feel beautiful,

16:29.240 --> 16:30.680
I want to see myself in the mirror

16:30.680 --> 16:32.760
and think I look snatched, is that a crime?

16:32.760 --> 16:34.360
I don't feel pretty very often.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.280
I'd say it happens about once a month

16:36.280 --> 16:37.800
when I'm having a good skin day,

16:37.800 --> 16:39.320
I do my makeup just right,

16:39.320 --> 16:41.160
I glisten with setting spray,

16:41.720 --> 16:43.000
and then it happens.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.680
A tingle goes up my spine.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.760
I am Botticelli.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.920
I am Van Gogh.

16:48.920 --> 16:53.920
I have created beauty, I'm a girl.

16:55.160 --> 16:56.960
And then it's over, that's it for a month.

16:56.960 --> 16:58.040
Usually when I look in the mirror,

16:58.040 --> 17:00.140
I can't actually tell whether I'm pretty or not.

17:00.140 --> 17:01.820
Like with other people, I can just look at them

17:01.820 --> 17:03.740
and instantly make a judgment about it,

17:03.740 --> 17:06.380
but with myself, I have to just guess.

17:06.380 --> 17:07.820
It's the same as being a trans person

17:07.820 --> 17:10.260
trying to figure out whether you pass.

17:10.260 --> 17:12.100
Would you clock me?

17:12.100 --> 17:13.160
I'd clock me.

17:14.100 --> 17:16.100
I'd fuck me too, I don't give a shit.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.540
Get out of my room, mom!

17:18.540 --> 17:19.800
It doesn't work like that for me.

17:19.800 --> 17:21.960
I have to rely on other people's feedback.

17:21.960 --> 17:24.160
Of course, the problem with other people's feedback

17:24.160 --> 17:26.500
is that people are liars.

17:26.500 --> 17:28.760
You look great, hon.

17:28.760 --> 17:31.300
Especially when those people are your fans.

17:31.300 --> 17:32.860
Boots the house queen, stuff in my throat,

17:32.860 --> 17:34.180
mother, I'll die for you.

17:34.180 --> 17:35.060
Oh my God.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.300
Or when they're your haters.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.300
Your disgusting giant collarbone

17:38.300 --> 17:41.380
outs you as a man at a thousand paces.

17:41.380 --> 17:43.300
I guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty or not.

17:43.300 --> 17:46.340
But I can estimate, like I have figured out

17:46.340 --> 17:48.040
that I'm too pretty for Twitter,

17:48.040 --> 17:51.160
but I'm not sure yet if I'm pretty enough for Instagram.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.500
It's hard being a six.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.800
I have been dipping my toes in the Instagram water.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.220
Before my surgery, I got into a pretty good rhythm

17:57.220 --> 17:59.260
of posting my shitty little makeup looks,

17:59.260 --> 18:00.980
and what I find addictive about it

18:00.980 --> 18:03.480
is this constant flow of positive comments

18:03.480 --> 18:06.500
from other people, even though I know it's mostly flattery.

18:06.500 --> 18:09.500
You invented beauty, perfect angel, choke me, mommy.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.920
Every time I get a comment like that,

18:10.920 --> 18:13.480
I'm perfectly aware that it's wild exaggeration

18:13.480 --> 18:15.500
fueled by parasocial delusions,

18:15.500 --> 18:18.040
but I still get a hit of dopamine in my biologically-fueled,

18:18.040 --> 18:19.080
female brain.

18:19.080 --> 18:21.080
And the intoxicating thing about Instagram

18:21.080 --> 18:24.100
is that the embellishment of the truth is a two-way street,

18:24.100 --> 18:26.220
thanks to the miracle of Facetune.

18:26.220 --> 18:28.500
Yes, we finally get to talk about the phones.

18:28.500 --> 18:30.720
See, it's a black mirror because it's a window

18:30.720 --> 18:32.780
into the darkness of the human soul.

18:32.780 --> 18:33.620
Get it?

18:33.620 --> 18:34.800
Should I explain it again?

18:34.800 --> 18:36.760
Phones live in a society.

18:36.760 --> 18:38.580
Facetune is an app that lets you fix

18:38.580 --> 18:40.080
all the problems with your face.

18:40.080 --> 18:42.840
So here's an unedited pre-FFS picture of me.

18:42.840 --> 18:45.420
What I would do in Facetune is smooth out the complexion,

18:45.420 --> 18:47.960
shrink the nose a little, bring the jaw in,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.640
and use the vibrance tool to make the eyeshadow pop.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.000
It's really no more drastic

18:52.000 --> 18:54.200
than the kinds of photo doctoring people have been doing

18:54.200 --> 18:55.900
since the invention of photography.

18:55.900 --> 18:58.360
What's changed is that now everyone is doing it

18:58.360 --> 19:00.540
to their own photos every day.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.420
And I've noticed that when I'm in the habit

19:02.420 --> 19:04.660
of editing my flaws out of pictures,

19:04.660 --> 19:06.980
when I look at an unedited picture of myself,

19:06.980 --> 19:08.500
or when I look in the mirror,

19:08.500 --> 19:11.380
my eyes go straight to the flaws.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.680
Why are my pores so big?

19:13.680 --> 19:17.120
Why aren't medical scientists doing something to stop this?

19:17.120 --> 19:19.640
Is this really a good use of my mental energy?

19:19.640 --> 19:21.080
Here comes that guilt again.

19:21.080 --> 19:22.660
Instead of worrying about my pores,

19:22.660 --> 19:24.300
shouldn't I be helping stop

19:24.300 --> 19:25.980
the impending climate catastrophe

19:25.980 --> 19:27.400
that's gonna destroy the planet

19:27.400 --> 19:29.880
if we don't change the economy in like 12 years?

19:29.880 --> 19:31.520
Shit, I guess it's 11 years now.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.240
It's just hard to focus on climate change

19:33.240 --> 19:34.980
when there's so much else on my mind.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.100
He's just so cute.

19:42.100 --> 19:44.420
I guess I'd just rather think about the aesthetic

19:44.420 --> 19:45.780
than the apocalypse.

19:45.780 --> 19:46.840
And that's the darkness.

19:47.120 --> 19:49.740
Why is my neck like two decades older

19:49.740 --> 19:51.820
than the rest of my skin?

19:51.820 --> 19:53.500
Do I need Botox yet?

19:53.500 --> 19:54.860
Should I get a facelift?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.440
These are the questions that will no doubt

19:56.440 --> 19:58.580
define the next couple decades of my life.

19:58.580 --> 20:00.520
As if it wasn't bad enough to have to go

20:00.520 --> 20:02.840
through a second adolescence on camera,

20:02.840 --> 20:04.700
I also have to deal with aging,

20:04.700 --> 20:07.400
and thus the ritual of skincare products.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.900
Here's my daytime routine.

20:08.900 --> 20:11.900
So first, I'm gonna mix the Dermalogica exfoliator

20:11.900 --> 20:15.020
with the cleansing gel and just massage my face.

20:15.020 --> 20:16.560
None of this is sponsored, by the way.

20:16.560 --> 20:18.460
This is just me supporting corporations

20:18.460 --> 20:20.100
out of the kindness of my heart.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.660
Now, if I'm not running late for something,

20:22.660 --> 20:24.160
I will do a face mask.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.200
But if I'm out of bed,

20:26.200 --> 20:27.980
it's because I'm running late for something.

20:27.980 --> 20:32.440
So I've never done a face mask.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.300
Now, I'm gonna use a toner, which is very important.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.660
Now, a lot of people don't know what a toner does,

20:37.660 --> 20:42.660
but look, it tones okay.

20:42.880 --> 20:44.820
Do you want your face to be untoned?

20:44.820 --> 20:45.680
Next, I'm gonna spray

20:45.680 --> 20:48.700
the expensive Korean yeast directly into my eyes.

20:49.560 --> 20:51.200
I use this because it's actually a lot cheaper

20:51.200 --> 20:52.700
than the Japanese yeast,

20:52.700 --> 20:54.860
so you're really losing money if you don't buy it.

20:54.860 --> 20:56.060
Think of the savings.

20:56.060 --> 20:57.960
Now, I'm gonna mix a pump of hyaluronic acid

20:57.960 --> 21:02.300
with a couple spritzes of organic Bulgarian rose water.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.140
You can almost smell the Bulgarian rose fields.

21:05.140 --> 21:05.980
It's enchanting.

21:05.980 --> 21:06.820
It's like I'm there.

21:06.820 --> 21:09.320
There's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather.

21:09.320 --> 21:11.840
I use this moisturizer because Gigi Gorgeous told me to,

21:11.840 --> 21:14.320
and I do everything Gigi says.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.520
Every fucking thing.

21:15.680 --> 21:17.460
I know it seems like a lot of products,

21:17.460 --> 21:21.120
but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection,

21:21.120 --> 21:23.360
the tendency is to push it as far as you can.

21:23.360 --> 21:25.040
I feel like I'm forgetting something.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.440
A sunscreen.

21:26.440 --> 21:28.440
I'm not really sure what this does.

21:28.440 --> 21:29.460
We can probably skip it.

21:29.460 --> 21:31.040
And I'm just gonna finish it all off

21:31.040 --> 21:33.960
with some more expensive mist.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.500
Yes, God.

21:35.500 --> 21:36.560
I love a good facial.

21:36.560 --> 21:39.000
I'm so fucking wet right now.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.340
So after all these products,

21:40.340 --> 21:43.920
does my skin look clearer, younger, more toned?

21:43.920 --> 21:45.520
Well, it's hard to say, but I think it does.

21:45.520 --> 21:48.760
I would say for sure, but it certainly is moist.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.280
This is the part where I usually just stare at my own face

21:51.280 --> 21:53.480
for 10 minutes and contemplate the futility

21:53.480 --> 21:56.080
of my struggle against the ravages of time.

22:05.680 --> 22:07.520
I'm fine.

22:07.520 --> 22:08.700
It's fine.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.460
This is fine.

22:10.460 --> 22:11.300
It's fine.

22:15.520 --> 22:20.520
So, isn't beauty supposed to be fun?

22:37.120 --> 22:39.100
I'm not having fun right now.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.960
Why am I not having fun?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.340
I guess I just don't feel beautiful.

22:43.340 --> 22:45.220
And I know a lot of people think I'm pretty,

22:45.220 --> 22:47.540
and I know a lot of other people have it worse than me,

22:47.540 --> 22:49.120
and I know I should be grateful,

22:49.120 --> 22:52.080
and I know I'm privileged to be able to get plastic surgery,

22:52.080 --> 22:54.320
and I know I shouldn't care so much about this

22:54.320 --> 22:55.340
in the first place.

22:55.340 --> 22:59.040
But the truth is that this just eats away at me,

22:59.040 --> 23:02.480
and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain.

23:02.480 --> 23:04.820
I've been kind of depressed this past month,

23:04.820 --> 23:07.960
and I think part of it is that on a subconscious level,

23:07.960 --> 23:10.580
I think I was hoping that surgery would completely

23:10.580 --> 23:13.440
change my self-image and make me like myself.

23:13.440 --> 23:14.020
But it really hasn't.

23:14.020 --> 23:14.860
I'm not sure.

23:14.860 --> 23:16.860
I mean, I'm happy with the results,

23:16.860 --> 23:18.340
I'd do it all again,

23:18.340 --> 23:21.180
but I still feel the way I felt before.

23:21.180 --> 23:23.400
You have to keep in mind that surgery fixes

23:23.400 --> 23:25.380
very specific problems,

23:25.380 --> 23:26.960
like the Adam's apple problem,

23:26.960 --> 23:29.500
or the way my forehead looks in profile problem.

23:29.500 --> 23:33.920
But it's really not a solution to deep psychological issues.

23:33.920 --> 23:35.980
I still don't feel beautiful,

23:35.980 --> 23:38.520
and I need to face the fact that I'm never going

23:38.520 --> 23:41.240
to feel beautiful unless I change the way I think.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.640
Because I'm trapped in a doom spiral over here,

23:43.640 --> 23:44.740
and if I'm ever gonna get out,

23:44.740 --> 23:47.780
I think I need to start by forgiving myself

23:47.780 --> 23:49.600
for wanting to be beautiful.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.760
There's lots of reasons to wanna be beautiful

23:51.760 --> 23:53.960
besides being shallow and vain.

23:53.960 --> 23:56.740
For one, beauty is associated with youth,

23:56.740 --> 23:59.520
it's a symbol of life, of defiance, of death.

23:59.520 --> 24:02.280
That's a profound thing to be concerned about.

24:02.280 --> 24:04.840
See, I'm not a bimbo, I'm a poet.

24:04.840 --> 24:07.540
Beauty is also associated with moral worth,

24:07.540 --> 24:10.140
the beautiful princess versus the evil hag.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.240
There's studies showing that conventionally attractive

24:12.240 --> 24:14.720
people are more likely to be assumed to be happy, healthy,

24:14.740 --> 24:17.540
healthy, and trustworthy, they're more likely to be hired.

24:17.540 --> 24:19.440
So it's not just about Instagram likes,

24:19.440 --> 24:20.900
this is serious stuff.

24:20.900 --> 24:23.500
And we, the woke, we are all aware of this.

24:23.500 --> 24:26.940
We know that beauty is power, that beauty is political.

24:26.940 --> 24:29.280
We know that beauty standards come from the people

24:29.280 --> 24:31.460
with privilege in an unequal society.

24:31.460 --> 24:34.240
We know it's unjust that being light-skinned, cis,

24:34.240 --> 24:37.100
able-bodied, or thin is considered more attractive

24:37.100 --> 24:40.080
than being dark-skinned, trans, disabled, or fat.

24:40.080 --> 24:42.100
We know that female beauty matters so much

24:42.100 --> 24:43.340
because it's patriarchy.

24:43.340 --> 24:45.960
We know that our obsession with beauty is being provoked

24:45.960 --> 24:48.120
by advertising, the cosmetic industry,

24:48.120 --> 24:51.060
and beauty influencers who are trying to sell us products.

24:51.060 --> 24:52.860
We know, we know, we know all this

24:52.860 --> 24:54.480
because we've all been sitting around

24:54.480 --> 24:56.320
critiquing it for decades.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.220
Because that's what leftists do, we critique things.

25:00.220 --> 25:03.300
We are finely-tuned detectors of racism, sexism,

25:03.300 --> 25:07.220
ableism, fatphobia, transphobia, and capitalism-run AMAC.

25:07.220 --> 25:09.880
We notice an injustice, we problematize it,

25:09.880 --> 25:12.780
we critique it, and then we cancel it.

25:12.780 --> 25:13.340
But what's next?

25:13.340 --> 25:15.120
When we're done critiquing things,

25:15.120 --> 25:17.440
what are we supposed to do?

25:17.440 --> 25:20.080
Because I'm aware that conventional beauty standards

25:20.080 --> 25:22.300
are a racist, sexist, ableist, fatphobic,

25:22.300 --> 25:24.860
transphobic social construct designed to preserve

25:24.860 --> 25:26.780
power relations and sell products,

25:26.780 --> 25:29.620
but does that awareness mean I desire any less

25:29.620 --> 25:31.220
to be conventionally beautiful?

25:31.220 --> 25:33.040
Well, no.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.340
I want it more than ever.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.740
The problem is that the intellectual exercise

25:36.740 --> 25:39.460
of critiquing things doesn't usually affect

25:39.460 --> 25:41.620
my desires very much.

25:41.620 --> 25:43.160
So what am I supposed to do?

25:43.160 --> 25:44.960
Sit here in silent contemplation

25:44.960 --> 25:47.040
until my desires finally align themselves

25:47.040 --> 25:50.200
with the interests of the international proletarian revolution?

25:50.200 --> 25:51.920
Oh, fuck the revolution.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.460
I want to be a pretty rich girl.

25:53.460 --> 25:55.140
I don't want to be ContraPoints anymore.

25:55.140 --> 25:56.840
I want to be Gigi Gorgeous.

25:56.840 --> 25:59.520
Fighting fascists on YouTube was an idea I came up with

25:59.520 --> 26:01.560
when I was a male alcoholic.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.820
Unfortunately, America needs a ContraPoints right now

26:03.820 --> 26:07.440
more than it needs a 30-year-old Gigi Gorgeous impersonator,

26:07.440 --> 26:09.200
so I guess I'm stuck with it.

26:09.200 --> 26:11.000
Maybe it's for the best.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.040
Critiquing society may not change our desires,

26:13.040 --> 26:15.760
but it can motivate us to change society.

26:15.760 --> 26:18.620
And changing society can change our desires.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.460
So how do we change society?

26:21.460 --> 26:22.580
Revolution.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.160
Well, sure, revolution.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.900
Depending on what happens in 2020,

26:25.900 --> 26:28.000
I'll think of grabbing a brick myself.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.800
But failing that, I think there are ways we can work

26:30.800 --> 26:33.360
to loosen the grip of restrictive beauty standards

26:33.360 --> 26:36.500
without the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.

26:36.500 --> 26:38.400
I do think representation matters,

26:38.400 --> 26:40.420
and I think having visible beauty icons

26:40.420 --> 26:43.040
who are dark-skinned or trans or gender nonconforming

26:43.040 --> 26:47.200
or disabled or fat or over 35 or influencers

26:47.200 --> 26:48.540
makes a big difference.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.420
Beauty standards are social constructs,

26:50.420 --> 26:52.560
and social constructs can change.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.600
That's why it's so important to recognize

26:54.600 --> 26:58.220
that influencers are just as valid as other celebrities.

26:58.220 --> 26:59.820
But the problem with changing society

26:59.820 --> 27:01.320
is that it takes a long time,

27:01.320 --> 27:03.160
and this video is almost over.

27:03.160 --> 27:06.420
Where I can see an escape from my particular doom spiral

27:06.420 --> 27:09.940
is in style as an alternative ideal to beauty.

27:09.940 --> 27:12.860
You can be stylish at any age, you can be stylish

27:12.860 --> 27:14.240
whether you pass or not.

27:14.240 --> 27:17.360
Style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic

27:17.360 --> 27:19.220
that you have complete control over.

27:19.220 --> 27:22.620
It's like art in that originality is a virtue.

27:22.620 --> 27:25.080
Style is an individual aesthetic,

27:25.080 --> 27:28.220
unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards.

27:28.220 --> 27:31.200
As the poet Wordsworth said about artistic appreciation,

27:31.200 --> 27:33.240
"'Every author, as far as he is great

27:33.240 --> 27:35.080
"'and at the same time original,

27:35.080 --> 27:37.800
"'has had the task of creating the taste

27:37.800 --> 27:39.800
"'by which he is to be enjoyed.'"

27:39.800 --> 27:41.000
So even if you don't conform

27:41.000 --> 27:42.680
to conventional beauty standards,

27:42.680 --> 27:44.920
through the power of original style,

27:44.920 --> 27:46.860
you can create the taste

27:46.860 --> 27:49.440
by which your unique beauty is to be appreciated.

27:49.440 --> 27:52.480
Society may frown upon us six-foot trannies,

27:52.480 --> 27:55.640
but if I know I'm dressed well or my makeup is snatched,

27:55.640 --> 27:59.000
I can easily abide any comment, any stare.

27:59.000 --> 28:02.300
I can be misgendered a Dairy Queen for all I care.

28:02.300 --> 28:03.920
It does not matter.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.480
I can strut with confidence

28:05.480 --> 28:08.300
because I am basking in the regal knowledge

28:08.300 --> 28:10.920
of my own aesthetic superiority.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.220
Bow before me, peasants!

28:12.220 --> 28:14.220
I proclaim to the drive-through window,

28:14.220 --> 28:17.220
for I am serving a lurk.

28:17.220 --> 28:20.220
Sir, this is a Dairy Queen.

28:20.220 --> 28:22.220
So, I guess that's the solution.

28:22.220 --> 28:26.220
I can't believe I single-handedly ended capitalism.

28:26.220 --> 28:27.220
Now, does that mean I'm not gonna get

28:27.220 --> 28:29.220
a lot of expensive plastic surgery?

28:29.220 --> 28:30.220
Fuck no!

28:30.220 --> 28:32.220
What do you people think I am,

28:32.220 --> 28:34.220
some kind of transgender Mother Teresa?

28:34.220 --> 28:35.220
Goddamn.

28:35.220 --> 28:37.220
The audacity of you people.

28:37.220 --> 28:38.220
The hubris.

28:38.220 --> 28:40.220
Look, I need plastic surgery because I have no style.

28:40.220 --> 28:41.220
In fact, after the month of surgery,

28:41.220 --> 28:43.220
you should be grateful I'm wearing clothes at all.

28:43.220 --> 28:44.220
So, that's it for me.

28:44.220 --> 28:46.220
I guess I have nothing but the decay of time and age

28:46.220 --> 28:47.220
to look forward to.

28:47.220 --> 28:49.220
I guess I'll just have to find my self-worth

28:49.220 --> 28:52.220
in cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty.

28:52.220 --> 28:53.220
Ew.

28:53.220 --> 28:54.220
Gross.

29:11.220 --> 29:41.220


29:41.220 --> 30:11.220


30:11.220 --> 30:41.220


30:41.220 --> 30:48.220
I'm drooling all over myself

30:48.220 --> 30:51.220
because my jaw is still numb from the surgery.

30:51.220 --> 30:52.220
Love that.
