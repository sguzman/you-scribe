1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,460
Okay. Let's get started. I literally need a man. I need a man. Help! Alright, I'm gonna

2
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:29,520
get pliers. The lesbian solution. Okay. Let's get started.

3
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:43,200
I love my king. This is not really the most feminine moment for me. Not really my

4
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,080
2020 vibe, but it does proportionize my giant man hands.

5
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,840
Meow, meow, meow.

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,000
Alright, no one thinks I'm cute. Let's get started. Okay, look, this video is about

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,140
canceling, also known as cancel culture, formerly known as call-out culture. And I know you kids

8
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,920
know all about this, but before we dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow boomers.

9
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:11,800
So listen up, oldies. In the lingo of these young, avocado-guzzling, smartphone addicts

10
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:18,320
who killed Applebee's, canceling is online shaming, vilifying, and ostracizing of prominent

11
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,780
members of a community by

12
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,020
other members of that community. Like so much internet slang, this use of the word

13
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:30,620
canceling started out on black Twitter, where a few years ago, people, well, mostly women,

14
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:35,220
would tweet, cancel R. Kelly, and things like that. You know, it started out as this vigilante

15
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,560
strategy for bringing justice and accountability to powerful people who previously had been

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,860
immune to any consequences for their actions.

17
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,340
For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media shaming to topple sexually abusive men in power,

18
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:56,580
who couldn't be held accountable any other way. The promise of canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none,

19
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:04,920
and bring justice to prominent abusers. It's in a way, the 21st century version of the guillotine, the bringer of justice, the people's avenger.

20
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:17,320
But also like the guillotine, it can become a sadistic entertainment spectacle. And I want to make the case that we do have, well, a teensy bit of a Reign of Terror situation on our hands, Gorg.

21
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:21,520
Now, there's a version of this conversation that's already been had to death, and it goes like this.

22
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:27,040
On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly bitch about how cancel culture is out of control.

23
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,560
You can't joke about anything anymore without these millennial jackals trying to get you in trouble.

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:37,180
And the other side is mostly progressive think piece authors who argue that there's no such thing as cancel culture,

25
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:42,580
it's just that powerful people are finally being held accountable for their actions, and they can't fucking handle it,

26
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,900
so they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now, unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints,

27
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,820
is quite as correct as some people might hope. So it's a good thing I'm here to deliver the truth.

28
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,820
He didn't know I was transgender.

29
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,820
Story time. Emotional, not clickbait.

30
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:02,820
Let's start with an example. The most high-profile YouTube canceling of 2019 was the canceling of James Charles.

31
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:08,320
And again, I know you kids remember this, but I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders.

32
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Put the kettle on, Karen.

33
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:15,320
So James Charles is a 20-year-old beauty guru, which means, um, boomers.

34
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,320
Look, there's these people,

35
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,320
who make YouTube videos,

36
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,320
teaching you how to do makeup.

37
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,320
It's worth checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer.

38
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,320
I certainly can't.

39
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,320
It's pretty bomb. It's lit. It's, uh,

40
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
it's groovy. It's fab. It's far out, man.

41
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,320
It's a gas. I fully dig it.

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Free love. Give peace a chance.

43
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Nixon's a fascist.

44
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,320
So back in May of this year, James's colleague and

45
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,320
mother figure?

46
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:44,320
Fellow YouTube beauty guru Tati Westbrook

47
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,320
uploaded a 40-minute video

48
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:49,320
accusing James of endorsing

49
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,320
a different brand of hair vitamins

50
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,320
than the brand that she,

51
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,320
wait, that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins.

52
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,320
An enthralling plotline, I know.

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,320
And this was huge. This was covered in the New York Times.

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,320
And while Tati was at it,

55
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,320
almost as an afterthought to the, uh,

56
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,320
hair vitamin dispute,

57
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
she also accused James of being

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,320
a sexual predator.

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
Now, I actually went back and checked

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
Tati's original deleted video,

61
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,320
and she actually never uses the phrase

62
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,320
sexual predator.

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
It's funny, I remember her calling him that

64
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,320
because that became the story on Twitter.

65
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
But what she actually said was

66
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,320
James had tried to trick straight men

67
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
into thinking they're gay.

68
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,320
Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,320
into thinking he's gay yet again.

70
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator.

71
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,320
But see, this is what cancel culture does.

72
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,320
It takes one story and transforms it

73
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,320
into a significantly different story.

74
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,320
You know, the headline I would write

75
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,320
about the James and Tati story might read

76
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,320
Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles

77
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,320
of trying to trick straight men

78
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,320
into thinking they're gay.

79
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,320
But cancel culture transforms that story

80
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,320
into the headline,

81
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,320
James Charles is a sexual predator.

82
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,320
Interesting.

83
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,320
Now, I want to make it clear that my intention here

84
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,320
is really not to defend James Charles.

85
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
I'm not a James Charles stan.

86
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm a biological female in my 30s.

87
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Close to death, I know.

88
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
Please leave a comment before I die.

89
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,320
That said, I do think the statement

90
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,320
James Charles is a sexual predator

91
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,320
is a stretch, to say the least.

92
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
At least, based on the information I have

93
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
in December 2019.

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,320
So let's analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens.

95
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Cancel culture trope one.

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
And you should be writing this down, class,

97
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
because this will be on the test.

98
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,320
Cancel culture trope one.

99
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,320
Presumption of guilt.

100
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,320
There's a traditional understanding of justice

101
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,320
according to which,

102
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,320
before you condemn or punish a person,

103
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,320
you hear the accuser's side of the story

104
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,320
and the accused's side of the story.

105
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
You allow both sides to present evidence

106
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,320
and only after everyone involved

107
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,320
has had a chance to make their case

108
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,320
do you pass sentence and punish the convict.

109
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
Aww. Punish me, King.

110
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Drinking this is punishment enough.

111
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
Am I uncanceled yet, please?

112
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
In the United States,

113
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
we legally have the presumption of innocence.

114
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,320
But canceling does not abide by the law.

115
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,320
Canceling is a form of vigilante mob justice.

116
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:24,320
And a lot of times, an accusation is proof enough.

117
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,320
Now, that's basically the point

118
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
of the progressive slogan,

119
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
believe victims.

120
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,320
It's a norm that was put into place in progressive spaces

121
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,320
because out in the world at large,

122
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,320
people generally don't believe victims.

123
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,320
But I think it's pretty obvious

124
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,320
how believe victims

125
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
is a norm that's easy to abuse.

126
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,320
Was Tati really James' victim?

127
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,320
No.

128
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
She's not some powerless woman

129
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
abused by a prominent man in her industry.

130
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,320
She's on top of the industry.

131
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,320
And she wasn't victimized by James at all.

132
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,320
I see this case more as she weaponized

133
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:00,320
cancel culture against a business rival.

134
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,320
Anyway, before James had even had a chance

135
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,320
to respond to Tati's accusation,

136
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,320
the story had already gone from

137
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,320
Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles

138
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,320
of trying to trick straight men

139
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,320
to James Charles tried to trick straight men.

140
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,320
And from there, it was generalized into

141
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
James Charles is toxic and manipulative.

142
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Which brings us to cancel culture trope two,

143
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
abstraction.

144
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
Abstraction replaces the specific,

145
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
concrete details of a claim

146
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
with a more generic statement.

147
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
In the transition from Tati Westbrook

148
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,320
accused James Charles of trying to trick straight men

149
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:37,320
to James Charles is toxic and manipulative,

150
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,320
we've lost not only the sense of this behavior,

151
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,320
being an unverified accusation,

152
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,320
but we've also lost all the specific details.

153
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,320
James Charles is toxic and manipulative

154
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,320
is an incredibly vague statement.

155
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:52,320
It may as well be James Charles is bad.

156
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,320
But even without the presumption of guilt,

157
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,320
if someone tells me James Charles is accused

158
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,320
of toxic and manipulative behavior,

159
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,320
I'm gonna think, oh, that sounds pretty bad.

160
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
And I'm gonna start speculating about the specifics.

161
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
And whatever my imagination comes up with

162
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,320
is likely going to be worse

163
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,320
than whatever he's actually accused of.

164
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Also, the specific accusation

165
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
that he tried to trick straight men

166
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,320
into thinking they're gay

167
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,320
is self-evidently kind of questionable.

168
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,320
How do you trick straight men into thinking they're gay?

169
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,320
If you find out, let me know.

170
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,320
It's bad. I'm bad. I'm super bad.

171
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
This is not a problem that straight men

172
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,320
usually seem to have.

173
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,320
At the very least, it requires further explanation.

174
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,320
It's the kind of story that sounds like

175
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
it has more than one side.

176
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm not gonna be gonna feel a little bit skeptical

177
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
of the accusation.

178
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,320
And I'm also gonna side-eye Tati Westbrook

179
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,320
because this accusation is setting off

180
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,320
my homophobia detection alarm.

181
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
Leave the gays alone.

182
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
But I'm not gonna have an opportunity

183
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
to pick up on the potential homophobia

184
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
and be skeptical of it

185
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,320
if all I've heard about the situation

186
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
is James Charles is toxic and manipulative.

187
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
And I also wanna point out

188
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,320
a linguistic shift that's happening here.

189
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,320
When the claim was James Charles tried

190
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,320
to trick straight men,

191
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,320
the verbs in the sentence were try and trick.

192
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,320
So what we're criticizing here is James' behavior.

193
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,320
We're criticizing things he did, allegedly,

194
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
trying to trick straight men.

195
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
But once the claim morphs into James Charles

196
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
is toxic and manipulative,

197
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,320
the verb in the sentence is is, to be.

198
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
So these adjectives are characteristics of James,

199
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
and it's now not his actions we're criticizing

200
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,320
but his personality, his toxicity,

201
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
his manipulativeness.

202
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
And this is what I'll call

203
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Cancel Culture Trope 3, essentialism.

204
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Essentialism is when we go

205
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
from criticizing a person's actions

206
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,320
to criticizing the person themselves.

207
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
We're not just saying they did bad things,

208
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
we're saying they're a bad person.

209
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
And that's what takes us from

210
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
James Charles tried to trick straight men

211
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,320
to James Charles is a sexual predator.

212
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
So here we're targeting James himself,

213
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
not just his actions,

214
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
but the type of person he is.

215
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
A sexual predator.

216
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
And we've also really escalated the accusation.

217
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Because I don't know about you guys,

218
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
but when I hear the phrase sexual predator,

219
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
the image that comes to mind is

220
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
a rapist or a child molester,

221
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,320
maybe an abusive boss?

222
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,320
Not a teenage twink hung up

223
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,320
on wanting to date straight guys.

224
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,320
I mean, not that a person like that

225
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
couldn't be a sexual predator,

226
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,320
but I really don't think that he's a sexual predator

227
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
is a fair summary of the accusation.

228
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
So this seems to me like a pretty nasty

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
and dishonest twisting of the story.

230
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
And it happened instantaneously on Twitter.

231
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
It totally dominated the conversation

232
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
in a community of millions of people

233
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
for weeks.

234
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,320
In a few days,

235
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
James had lost millions of subscribers,

236
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
and who knows what effect it had on his personal life.

237
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
Not that anyone seems to care.

238
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,320
In fact, most people seemed to be enjoying his downfall.

239
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
He was a teenage millionaire,

240
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,320
a young, beautiful superstar.

241
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Easy to envy, easy to resent,

242
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,320
hard to relate to, hard to sympathize with.

243
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
What was the point of canceling James Charles?

244
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Did we want to teach him a lesson?

245
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Did we want him to learn from his mistakes

246
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
and grow as a person?

247
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Imagine actually wanting someone to learn.

248
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Imagine actually caring.

249
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,320
My hunch is that the average YouTube viewer

250
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
was not sincerely outraged and hurt

251
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,320
by their sincere belief that James Charles

252
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
was a sexual predator.

253
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,320
In other words, this was not a case of triggered SJWs.

254
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
This was a controversy manufactured from the top

255
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,320
by a handful of seemingly vindictive and envious people.

256
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
I honestly think that most of the

257
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
James Charles is a sexual predator crowd

258
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,320
just wanted to bring him down a peg.

259
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,320
Cancel culture trope four.

260
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,320
Pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism.

261
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
If you look at the world we live in,

262
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,320
would you say that people are usually motivated

263
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,320
by a sense of moral integrity and intellectual rigor?

264
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
No, maybe not.

265
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
Let's be real, America.

266
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,320
We are a bunch of morally impotent meatbags

267
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,320
constantly shitting ourselves out of fear and lust.

268
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,320
For Tati, calling out James, this was really,

269
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,320
it was about the hair vitamins, right?

270
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,320
I think sis was super salty that this millionaire kid

271
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
who she had supported and helped

272
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,320
had betrayed her by endorsing a rival brand.

273
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,320
And accusing him of trying to trick straight men

274
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
was just a twist of the knife.

275
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
But moralism or intellectualism

276
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
provide a phony pretext for the call out.

277
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
You can pretend you just want an apology.

278
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
You can pretend you're just a concerned citizen

279
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,320
who wants the person to improve.

280
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
You can pretend you're simply offering up criticism

281
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
when what you're really doing

282
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
is attacking a person's career and reputation

283
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
out of spite, envy, revenge.

284
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
I mean, it could be any motivation.

285
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
Twitter viewed James as an overprivileged,

286
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
spoiled little brat

287
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,320
and it was fun to wipe the smile off his smug face

288
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
at least for a few weeks.

289
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
It's schadenfreude, right?

290
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
This kind of petty sadism.

291
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
Maybe not the internet's proudest moment,

292
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
but not the most shameful either.

293
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
And it's not to say that everyone cancelling James Charles

294
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,320
was insincere.

295
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
But there's a world of difference

296
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
between Cancel R. Kelly

297
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
and Cancel James Charles.

298
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
And I'm interested to know

299
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,320
how these two things came to look the same.

300
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,320
When James was being cancelled,

301
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
I remember being kind of transfixed

302
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
by the sight of his life and career

303
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
falling from the sky,

304
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:26,320
full tailspin, black smoke spewing out.

305
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
And a lot of my YouTube friends were like,

306
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
lol, did you see James Charles is cancelled?

307
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
lolololololol.

308
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
But I looked up at James and I said,

309
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,320
oh god, that's gonna be me someday.

310
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
Stay strong, sister.

311
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,320
Don't let the bastards get you down.

312
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Let's switch over to White Claw.

313
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
These are cute, these are fun.

314
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
A little more of a feminine moment for me.

315
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:52,320
They didn't even have these last time I was an alcoholic.

316
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
I'm not even wearing makeup.

317
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,320
I don't need makeup to serve a full biological fantasy.

318
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,320
Keep drinking, people.

319
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
We're gonna make it through this together.

320
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,320
So I was doing a little Twitter archaeology

321
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,320
when I was looking into the James Charles cancelling,

322
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
and I found a bunch of tweets

323
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,320
referencing earlier James Charles scandals.

324
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,320
Y'all forgiving James Charles?

325
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
He's still a transphobe.

326
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,320
Y'all are acting like just because James Charles has receipts,

327
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
he's no longer a racist transphobe.

328
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,320
Like, James Charles is racist, ableist, transphobic,

329
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
and a sexual predator.

330
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
A white woman.

331
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Y'all are being too harsh on him and he's uncancelled.

332
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
So according to Twitter,

333
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,320
James Charles is not only a sexual predator,

334
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,320
he's also a racist and a transphobe.

335
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
That sounds pretty serious.

336
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Let's investigate.

337
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
We'll start with the transphobia allocation.

338
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
Cockerels of the jury.

339
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Exhibit A.

340
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:47,320
So you're not even full gay.

341
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
I mean, no, there have been girls in the past that I've, like,

342
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
thought were really, really beautiful.

343
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,320
There's also been, like, trans guys in the past, too,

344
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,320
that I was, like, really, really into for a moment in time.

345
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,320
And I oop.

346
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,320
As they say on Twitter,

347
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
yikes.

348
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,320
This ain't it, chief.

349
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

350
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
Maybe don't be transphobic.

351
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Disappointing.

352
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,320
So James did, uh, fuck up here.

353
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
The problem is he's suggesting that being attracted to trans men

354
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,320
makes him less gay,

355
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,320
which implies that trans men aren't really men,

356
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,320
which is at odds with the way trans men understand themselves.

357
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,320
So this does deserve criticism.

358
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
No doubt, no doubt.

359
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,320
However, what I see when I look at this clip of James

360
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
is not

361
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,320
a dyed-in-the-wool transphobic bigot.

362
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I see a very young person

363
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,320
who's still working on understanding his own sexuality

364
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
and is trying to figure out

365
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
where his attraction to trans men fits into that.

366
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,320
And it seems to me that the proportionate response to that situation

367
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,320
is for someone to take James aside

368
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,320
and explain to him,

369
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,320
look, here's why what you said is hurtful to trans men,

370
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,320
and here are some tips on how to avoid saying that kind of thing in the future.

371
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:01,320
You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred.

372
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:05,320
Not understanding someone is not the same as wanting them dead.

373
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Of course, there are committed bigots

374
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
who it's just a waste of time to engage with.

375
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,320
But sometimes just talking to someone

376
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,320
with a little patience and understanding is all it takes.

377
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
But that's not what cancel culture does.

378
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Oh no, we have to immediately escalate every situation

379
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,320
to the highest possible level of conflict.

380
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,320
So by abstraction,

381
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,320
we get James Charles made transphobic comments.

382
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
And by essentialism, we get

383
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,320
James Charles is a transphobe.

384
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
We don't give him a chance to reflect.

385
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
We don't give him an opportunity to learn.

386
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:41,320
We go straight to branding him a bigot.

387
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
Nonetheless, that same week,

388
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,320
James posted an apology to his Insta story saying,

389
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
Regardless of whatever my intentions were,

390
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
that came across as me saying

391
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:53,320
I'm not fully gay because I have been with a trans man

392
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,320
and that is absolutely,

393
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
first of all, not true.

394
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
Like that doesn't make me not fully gay.

395
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
But that stereotype and implication

396
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
is really, really dangerous.

397
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
And I'm very, very sorry.

398
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
If you are a trans man, you are a man.

399
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
If you're a trans girl, you are a woman.

400
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
You are valid in your identity.

401
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
Could you ask for a better apology?

402
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,320
Like he not only apologizes for what he said,

403
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
but he also demonstrates a clear understanding

404
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
of why it was wrong.

405
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:23,320
So does that mean people stopped calling him a transphobe?

406
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Of course not.

407
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,320
Cancel culture trope five, no forgiveness.

408
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,320
Cancelers will often dismiss an apology as insincere,

409
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
no matter how convincingly written or delivered.

410
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,320
And of course, an insincere apology is further proof

411
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,320
of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.

412
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
Now, sometimes a good apology

413
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
will calm things down for a while.

414
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
But the next time there's a scandal,

415
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,320
the original accusation will be raised again,

416
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
as if you never apologized.

417
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
That's what happened to James during the Tati scandal,

418
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,320
when Twitter decided he was a transphobic sexual predator.

419
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
And that's to say nothing of this racism

420
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
I've been hearing about.

421
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Here's the receipts.

422
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Exhibit B.

423
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
In February 2017,

424
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
when James was much less famous than he is now,

425
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,320
he tweeted,

426
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
I can't believe we're going to Africa today.

427
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
OMG, what if we get Ebola?

428
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,320
James, we're fine.

429
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,320
We could have gotten it at Chipotle last year.

430
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,320
Okay, well, that's a little insensitive, maybe.

431
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
It's not really something an influencer should tweet.

432
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,320
And fear of disease associated with Africa.

433
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:32,320
I mean, I can see how it's in the same vague conceptual area

434
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
as certain racist tropes.

435
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,320
But clearly, this was intended as a joke

436
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,320
about his friend mistaking Ebola for E. coli, right?

437
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,320
And anyway, he did apologize, saying,

438
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
As a white cis male,

439
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,320
I recognize my privilege

440
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,320
and would never want to take that for granted.

441
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
But I fucked up.

442
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
I feel awful for posting what I said.

443
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,320
I understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant.

444
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,320
And James hasn't made a habit of making jokes like that ever since.

445
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
So...

446
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Is this one tweet from two years ago

447
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,320
that he apologized for

448
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
on its own enough evidence

449
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
for us to justify labeling him

450
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
a racist?

451
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Well, according to cancel culture, absolutely.

452
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Abstraction takes us from

453
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Two years ago, James Charles made a joke

454
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,320
that referenced his fear of getting Ebola in Africa

455
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,320
to James Charles made a racist joke.

456
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,320
And then essentialism takes us to

457
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,320
James Charles is a racist.

458
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Look, I want to pause to say

459
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,320
I really do believe in social justice.

460
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,320
At least, as much as trash like me believes in anything.

461
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,320
And believe me, I am well aware

462
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,320
that jokes, irony, and even complaints about cancel culture

463
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,320
are often used by bigots to cloak their real agenda.

464
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,320
The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video

465
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,320
about how far-right racists use jokes and memes

466
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
and mockery of SJWs

467
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,320
as a way to camouflage their hateful beliefs

468
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
and make them more palatable to a wider audience.

469
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:10,320
So I'm coming at this from a place of genuine concern

470
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,320
for anti-racism and anti-transphobia

471
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
as well as an awareness of the fact

472
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,320
that cancel culture is often just

473
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,320
a conservative red herring used to shut down

474
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,320
any and all complaints about racism or transphobia.

475
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,320
But I've also become very disillusioned

476
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:29,320
with the way these accusations are thrown around

477
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,320
so frivolously on social media.

478
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,320
By the way, they're used to escalate conflict

479
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,320
instead of promote understanding.

480
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,320
And by the way, they're sometimes weaponized

481
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,320
to destroy people who have made mistakes

482
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:46,320
but who really don't deserve to be destroyed.

483
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320
Now maybe you're thinking,

484
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,320
destroyed? What do you mean destroyed?

485
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,320
James is a 20-year-old millionaire

486
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,320
on his way to owning his own makeup empire.

487
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,320
And you are completely correct.

488
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,320
If you're James Charles, if you're a superstar,

489
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,320
then being canceled most likely does not destroy you.

490
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:07,320
The cancelers blend in to the general backdrop of haters

491
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:10,320
and they can set you back a few million subscribers

492
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
and a lot of emotional turmoil,

493
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
but in the long run, they can't really touch your success.

494
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,320
But here's the thing.

495
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,320
What if you're not James Charles?

496
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,320
What if you're a small creator?

497
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,320
What if you can't afford public relations help?

498
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
What if you belong to a marginalized community

499
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,320
and you rely on that community for support?

500
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Well, in that case, it's a whole different story.

501
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,320
Let's Irish up this coffee.

502
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Shaken, not stirred.

503
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Spilled it over my pussy.

504
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Mmm, that's good.

505
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Booze and coffee is a good combination.

506
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I'm feeling amped right now.

507
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
I'm feeling hype.

508
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
So this is the part in the video where I should admit

509
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
that I'm not just a casual observer here.

510
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
At the time I'm making this video,

511
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,320
sweaty,

512
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm super canceled.

513
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
You know, I try to make videos that are both informative and entertaining.

514
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
So in this video, the information is

515
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
you get to learn about cancel culture

516
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,320
and the entertainment is

517
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
you get to watch a worm try to wriggle off a hook.

518
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
Let's get started.

519
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

520
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Hey, how are you?

521
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,320
God, I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber

522
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,320
who would resort to making videos about my own drama,

523
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,320
but things have gotten to a point.

524
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,320
I feel like I cannot continue this channel

525
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
until I spill some tea.

526
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
So let's get started.

527
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Okay, first, a little backstory, a little mise-en-scene.

528
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,320
I've never talked about this on my channel before,

529
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,320
so this is a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.

530
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
But I am, in fact, a transgender woman,

531
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,320
which may come as a big shock to many of you

532
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,320
since I'm 100% real fesh.

533
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,320
I get comments all the time from very solemn people like,

534
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:49,320
guys, I'm pretty sure this is a dude.

535
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Great work, detective.

536
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,320
You cracked the case.

537
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,320
You're doing very good, sweetie.

538
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,320
Very, very good.

539
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:58,320
But yes, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transgenders,

540
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,320
I am a prime target for cancellation,

541
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:04,320
and I have been canceled many, many times.

542
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,320
And we're gonna talk about some of the things

543
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,320
I've been canceled for

544
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320
and some of the things I've been criticized for

545
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,320
and the difference between criticism and canceling.

546
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,320
Because yes, there is a difference.

547
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
As we go along,

548
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,320
I will admit where I have made mistakes

549
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,320
because despite how I look,

550
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320
I am not a literal goddess,

551
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,320
and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due.

552
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,320
However, where I believe that criticism of me

553
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
is excessive or unwarranted,

554
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
I will not apologize

555
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,320
because here at ContraPoints Industries,

556
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,320
we are not in the business of serving bullshit.

557
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,320
So, the reason for my current cancellation is,

558
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,320
in summary, that in my last video, Opulence,

559
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I cast transsexual violence

560
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
on the beautiful porn star Buck Angel

561
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,320
in the role of John Waters.

562
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
And yes, it's a much better story

563
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,320
than the hair vitamin debacle,

564
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
so notify the drama channels,

565
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
put in a good word for me,

566
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,320
because, sweetie,

567
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
I'm not here to make friends.

568
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,320
I'm here to win.

569
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
So basically, I'm canceled

570
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
for collaborating with Buck Angel,

571
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
and a lot of trans people think

572
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,320
Buck Angel is a horrible person.

573
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320
And so my collaboration with Buck Angel

574
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:05,320
is evidence that I, too,

575
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,320
am a horrible person.

576
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Cancel culture trope six,

577
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,320
the transitive property of cancellation.

578
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,320
Cancellation is infectious.

579
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
If you associate with a canceled person,

580
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
the cancellation rubs off.

581
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,320
It's like gonorrhea,

582
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,320
except doxycycline won't save you this time, sweetie.

583
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all,

584
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,320
on whether Buck Angel is, in fact,

585
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,320
a horrible person.

586
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,320
So who is Buck Angel?

587
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Well, he's a trans man of my parents' generation.

588
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,320
He grew up in a world

589
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
where there was not anything like the visibility

590
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
and access to information about transition we have today,

591
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
and where there was a strict medical gatekeeping system

592
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,320
in place for people who wanted to transition.

593
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,320
In fact, Buck was the first female-to-male patient

594
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,320
his doctor had ever treated.

595
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,320
In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer,

596
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,320
his gimmick at the time being the man with the pussy.

597
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,320
But he also became an activist.

598
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
He wanted to create more positive trans representation

599
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
within the porn world.

600
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,320
And from there, he became a more general educator

601
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:01,320
and advocate for trans people.

602
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,320
I first heard about him in the early 2010s

603
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
when I was doing some Googling

604
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,320
about some little gender issues I was having myself,

605
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
although I ended up deciding to remain a female.

606
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
And Buck was one of the first female-to-male people

607
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
I'd ever heard about.

608
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
And he made an impact on me,

609
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,320
in part because you take one look at him and you think,

610
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,320
honey, that's a man.

611
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,320
But he was born a woman.

612
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,320
You can do that.

613
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:24,320
So it's not that he inspired me to transition or anything,

614
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:26,320
it's just, it was one of many moments

615
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
along my whole entire gender journey.

616
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:29,320
So I had positive feelings about Tran-pa,

617
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
that's what he calls himself,

618
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,320
from back then.

619
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,320
And then a few months ago,

620
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,320
when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised

621
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,320
over another time I was being canceled by trans Twitter,

622
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
we'll get to that one later,

623
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,320
I saw this post from Buck on Instagram.

624
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
And those were exactly the words I needed to hear

625
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
at that moment.

626
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,320
So I commented a heart and then Buck DMed me

627
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
and he said, I love you.

628
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
And I was like,

629
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
senpai noticed me.

630
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
And so I said, I love you back.

631
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Then when I was working on Opulence,

632
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,320
I needed a voice actor to do a line from John Waters' book.

633
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:28,320
And it was my co-director Theron who suggested,

634
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
don't you think Buck Angel sounds kind of like John Waters?

635
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
And I said, well, he just messaged me on Insta,

636
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
let's see if he wants to do it.

637
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,320
And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel

638
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
as John Waters in the video credits,

639
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,320
like a trans icon playing a gay icon.

640
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:45,320
In my head it was just so, well, iconic.

641
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
So I got in touch with Buck about the line

642
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,320
and he was like, yeah, I'd love to do it.

643
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,320
So here it is,

644
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,320
the 10 second voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life.

645
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,320
One must remember,

646
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:58,320
there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.

647
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,320
To understand bad taste,

648
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,320
one must have very good taste.

649
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,320
That's it children.

650
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
That's why mommy's canceled.

651
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,320
Now I was aware at the time

652
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
that trans Twitter hate

653
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,320
and hated Buck Angel,

654
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
but my thinking was,

655
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,320
well, trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity

656
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
and they certainly hate me.

657
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,320
So I wasn't going to let that stop me.

658
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
Little did I know,

659
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,320
quite how vicious things were about to get.

660
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,320
Now, so far I've been telling this story

661
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
from my point of view,

662
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:26,320
but I do want to give a fair and balanced account.

663
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,320
So I want to pause and contextualize

664
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,320
why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much,

665
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,320
they're willing to cancel anyone who even associates with him.

666
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
Basically it all goes back to this old debate

667
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,320
in the trans community known today

668
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:41,320
and Tumblr lingo as true scum versus trans trenders.

669
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
So true scum are trans people

670
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
who distinguish between true trans people

671
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,320
and fake trans people,

672
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
who they call trenders or too-cutes.

673
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,320
Usually true scum think that what it is to be trans

674
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,320
is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria,

675
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,320
to pursue a medical transition involving hormones and surgery,

676
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,320
and to socially re-assimilate into your target binary gender,

677
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:01,320
so male or female.

678
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Anyone who's not that,

679
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,320
according to true scum,

680
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,320
must either be a confused teenager,

681
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
someone just trying to get attention,

682
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,320
someone mistaking their trauma or their fetish for being trans,

683
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,320
in a word, a trender.

684
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,320
So that's a vige of transness

685
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
that usually excludes non-binary people

686
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
as well as people who don't want to medically transition

687
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
for whatever reason,

688
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,320
and for that reason this view is sometimes also called

689
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,320
transmedicalism.

690
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,320
True scum obviously being the derogatory term for these people.

691
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
So true scum are very hated by a lot of trans people

692
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,320
because their viewpoint is that not all trans identities are valid,

693
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,320
and Buck Angel is widely perceived to be true scum.

694
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,320
So the next question to ask is,

695
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
is this true?

696
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Is Buck Angel in fact true scum?

697
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,320
Now my honest answer to that question is,

698
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
I don't know.

699
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,320
He's certainly said some things that sound like things true scum say,

700
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,320
I'll give you that.

701
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,320
A point he likes to make a lot is that he's transsexual,

702
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,320
not transgender.

703
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,320
And the difference between those terms is sometimes defined as

704
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,320
transsexual implies that you want to pursue medical transition,

705
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,320
so hormones and surgery,

706
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
and transgender doesn't imply that.

707
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
And people associate this,

708
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,320
I'm transsexual not transgender thing with true scum

709
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,320
because true scum often call themselves transsexuals

710
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,320
and say that anyone who isn't a transsexual isn't really trans.

711
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,320
And often those people will be very mean to people they call trenders,

712
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,320
especially certain transmedicalist YouTubers like

713
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Vanessa LeBlanc and Too Cute Smasher 9000.

714
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Too Cute Smasher 9000.

715
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Roast me back Calvin, I dare you.

716
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:36,320
But I think it's important to keep in mind that the term true scum

717
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,320
is a product of the 2014 Tumblr wars,

718
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,320
and trying to apply it to trans people of an older generation

719
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,320
can sometimes be misleading.

720
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
Like when Buck Angel transitioned,

721
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,320
the word transsexual was just the word for his identity,

722
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,320
and he still identifies that way.

723
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,320
So when younger trans people tell him it's wrong to use the word transsexual,

724
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:57,320
he feels like these ungrateful millennials are invalidating his identity.

725
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,320
And I do understand where he's coming from,

726
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,320
but I also understand why a lot of nonbinary people

727
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
are skeptical about Buck.

728
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Like he says again and again,

729
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,320
I'm transsexual, not transgender,

730
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,320
like don't mix me up with those people.

731
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,320
And that eagerness to separate himself from transgender people,

732
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
it comes across as hostility.

733
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,320
Like I don't think he's ever actually said that nonbinary people aren't valid,

734
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,320
but I personally don't like that he seems like he wants to distance himself from them.

735
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,320
And that's my disagreement with Buck.

736
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,320
It's not that he invalidates nonbinary identities,

737
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
because I don't really care.

738
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,320
I don't really see him doing that.

739
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,320
And if he was doing that,

740
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,320
I would have seen it.

741
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,320
Because for the last two months,

742
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,320
a lot of people have been doing nothing but sending me problematic Buck Angel tweets.

743
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,320
But as someone who cares a lot about nonbinary people,

744
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,320
and who loves the nonbinary people in my life,

745
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,320
it does upset me when he does this distancing thing.

746
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,320
And I hope he listens to this criticism,

747
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,320
because I think it would be cool if he got better about this.

748
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,320
Of course, Buck is technically right that there are different kinds of trans people.

749
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:56,320
And I agree it's important that we can make those distinctions

750
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
and talk about the differences when they're relevant,

751
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,320
but I also think that as a community,

752
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,320
trans people benefit from unity,

753
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,320
not division.

754
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Like if you have an employer who discriminates against trans people,

755
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,320
they're not going to care if you're transsexual,

756
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:09,320
transgender,

757
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,320
nonbinary,

758
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,320
or gender nonconforming.

759
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,320
They're going to discriminate against you regardless.

760
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,320
So we're all in this together.

761
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,320
And there's a lot of disagreements among us,

762
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,320
and we often don't get along so well.

763
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
But politically,

764
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,320
I think we should work together as much as possible

765
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
instead of splitting into little factions,

766
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,320
because we share most of the same interests.

767
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,320
And I think the best way to do that

768
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
is to build bridges instead of burning them.

769
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,320
And that's why I'm willing to work with people like Buck Angel,

770
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
who I have some disagreements with.

771
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,320
It creates a connection, you know?

772
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,320
And having that connection can lead to communication

773
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,320
and build understanding.

774
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:43,320
Also, I need all the connections I can get, Gorge.

775
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
I am very lonely.

776
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,320
It's not a joke.

777
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,320
It's true.

778
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,320
Now I get that some people have views that are so harmful

779
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,320
that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous.

780
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,320
But in any case,

781
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,320
I didn't even give Buck a platform to share his opinions.

782
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,320
I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator.

783
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,320
A bunch of people on my subreddit were like,

784
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:04,320
why couldn't she just get John Waters to do those lines?

785
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,320
Well, first of all,

786
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,320
I don't actually know John,

787
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
but I just have a feeling he would write me off

788
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,320
as some kind of millennial SJW.

789
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,320
Like, why is Buck Angel canceled,

790
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320
but John Waters isn't?

791
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,320
Well, because trans Twitter does not know who John Waters is.

792
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,320
And let's try to keep it that way.

793
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,320
I actually mentioned this to a friend of mine who knows John,

794
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,320
and he told me that he and John

795
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:25,320
have actually watched Buck Angel's porn together.

796
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:28,320
So, plot twist.

797
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:31,320
Okay, so trans Twitter won't forgive me

798
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,320
unless I condemn Buck Angel as true scum

799
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
and apologize for ever working with him.

800
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
But I'm not going to do that,

801
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,320
because I don't think it would be the right thing to do.

802
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,320
And doing it just to get myself uncancelled

803
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,320
would be cowardly.

804
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,320
I'm happy to tell you I absolutely disagree

805
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:47,320
with Buck's divisive rhetoric

806
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,320
about transsexual versus transgender.

807
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,320
I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender umbrella

808
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,320
instead of trying to distance himself from the rest.

809
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,320
And I'm happy to hear out the perspective of nonbinary people

810
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,320
who don't trust him,

811
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
because I totally get where they're coming from

812
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,320
and I think that's valid.

813
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:04,320
But I also respect the decades of good activism

814
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Buck Angel has done for trans people,

815
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,320
and I am grateful to him for that.

816
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,320
And in light of that,

817
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,320
I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt

818
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,320
about where his heart is,

819
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,320
and express my criticism in a more measured way

820
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
than just attacking who he is as a person.

821
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,320
But Twitter needs to establish that he's a horrible person,

822
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,320
because this is the strategy they've chosen to use

823
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,320
to establish that I am a horrible person.

824
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:30,320
And if the true scum allegation isn't strong enough to prove it,

825
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320
oh they have other pieces of evidence to fall back on

826
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
to hold up their conclusion.

827
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:36,320
For example, here's a tweet claiming

828
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,320
Natalie's trying so fucking hard

829
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,320
to make it sound like the only thing Buck Angel ever did

830
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,320
was write a few iffy tweets,

831
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,320
and that's just so fucking far from the truth.

832
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,320
Dude launched a targeted tabloid harassment campaign

833
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
outing a trans woman against her will

834
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,320
with the specific intent of causing her physical, emotional,

835
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,320
and professional harm.

836
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,320
The shorter way of saying that

837
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
is that he wanted to make her suffer,

838
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,320
and she very well could have been killed.

839
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,320
Yikes.

840
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,320
This ain't it, chief.

841
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,320
Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.

842
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
Maybe don't try to get trans women killed.

843
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,320
Disappointing.

844
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,320
It sounds pretty serious.

845
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,320
Let's investigate.

846
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
Here's what I've managed to piece together.

847
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,320
Scene one.

848
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,320
The year is 2003.

849
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,320
Los Angeles,

850
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,320
where the movie world,

851
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,320
the porn world,

852
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
and the BDSM scene come together

853
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
in a tale of heartbreak,

854
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
betrayal,

855
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,320
and transsexualism.

856
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
La La Land.

857
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Dramatis Personae.

858
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,320
Buck Angel,

859
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
transsexual porn star.

860
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Ilsa Strix,

861
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,320
dominatrix,

862
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,320
then wife of Buck Angel.

863
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,320
Lana Wachowski,

864
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:36,320
wildly successful director of The Matrix,

865
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,320
at the time not yet out as a transgender woman.

866
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,320
The synopsis is that Ilsa Strix and Buck Angel's marriage ended

867
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,320
after Ilsa had an affair with Lana Wachowski,

868
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,320
who was not yet out as trans.

869
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,320
So Buck was understandably upset about the affair,

870
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,320
and in what seems like a petty act of revenge,

871
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,320
told a series of magazines

872
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,320
that this celebrity director Wachowski

873
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:58,320
was a cross-dresser who had stolen his wife,

874
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,320
which I guess was the information he had at the time.

875
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,320
So is that outing a trans woman against her will?

876
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,320
Well in retrospect it seems like it,

877
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,320
though that may not be what he thought he was doing at the time.

878
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,320
But to really get to the bottom of this,

879
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,320
we have to do some digging.

880
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,320
We have to trawl through the dirty details

881
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
of trans people's personal histories,

882
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,320
which I've noticed is one of the internet's favorite activities.

883
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
So I actually went on eBay

884
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,320
and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991 January 2006,

885
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:29,320
and I'm finally able to reveal

886
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
that the seller cancelled the order.

887
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
God damn it!

888
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,320
But I was finally able to track down and translate

889
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,320
a Spanish version of the Rolling Stone article

890
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
from the Wayback Machine,

891
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:45,320
and I'm finally able to expose the truth.

892
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Stop.

893
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Freeze exactly where you are.

894
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
Take a look at yourself

895
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,320
and what all of us have been doing

896
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,320
for the last 30 seconds.

897
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
Who does this behavior remind you of?

898
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
If your answer is social justice advocates

899
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
fighting for trans equality,

900
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
you are incorrect.

901
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,320
If your answer is creepy stalkers who hate trans people,

902
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
I am very suspicious of anyone

903
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,320
whose online behavior prompts me

904
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,320
to dig through articles full of dead names

905
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
and sordid scandals involving trans people

906
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,320
from almost two decades ago.

907
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,320
This is very similar to techniques

908
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,320
used against trans people by internet fascists.

909
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
So I'm pretty suspicious of anyone

910
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
pushing this kind of investigation.

911
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,320
How can you tell the difference

912
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
between a trans anarcho-socialist

913
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,320
with an anime avatar

914
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
and a Nazi pretending to be

915
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,320
a trans anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar?

916
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,320
Well, you can't.

917
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,320
Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous,

918
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
whether it's on 4chan or Twitter.

919
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
So unless Buck Angel, Ilsa Strix,

920
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,320
or Lana Wachowski gets in touch with me

921
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:46,320
and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason

922
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
they want me to publicly dig up

923
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
their 17-year-old divorce drama,

924
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,320
this is none of my fucking business.

925
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
And it's none of yours either,

926
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,320
so shut up and go back to Kiwi Farms

927
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,320
where you belong.

928
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
Let's Irish up this tea.

929
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,320
Doesn't work as well with tea.

930
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,320
So, setting aside any tabloid drama

931
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,320
that may have happened during the Bush administration,

932
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I'm saying this in the cuntiest way,

933
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,320
and they deserve it.

934
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,320
They fucking deserve the cuntiness.

935
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:31,320
I'm spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bathroom.

936
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,320
I'm a lady.

937
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,320
She's a woman.

938
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,320
The main argument against me

939
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,320
usually references a collage

940
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,320
of Buck Angel's problematic tweets.

941
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,320
And this is supposed to be definitive evidence

942
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
that he is a horrible person,

943
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,320
and therefore,

944
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,320
that I am a horrible person

945
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
for collaborating with him.

946
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,320
Well, here's the thing, though.

947
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,320
A collage of problematic tweets

948
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,320
does not define a person.

949
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,320
And I'm very used to being defined that way myself,

950
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,320
so I know how unfair it can be.

951
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,320
Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel,

952
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
a lot of people on Twitter

953
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
were already calling me truscum.

954
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
That's been going on a year and a half now.

955
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
And anytime my name comes up on Twitter,

956
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,320
a bunch of people respond saying

957
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Natalie is truscum,

958
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,320
Natalie is a transmedicalist,

959
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,320
Natalie hates nonbinary people,

960
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
and you should really think

961
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,320
what kind of message you're sending

962
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,320
to your trans and nonbinary followers

963
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,320
by platforming her.

964
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
And if the person defends me

965
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
or argues back in any way,

966
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
they say,

967
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,320
I can't believe you're ignoring

968
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,320
the valid concerns of marginalized people.

969
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,320
You know, they're weaponizing

970
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,320
their marginalized status as trans people

971
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,320
to isolate and attack

972
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
another trans person.

973
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,320
And sometimes this stuff gets to my head, too.

974
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,320
I start asking myself,

975
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,320
wait, am I a transmedicalist?

976
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,320
Do I really believe all these awful things

977
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
they say I believe?

978
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
But the answer is,

979
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,320
no.

980
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
I just don't.

981
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,320
These things they're saying about me

982
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
are 100% not true.

983
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,320
You know, believe marginalized people

984
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,320
is a norm that is encouraged

985
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,320
in leftist spaces for good reason,

986
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,320
much like believe victims

987
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,320
or believe women.

988
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
And these norms were established

989
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
to counterbalance the mainstream tendency,

990
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,320
which is not to listen

991
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,320
to marginalized people

992
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
or to victims

993
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
or to women.

994
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,320
But any norm can be abused.

995
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,320
And the blunt fact of the matter is,

996
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,320
sometimes marginalized people are wrong.

997
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Sometimes people calling themselves victims

998
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,320
are obscuring a more complicated situation.

999
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:24,320
And it's even happened once or twice

1000
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,320
that a woman has lied.

1001
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,320
And the accusation that I'm truscum

1002
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,320
is simply false.

1003
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,320
I mean, first of all,

1004
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:35,320
I don't even think of my own transgenderism

1005
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,320
as a medical disorder,

1006
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,320
much less everyone else's.

1007
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,320
I have, of course, collaborated with Dr. Spiegel

1008
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,320
at all,

1009
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,320
but I will not have my artistry

1010
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,320
reduced to mere medicine.

1011
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,320
Second,

1012
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,320
this accusation that I hate non-binary people

1013
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,320
is just...

1014
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,320
no.

1015
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Non.

1016
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,320
Eh...

1017
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,320
Non.

1018
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,320
My thinking about trans identity

1019
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,320
has always been informed by non-binary people.

1020
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,320
I used to identify as non-binary myself

1021
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,320
before I medically transitioned,

1022
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,320
and some of the closest people to me

1023
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,320
in my life today

1024
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,320
are non-binary trans people,

1025
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:11,320
some of whom are also transsexuals, incidentally.

1026
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
It's complicated.

1027
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,320
I've also made at least five videos on this channel

1028
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,320
arguing for the validity of non-binary gender identities

1029
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,320
going back more than three years.

1030
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,320
So that's five out of around 50 videos,

1031
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,320
or 10% of the content I've made on this channel,

1032
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
is about non-binary identity.

1033
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
A few months ago,

1034
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,320
I even made a 30-minute video called TransTrenders,

1035
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
which uses character dialogue to show

1036
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
what I think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism.

1037
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,320
But there's still hundreds of people on Twitter

1038
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:39,320
saying that I'm truscum who hates non-binary people.

1039
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,320
And their main piece of evidence for that

1040
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:44,320
is a collage of my problematic tweets.

1041
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,320
So let's take a look at that.

1042
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Here's the three tweets

1043
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,320
that I usually see scrapbooked together

1044
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,320
as definitive proof that I hate non-binary people.

1045
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,320
This is the first one,

1046
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
from September 2018.

1047
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Notice how it's taken out of context from the thread

1048
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,320
so you can't even see what I'm talking about.

1049
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,320
I'm sure this is not the experience of many NBs

1050
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
.

1051
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,320
I leave it to them to articulate

1052
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,320
what NB existence looks like in a binary world.

1053
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,320
I do not and I cannot speak for them.

1054
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,320
But surely N-

1055
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:13,320
God, I used to write like such a nerd.

1056
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
But surely N-

1057
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
The account that begins and ends

1058
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,320
with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

1059
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
is pretty weak.

1060
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread

1061
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,320
that that tweet has been clipped out of,

1062
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,320
I was defending myself from accusations

1063
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,320
that my most recent video at the time,

1064
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,320
The Aesthetic,

1065
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,320
was anti-non-binary.

1066
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
In that video,

1067
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,320
there's a character named Justine

1068
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:37,320
who defends a version of the performativity theory of gender.

1069
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,320
And basically I made this video

1070
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,320
to express some angst I was feeling

1071
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:43,320
about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye.

1072
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,320
This was a very one-year-on-hormones moment for me,

1073
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,320
and I've already moved on in my thinking.

1074
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,320
At that time I was very, um,

1075
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:53,320
my behavior must be perfectly feminine at all times

1076
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
or else I'm not really a woman.

1077
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:58,320
My self-esteem is totally based on sleeping with heterosexual men

1078
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
who resemble my father.

1079
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
And anyone who knows anything about trans women knows

1080
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,320
that most of us go through a stage like this at some point.

1081
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
And some YouTubers never get out of it.

1082
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,320
But personally, I mean these days,

1083
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,320
it doesn't matter what I wear.

1084
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:16,320
It's when I dream they're Lily's dreams.

1085
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,320
Dragging the Danish girl.

1086
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,320
Well, fuck the Danish.

1087
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,320
I could never abide that sort of person.

1088
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
We all know what I'm talking about.

1089
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,320
You can tell the whiskey is getting to me

1090
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:28,320
because I'm being bigoted against the Danish.

1091
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
These things come out, you know.

1092
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,320
You get honest, you get real

1093
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:35,320
when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system.

1094
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:39,320
Did I just fucking put lipstick outside the fucking lip liner?

1095
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
This is all Lily's fault.

1096
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
Lily Alba.

1097
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:43,320
Fuck her dreams.

1098
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:45,320
The point is, when I was making the aesthetic,

1099
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,320
I wasn't even thinking about non-binary people.

1100
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,320
And people will say that the fact that not every video I make

1101
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:54,320
references non-binary people is itself NB-phobic.

1102
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,320
As I've said, about one in ten of my videos

1103
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,320
is about non-binary identity.

1104
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,320
But not all of them are.

1105
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,320
And I feel entitled to make some videos

1106
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,320
that are just about trans women.

1107
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:09,320
But still, some people on Twitter were saying

1108
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,320
that the character Justine is a transmedicalist.

1109
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:17,320
And because she maybe wins the fictional debate in the video,

1110
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,320
I, Natalie Nguyen, am therefore a transmedicalist.

1111
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,320
Here's the thing, though.

1112
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,320
The performativity theory of gender,

1113
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,320
the one that Justine defends in that video,

1114
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:31,320
is conceptually as far away from transmedicalism

1115
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,320
as it is possible to be.

1116
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Transmedicalism says that trans identity is biological,

1117
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,320
it's neurological, it's hormonal,

1118
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,320
it's diagnosable and treatable.

1119
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:44,320
Whereas performativity says that gender is gesture,

1120
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,320
it's expression, it's performance,

1121
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,320
it's a social phenomenon.

1122
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:52,320
Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon.

1123
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,320
Phenomenon.

1124
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,320
Performativity makes no reference to gender dysphoria

1125
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:58,320
or to any kind of medical concept at all.

1126
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:02,320
So whereas transmedicalism is a kind of bioessentialism,

1127
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:05,320
performativity is a kind of social constructionism.

1128
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:08,320
So these are exact opposite theories of gender,

1129
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,320
are you following along, class?

1130
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
I'm not.

1131
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:14,320
I'm ready to drink Jameson tea until I die.

1132
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,320
But some trans people felt invalidated

1133
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,320
by things Justine says in that video.

1134
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:21,320
And transmedicalism is another thing

1135
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,320
that makes them feel invalidated.

1136
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,320
So they decided that Justine is a transmedicalist

1137
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:29,320
and therefore that I am a transmedicalist.

1138
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:32,320
And this is literally just bad media comprehension.

1139
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Like it's a failure to plausibly interpret a video

1140
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:40,320
that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult.

1141
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
And so much of the negative response to that video

1142
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,320
is just pure emotion.

1143
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
I always hear,

1144
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,320
I don't care what you intended,

1145
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:48,320
trans people were hurt by that video.

1146
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:50,320
You hurt trans people.

1147
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,320
But here's the thing.

1148
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,320
Just because you were hurt by content I made

1149
00:44:54,320 --> 00:44:56,320
doesn't mean that the content is bad

1150
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,320
or that I'm victimizing you in some way.

1151
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,320
I'll give you an example.

1152
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,320
I did a stream a couple years ago

1153
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:04,320
with a BDSM and kink activist.

1154
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
We were talking about various kinks

1155
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,320
and we got to DDLG,

1156
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,320
which is Daddy Dom Little Girl.

1157
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:14,320
Basically, when consenting adults roleplay age difference

1158
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
and the power dynamic that comes with that.

1159
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
And me and this kink activist

1160
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,320
were just casually discussing what DDLG is,

1161
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:21,320
what it isn't,

1162
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,320
when I noticed someone in the chat

1163
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,320
was starting to totally freak out.

1164
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,320
They were typing in all caps like,

1165
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,320
MY ABUSER USED DDLG TO JUSTIFY RAPING ME.

1166
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:32,320
WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING MY ABUSER?

1167
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,320
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D BETRAY ME LIKE THIS.

1168
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
PLEASE STOP TAKING MONEY

1169
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,320
FROM MY ABUSER'S SIDE.

1170
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,320
PLEASE STOP.

1171
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,320
I'M BEGGING YOU.

1172
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
This was actually really fucking upsetting to me

1173
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,320
because this person was clearly in a lot of pain.

1174
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,320
They were having a panic attack

1175
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,320
because they were having a trauma trigger reaction

1176
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:49,320
to this conversation.

1177
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,320
And I kept telling them to leave the stream

1178
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,320
and take care of themselves,

1179
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
but they wouldn't do it.

1180
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,320
So I had to block them

1181
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,320
and then later get in touch

1182
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,320
and make sure they were okay.

1183
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,320
Now, was their pain very real?

1184
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:03,320
Yes.

1185
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:04,320
Was it triggered

1186
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,320
by the content I was streaming?

1187
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,320
Yes.

1188
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,320
But does that mean I did anything wrong?

1189
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:10,320
No.

1190
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,320
Is it wrong to talk about kink

1191
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,320
in contexts where it's clear

1192
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:15,320
you're going to be talking about kink?

1193
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,320
No.

1194
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,320
But when you produce content online

1195
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
that's going to be viewed by thousands

1196
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:21,320
or millions of people,

1197
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,320
there's always some people out there

1198
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:25,320
who are going to be hurt by it.

1199
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:27,320
So if you want to argue that a tweet

1200
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,320
or a video I made is somehow immoral,

1201
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:32,320
I think you need more of an argument

1202
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,320
than just,

1203
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,320
people were hurt.

1204
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
Alright, back to the tweet.

1205
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:37,320
To this day,

1206
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,320
people quote tweet the sentence,

1207
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,320
but surely an account that begins and ends

1208
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:42,320
with I'm not a man

1209
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,320
because I don't identify as one

1210
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,320
is pretty weak.

1211
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
And they claim this is evidence

1212
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,320
that I'm true scum

1213
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:48,320
or that I think people have to prove

1214
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,320
their identities somehow,

1215
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:51,320
which is not at all

1216
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,320
what I was saying in that thread.

1217
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,320
What I was saying is

1218
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,320
if you're trying to persuade a skeptic

1219
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,320
that trans identity is valid,

1220
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:01,320
simply saying I'm not a man

1221
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:02,320
because I don't identify as one

1222
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,320
isn't a very good argument,

1223
00:47:04,320 --> 00:47:05,320
which it isn't.

1224
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,320
I mean, no one has ever been persuaded by that

1225
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
so far as I'm aware.

1226
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
That said,

1227
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,320
I do now disagree with the mindset

1228
00:47:11,320 --> 00:47:13,320
I had when I tweeted this.

1229
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,320
Back then, I still delusionally believed

1230
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:17,320
that it was possible to rationally explain

1231
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,320
why trans identity is valid,

1232
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,320
and I was simply looking for

1233
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:22,320
a more persuasive argument than,

1234
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,320
this is how I identify,

1235
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
you have to believe me,

1236
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
no further questions.

1237
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:28,320
But I no longer believe there can be

1238
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:31,320
any rational justification of gender identity,

1239
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,320
which is another reason

1240
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,320
I'm not a transmedicalist.

1241
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,320
Transmedicalism tries to be a rational theory

1242
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,320
about why trans identity is valid,

1243
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:40,320
and I don't think it succeeds as that.

1244
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,320
I don't think anything does.

1245
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,320
My current opinion about this is that

1246
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:46,320
I'm not a man because I don't identify as one

1247
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,320
is as good, or rather as bad,

1248
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:50,320
an argument as any.

1249
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,320
You know, some things in life just

1250
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,320
can't be rationally explained.

1251
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,320
Like love.

1252
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:57,320
Why do you love the person you love?

1253
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,320
Well, because you love them.

1254
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,320
You could write a poem about it,

1255
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
or some gay shit like that,

1256
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,320
but you can't give any actual arguments.

1257
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,320
And why am I a woman?

1258
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,320
Because I'm a woman.

1259
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
That's it.

1260
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,320
I mean, I can describe my experiences

1261
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
and my feelings to you

1262
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,320
to help you understand better,

1263
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,320
but I can't logically prove anything.

1264
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,320
And I'm super fucking sorry

1265
00:48:18,320 --> 00:48:20,320
if you can't handle that mankind

1266
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:22,320
was set adrift in an absurd world.

1267
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
That must be super fucking hard for you.

1268
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
Tell me all about it.

1269
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,320
Next please.

1270
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:29,320
Okay, again we're mid-thread

1271
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:30,320
with missing context,

1272
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,320
but the tweet says,

1273
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,320
whereas I've met 20-year-olds

1274
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,320
in full-on boy mode who are like,

1275
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,320
hi, I'm a trans woman.

1276
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:37,320
She, her pronouns.

1277
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:40,320
So, I guess by including this tweet

1278
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,320
in the ContraPoints' problematic collage,

1279
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,320
people are implying that I don't think

1280
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:48,320
it's valid for someone who presents male

1281
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,320
to identify as a woman

1282
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,320
and request she, her pronouns.

1283
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
Well, that's not true.

1284
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:54,320
I was surprised when I first experienced this,

1285
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,320
but I think it's valid.

1286
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,320
Next.

1287
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:58,320
Okay, mid-thread, no context,

1288
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,320
once again.

1289
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,320
But now you go into these leftist Discord

1290
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,320
slash Facebook groups

1291
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:06,320
and like 20-30% identify as some flavor of trans.

1292
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:09,320
Most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals.

1293
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,320
That seems to be the future.

1294
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,320
Okay, well,

1295
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,320
it's true that many leftist Discord servers

1296
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
are like this.

1297
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:16,320
But reading this back,

1298
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:19,320
I don't like the way the phrase

1299
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:21,320
conventional binary transsexuals

1300
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,320
is hitting my ear.

1301
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:24,320
I can see how it could imply that

1302
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,320
non-binary identities are somehow newfangled,

1303
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,320
which isn't true.

1304
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,320
There's been non-binary people for longer

1305
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
than there's been medical transsexuals,

1306
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,320
in fact,

1307
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,320
so we'll call this a bad tweet.

1308
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:37,320
I apologize for tweeting it,

1309
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,320
and I apologize to any non-binary people

1310
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,320
who felt trivialized by it.

1311
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Okay, this is the big one.

1312
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,320
This tweet got its own article

1313
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,320
in the fucking Guardian.

1314
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:48,320
You know, I really wish people

1315
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,320
would pay less attention to the tweets

1316
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:51,320
I spend 30 seconds writing

1317
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,320
and a little more attention to the videos

1318
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:54,320
that I spend, you know,

1319
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,320
hundreds of hours making.

1320
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:58,320
Anyway, let's look at the tweet.

1321
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,320
This is the most scrutinized paragraph

1322
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:01,320
I've ever written,

1323
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,320
and it's so mediocre.

1324
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:04,320
This has happened to me before

1325
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:06,320
in hyper-woke spaces.

1326
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,320
Like, it's me and a bunch of cis women,

1327
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,320
and we all have to go in a circle

1328
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,320
saying she, her, because I'm there.

1329
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,320
There's this paradox

1330
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,320
where I can go to a sports bar

1331
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,320
in North Carolina

1332
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,320
and be Miss Mamed all night,

1333
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,320
no question.

1334
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,320
But in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces,

1335
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,320
I have to explain my pronouns

1336
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
and watch woke people

1337
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,320
awkwardly correct themselves

1338
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:24,320
every time they say,

1339
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:25,320
you guys.

1340
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,320
I guess it's good for people

1341
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,320
who use they, them only

1342
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:29,320
and want only gender-neutral language,

1343
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:31,320
but it comes at the minor expense

1344
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,320
of semi-passable transes like me,

1345
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:36,320
and that's super fucking hard for us.

1346
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:38,320
So people interpreted this tweet

1347
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,320
as me being against the practice

1348
00:50:40,320 --> 00:50:41,320
of sharing pronouns,

1349
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:44,320
which I'm literally just not.

1350
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,320
Like, I've actually been the person

1351
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,320
who initiates the pronoun circle

1352
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:48,320
many times.

1353
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,320
The backstory of this tweet

1354
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,320
is basically that

1355
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,320
I once got triggered

1356
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,320
in a situation

1357
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,320
where I was with a bunch of cis women

1358
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,320
and we all had to go around

1359
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,320
saying our pronouns,

1360
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,320
and like a typical triggered tranny,

1361
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:03,320
I tiptoed over to Twitter

1362
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,320
to tip-top type it out.

1363
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,320
But here's the thing,

1364
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:08,320
by the end of this thread,

1365
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,320
I had already talked myself away

1366
00:51:10,320 --> 00:51:11,320
from the initial frustration

1367
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,320
I was expressing.

1368
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:14,320
If you know my videos and my voice,

1369
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,320
then you know me saying

1370
00:51:15,320 --> 00:51:17,320
it comes at the minor expense

1371
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:20,320
of semi-passable transes

1372
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,320
and that's super fucking hard for us

1373
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,320
is sarcastic.

1374
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,320
It's a minor expense

1375
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:28,320
It's not actually very hard

1376
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,320
for us, Gorge.

1377
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,320
It's fine.

1378
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,320
But people on Twitter

1379
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:34,320
don't watch my videos

1380
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:36,320
and they don't get sarcasm.

1381
00:51:36,320 --> 00:51:39,320
So people flipped out over this.

1382
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,320
I was getting dragged

1383
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:43,320
and I made the poor decision

1384
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:45,320
to try to solve the tweet problem

1385
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,320
with more tweeting,

1386
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,320
which 100% of the time

1387
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:50,320
is like trying to put out a fire

1388
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,320
with lighter fluid.

1389
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,320
So me and my dumb brain

1390
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:55,320
did another short thread

1391
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:57,320
trying to clarify what I was saying

1392
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,320
and defending my right

1393
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,320
to talk about my own experiences.

1394
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
That didn't make things any better.

1395
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:05,320
So in a state of anger and frustration,

1396
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:07,320
I tweeted out yet another thread.

1397
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:08,320
And this time I said

1398
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
some truly stupid things,

1399
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,320
including the now infamous line.

1400
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,320
I sometimes feel like the last

1401
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,320
of the old school transsexuals.

1402
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,320
I honestly don't know what the fuck

1403
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:21,320
I was even trying to say.

1404
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,320
I don't feel like the last

1405
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:24,320
of the old school transsexuals.

1406
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,320
I don't even know what that means.

1407
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:28,320
I guess I basically meant that

1408
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,320
offline, I don't have any radical aspirations.

1409
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:34,320
You know, I want to be inconspicuous.

1410
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,320
I want to blend in.

1411
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,320
And that's what I meant by old school.

1412
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,320
You know, I want people to assume my pronouns.

1413
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:41,320
You know, it's funny because

1414
00:52:41,320 --> 00:52:43,320
it is very different from the way I am online

1415
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,320
where I'm totally shameless and open.

1416
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,320
I'm like,

1417
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,320
sexual confession, everybody.

1418
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,320
Sexual confession.

1419
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,320
I have abnormal urges.

1420
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,320
It's 1am.

1421
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:54,320
My name is Amy.

1422
00:52:54,320 --> 00:52:56,320
My neighbors can definitely hear that.

1423
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,320
They know I have abnormal urges now.

1424
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:00,320
They already knew that.

1425
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,320
But offline, I'm an inconspicuous pussy,

1426
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,320
like a total coward.

1427
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,320
So,

1428
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,320
this was a rage thread

1429
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,320
and I apologize for tweeting it.

1430
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:17,320
Let's go back to Bug Angel.

1431
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,320
I'm kind of a conscientious objector

1432
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,320
to the practice of condemning someone

1433
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,320
based on a collage of their worst tweets

1434
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,320
taken out of context.

1435
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:27,320
But I definitely do have anxiety about this.

1436
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,320
Like, I think I'm doing the right thing

1437
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:31,320
by not condemning Buck as true scum and evil,

1438
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:34,320
but I mean, I could be wrong.

1439
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,320
What if I am basically sacrificing myself

1440
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,320
for the sake of a person who really is

1441
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,320
as bad as Twitter says?

1442
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,320
Maybe tomorrow he'll tweet,

1443
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,320
fuck non-binary people,

1444
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,320
and then I'll have fucked up.

1445
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:47,320
This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me.

1446
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:51,320
But I do believe that by refusing to participate

1447
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:52,320
in the anti-Buck Angel pilot,

1448
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:57,320
I am erring on the morally safer side of things.

1449
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,320
Because even if he is a little true scummy,

1450
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,320
excommunicating him from the trans community

1451
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:05,320
is still probably not the best approach to take.

1452
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:06,320
In my experience,

1453
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:09,320
when people accept binary but not non-binary trans people,

1454
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,320
it usually takes like a 30 minute conversation

1455
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:15,320
to win them over to some level of non-binary acceptance.

1456
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,320
And I'll give you a couple examples.

1457
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,320
The first time I was ever canceled,

1458
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:21,320
like totally trashed on Twitter,

1459
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,320
was back in 2017,

1460
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,320
when I had not yet medically transitioned,

1461
00:54:25,320 --> 00:54:28,320
and at the time I identified as non-binary.

1462
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,320
And at VidCon 2017,

1463
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,320
I met up with a YouTuber named June,

1464
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:35,320
who had made some videos where she basically

1465
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,320
mocked the idea of non-binary people.

1466
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:41,320
And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June,

1467
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
and some other people,

1468
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,320
but let's keep them out of it.

1469
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,320
And people on Twitter totally dragged me

1470
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:47,320
for being a peak liberal bootlicker

1471
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,320
who's best friends with transphobic abusers.

1472
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,320
Christ.

1473
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:53,320
Fucking people, man.

1474
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,320
It's so fucking frustrating.

1475
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,320
And, you know,

1476
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,320
I'm not gonna claim I changed June's mind,

1477
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,320
because I don't know what her thought process was,

1478
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,320
but I did talk to her about non-binary identity,

1479
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:06,320
and she did remove her anti-non-binary videos.

1480
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:08,320
And I don't have any regrets about that brunch.

1481
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,320
Example two.

1482
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,320
A couple months later,

1483
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,320
I did a livestream with a conservative trans woman YouTuber

1484
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,320
named...

1485
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,320
What was her name?

1486
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:24,320
Sharon?

1487
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,320
Sharon?

1488
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:26,320
Was it Sharon?

1489
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,320
I guess she's just not a very memorable person.

1490
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:30,320
Anyway, she had made some videos saying

1491
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,320
that non-binary identities aren't real.

1492
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,320
But I gave her a chance,

1493
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,320
and she surprised me

1494
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:36,320
by being super compassionate and thoughtful.

1495
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,320
By the end of that stream,

1496
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:40,320
she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity.

1497
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,320
So again,

1498
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:43,320
the point is not that I'm some kind of persuasive genius.

1499
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:44,320
If I was a persuasive genius,

1500
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,320
maybe I could talk myself out of being canceled.

1501
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,320
The point is that sometimes,

1502
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:51,320
people who seem ignorant or hate me,

1503
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,320
just need to be given a non-judgmental space

1504
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,320
to learn and grow and think.

1505
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,320
And to just condemn them as hopeless bigots

1506
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,320
actually prevents that growth from happening.

1507
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:01,320
And Sharon,

1508
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,320
despite her, you know,

1509
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,320
totally forgettable personality,

1510
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:06,320
turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person.

1511
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:07,320
Like later on,

1512
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,320
she actually made an apology video to non-binary people,

1513
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,320
and I became good friends with her.

1514
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:14,320
And we worked together on most of the videos I've made this year.

1515
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,320
You know,

1516
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:16,320
until she ruined my life

1517
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,320
by recommending a canceled John Waters impersonator.

1518
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:19,320
I guess the moral is,

1519
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,320
NEVER

1520
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,320
talk to people you disagree with.

1521
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,320
It will only lead to pain.

1522
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:35,320
I do think there's something off with my hormone dose.

1523
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,320
Like,

1524
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:38,320
I'm crying three times a day.

1525
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,320
Oh, and I can't cum unless there's vibrators

1526
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:41,320
in at least three of my holes.

1527
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,320
It happens like once a month.

1528
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,320
There has to be a full moon.

1529
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:46,320
I honestly only still bother

1530
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,320
because it numbs the pain for a few moments.

1531
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:49,320
What I'm trying to say is,

1532
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:51,320
I really do believe in conversation,

1533
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,320
which means hearing out multiple perspectives.

1534
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,320
I don't want my audience to get all their information

1535
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,320
about trans people from me,

1536
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:59,320
and I think it's important to listen to criticism.

1537
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,320
So I encourage my audience to go watch

1538
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:03,320
some non-binary YouTubers

1539
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:05,320
who have criticized me and criticized Buck Angel.

1540
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,320
For example,

1541
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:10,320
go check out non-binary YouTuber Luxander's video about me,

1542
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:13,320
and non-binary YouTuber Corviday's video about Buck Angel.

1543
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:16,320
I think YouTube, as a platform,

1544
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:18,320
is better at producing criticism

1545
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,320
rather than canceling.

1546
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,320
And I think that's because,

1547
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,320
at least in the vlog format,

1548
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,320
making a video forces you to confront the fact

1549
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:29,320
that you're a human being with a face and a name

1550
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,320
who can be held accountable for the things that you say.

1551
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,320
But people on Twitter,

1552
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:34,320
it's a different story.

1553
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:35,320
And I think it's time we take a look

1554
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:37,320
at what canceling really is.

1555
00:57:37,320 --> 00:57:39,320
I've given you enough context now

1556
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,320
for you to understand what I'm about to show you,

1557
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:44,320
which is what I saw on my timeline every day

1558
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,320
for nearly a month.

1559
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:47,320
All these tweets are from the aftermath

1560
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,320
of my uploading Opulence,

1561
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:50,320
two months ago,

1562
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,320
when the Buck Angel scandal first broke.

1563
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:54,320
And someone better hold my hand now,

1564
00:57:54,320 --> 00:57:55,320
because this gets ugly.

1565
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:01,320
Hey, if any of you still support ContraPoints

1566
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,320
after her bigging up and collaborating

1567
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:05,320
with notable TERF favorite and true scum Buck Angel,

1568
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:07,320
you're no friend to gender non-conforming,

1569
00:58:07,320 --> 00:58:10,320
non-passing, and non-binary trans people.

1570
00:58:10,320 --> 00:58:11,320
Fuck her,

1571
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,320
and fuck her fucking rift.

1572
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:15,320
I am absolutely furious right now.

1573
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,320
Weird how I'm 30 and trans,

1574
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,320
and manage not to be a true scum.

1575
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:20,320
Maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly.

1576
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:23,320
Or maybe ContraPoints is a conniving rat fucking capo

1577
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,320
who could do with a fully wound backhand to the mouth.

1578
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,320
Since I'm out of Twitter jail now,

1579
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,320
I just want to say,

1580
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,320
fuck ContraPoints,

1581
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:31,320
her sycophantic stans,

1582
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,320
and all her bread tube chums

1583
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:34,320
who close ranks to protect her

1584
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:36,320
after she throws the rest of the trans community

1585
00:58:36,320 --> 00:58:38,320
under the bus for profit.

1586
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,320
Natalie Nguyen is a fucking grifter.

1587
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,320
ContraPoints' videos are now just style over substance,

1588
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,320
so that explains why she took to TERF ideology so well.

1589
00:58:45,320 --> 00:58:46,320
ContraPoints working with true scum,

1590
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,320
now definitively proves

1591
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,320
that pretty much everyone defending ContraPoints

1592
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,320
just hates enbies,

1593
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,320
and are also true scum.

1594
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:55,320
Legit gonna start on following peeps

1595
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,320
that continue to follow ContraPoints at this point.

1596
00:58:57,320 --> 00:59:00,320
Do know my wording of pretty much everyone.

1597
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,320
I know there are some

1598
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,320
that were probably blindsided by this somehow.

1599
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,320
So long as you know that ContraPoints is true scum,

1600
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,320
you're safe and cool.

1601
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,320
Eat shit, Natalie.

1602
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,320
For someone who used to identify as genderqueer,

1603
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,320
we expected more from you,

1604
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:15,320
but I guess when your head's this far up your own ass,

1605
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,320
it's hard to consider others.

1606
00:59:17,320 --> 00:59:20,320
ContraPoints, more like DisaPoints.

1607
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,320
That's a good one.

1608
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:23,320
If you're gonna drag me, at least be funny.

1609
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,320
Fuck Buck Angel.

1610
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:26,320
Fuck ContraPoints.

1611
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,320
Fuck any real transsexual.

1612
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:30,320
Fuck your grift.

1613
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:33,320
Here's what hashtag ContraPoints stands don't understand.

1614
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:35,320
If Natalie refuses to accept

1615
00:59:35,320 --> 00:59:37,320
that she has an apology to make,

1616
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:39,320
and continues profiting from it,

1617
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:41,320
it will become our responsibility

1618
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,320
to work on deplatforming her

1619
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,320
just like every other racist, sexist,

1620
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,320
bigoted content creator.

1621
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,320
No one has actually suggested or attempted

1622
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:49,320
to actually cancel her,

1623
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:51,320
but the longer this goes on without an apology

1624
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,320
and commitment to do better,

1625
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:54,320
the stronger the case becomes

1626
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:57,320
for actively working to deplatform her.

1627
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,320
So, in other words,

1628
00:59:58,320 --> 01:00:00,320
no one has suggested we cancel her,

1629
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,320
but we should cancel her.

1630
01:00:02,320 --> 01:00:03,320
Great.

1631
01:00:03,320 --> 01:00:05,320
Can everyone finally agree

1632
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:08,320
that ContraPoints belongs directly inside a garbage can?

1633
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:09,320
Here I am, sweetie.

1634
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:11,320
ContraPoints collaborating with Angel Buck.

1635
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,320
Angel Buck.

1636
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,320
Thanks for letting us all know

1637
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:17,320
that you had no idea who he even was

1638
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,320
until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about.

1639
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:23,320
ContraPoints collaborating with Angel Buck,

1640
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,320
a transmedicalist who once outed a trans person

1641
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:27,320
to try and destroy them,

1642
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:28,320
and supporting him because

1643
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:30,320
he looks and sounds like a proper man,

1644
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,320
isn't a small, itty-bitty, tipsy-topsy fucking mistake.

1645
01:00:34,320 --> 01:00:36,320
This is a huge deal.

1646
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:39,320
ContraPoints could be literally collaborating with Hitler.

1647
01:00:40,320 --> 01:00:42,320
We have a Hitler comparison.

1648
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:45,320
We could be literally collaborating with Hitler today.

1649
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:46,320
And you all would be like,

1650
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:49,320
oh, well, she's just a little flawed, you know.

1651
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:50,320
Fuck off.

1652
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,320
Can Natalie Wynne stop being a coward

1653
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:54,320
and commit to being a transmed?

1654
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:56,320
It's really tiring to watch this happen every week.

1655
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,320
Natalie Wynne is a spoiled brat

1656
01:00:58,320 --> 01:01:00,320
who refuses to take accountability.

1657
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,320
Anyone who supports Natalie Wynne

1658
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:03,320
does not support nonbinary people.

1659
01:01:03,320 --> 01:01:05,320
Natalie Wynne is such a terrible person.

1660
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:06,320
My God.

1661
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:09,320
Every cis and not nonbinary person

1662
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,320
who thought Natalie Wynne wasn't transmed

1663
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:14,320
now owes me and every nonbinary person $50.

1664
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:16,320
Joe Biden has a better position on the validity

1665
01:01:16,320 --> 01:01:18,320
of nonbinary gender than ContraPoints.

1666
01:01:18,320 --> 01:01:22,320
My opinion is that ContraPoints really sucks a lot

1667
01:01:22,320 --> 01:01:23,320
and I don't like her.

1668
01:01:23,320 --> 01:01:25,320
I hate ContraPoints so goddamn much

1669
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,320
it's unbelievable.

1670
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,320
ContraPoints be like,

1671
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,320
let's hear some nonbinary people.

1672
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,320
This is a very good impression of me.

1673
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:33,320
You're doing very good, sweetie.

1674
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:35,320
You're doing very, very good.

1675
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,320
Buck Angel is a TERF apologizer,

1676
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,320
bootlicker, and true scum.

1677
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,320
Any association with him

1678
01:01:40,320 --> 01:01:42,320
must be seen as hostile

1679
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,320
to the trans community as a whole,

1680
01:01:44,320 --> 01:01:46,320
let alone denial of nonbinary existence.

1681
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,320
That's the line in the sand, folks.

1682
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,320
Where do you stand?

1683
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:53,320
And here we fucking are, dude.

1684
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,320
Buck fucking Angel on ContraPoints.

1685
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:59,320
Eat my entire ass.

1686
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:01,320
What?

1687
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,320
What?

1688
01:02:02,320 --> 01:02:03,320
This is Natalie.

1689
01:02:03,320 --> 01:02:05,320
Natalie is a transmedicalist.

1690
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:07,320
This is Natalie's friend Lindsay.

1691
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:09,320
Lindsay is a leftuber.

1692
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:11,320
Natalie and Lindsay are still friends

1693
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:13,320
because Natalie and Lindsay

1694
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:15,320
are both cowards.

1695
01:02:15,320 --> 01:02:17,320
Leftuber's a griff.

1696
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:18,320
Oh, and they made me the man.

1697
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,320
The shade.

1698
01:02:19,320 --> 01:02:21,320
Issues that arose with

1699
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,320
being in Contra's new video.

1700
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:25,320
Her video on TERFs make no sense now.

1701
01:02:25,320 --> 01:02:27,320
Her video on trans trenders make no sense now.

1702
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,320
You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel

1703
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,320
totally contradicts the videos

1704
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,320
I've spent hundreds of hours making,

1705
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,320
do you think maybe your interpretation could be wrong?

1706
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:38,320
Apparently not.

1707
01:02:38,320 --> 01:02:40,320
Her apology is completely void.

1708
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:42,320
Sends a message that she hates non-binary people.

1709
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:44,320
She is reckless with her content.

1710
01:02:44,320 --> 01:02:47,320
Positives that arose from Buck Angel being in Contra's new video.

1711
01:02:47,320 --> 01:02:52,320
She, uh, has $400,000 this month from Patreon.

1712
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,320
$400,000.

1713
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,320
This number is completely made up.

1714
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:59,320
Like, it is exponentially wrong.

1715
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,320
$400,000.

1716
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:03,320
$400,000 a month.

1717
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:04,320
Hot take.

1718
01:03:04,320 --> 01:03:06,320
ContraPoints is the leftist PewDiePie.

1719
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,320
Personally, I like to characterize her

1720
01:03:08,320 --> 01:03:11,320
as the blair-white wolf in leftist sheep's clothing.

1721
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:14,320
Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece of shit

1722
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:17,320
who still has not apologized for platforming truescum

1723
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:19,320
and is actively taking their side.

1724
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:22,320
Anyway, if you still support ContraPoints,

1725
01:03:22,320 --> 01:03:24,320
get the hell away from me.

1726
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:26,320
Pee-pee-poo-poo, I'm ContraPoints

1727
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:28,320
and I can't stop being a transmedicalist

1728
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,320
and shitting myself in public.

1729
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:35,320
Valid criticisms of marginalized people.

1730
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,320
Fuck ContraPoints.

1731
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,320
Fuck truescum.

1732
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

1733
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:42,320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

1734
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

1735
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

1736
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,320
ContraPoints is a truescum.

1737
01:03:47,320 --> 01:03:49,320
You know, when you repeat the same fucking sentence

1738
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:51,320
over and over again, it does...

1739
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:53,320
You know when you repeat the same sentence over and over again,

1740
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:56,320
it actually doesn't get more persuasive.

1741
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:59,320
In fact, it might get less persuasive.

1742
01:03:59,320 --> 01:04:02,320
Because true things usually only have to be said once.

1743
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:05,320
If you still support ContraPoints,

1744
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:08,320
then follow me immediately and never interact with me again.

1745
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:11,320
In conclusion, fuck Natalie Nguyen

1746
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:13,320
and fuck everything she has to say.

1747
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:26,320
Okay, let's get started.

1748
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:30,320
So, that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets.

1749
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:32,320
And all of this, let me remind you,

1750
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:35,320
is over a ten second voiceover clip

1751
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:37,320
in a 48 minute video

1752
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,320
about a completely unrelated topic.

1753
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,320
Like, how do you work?

1754
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,320
How do you create

1755
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,320
when a decision so trivial

1756
01:04:44,320 --> 01:04:47,320
can become the main event for weeks of your life?

1757
01:04:47,320 --> 01:04:49,320
And the tweets are just the beginning.

1758
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,320
After that, there's the Reddit threads,

1759
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:51,320
and the YouTube comments,

1760
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,320
and the Facebook discourse,

1761
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,320
and the Medium posts,

1762
01:04:54,320 --> 01:04:55,320
and the Newsweek article.

1763
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:57,320
Opulence is a video

1764
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,320
me and Theron spent hundreds of hours

1765
01:04:59,320 --> 01:05:01,320
carefully piecing together.

1766
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:02,320
I think it's my best video.

1767
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:04,320
And to have the response to it

1768
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:07,320
completely overwhelmed by one minor casting decision

1769
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:10,320
is heartbreaking and infuriating to me.

1770
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,320
And it's left me with much less energy

1771
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:13,320
to create new things.

1772
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,320
But here's the thing,

1773
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,320
people on Twitter saying mean things about me

1774
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,320
is not the worst of it.

1775
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,320
Not even close.

1776
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:22,320
Like, I'm a politically opinionated trans woman

1777
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:24,320
who publicly transitioned

1778
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,320
while making anti-fascist content

1779
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:29,320
on a notoriously right-wing platform.

1780
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:31,320
Sweaty, I am so used to reading

1781
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,320
mean things about myself online,

1782
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:36,320
most of you probably can't even begin to imagine

1783
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:37,320
how used to it I am.

1784
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,320
And the way you psychologically survive in that situation

1785
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,320
is you block the people and platforms

1786
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:43,320
who are harassing you,

1787
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,320
and you pay it no mind.

1788
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:47,320
But there's some things you can't block.

1789
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:49,320
And a big one is you can't block people

1790
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:51,320
from going after your friends and colleagues.

1791
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:54,320
And that is exactly what people did to me

1792
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,320
at the height of the Buck Angel incident.

1793
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,320
Lindsay Ellis,

1794
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:59,320
Ollie from Philosophy Tube,

1795
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:00,320
and Hbomberguy

1796
01:06:00,320 --> 01:06:02,320
all got inundated with tweets

1797
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,320
demanding that they publicly disown me,

1798
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:08,320
a person they've all been friends with for years,

1799
01:06:08,320 --> 01:06:09,320
or else.

1800
01:06:09,320 --> 01:06:12,320
In response to demands that she apologize,

1801
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,320
Lindsay released a statement where she said,

1802
01:06:14,320 --> 01:06:16,320
I was not involved in Opulence.

1803
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,320
My name was mentioned in it,

1804
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:20,320
but I did not participate in the production.

1805
01:06:20,320 --> 01:06:23,320
Therefore, with regards to calls for me to apologize,

1806
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:27,320
I have to ask, apologize for what?

1807
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,320
There is only one logical answer.

1808
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:32,320
Apologize for being friends with Natalie.

1809
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:34,320
And here's a response to her statement.

1810
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:36,320
I don't need to consider you my fucking friend

1811
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:39,320
to disagree with beliefs you knowingly solicit

1812
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:40,320
or allow on your platform.

1813
01:06:40,320 --> 01:06:41,320
Same with Contra.

1814
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,320
It just means you're willing to allow awful ideas

1815
01:06:44,320 --> 01:06:46,320
to fester for the sake of financial gain,

1816
01:06:46,320 --> 01:06:47,320
which is fine,

1817
01:06:47,320 --> 01:06:50,320
but it makes you a piece of shit.

1818
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,320
And here's a comment at Hbomberguy.

1819
01:06:52,320 --> 01:06:54,320
I doubt that you were going to read this,

1820
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,320
but can you please just tell us your thoughts

1821
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:57,320
on that whole situation

1822
01:06:57,320 --> 01:07:01,320
so we could at least know that you were on our side?

1823
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:04,320
We don't want to have to cancel all of y'all

1824
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,320
and cause BreadTube to go into a schism

1825
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:07,320
as a result of this.

1826
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,320
Thank you.

1827
01:07:08,320 --> 01:07:11,320
Nice YouTube channel you have there, friend.

1828
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,320
Would be a shame if someone canceled it.

1829
01:07:15,320 --> 01:07:17,320
So fucking sinister.

1830
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:19,320
Oli of PhilosophyTube released his own statement

1831
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:22,320
affirming his support of non-binary people,

1832
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:23,320
but adding,

1833
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:26,320
Sadly, I've also been harassed, threatened, doxxed,

1834
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:28,320
had my private life speculated on

1835
01:07:28,320 --> 01:07:30,320
and my loved ones insulted,

1836
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:31,320
and recognizing the feelings of those

1837
01:07:31,320 --> 01:07:34,320
who kindly raised their concerns in a polite way,

1838
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,320
I do not wish to legitimize the great many people

1839
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:38,320
who use their hurt as a cover

1840
01:07:38,320 --> 01:07:41,320
for unacceptable toxic and abusive behavior.

1841
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:43,320
And here are some responses to Oli.

1842
01:07:43,320 --> 01:07:45,320
As a non-binary fan of yours,

1843
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:47,320
I'm disappointed in this non-apology.

1844
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:51,320
Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for?

1845
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:53,320
Ever having associated with me?

1846
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:57,320
Things we are going to criticize Oli PhilosophyTube for.

1847
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:59,320
Being a sniveling hypocritical piece of shit.

1848
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:01,320
Refusing to listen to trans people.

1849
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:04,320
Actively, openly, and repeatedly mocking the trans people

1850
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:06,320
he refuses to listen to.

1851
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,320
Thanks for the apology.

1852
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,320
Now stop endorsing contrapoints.

1853
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:12,320
Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing

1854
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:16,320
is demanding that cis people publicly condemn

1855
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:21,320
a trans woman for loosely associating with another trans person.

1856
01:08:21,320 --> 01:08:24,320
Does that strike anyone else as wildly inappropriate?

1857
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:25,320
Even Mia Mulder,

1858
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:28,320
a trans woman who has never publicly associated with me,

1859
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:32,320
got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Oli.

1860
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:35,320
You know, after he made the post discussing being doxxed and threatened.

1861
01:08:35,320 --> 01:08:38,320
And just for that, she gets put on the enemy list.

1862
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:41,320
I'm sad to say that Mia is on the list

1863
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:43,320
of people that have stood by contrapoints

1864
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,320
as she has continued to be a bigoted piece of shit.

1865
01:08:46,320 --> 01:08:47,320
To which Mia responds,

1866
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,320
stood by contrapoints?

1867
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:50,320
Jesus Christ.

1868
01:08:50,320 --> 01:08:52,320
No matter what I do, people call me out

1869
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:54,320
and I'm not even related to the video

1870
01:08:54,320 --> 01:08:55,320
and I don't even know Natalie.

1871
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:57,320
The chain of guilt by association

1872
01:08:57,320 --> 01:08:59,320
is so long and twisted,

1873
01:08:59,320 --> 01:09:01,320
I can barely even follow it.

1874
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,320
So they're going after Mia,

1875
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:05,320
who tweeted a heart at Oli,

1876
01:09:05,320 --> 01:09:08,320
who failed to condemn me

1877
01:09:08,320 --> 01:09:11,320
for my voiceover casting of Buck Angel,

1878
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,320
who was retweeted by a TERF.

1879
01:09:13,320 --> 01:09:16,320
We're only missing a couple degrees of separation

1880
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:18,320
before every living person on the planet Earth

1881
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:21,320
is cancelled over the Buck Angel situation.

1882
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:23,320
And several colleagues of mine, by the way,

1883
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:25,320
Lindsay, Harry, Oli,

1884
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:27,320
they all took a financial hit.

1885
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:29,320
They've all lost some Patreon support.

1886
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,320
One of Lindsay's former supporters

1887
01:09:31,320 --> 01:09:34,320
even demanded a $38 lifetime refund,

1888
01:09:34,320 --> 01:09:35,320
saying,

1889
01:09:35,320 --> 01:09:36,320
Dear Lindsay,

1890
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:38,320
I'm sorry for being pushy,

1891
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:40,320
but I really am going to be needing a refund.

1892
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,320
I gave money to your operation

1893
01:09:43,320 --> 01:09:44,320
under the pretense

1894
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,320
that you wouldn't do anything morally objectionable,

1895
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,320
and supporting contrapoints

1896
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:50,320
and blaming us for taking issue with that

1897
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:53,320
is, in my opinion, amoral.

1898
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:54,320
Please respond.

1899
01:09:54,320 --> 01:09:56,320
I hope she sent it to them in pennies.

1900
01:09:56,320 --> 01:09:57,320
So look,

1901
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,320
I'm very grateful to my colleagues

1902
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,320
for sticking by me through all this,

1903
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:04,320
but I'm also aware that I'm becoming a burden

1904
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,320
to anyone who associates with me.

1905
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:08,320
I have no collaborators in this video.

1906
01:10:08,320 --> 01:10:10,320
I'm working on this totally alone

1907
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:14,320
because I'm aware of how radioactive I am right now,

1908
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
and I don't want to contaminate anyone else.

1909
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:19,320
During the height of this most recent cancelling,

1910
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,320
a creator I admire DMed me to let me know,

1911
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,320
I cut the shout out to you in my last video

1912
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,320
because I was nervous

1913
01:10:25,320 --> 01:10:27,320
to draw the ire of your detractors

1914
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:29,320
who are getting genuinely scary,

1915
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,320
but I wouldn't want you to think I was disavowing you,

1916
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:35,320
regardless of how many people are asking me to.

1917
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,320
Jesus Christ.

1918
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:40,320
The situation here is that any cis person who defends me,

1919
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:42,320
or even associates with me in any way,

1920
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,320
will be labeled a transphobe.

1921
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,320
Any binary trans person who associates with me

1922
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,320
will be branded an enbyphobe.

1923
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:51,320
And any non-binary people who associate with me

1924
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:53,320
will be ostracized from their own community.

1925
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,320
So on the internet,

1926
01:10:54,320 --> 01:10:56,320
I find myself increasingly alone.

1927
01:10:56,320 --> 01:10:59,320
I'm isolated by the harassment.

1928
01:10:59,320 --> 01:11:01,320
And that is ultimately the point.

1929
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:03,320
To exile me from my community,

1930
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:04,320
from any community.

1931
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,320
And it's all because I refuse to participate

1932
01:11:06,320 --> 01:11:09,320
in doing exactly that to Buck Angel.

1933
01:11:09,320 --> 01:11:11,320
My experiences have made me so disillusioned

1934
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,320
with the idea that social media callouts

1935
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,320
can lead to any kind of justice

1936
01:11:15,320 --> 01:11:18,320
that I've essentially sworn off participating in them.

1937
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:21,320
There's a fairly prominent figure in leftist politics

1938
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,320
who I could absolutely hashtag immediately.

1939
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,320
But I'm never going to do it.

1940
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,320
Because I have no faith left

1941
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:31,320
in the process of callout vigilante justice.

1942
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,320
And I'm not saying I'm totally against meetooing people,

1943
01:11:34,320 --> 01:11:35,320
because I think in some cases,

1944
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:38,320
it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do.

1945
01:11:38,320 --> 01:11:39,320
But in my case,

1946
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,320
I feel like I just know too much

1947
01:11:41,320 --> 01:11:44,320
about the dark side of social media shaming

1948
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,320
to ever want to participate in it again.

1949
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:48,320
You know, I feel like the story would end up being

1950
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:49,320
taken out of my control,

1951
01:11:49,320 --> 01:11:52,320
warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways.

1952
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:54,320
It would end up just haunting me.

1953
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:56,320
It would end up just haunting both me

1954
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:58,320
and the person I'd be accusing,

1955
01:11:58,320 --> 01:11:59,320
which in this case,

1956
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:00,320
honestly,

1957
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,320
neither of us deserves.

1958
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,320
So I'm just not willing to take that risk.

1959
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,320
Except maybe in some very extreme situation,

1960
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:08,320
which this just isn't.

1961
01:12:08,320 --> 01:12:09,320
It's not worth it.

1962
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:10,320
And likewise,

1963
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:12,320
when a mob is at my doorstep

1964
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,320
demanding I condemn Buck Angel

1965
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,320
to save myself from cancellation,

1966
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:17,320
no!

1967
01:12:17,320 --> 01:12:19,320
I'm just not going to do that.

1968
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,320
I'm a conscientious objector.

1969
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:23,320
I'm willing to go to Twitter jail for this.

1970
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:25,320
Take me away, boys.

1971
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,320
If there's one thing I can't stand,

1972
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,320
it's bread tube videos.

1973
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:39,320
Part eight and a half.

1974
01:12:39,320 --> 01:12:42,320
The philosophy of being fucked in the ass.

1975
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,320
Ugh.

1976
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,320
I have done this to YouTube.

1977
01:12:45,320 --> 01:12:46,320
And I'm sorry.

1978
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:47,320
So look,

1979
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:49,320
canceling is not criticism.

1980
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,320
It is not holding someone accountable.

1981
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,320
It is an attack

1982
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,320
on a human being.

1983
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,320
In this video,

1984
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:56,320
I use the word canceling

1985
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:58,320
more or less synonymously

1986
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:00,320
with what feminist Jo Freeman,

1987
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:01,320
author of The Bitch Manifesto,

1988
01:13:01,320 --> 01:13:02,320
calls

1989
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:03,320
trashing.

1990
01:13:03,320 --> 01:13:04,320
And I've linked her essay,

1991
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:06,320
The Dark Side of Sisterhood,

1992
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:08,320
in the description.

1993
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,320
It was originally published

1994
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,320
in Ms. Magazine in 1976,

1995
01:13:11,320 --> 01:13:13,320
but it is a perfect description

1996
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:16,320
of what goes on on trans Twitter today.

1997
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:17,320
It is not disagreement.

1998
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,320
It is not conflict.

1999
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:20,320
It is not opposition.

2000
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:22,320
These are perfectly ordinary phenomena

2001
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:23,320
which,

2002
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,320
when engaged in mutually,

2003
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:25,320
honestly,

2004
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:26,320
and not excessively,

2005
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:28,320
are necessary to keep an organism

2006
01:13:28,320 --> 01:13:30,320
or organization healthy and active.

2007
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,320
Trashing is a particularly vicious form

2008
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:35,320
of character assassination

2009
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:37,320
which amounts to psychological rape.

2010
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,320
It is manipulative,

2011
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:39,320
dishonest,

2012
01:13:39,320 --> 01:13:40,320
and excessive.

2013
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:41,320
It is occasionally disguised

2014
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:43,320
by the rhetoric of honest conflict

2015
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,320
or covered up by denying

2016
01:13:45,320 --> 01:13:47,320
that any disapproval exists at all.

2017
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:48,320
But it is not done

2018
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:50,320
to expose disagreements

2019
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:51,320
or resolve differences.

2020
01:13:51,320 --> 01:13:52,320
It is done

2021
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,320
to disparage and destroy.

2022
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,320
Whatever methods are used,

2023
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:57,320
trashing involves a violation

2024
01:13:57,320 --> 01:13:58,320
of one's integrity,

2025
01:13:58,320 --> 01:14:00,320
a declaration of one's worthlessness,

2026
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:03,320
and an impugning of one's motives.

2027
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,320
In effect,

2028
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:06,320
what is attacked is not one's actions

2029
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:07,320
or one's ideas,

2030
01:14:07,320 --> 01:14:09,320
but one's self.

2031
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:11,320
And that's what distinguishes

2032
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:12,320
trashing,

2033
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,320
bullying,

2034
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:14,320
or abuse

2035
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,320
from criticism

2036
01:14:15,320 --> 01:14:16,320
or holding accountable.

2037
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:19,320
Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs.

2038
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,320
But when people are canceling me,

2039
01:14:21,320 --> 01:14:22,320
they're not bringing up

2040
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:23,320
my problematic tweets

2041
01:14:23,320 --> 01:14:24,320
because they want me

2042
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:26,320
to revise my beliefs.

2043
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:27,320
No.

2044
01:14:27,320 --> 01:14:28,320
What they're doing

2045
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:29,320
is accumulating evidence

2046
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,320
to support the case

2047
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:32,320
they've decided to make

2048
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:34,320
that I am a horrible person

2049
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:36,320
who must be shunned.

2050
01:14:36,320 --> 01:14:37,320
You know, the only sense

2051
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:38,320
in which I am,

2052
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,320
as they like to say,

2053
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:40,320
the new Blair White,

2054
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:42,320
is that I think I actually have now

2055
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,320
snatched Vanessa's crown

2056
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:46,320
as the most hated Tran

2057
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:47,320
on Tran Twitter.

2058
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:50,320
Vanessa, I'm trying to feud with you.

2059
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:51,320
Feud with me, goddammit.

2060
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:53,320
You can't have a one-sided feud.

2061
01:14:53,320 --> 01:14:54,320
I don't want to be one of those

2062
01:14:54,320 --> 01:14:55,320
trans YouTubers

2063
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:57,320
that just drags other trans people all day

2064
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,320
and they never respond.

2065
01:14:58,320 --> 01:15:00,320
That would be really pathetic.

2066
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:01,320
The new Lacey Green.

2067
01:15:01,320 --> 01:15:02,320
That's the other one.

2068
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,320
The newest in a series of women

2069
01:15:04,320 --> 01:15:07,320
you've decided to treat like supervillains.

2070
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,320
Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hmm?

2071
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:12,320
And supervillain is the right word.

2072
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:14,320
Like, I'm the bad guy.

2073
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:15,320
Duh.

2074
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,320
I'm the enemy.

2075
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,320
And what do you do with the enemy?

2076
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,320
Well, you disavow,

2077
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:21,320
disown,

2078
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:22,320
deplatform,

2079
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:23,320
and destroy.

2080
01:15:23,320 --> 01:15:24,320
As that one tweet put it,

2081
01:15:24,320 --> 01:15:26,320
that's the line in the sand, folks.

2082
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:27,320
Where do you stand?

2083
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,320
If you adequately demonstrate

2084
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:31,320
your searing hatred of Natalie Wynne,

2085
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:33,320
then you're safe and cool.

2086
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:35,320
But if you don't,

2087
01:15:35,320 --> 01:15:37,320
you're on the wrong side of the line, sweaty.

2088
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:40,320
And you, too, are now the enemy.

2089
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,320
Cancel culture trope seven.

2090
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:43,320
Dualism.

2091
01:15:43,320 --> 01:15:45,320
Certain ancient religions

2092
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,320
teach their followers

2093
01:15:46,320 --> 01:15:48,320
to understand the cosmos

2094
01:15:48,320 --> 01:15:49,320
as a struggle

2095
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:50,320
between light and dark,

2096
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:52,320
good and evil.

2097
01:15:52,320 --> 01:15:53,320
And cancel culture

2098
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,320
does more or less the same thing.

2099
01:15:55,320 --> 01:15:57,320
It's binary thinking.

2100
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,320
People are either good

2101
01:15:58,320 --> 01:15:59,320
or they're bad.

2102
01:15:59,320 --> 01:16:00,320
And to add to that,

2103
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:01,320
essentialism.

2104
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:04,320
If a person says or does a bad thing,

2105
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:05,320
we should interpret that

2106
01:16:05,320 --> 01:16:07,320
as the mask slipping,

2107
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:08,320
as a momentary glimpse

2108
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:10,320
of their essential wickedness.

2109
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:12,320
And anyone who wants to remain good

2110
01:16:12,320 --> 01:16:13,320
had better be willing

2111
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:15,320
to publicly condemn

2112
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,320
anyone the community

2113
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,320
has decided is bad.

2114
01:16:18,320 --> 01:16:19,320
There really is something

2115
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:20,320
dystopian about this.

2116
01:16:20,320 --> 01:16:21,320
You have to be willing

2117
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,320
to accuse other people

2118
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,320
to prove your own innocence.

2119
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,320
That's the line in the sand, folks.

2120
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,320
Where do you stand?

2121
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,320
In the most extreme version of this,

2122
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,320
all bad people are equally bad.

2123
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,320
So collaborating with true scum

2124
01:16:34,320 --> 01:16:36,320
means you may as well be true scum.

2125
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:37,320
And of course,

2126
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:38,320
being true scum

2127
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,320
is tantamount to being a TERF.

2128
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,320
And on trans Twitter,

2129
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,320
it is a known fact

2130
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:44,320
that TERFs

2131
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:45,320
are Nazis.

2132
01:16:45,320 --> 01:16:47,320
And this implies that Nazis,

2133
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:48,320
TERFs,

2134
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:49,320
true scum,

2135
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:50,320
people who associate

2136
01:16:50,320 --> 01:16:51,320
with true scum,

2137
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:52,320
people who fail to condemn

2138
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:53,320
people who associate

2139
01:16:53,320 --> 01:16:54,320
with true scum,

2140
01:16:54,320 --> 01:16:56,320
people who offer emotional support

2141
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:57,320
to people who fail to condemn

2142
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:58,320
people who associate

2143
01:16:58,320 --> 01:16:59,320
with true scum,

2144
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:01,320
all of them must be treated

2145
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:02,320
the same way.

2146
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:03,320
De-platform her

2147
01:17:03,320 --> 01:17:04,320
just like every other racist,

2148
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,320
sexist,

2149
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,320
bigoted content creator.

2150
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:09,320
A fully wound backhand

2151
01:17:09,320 --> 01:17:10,320
to the mouth.

2152
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:11,320
I recently read a book

2153
01:17:11,320 --> 01:17:12,320
by Sarah Schulman

2154
01:17:12,320 --> 01:17:14,320
called Conflict Is Not Abuse.

2155
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:15,320
Overstating harm,

2156
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:16,320
community responsibility,

2157
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,320
and the duty of repair.

2158
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:19,320
Basically,

2159
01:17:19,320 --> 01:17:20,320
Schulman's argument

2160
01:17:20,320 --> 01:17:22,320
is that in various contexts,

2161
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:23,320
from romantic relationships

2162
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,320
to community infighting

2163
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:27,320
to international politics,

2164
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:29,320
the overstatement of harm

2165
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,320
is used as a justification

2166
01:17:31,320 --> 01:17:32,320
for cruelty

2167
01:17:32,320 --> 01:17:34,320
and for escalating conflict.

2168
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:35,320
So for example,

2169
01:17:35,320 --> 01:17:36,320
and this is my example,

2170
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,320
not Schulman's,

2171
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:39,320
TERFs fixate

2172
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,320
on the exaggerated danger

2173
01:17:41,320 --> 01:17:43,320
that trans women supposedly pose

2174
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:44,320
to cis women.

2175
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:45,320
And in very classic

2176
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:46,320
overstatement of harm,

2177
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,320
they'll describe everything

2178
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:49,320
they don't like

2179
01:17:49,320 --> 01:17:50,320
as rape.

2180
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:51,320
Trans women entering

2181
01:17:51,320 --> 01:17:52,320
women's spaces

2182
01:17:52,320 --> 01:17:53,320
is rape.

2183
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:54,320
Trans women existing,

2184
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:55,320
Janice Raymond,

2185
01:17:55,320 --> 01:17:56,320
is rape.

2186
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:57,320
And then they use

2187
01:17:57,320 --> 01:17:58,320
that exaggerated harm

2188
01:17:58,320 --> 01:17:59,320
as a justification

2189
01:17:59,320 --> 01:18:01,320
to retaliate against them,

2190
01:18:01,320 --> 01:18:04,320
to dox and harass and shun.

2191
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,320
Well, the same kind of logic

2192
01:18:05,320 --> 01:18:06,320
is used to justify

2193
01:18:06,320 --> 01:18:07,320
abusive behavior

2194
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,320
within the trans community.

2195
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,320
The dualistic thinking,

2196
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:12,320
the essentialism,

2197
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,320
the pseudo-moralism.

2198
01:18:13,320 --> 01:18:14,320
All of this allows people

2199
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:15,320
on Twitter

2200
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:16,320
to treat me

2201
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,320
in an obviously abusive way,

2202
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,320
all the while feeling

2203
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,320
like they're doing the right thing

2204
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:23,320
because they're attacking

2205
01:18:23,320 --> 01:18:24,320
the enemy.

2206
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:25,320
And I realize that some people

2207
01:18:25,320 --> 01:18:26,320
will say that I'm the one

2208
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:28,320
who's overstating harm

2209
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,320
to evade criticism.

2210
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:30,320
Well look,

2211
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:31,320
you've seen the tweets,

2212
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:32,320
the furious demands

2213
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,320
for me to be exiled,

2214
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,320
the doxing and threatening

2215
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:36,320
and ordering around

2216
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,320
of my colleagues,

2217
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,320
the attempts to isolate me

2218
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:39,320
from my community,

2219
01:18:39,320 --> 01:18:40,320
the attacks not on my actions

2220
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:42,320
but on who I am as a person.

2221
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,320
There's not really anything

2222
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:44,320
ambiguous about this,

2223
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,320
it's just abuse.

2224
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:47,320
But I don't think it feels

2225
01:18:47,320 --> 01:18:48,320
like abuse to the people

2226
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,320
who are doing it.

2227
01:18:49,320 --> 01:18:52,320
They feel like they're punching up

2228
01:18:52,320 --> 01:18:55,320
because I'm a celebrity

2229
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,320
with a platform

2230
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,320
and lots of Twitter followers.

2231
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,320
And it's true that I do have more power

2232
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:02,320
than any of them individually.

2233
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:04,320
But as a collective,

2234
01:19:04,320 --> 01:19:06,320
they have a terrifying power

2235
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:08,320
that they don't seem to be aware of

2236
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,320
as individuals.

2237
01:19:09,320 --> 01:19:11,320
As John Ronson,

2238
01:19:11,320 --> 01:19:12,320
author of a great book

2239
01:19:12,320 --> 01:19:13,320
on public shaming put it,

2240
01:19:13,320 --> 01:19:14,320
I suppose that when

2241
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:15,320
shamings are delivered

2242
01:19:15,320 --> 01:19:16,320
like remotely administered

2243
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:17,320
drone strikes,

2244
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:18,320
nobody needs to think

2245
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:19,320
about how ferocious

2246
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,320
our collective power might be.

2247
01:19:21,320 --> 01:19:23,320
The snowflake never needs

2248
01:19:23,320 --> 01:19:24,320
to feel responsible

2249
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,320
for the avalanche.

2250
01:19:25,320 --> 01:19:26,320
And that's how you get

2251
01:19:26,320 --> 01:19:27,320
these situations

2252
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:28,320
where you have hundreds

2253
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:30,320
of people endlessly bashing

2254
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:31,320
someone who's already

2255
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,320
been knocked to the ground

2256
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:34,320
and feeling all the while

2257
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:36,320
like they're punching up.

2258
01:19:36,320 --> 01:19:37,320
You know, there's actually

2259
01:19:37,320 --> 01:19:39,320
a kind of power and safety

2260
01:19:39,320 --> 01:19:41,320
in anonymity and obscurity.

2261
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:42,320
And there are many ways

2262
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:44,320
that being a public figure

2263
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,320
makes you really vulnerable.

2264
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:47,320
For example, you're more vulnerable

2265
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:50,320
to doxing, stalking, and harassment

2266
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:52,320
on a scale that most people

2267
01:19:52,320 --> 01:19:54,320
probably can't even imagine.

2268
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,320
You're vulnerable to having

2269
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,320
your reputation permanently degraded

2270
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:00,320
in a way that people who are

2271
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:01,320
posting anonymously

2272
01:20:01,320 --> 01:20:02,320
or pseudonymously

2273
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,320
are pretty much invulnerable to.

2274
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,320
And a lot of the people

2275
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,320
who are attacking me,

2276
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,320
they're not pausing to self-reflect.

2277
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,320
They're not holding themselves

2278
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,320
accountable for the consequences

2279
01:20:11,320 --> 01:20:13,320
of their actions.

2280
01:20:13,320 --> 01:20:14,320
They're just venting

2281
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,320
their unfiltered rage.

2282
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,320
But in response to these attacks,

2283
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,320
I, as a powerful person

2284
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,320
with a platform,

2285
01:20:21,320 --> 01:20:23,320
I'm not allowed to react

2286
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:24,320
like a human being.

2287
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:26,320
I'm not allowed to get angry.

2288
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:27,320
I'm not allowed to show pain.

2289
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,320
I'm not allowed to get defensive.

2290
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:30,320
I'm not allowed to lash out.

2291
01:20:30,320 --> 01:20:32,320
All I'm allowed to do is

2292
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,320
go totally numb on the inside

2293
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:36,320
as I try to frantically calculate

2294
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:39,320
the ideal public relations response

2295
01:20:39,320 --> 01:20:40,320
that pays due deference

2296
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:41,320
to the valid concerns

2297
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:43,320
of these poor marginalized people,

2298
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:45,320
all the while ignoring

2299
01:20:45,320 --> 01:20:47,320
the tsunami of verbal abuse

2300
01:20:47,320 --> 01:20:48,320
that's crashing over me.

2301
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,320
You know, people on Twitter,

2302
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:52,320
they don't try to persuade me

2303
01:20:52,320 --> 01:20:53,320
like I'm a human being.

2304
01:20:53,320 --> 01:20:55,320
They order me around.

2305
01:20:55,320 --> 01:20:56,320
They tell me what to believe.

2306
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:58,320
They demand that I say

2307
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:00,320
exactly what they want me to say

2308
01:21:00,320 --> 01:21:01,320
or else.

2309
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:03,320
It's extremely objectifying.

2310
01:21:03,320 --> 01:21:05,320
They don't treat me like a person

2311
01:21:05,320 --> 01:21:07,320
with my own opinions and feelings.

2312
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:08,320
They treat me as this like

2313
01:21:08,320 --> 01:21:09,320
brand

2314
01:21:09,320 --> 01:21:11,320
of moral commodity

2315
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,320
to be consumed or denounced.

2316
01:21:13,320 --> 01:21:15,320
And this is all terribly ironic

2317
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:17,320
because of the conflicting demand

2318
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:19,320
that creators be authentic

2319
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:20,320
all the time.

2320
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:21,320
One thing that always frustrates me

2321
01:21:21,320 --> 01:21:23,320
about these situations

2322
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:24,320
is there's this demand

2323
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:27,320
that you apologize instantly

2324
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:28,320
and there's this perception

2325
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,320
that a fast apology

2326
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,320
is more sincere than a delayed one.

2327
01:21:32,320 --> 01:21:33,320
But in fact,

2328
01:21:33,320 --> 01:21:34,320
the opposite is true.

2329
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:36,320
It takes longer than a couple hours

2330
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:37,320
to cool down,

2331
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:38,320
lower your defenses,

2332
01:21:38,320 --> 01:21:40,320
listen,

2333
01:21:40,320 --> 01:21:41,320
learn,

2334
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,320
grow,

2335
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:43,320
seriously reflect

2336
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,320
on what you may have done

2337
01:21:44,320 --> 01:21:45,320
or said that was wrong.

2338
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:47,320
That can take days

2339
01:21:47,320 --> 01:21:48,320
or weeks

2340
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:49,320
or months.

2341
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:51,320
I had to do my October AMA stream

2342
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:52,320
for Patreon

2343
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,320
and at the beginning of the stream,

2344
01:21:54,320 --> 01:21:56,320
I gave my emotional

2345
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:57,320
half-formed reaction

2346
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,320
to the Buck Angel situation.

2347
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,320
And some traitor

2348
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,320
on my Patreon

2349
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,320
transcribed

2350
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:07,320
that part of the stream

2351
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,320
and disseminated it on Twitter

2352
01:22:09,320 --> 01:22:10,320
just to instigate

2353
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:11,320
another round of canceling.

2354
01:22:11,320 --> 01:22:12,320
You're not allowed a chance

2355
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,320
to think or feel.

2356
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,320
And because supposedly

2357
01:22:16,320 --> 01:22:17,320
the best thing to do

2358
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:18,320
from a PR perspective

2359
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,320
is to apologize immediately,

2360
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,320
canceling produces

2361
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:23,320
a lot of insincere

2362
01:22:23,320 --> 01:22:24,320
bullshit apologies

2363
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,320
from people who haven't in fact

2364
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:27,320
learned anything.

2365
01:22:27,320 --> 01:22:28,320
And I think most people

2366
01:22:28,320 --> 01:22:29,320
are aware of that.

2367
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:30,320
In fact,

2368
01:22:30,320 --> 01:22:31,320
I think the demand

2369
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,320
for an apology itself

2370
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,320
is often insincere.

2371
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:36,320
If you're being canceled

2372
01:22:36,320 --> 01:22:38,320
rather than criticized,

2373
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:40,320
then the line in the sand

2374
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:41,320
has been drawn.

2375
01:22:41,320 --> 01:22:42,320
You and all your kin

2376
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:43,320
have been declared

2377
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:44,320
the enemy.

2378
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:46,320
Apologize to Twitter.

2379
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:47,320
At this point,

2380
01:22:47,320 --> 01:22:48,320
I may as well apologize

2381
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,320
to 4chan.

2382
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,320
Dear 4chan,

2383
01:22:50,320 --> 01:22:52,320
I am super fucking sorry

2384
01:22:52,320 --> 01:22:53,320
I called you

2385
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:55,320
thin-wristed otaku shit weasels

2386
01:22:55,320 --> 01:22:56,320
who like looking at pictures

2387
01:22:56,320 --> 01:22:57,320
of little girls.

2388
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:58,320
I have been trying

2389
01:22:58,320 --> 01:22:59,320
to educate myself

2390
01:22:59,320 --> 01:23:01,320
and learn from my mistakes

2391
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:02,320
and I now realize

2392
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:04,320
that's only 70% of you.

2393
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,320
Like, once you're canceled,

2394
01:23:05,320 --> 01:23:07,320
you can really do no right.

2395
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:08,320
If you apologize,

2396
01:23:08,320 --> 01:23:10,320
the apology will be declared

2397
01:23:10,320 --> 01:23:11,320
a manipulative attempt

2398
01:23:11,320 --> 01:23:12,320
to save face

2399
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:13,320
and in fact,

2400
01:23:13,320 --> 01:23:14,320
it will be used

2401
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:15,320
as further evidence

2402
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:16,320
of what a Machiavellian

2403
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:18,320
psychopath you really are.

2404
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,320
If you try to explain

2405
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,320
or defend yourself,

2406
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,320
I mean, first of all,

2407
01:23:21,320 --> 01:23:22,320
you'll almost certainly

2408
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,320
dig yourself in deeper.

2409
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:24,320
But even if you're

2410
01:23:24,320 --> 01:23:26,320
articulate and correct,

2411
01:23:26,320 --> 01:23:27,320
you'll still be seen

2412
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:28,320
as unable to take criticism

2413
01:23:28,320 --> 01:23:30,320
and as ignoring the hurt

2414
01:23:30,320 --> 01:23:31,320
of marginalized people.

2415
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:33,320
And if you just go silent,

2416
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:34,320
you'll be seen as a coward

2417
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:36,320
fleeing accountability.

2418
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:37,320
Even though there's

2419
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,320
lots of reasons

2420
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:39,320
why you might go silent.

2421
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,320
Maybe you're taking

2422
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,320
a few days away

2423
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:42,320
from social media

2424
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,320
to try to cool down

2425
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,320
and think clearly.

2426
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:45,320
Or maybe,

2427
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:46,320
you're so overwhelmed

2428
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:47,320
by the harassment

2429
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:49,320
that you've just shut down.

2430
01:23:54,320 --> 01:23:56,320
Let's do shots.

2431
01:23:56,320 --> 01:23:57,320
Who wants to do a shot with me?

2432
01:23:57,320 --> 01:23:58,320
Do you want to do a shot with me?

2433
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,320
Let's do a shot.

2434
01:24:00,320 --> 01:24:02,320
A tequila shot is my favorite.

2435
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:03,320
I like the whole

2436
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,320
salt, tequila, lime ritual.

2437
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:09,320
It's just very satisfying to me.

2438
01:24:09,320 --> 01:24:12,320
It's the end of that bottle.

2439
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:13,320
Okay.

2440
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:15,320
Let's get started.

2441
01:24:21,320 --> 01:24:22,320
You feel warm right away.

2442
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:23,320
You know that feeling

2443
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:24,320
where it's like,

2444
01:24:24,320 --> 01:24:27,320
oh, hey, how are you, happiness?

2445
01:24:27,320 --> 01:24:29,320
Hey, how are you?

2446
01:24:29,320 --> 01:24:31,320
Feeling that life is worth living?

2447
01:24:31,320 --> 01:24:32,320
It's a good moment.

2448
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,320
You're like, oh, this is good.

2449
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:34,320
This is okay.

2450
01:24:34,320 --> 01:24:35,320
This is gonna be okay.

2451
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:36,320
I can get through this.

2452
01:24:36,320 --> 01:24:37,320
It's how it starts.

2453
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,320
Watch out for that.

2454
01:24:38,320 --> 01:24:39,320
So look,

2455
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,320
I really don't like

2456
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,320
to represent myself

2457
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:42,320
as a victim.

2458
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:44,320
That's not really a narrative

2459
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,320
that I identify with.

2460
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:47,320
But for the purposes

2461
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:48,320
of communicating

2462
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,320
what effect canceling has,

2463
01:24:50,320 --> 01:24:52,320
I feel like I should say something

2464
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,320
about the pain.

2465
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:55,320
Much of the happiness

2466
01:24:55,320 --> 01:24:57,320
that you might expect

2467
01:24:57,320 --> 01:24:58,320
to come along with success

2468
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:01,320
has been taken away from me

2469
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,320
by this constant need

2470
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:05,320
and fury that surrounds me.

2471
01:25:05,320 --> 01:25:07,320
Try to think about this rationally.

2472
01:25:07,320 --> 01:25:09,320
I'm a Libra Sun, Pisces Moon.

2473
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:11,320
Being canceled is hell for me.

2474
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:12,320
You know,

2475
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:14,320
I want to be liked by everyone.

2476
01:25:14,320 --> 01:25:17,320
And I'm starting to think

2477
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,320
I might be in the wrong career for that.

2478
01:25:19,320 --> 01:25:20,320
In a way,

2479
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:22,320
leftist Twitter finally accomplished

2480
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:25,320
what 4chan, Nazis, stalkers, and TERFs

2481
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:27,320
have been trying and failing to do to me

2482
01:25:27,320 --> 01:25:28,320
for years.

2483
01:25:28,320 --> 01:25:30,320
They've made Twitter into a platform

2484
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:32,320
so hostile to my existence

2485
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:34,320
that I've decided to leave it forever.

2486
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:36,320
And they demoralized me to the point

2487
01:25:36,320 --> 01:25:38,320
I could barely get out of bed for a month.

2488
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:40,320
And I know that sounds really melodramatic,

2489
01:25:40,320 --> 01:25:43,320
but I'm just trying to be honest with you

2490
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:46,320
about what a melodramatic person I am.

2491
01:25:46,320 --> 01:25:48,320
I find I have trouble convincing people

2492
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:49,320
of the severity of the pain

2493
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:51,320
that being canceled causes

2494
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:54,320
because I think it's just hard to imagine

2495
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,320
if you haven't been through it yourself.

2496
01:25:56,320 --> 01:25:57,320
And I don't know a more succinct way

2497
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:58,320
to convey it to you

2498
01:25:58,320 --> 01:26:00,320
than by telling you that

2499
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,320
in the last few years,

2500
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:03,320
I've been harassed by Nazis,

2501
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:04,320
I've been harassed by TERFs,

2502
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:05,320
I've been stalked,

2503
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,320
I've been doxxed,

2504
01:26:06,320 --> 01:26:07,320
I've been threatened,

2505
01:26:07,320 --> 01:26:09,320
I've been sexually assaulted.

2506
01:26:09,320 --> 01:26:11,320
And the pain of being canceled,

2507
01:26:11,320 --> 01:26:12,320
of being totally trashed

2508
01:26:12,320 --> 01:26:15,320
by other trans people online for years,

2509
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,320
has been more difficult for me to cope with

2510
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,320
than all the rest of it combined.

2511
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:21,320
Joe Freeman actually describes how I feel

2512
01:26:21,320 --> 01:26:23,320
better than I think I can describe it myself.

2513
01:26:23,320 --> 01:26:25,320
I was one of the first in the country,

2514
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:27,320
perhaps the first in Chicago,

2515
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:28,320
to have my character,

2516
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:29,320
my commitment,

2517
01:26:29,320 --> 01:26:30,320
and my very self attacked

2518
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,320
in such a way by movement women

2519
01:26:32,320 --> 01:26:34,320
that it left me torn in little pieces

2520
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:36,320
and unable to function.

2521
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:37,320
It took me years to recover,

2522
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:38,320
and even today the wounds

2523
01:26:38,320 --> 01:26:39,320
have not entirely healed.

2524
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,320
This attack is accomplished

2525
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,320
by making you feel

2526
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,320
that your very existence

2527
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:45,320
is inimical to the movement

2528
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:47,320
and that nothing can change this

2529
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:49,320
short of ceasing to exist.

2530
01:26:49,320 --> 01:26:50,320
These feelings are reinforced

2531
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,320
when you are isolated from your friends

2532
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:53,320
as they become convinced

2533
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,320
that their association with you

2534
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:57,320
is similarly inimical to the movement

2535
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,320
and to themselves.

2536
01:26:58,320 --> 01:26:59,320
Any support of you

2537
01:26:59,320 --> 01:27:00,320
will taint them.

2538
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:02,320
Eventually all your colleagues join in

2539
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:04,320
in a chorus of condemnation

2540
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:05,320
which cannot be silenced

2541
01:27:05,320 --> 01:27:07,320
and you are reduced to a mere parody

2542
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:09,320
of your previous self.

2543
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:12,320
Yeah, that just about sums it up.

2544
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:13,320
Now as it happens,

2545
01:27:13,320 --> 01:27:14,320
I am going to survive this

2546
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,320
because I have very deliberately built

2547
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,320
a support network that will be there for me

2548
01:27:19,320 --> 01:27:23,320
regardless of what online trans communities say.

2549
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,320
And I have very deliberately done that

2550
01:27:25,320 --> 01:27:28,320
because early in my transition back in 2017

2551
01:27:28,320 --> 01:27:31,320
I relied very heavily

2552
01:27:31,320 --> 01:27:33,320
on the online leftist trans community

2553
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,320
for all kinds of emotional support.

2554
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:37,320
You know, when you're early in transition

2555
01:27:37,320 --> 01:27:39,320
I mean, it just sucks.

2556
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,320
You feel like the whole world is against you.

2557
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,320
And I talked about this a little bit

2558
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,320
in my last video, you know,

2559
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:45,320
feeling like a freak show

2560
01:27:45,320 --> 01:27:46,320
walking down the street.

2561
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,320
And even if you're lucky enough

2562
01:27:47,320 --> 01:27:49,320
to have a supportive family,

2563
01:27:49,320 --> 01:27:51,320
like, it usually still is going to take them

2564
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:52,320
a while to come around.

2565
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,320
At first they don't get it.

2566
01:27:53,320 --> 01:27:55,320
They say things to you like,

2567
01:27:55,320 --> 01:27:57,320
aren't you worried you'll regret this?

2568
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,320
And like, they struggle with your name and pronouns,

2569
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:00,320
which is understandable.

2570
01:28:00,320 --> 01:28:02,320
But at the same time,

2571
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,320
it makes you feel like you're not being seen

2572
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:05,320
for who you are.

2573
01:28:05,320 --> 01:28:07,320
So you need a kind of second family

2574
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:09,320
that understands how you're feeling

2575
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:11,320
and acts happy about your transition

2576
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,320
and validates your gender.

2577
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:15,320
And for the first couple months of my transition,

2578
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:19,320
I found that in this world of online transgender leftism.

2579
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:21,320
Well, that didn't last long because,

2580
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:22,320
well, I was what,

2581
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:24,320
two months into my transition when

2582
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,320
first I did an interview with the journalist

2583
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:27,320
Jessie Single,

2584
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:29,320
and then I agreed to do a debate

2585
01:28:29,320 --> 01:28:30,320
with Theron and Vanessa.

2586
01:28:30,320 --> 01:28:31,320
So that's a long story,

2587
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:32,320
but in short,

2588
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:34,320
I associated with a string of people

2589
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:37,320
that trans Twitter considers the enemy.

2590
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:39,320
And trans Twitter tore me apart over this.

2591
01:28:39,320 --> 01:28:41,320
And it completely broke my heart

2592
01:28:41,320 --> 01:28:44,320
because I was really leaning

2593
01:28:44,320 --> 01:28:47,320
on basically emotional support

2594
01:28:47,320 --> 01:28:48,320
from strangers online,

2595
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:50,320
which seems really stupid in retrospect.

2596
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:52,320
And after they turned against me,

2597
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,320
I decided one,

2598
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,320
that I was never going to rely

2599
01:28:54,320 --> 01:28:55,320
on this group of people again.

2600
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:56,320
And two,

2601
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:59,320
that I was going to have to find acceptance elsewhere.

2602
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,320
And in retrospect,

2603
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:02,320
I think this actually may have been good for me

2604
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:03,320
in a roundabout way

2605
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,320
because I was kicked out of the safe space

2606
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:07,320
and I dropped that mentality.

2607
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:08,320
And so basically,

2608
01:29:08,320 --> 01:29:10,320
I was thrown into the deep end of reality

2609
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,320
and forced to sink or swim.

2610
01:29:11,320 --> 01:29:13,320
And I don't know if my transition

2611
01:29:13,320 --> 01:29:15,320
or my channel would be where they are today

2612
01:29:15,320 --> 01:29:17,320
if it hadn't been for that trial by fire.

2613
01:29:17,320 --> 01:29:18,320
Are we swimming through fire

2614
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:20,320
or are we mixing metaphors?

2615
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:24,320
The point is I'm more armored against canceling

2616
01:29:24,320 --> 01:29:25,320
than I was two years ago.

2617
01:29:25,320 --> 01:29:27,320
And the reason why is I have acquired

2618
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:29,320
a certain level of privilege and security

2619
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,320
and independence from any one community

2620
01:29:31,320 --> 01:29:33,320
so that if one community cancels me,

2621
01:29:33,320 --> 01:29:35,320
I still have somewhere else to go.

2622
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:36,320
You know,

2623
01:29:36,320 --> 01:29:38,320
the people who are most vulnerable to cancel culture

2624
01:29:38,320 --> 01:29:40,320
are not white guy comedians.

2625
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:41,320
They're not James Charles.

2626
01:29:41,320 --> 01:29:42,320
They're not me.

2627
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,320
They are marginalized people

2628
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,320
who feel like they have nowhere else to go

2629
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:47,320
when they're rejected by their community.

2630
01:29:47,320 --> 01:29:50,320
That means struggling trans people

2631
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,320
with a few hundred Twitter followers.

2632
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,320
It means a lot of sex workers.

2633
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,320
It means people

2634
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:57,320
who totally rely on activist circles

2635
01:29:57,320 --> 01:29:59,320
for emotional and material support.

2636
01:29:59,320 --> 01:30:01,320
I'll quote Joe Freeman one more time.

2637
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:02,320
I had survived my youth

2638
01:30:02,320 --> 01:30:04,320
because I had never given anyone

2639
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:06,320
or any group the right to judge me.

2640
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,320
That right I had reserved to myself.

2641
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,320
But the movement seduced me

2642
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,320
by its sweet promise of sisterhood.

2643
01:30:12,320 --> 01:30:14,320
It claimed to provide a haven

2644
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:16,320
from the ravages of a sexist society,

2645
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:18,320
a place where one would be understood.

2646
01:30:18,320 --> 01:30:21,320
It was my very need for feminism and feminists

2647
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:23,320
that made me vulnerable.

2648
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:26,320
I gave the movement the right to judge me

2649
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:27,320
because I trusted it.

2650
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,320
And when it judged me worthless,

2651
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,320
I accepted that judgment.

2652
01:30:31,320 --> 01:30:33,320
There's a really irritating point

2653
01:30:33,320 --> 01:30:35,320
that people on the left like to make that goes,

2654
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:38,320
well, canceling doesn't really end anyone's career.

2655
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:40,320
Canceled people usually get a new job

2656
01:30:40,320 --> 01:30:41,320
or keep their platform.

2657
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,320
So I guess it's not really that bad, huh?

2658
01:30:44,320 --> 01:30:45,320
I think people say this

2659
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:48,320
because they're trying to mitigate any sense of guilt

2660
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:50,320
they might feel about how they're treating people

2661
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,320
because it's a really stupid argument.

2662
01:30:52,320 --> 01:30:54,320
There's lots of things that don't end your life

2663
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:55,320
that are still terrible.

2664
01:30:55,320 --> 01:30:57,320
But also, there's cases where canceling

2665
01:30:57,320 --> 01:30:59,320
has ended someone's life.

2666
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,320
On December 5th, 2017,

2667
01:31:01,320 --> 01:31:03,320
a porn star named August Ames

2668
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,320
killed herself by hanging in a public park

2669
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:07,320
after being canceled on Twitter

2670
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,320
over a homophobic tweet.

2671
01:31:09,320 --> 01:31:11,320
On December 3rd, she tweeted,

2672
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,320
Whichever lady is replacing me tomorrow

2673
01:31:13,320 --> 01:31:14,320
for erotica x news,

2674
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:16,320
you're shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn

2675
01:31:16,320 --> 01:31:17,320
just to let you know.

2676
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:19,320
BS is all I can say, shrug.

2677
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:21,320
Do agents really not care about who they're representing?

2678
01:31:21,320 --> 01:31:24,320
LA Direct, I do my homework for my body.

2679
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:26,320
So I've never worked in porn,

2680
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,320
so I can't really tell you what the norms are

2681
01:31:28,320 --> 01:31:32,320
around women working with men who have done gay porn.

2682
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:34,320
But the tweet certainly sounds homophobic to me,

2683
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:36,320
and that seemed to be the consensus

2684
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,320
of other industry people on Twitter.

2685
01:31:38,320 --> 01:31:39,320
So Twitter did its thing.

2686
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:42,320
People in August's community called her a homophobe

2687
01:31:42,320 --> 01:31:43,320
and lashed out at her.

2688
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:44,320
And as always happens,

2689
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:46,320
plenty of passersby jumped in

2690
01:31:46,320 --> 01:31:48,320
to throw tomatoes at the woman in the stocks.

2691
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:49,320
Over the next few days,

2692
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:51,320
August tweeted several more times,

2693
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:53,320
going through the usual stages that you go through

2694
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:54,320
when you're being canceled.

2695
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:56,320
First, she defended herself.

2696
01:31:56,320 --> 01:31:58,320
She claimed most other women in the industry

2697
01:31:58,320 --> 01:31:59,320
feel the same as her.

2698
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,320
Then she said she's bisexual,

2699
01:32:01,320 --> 01:32:03,320
and therefore she couldn't be homophobic.

2700
01:32:03,320 --> 01:32:05,320
Then she said, fine, August will be fake

2701
01:32:05,320 --> 01:32:06,320
and not have opinions then.

2702
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,320
Then she started bemoaning how mean Twitter is.

2703
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,320
And she got really defensive

2704
01:32:09,320 --> 01:32:11,320
about her right to choose who she has sex with.

2705
01:32:11,320 --> 01:32:14,320
And she lashed out at the people attacking her.

2706
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:16,320
And then in her final tweet,

2707
01:32:16,320 --> 01:32:18,320
she just said, fuck y'all,

2708
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,320
and went to the park that night and killed herself.

2709
01:32:21,320 --> 01:32:23,320
This is all so familiar to me.

2710
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:25,320
I feel like I'm able to relive with her

2711
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:27,320
each stage of this emotional process.

2712
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,320
There's that first moment

2713
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:30,320
when you realize the outrage is beginning

2714
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:32,320
and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach.

2715
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,320
And then the anger, feeling misunderstood.

2716
01:32:35,320 --> 01:32:37,320
And then the bargaining, the fear,

2717
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:39,320
and finally the shame and the despair.

2718
01:32:39,320 --> 01:32:40,320
And here's the thing,

2719
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,320
I totally agree with her critics

2720
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,320
that her tweet was bad.

2721
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,320
Of course she has the right to say no for any reason,

2722
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:50,320
but she publicly expressed this in a homophobic way.

2723
01:32:50,320 --> 01:32:54,320
But she was still a person who deserves to live.

2724
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:55,320
And I think there's gotta be a better way

2725
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:57,320
to deal with these situations

2726
01:32:57,320 --> 01:33:00,320
than just trashing someone until they kill themselves.

2727
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:01,320
And I know it's never as simple

2728
01:33:01,320 --> 01:33:03,320
as Twitter made her kill herself.

2729
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:06,320
There's always other things going on in the background.

2730
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:07,320
But the point I'm making is,

2731
01:33:07,320 --> 01:33:10,320
canceling is more dangerous to marginalized people

2732
01:33:10,320 --> 01:33:13,320
because marginalized people generally have more things

2733
01:33:13,320 --> 01:33:15,320
going on in the background.

2734
01:33:15,320 --> 01:33:18,320
John Ronson did an investigative podcast about her death

2735
01:33:18,320 --> 01:33:20,320
and it goes into how she was saved

2736
01:33:20,320 --> 01:33:23,320
and sexually abused as a child, abandoned by her father.

2737
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:24,320
She was living with a boyfriend

2738
01:33:24,320 --> 01:33:26,320
she was kind of emotionally detached from.

2739
01:33:26,320 --> 01:33:27,320
And a few weeks earlier,

2740
01:33:27,320 --> 01:33:28,320
she'd filmed a scene with a guy

2741
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,320
who was unnecessarily rough and mean

2742
01:33:31,320 --> 01:33:32,320
and who mistreated her.

2743
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:34,320
So she was kind of traumatized by that.

2744
01:33:34,320 --> 01:33:36,320
And so she was kind of on edge

2745
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:38,320
and really defensive about who she worked with

2746
01:33:38,320 --> 01:33:39,320
when she was tweeting.

2747
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,320
Then the backlash happened.

2748
01:33:41,320 --> 01:33:44,320
And since she had no other support network,

2749
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,320
she probably felt like the only community she had

2750
01:33:46,320 --> 01:33:47,320
turned against her.

2751
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,320
And that's a really painful feeling.

2752
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:52,320
She must have felt so despised.

2753
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:55,320
Which is how I've felt for the last two months.

2754
01:33:55,320 --> 01:33:59,320
I feel despised and burdensome.

2755
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:02,320
And I can imagine how a person who feels that way

2756
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:04,320
could have an impulsive couple hours

2757
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:07,320
where they think their best option is suicide.

2758
01:34:07,320 --> 01:34:08,320
I mean, I can more than imagine it

2759
01:34:08,320 --> 01:34:10,320
because I've been there myself.

2760
01:34:10,320 --> 01:34:11,320
And I'm still here

2761
01:34:11,320 --> 01:34:12,320
because at those moments,

2762
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:15,320
I've been with good friends who took care of me.

2763
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:16,320
And by friends,

2764
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,320
I do mean Xanax.

2765
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:21,320
But I've also survived because

2766
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:23,320
there's a lot of people on the internet

2767
01:34:23,320 --> 01:34:25,320
who'd be very entertained if I killed myself.

2768
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:28,320
And I simply refuse to give them the satisfaction.

2769
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:29,320
Oh no, bitch.

2770
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:32,320
I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite.

2771
01:34:32,320 --> 01:34:34,320
I mean, who needs a guardian angel

2772
01:34:34,320 --> 01:34:36,320
when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas

2773
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,320
on the fumes of total contempt?

2774
01:34:38,320 --> 01:34:40,320
What I'm really trying to say is,

2775
01:34:40,320 --> 01:34:43,320
Merry Christmas, you goddamn assholes.

2776
01:34:48,320 --> 01:35:04,320
Oh, holy night.

2777
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:11,320
The stars are brightly shining.

2778
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:14,320
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

2779
01:35:14,320 --> 01:35:17,320
Meow, meow, meow, meow.

2780
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:18,320
Meow.

2781
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:19,320
Meow, meow.

2782
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,320
To get my lesbian pliers out again.

2783
01:35:28,320 --> 01:35:31,320
Have a super fucking happy New Year, George.

2784
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:34,320
How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment?

2785
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:36,320
Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub?

2786
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:38,320
Leave a comment if you want a bathtub.

2787
01:35:38,320 --> 01:35:40,320
All right, I need to take a deep breath

2788
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,320
because let's be honest,

2789
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,320
I'm about one crack away

2790
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,320
from attacking my own Twitter followers with an umbrella.

2791
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,320
I am about one breakdown away

2792
01:35:47,320 --> 01:35:48,320
from going on a rampage

2793
01:35:48,320 --> 01:35:50,320
and making a suit out of women's skin.

2794
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:51,320
Just kidding.

2795
01:35:51,320 --> 01:35:52,320
I would never do that.

2796
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:53,320
Though on a bad skin day,

2797
01:35:53,320 --> 01:35:55,320
I've given it serious consideration.

2798
01:35:55,320 --> 01:35:57,320
Oh, I'll be fine.

2799
01:35:57,320 --> 01:35:58,320
I've gotta sober up anyway

2800
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,320
because I'm having more plastic surgery in a couple days.

2801
01:36:01,320 --> 01:36:03,320
And plastic surgery,

2802
01:36:03,320 --> 01:36:06,320
that's about the only thing holding me together at this point.

2803
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,320
What?

2804
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:08,320
YouTubing?

2805
01:36:08,320 --> 01:36:09,320
This is a healthy profession.

2806
01:36:09,320 --> 01:36:11,320
This is great.

2807
01:36:11,320 --> 01:36:12,320
Anyone want my job?

2808
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:14,320
Step right up.

2809
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:15,320
All you have to do is make informative

2810
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,320
and entertaining videos

2811
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,320
about extremely controversial topics

2812
01:36:18,320 --> 01:36:19,320
while, of course,

2813
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:21,320
representing the full range of experiences

2814
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:23,320
in the LGBTQIAA plus spectrum

2815
01:36:23,320 --> 01:36:26,320
and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny.

2816
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,320
Well, go on.

2817
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:29,320
I'm waiting to be entertained.

2818
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:30,320
Feed me, mother.

2819
01:36:30,320 --> 01:36:31,320
Oh, don't mind me.

2820
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,320
I'll just sit back

2821
01:36:32,320 --> 01:36:34,320
and pour another glass of wine.

2822
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:35,320
Oh, and I will, of course,

2823
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:37,320
be obsessively scrutinizing

2824
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:38,320
every word you say

2825
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:40,320
for any hint of moral transgression

2826
01:36:40,320 --> 01:36:41,320
as well as critiquing your look,

2827
01:36:41,320 --> 01:36:43,320
you third-rate cross-dresser.

2828
01:36:43,320 --> 01:36:44,320
Zero out of ten.

2829
01:36:44,320 --> 01:36:45,320
Get off my stage.

2830
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,320
He successfully spilled that everywhere.

2831
01:36:47,320 --> 01:36:48,320
It's good.

2832
01:36:48,320 --> 01:36:50,320
I do still want to talk about

2833
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:51,320
why people cancel

2834
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:52,320
and the effect that it's having,

2835
01:36:52,320 --> 01:36:54,320
but it looks like there's gonna have to be

2836
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:55,320
a part two gorge

2837
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,320
because I have hit my limit.

2838
01:36:57,320 --> 01:36:59,320
So why don't we all cut our losses

2839
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:01,320
and try again in 2020, hm?

2840
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:02,320
I realize that people on Twitter

2841
01:37:02,320 --> 01:37:04,320
aren't actually gonna watch this video.

2842
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:06,320
They're just gonna make fun of the title

2843
01:37:06,320 --> 01:37:07,320
and how long it is.

2844
01:37:07,320 --> 01:37:08,320
Which, fair enough,

2845
01:37:08,320 --> 01:37:09,320
but they're the ones

2846
01:37:09,320 --> 01:37:10,320
whose accusations against me

2847
01:37:10,320 --> 01:37:12,320
are so numerous and convoluted

2848
01:37:12,320 --> 01:37:14,320
it required a feature-length film

2849
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,320
to respond to.

2850
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:16,320
But yeah, they're gonna see the title

2851
01:37:16,320 --> 01:37:17,320
and they're gonna transcribe

2852
01:37:17,320 --> 01:37:19,320
quotes out of context

2853
01:37:19,320 --> 01:37:20,320
and they're gonna say

2854
01:37:20,320 --> 01:37:21,320
I'm a fascist,

2855
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:22,320
I'm a TERF,

2856
01:37:22,320 --> 01:37:23,320
I'm true scum,

2857
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:24,320
I'm the new Blair White,

2858
01:37:24,320 --> 01:37:25,320
I'm the new Lacey Green,

2859
01:37:25,320 --> 01:37:26,320
I'm a cis bootlicker,

2860
01:37:26,320 --> 01:37:28,320
I'm an enlightened centrist,

2861
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,320
I'm a shitlib,

2862
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,320
I'm alt-right,

2863
01:37:30,320 --> 01:37:31,320
I'm a heartless grifter

2864
01:37:31,320 --> 01:37:32,320
raking in millions of dollars

2865
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:34,320
over the bodies of dead trans women.

2866
01:37:34,320 --> 01:37:35,320
Mask off.

2867
01:37:35,320 --> 01:37:36,320
Yikes.

2868
01:37:36,320 --> 01:37:37,320
This ain't it, chief.

2869
01:37:37,320 --> 01:37:38,320
Friendly reminder

2870
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,320
that this isn't a good look.

2871
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:42,320
Maybe don't be a cis bootlicker?

2872
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:43,320
Disappointing.

2873
01:37:43,320 --> 01:37:44,320
But there's something

2874
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:45,320
about them saying

2875
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:46,320
all those things already

2876
01:37:46,320 --> 01:37:47,320
so I'm inoculated.

2877
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:48,320
See, their mistake

2878
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:49,320
was completely breaking my spirit.

2879
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:50,320
They should have left

2880
01:37:50,320 --> 01:37:51,320
a little piece intact.

2881
01:37:51,320 --> 01:37:52,320
But it's good.

2882
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:53,320
It's good.

2883
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:54,320
It's good.

2884
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:55,320
Because, basically,

2885
01:37:55,320 --> 01:37:57,320
my survival from here on out

2886
01:37:57,320 --> 01:37:59,320
hinges on my ability

2887
01:37:59,320 --> 01:38:01,320
to not care at all

2888
01:38:01,320 --> 01:38:03,320
what people say about me online.

2889
01:38:03,320 --> 01:38:05,320
So...

2890
