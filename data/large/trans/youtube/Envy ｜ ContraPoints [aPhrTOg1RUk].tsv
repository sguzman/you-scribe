0	19760	So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.
19760	26000	I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.
26000	30240	You have to dial in.
30240	33780	Hello operator, connect me to hell.
33780	41240	This was the day that Fyre Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,
41240	45100	was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.
45100	49620	There was a lot of hype, Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram,
49620	54760	there was a promo video full of supermodels, tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.
54760	60120	One Twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption, and
60120	66260	many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.
66260	72220	So when the day arrived and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure turned
72220	77460	out to be two slices of pallid American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere
77460	82260	that can only be described as muddy third world shantytown, I mean, if you weren't
82260	84740	on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine.
84740	87160	The revelry.
87160	92420	Just learned about Fyre Festival, aka Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models
92420	93800	and rich white kids.
93800	96960	Yuppie Hunger Games hosted by Ja Rule.
96960	101200	Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fyre Festival.
101200	105400	Instagram entitled rich kids, meet Lord of the Flies.
105400	107400	Let them eat salad.
107400	113000	It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.
113000	114200	You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders.
114200	119220	But at least those sandwiches were garbage.
119220	128180	Jamila Jameel is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.
128180	129820	Imagine looking like this.
129820	130820	Imagine being perfect.
130820	133040	Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?
133040	135560	Why are you doing this to women?
135560	140620	One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen, Jamila, your skin is so perfect,
140620	141620	uwu.
141620	142620	And Jamila replied,
142620	143660	My skin is currently perfect.
143660	145200	My skin is currently clear because
145200	152260	A. Privileged people have more access to good quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly
152260	155400	less stressful than those with less privilege.
155400	157700	I also get to sleep more because of this.
157700	161940	All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances
161940	162940	easily.
162940	166900	B. I believe that trans rights are human rights.
166900	169660	C. I exfoliate twice a week.
169660	170660	Oh boy.
170660	172660	Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, Gorge.
172660	173660	I'll protect you, queen.
173660	176100	Could she be any more annoying?
176100	178940	Someone wandered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.
178940	183200	This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.
183200	187500	Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.
187500	192040	Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.
192040	198820	But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that
198820	201660	account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of the sting out of inequality.
201660	202660	I'm not saying she's not pretty.
202660	203660	I'm not saying she's not beautiful.
203660	204660	I'm just saying she's got a lot of quality.
204660	205660	Does it?
205660	210400	And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check
210400	211400	your privilege.
211400	216140	A suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart, since the rich and famous
216140	221800	now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared to the rabble.
221800	226100	And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to
226100	227100	it.
227100	228100	I don't have any beauty secrets.
228100	231100	I guess I just drink lots of water.
231100	232660	Take me, mother.
232660	237960	A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height
237960	240160	of the coronavirus pandemic.
240160	243280	Forty and feeling so humbled and blessed.
243280	247380	There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when
247380	250300	we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.
250300	255200	After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised
255200	259760	my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were
259760	261660	normal for just a brief moment in time.
261660	262660	I realized that I was not alone.
262660	266020	I realized that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right
266020	267020	now.
267020	271900	So in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.
271900	274160	Hashtag this is 40.
274160	275580	Tag me, bitch.
275580	280680	So like Jamila, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege checking maneuver.
280680	283500	And once again, it has not gone well.
283500	289160	You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century bragging about being humble and letting us
289160	290160	eat cake.
290160	292080	Millions of Americans sick and suffering.
292080	298700	Standing for hours in food lines and being evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege.
298700	304400	Your tweet made ten times worse by hashtag tone deaf, humbled and blessed line, hashtag
304400	305400	gross.
305400	306400	Happy birthday.
306400	307400	Mmm.
307400	311440	I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read them motherfuckin'.
311440	316800	So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about
316800	318440	was not that she had the party.
318440	321440	I mean, wouldn't you escape to a private island if you got that MILF money?
321440	329060	The problem was more that she tweeted about it, and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,
329060	330720	a little bit yikesy.
330720	335740	But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?
335740	337400	This isn't a good look.
337400	339900	We say bad optics.
339900	341900	Not relatable.
341900	343520	Relatable.
343520	346160	Relatability is not a moral category.
346160	349960	This is public relations, it's not ethics, and it definitely isn't socialism.
349960	350960	Like, I'm pretty sure Karl Marx is a socialist.
350960	352480	I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said,
352480	357200	The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.
357200	360560	They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.
360560	363260	This should have stayed in the drafts.
363260	364260	Hashtag tone deaf.
364260	369520	Isn't the issue that, when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine?
369520	372280	We didn't get to have birthday parties.
372280	376000	Some people couldn't even travel to visit their dying relatives.
376000	380580	So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was…
380960	382580	painful.
382580	386920	Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.
386920	393840	And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury
393840	401740	music festivals, or Kim K's birthday party, or Jameela Jamil's privileged pores, no
401740	403640	one ever uses the word envy.
403640	409360	It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our
409360	410360	own psychology.
410360	414860	So in this video, I want to take a long, hard look at envy.
414860	415860	What is it?
415860	417260	Where does it come from?
417260	420020	And seriously, what is Jameela Jamil's skincare routine?
420020	421480	Drop it in the comments, bestie!
421480	423600	Okay, so what is envy?
423600	428840	Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.
428840	435220	Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have
435220	437980	what we want, but cannot get.
437980	439980	It's not simply wanting what another person has.
439980	444080	That's greed, which is a much more wholesome sin.
444080	449340	Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,
449340	452020	it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.
452020	456100	And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy.
456100	458420	It's emulation, or admiration.
458420	460480	At worst, it's what the Bible calls coveting.
460480	461480	It covets.
461480	467480	Envy is something darker, it's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging
467480	468820	them what they have.
468820	469820	You might even hate the person.
469820	469940	You might even hate the person.
469940	469960	You might even hate the person.
469980	473420	You might even hate the person you envy, and want them to lose what they have, to be
473420	479660	humiliated and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.
479660	484520	Like Satan, who is willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John
484520	485520	Milfton.
485520	488160	It's gonna be 90 minutes of MILF jokes, kids, so strap in.
488160	492060	So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.
492060	498420	For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary
498420	499420	celibates.
499420	502580	Men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.
502580	508420	It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is beautiful, wealthy,
508420	509900	masculine men.
509900	516040	For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only
516040	521880	want to date chads, or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.
521880	525220	Gas keep, gate boss, girl light.
525220	529380	So if you're an incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's a
529380	534700	bad emulation, the aspiration to attain what another person has, or, and this is the more
534700	540360	popular option, you can take the black pill, which means believing that chadhood is genetically
540360	544980	determined at birth, there is no hope, no woman will ever want you, and therefore happiness
544980	548160	is impossible, you may as well lie down and rot.
548160	554300	This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire Wikipedia
554300	556700	timeline dedicated to tracking them.
556700	557380	And the essential motivation for this violence is...
557380	557880	The black pill.
557880	558380	The black pill.
558380	558880	The black pill.
558880	559380	The black pill.
559380	560660	Inまり's day, one indication of it all, is, envy.
561060	562500	The incels failed ambition.
562500	567580	And sense of incurable, predestined inferiority turns venomous.
567580	573580	The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I want,
573740	575260	then no one can.
575260	577160	In the words of a murderer.
577160	582380	The day of retribution, is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have."
582600	588700	But most incels aren't murderers, most of the time envy is most harmful to the person
588700	589200	who envies.
589380	594080	The philosopher Max Scheler called it a self-poisoning of the mind.
594500	598360	There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.
598840	600560	Because the other sins are fun, right?
601120	602960	Greed, gluttony, lust.
603480	605120	That's what I call a good time.
605360	607300	But envy is misery.
607720	610360	Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.
610680	616580	Fire Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives would
616580	618320	be like without rich parents.
618320	619780	Parents, yes.
620000	621760	Rich refugee crisis.
622340	625360	We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.
625820	626620	Look around you.
626800	628380	We've got the guillotine memes.
628580	631240	We've got edgy teens tweeting eat the rich.
631460	632580	And none of this is new.
632960	637820	The slogan eat the rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,
638040	640420	Jacques Gabor, who supposedly said,
640680	646820	When the people have no more to eat, they will eat the rich.
646820	647640	And fair enough.
647780	648300	It's a good source.
648480	648980	It's a protein.
648980	650320	But take it from me, kids.
650320	653720	Cannibalism is one of those tricky things.
653720	655360	It's hard to do just once.
655360	656800	You develop a taste for it.
656800	658700	It's like they say at NA meetings.
658700	661000	Once you've wore, you just want more.
661000	663100	Also, who counts as the rich?
663100	664100	Am I the rich?
664100	668300	I certainly hope so, because I want you to eat me.
668300	670300	Stop it.
670300	671500	See this is why I quit academia.
671500	674840	If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.
674840	676500	And I don't want to behave myself.
676500	677500	I want to be bad.
677500	678100	Do you want to be bad?
678100	679300	Do you want to be bad with me?
679300	680700	Let's be bad.
680700	706860	So you might think that envy is simply the
706860	707220	The rich.
707220	707560	The rich.
707560	712440	simply the product of inequality, and that societies that have more inequality have more
712440	717320	envy. I used to assume that too, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that might not
717320	723560	be true. Envy is a basic part of human nature. It exists in all societies and all economic systems,
723560	728120	and it begins anytime two or more people start comparing themselves.
728120	730760	Part 2. The Desire for Mommy's Milk
730760	739640	According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, Daddy, the first stage of human development is
739640	745560	the oral stage, in which the primary concern is oral gratification, which is of course provided
745560	750040	by mommy milkies. Am I doing too much? I'll tone it down, just a little bit.
750040	754680	So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud, and it's true,
754680	760600	he was a bit of a crackpot coke fiend who had some zany ideas. Like penis envy. Maybe there's
760600	760740	truth to that, but I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
760740	760880	know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Hmm.
760880	764260	Transgender men who experienced that. But I don't think it's a basic
764260	769140	factor for the female condition. As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?
769140	772900	Because I take that personally. I'm giving it very serious consideration, doctor,
772900	777780	but I feel like even when Freud is wrong he's often at least onto something. Like,
777780	783460	with the oedipus complex, it's not that you literally desire your mother right that would
783460	790580	be weird, it's more that you desire an archetype. Mother. Right? Mommy. You guys get it. Gen Z
790580	795360	tiktok lesbians get it they're the ones who got me started on this milf shit i'm a reverse socrates
795360	801180	i've been corrupted by the young my innocent and delicate nature has been defiled so freud says
801180	806900	that in the first two years of life libido is primarily focused on mommy's milk and it's also
806900	813340	in this stage that envy first emerges so i was the oldest child in my family and i was less than two
813340	817900	years old when my brother was born so i don't remember this because i was one year old but my
817900	824040	family tells me that when my brother was born i was just insanely jealous oh and i guess now is a
824040	829260	good time to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy scholars agree that there is a
829260	835780	difference and usually and usually they describe the difference in one of two ways the first is
835780	840740	that jealousy is defensive it's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours
840740	847060	whereas envy is offensive it's resentment over what someone else has that you lack and the second
847060	847880	difference is that
847880	853220	envy is between two people the envier and the envied whereas jealousy typically involves three
853220	859080	people as in romantic jealousy where you have the subject the romantic object and then the rival and
859080	864020	the subject is jealous of the rival because they're protective of their relationship with the romantic
864020	869340	object and that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry just substituting the romantic object
869340	874080	for mommy of course in ordinary english people are always going to say jealousy when they really mean
874080	877860	envy probably because jealousy has less negative connotations
877880	882880	and i think it's pointless to try to fight that like i wouldn't go around correcting people but
882880	888800	just keep in mind that there is a difference so sibling rivalry is that envy or jealousy well i
888800	894240	think it's both because initially you're defensive of your privileged only child relationship with
894240	900160	your parents but a new baby often gets more attention at least in your paranoid toddler brain
900160	906000	and you might be envious of that and in romantic jealousy you may also envy the rival if she has
906000	907720	qualities that you wish you had
907880	913200	you know young kids are little egotists who are very sensitive to when another child might be
913200	920480	getting preferential treatment one of the favorite phrases of tiny babies is it's not fair it's not
921040	929360	fair tell me about it bambino and i've got bad news life is not getting any more fair than this
929360	934400	according to the bible one of the first events in human history is the story of cain
937040	937680	i don't know why
937880	942080	i said it in spanish i guess i just thought it would sound cool was i wrong
943200	949920	it just sounds so much better than cain king and abel cain and abel god tells cain and abel
949920	957440	each to make a sacrifice and then god prefers abel's you know because god loves meat then
957440	961760	in an act of malicious envy toward abel in spite towards god the father
961760	967600	kain kills his younger brother in my earliest memories of my brother i already loved him
967880	972320	and i don't remember the envy so i guess i wasn't a cain cain
972320	976320	so i must have somehow worked through this without resorting to murder
977300	983900	freud says that the older sibling's envy of the younger leads to a recognition of impotence because
983900	989940	at first you selfishly want to be the special most loved child but you see that your parents love
989940	995340	your sibling just as much as you and you're powerless to do anything about it so your ambition
995340	1002460	to superiority fails and so you have no choice but to repress your ambition to superiority as well as
1002460	1009340	your envy and the result of that repression is what we could call herd instinct solidarity this
1009340	1015260	feeling of identifying with a group the equal siblings and as you get older the herd instinct
1015260	1021980	evolves into feelings about justice duty community and equality but freud thought these feelings
1021980	1029660	retain a vestige of repressed envy if i can't be the favorite if i can't have special privileges
1030380	1037980	then no one can and from these observations freud made the generalization social justice means that
1037980	1046140	we deny ourselves many things so that others may have to do without them as well okay so we don't
1046140	1051900	want other people to have anything we can't have so we enviously insist on equality
1051980	1057580	as a defense against the greater prosperity of others now i don't think i completely agree with
1057580	1062220	that like i think freud is definitely onto something here but don't some of our community
1062220	1070700	feelings also come from a place of genuine care for other people i cared for someone once
1072300	1081340	wrong well we'll come back to that later let's put a pin in me for now a pin in it for now in order to
1081340	1081900	make it work for you
1081980	1085180	freud i mean let's put a pin in freud
1086700	1093980	in a 1966 book titled envy a theory of social behavior the sociologist helmut shook argued
1093980	1098860	that rather than being that is a very german name helmut shook it's putting me in a german mood
1098860	1105980	sweetie hello myna liban hoyta gifts i know yes video i just get worse at german every year shook
1105980	1111340	argued that rather than being the result of social or economic inequality envy is a universal across
1111340	1117900	all human societies including very egalitarian ones for example in tribal and village cultures
1117900	1123820	around the world there's often a concept of black magic or witchcraft which are thought to be used
1123820	1128940	by envious people to bewitch the ones they envy you're probably familiar with the concept of the
1128940	1134140	evil eye which originates in ancient greece or maybe even earlier than that cultures all over
1134140	1141260	the world today understand the evil eye as a kind of curse cast by the malignant gaze of an enemy's
1141340	1145660	envious person now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious but i actually think the
1145660	1152140	concept of the evil eye reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy and of the social danger that it
1152140	1157580	poses you've probably seen these amulets around there's an emoji for them now which are supposed
1157580	1163180	to protect against the evil eye it's called a nazar which comes from the arabic word for sight
1163180	1167900	or surveillance similar to the origin of the english word envy which is the latin invidia
1167900	1171260	which just means to look at so there's an agreement across the
1171340	1177260	cultures that envy is related to sight the malevolent gaze the evil eye and these amulets
1177260	1182540	show that a lot of people are afraid of being envied and want to protect themselves i was just
1182540	1187420	watching this turkish youtube channel with an episode on the evil eye and the host explains
1187420	1194860	that for muslims it's customary to say or god has willed it when admiring a person or object
1194860	1200060	you know to avoid unintentionally cursing them i love that it's like no envy like no homo but no
1201340	1207660	love the top comment on that video says you want to protect yourself from the evil green eye monster
1207660	1213260	well don't tell others about your ideas goals or wishes don't be flaunting your accomplishments on
1213260	1219660	social media or posting pictures of your children that's how you avoid being jinxed see this is where
1219660	1225580	kim kardashian went wrong with her birthday post clearly no one in the kardashian cinematic universe
1225580	1229660	has ever heard of the evil eye wait i thought these people were armenians why haven't they heard
1229660	1230460	a thief oh
1231500	1237820	okay never mind every piece of media they've ever produced is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle
1237820	1244700	this is a particularly american thing most americans have no concept of the fear of envy
1244700	1249500	like there's advertisements here that literally promise if you buy this exclusive
1249500	1255980	luxury vibrator you'll be the envy of all your friends as if it's a good thing to be envied oh
1255980	1261260	but it is not if people envy you they gossip about you right they seethe over your success
1261340	1267500	and celebrate your misfortunes being envied is basically the opposite of being loved so why would
1267500	1272700	anyone want to be envied well it's a contradiction of human nature on the one hand we need to be
1272700	1280220	loved but then there's this other drive in us this like homeric striving for fame and glory and
1280220	1286140	riches which is kind of in conflict with our need to be loved in a past gilded age there were stories
1286140	1289500	like citizen kane and sunset boulevard which warned what a sad and lonely life would be like in the
1289500	1291340	past gilded age there were stories like citizen kane and sunset boulevard which warned what a sad and
1291340	1295380	lonely thing success can become.
1295380	1301140	In ancient democratic Athens, there was a practice called ostracismos, which is the
1301140	1304340	origin of the English word ostracism.
1304340	1308460	Ostracism was a procedure where the Athenians would assemble, and each person would write
1308460	1314140	the name of a person they wanted to ostracize on a pottery shard called an ostracon.
1314140	1318740	And whoever got the most votes would simply be banished from the city for ten years, no
1318740	1319740	questions asked.
1319740	1324660	I love the ancient world, things were so direct.
1324660	1329780	Often this was used to remove someone who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant
1329780	1330980	or just annoying.
1330980	1334880	According to Plutarch, I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia, in one anecdote
1334880	1341920	about Aristides, known as Aristides the Just, who was ostracized in 482, an illiterate citizen
1341920	1346940	not recognizing him came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostracon.
1346940	1349300	When Aristides asked why, the man replied,
1349300	1352540	It was because he was sick of hearing him being called the Just.
1352540	1353540	It's good!
1353540	1354540	It's so good!
1354540	1359180	See, this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.
1359180	1361980	This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.
1361980	1367200	People in most cultures, not all, but most cultures understand that being envied is a
1367200	1371980	massive social liability, so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.
1371980	1376460	According to a Tamil saying, the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.
1376460	1378580	This is sometimes called Tall Poppy Syndrome.
1378580	1379300	Tall Poppy Syndrome.
1379300	1381940	Tallest poppies in the garden will be cut.
1381940	1387800	Shook argues that the fear of envy is a major inhibiting force in many societies.
1387800	1392820	In Haiti, G.E. Simpson found that a peasant will seek to disguise his true economic position
1392820	1396920	by purchasing several smaller fields rather than one larger piece of land.
1396920	1399420	For the same reason, he will not wear good clothes.
1399420	1404300	He does this intentionally to protect himself against the envious black magic of his neighbors.
1404300	1408300	Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America, like I've known people from seriously
1408300	1409300	wealthy families.
1409300	1415220	They dress like gutter punks, like they're trying to pass as poor.
1415220	1420940	But in general, Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy, in the way many other cultures
1420940	1421940	do.
1421940	1422940	And I don't think that's an accident.
1422940	1427360	We're a nation of show-offs, and so the taboo against discussing envy is related to
1427360	1430540	our whole national ethos of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.
1430540	1434820	But though the fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely
1434820	1436860	still there, only repressed.
1436860	1437940	Confined to the realm of dreams and art.
1437940	1438940	The fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely still
1438940	1440580	there, only repressed.
1440580	1448500	In the movie Black Swan, Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina who achieves her dream of getting
1448500	1453920	the lead role in Swan Lake, after which her life and mind are totally unraveled by fear
1453920	1455180	of envy.
1455180	1457220	Black magic, black swan.
1457220	1462420	At first we see how Nina's success comes at the very real cost of being envied.
1462420	1467900	By her ex-ballerina mother, by the other girls in the company, and by the former lead ballerina
1467900	1468900	she's replaced.
1468940	1469940	Did you suck his c**k?
1469940	1470940	Not all of us have to.
1470940	1471940	I love Winona Ryder so much.
1471940	1472940	I love Natalie Portman so much.
1472940	1473940	I love Mila Kunis so much.
1473940	1474940	I just like women.
1474940	1475940	Where's my shock wand?
1475940	1476940	Stop it.
1476940	1477940	Stop stanning.
1477940	1478940	But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia, as Nina begins hallucinating black swan doppelgangers
1478940	1479940	and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis, who's trying to steal her role.
1479940	1480940	You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.
1480940	1481940	They'll getcha.
1481940	1482940	Did you hear that?
1482940	1483940	I don't.
1483940	1484940	I don't.
1484940	1485940	I don't.
1485940	1486940	I don't.
1486940	1487940	I don't.
1487940	1488940	I don't.
1488940	1489940	I don't.
1489940	1490940	I don't.
1490940	1491940	I don't.
1491940	1492940	I don't.
1492940	1493940	I don't.
1493940	1494940	I don't.
1494940	1495940	I don't.
1495940	1496940	I don't.
1496940	1497940	I don't.
1497940	1498940	I don't.
1498940	1499940	I don't.
1499940	1500940	I don't.
1500940	1501940	I don't.
1501940	1502940	Stop.
1502940	1507140	You could argue that Nina is actually suffering a kind of self-envy, where she envies the
1507140	1513560	disinhibited, sexually liberated, corrupted part of herself that's capable of adult eroticism
1513560	1516160	and also of dancing the black swan.
1516160	1521020	So she imagines that part of herself as an envious rival who's trying to replace her.
1521020	1524900	It's like her mind is split between two impulses.
1524900	1530780	There's her dominant White Swan Impulse, which we could call the Squidward personality, perfectionistic
1530780	1535240	and orderly, but reserved, priggish, stiff.
1535240	1540520	And then there's her repressed Black Swan Impulse, which we could call the SpongeBob
1540520	1545180	personality, intuitive, chaotic, ecstatic.
1545180	1551300	In SpongeBob SquarePants, the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy, stemming
1551300	1552300	from failed ambition.
1552300	1556480	Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.
1556480	1561640	Squidward aspires to artistic achievement, but remains a mediocrity, partly because of
1561640	1565760	his overly dry, doctrinaire attitude towards art.
1565760	1570180	SpongeBob is Squidward's social equal, they're literally neighbors, and they both work the
1570180	1574580	same fast food service job for the same exploitative capitalist.
1574580	1580020	But SpongeBob is a Mozartian intuitive genius, who's able to transform the most mundane
1580020	1582280	activities, glowing bubbles, flippin' bubbles, into the world of art.
1582280	1586060	From flipping burgers, into a kind of aesthetic rapture.
1586060	1591840	Squidward intensely envies SpongeBob's uninhibited joy and intuitive creativity, but he can't
1591840	1594500	admit that envy to himself.
1594500	1600240	So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling is contempt, snobbish disdain for
1600240	1602660	SpongeBob's childish behavior.
1602660	1607220	What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.
1607220	1610520	Though deep down, Squidward really wants what SpongeBob has.
1610520	1611520	It's beautiful!
1611520	1612060	It's beautiful!
1612280	1614800	Uh, I mean, uh.
1614800	1618320	Which we see when he can't help himself from blowing bubbles, or when he trades away
1618320	1622480	all of his possessions for the chewing gum wrapper that in SpongeBob's hands was a
1622480	1624520	source of infinite entertainment.
1624520	1629380	A lot of people my age who watched SpongeBob as a kid rewatch it now, and are horrified
1629380	1634600	to discover that they identify with Squidward, whereas as children, they identified with
1634600	1635600	SpongeBob.
1635600	1638660	Well, you either die as SpongeBob, or you live long enough to see yourself become the
1638660	1639660	Squidward.
1639660	1640660	Future!
1640660	1641520	And there's a lot more to it.
1641520	1646840	And there's a pain in becoming Squidward, which is usually explained as the disappointing
1646840	1650400	drudgery of adult life, or simply loss of childhood.
1650400	1655840	I would argue that envy of childhood is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.
1655840	1656840	Squidwardian?
1656840	1657840	Are we saying that word?
1657840	1660260	Are we really saying that word out loud?
1660260	1661920	To an audience of millions?
1661920	1662920	Okay!
1662920	1668520	It's basically the same dynamic as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.
1668520	1669520	Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart!
1669520	1670520	Oh my god!
1670520	1671520	Oh my god!
1671520	1672520	It's the evil eye!
1672520	1673520	You gotta watch out for that one, kids!
1673520	1677680	If a mysterious stranger shows up on your doorstep at midnight asking you to compose
1677680	1681420	a requiem math for your own father, just say no!
1681420	1687540	So in SpongeMadeus Mozart pants, we have a diligent-tho-stuffy wannabe envying the effortless
1687540	1690220	playfulness of the spontaneous genius.
1690220	1691220	Ah!
1691220	1692220	Ah!
1692220	1693220	Ah!
1693220	1694220	Ah!
1694220	1695220	Ah!
1695220	1696220	Ah!
1696220	1697220	Ah!
1697220	1698220	Ah!
1698220	1699220	Ah!
1699220	1700220	Ah!
1700220	1708000	So Squidward's envy of SpongeBob is, well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.
1708200	1712380	Look, if we were to view SpongeBob SquarePants through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche,
1712520	1714300	stay with me ladies, I have an angle here,
1714420	1718480	we could say that Squidward represents what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse,
1718480	1721320	while SpongeBob represents the Dionysian.
1721640	1726300	Nietzsche thought there were two conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.
1726300	1730840	The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo, is the drive towards self-control,
1731260	1733360	order, logic, morality.
1733880	1739900	And the Dionysian, named after Dionysus, is the drive toward intoxication, frenzy, passion,
1740120	1740600	intuition.
1741080	1745520	Both SpongeBob and Amadeus present these two drives in conflict,
1745520	1749020	with the Apollonian envying the Dionysian.
1749440	1753260	Of course, this is a misrepresentation of how art is actually created,
1753620	1756280	because Nietzsche's whole point is that you need a balance
1756280	1757400	of the two drives.
1757640	1761780	In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist like SpongeBob,
1762120	1766740	because creating good art requires at least some level of discipline in ordering.
1767100	1769120	See? It is all in the technique.
1769340	1771480	Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.
1771900	1773120	Get off the stage!
1773240	1776520	So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.
1777000	1778920	In order to give the perfect performance,
1779380	1783740	Mina has to unify her fragmented personality and dance both swans,
1783920	1786220	resolving the envious rivalry between her
1786220	1788220	and the two artistic impulses.
1788800	1789800	It was perfect.
1795440	1799920	Another movie about fear of envious ballerina doppelgangers
1800840	1801840	Can you guess it?
1801840	1805040	is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us,
1805300	1810800	which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and fear of the American middle class.
1811040	1815580	We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family with a vacation house
1815580	1820680	and a boat, along with the Tylers, a slightly better-off white family,
1821100	1822460	whom the Wilsons envy.
1822800	1824280	You saw their new car, right?
1824540	1825240	You had to do it.
1825260	1827660	You just had to get that thing to fuck with me, too.
1827660	1833360	One night, the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.
1833900	1836320	Red, the only doppelganger who can speak,
1836720	1840540	explains that her family is metaphysically tethered to the Wilsons,
1841040	1843780	living wretched and destitute versions of their lives
1843780	1845560	in a liminal backroom's office.
1845580	1846220	Underworld.
1846220	1847580	It's super-fucking-liminal.
1847580	1849580	I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting.
1849580	1850480	Not again.
1850480	1855380	Once upon a time, there was a girl, and the girl had a shadow.
1855760	1858760	The two were connected, tethered together.
1859500	1864100	When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty.
1864540	1870500	But when the shadow was hungry, she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.
1871020	1873400	We later find out that all over the US,
1873400	1875400	oh, US spells us,
1875580	1877580	hey, that's the title of the movie.
1877580	1879580	Ohhhh.
1879580	1883580	The tethered have risen up to kill their privileged doppelgangers
1883580	1885580	and to link arms across the country
1885580	1889580	in a dark parody of the real-world 1986 homelessness fundraiser
1889580	1891580	Hands Across America.
1891580	1897580	So my reading of Us is that it's an expression of middle-class guilt about privilege
1897580	1899580	and fear of envy.
1899580	1901580	It's not a movie about the working class.
1901580	1903580	If it was a movie about the working class,
1903580	1905580	then the working class would be able to speak humanly.
1905580	1909580	And would not be scary monsters who make animal sounds
1909580	1911580	and stagger around like zombies.
1911580	1917580	This is a movie about the anxious middle class's nightmare of the working class.
1917580	1923580	Us represents in a self-aware way what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.
1923580	1925580	The fear of the envious poor.
1925580	1927580	Of revolution.
1927580	1929580	Of slave revolt.
1929580	1931580	Tell me you did not just reference Home Alone.
1931580	1933580	But Us diverges from other home invasion movies
1933580	1935580	by not just being fearful about the underclass,
1935580	1937580	but also guilty.
1937580	1939580	The idea of the tethered underclass
1939580	1941580	represents life as a zero-sum game
1941580	1943580	where every moment of your happiness
1943580	1945580	is bought with someone else's suffering.
1945580	1947580	It's an incredibly guilty fantasy.
1947580	1949580	An internalization of the black magic logic
1949580	1951580	of people who blame their own misfortunes
1951580	1953580	on the people they envy.
1953580	1955580	As Shook puts it,
1955580	1957580	my neighbor's harvest
1957580	1959580	can only have turned out better than mine.
1959580	1961580	And it's not just me.
1961580	1963580	My neighbor's harvest
1963580	1965580	can only have turned out better than mine.
1965580	1967580	Because he has somehow succeeded in reducing mine by black magic.
1967580	1969580	So the fear of envy
1969580	1971580	and the guilt of success
1971580	1973580	are repressed in American culture.
1973580	1975580	But they still find expression in movies.
1975580	1977580	Jordan Peele is kind of like the Charles Dickens
1977580	1979580	of the 21st century.
1979580	1981580	Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol.
1981580	1983580	A story about the guilt of the rich
1983580	1985580	if ever there was one.
1985580	1987580	You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts
1987580	1989580	who show him how wretched and sad
1989580	1991580	the lives of his employees are
1991580	1993580	and how he'll die alone
1993580	1995580	and hated by everyone
1995580	1997580	and his funeral is only attended by businessmen
1997580	1999580	on the condition that lunch is provided.
1999580	2001580	Dickens was truly the master
2001580	2003580	of scaring the rich straight.
2003580	2005580	So maybe fear of envy
2005580	2007580	can serve a softly regulatory function
2007580	2009580	by motivating charity
2009580	2011580	and generosity in the rich.
2011580	2013580	But in general, I'm suspicious of envy
2013580	2015580	as a motivation for politics.
2015580	2017580	Because remember,
2017580	2019580	the basic logic of envy is
2019580	2021580	if I can't have it,
2021580	2023580	I can't.
2023580	2025580	Which is a purely negative, destructive
2025580	2027580	style of thinking.
2027580	2029580	It's taking privileges away
2029580	2031580	not for the material benefit of the underprivileged
2031580	2033580	but merely for the psychological satisfaction
2033580	2035580	of the envious person.
2035580	2037580	And that's even worse
2037580	2039580	when you consider that envy is subjective.
2039580	2041580	It doesn't necessarily target
2041580	2043580	objective power and privilege.
2043580	2045580	So envy in politics
2045580	2047580	is not by any means
2047580	2049580	relegated to the left.
2049580	2051580	Conservative politics is brimming with envy.
2051580	2053580	In the debate about forgiving student loan debt,
2053580	2055580	you often hear people say
2055580	2057580	I had to pay my student loans
2057580	2059580	so they should too.
2059580	2061580	Debt forgiveness is not fear.
2061580	2063580	The logic here is
2063580	2065580	since I didn't get my student debt forgiven,
2065580	2067580	no one should.
2067580	2069580	It's intergenerational envy.
2069580	2071580	Which is a pretty common thing.
2071580	2073580	Usually older generations
2073580	2075580	envying the young.
2075580	2077580	Kids these days have it so easy.
2077580	2079580	When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast
2079580	2081580	and sent text messages
2081580	2083580	to the phone.
2083580	2085580	The feeling is basically
2085580	2087580	it's not fair that kids these days
2087580	2089580	don't have to suffer like I suffered.
2089580	2091580	Or think about the concept
2091580	2093580	of a welfare queen
2093580	2095580	which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.
2095580	2097580	Or the way conservatives talk about immigration.
2097580	2099580	It's all this envious suspicion
2099580	2101580	about illegal immigrants
2101580	2103580	sneaking in
2103580	2105580	and getting government handouts
2105580	2107580	without having to pay taxes.
2107580	2109580	I had to work hard for my money
2109580	2111580	so why should these people get a free ride?
2111580	2113580	What is an illegal immigrant
2113580	2115580	is actually like,
2115580	2117580	except in the imagination
2117580	2119580	of people who envy them.
2119580	2121580	Envy is felt more intensely
2121580	2123580	by prideful people.
2123580	2125580	So it's especially sharp
2125580	2127580	when it targets people
2127580	2129580	who are supposed to be beneath you.
2129580	2131580	The Jewish radical feminist
2131580	2133580	Andrea Dworkin
2133580	2135580	made what I think
2135580	2137580	is a pretty compelling argument
2137580	2139580	that both antisemitism
2139580	2141580	and misogyny
2141580	2143580	are the main protagonists
2143580	2145580	of Tolstoy's story
2145580	2147580	The Kreutzer Sonata
2147580	2149580	who resents that women and Jews
2149580	2151580	find a kind of paradoxical power
2151580	2153580	in their own oppression.
2153580	2155580	Just like the Jews
2155580	2157580	as they pay us back for their oppression
2157580	2159580	by financial domination
2159580	2161580	so it is with women.
2161580	2163580	Ah, you want us to be traitors only?
2163580	2165580	Alright.
2165580	2167580	As traitors we will dominate you,
2167580	2169580	say the Jews.
2169580	2171580	Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?
2171580	2173580	This dominance of men by women
2173580	2175580	is experienced by the men
2175580	2177580	as real. Emotionally real.
2177580	2179580	Sexually real. Psychologically real.
2179580	2181580	It emerges as the reason
2181580	2183580	for the wrath of the misogynist.
2183580	2185580	The woman appears to control sex.
2185580	2187580	The man needs it.
2187580	2189580	This causes his rage
2189580	2191580	at her perceived power over him.
2191580	2193580	Women control access
2193580	2195580	to what men want
2195580	2197580	which gives women a kind of indirect power
2197580	2199580	that some men envy.
2199580	2201580	They envy the sexual power
2201580	2203580	of women.
2203580	2205580	It doesn't matter to the misogynist
2205580	2207580	that, especially at the time
2207580	2209580	Tolstoy was writing,
2209580	2211580	women objectively have less power
2211580	2213580	in society than men.
2213580	2215580	He envies women because they have
2215580	2217580	what he desires.
2217580	2219580	Likewise, it didn't matter
2219580	2221580	to Weimar anti-Semites
2221580	2223580	that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.
2223580	2225580	Anti-Semitism is often rooted
2225580	2227580	in an envious obsession
2227580	2229580	with the disproportionate influence
2229580	2231580	and affluence of Jewish people.
2231580	2233580	There are no differences between men
2233580	2235580	which feed envy,
2235580	2237580	but subjective perception,
2237580	2239580	the optics of envy.
2241580	2243580	Magic mirror
2243580	2245580	on the wall,
2245580	2247580	who's the cuntest of them all?
2249580	2251580	Thou art
2251580	2253580	cunt, my queen.
2253580	2255580	But hold,
2255580	2257580	a lovely maid
2257580	2259580	I see.
2259580	2261580	Oh yes,
2261580	2263580	I see.
2263580	2265580	What?
2265580	2267580	In a way,
2267580	2269580	I'm kind of just in the beginning
2269580	2271580	of this whole transition,
2271580	2273580	you know, like a young little girl
2273580	2275580	going through all these things,
2275580	2277580	having a sleepover with the girls.
2277580	2279580	What do we do on a sleepover?
2279580	2281580	Do we have like pillow fights
2281580	2283580	and all that stuff?
2283580	2285580	Alas,
2285580	2287580	she is more cunt than thee.
2287580	2289580	My pussy's stunting on the gram
2289580	2291580	The classic 1937 Disney movie
2291580	2293580	Snow White and the Wicked Milf
2293580	2295580	is the story of a quote
2295580	2297580	vain and wicked queen
2297580	2299580	who obsessively envies the beauty
2299580	2301580	of her own stepdaughter.
2301580	2303580	Are you sure this one's for children?
2303580	2305580	Every day the milf queen asks the mirror
2305580	2307580	who's the fairest one of all
2307580	2309580	and the mirror responds that the queen is the fairest
2309580	2311580	till one day it says the stepdaughter
2311580	2313580	Snow White is the fairest
2313580	2315580	which sends the queen into an envious fury
2315580	2317580	resulting in a series of bizarre murder attempts.
2317580	2319580	So first of all,
2319580	2321580	why don't we talk plot holes, ding?
2321580	2323580	Are we really supposed to believe
2323580	2325580	that this is more beautiful
2325580	2327580	than this?
2327580	2329580	Uh, ding!
2329580	2331580	Isn't Snow White like 12 years old?
2331580	2333580	What's going on, Walt?
2333580	2335580	Why don't you take a seat?
2335580	2337580	Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.
2337580	2339580	It's hard to tell because she's constantly
2339580	2341580	surrounded by manlets.
2341580	2343580	But she's just so boring.
2343580	2345580	And the queen is such a baddie.
2345580	2347580	Step on my throat, mother.
2347580	2349580	This is a horny video.
2349580	2351580	I can feel the pulse back in my veins.
2351580	2353580	So despite the injustice done
2353580	2355580	to its lead milf,
2355580	2357580	Snow White does illustrate some interesting things
2357580	2359580	about envy.
2359580	2361580	Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft
2361580	2363580	as an expression of envy.
2363580	2365580	We have the age difference,
2365580	2367580	intergenerational envy,
2367580	2369580	the envy of youth.
2369580	2371580	It kind of reminds me of those millennial women
2371580	2373580	who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need
2373580	2375580	to rage against Gen Z.
2375580	2377580	Pretty counterproductive since
2377580	2379580	if you're worried about seeming old,
2379580	2381580	it's probably not helping your case gorge.
2381580	2383580	You might wonder if there's also jealousy
2383580	2385580	involved with the evil queen.
2385580	2387580	Like, is she worried that the king is gonna fall in love
2387580	2389580	with his own daughter?
2389580	2391580	Well, I don't think so.
2391580	2393580	Because we never even see the king.
2393580	2395580	The queen doesn't mention him.
2395580	2397580	It's not about the king.
2397580	2399580	So there's no romantic jealousy involved.
2399580	2401580	It's just one woman envying another woman
2401580	2403580	over beauty for its own sake.
2403580	2405580	We stan a Bechdel test passing
2405580	2407580	movie about women hating each other.
2407580	2409580	Gatekeep? Gas Girl?
2409580	2411580	Gas Keep? Light Boss?
2411580	2413580	In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version,
2413580	2415580	the queen first tries killing Snow White
2415580	2417580	with beauty accessories,
2417580	2419580	poisoning a comb and lacing her to death
2419580	2421580	with a corset.
2421580	2423580	I wish I could die that way.
2423580	2425580	What's really striking is the pure
2425580	2427580	kamikaze malignity of it all.
2427580	2429580	This queen, who we know
2429580	2431580	is obsessed with her look,
2431580	2433580	is willing to transform herself with witchcraft
2433580	2435580	into an ugly old hag
2435580	2437580	just to give Snow White
2437580	2439580	the poisoned apple.
2439580	2441580	Disguising herself as an old hag
2441580	2443580	parallels Satan disguising himself as a serpent.
2443580	2445580	I mean, you could actually argue
2445580	2447580	that the queen is simply a persona of Satan.
2447580	2449580	It's paradise lost all over again.
2449580	2451580	Which also happens to be
2451580	2453580	the title of my memoir.
2453580	2455580	The queen is incredibly petty,
2455580	2457580	because even according to the, again,
2457580	2459580	wrong and tasteless mirror,
2459580	2461580	she's still the second most beautiful woman
2461580	2463580	in the world.
2463580	2465580	How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy
2465580	2467580	still be consumed by envy?
2467580	2469580	Well,
2469580	2471580	basically, because that's how envy works.
2471580	2473580	It's petty,
2473580	2475580	it's subjective,
2475580	2477580	and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality
2477580	2479580	or to the absolute
2479580	2481580	position on the overall hierarchy.
2481580	2483580	So you can be the second best in the world
2483580	2485580	and still be
2485580	2487580	obsessively envious of the one
2487580	2489580	person who may barely even be above you.
2489580	2491580	In fact, there's studies showing
2491580	2493580	that Olympic silver medalists
2493580	2495580	are actually less satisfied with their prize
2495580	2497580	than bronze medalists.
2497580	2499580	Probably because the bronze medalist is just happy
2499580	2501580	to be on the podium at all,
2501580	2503580	while the silver medalist is so close to first,
2503580	2505580	they can't help but wonder
2505580	2507580	what if?
2507580	2509580	Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth
2509580	2511580	not by comparing ourselves to any absolute
2511580	2513580	standard, but by comparing ourselves
2513580	2515580	to each other. And we're more likely
2515580	2517580	to compare ourselves to the people who are around
2517580	2519580	us than we are to people who are far away.
2519580	2521580	We could call this
2521580	2523580	the proximity effect of envy.
2523580	2525580	We're more likely to envy people who are
2525580	2527580	close to us, or similar to us.
2527580	2529580	Especially people we're in competition with.
2529580	2531580	That's why social media
2531580	2533580	is such a nightmare. It's an incubator
2533580	2535580	of envy, because it puts everyone
2535580	2537580	next to everyone else.
2537580	2539580	So we're all being compared, all in competition.
2539580	2541580	And it can destroy your
2541580	2543580	self-esteem, because you're comparing
2543580	2545580	your actual life
2545580	2547580	to these idealized images.
2547580	2549580	And it also turns public figures into
2549580	2551580	lightning rods for envy,
2551580	2553580	because of the numeric visibility
2553580	2555580	of popularity and success.
2555580	2557580	It's a perverse consequence
2557580	2559580	of the proximity effect that
2559580	2561580	envy within an oppressed class
2561580	2563580	is often more venomous and obsessive
2563580	2565580	than envy for the oppressor.
2565580	2567580	So for example, in Snow White
2567580	2569580	and Black Swan,
2569580	2571580	you have women envying other women.
2571580	2573580	Because women are often in
2573580	2575580	competition with each other.
2575580	2577580	And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.
2577580	2579580	In media, there's constant portrayals of
2579580	2581580	vain and envious women.
2581580	2583580	Jealous bitches fighting
2583580	2585580	over men, over youth,
2585580	2587580	over beauty.
2587580	2589580	It's like drag queen femininity.
2589580	2591580	It becomes her femininity.
2591580	2593580	On guard!
2593580	2595580	Bitch!
2595580	2597580	So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope.
2597580	2599580	But...
2599580	2601580	How do I put this delicately?
2601580	2603580	Sometimes reality is misogynistic.
2603580	2605580	Like when my eyelash won't stay glued on.
2605580	2607580	The patriarchy's machinations
2607580	2609580	are clearly to blame.
2609580	2611580	In her 1976 essay, Trashing
2611580	2613580	The Dark Side of Sisterhood,
2613580	2615580	feminist Jo Freeman wrote about her ostracism
2615580	2617580	from within the women's movement.
2617580	2619580	I've been watching for years
2619580	2621580	and I'm starting to say as the movement
2621580	2623580	consciously destroys anyone within it
2623580	2625580	who stands out in any way.
2625580	2627580	And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist
2627580	2629580	Anselma del Olio.
2629580	2631580	And who do they attack?
2631580	2633580	Achievement or accomplishment of any kind
2633580	2635580	would seem to be the worst crime.
2635580	2637580	Do anything that every other woman
2637580	2639580	secretly or otherwise feels she could do
2639580	2641580	just as well, and you're in for it.
2641580	2643580	You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking
2643580	2645580	opportunist, a ruthless mercenary
2645580	2647580	out to make her fame and fortune
2647580	2649580	in the bodies of selfless sisters
2649580	2651580	who have buried their abilities
2651580	2653580	and sacrificed their ambitions
2653580	2655580	for the greater glory of feminism.
2655580	2657580	Freeman speculates.
2657580	2659580	The primary reason there have been
2659580	2661580	so few great women blank
2661580	2663580	is not merely that greatness
2663580	2665580	has been undeveloped
2665580	2667580	or unrecognized, but that women
2667580	2669580	exhibiting potential for achievement
2669580	2671580	are punished by both women and men.
2671580	2673580	The fear of success
2673580	2675580	is quite rational when one knows
2675580	2677580	that the consequence of achievement
2677580	2679580	is hostility and not praise.
2679580	2681580	So at no point in this essay
2681580	2683580	does Jo Freeman use the word envy.
2683580	2685580	But as usual, envy is right
2685580	2687580	below the surface, causing
2687580	2689580	all the trouble.
2689580	2691580	So Freeman is describing
2691580	2693580	how people from marginalized groups
2693580	2695580	whose ambition raises them above
2695580	2697580	the typical limits set by marginalization
2697580	2699580	are often ostracized
2699580	2701580	from their own communities.
2701580	2703580	But she has no causal explanation
2703580	2705580	for why this happens.
2705580	2707580	I have an explanation. The explanation is envy.
2707580	2709580	Women are more likely to envy other women.
2709580	2711580	Trans women are more likely
2711580	2713580	to envy other trans women.
2713580	2715580	Oh god, am I really gonna go there?
2715580	2717580	If we did this topic justice,
2717580	2719580	this video would be nine centuries long.
2719580	2721580	Angar!
2721580	2723580	Bitch!
2723580	2725580	A lot of people assume that trans women
2725580	2727580	envy cis women. And there is some truth to that.
2727580	2729580	There definitely was a time in my life
2729580	2731580	when I used to envy cis women
2731580	2733580	for being cis women.
2733580	2735580	But now I kind of just don't even allow myself
2735580	2737580	to have the thought,
2737580	2739580	to be a cis woman.
2739580	2741580	So in a way, because becoming a cis woman
2741580	2743580	is impossible, it's unobtainable,
2743580	2745580	I actually envy cis women less.
2745580	2747580	So trans women are more likely
2747580	2749580	to envy other trans women.
2749580	2751580	Because of the proximity effect
2751580	2753580	and because another trans woman
2753580	2755580	represents an actual possibility
2755580	2757580	of what I, a trans woman,
2757580	2759580	could become.
2759580	2761580	She's a standard to which I could
2761580	2763580	plausibly compare myself.
2763580	2765580	Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.
2765580	2767580	Am I the only one who finds it hard
2767580	2769580	to watch trans creators?
2769580	2771580	Before I realized I was a trans woman,
2771580	2773580	I fucking loved people like ContraPoints,
2773580	2775580	Nick Spears, and other trans creators.
2775580	2777580	But ever since I realized I was trans,
2777580	2779580	I just get this angry, resentful feeling
2779580	2781580	in the pit of my stomach whenever I get recommended
2781580	2783580	any of these videos.
2783580	2785580	I seriously loved ContraPoints,
2785580	2787580	but whenever I try to watch any of her videos,
2787580	2789580	I just want to scream.
2789580	2791580	I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.
2791580	2793580	I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.
2793580	2795580	Am I just a toxic person?
2795580	2797580	Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person.
2797580	2799580	At least not any worse than anyone else.
2799580	2801580	It's just that human nature
2801580	2803580	is a toxic person.
2803580	2805580	And that angry, resentful feeling
2805580	2807580	in the pit of your stomach
2807580	2809580	that makes you want to scream
2809580	2811580	and feel such a hatred has a name.
2811580	2813580	And the name is Envy.
2813580	2815580	I actually admire the person who wrote this post
2815580	2817580	because they're doing the best that any of us
2817580	2819580	can do, really,
2819580	2821580	which is noticing the feeling
2821580	2823580	without endorsing the feeling.
2823580	2825580	I wish that more people could feel things
2825580	2827580	without rushing to a rational,
2827580	2829580	even if they don't want to.
2829580	2831580	It isn't rationality itself,
2831580	2833580	often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious.
2833580	2835580	Sometimes people have no self-awareness
2835580	2837580	about it at all.
2837580	2839580	For example, there's a certain kind of
2839580	2841580	boomer transsexual who complains that
2841580	2843580	when I transitioned,
2843580	2845580	I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping,
2845580	2847580	but kids these days just waltz on in
2847580	2849580	and walk out with hormones.
2849580	2851580	It's intergenerational envy,
2851580	2853580	trans addition.
2853580	2855580	It was hard for me, so it should be hard for everyone.
2855580	2857580	Like the student debt-dippy.
2857580	2859580	If I can't have it, no one can.
2859580	2861580	And look, I do have sympathy
2861580	2863580	and admiration for older trans people.
2863580	2865580	Like, being trans in 2021
2865580	2867580	is already the maximum
2867580	2869580	level of adversity that I can handle.
2869580	2871580	I cannot imagine how hard
2871580	2873580	it was to do this in the 80s.
2873580	2875580	However, the pain of envy
2875580	2877580	is not a valid argument.
2877580	2879580	Envy is not sacred rage.
2879580	2881580	And the malignant demands of envious people
2881580	2883580	should be ignored.
2883580	2885580	God, this community.
2885580	2887580	The constant competition.
2887580	2889580	The cringing.
2889580	2891580	It makes it really hard to get along with other trans people.
2891580	2893580	Oh, speaking of which.
2893580	2895580	Gay tangent, everybody. Gay tangent.
2895580	2897580	Envy presents kind of a unique
2897580	2899580	problem to same-sex attracted people.
2899580	2901580	Because of the increased risk
2901580	2903580	of envying the very people
2903580	2905580	you're attracted to.
2905580	2907580	I wanna the ones I envy.
2907580	2909580	You know, it's the classic
2909580	2911580	do I want you or do I want to be you
2911580	2913580	problem. I've heard feminine queer
2913580	2915580	women say they could never date another
2915580	2917580	femme because they're worried
2917580	2919580	they would just end up envying her.
2919580	2921580	So dating masculine women solves that
2921580	2923580	problem. Because having separate roles,
2923580	2925580	separate aesthetics, separate
2925580	2927580	categories helps to avert
2927580	2929580	proximity envy between
2929580	2931580	partners. Unfortunately,
2931580	2933580	I am not that smart.
2933580	2935580	Basically, I am attracted
2935580	2937580	to femininity. But I also want to
2937580	2939580	embody a kind of feminine archetype
2939580	2941580	myself. I'm not masculine
2941580	2943580	and I don't wanna be. You know, I used to think
2943580	2945580	I'd only wanna date another trans woman
2945580	2947580	because of the mutual understanding
2947580	2949580	but I've kind of realized that at this point
2949580	2951580	it may actually be more psychologically healthy
2951580	2953580	for me to open up to dating cis women.
2953580	2955580	I used to not wanna do that because I was
2955580	2957580	afraid it would make me feel like a man. But at this point
2957580	2959580	honestly, just
2959580	2961580	be a man. Whatever.
2961580	2963580	It's fine.
2963580	2965580	As a drag queen once said,
2965580	2967580	I'm more of a man than you'll ever be. I'm more of a woman
2967580	2969580	than you'll ever have. Yes, glad.
2969580	2971580	Can we get the tequila out of the frame please?
2971580	2973580	I think at a distance
2973580	2975580	it's okay to indulge the attraction
2975580	2977580	emulation ambiguity. But if
2977580	2979580	you wanna actually have a relationship with someone,
2979580	2981580	you have to make up your mind
2981580	2983580	that you desire this woman
2983580	2985580	and you do not wanna be her.
2985580	2987580	Because think about it from the other perspective.
2987580	2989580	What could be less attractive
2989580	2991580	than someone who literally wants
2991580	2993580	to be you? Teacher,
2993580	2995580	make her stop copying
2995580	2997580	me. Like as much as I joke every
2997580	2999580	episode about how Buffalo Bill
2999580	3001580	is an iconic trans legend,
3001580	3003580	you don't wanna date that bitch.
3003580	3005580	Imagine trying to date Eve
3005580	3007580	from All About Eve. Pass.
3007580	3009580	Hard pass.
3009580	3011580	So if you're a queer woman, or a queer anything honestly,
3011580	3013580	and you find yourself envying your
3013580	3015580	partner, my advice is
3015580	3017580	stop overthinking a good situation.
3017580	3019580	An enviable woman wanted to be with
3019580	3021580	you. So sit back,
3021580	3023580	relax, and enjoy
3023580	3025580	the clout. I get it though.
3025580	3027580	It's complicated.
3027580	3029580	We're all supposed to proudly affirm what we
3029580	3031580	truly desire, but how do you know
3031580	3033580	what you truly desire? Do I want
3033580	3035580	mommy? Or do I wanna
3035580	3037580	be the mommy?
3037580	3039580	Yes. Just yes.
3039580	3041580	Anyway,
3041580	3043580	let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.
3043580	3045580	The mother half took over completely.
3053580	3055580	Do I look okay? Is my head on
3055580	3057580	straight? So,
3057580	3059580	we keep running into this avoidance
3059580	3061580	of the word envy.
3061580	3063580	And people especially cannot seem
3063580	3065580	to notice when they themselves are
3065580	3067580	feeling envious. Like that person who
3067580	3069580	was puzzled over the angry, resentful
3069580	3071580	feeling in the pit of their stomach without
3071580	3073580	being able to name what they were feeling.
3073580	3075580	There's two reasons why people are usually in
3075580	3077580	denial about their own envy. One is
3077580	3079580	guilt, and the other is shame.
3079580	3081580	Shame. Shame
3081580	3083580	because admitting to yourself that you
3083580	3085580	envy someone implies
3085580	3087580	that you feel inferior to them,
3087580	3089580	which is shameful. It wounds
3089580	3091580	the ego. And guilt
3091580	3093580	because envy is malicious.
3093580	3095580	If you envy someone, you may feel angry
3095580	3097580	and miserable about their success
3097580	3099580	and good fortune, and you may wish
3099580	3101580	to see them ruined or brought down.
3101580	3103580	That's cruel and antisocial.
3103580	3105580	It goes against most ideas
3105580	3107580	of morality, and it's a thought that's
3107580	3109580	usually not socially acceptable
3109580	3111580	to admit. So envy is shameful,
3111580	3113580	guilty,
3113580	3115580	and socially unacceptable. And we
3115580	3117580	deal with that by suppressing it
3117580	3119580	from our awareness. But it is still
3119580	3121580	there, and in order to maintain
3121580	3123580	the denial, we have to convince ourselves
3123580	3125580	that this angry, resentful
3125580	3127580	feeling in the pit of our stomach
3127580	3129580	is actually something else.
3129580	3131580	Think about how in Spongebob,
3131580	3133580	Squidward shows contempt for
3133580	3135580	Spongebob's childishness
3135580	3137580	for blowing bubbles, for having fun at
3137580	3139580	work, when in fact,
3139580	3141580	Squidward envies Spongebob's
3141580	3143580	uninhibited joy and intuitive
3143580	3145580	creativity. But he can't allow
3145580	3147580	himself to have the thought that he
3147580	3149580	envies Spongebob, because that would
3149580	3151580	mean recognizing the intolerably
3151580	3153580	shameful truth that he
3153580	3155580	feels inferior to Spongebob.
3155580	3157580	So what he does instead is
3157580	3159580	convince himself that what he really is
3159580	3161580	is a refined sophisticate
3161580	3163580	scoffing at this childish
3163580	3165580	fool.
3169580	3171580	We could call this envy to
3171580	3173580	contempt sublimation.
3173580	3175580	Sublimation is a psychoanalytic
3175580	3177580	term, which means that you transform
3177580	3179580	an ego-wounding feeling
3179580	3181580	or socially unacceptable longing
3181580	3183580	into something more
3183580	3185580	ego-flattering or socially acceptable.
3185580	3187580	So the classic example used by Freud
3187580	3189580	is the transformation of sexual
3189580	3191580	urges of erotic
3191580	3193580	energy into creative
3193580	3195580	expression. It's like the founder of the
3195580	3197580	NoFap movement, Lady Gaga,
3197580	3199580	once said,
3199580	3201580	I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone,
3201580	3203580	they're gonna take my creativity from me through my
3203580	3205580	So according to Freud,
3205580	3207580	the vast majority of erotic longings
3207580	3209580	can never be fulfilled.
3209580	3211580	Tell me about it, Sigmund. Ugh.
3211580	3213580	Misery.
3213580	3215580	There's a positive side to this, supposedly,
3215580	3217580	which is that you can sublimate your
3217580	3219580	erotic longings into a more
3219580	3221580	socially acceptable productivity.
3221580	3223580	So, you know, instead of slicking the bean,
3223580	3225580	maybe you write novels
3225580	3227580	about thirsty vampires, or
3227580	3229580	for that matter, philosophical treatises
3229580	3231580	about the will to power.
3231580	3233580	Oh, we'll get to you. Freud thought that
3233580	3235580	civilization itself is built at the cost
3235580	3237580	of our instincts, most of which
3237580	3239580	we have to sacrifice in order to
3239580	3241580	live in a society. So like erotic
3241580	3243580	impulses, I think envy can
3243580	3245580	be sublimated, which is what's happening
3245580	3247580	when it becomes contempt.
3247580	3249580	Another example is the blog
3249580	3251580	McMansion Hell, which makes fun of the
3251580	3253580	tasteless architecture of suburban
3253580	3255580	ostentatious trash.
3255580	3257580	I would argue that part of the fun of this blog
3257580	3259580	is the pleasure and relief
3259580	3261580	of looking down
3261580	3263580	at the rich.
3263580	3265580	Because looking enviously up at the rich
3265580	3267580	is painful. It makes you feel
3267580	3269580	inferior. And a way to
3269580	3271580	alleviate that pain is to sublimate
3271580	3273580	envy, and pretend
3273580	3275580	that you're an aristocratic
3275580	3277580	esthete, scoffing at the vulgar
3277580	3279580	taste of the Ereveste.
3279580	3281580	These flying buttresses are an
3281580	3283580	extremely poor taste.
3283580	3285580	Another example is shit-talking
3285580	3287580	plastic surgery. I once heard a
3287580	3289580	trans woman say, at least I don't look
3289580	3291580	like a botched sex doll.
3291580	3293580	The subtext is, there's a certain kind of
3293580	3295580	trans woman influencer who lives in LA
3295580	3297580	and has a lot of cosmetic surgery
3297580	3299580	to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.
3299580	3301580	But it costs a lot of money to look
3301580	3303580	like this. And a lot of trans women can't
3303580	3305580	afford surgeries that they want.
3305580	3307580	And one way to cope with frustrated
3307580	3309580	desire is to convince yourself
3309580	3311580	that the thing that's out of reach
3311580	3313580	is not worth having anyway.
3313580	3315580	See also the discourse on Twitter
3315580	3317580	about how passing is transphobic.
3317580	3319580	There's an ancient Greek fable where
3319580	3321580	a fox wants some grapes, but he can't
3321580	3323580	reach the vine. So he walks away bitterly
3323580	3325580	and says, well the grapes are
3325580	3327580	transphobic anyway. The cisgender
3327580	3329580	version of this is maybe the not like
3329580	3331580	other girls meme. Which is classic
3331580	3333580	envy to contempt sublimation.
3333580	3335580	The trope is usually that other
3335580	3337580	girls are popular and slutty.
3337580	3339580	They have fake tans and fake nails.
3339580	3341580	They like partying and makeup
3341580	3343580	and stupid music for idiots.
3343580	3345580	But I'm quirky and real.
3345580	3347580	I listen to Pink Floyd
3347580	3349580	and read books and eat lots
3349580	3351580	of pizza late at night.
3351580	3353580	Alone and sad.
3353580	3355580	There's usually a subtext of anxiety
3355580	3357580	about inferiority. The other girls
3357580	3359580	being more socially accepted,
3359580	3361580	feminine, and put together.
3361580	3363580	A lot of times the other girls
3363580	3365580	don't even exist, right? They're a media
3365580	3367580	construct of idealized womanhood.
3367580	3369580	Like where are these other girls
3369580	3371580	who've never eaten pizza and enjoy
3371580	3373580	wearing makeup at 9am on a Saturday morning?
3373580	3375580	Are they between the sofa cushions?
3375580	3377580	Did you put them in with the other laundry?
3377580	3379580	Are the other girls in the room with us
3379580	3381580	right now? So the feeling of inferiority
3381580	3383580	toward the other girls is
3383580	3385580	reframed as a kind of contemptuous
3385580	3387580	hipster superiority. Which is
3387580	3389580	really just an ego defensive persona
3389580	3391580	of resentment. Like Janice
3391580	3393580	in Mean Girls. She's not even really a lesbian.
3393580	3395580	She's Lebanese.
3395580	3397580	Regina got confused.
3397580	3399580	And then she dances with a boy at the end.
3399580	3401580	And is readmitted into girlhood.
3401580	3403580	Thank you for that Tina Fey, that's very helpful.
3403580	3405580	Great.
3405580	3407580	Another way we can reframe feelings of
3407580	3409580	envious inferiority is by
3409580	3411580	transforming them into moral
3411580	3413580	superiority. Moral superiority
3413580	3415580	often being the refuge
3415580	3417580	of people with nothing better
3417580	3419580	to feel superior about. We don't have to
3419580	3421580	feel guilty or ashamed of envy
3421580	3423580	if we convince ourselves that we're
3423580	3425580	actually experiencing
3425580	3427580	is justified, legitimate
3427580	3429580	hatred. So for example,
3429580	3431580	think of the morality around sexuality.
3431580	3433580	Part 69
3433580	3435580	Sluts. Yeah, what are you gonna do
3435580	3437580	about it? Cancel me?
3437580	3439580	On guard!
3439580	3441580	Bitch! Why does everyone hate
3441580	3443580	sluts so much? Sluts never did nothing
3443580	3445580	wrong to nobody. Open sexual
3445580	3447580	promiscuity is in a way analogous
3447580	3449580	to opulence. You're conspicuously
3449580	3451580	enjoying something that other
3451580	3453580	people want, but may not be able
3453580	3455580	to get. Many cultures have
3455580	3457580	norms about modesty. For example,
3457580	3459580	expecting women to cover their hair
3459580	3461580	in public. This is usually explained
3461580	3463580	as prophylaxis against male
3463580	3465580	lust, but I wonder if it also
3465580	3467580	serves to prevent a more
3467580	3469580	generalized envy, which female
3469580	3471580	beauty has a way of attracting.
3471580	3473580	Men often slut shame
3473580	3475580	because they want to control female sexuality.
3475580	3477580	And by female sexuality,
3477580	3479580	I do mean male sexuality.
3479580	3481580	Because often what they're really struggling
3481580	3483580	to control is their own
3483580	3485580	desire. But slut shaming is also
3485580	3487580	done pretty viciously by
3487580	3489580	women to each other. And that's a
3489580	3491580	complicated thing. It's more than just
3491580	3493580	envy. Sometimes it comes from a sense that
3493580	3495580	a woman who's having casual sex
3495580	3497580	with a lot of men is compromising
3497580	3499580	the collective sex withholding
3499580	3501580	power of the group. Almost like
3501580	3503580	she's crossing a picket line. But there's
3503580	3505580	also sometimes a resentment
3505580	3507580	that a woman who's showing skin
3507580	3509580	is using her body to get
3509580	3511580	unearned attention.
3511580	3513580	And that smells like envy to me.
3513580	3515580	I don't use my body to get attention.
3515580	3517580	So no one should.
3517580	3519580	The repressed feeling is
3519580	3521580	maybe I'm a little jealous that she's
3521580	3523580	getting all this attention by posting
3523580	3525580	thirst traps. But you don't think that.
3525580	3527580	You think, I
3527580	3529580	am above this. Because I
3529580	3531580	am chaste. I
3531580	3533580	have class. I
3533580	3535580	am a feminist. I would also
3535580	3537580	suggest accusing her of pandering to the
3537580	3539580	male gaze. That's, of course, the
3539580	3541580	feminist way of calling someone a
3541580	3543580	lowdown hobag skank.
3543580	3545580	So again we have envy to contempt
3545580	3547580	sublimation. And often the contempt
3547580	3549580	is moral. Virtuous.
3549580	3551580	The psychological
3551580	3553580	need to convince ourselves
3553580	3555580	that envy is morality
3555580	3557580	can become so strong
3557580	3559580	that we actually start inventing things
3559580	3561580	to be outraged about. Take
3561580	3563580	for instance the tendency to imagine
3563580	3565580	that the wealthy and powerful are
3565580	3567580	enjoying wild satanic
3567580	3569580	orgies and indulging all the
3569580	3571580	forbidden salacious pleasures
3571580	3573580	that we ourselves are denied.
3573580	3575580	Like QAnon, these conspiracy
3575580	3577580	theorists who want us to imagine
3577580	3579580	Hillary Clinton reclining
3579580	3581580	in a garden of earthly delights
3581580	3583580	sampling the pleasures of
3583580	3585580	ephibes.
3585580	3587580	Live, laugh, love
3587580	3589580	that for her. Envy is very
3589580	3591580	imaginative when it comes to the
3591580	3593580	hedonistic extravagance of the envied.
3593580	3595580	Let's talk about Marie Antoinette,
3595580	3597580	the queen of France who was guillotined
3597580	3599580	by the revolution. If you know
3599580	3601580	one thing about Marie Antoinette,
3601580	3603580	it's probably that when she heard about a family
3603580	3605580	famine where the people had no bread,
3605580	3607580	she infamously responded,
3607580	3609580	let them eat cake.
3609580	3611580	What an evil bitch.
3611580	3613580	How could she say that? Well,
3613580	3615580	she didn't.
3615580	3617580	She never said it.
3617580	3619580	It's a lie. The phrase
3619580	3621580	let them eat cake, originally
3621580	3623580	let them eat brioche, first appeared
3623580	3625580	in Rousseau's Confessions, written in
3625580	3627580	1765 when Marie
3627580	3629580	Antoinette was nine years old.
3629580	3631580	Rousseau attributed the line to
3631580	3633580	a great princess.
3633580	3635580	It's probably no one ever said this.
3635580	3637580	It's kind of like how the most famous photo
3637580	3639580	of Paris Hilton is the one where
3639580	3641580	she's wearing a stop being poor
3641580	3643580	t-shirt. What an evil
3643580	3645580	bitch. How could she wear that?
3645580	3647580	Well, she didn't.
3647580	3649580	It's photoshopped.
3649580	3651580	The actual shirt said stop being
3651580	3653580	desperate. Envy likes to
3653580	3655580	fabricate the diabolical
3655580	3657580	crimes of its enemies. I assume
3657580	3659580	to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.
3659580	3661580	I mean, what is a Disney villain
3661580	3663580	if not an opulent homosexual
3663580	3665580	seen through the eyes of the envious?
3665580	3667580	I'm gonna try lowering
3667580	3669580	the ISO because it's so f***ing bright in here
3669580	3671580	now. Okay, well it's a
3671580	3673580	much lower ISO. What if I get another
3673580	3675580	white over here? That's what this channel's really about.
3675580	3677580	One biological female's quest
3677580	3679580	to create a harmonious color story.
3679580	3681580	In the years leading up to and
3681580	3683580	during the French Revolution,
3683580	3685580	Marie Antoinette was constantly defamed
3685580	3687580	in these sleazy tabloids
3687580	3689580	called libelle.
3689580	3691580	It's the same root as the English word libel.
3691580	3693580	The often pornographic libelle
3693580	3695580	depicted the queen as a bisexual
3695580	3697580	demon who was constantly having
3697580	3699580	drunken orgies and sexually manipulating
3699580	3701580	everyone around her. All of which
3701580	3703580	is very interesting, but
3703580	3705580	none of which is true.
3705580	3707580	The historian Robert Darnton called it
3707580	3709580	an avalanche of defamation
3709580	3711580	that has no parallel in the
3711580	3713580	history of vilification. This
3713580	3715580	woman took the blame,
3715580	3717580	the moral blame, for the
3717580	3719580	structural failings of a broken
3719580	3721580	economic system. And by the time
3721580	3723580	she was brought before the revolutionary tribe
3723580	3725580	in 1793,
3725580	3727580	the actual person Marie Antoinette
3727580	3729580	had long ago been overshadowed
3729580	3731580	by the libellous caricature of her.
3731580	3733580	Now there was maybe one
3733580	3735580	good reason for executing the former
3735580	3737580	queen, which is that the legitimacy
3737580	3739580	of your new republic is a
3739580	3741580	little more secure when you don't have
3741580	3743580	living monarchs hanging around.
3743580	3745580	Someone better tell the English.
3745580	3747580	But the problem with that reasoning
3747580	3749580	is it has nothing to do with whether
3749580	3751580	or not the queen deserved
3751580	3753580	to die. And beheading a recently
3753580	3755580	widowed mother of two in front of
3755580	3757580	a jeering crowd for political expediency
3757580	3759580	might weigh a little
3759580	3761580	heavy on the conscience.
3761580	3763580	So the revolution had to convince themselves
3763580	3765580	that the queen deserved it.
3765580	3767580	Which was pretty easy after decades
3767580	3769580	of, again, false and
3769580	3771580	defamatory gossip. In her biography
3771580	3773580	of Marie Antoinette, Antonia
3773580	3775580	Frazier describes how
3775580	3777580	the prison guards separated Marie
3777580	3779580	from her eight-year-old son, who they
3779580	3781580	plied with alcohol and groomed
3781580	3783580	into accusing his own mother
3783580	3785580	of incestuous abuse.
3785580	3787580	To justify killing Marie
3787580	3789580	Antoinette, they had to destroy
3789580	3791580	the idea of this woman
3791580	3793580	as a mother. So she was convicted
3793580	3795580	of what may as well have been
3795580	3797580	crimes against ethics in games journalism
3797580	3799580	and sent to the guillotine
3799580	3801580	where her last words were
3801580	3803580	sorry to the executioner for
3803580	3805580	stepping on his foot.
3805580	3807580	Uh, women stop
3807580	3809580	apologizing challenge. This is what a
3809580	3811580	girl boss winning looks like.
3811580	3813580	So Marie Antoinette literally
3813580	3815580	did nothing wrong.
3815580	3817580	Hey, how are you?
3817580	3819580	An innocent milf was killed
3819580	3821580	that day and I, for one,
3821580	3823580	won't stand for it.
3823580	3825580	So look, we have a
3825580	3827580	psychological incentive
3827580	3829580	to believe that people whom
3829580	3831580	we envy are immoral monsters.
3831580	3833580	Because then, we get to label our
3833580	3835580	hatred and violence toward them justice.
3835580	3837580	Cruelty generally
3837580	3839580	cannot conceptualize itself
3839580	3841580	as cruelty. And part of the
3841580	3843580	reason for that is that calling
3843580	3845580	cruelty what it is
3845580	3847580	takes the fun out of it.
3847580	3849580	It reminds me of the second best day
3849580	3851580	in the history of Twitter.
3851580	3853580	October 1st, 2020.
3853580	3855580	The day that Trump got COVID.
3855580	3857580	And I'm gonna be honest, I have never
3857580	3859580	felt more schadenfreude
3859580	3861580	in my entire life.
3861580	3863580	Well, well, well.
3863580	3865580	If it isn't the leopards eating people's faces
3865580	3867580	party having their faces eaten by
3867580	3869580	leopards.
3873580	3875580	Last time I ate cake.
3875580	3877580	Like Dan Savage said,
3877580	3879580	it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.
3879580	3881580	The next day, I tweeted,
3881580	3883580	These last 24 hours have been the first time
3883580	3885580	I've genuinely enjoyed Twitter in years.
3885580	3887580	Because this website is good for one thing only,
3887580	3889580	reveling in the cruelest of human impulses.
3889580	3891580	And someone responded to that
3891580	3893580	saying,
3893580	3895580	Oh my god, could you even be
3895580	3897580	a bigger killjoy?
3897580	3899580	But why was I being a killjoy?
3899580	3901580	The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.
3901580	3903580	Well, for most people, I guess not
3903580	3905580	me, but for normal people,
3905580	3907580	for other girls, cruelty is only
3907580	3909580	pleasurable as long as they can convince
3909580	3911580	themselves it's something other than
3911580	3913580	cruelty. Justice served.
3913580	3915580	So again, reason,
3915580	3917580	rationality, are often the attempt
3917580	3919580	to publicly communicate,
3919580	3921580	to evangelize our
3921580	3923580	private feelings. And morality,
3923580	3925580	ethics, and justice
3925580	3927580	are often put forward
3927580	3929580	as the respectable public
3929580	3931580	face of private
3931580	3933580	envy, vindictiveness,
3933580	3935580	and hatred. But is this a
3935580	3937580	corruption of morality?
3937580	3939580	Or have we stumbled onto something
3939580	3941580	darker? What if morality
3941580	3943580	itself is simply the
3943580	3945580	expression of some kind of
3945580	3947580	sadomasochistic urge?
3947580	3949580	It's too early for this.
3949580	3951580	I mean, it's literally 7am
3951580	3953580	where I'm filming. I don't know how this keeps
3953580	3955580	happening to me. My head gets cut off one afternoon,
3955580	3957580	puts me in a philosophical mood.
3957580	3959580	The next morning,
3959580	3961580	I've stayed up all night and I'm still talking about
3961580	3963580	the philosophes.
3963580	3965580	Meow meow.
3965580	3967580	Hello again, kittens.
3967580	3969580	Let's talk about justice, uwu.
3969580	3971580	I look like a Supreme Court justice.
3971580	3973580	So nya? So to meow your?
3973580	3975580	It would actually be fierce if I wasn't,
3975580	3977580	you know, if I wasn't being nyadily.
3977580	3979580	Look, I've been seeing a lot
3979580	3981580	of comments lately along the lines of
3981580	3983580	Natalie used to do serious
3983580	3985580	academic arguments. Now she
3985580	3987580	only cares about makeup.
3987580	3989580	Alright, you little shits. You want
3989580	3991580	book learning? I'm gonna learn you so
3991580	3993580	hard. I'm gonna learn you so hard you're gonna
3993580	3995580	have a god damn
3995580	3997580	headache in the morning. Friedrich
3997580	3999580	Nietzsche. Friedrich
4001580	4003580	Wilhelm Nietzsche. Do you mind if I call you Fred?
4003580	4005580	Friedrich was a German philosopher
4005580	4007580	who had a lot to say about
4007580	4009580	envy and morality. But before
4009580	4011580	we get into that, I want to say a little bit about his
4011580	4013580	life, because it's just very
4013580	4015580	funny. Nietzsche's famous for his concept
4015580	4017580	of the Ubermensch, but Friedrich
4017580	4019580	sweet,
4019580	4021580	beautiful little Friedrich,
4021580	4023580	he was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.
4023580	4025580	Friedrich was a chronically
4025580	4027580	ill, chronically in pain,
4027580	4029580	nearly blind incel
4029580	4031580	who probably slept with a prostitute
4031580	4033580	once and got syphilis and
4033580	4035580	died. Life is
4035580	4037580	funny. Sad, but funny.
4037580	4039580	In the introduction to Beyond
4039580	4041580	Good and Evil, the editor says
4041580	4043580	though he prided himself on being
4043580	4045580	comfortable with women, he does not seem to have been
4045580	4047580	very successful in establishing emotionally
4047580	4049580	satisfying relationships with them,
4049580	4051580	which is hardly surprising.
4051580	4053580	I love when the introduction to a book is just a
4053580	4055580	brutal roast of the author.
4055580	4057580	Who wrote this? Rolf Peter Horstmann.
4057580	4059580	You're killing it, Rolf. You're a savage.
4059580	4061580	I adore. Friedrich's books
4061580	4063580	sold a dismal number of copies
4063580	4065580	in his lifetime. What emerges
4065580	4067580	is a picture of a totally isolated,
4067580	4069580	highly neurotic man who had
4069580	4071580	to try hard to avoid thinking of
4071580	4073580	himself as a complete failure.
4075580	4077580	Aww. He was also doing huge doses of
4077580	4079580	opium, relatable, and writing himself
4079580	4081580	prescriptions for sleeping pills using
4081580	4083580	the name Dr. Nietzsche.
4083580	4085580	Dr. Nietzsche? Pretty sure I got a Xanax
4085580	4087580	prescription from that guy once.
4087580	4089580	Behind a Dairy Queen.
4089580	4091580	Nietzsche was also a failed musician and
4091580	4093580	was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's
4093580	4095580	wife.
4095580	4097580	The Virgin Nietzsche contra the
4097580	4099580	Chad Wagner. You beta cuck.
4099580	4101580	Why did I do that?
4101580	4103580	Can we all agree that Catgirl Nietzsche
4103580	4105580	is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?
4105580	4107580	I just want to mom this guy, honestly.
4107580	4109580	I don't even care that he's a misogynist.
4109580	4111580	His misogyny is simply
4111580	4113580	too sad to be offended by. You know, I think
4113580	4115580	it's interesting that a person this
4115580	4117580	pathetic can also be a genius
4117580	4119580	whose name will never die. He's someone
4119580	4121580	who had a lot of reason to be envious
4121580	4123580	and self-pitying, but his philosophy
4123580	4125580	couldn't be more against that.
4125580	4127580	And as a person of pathetic experience
4127580	4129580	myself, that is unironically kind
4129580	4131580	of inspiring to me. So let's
4131580	4133580	go in. In his book on the
4133580	4135580	genealogy of morality, Frederick
4135580	4137580	wants to explain the origin
4137580	4139580	of the concepts of good and evil.
4139580	4141580	Under what conditions did man invent
4141580	4143580	the value judgments good and evil, and
4143580	4145580	what value do they themselves have?
4145580	4147580	Have they to now obstructed or
4147580	4149580	promoted human flourishing? Hang on, my food's
4149580	4151580	here. That's right, you're getting a mukbang,
4151580	4153580	sweetie. Did you think I was gonna sit at this
4153580	4155580	giant table and not be eating something?
4155580	4157580	This video's been going on more than an hour, so I assume
4157580	4159580	you guys are drunk by now, and we're just kind of
4159580	4161580	hanging out at this point. You guys can't even
4161580	4163580	see. Well, here. I've got
4163580	4165580	a bunch of sushi, and it's my mission to eat
4165580	4167580	all of this while summarizing the entire life
4167580	4169580	and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.
4169580	4171580	Trisha Paytas, Nikocado, consider
4171580	4173580	this a challenge. So Frederick argues
4173580	4175580	that good and bad, not
4175580	4177580	good and evil, that's different, we'll get to that,
4177580	4179580	but good and bad were originally
4179580	4181580	the self-affirming values
4181580	4183580	of people with power.
4183580	4185580	So to be good meant to be powerful,
4185580	4187580	strong, beautiful, healthy.
4187580	4189580	And to be bad meant to be
4189580	4191580	weak, sick,
4191580	4193580	common, ugly.
4193580	4195580	I'm gonna eat one like a cat.
4195580	4197580	And Frederick supports this speculation
4197580	4199580	with etymology. So in a lot
4199580	4201580	of languages, the word that means morally
4201580	4203580	good or spiritually noble
4203580	4205580	originally meant noble in the sense
4205580	4207580	of aristocratic, the propertied
4207580	4209580	class. Like in Buddhism,
4209580	4211580	the Arya Satyani, that's
4211580	4213580	Sanskrit for noble truths.
4213580	4215580	Arya means noble.
4215580	4217580	And Arya is used to mean spiritually
4217580	4219580	noble, but earlier it meant
4219580	4221580	the aristocracy, the rich.
4221580	4223580	And originally, it was just the name that a culture
4223580	4225580	in northern India gave themselves,
4225580	4227580	the Aryans. I'm really
4227580	4229580	working not to get soy sauce on this list.
4229580	4231580	This was later misunderstood by Europeans
4231580	4233580	who wrongly thought
4233580	4235580	that Aryan was a race.
4235580	4237580	Oops.
4237580	4239580	Goddammit.
4239580	4241580	Goddammit, kids. Can we not?
4241580	4243580	Frederick traces the origin of the
4243580	4245580	German word gut, or the English
4245580	4247580	good, to the name of the Goths.
4247580	4249580	No, not those Goths.
4249580	4251580	The Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.
4251580	4253580	Frederick calls them the blonde
4253580	4255580	beasts of prey. I like to
4255580	4257580	stalk my prey in the small hours
4257580	4259580	of the night.
4259580	4261580	The German word schlecht, which means
4261580	4263580	bad, is related to schlicht, which
4263580	4265580	means plain, simple, originally
4265580	4267580	common, low, not
4267580	4269580	aristocratic, not noble.
4269580	4271580	So good and bad
4271580	4273580	were originally the values of warrior
4273580	4275580	aristocrats who were like Homeric
4275580	4277580	heroes celebrating themselves.
4277580	4279580	And Frederick calls their value
4279580	4281580	system master morality.
4281580	4283580	This glorification of combat,
4283580	4285580	feasting, athleticism,
4285580	4287580	sexual conquest,
4287580	4289580	beauty. These things
4289580	4291580	were called good. And their
4291580	4293580	opposites, weakness, impotence,
4293580	4295580	ugliness, were called bad.
4295580	4297580	The ancient nobles worshipped
4297580	4299580	noble gods who acted like them
4299580	4301580	and shared their values. I mean, if I created
4301580	4303580	a personal goddess, I think we all know
4303580	4305580	what animal that would be. Me and the ancient
4305580	4307580	Egyptians on the same page. So for
4307580	4309580	example, Roman warriors could
4309580	4311580	worship Mars, the god of war.
4311580	4313580	And it was like they were worshipping themselves.
4313580	4315580	They were dumb jocks, worshipping
4315580	4317580	dumb jock gods. Well, good for them.
4317580	4319580	But what about the people who got shoved
4319580	4321580	into lockers? Well,
4321580	4323580	Frederick's example, and this is gonna
4323580	4325580	create some misunderstandings later,
4325580	4327580	but his example is
4327580	4329580	the Jews who were colonized
4329580	4331580	by the Romans in Judea.
4331580	4333580	And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try
4333580	4335580	to revolt. Oh, they did.
4335580	4337580	Multiple times.
4337580	4339580	But for several centuries, the Romans were
4339580	4341580	just too powerful. No one could stop
4341580	4343580	them. So the question is, what
4343580	4345580	happens psychologically to people
4345580	4347580	who are oppressed and who lack the
4347580	4349580	power to overthrow the oppressor?
4349580	4351580	Well, in that case,
4351580	4353580	frustrated vindictiveness builds over
4353580	4355580	time to become this deep
4355580	4357580	bitterness which Nietzsche gave the French
4357580	4359580	name, Résentiment.
4359580	4361580	Resentment in English.
4365580	4367580	I don't speak French. I just enjoy
4367580	4369580	making vaguely French noises.
4373580	4375580	I don't like the English, but I like the French even less.
4375580	4377580	Because they're always dressed so well, and they speak a sexier language
4377580	4379580	than me. Stop it! This is your final
4379580	4381580	warning, comprendez-vous? Good wine, though.
4381580	4383580	I'll give them that. So there's a German word,
4383580	4385580	Neid, which means envy.
4385580	4387580	So why is Frederick using this
4387580	4389580	French term, Résentiment?
4389580	4391580	What's going on, Frederick? Why are you speaking
4391580	4393580	French? Are you nervous?
4393580	4395580	You trying to impress me? Nietzsche must
4395580	4397580	have said Résentiment because he thought
4397580	4399580	it was something different than envy.
4399580	4401580	I think the difference is resentment,
4401580	4403580	and I'm just gonna use the English word so I don't sound like an
4403580	4405580	asshole. Resentment is born
4405580	4407580	not just of wanting what someone
4407580	4409580	has, but of a permanent frustration
4409580	4411580	of the desire for resentment.
4411580	4413580	Revenge. It's born of weakness,
4413580	4415580	inability to get revenge.
4415580	4417580	Now revenge itself
4417580	4419580	implies weakness, at least a
4419580	4421580	temporary weakness. We say revenge
4421580	4423580	is best served cold,
4423580	4425580	but actually, revenge is only
4425580	4427580	served cold.
4427580	4429580	If it's served hot, if someone slaps
4429580	4431580	you and you slap them back immediately,
4431580	4433580	that's retaliation, not revenge.
4433580	4435580	You brought
4435580	4437580	this on yourself. Revenge is only
4437580	4439580	a possibility when you can't
4439580	4441580	retaliate immediately. So you become
4441580	4443580	vindictive. You start plotting and
4443580	4445580	scheming. But if you're too weak,
4445580	4447580	too impotent to have any
4447580	4449580	hope of revenge, then you become
4449580	4451580	resentful. So Nietzsche's argument is
4451580	4453580	that a person who's too weak to get material
4453580	4455580	revenge can instead
4455580	4457580	get psychological revenge
4457580	4459580	by creating a new morality.
4459580	4461580	In Frederick's words,
4461580	4463580	the beginning of the slave's revolt
4463580	4465580	in morality occurs when
4465580	4467580	Résentiment itself turns creative
4467580	4469580	and gives birth to values.
4469580	4471580	This is a little high concept for a mukbang,
4471580	4473580	isn't it? What are you doing, Frederick?
4473580	4475580	So while master morality says that good
4475580	4477580	is power, riches, health, and
4477580	4479580	strength, and bad is the
4479580	4481580	opposite, slave morality,
4481580	4483580	the morality of resentment, says
4483580	4485580	blessed are the poor, the
4485580	4487580	meek, the sick, the powerless.
4487580	4489580	This is the good
4489580	4491580	of slave morality, and its opposite
4491580	4493580	is not the bad, but a new concept,
4493580	4495580	the evil. And what
4495580	4497580	is evil? Well, everything
4497580	4499580	that master morality says is good.
4499580	4501580	Power. Wealth.
4501580	4503580	Conquest. Sexual
4503580	4505580	satisfaction.
4509580	4511580	He's talking about
4511580	4513580	Christianity here, he's not talking about
4513580	4515580	Judaism. But Frederick thinks of
4515580	4517580	Christianity as the spiritual revenge
4517580	4519580	of the Jews against the Romans,
4519580	4521580	an inversion of the empire's
4521580	4523580	values. But he also thinks
4523580	4525580	that slave morality is fundamentally
4525580	4527580	dishonest. It's like the fox
4527580	4529580	and the grapes. Not being
4529580	4531580	able to take revenge is called
4531580	4533580	not wanting to take revenge.
4533580	4535580	It might even be called
4535580	4537580	forgiveness. Slave morality
4537580	4539580	says that weakness is
4539580	4541580	righteous. Submission to people you
4541580	4543580	hate is called obedience.
4543580	4545580	Having to wait is
4545580	4547580	called patience.
4547580	4549580	Inability to satisfy sexual desire
4549580	4551580	is called chastity,
4551580	4553580	purity, and so on. And while
4553580	4555580	master morality is born of saying
4555580	4557580	yes to yourself, as a powerful,
4557580	4559580	noble beast
4559580	4561580	of prey, slave morality
4561580	4563580	is born of saying no
4563580	4565580	to the master and everything he has
4565580	4567580	that you can't. I like to have
4567580	4569580	my belly rubbed. Scratch my
4569580	4571580	back above my tail, please.
4571580	4573580	I'm gonna put the rest of the fish away because it's getting warm
4573580	4575580	and I'm full. This has not been a successful
4575580	4577580	mukbang. It turns out that it's actually very difficult
4577580	4579580	to do a mukbang while
4579580	4581580	talking. I should have thought this through a little harder.
4581580	4583580	So slave morality is born of a repressed
4583580	4585580	desire for revenge, but that desire
4585580	4587580	for revenge never completely disappears.
4587580	4589580	It's there, for example, in the Christian
4589580	4591580	idea of the Last Judgment.
4591580	4593580	No need to take revenge
4593580	4595580	against the wicked, my sheep. God
4595580	4597580	will do that for us. And in the meantime,
4597580	4599580	being weak
4599580	4601580	is good, actually.
4601580	4603580	I find this book thrilling
4603580	4605580	to read, honestly. And I'm not
4605580	4607580	easily thrilled. Especially not
4607580	4609580	by philosophers. I think this book in particular
4609580	4611580	gets me because, especially
4611580	4613580	if you were raised Christian, this is
4613580	4615580	so the opposite of everything
4615580	4617580	you were ever taught to believe that it almost feels
4617580	4619580	like, dirty.
4619580	4621580	Should I be reading this? Is this allowed?
4621580	4623580	Because even if you're not religious,
4623580	4625580	most of us still agree with a lot of
4625580	4627580	Christian morality. Like, yeah, Jesus
4627580	4629580	was a good guy. Blessed
4629580	4631580	are the meek. Sure. But then
4631580	4633580	Frederick comes along and he's like,
4633580	4635580	hmm, morality is just a cope
4635580	4637580	for frustrated vindictiveness.
4637580	4639580	And you're like, I need to lie down.
4639580	4641580	Where's my smelling salts?
4651580	4653580	But wait, there's more.
4653580	4655580	This gets even darker. Nietzsche
4655580	4657580	thinks that over the last two millennia of European
4657580	4659580	history, slave morality has
4659580	4661580	triumphed. Saint Paul made
4661580	4663580	Christianity marketable, the
4663580	4665580	Emperor Constantine converted,
4665580	4667580	and by the Middle Ages, even
4667580	4669580	kings and aristocrats were kneeling down
4669580	4671580	not to powerful warrior gods
4671580	4673580	made in their own image, but to
4673580	4675580	a god that was weak.
4675580	4677580	Suffering. Victimized.
4677580	4679580	Oppressed.
4679580	4681580	Mmm. So by the 19th
4681580	4683580	century, slave morality had become
4683580	4685580	the only morality.
4685580	4687580	And it's not just Christianity, either.
4687580	4689580	The secular version of these values
4689580	4691580	became socialism, anarchism.
4691580	4693580	About freethinkers and
4693580	4695580	atheists, Nietzsche has this
4695580	4697580	to say.
4701580	4703580	Okay, the poison.
4703580	4705580	What is the poison?
4705580	4707580	Well, Frederick thinks that resentment
4707580	4709580	poisons the mind,
4709580	4711580	and turns humans against our own
4711580	4713580	natural instincts. Not just against
4713580	4715580	aggression, but against sexuality,
4715580	4717580	against ambition,
4717580	4719580	against power, against life
4719580	4721580	itself. And there's two possible
4721580	4723580	outcomes of this. One is
4723580	4725580	that resentment becomes a political
4725580	4727580	movement. The conspiracy of those
4727580	4729580	who suffer. The tyranny of
4729580	4731580	the herd. The revolution
4731580	4733580	that eats itself. Only we
4733580	4735580	are good and just, is what they say.
4735580	4737580	As though health, success, strength,
4737580	4739580	pride, and the feeling of power
4739580	4741580	were in themselves depravities
4741580	4743580	for which penance, bitter penance
4743580	4745580	will one day be exacted. Among them
4745580	4747580	we find plenty of vengeance seekers
4747580	4749580	disguised as judges
4749580	4751580	with the word justice continually in their mouth
4751580	4753580	like poisonous spittle.
4753580	4755580	So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic
4755580	4757580	resentment mob. Which I'm sure
4757580	4759580	we're all familiar with. The other outcome
4759580	4761580	is that this moralism turns
4761580	4763580	inward and attacks the individual
4763580	4765580	conscience, producing
4765580	4767580	asceticism, self-denial,
4767580	4769580	guilt. Because slave morality
4769580	4771580	condemns not only the external
4771580	4773580	beasts of prey who are oppressing us
4773580	4775580	but also the beast
4775580	4777580	of prey within. Our own
4777580	4779580	animal instincts. What Christianity
4779580	4781580	calls sin.
4781580	4783580	So Frederick thinks that modern humans
4783580	4785580	have become sick.
4785580	4787580	We hate ourselves. We hate our
4787580	4789580	own nature. We hate
4789580	4791580	life itself. I mean
4791580	4793580	is he wrong? You see a girl
4793580	4795580	boss winning. I only
4795580	4797580	see the will to power.
4797580	4799580	Frederick thinks of modern men as
4799580	4801580	once proud wildcats who
4801580	4803580	become domesticated house pets
4803580	4805580	at the cost of everything
4805580	4807580	great in the human spirit.
4807580	4809580	That's very valid
4809580	4811580	Frederick.
4811580	4813580	That's super hecking
4813580	4815580	valid. So look I've been
4815580	4817580	pretty positive about Nietzsche so far
4817580	4819580	but I do have a couple critiques I want to say.
4819580	4821580	One is that Frederick
4821580	4823580	associating slave morality with
4823580	4825580	the Jews is very irresponsible.
4825580	4827580	Even though he didn't intend to be
4827580	4829580	anti-semitic and even though he was outspoken
4829580	4831580	against anti-semitism in his own time
4831580	4833580	when you keep referring to the Christian
4833580	4835580	values you're critiquing as
4835580	4837580	Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge
4837580	4839580	some people might get
4839580	4841580	the wrong idea. And some people did
4841580	4843580	Frederick. Like your dumbass sister
4843580	4845580	Elizabeth Nietzsche who became a literal
4845580	4847580	alternative
4847580	4849580	ethno-identitarian. God damn it
4849580	4851580	Liz. Kind of goth goals though.
4851580	4853580	Yes that kind of goth. You're
4853580	4855580	right this time. My other critique is that
4855580	4857580	it doesn't seem to have occurred to Frederick
4857580	4859580	that genuinely caring about other people
4859580	4861580	is an option. Like not because
4861580	4863580	caring about other people is repressing your
4863580	4865580	true selfish nature, but just because
4865580	4867580	caring about other people is
4867580	4869580	part of your nature. And isn't it?
4869580	4871580	Isn't caring about other people
4871580	4873580	also in our nature? I do think
4873580	4875580	most of what Nietzsche says about resentment
4875580	4877580	accurately describes a
4877580	4879580	very real thing. But it's not
4879580	4881580	the only thing. There is genuine
4881580	4883580	care and love in this world
4883580	4885580	I've been told. I've heard rumors.
4885580	4887580	And I'm even gonna go so far as to say
4887580	4889580	hashtag not all Christians. Christ
4889580	4891580	I'm defending the Christians. What does this channel
4891580	4893580	come to? There are Christians
4893580	4895580	maybe not most, but still some
4895580	4897580	for whom love and forgiveness
4897580	4899580	are genuine experiences
4899580	4901580	and not just some kind of
4901580	4903580	twisted impotent
4903580	4905580	passive aggressive vengeance.
4905580	4907580	Where I agree with Nietzsche and with Freud
4907580	4909580	is I do think a lot of the
4909580	4911580	emotional foundation of justice
4911580	4913580	and morality is
4913580	4915580	retribution, envy
4915580	4917580	or some combination of the two.
4917580	4919580	But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.
4919580	4921580	There's a famous Martin Luther King
4921580	4923580	quote responding to Nietzsche
4923580	4925580	What is needed is a realization
4925580	4927580	that power
4927580	4929580	without love is reckless
4929580	4931580	and abusive and that love without power
4931580	4933580	is sentimental and anemic.
4933580	4935580	Power at its best
4935580	4937580	is love
4937580	4939580	implementing the demands of justice
4939580	4941580	and justice at its
4941580	4943580	best is love correcting
4943580	4945580	everything that stands
4945580	4947580	against love.
4947580	4949580	So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche
4949580	4951580	that to simply call power
4951580	4953580	evil is a sickness
4953580	4955580	anemic. But there still needs
4955580	4957580	to be some kind of emotional or spiritual
4957580	4959580	force that keeps humanity
4959580	4961580	from tearing itself apart. And maybe
4961580	4963580	something like this Christian idea
4963580	4965580	of love for humanity is the missing
4965580	4967580	piece. Because without something like that
4967580	4969580	I just see retribution
4969580	4971580	and envy snowballing
4971580	4973580	into human self destruction.
4973580	4975580	And I hate that for us. It's not very
4975580	4977580	sliving of us. Do you guys know about sliving?
4977580	4979580	Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's
4979580	4981580	YouTube channel? She doesn't have as many subscribers
4981580	4983580	as I do but you know. I try to support
4983580	4985580	smaller creators.
4985580	4987580	Sliving is basically slaying and living
4987580	4989580	your best life into one word. It's the new
4989580	4991580	that's hot. Maybe I'll do a video about
4991580	4993580	love when I'm in a better mood.
4993580	4995580	So for now, well
4995580	4997580	let's put it this way. God is
4997580	4999580	dead and we have killed
4999580	5001580	him, yeah?
5001580	5003580	It's living.
5011580	5013580	So let us give him
5013580	5015580	all we see.
5019580	5021580	Okay. I'm moisturized. I'm primed.
5021580	5023580	I've proven my academic credentials.
5023580	5025580	Now it's time to do my makeup.
5025580	5027580	That's right children, I'm going full
5027580	5029580	Bailey Sarian. I'm going full
5029580	5031580	suspish. So I guess I should
5031580	5033580	say something about the political implications
5033580	5035580	of all this since, uh, I guess
5035580	5037580	this channel's about politics. Sometimes
5037580	5039580	I have to read my own Wikipedia article
5039580	5041580	to remember what I'm doing with my life.
5041580	5043580	But this morality of resentment,
5043580	5045580	of impotence, and permanently
5045580	5047580	frustrated revenge, judges
5047580	5049580	that power
5049580	5051580	is evil. I don't use foundation, I just
5051580	5053580	use concealer. I know that's like not
5053580	5055580	how you're supposed to do makeup, but I don't need to be good
5055580	5057580	at makeup, okay? I have a million subscribers on
5057580	5059580	YouTube. I don't need to be good.
5059580	5061580	There was a New York Times article about young
5061580	5063580	women's attitudes toward political ambition
5063580	5065580	and one of the women who was interviewed said
5065580	5067580	as a white woman, I know
5067580	5069580	I have unearned privilege. So
5069580	5071580	am I really the best person to be in leadership?
5071580	5073580	Uh, yes.
5073580	5075580	Yes you are. Because we need leaders
5075580	5077580	like you who are capable of
5077580	5079580	questioning the legitimacy of their own
5079580	5081580	authority. Otherwise, we're
5081580	5083580	just going to be stuck with another blonde beast of
5083580	5085580	prey. And of course it's good to be
5085580	5087580	aware of your privilege, especially
5087580	5089580	as a leader, but let's not be so
5089580	5091580	self-effacing that we efface
5091580	5093580	ourselves off the face of the earth.
5093580	5095580	This is the self-sabotage of
5095580	5097580	resentment values. If you think
5097580	5099580	power is evil, then you've given
5099580	5101580	up on the ambition to acquire any
5101580	5103580	power, which virtually guarantees
5103580	5105580	your political irrelevance, since
5105580	5107580	like MLK said, you have to at least
5107580	5109580	have some power to implement
5109580	5111580	the demands of justice. Remember
5111580	5113580	what incels call taking the black
5113580	5115580	pill, this conviction that the reason
5115580	5117580	you don't have a girlfriend is just that you're
5117580	5119580	genetically undesirable. There's
5119580	5121580	nothing you can do to change it, and
5121580	5123580	I guess women are just too shallow
5123580	5125580	to be attracted to all the amazing hatred
5125580	5127580	and spite that festers in your heart.
5127580	5129580	For a lot of black-pilled incels,
5129580	5131580	it seems like there's only one thing left in
5131580	5133580	life that they enjoy, which is
5133580	5135580	simply the pleasure of complaining.
5135580	5137580	Of moaning in pain.
5137580	5139580	It reminds me of a comment from
5139580	5141580	Dostoevsky's second most
5141580	5143580	horrible protagonist.
5143580	5145580	Even in toothache there is enjoyment.
5145580	5147580	In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence
5147580	5149580	but moan. But they are not candid
5149580	5151580	moans, they are malignant moans.
5151580	5153580	And the malignancy is the whole point.
5153580	5155580	The moan is a protest
5155580	5157580	against the meaninglessness of pain.
5157580	5159580	And part of the satisfaction of
5159580	5161580	moaning is inflicting your
5161580	5163580	pain on other people.
5163580	5165580	This kind of malignant moaning,
5165580	5167580	it's kind of the opposite of music.
5167580	5169580	Because a lot of music, like blues,
5169580	5171580	is benevolent moaning
5171580	5173580	that transforms pain into pleasure.
5173580	5175580	I mean, that's what blues is all about.
5175580	5177580	My woman don't love me no more, but I know her
5177580	5179580	sister will. You know, optimism.
5179580	5181580	I think a lot of incel discourse
5181580	5183580	is really just malignant moaning.
5183580	5185580	Right, it's not an attempt to diagnose
5185580	5187580	or solve any problem.
5187580	5189580	It's just a contagious expression of misery.
5189580	5191580	A moan of pain that
5191580	5193580	masquerades as a political agenda.
5193580	5195580	Sexual Marxism, they call it.
5195580	5197580	The redistribution of sex.
5197580	5199580	State-mandated GFs.
5199580	5201580	That's very valid.
5201580	5203580	Of course, they don't actually expect any of this
5203580	5205580	to happen. That's not
5205580	5207580	the point. So incels are kind of
5207580	5209580	a universal punching bag online.
5209580	5211580	It's very easy to point and laugh
5211580	5213580	at them. But what's harder is to look
5213580	5215580	in the mirror and notice how these
5215580	5217580	exact same tendencies
5217580	5219580	are rampant in our own communities.
5219580	5221580	So the incel black pill is just one
5221580	5223580	instance of what I call an ideology
5223580	5225580	of resentment. A discourse
5225580	5227580	that outwardly appears like moral
5227580	5229580	or political critique, but which on examination
5229580	5231580	is mainly just a resentful
5231580	5233580	moan. The goal of resentment
5233580	5235580	politics is not to improve
5235580	5237580	conditions. In fact, the
5237580	5239580	resentful person is full of contempt
5239580	5241580	for any morally compromised
5241580	5243580	sellouts who are
5243580	5245580	attempting to enact plausible reforms.
5245580	5247580	They don't want victory.
5247580	5249580	They don't want power. They want to endlessly
5249580	5251580	critique power.
5251580	5253580	Because for them, critique is
5253580	5255580	an important psychological defense
5255580	5257580	against feeling
5257580	5259580	impotent. Shaler described
5259580	5261580	it this way.
5269580	5271580	What am I going to do with my eyes?
5271580	5273580	I think a pink kind of
5273580	5275580	look. We've been doing a lot of pink looks.
5275580	5277580	I love that hay fever look.
5277580	5279580	As a general rule, the more radical
5279580	5281580	a political community claims to be,
5281580	5283580	the more likely it is
5283580	5285580	to be a community of resentment.
5285580	5287580	Self-styled radicals will tell you,
5287580	5289580	superficial surface reforms do not
5289580	5291580	interest us. The problem must
5291580	5293580	be critiqued at its root.
5293580	5295580	And then the root turns out to be this universal
5295580	5297580	all-encompassing evil, right?
5297580	5299580	Society itself.
5299580	5301580	The system. The machine.
5301580	5303580	A resentment ideologue always
5303580	5305580	imagines himself to be engaged in a
5305580	5307580	kind of satanic revolt
5307580	5309580	against an omnipotent,
5309580	5311580	omnipresent enemy. Okay,
5311580	5313580	I need to do makeup for a second.
5313580	5315580	It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.
5315580	5317580	It's hard to talk while doing this. And nothing short of
5317580	5319580	total revolution counts as any sort of
5319580	5321580	victory whatsoever. We have to dismantle
5321580	5323580	the entire system.
5323580	5325580	Burn it all down.
5325580	5327580	I guess it's pedestrian to point out that this is
5327580	5329580	the revolutionary utopian equivalent
5329580	5331580	of Christians awaiting the last judgment.
5331580	5333580	Our kingdom is coming, comrades!
5333580	5335580	Often the appeal of utopian
5335580	5337580	ideology is similar to religion.
5337580	5339580	It's not about healthcare,
5339580	5341580	higher wages,
5341580	5343580	relief from police violence.
5343580	5345580	Those are actual goals that could be
5345580	5347580	demanded, worked for, and achieved.
5347580	5349580	Utopian ideology instead
5349580	5351580	promises relief from some
5351580	5353580	general malaise.
5353580	5355580	Alienation.
5355580	5357580	And so ironically, it can have the same
5357580	5359580	opiate effect that Marx ascribes
5359580	5361580	to religion. But release from
5361580	5363580	the general anguish of human existence
5363580	5365580	is not a political goal.
5365580	5367580	There's been many revolutions in the last
5367580	5369580	few centuries, and so far
5369580	5371580	zero utopias.
5371580	5373580	Resentment, envy,
5373580	5375580	and hunger, for that matter,
5375580	5377580	are not satiated by the downfall
5377580	5379580	of the old regime. When the people
5379580	5381580	have no bread, they eat the rich.
5381580	5383580	And when the rich
5383580	5385580	are gone, they eat
5385580	5387580	each other. And because of the proximity
5387580	5389580	effect, envy may actually
5389580	5391580	increase after the revolution.
5391580	5393580	You may actually be more envious of a
5393580	5395580	favored comrade, a
5395580	5397580	successful citoyen, oui,
5397580	5399580	a kulak, than you ever were of the
5399580	5401580	aristocrats. So envy turns
5401580	5403580	paranoid and imaginative
5403580	5405580	in revolutionary moments.
5405580	5407580	It gets sublimated into morality,
5407580	5409580	and the accusations
5409580	5411580	start flying. That citizen
5411580	5413580	is conspiring against the revolution.
5413580	5415580	That peasant is hoarding grain.
5415580	5417580	So the guillotine starts slicing
5417580	5419580	thousands of heads off, the gulags
5419580	5421580	fill up, or an authoritarian
5421580	5423580	strongman takes over just to
5423580	5425580	announce another revolution
5425580	5427580	two decades later. The things people will do
5427580	5429580	to stay relevant, honestly.
5429580	5431580	And for what? What long-term
5431580	5433580	egalitarian utopia results?
5433580	5435580	Socialism with Chinese characteristics?
5437580	5439580	So look, I do understand
5439580	5441580	that sometimes you just have to
5441580	5443580	do a revolution. And if I'd been there in
5443580	5445580	1789, I'm sure
5445580	5447580	I'd be storming the Bastille myself.
5447580	5449580	But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.
5449580	5451580	Revolution is a bloody nightmare that
5451580	5453580	happens because society is collapsing
5453580	5455580	and people are desperate. At worst,
5455580	5457580	revolution is nothing more than a
5457580	5459580	violent day of retribution. And at
5459580	5461580	best, it lays the groundwork for future
5461580	5463580	incremental progress. But it will never
5463580	5465580	usher in utopia, nor is it the
5465580	5467580	antidote to a vague sense of unease, which
5467580	5469580	I'm sorry to report, is
5469580	5471580	simply the resting state of an unsedated
5471580	5473580	human mind. Now I'm not
5473580	5475580	saying, as some conservatives do,
5475580	5477580	that all leftist or all
5477580	5479580	egalitarian politics is born of
5479580	5481580	envy. No. This is a
5481580	5483580	specific subtype. There are
5483580	5485580	plenty of reasons, other than
5485580	5487580	envy or fear of envy, to oppose
5487580	5489580	an economic distribution where
5489580	5491580	some people have billions of dollars
5491580	5493580	while other people are dying because they can't afford
5493580	5495580	insulin. Objectively, that is
5495580	5497580	not an efficient use of resources to
5497580	5499580	promote human well-being. And personally,
5499580	5501580	I just don't want to live in a country
5501580	5503580	where people are dying because they
5503580	5505580	can't afford medicine. And I'm willing to pay
5505580	5507580	however many taxes it takes
5507580	5509580	for that not to happen. So while I'm
5509580	5511580	putting down straw-man versions of my
5511580	5513580	argument, I'm also not
5513580	5515580	saying, oh, let's just stop being
5515580	5517580	envious. No. That's
5517580	5519580	impossible. I think envy is like libido.
5519580	5521580	It's a basic force of human
5521580	5523580	nature that's more or less
5523580	5525580	unstoppable. But with the right leadership,
5525580	5527580	I think that envy can
5527580	5529580	potentially be sublimated
5529580	5531580	or redirected into something
5531580	5533580	more constructive. Because raw
5533580	5535580	envy is a very bad
5535580	5537580	basis for egalitarian politics.
5537580	5539580	It often targets the wrong people,
5539580	5541580	like millionaires instead of billionaires.
5541580	5543580	And eventually, it turns the revolution against
5543580	5545580	itself. And you get the circular firing
5545580	5547580	squad. The self-cannibalism.
5547580	5549580	The problem I see on the left today
5549580	5551580	is that without any genuine political
5551580	5553580	outlet, resentment mostly manifests
5553580	5555580	as morality. Morality
5555580	5557580	itself being a way to
5557580	5559580	vent envious aggression and vindictiveness.
5559580	5561580	On the left, we claim to be so
5561580	5563580	impersonal, right? We're all about structural
5563580	5565580	analysis. The material
5565580	5567580	conditions. Systems of
5567580	5569580	power. Intersectional identity
5569580	5571580	hierarchies. But if you look at what people
5571580	5573580	actually spend their time doing here,
5573580	5575580	it's all this obsessive moral
5575580	5577580	policing. I wonder if because
5577580	5579580	leftists can't seem to win on any
5579580	5581580	major political stage, we feel
5581580	5583580	disempowered. And so this moral
5583580	5585580	fanaticism is a
5585580	5587580	psychological substitute. Like with Marie
5587580	5589580	Antoinette, it's easier to blame
5589580	5591580	people than systems. Also,
5591580	5593580	structural analysis is
5593580	5595580	very boring, and destroying people
5595580	5597580	with gossip is extremely entertaining.
5597580	5599580	This obsessive
5599580	5601580	moral policing also gets
5601580	5603580	turned inward and becomes leftist
5603580	5605580	guilt. You know, this useless
5605580	5607580	internalized scolding.
5607580	5609580	I think I'm done with my makeup. What do we
5609580	5611580	think? Leave a comment. I'm always hesitant
5611580	5613580	to do anything about skincare, since last time
5613580	5615580	I did skincare, I was critiqued by Hyram.
5615580	5617580	So I am gonna spray my face a couple
5617580	5619580	times with this Tatcha skin
5619580	5621580	mist, if that's okay with Hyram.
5621580	5623580	It feels good to finally address this
5623580	5625580	feud. Clear the air.
5625580	5627580	I look a lot better with makeup.
5627580	5629580	I don't want to say that I don't have natural beauty,
5629580	5631580	it's just that it's very much enhanced by
5631580	5633580	painting a different face on top of
5633580	5635580	my face. But hey, at least this way
5635580	5637580	I've kind of earned it, you know?
5637580	5639580	Because it's my skill. So there's a podcast
5639580	5641580	called Guilty Feminist that's been
5641580	5643580	running for years. And I haven't listened in a
5643580	5645580	while, but in the early episodes, they'd bring
5645580	5647580	on these women who would confess their
5647580	5649580	feminist sins. You know,
5649580	5651580	hi, my name is Amber,
5651580	5653580	I'm a feminist, but
5653580	5655580	I enjoy being choked
5655580	5657580	in bed. It's
5657580	5659580	hard being a woman. Not only are you being
5659580	5661580	choked, you also feel guilty
5661580	5663580	about it. The same moral hand-wringing
5663580	5665580	happens with body positivity.
5665580	5667580	When you make loving your body into
5667580	5669580	a moral imperative, not
5669580	5671580	only are you still going to hate your body,
5671580	5673580	but now you're also going to feel guilty
5673580	5675580	about hating your body because it makes you a
5675580	5677580	bad feminist. So there was one problem,
5677580	5679580	and now there's two problems.
5679580	5681580	Thanks, morality. That's very
5681580	5683580	helpful. Now I want to take a moment to
5683580	5685580	acknowledge that a lot of conservatives
5685580	5687580	have made some version of the
5687580	5689580	argument I'm making in this video.
5689580	5691580	For example, Jordan Peterson
5691580	5693580	and Camille Paglia have argued
5693580	5695580	that academic postmodernists
5695580	5697580	are motivated by resentment. The argument
5697580	5699580	is that deconstructionist
5699580	5701580	literary theory is a kind of envious
5701580	5703580	vengeance against the beauty
5703580	5705580	and virtuosity of canonical
5705580	5707580	great art. And yeah, there's probably
5707580	5709580	some truth to that. A lot of academics
5709580	5711580	are field artists, but I was even more
5711580	5713580	manqué than that. I've noticed that
5713580	5715580	working-class, non-academic socialists
5715580	5717580	do tend to be more
5717580	5719580	productive and more self-advancing,
5719580	5721580	involved in unionizing or organizing.
5721580	5723580	Whereas, it's usually people who
5723580	5725580	went to college. I went to
5725580	5727580	college!
5727580	5729580	Presumably because they had middle
5729580	5731580	class ambitions at some point,
5731580	5733580	but whose middle-class ambitions have
5733580	5735580	failed. Who become the great
5735580	5737580	critiquers of capital. I mean, I can tell you
5737580	5739580	from experience that when I was eating
5739580	5741580	Chef Boyardee over my master's degree,
5741580	5743580	that's when I was most likely to say things like
5743580	5745580	According to Antonio Gramsci,
5745580	5747580	in the logic of late-stage capitalism,
5747580	5749580	the culturally hegemonic neoliberal
5749580	5751580	ideology manufactures the consent
5751580	5753580	of the civilian.
5753580	5755580	Uh, so point taken. But some conservatives
5755580	5757580	take this argument way too
5757580	5759580	far and try to argue that the entire
5759580	5761580	left is nothing but a coalition
5761580	5763580	of resentment. Like there's a video on YouTube
5763580	5765580	of the philosophy professor Steven
5765580	5767580	Hicks doing a version of the
5767580	5769580	post-modernism is resentment argument,
5769580	5771580	and in the comments section there's a bunch of people
5771580	5773580	saying, this describes Black
5773580	5775580	Lives Matter, Antifa, and
5775580	5777580	the Democrats. Does
5777580	5779580	it though? I mean, any political movement
5779580	5781580	is gonna have people in it who suffer
5781580	5783580	from resentment poisoning. But Black Lives
5783580	5785580	Matter, at its core,
5785580	5787580	is about the right not to be murdered
5787580	5789580	by police. The slogan,
5789580	5791580	Black Lives Matter, is an affirmation
5791580	5793580	of the value of Black life.
5793580	5795580	So, that seems like something even
5795580	5797580	Nietzsche would approve of. Huey Newton,
5797580	5799580	the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,
5799580	5801580	was inspired by Nietzsche to
5801580	5803580	create the slogan, All Power to the People.
5803580	5805580	When we coined the expression
5805580	5807580	All Power to the People, we had in mind
5807580	5809580	emphasizing the word power, for
5809580	5811580	we recognize that the will to power is
5811580	5813580	the basic drive of man. But it is
5813580	5815580	incorrect to seek power over people.
5815580	5817580	We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing
5817580	5819580	power of exploitation and
5819580	5821580	racism for hundreds of years, and
5821580	5823580	the Black community has its will to power
5823580	5825580	also. What we seek, however,
5825580	5827580	is not power over people, but the
5827580	5829580	power of control of our own destiny.
5829580	5831580	That, to me, is a
5831580	5833580	role model for how to do identity politics
5833580	5835580	without centering resentment.
5835580	5837580	It's instead an affirmation of
5837580	5839580	self-determination and self-respect.
5839580	5841580	Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying
5841580	5843580	yes to yourself. Whereas, if your
5843580	5845580	whole political project is defined in the
5845580	5847580	negative, then you're allowing yourself
5847580	5849580	to be defined by your enemies. I find
5849580	5851580	feminism is prone to this, where even
5851580	5853580	and in fact especially the most radical
5853580	5855580	feminists cannot seem to escape
5855580	5857580	this resentful consciousness of being
5857580	5859580	the second sex and defining themselves
5859580	5861580	against men.
5861580	5863580	Earlier I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a
5863580	5865580	positive way. She's the most radical of
5865580	5867580	radical feminists, and my first
5867580	5869580	impulse is actually to defend her
5869580	5871580	because she's very widely hated
5871580	5873580	and most of the people who hate her
5873580	5875580	hate a caricature. Like in that Steven
5875580	5877580	Hicks video, Hicks summarizes
5877580	5878580	Dworkin as,
5879580	5883580	literally in the preface to her most
5883580	5885580	famous book, Dworkin says,
5885580	5887580	If one's sexual experience
5887580	5889580	has always and without exception
5889580	5891580	been based on dominance,
5891580	5893580	how could one understand that this
5893580	5895580	book does not say that all
5895580	5897580	men are rapists or that all intercourse
5897580	5899580	is rape? Listen Hicks,
5899580	5901580	I get that you're a full professor and I'm
5901580	5903580	just a makeup vlogger, but my gut
5903580	5905580	feeling on this one is, before
5905580	5907580	criticizing a book, maybe
5907580	5909580	read the book. Just a thought.
5909580	5911580	Get it together prof. You're being owned
5911580	5913580	online by a makeup vlogger. I mean
5913580	5915580	there's no shame in that, it happens to me all the time.
5915580	5917580	That being said, I do think that Hicks
5917580	5919580	is coincidentally correct
5919580	5921580	that Dworkin is a theorist
5921580	5923580	of resentment. What Dworkin does
5923580	5925580	say in this book is arguably
5925580	5927580	even more bleak than what is falsely
5927580	5929580	attributed to her. The book is called
5929580	5931580	Intercourse. She wrote a book called Intercourse.
5931580	5933580	Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.
5933580	5935580	I can actually easily imagine that, never mind.
5935580	5937580	So this is an argument about the
5937580	5939580	meaning of sex. Penetration
5939580	5941580	to be specific. Dworkin
5941580	5943580	argues that penetration expresses
5943580	5945580	domination, invasion,
5945580	5947580	occupation, possession, contempt,
5947580	5949580	degradation. So it's
5949580	5951580	against the Freudian male
5951580	5953580	castration anxiety interpretation
5953580	5955580	where it's, you know, fear of
5955580	5957580	being devoured by the woman.
5957580	5959580	Imagine being afraid of that. Imagine
5959580	5961580	being afraid of that. I'm gonna get a
5961580	5963580	facelift someday, and I'm
5963580	5965580	gonna look like this.
5965580	5967580	I'm perfect.
5967580	5969580	I certainly don't agree,
5969580	5971580	with everything she says, but isn't
5971580	5973580	Dworkin closer to the truth here? Closer than
5973580	5975580	Freud, anyway. You know, think about what men
5975580	5977580	typically say to women during
5977580	5979580	the act. Do they say,
5979580	5981580	Help, I'm being devoured.
5981580	5983580	Never heard that one. Have you?
5983580	5985580	No, usually it's more along the lines of
5985580	5987580	You like that, don't you?
5987580	5989580	You little... Etc. And of course
5989580	5991580	you can eroticize being subjugated
5991580	5993580	and degraded, and enjoy it.
5993580	5995580	And I think Dworkin would argue that most women
5995580	5997580	do eroticize subjugation because
5997580	5999580	they're taught to. But enjoying it
5999580	6001580	she'd have to say, doesn't
6001580	6003580	change the meaning of what's happening.
6003580	6005580	So I think Dworkin says some things that are
6005580	6007580	very true, and some things that are off the fucking rails.
6007580	6009580	Where she loses me is where she
6009580	6011580	starts getting blackpilled, and this book,
6011580	6013580	this is the feminist blackpill.
6013580	6015580	It is 250 pages of
6015580	6017580	hopeless misery and rage. She
6017580	6019580	says, Male-dominant gender
6019580	6021580	hierarchy seems immune to
6021580	6023580	reform. This may be because
6023580	6025580	intercourse itself is immune
6025580	6027580	to reform. Uh, okay, so
6027580	6029580	women will never be free, and
6029580	6031580	until men stop putting the P in the V.
6031580	6033580	We can dream, Andrea.
6033580	6035580	We can dream! Like
6035580	6037580	most ideology of resentment, this book
6037580	6039580	is totally dismissive of any
6039580	6041580	plausible reforms that might
6041580	6043580	actually improve the situation of women.
6043580	6045580	Instead, preferring to wallow in the
6045580	6047580	endless violence, filth, and
6047580	6049580	objection of it all. I also think it's
6049580	6051580	symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a
6051580	6053580	lesbian, but in that second wave
6053580	6055580	political way. Quoting from
6055580	6057580	the foreword, to Dworkin, it was a
6057580	6059580	badge of rebellion against the patriarch
6059580	6061580	hierarchy. In 30 plus years of knowing
6061580	6063580	her, I've never heard of a single romance
6063580	6065580	with a woman not one. This is not
6065580	6067580	surprising to me from the author of a
6067580	6069580	250 page book about sex
6069580	6071580	that not once pauses to even
6071580	6073580	imagine the possibility of
6073580	6075580	intimacy between women. Because it's not a
6075580	6077580	lesbianism that's about saying yes to
6077580	6079580	women. It's a lesbianism that's about
6079580	6081580	saying no to men. You know, people
6081580	6083580	think that lesbians are the biggest man haters,
6083580	6085580	but I don't think that's true. I think
6085580	6087580	lesbians just don't think
6087580	6089580	about men that much. The only men I
6089580	6091580	think about are Fred Nietzsche and
6091580	6093580	Oedipus the King.
6093580	6095580	It's straight women who are usually the real
6095580	6097580	man haters, because they're stuck with this.
6097580	6099580	And love is closer to hatred
6099580	6101580	than neutrality. So what does Andrea Dworkin
6101580	6103580	actually want? What would she say
6103580	6105580	yes to, if she said yes to anything?
6105580	6107580	Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want,
6107580	6109580	because no one ever told them they could.
6109580	6111580	Romance. That's what Joan
6111580	6113580	Didion said is the real desire of the women's
6113580	6115580	movement. Joan Didion, of course, being
6115580	6117580	not like other girls. Dworkin offers occasional
6117580	6119580	glimpses of a positive desire.
6119580	6121580	Despite all efforts to socialize
6121580	6123580	women to one intercourse, women still
6123580	6125580	want a more diffuse and tender sensuality
6125580	6127580	that involves the whole body in a
6127580	6129580	polymorphous tenderness. That does sound
6129580	6131580	nice. I'm so lonely.
6131580	6133580	I think it's a bit bold to speak
6133580	6135580	for all women, though. Like, there are
6135580	6137580	definitely women out there who, uh,
6137580	6139580	they don't make love. Anastasia,
6139580	6141580	they f***
6141580	6143580	hard. I'm really sleepy, and
6143580	6145580	this bed right behind me just looks
6145580	6147580	so nice. Get in here right now.
6147580	6149580	What if I just go to sleep?
6149580	6151580	And then wake up, and then just record
6151580	6153580	the rest of the video when I wake up. I don't want to do it
6153580	6155580	now. I'll get Pikachu. That'll make this easier.
6155580	6157580	Isn't it better for me to have a friend?
6157580	6159580	Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.
6159580	6161580	Why? Because he's the yellowest.
6161580	6163580	Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.
6163580	6165580	You can't name anything. You can't think of anything.
6165580	6167580	So if diffuse and tender sensuality
6167580	6169580	is what you want, then just
6169580	6171580	say that. Is that what you want, Pikachu?
6171580	6173580	I bet it is.
6173580	6175580	And Dworkin did get married.
6175580	6177580	To a gay man. So I
6177580	6179580	guess she found what she wanted.
6179580	6181580	Lucky.
6181580	6183580	Envying
6183580	6185580	Andrea Dworkin. Is that really what we've
6185580	6187580	sunk to around here? You know, I've been noticing
6187580	6189580	the poison creeping
6189580	6191580	into my mind lately. I know this isn't
6191580	6193580	very original, but I had
6193580	6195580	a bad year. You know, I fell in love with my
6195580	6197580	best friend like a gay idiot,
6197580	6199580	got my heart comprehensively
6199580	6201580	broken, and then COVID hit
6201580	6203580	and gave me a year of solitude
6203580	6205580	to spiral deeper
6205580	6207580	into a hell of my own making.
6207580	6209580	You know, I stopped saying yes to life.
6209580	6211580	And I started saying yes to chasing
6211580	6213580	the dragon. By which I mean
6213580	6215580	playing Spyro the Dragon. One of the
6215580	6217580	greatest appropriate for all ages
6217580	6219580	video games of all time.
6219580	6221580	Look at him gooooooo
6221580	6223580	I'm taking the hair clips out. I catch
6223580	6225580	myself having bitter spinster thoughts.
6225580	6227580	It's because I'm trans.
6227580	6229580	It's because I'm gay. That's
6229580	6231580	why I'll die alone. Yeah, that's the reason
6231580	6233580	I'm alone. Definitely not because I don't
6233580	6235580	leave the house. See, I am not immune
6235580	6237580	to incel-tier
6237580	6239580	brain poisoning. And you really can't
6239580	6241580	use political theorizing as
6241580	6243580	an excuse not to fix your
6243580	6245580	life. Society did
6245580	6247580	this to me. A transphobic
6247580	6249580	society made me hate myself.
6249580	6251580	Well,
6251580	6253580	yeah, that's true.
6253580	6255580	But at a certain point, you have
6255580	6257580	to take responsibility for your own
6257580	6259580	mind, and decide to stop being
6259580	6261580	an accomplice in your own annihilation.
6261580	6263580	Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost,
6263580	6265580	the mind is its own place, and in
6265580	6267580	itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of
6267580	6269580	heaven. Yeah, squad. So I asked
6269580	6271580	myself, what kind of mind
6271580	6273580	do I want to be? Do I want to obsess
6273580	6275580	over what I lack? Concede
6275580	6277580	society's judgment of my inferiority?
6277580	6279580	Become a self-hating, self-pitying,
6279580	6281580	envious, resentful little
6281580	6283580	nothing? Or, do I want
6283580	6285580	to get off the goddamn
6285580	6287580	floor, stop chasing the dragon,
6287580	6289580	and say yes to life?
6289580	6291580	The answer, of course, is that
6291580	6293580	I long to return to the sweet womb
6293580	6295580	of my dark mother. But we're not gonna do
6295580	6297580	that, because there's plenty of time to numb
6297580	6299580	the pain after you die. The sweet
6299580	6301580	embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.
6301580	6303580	Also, nothing is
6303580	6305580	less attractive than an
6305580	6307580	envious, resentful,
6307580	6309580	self-pitying person. It's beyond
6309580	6311580	a personality flaw. It's
6311580	6313580	a personality deformity
6313580	6315580	that can ruin whatever chance at happiness
6315580	6317580	you have. So, in the short
6317580	6319580	time that you're alive, you have to
6319580	6321580	discover that which is noble
6321580	6323580	in yourself, and say yes to it.
6323580	6325580	You know, don't say no to getting older.
6325580	6327580	Say yes to being a MILF.
6327580	6329580	Yes. Yes.
6329580	6331580	What I'm really trying to say here is
6331580	6333580	Spongebob Squarepants is the
6333580	6335580	ubermensch. Spongebob says
6335580	6337580	yes to life, and so should we.
6337580	6339580	Yes to ourselves. Yes to
6339580	6341580	art. Yes to sensuality.
6341580	6343580	Yes to the world. Yes.
6343580	6345580	Yes.
6345580	6347580	We.
6347580	6349580	Is this really how we're ending the video?
6349580	6351580	I guess.
6351580	6353580	Okay, bye!
6359580	6369580	Oh, so what
6369580	6371580	if my fantasies make no sense? You wanna
6371580	6373580	talk about things that don't make sense?
6373580	6375580	Heterosexuality. Let's put that under the microscope,
6375580	6377580	hmm? You want me to believe
6377580	6379580	that a straight woman who knows
6379580	6381580	the difference between magenta and mauve
6381580	6383580	is gonna date a straight man
6383580	6385580	who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear,
6385580	6387580	and that's just gonna work out fine.
6387580	6389580	You think it's safe to raise a child in that
6389580	6391580	environment? I don't think so.
6391580	6393580	Not on my watch.
6393580	6395580	See, I think straight men should date each other.
6395580	6397580	They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox
6397580	6399580	and then each other. And then straight women
6399580	6401580	can pair off, decoupage
6401580	6403580	some shit, and eat each other out.
6403580	6405580	Isn't that better? Isn't that more
6405580	6407580	rational? I wish I could wiggle these cat ears.
6407580	6409580	Like, I wish I had anatomical
6409580	6411580	control over them. Hello?
6411580	6413580	Yes, Dr. Spiegel?
6413580	6415580	Yes, it's me again.
6415580	6417580	I have a suggestion. What do we even have here?
6417580	6419580	We've got tuna, salmon,
6419580	6421580	some squid,
6421580	6423580	mackerel, shrimp,
6423580	6425580	some, I think it's yellowtail,
6425580	6427580	clam,
6427580	6429580	some rolls. I've never been as much into rolls.
6429580	6431580	I'm a cat, you know, I like fish.
6431580	6433580	You start adding too much avocado and rice into things.
6433580	6435580	It's an affront to my
6435580	6437580	feline nature.
6449580	6453580	Yes, I'm sure.
6453580	6455580	To make sure it's not too much,
6455580	6457580	get the phone ready,
6457580	6459580	you find a place where
6459580	6462640	you can actually
6462640	6464640	eat them.
6464640	6479480	Give you some
6479580	6492060	Thank you for watching!
6492060	6495760	Doctor, I think if a breeze comes into the window, I could die.
