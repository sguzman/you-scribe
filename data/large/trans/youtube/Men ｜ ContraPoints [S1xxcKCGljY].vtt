WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.960
Hi boys, it's me again.

00:07.960 --> 00:08.960
Just your average girl.

00:08.960 --> 00:14.160
Look, I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video we're able

00:14.160 --> 00:16.920
to converse as men.

00:16.920 --> 00:21.320
I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between

00:21.320 --> 00:23.160
now and the decline of Rome.

00:23.160 --> 00:24.500
Do you like history boys?

00:24.500 --> 00:25.960
How did Rome fall again?

00:25.960 --> 00:27.800
Was it the gays?

00:27.800 --> 00:29.220
Tell me all about it.

00:29.220 --> 00:34.220
Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side, and men's

00:34.220 --> 00:36.080
rights activists on the other.

00:36.080 --> 00:37.080
Whatever happened to that?

00:37.080 --> 00:42.460
These days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.220
I did want to do the fedora though.

00:44.220 --> 00:48.540
Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora, and I

00:48.540 --> 00:50.460
wanted to put my own little twist on it.

00:50.460 --> 00:56.620
My wardrobe notes for this video say, MRA femme fatale and fedora but make it fashion.

00:56.620 --> 00:57.620
School shooter realness.

00:57.620 --> 00:59.180
I feel like I'm also serving a little…

00:59.180 --> 01:01.140
Oh.

01:01.140 --> 01:03.580
Red-pilled Carmen Sandiego.

01:03.580 --> 01:08.660
In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?

01:08.660 --> 01:16.200
Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.

01:16.200 --> 01:20.500
Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting

01:20.500 --> 01:22.800
in a state of psychological balance?

01:22.800 --> 01:26.140
Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?

01:26.140 --> 01:27.180
I guess yeah, kind of.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.180
You don't see a whole lot of psyllium hustling.

01:28.180 --> 01:29.180
I'm not sure.

01:29.180 --> 01:30.180
I'm not sure.

01:30.180 --> 01:31.180
I'm not sure.

01:31.180 --> 01:32.180
I don't think I'm going to be a big fan of the trans-heterosexual medicine cabinets.

01:32.180 --> 01:33.180
I'm losing my target audience here.

01:33.180 --> 01:36.740
Listen, my dudes, let's just say, I'm kind of worried about you guys.

01:36.740 --> 01:38.760
And I'm not saying I'm any better.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.820
To be clear, I'm not okay either.

01:40.820 --> 01:44.360
There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.

01:44.360 --> 01:47.140
Yeah, that's right, women pee too, okay?

01:47.140 --> 01:48.140
Get over it.

01:48.140 --> 01:52.680
I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I, for one, will

01:52.680 --> 01:56.140
not be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.

01:56.140 --> 01:57.140
Oh.

01:57.140 --> 01:58.140
I'm sorry.

01:58.140 --> 01:59.140
I'm sorry.

01:59.140 --> 02:02.100
You boys, you're very rational, aren't you?

02:02.100 --> 02:04.260
Ugh, I suppose I was too.

02:04.260 --> 02:08.100
I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with,

02:08.100 --> 02:11.140
both as a biological female and as a Pisces moon.

02:11.140 --> 02:13.700
But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men,

02:13.700 --> 02:15.780
Contra Pines, for men,

02:15.780 --> 02:22.740
I started brushing up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.

02:22.740 --> 02:26.340
So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica,

02:26.340 --> 02:28.580
Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,

02:28.580 --> 02:33.060
and of course, the philosophical classic The Rational Male by Royal Caliente.

02:33.060 --> 02:38.900
So my mind is well lubricated and I am ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating,

02:38.900 --> 02:42.420
intellectual… interchange.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.740
Look, I want to play by your rules, okay?

02:44.740 --> 02:47.300
So there will be no emotions in this video.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.420
I will present my arguments in strict, logical form,

02:50.420 --> 02:54.820
relying only on facts, reason, evidence, and deductive proof.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.340
So let's get to it.

02:58.340 --> 03:12.260
Actually, you know what, fuck that, let's listen to house music and do sex shrugs.

03:26.340 --> 03:28.420
I'm pandering to the male gaze.

03:29.460 --> 03:31.780
Oh, and the male's traits.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.620
God, I love attention.

03:33.620 --> 03:34.660
Hey, gorge.

03:34.660 --> 03:36.020
Hey, gorge.

03:36.020 --> 03:38.100
Hey, gorge.

03:38.100 --> 03:38.820
Okay, I'm ready.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.420
Let's crack open a cold one, boys.

03:42.580 --> 03:44.980
My hands are too pretty to open the can.

03:44.980 --> 03:46.820
I need a man to do it for me.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.620
Help!

03:49.620 --> 03:50.020
Fuck it.

03:52.820 --> 03:53.940
Okay, that's super fucking pretty.

03:53.940 --> 03:54.740
Hey, gorge.

03:54.740 --> 03:55.540
Hey, gorge.

03:55.540 --> 03:56.180
Are there any women?

03:56.180 --> 03:57.860
Women still watching this video?

03:57.860 --> 04:01.860
I'm really sorry about all this, unless you're into that sort of thing.

04:01.860 --> 04:03.540
In which case, how very dare.

04:03.540 --> 04:04.980
I'm a good Presbyterian.

04:04.980 --> 04:07.300
And by Presbyterian, I do mean pansexual.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.100
Hey, how are y'all?

04:08.100 --> 04:11.380
Look, the video's about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.

04:12.260 --> 04:13.300
Am I doing this right?

04:13.300 --> 04:14.580
Is this what men like?

04:14.580 --> 04:15.380
Traps.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.580
Straps.

04:16.580 --> 04:18.260
It is a risky look for a girl like me.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.820
When you do a lingerie look, you know you're going to wind up somewhere

04:20.820 --> 04:23.780
on the frankenfurter violet tchotchke didevantese spectrum?

04:23.780 --> 04:25.940
Oh, but you don't know where exactly.

04:26.180 --> 04:28.820
And that is a dangerous game, ladies.

04:28.820 --> 04:33.380
I have to say, though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now.

04:33.380 --> 04:37.620
But, um, that could be because of the drugs.

04:37.620 --> 04:40.580
Look, gentlemen, let's be rational.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.420
And we're fooling around, okay?

04:42.420 --> 04:43.060
Part one.

04:43.940 --> 04:44.420
Oh, wait.

04:45.380 --> 04:46.420
Rational.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.380
Axiom one.

04:47.940 --> 04:49.620
America's next top victim.

04:50.180 --> 04:55.220
I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture.

04:55.220 --> 04:56.100
And I'm not just talking...

04:56.180 --> 04:59.220
about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.

04:59.220 --> 05:00.020
No, bitch.

05:00.020 --> 05:01.460
This goes all the way to the top.

05:01.460 --> 05:04.740
We have white people complaining about reverse racism.

05:04.740 --> 05:11.220
We have the literal 1% complaining about ANTI-RAGE PREJUDICE.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.900
That must be super fucking hard for you.

05:14.900 --> 05:19.060
We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.

05:19.060 --> 05:23.700
You know, flaunting their sexuality in the faces of children who are trying to raise a family,

05:23.700 --> 05:25.780
and protesting in the street like a bunch of .

05:26.180 --> 05:30.580
And so, of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights too.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.220
I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life,

05:33.220 --> 05:35.380
and I've always been very skeptical.

05:35.380 --> 05:40.500
Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.

05:40.500 --> 05:43.620
Women try to do a good thing to solve a real problem,

05:43.620 --> 05:45.460
and then a man shows up to say,

05:45.460 --> 05:47.060
Well, what about men?

05:47.060 --> 05:48.580
Men also get harassed.

05:48.580 --> 05:50.580
Why aren't you talking about men?

05:50.580 --> 05:55.220
And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?

05:55.220 --> 05:57.380
Of course he's fucking not.

05:57.380 --> 05:58.900
He doesn't give a shit.

05:58.900 --> 06:00.100
He's a troll.

06:00.100 --> 06:05.140
His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?

06:05.140 --> 06:06.340
What about them, honey?

06:06.340 --> 06:09.220
For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once.

06:09.220 --> 06:13.380
And the first thing I did was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement,

06:13.380 --> 06:16.020
which is the Myth of Male Power by Warren Farrell.

06:16.020 --> 06:20.260
Actually, I listened to the audiobook because, let's be honest, reading is hard.

06:20.260 --> 06:24.900
But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it to.

06:25.220 --> 06:30.100
Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender role

06:30.100 --> 06:32.260
that confined women to domestic servitude.

06:32.260 --> 06:37.940
But he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society is actually an illusion,

06:37.940 --> 06:41.620
because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.

06:41.620 --> 06:44.420
He introduces the idea of male disposability,

06:44.420 --> 06:49.300
basically the idea that society values female lives more than male lives,

06:49.300 --> 06:54.180
which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting and providing for women and children.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.140
And he points to statistics,

06:55.140 --> 06:58.420
showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,

06:58.420 --> 07:01.780
workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.

07:01.780 --> 07:07.220
So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power than women,

07:07.220 --> 07:10.980
in fact, the queens have a certain kind of privilege

07:10.980 --> 07:15.860
in being protected and provided for by the expendable male worker bees.

07:15.860 --> 07:18.180
And I guess that kind of makes sense.

07:18.180 --> 07:21.060
I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.

07:21.060 --> 07:23.860
What I'm saying is, I took the red pill,

07:23.860 --> 07:25.060
and I rubbed it on my clitoris,

07:25.060 --> 07:26.020
and I rubbed it on my chest,

07:26.020 --> 07:27.060
and I rubbed it on my chest, and I rubbed it on my chest,

07:27.060 --> 07:27.620
and I rubbed it on my chest, and I rubbed it on my chest,

07:27.620 --> 07:30.260
but some initial objections come to mind.

07:30.260 --> 07:35.140
Like, haven't men been almost all of the kings, presidents, and CEOs for millennia?

07:35.140 --> 07:37.700
Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?

07:37.700 --> 07:38.740
I don't know, boys.

07:38.740 --> 07:41.300
Still seems kind of patriarchal to me.

07:41.300 --> 07:46.980
But maybe you'll say that it's only at the top of society that men have more power than women.

07:46.980 --> 07:53.140
Maybe the average man is also oppressed by the system that feminists call patriarchy.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.420
If that's what you're saying,

07:55.060 --> 07:57.620
I think I basically agree with that.

07:57.620 --> 08:02.100
See, what you have to understand about me is I am such a fucking Libra.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.740
Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,

08:04.740 --> 08:08.580
well, maybe everybody's right, and maybe there's good points on both sides,

08:08.580 --> 08:13.620
and we should all just listen to each other and rub each other's cluuuuts.

08:13.620 --> 08:17.140
But no, my Scorpio rising persona will not allow that.

08:17.140 --> 08:19.300
Oh, there will be a champion.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.660
There will be blood.

08:20.660 --> 08:22.740
So, judges.

08:22.740 --> 08:24.900
How do we decide which gender is American?

08:24.900 --> 08:26.900
And who's America's next top victim?

08:26.900 --> 08:32.260
I mean, it's not like you can just change genders and see how the other half lives.

08:32.260 --> 08:34.180
Or can you?

08:34.180 --> 08:35.700
Proposition two.

08:35.700 --> 08:38.340
Diary of an X-man.

08:38.340 --> 08:45.620
Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.580
Mom, get out of my room.

08:48.580 --> 08:50.020
You're ruining my life.

08:50.020 --> 08:54.500
Look, I have never, ever talked about this on my channel before.

08:54.900 --> 08:57.300
It's like a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.

08:57.300 --> 08:59.220
But I was born a boy.

08:59.220 --> 09:02.180
Well, was I ever really a boy?

09:02.180 --> 09:03.300
It's hard to say.

09:03.300 --> 09:04.580
Dear diary,

09:04.580 --> 09:09.700
Growing up, I always knew that I was different from other kids, especially other boys.

09:09.700 --> 09:12.900
And it took me so long to pinpoint what it was.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.780
But there was this moment.

09:15.780 --> 09:18.580
I must have been, what, seven, eight years old?

09:18.580 --> 09:21.620
And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.020
And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

09:24.020 --> 09:24.500
And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

09:24.500 --> 09:24.820
And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

09:24.820 --> 09:25.700
And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.

09:25.700 --> 09:27.380
And I don't know what it was.

09:27.380 --> 09:30.740
It was like this magnetism that drew me to them.

09:30.740 --> 09:34.260
And I put my little feet in them and walked in front of the mirror.

09:34.260 --> 09:38.420
And I didn't really have the words yet to describe how I felt.

09:38.420 --> 09:43.700
But basically, in that moment, I sensed that God had made a mistake.

09:43.700 --> 09:48.740
And I was destined to be, to be a Crosstresser.

09:51.060 --> 09:53.300
That is super fucking coconuts.

09:53.300 --> 09:54.420
Anyway, then in my 20s, my life completely changed.

09:54.420 --> 09:56.740
My life completely fell apart and I became a woman.

09:56.740 --> 09:57.700
Hey, how are you?

09:57.700 --> 09:59.700
I became one of the dolls.

09:59.700 --> 10:01.380
My plastic surgeon is an artist.

10:01.380 --> 10:05.860
Look, boys, the point I'm trying to make here is I used to live your lifestyle.

10:05.860 --> 10:07.380
I know what people like you get up to.

10:07.380 --> 10:09.140
And I think it's disgusting.

10:09.140 --> 10:13.300
I gotta say, though, since I transitioned, my life has been super fucking great.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.580
Like, way better.

10:14.580 --> 10:18.660
Now, of course, a lot of that is not because women have it better than men, but because...

10:18.660 --> 10:22.420
Hey, gorge, I am literally transgendered.

10:22.900 --> 10:24.020
So before I transitioned, I was like, oh my god.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.620
I was dying inside, you know?

10:25.620 --> 10:27.220
I was in the wrong body.

10:27.220 --> 10:32.500
And now, it's like I finally have the body I was meant to die inside of.

10:32.500 --> 10:33.860
But it's not just that.

10:33.860 --> 10:37.620
I do think that, in some ways, since I started presenting as a woman,

10:37.620 --> 10:39.620
people actually do treat me better.

10:39.620 --> 10:42.260
I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.980
But that's probably for the best.

10:44.980 --> 10:48.260
Now, before using my personal experience as any kind of evidence,

10:48.260 --> 10:50.260
I guess I should say a couple caveats.

10:50.260 --> 10:54.020
Caveat one is that most pre-transition trans women are gay.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.700
They're not like other boys.

10:55.700 --> 11:00.100
And most of us, we're not living the business-class male experience by any means.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.340
You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics,

11:02.340 --> 11:05.860
tormented sissies, secretive transvestites,

11:05.860 --> 11:09.700
poets, you know, that sort of thing.

11:09.700 --> 11:15.140
Caveat two is that my trans experience is not THE trans experience.

11:15.140 --> 11:19.380
And I do have a lot of other privileges that made things go super fucking well for me.

11:19.380 --> 11:20.340
Hey, how are yo?

11:20.340 --> 11:23.300
Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege in a way that's actually...

11:23.300 --> 11:25.460
It's actually just bragging.

11:25.460 --> 11:29.460
You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge that I've been so successful

11:29.460 --> 11:34.820
and I've come so far in part because I'm white and I'm skinny and I'm young

11:34.820 --> 11:40.340
and I'm blonde and I'm rich and I pass and I'm educated and I'm popular

11:40.340 --> 11:44.340
and my plastic surgeon is an artist and my boyfriend is really rich and hot

11:44.340 --> 11:46.500
and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.

11:46.500 --> 11:49.700
And part of what makes me so enlightened and so compassionate

11:49.700 --> 11:53.060
is that I'm able to recognize these privileges that I have

11:53.060 --> 11:58.180
that just might not be available to people who are less fortunate.

11:58.180 --> 12:00.660
From the bottom of my mother-fucking-at-my-father-fucking-heart

12:00.660 --> 12:04.260
that must be super fucking hard for you, I can't even imagine.

12:04.260 --> 12:07.380
What I was saying is there are ways that people treat me better now

12:07.380 --> 12:08.820
that I'm presenting as a woman.

12:08.820 --> 12:10.580
You know, people smile at me more.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.580
I feel more taken care of.

12:12.580 --> 12:14.500
Men do things for me.

12:14.500 --> 12:17.380
Now, a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,

12:17.380 --> 12:20.020
you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,

12:20.020 --> 12:22.820
because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.660
But not me.

12:24.660 --> 12:25.860
I love it.

12:25.860 --> 12:29.860
Both because I love attention and because I'm a recumbent queen

12:29.860 --> 12:32.100
who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.420
I do this thing on airplanes where when it's time for me

12:34.420 --> 12:36.900
to put my carry-on luggage in the overhead bin,

12:36.900 --> 12:40.100
I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift

12:40.100 --> 12:43.220
and then some man will usually get up and do it for me

12:43.220 --> 12:45.220
even though I'm taller than most men.

12:45.220 --> 12:46.420
It makes me happy.

12:46.420 --> 12:48.340
Another good thing about becoming a woman is

12:48.340 --> 12:50.820
I integrated into female social groups

12:50.820 --> 12:52.820
and I found that they provide a kind of

12:52.820 --> 12:55.460
communal support and overt affection

12:55.460 --> 12:58.420
that male social groups generally just don't.

12:58.420 --> 13:01.700
I find that female social style suits me better than the male one

13:01.700 --> 13:04.740
which tends to be more atomized, more individualist

13:04.740 --> 13:09.860
where affection is always concealed behind this semi-jokey front of competition.

13:09.860 --> 13:13.540
Like, think about the way boys talk to each other when they play video games.

13:13.540 --> 13:15.300
A third improvement for me has to do with the way

13:15.300 --> 13:17.780
men and women are treated in public space.

13:17.780 --> 13:19.620
When you present female in public

13:19.620 --> 13:21.220
you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle to be caught up in, so to speak, when you're screened as a zombie.

13:21.220 --> 13:21.720
When you present a female in public, you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle, to be caught up in, and more often than not, an idol in front of a mirror.

13:21.720 --> 13:27.980
spectacle to be commented upon. People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions about

13:27.980 --> 13:34.060
you. Sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting, sometimes just fucking weird. Whereas, when

13:34.060 --> 13:39.040
you present male in public, you're more likely to be treated either as invisible or as dangerous.

13:39.620 --> 13:43.960
Now, feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences as men asserting dominance

13:43.960 --> 13:49.000
over women in public space, and they've criticized catcalling as being objectifying, degrading,

13:49.000 --> 13:53.640
and misogynistic. And it certainly can be all of those things. There's different kinds of

13:53.640 --> 13:58.280
catcalling, and I have different feelings about them. If I'm walking with another woman, and a

13:58.280 --> 14:04.340
man says, ladies, you look beautiful tonight. I don't know. I like that. I think that's nice.

14:04.620 --> 14:10.420
It makes me feel seen. It makes me feel admired. It boosts my confidence. Whereas, if I'm walking

14:10.420 --> 14:16.980
alone, and a drunk starts following me down the street, singing, have you seen a polythene Pam?

14:17.160 --> 14:18.960
She's so good looking, what she looks like.

14:19.000 --> 14:19.560
A man.

14:20.700 --> 14:25.400
That, I am less enthusiastic about. I mean, not that that's ever happened.

14:26.060 --> 14:28.300
I'm completely fucking unclockable, hey, how are you?

14:28.860 --> 14:34.120
No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.

14:34.980 --> 14:39.140
I definitely get where feminists are coming from, because street harassment sucks. I'm a lot more

14:39.140 --> 14:44.260
afraid walking alone at night than I used to be, and there's a lot more places I just won't go by

14:44.260 --> 14:48.980
myself. But on the other hand, I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night,

14:49.000 --> 14:54.880
without other people acting afraid of me. I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine the ways

14:54.880 --> 15:01.540
that being treated as invisible or dangerous can also kind of suck. In my video on incels,

15:01.540 --> 15:07.480
I talked about male invisibility on dating apps, and how getting no attention at all can actually

15:07.480 --> 15:12.160
be emotionally worse than getting a lot of shitty attention. And when it comes to being treated as

15:12.160 --> 15:18.820
dangerous, when I was living as a man, sometimes if I was walking at night, a woman on the same

15:18.820 --> 15:25.060
block as me would change sides of the street. And I totally get why. Men do scary shit sometimes,

15:25.060 --> 15:31.540
and it's better to be safe. But it's still stung a little bit to be treated as dangerous by default.

15:31.540 --> 15:36.820
I think it can actually be harmful, which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation. There's

15:36.820 --> 15:41.920
ways that white women's fear can actually be dangerous, in particular to black men.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.640
I had an experience with this recently when I was filming my video The Apocalypse,

15:45.640 --> 15:48.760
and I had rented a room in a hotel casino. Around midnight,

15:48.760 --> 15:52.960
I was carrying some camera equipment up to my room, and I got into the elevator with a group

15:52.960 --> 15:58.060
of people from the casino floor. A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator except for me,

15:58.060 --> 16:03.520
and a single black man. Well, I mean, he was alone. I don't know if he was single. That's

16:03.520 --> 16:07.720
not part of the story. And as soon as the door closed, he started literally whistling Row,

16:07.720 --> 16:12.460
Row, Row Your Boat, the official melody of performative innocence. And I realized,

16:12.460 --> 16:18.580
oh shit, he's afraid that I'm afraid. And I found that just excruciating. I was like,

16:18.760 --> 16:25.240
oh god, how do other white women behave in elevators? Do they, like, clutch their purses?

16:26.380 --> 16:32.200
Ugh, that's so foggy embarrassing. Nothing like that had ever happened to me when I was living

16:32.200 --> 16:37.360
as a man. It's not a thing between black men and white men. It's a thing between black men

16:37.360 --> 16:42.580
and white women. And so that dynamic was there, not just because I'm white and he's black, but

16:42.580 --> 16:47.560
because I'm a woman and he's a man. And I thought of that incident again when I was listening to

16:48.760 --> 16:54.340
it. And Farrell says, men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength, and women's greatest

16:54.340 --> 16:59.440
strength is their facade of weakness. I think there is some truth to the idea that women's

16:59.440 --> 17:04.840
perceived vulnerability can make them powerful, and men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.

17:04.840 --> 17:08.560
Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt, because these are just some little

17:08.560 --> 17:14.140
observations I've made based on a handful of anecdotes. And as rational males, it's important

17:14.140 --> 17:18.380
that we consider the facts, the stats, and the figures. Did you know?

17:18.380 --> 17:26.960
Did you know that 46% of men are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women? Look it up.

17:26.960 --> 17:33.320
I haven't. I guess my super fucking Libra opinion is that there's upsides and downsides to male and

17:33.320 --> 17:38.000
female experience. I don't actually think there's a single definite answer to the vague and useless

17:38.000 --> 17:43.400
question, which gender has it worse? I consider myself a feminist because I support reproductive

17:43.400 --> 17:48.320
rights and I oppose workplace misogyny, and I generally agree with a lot of the activism that

17:48.380 --> 17:52.340
happens under the heading of feminism. But I also think a lot of men are just

17:52.340 --> 17:56.360
having a super fucking difficult time right now, and that must be super fucking hard for them,

17:56.360 --> 18:00.800
eh? How are you? And I don't think feminists have an obligation to care about male angst,

18:00.800 --> 18:06.320
but I care about you boys. God, I'm such a cool girl, I think the entire mid-Atlantic

18:06.320 --> 18:10.460
region is about to freeze over. No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon,

18:10.460 --> 18:18.260
and I really try to understand other people's pain, because I just find it really, really funny.

18:18.380 --> 18:25.640
I'm also really, really sobering up here. The drugs have worn off, and I'm suddenly feeling

18:25.640 --> 18:32.420
very naked. Like, it's just now occurring to me that this is a highly inappropriate outfit for

18:32.420 --> 18:38.240
this occasion. So, I'm gonna go put on a robe, and I'll meet you back for the next section.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.840
Postulate 3. The Man Question.

18:47.660 --> 18:48.320
Hi boys.

18:48.380 --> 18:49.520
Et cetera, et cetera.

18:49.520 --> 18:51.080
Hey, how are you?

18:51.080 --> 18:57.140
For the last three years on this channel, I have been your Virgil, leading you through gender hell.

18:57.140 --> 19:03.560
Pick-up artists, gender dysphoria, incels, radical feminists, non-binary genders,

19:03.560 --> 19:09.200
men's rights activists. It seems like everybody's having gender trouble, so what do we make of that?

19:09.200 --> 19:16.760
Well, Gorg, a very, very rational male philosopher named Hegel once said that the unfolding of

19:16.760 --> 19:17.660
history is a

19:17.660 --> 19:23.480
basically rational process, Gorg. That means that at any time in history, society is based

19:23.480 --> 19:29.280
on certain principles, like, um, all men are created equal as long as they're super fucking

19:29.280 --> 19:34.680
rich and white. And there's always contradictions within those principles, which creates tension

19:34.680 --> 19:39.400
and eventually leads to a rupture, like a revolution, where society has to be reorganized

19:39.400 --> 19:43.480
according to new principles. At least, I think he was saying something like that. It's pretty

19:43.480 --> 19:46.800
hard to make anything out through the fog of his unreadable, hyper-abstract man-jabbing.

19:46.800 --> 19:53.220
God, I can't stand that shit. Or any of the other music-hating vol-cells of the male philosophical

19:53.220 --> 19:57.460
tradition. My point is, I think our society has reached a place where gender as we know

19:57.460 --> 20:01.920
it just isn't working anymore. Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working or how

20:01.920 --> 20:06.920
to fix it, but we do all agree that it's broken. We have mainstream feminists saying we need

20:06.920 --> 20:10.680
to continue advancing the rights of women. We have conservatives saying we need to restore

20:10.680 --> 20:14.860
the gender roles of the 1950s. We have an increasing number of people not identifying

20:14.860 --> 20:16.660
as men or women. We have TERFs saying we need to restore the gender roles of women. We have

20:16.660 --> 20:19.980
transphobic TERFs who think that the transgenders are the single greatest threat to civilization,

20:19.980 --> 20:24.080
hey, how are you? And we have men's rights activists saying we need a male equivalent

20:24.080 --> 20:28.880
to feminism to liberate men from their oppressive gender role. Now, I want to focus on that

20:28.880 --> 20:34.620
last one, because in principle, I agree. I've spent a lot of the last three years covering

20:34.620 --> 20:38.960
the manosphere. I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me. And from all the time I've

20:38.960 --> 20:44.900
tortured myself wading through these communities of incels, pick-up artists, men's rights slacktivists,

20:44.900 --> 20:45.900
intellectual dark web fanboys, and anti-feminism activists, I've come to the conclusion that

20:45.900 --> 20:46.420
I'm not the only one who thinks that the transgenders are the single greatest threat to civilization,

20:46.420 --> 20:46.520
hey, how are you? And we have men's rights activists saying we need a male equivalent to feminism to liberate

20:46.520 --> 20:49.080
men from their oppressive gender role. Now, I've spent a lot of the last three years On

20:49.080 --> 20:53.780
the same planet world, somewhere in our own lives, some of those healthy species have

20:53.780 --> 20:58.880
nothing to do with us or anything else, and all of our vakas and 1000s of racisms have

20:58.880 --> 21:00.640
nothing to do with that mother24 and the others, but happens to be a lie to me. Yeah,

21:00.640 --> 21:02.440
morph forests, freaking you guys and shit, bullshit. Yeah. But to at least identify who

21:02.440 --> 21:03.700
long, crossedació this great opportunity of our funky moments because,

21:03.700 --> 21:07.080
it all starts from up here, says Mike. And you lie to me, you mean七

21:07.080 --> 21:09.440
And just to clarify, I'm not trying to take away your video games and pornography,

21:09.440 --> 21:12.260
but I am not telling you what to do with your penis, you can rub one out once in a while

21:12.260 --> 21:13.220
for this video for all I care–let's just move on.

21:13.220 --> 21:14.220
ok?

21:14.220 --> 21:16.280
Don't pull a GamerKeed on me, okay?

21:17.740 --> 21:19.020
I live in fear.

21:19.020 --> 21:21.500
Look, I like to believe that until the red pillars

21:21.500 --> 21:25.280
inject their poison, most of these boys are not bad people.

21:25.280 --> 21:28.080
I think all of this originates in a genuine crisis

21:28.080 --> 21:30.240
of male identity, and I think it's happened

21:30.240 --> 21:33.300
in something like the way men's rights activists describe.

21:33.300 --> 21:35.820
The sacrificial role of men as warriors

21:35.820 --> 21:38.280
is no longer widely glorified or necessary.

21:38.280 --> 21:40.640
The traditional protector-provider role of men

21:40.640 --> 21:42.820
is being replaced by a more equal

21:42.820 --> 21:44.720
and undefined gender dynamic.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.300
And college professors and activists are telling men

21:47.300 --> 21:50.220
that most of our culture's aspirational representations

21:50.220 --> 21:52.320
of manhood are toxic and bad.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.400
But without an attractive replacement vision

21:54.400 --> 21:57.420
of aspirational manhood, average young men

21:57.420 --> 22:00.940
can only envision their future as what?

22:00.940 --> 22:04.820
The beta, the cock, the new male.

22:04.820 --> 22:06.340
And in a post-left-toop internet,

22:06.340 --> 22:08.880
we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.540
And to be fair, it is very funny.

22:11.540 --> 22:12.420
But we forget,

22:12.420 --> 22:14.920
especially us grills, that for a lot of men,

22:14.920 --> 22:18.820
these words actually do tap into a deep existential angst.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.200
And a lot of leftists go,

22:20.200 --> 22:22.200
well, how can men be so angsty?

22:22.200 --> 22:24.900
Especially white men, they're so privileged.

22:24.900 --> 22:28.740
But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.

22:28.740 --> 22:31.740
If you're actually being oppressed, you have a struggle,

22:31.740 --> 22:35.220
you have something to fight for, and therefore, a purpose.

22:35.220 --> 22:37.740
But for a lot of men, their lack of purpose

22:37.740 --> 22:40.020
puts them in search of a struggle.

22:40.020 --> 22:42.320
And that, along with the loneliness

22:42.320 --> 22:44.420
and the lack of a positive identity,

22:44.420 --> 22:46.680
is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment

22:46.680 --> 22:49.060
by the manosphere groups and by the alt-right.

22:49.060 --> 22:52.000
And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor

22:52.000 --> 22:54.540
for the small but growing number of young men

22:54.540 --> 22:56.200
who decide to pick up a gun

22:56.200 --> 22:58.340
and open fire in a shopping center.

22:58.340 --> 23:00.240
There were two mass shootings during the weekend

23:00.240 --> 23:03.540
I was writing this video, resulting in 31 deaths.

23:03.540 --> 23:05.240
Both shooters were young white men,

23:05.240 --> 23:07.440
and one of them posted about the shooting

23:07.440 --> 23:08.820
on an alt-right image board.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.200
Now, I don't pretend to fully understand

23:10.200 --> 23:11.200
the motives of mass shooters, but I don't think it's true.

23:11.200 --> 23:12.200
I don't think it's true.

23:12.200 --> 23:13.600
I don't think it's a coincidence

23:13.600 --> 23:15.540
that basically all of them are men.

23:15.540 --> 23:18.620
One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic

23:18.620 --> 23:21.200
is that these killers are trying to resurrect

23:21.200 --> 23:24.420
some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory,

23:24.420 --> 23:28.400
and therefore, to be seen and recognized as men

23:28.400 --> 23:31.880
by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.600
And of course, there's also the racism

23:33.600 --> 23:34.960
of the alt-right killers,

23:34.960 --> 23:37.980
and the wounded sexual entitlement of the incel killers.

23:37.980 --> 23:41.540
But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,

23:41.540 --> 23:44.020
and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis

23:44.020 --> 23:45.920
are more receptive to learning it.

23:45.920 --> 23:48.360
So, you can try to take down their forums,

23:48.360 --> 23:51.420
and ban their accounts, and de-platform their events,

23:51.420 --> 23:55.300
but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,

23:55.300 --> 23:58.000
I don't see any end to these problems.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.360
Theorem four, what do?

24:00.360 --> 24:03.160
There is this media narrative that has emerged

24:03.160 --> 24:05.120
around me and around this channel.

24:05.120 --> 24:07.220
And by the way, the fact that there's any kind

24:07.220 --> 24:09.120
of media narrative about this channel

24:09.120 --> 24:11.420
is super fucking coconuts.

24:11.420 --> 24:13.140
Because let's be real, Gorge,

24:13.140 --> 24:14.920
I just wanted to pour milk on my face

24:14.920 --> 24:16.260
and talk about the mouthfeel.

24:16.260 --> 24:18.300
But there's this media narrative that my role

24:18.300 --> 24:23.300
in the discourse is de-radicalizing young alt-right men.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.180
And it's true that if you read

24:26.180 --> 24:28.480
the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,

24:28.480 --> 24:30.860
I used to be alt-right posts are so common

24:30.860 --> 24:32.300
they're considered cliche.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.700
And some of them cite me as an influence

24:34.700 --> 24:38.020
in changing their politics, which I love for them,

24:38.020 --> 24:40.940
and I'm super fucking happy about it, but it's also,

24:40.940 --> 24:43.620
um, a lot of responsibility.

24:43.620 --> 24:48.140
They're my boys, and I worry about my boys.

24:48.140 --> 24:50.040
Because in reality, it's not like they go

24:50.040 --> 24:52.820
from far right extremists to complacent centrists.

24:52.820 --> 24:55.100
No, most of them go far left.

24:55.100 --> 24:57.780
A lot of them become communists or anarchists.

24:57.780 --> 24:59.700
So I watch them go from far to my right

24:59.700 --> 25:01.780
to significantly to my left.

25:01.780 --> 25:04.920
It's not really de-radicalizing so much as re-radicalizing.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.900
And I think it's definitely an improvement,

25:06.900 --> 25:09.560
but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.

25:09.560 --> 25:12.780
I worry about my boys because I don't think

25:12.780 --> 25:16.540
that the left yet has a final solution to the man question.

25:16.540 --> 25:19.120
Oh no, that was worded poorly.

25:19.120 --> 25:21.080
You know, there's kind of two options the left has

25:21.080 --> 25:22.340
for disillusioned men.

25:22.340 --> 25:25.800
The first is the Marxist promise of economic revolution.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.620
We say, well, actually, yes, you are oppressed,

25:28.620 --> 25:31.620
but you're oppressed because of your class, not your gender.

25:31.620 --> 25:32.860
So just join the revolution.

25:32.860 --> 25:34.820
It's gonna be super fucking crazy.

25:34.820 --> 25:37.360
We're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie, meow, meow.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.280
Smash, no voting.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.560
And then things will be better for you.

25:41.560 --> 25:44.180
Now, I think that has a couple limitations.

25:44.180 --> 25:46.880
One is that I look at the far left

25:46.880 --> 25:49.580
and I see a bunch of people who spend all their time

25:49.580 --> 25:52.200
accusing each other of abusing moderator privileges

25:52.200 --> 25:53.680
in closed Facebook groups.

25:53.680 --> 25:57.700
And I'm concerned that might not succeed

25:57.700 --> 26:00.040
at ending capitalism, meow, meow.

26:00.040 --> 26:01.940
Like definitely vote for Bernie Sanders

26:01.940 --> 26:03.440
or Elizabeth Warren or whoever.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.060
But if you're investing all of your hopes

26:06.060 --> 26:09.260
in a capital R revolution, I worry that can be

26:09.280 --> 26:12.520
become like waiting for Godot or waiting for the rapture.

26:12.520 --> 26:14.140
So we do need political change,

26:14.140 --> 26:18.080
but I feel like I'm failing my boys

26:18.080 --> 26:19.700
if I'm somehow giving them the idea

26:19.700 --> 26:21.920
that revolution is their only hope.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.220
Cause here's the other thing,

26:23.220 --> 26:25.920
even if we did succeed ending capitalism,

26:25.920 --> 26:27.140
there would still be gender.

26:27.140 --> 26:30.260
And my boys would still need some model

26:30.260 --> 26:33.480
of what it is to lead a good life as a man.

26:33.480 --> 26:36.140
Now the other option the left has for disillusioned men

26:36.140 --> 26:38.340
is the feminist tranquilizer.

26:38.340 --> 26:38.620
We say, look, talk about how it's not about how you live.

26:38.620 --> 26:39.220
This is the feminist tranquilizer.

26:39.220 --> 26:43.560
Toxic masculinity is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings and it's the reason

26:43.560 --> 26:47.920
you feel lonely and inadequate. So while feminism tells women you hate your body and you're

26:47.920 --> 26:53.540
constantly doubting yourself because society did this to you and needs to change, we kind of just

26:53.540 --> 26:59.180
tell men you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic. Stop it. We tell them they're broken without

26:59.180 --> 27:05.900
really telling them how to fix themselves. I think what we need is a new positive ideal of manhood

27:05.900 --> 27:10.820
which I don't think is something that women can create for men even if they wanted to. And honestly

27:10.820 --> 27:15.440
the best way for that to happen may actually be some kind of men's movement. But on the left the

27:15.440 --> 27:21.360
whole idea of a men's movement is basically taboo because the men's movement we all know is basically

27:21.360 --> 27:27.820
just a backlash to feminism and at worst it's just straight up misogyny. And look boys, I understand

27:27.820 --> 27:33.160
that being lectured about man spreading for most of 2015 was super fucking hard for you and you're

27:33.160 --> 27:35.880
still mad about it but posting endless

27:35.880 --> 27:41.360
outrage porn about false rape accusations and paternity fraud isn't actually going to make life

27:41.360 --> 27:46.920
any better for you. Because yes, those things are horrible when they happen but they're not systemic

27:46.920 --> 27:53.200
issues that affect most men. I think what would actually improve life for most men is a positive

27:53.200 --> 27:59.780
ideal of 21st century manhood but that's not something I can give to you because in case you

27:59.780 --> 28:04.800
hadn't noticed I'm literally a fucking woman. I can't mom you through this one boys, you're on

28:04.800 --> 28:05.260
your own.

28:05.880 --> 28:16.920
You don't have to help each other. So find each other in the comments section, meet up on reddit, make friends, clean your room, leave the house, fuck each other, I don't know, it's worth a try.

28:16.920 --> 28:24.600
And failing that, you could always throw in the towel and become a woman. Worked for me.

28:35.880 --> 28:46.920
I'll see you in the next one.

28:46.920 --> 28:50.920
Bye.

for their labor and women are useful for their wombs well i'm a woman without a womb so i guess

29:41.560 --> 29:47.800
i'm useless but i'm beautifully useless oh i'm a work of art the problem with our society is we've

29:47.800 --> 29:55.400
turned men into women it's disgusting as an ally to men it's not my place to speak for them or speak

29:55.400 --> 30:04.280
over them but i just want to use my platform to uplift some male voices who might not have as

30:04.280 --> 30:16.680
many subscribers as me okay i'm not hypergamous i don't need a rich husband if i make what share

30:16.680 --> 30:22.120
i don't need a rich man i am a rich man it's not even really much of an insult being called

30:22.120 --> 30:32.440
a delusional man many great books have been written by delusional men so bad i'm bad i'm

30:32.440 --> 30:33.000
