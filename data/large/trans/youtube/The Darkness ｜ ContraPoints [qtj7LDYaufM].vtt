00:00.000 --> 00:29.980
Thank you for watching.

00:30.000 --> 00:59.980
I'll see you in the next one.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.540
It's probably the most effective approach eventually,

01:03.400 --> 01:05.140
but the problem is that it's hard

01:05.140 --> 01:07.280
and I don't like things that are hard.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.380
Because when you do things that are hard,

01:11.540 --> 01:14.960
you have to feel bad now so that you can feel good later.

01:15.360 --> 01:16.820
And I don't want to feel good later.

01:17.140 --> 01:18.680
I want to feel good now.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.320
And if you want to feel good now,

01:20.520 --> 01:22.260
well, you have a couple options.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.980
The first is, of course, to do drugs.

01:25.160 --> 01:26.060
And I've tried that.

01:26.340 --> 01:29.320
I spent most of my 20s on the threshold of alcoholism,

01:29.320 --> 01:31.700
but it turns out that's not a cute look for me.

01:31.800 --> 01:32.680
It's not my vibe.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.600
So what I do now when I feel the darkness coming

01:35.600 --> 01:38.200
is what any respectable woman would do.

01:38.600 --> 01:42.260
I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.

01:42.520 --> 01:44.920
Is it a pee under my mattress, your majesty?

01:45.220 --> 01:48.120
Or is it another Xanax I left under the throat rug?

01:48.300 --> 01:49.520
Now, the problem with doing drugs

01:49.520 --> 01:52.460
is that when the drugs wear off, you feel bad again.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.140
In fact, you probably feel worse.

01:55.380 --> 01:56.800
So where do we go from here?

01:57.220 --> 01:59.220
Well, how about music?

01:59.320 --> 02:02.280
When you feel bad, you want to listen to sad music

02:02.280 --> 02:04.920
because sad music makes you cry.

02:05.320 --> 02:07.460
And crying feels good.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.280
It's like an orgasm for sad people.

02:10.540 --> 02:13.600
And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness?

02:14.060 --> 02:16.540
The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.620
You know, I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax

02:19.620 --> 02:20.840
under this throat rug.

02:21.540 --> 02:23.820
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.040
But in the memes, you only hear the first 10 seconds of the song.

02:28.040 --> 02:28.960
You only hear,

02:29.320 --> 02:30.820
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

02:30.820 --> 02:33.440
And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song,

02:33.440 --> 02:34.480
which is good,

02:34.480 --> 02:36.800
because if you're making songs for sad people,

02:36.800 --> 02:40.740
it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.

02:40.740 --> 02:43.880
Because sad people don't like happy songs.

02:43.880 --> 02:45.100
When you're sad,

02:45.100 --> 02:48.820
happy songs make you feel like you're being bullshitted.

02:48.820 --> 02:50.580
So we're 10 seconds into the song,

02:50.580 --> 02:52.260
Hello, darkness, my old friend.

02:52.260 --> 02:56.060
The key is D sharp minor, the saddest of all keys.

02:56.060 --> 02:57.720
But when we get to the next line,

02:57.720 --> 02:59.320
because of vision softly creeping,

02:59.320 --> 03:01.220
something happens.

03:01.220 --> 03:02.060
Let's listen.

03:02.060 --> 03:07.260
I've come to talk with you again

03:07.260 --> 03:10.880
Because a vision softly creeping

03:10.880 --> 03:12.060
Ah!

03:12.060 --> 03:13.480
What was that?

03:13.480 --> 03:15.260
Suddenly a major chord,

03:15.260 --> 03:18.440
an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds,

03:18.440 --> 03:20.760
and every peach fuzz hair on the back

03:20.760 --> 03:24.200
of my biologically female neck stands on end.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.700
Hello, light.

03:25.700 --> 03:27.280
So the song has enticed me

03:27.280 --> 03:29.160
with its promise of company for misery,

03:29.160 --> 03:33.040
and then it has tricked me into feeling good.

03:33.040 --> 03:34.600
And that's what I like about art.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.420
It takes the standard disappointments

03:36.420 --> 03:37.840
and humiliations of life

03:37.840 --> 03:39.660
and cooks them into something worth

03:39.660 --> 03:41.100
getting off the floor for.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.520
Unfortunately, I don't really play music much anymore

03:43.520 --> 03:46.420
because my hands are too beautiful for instruments

03:46.420 --> 03:48.240
and my singing voice sounds like a man.

03:48.240 --> 03:51.540
So all I really have left is what any aspiring artist

03:51.540 --> 03:54.060
with no talent turns to, comedy.

03:54.060 --> 03:56.760
And I especially like dark comedy.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.060
You know, comedy about the things in life

03:59.060 --> 04:00.440
that are the most painful.

04:00.440 --> 04:03.380
To me, dark humor is kind of like a sad song.

04:03.380 --> 04:06.140
It takes your worst feelings, traumas, and anxieties

04:06.140 --> 04:08.660
and twists them into a source of pleasure.

04:08.660 --> 04:11.660
And don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?

04:11.660 --> 04:12.500
Ah!

04:12.500 --> 04:15.060
A lot of the time, that means joking about topics

04:15.060 --> 04:17.480
that in ordinary life are considered taboo.

04:17.480 --> 04:21.760
You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.620
Without the ability to joke and make fun

04:23.620 --> 04:25.720
of my own experiences of self-loathing,

04:25.720 --> 04:28.200
substance abuse, gender dysphoria,

04:28.200 --> 04:28.640
I mean, I'd probably be the one to say,

04:28.640 --> 04:30.340
I'd probably be on the floor right now

04:30.340 --> 04:31.960
looking for that Xanax.

04:31.960 --> 04:34.220
But this puts me in a difficult situation

04:34.220 --> 04:36.060
because I want to defend my sense of humor,

04:36.060 --> 04:38.580
which I feel is like the core of my personality

04:38.580 --> 04:39.880
and what keeps me alive.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.760
But at the same time, I've noticed that a lot of the people

04:42.760 --> 04:45.940
in our culture who are really big on defending provocative,

04:45.940 --> 04:48.840
controversial, politically incorrect comedy

04:48.840 --> 04:52.400
are kind of dick nuggets.

04:52.400 --> 04:53.640
Let's discuss this.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.880
And by discuss, I mean use it quietly

04:55.880 --> 04:57.960
and I'll tell you what to think.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.580
Two, dick nuggets.

05:00.580 --> 05:02.720
So the year 2016 had just begun

05:02.720 --> 05:05.900
and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.

05:05.900 --> 05:09.920
Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian,

05:09.920 --> 05:12.100
was ranting on Twitter for days and days

05:12.100 --> 05:15.780
about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.540
This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais,

05:17.540 --> 05:19.380
a man whose personal branding screams,

05:19.380 --> 05:21.660
I don't care about your feelings.

05:21.660 --> 05:25.200
I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.300
I am too much of a badass rebel

05:27.300 --> 05:29.720
to care what minorities think.

05:29.720 --> 05:34.380
But in January 2016, Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass,

05:34.380 --> 05:38.480
irreverent, not caring about your feelings kind of month.

05:38.480 --> 05:39.540
Why?

05:39.540 --> 05:42.200
Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes

05:42.200 --> 05:44.440
and upset a bunch of people by telling jokes

05:44.440 --> 05:46.800
about old Tran Ma Caitlyn Jenner.

05:46.800 --> 05:48.560
But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight.

05:48.560 --> 05:49.860
I've changed.

05:50.820 --> 05:54.100
Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.

05:54.100 --> 05:56.020
That's cutting edge material there, Rick.

05:56.020 --> 05:56.960
Very irreverent.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.400
Very rebellious.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.340
Very bad boy atheist.

06:00.340 --> 06:03.500
I mean, I do wish he wouldn't deadname trans people on stage,

06:03.500 --> 06:06.680
but honestly, the joke wasn't even as transphobic

06:06.680 --> 06:09.200
as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.

06:09.200 --> 06:13.200
Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it,

06:13.200 --> 06:15.300
and Ricky spent the rest of the month tweeting

06:15.300 --> 06:18.080
about how offending people is good, actually,

06:18.080 --> 06:20.720
and he definitely doesn't care that people were offended.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.640
But clearly, Twitter got to him,

06:22.640 --> 06:25.240
because two years later, he opened his Netflix special

06:25.240 --> 06:26.200
with a 13-minute bit, rehabbing, and saying,

06:26.200 --> 06:31.200
and doing a series of even more, um, irreverent jokes.

06:31.200 --> 06:34.200
Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?

06:34.200 --> 06:35.200
Well, I am a chimp.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.200
If I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.200
Pre-op.

06:38.200 --> 06:42.200
But, um, and don't ever deadname me.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.200
Don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.200
From now on, you call me Bobo.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.200
Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?

06:49.200 --> 06:52.200
Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage

06:52.200 --> 06:54.200
in a $20 million comedy special?

06:54.200 --> 06:55.320
My issue with this joke is that, you know, I don't know.

06:55.320 --> 06:59.320
My issue with this joke is that, apart from being extremely passÃ© and overdone,

06:59.320 --> 07:02.320
it also doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe

07:02.320 --> 07:04.320
that trans women are delusional men.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.320
And even then, it's just not very funny.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.320
But am I offended by the joke?

07:09.320 --> 07:14.320
Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed, unoriginal, and not very funny.

07:14.320 --> 07:17.320
And as a great comedian named Ricky Gervais once said,

07:17.320 --> 07:23.320
to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame, badly delivered, and not funny enough.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.320
So by that measure, yes, I'd say this.

07:25.320 --> 07:28.320
The fact that I identify as a chimp bit is pretty offensive.

07:28.320 --> 07:31.320
But I'm not bringing this old controversy up because I'm offended.

07:31.320 --> 07:35.320
I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example of a cycle

07:35.320 --> 07:38.320
it seems like our culture repeats about once a week.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.320
Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke,

07:41.320 --> 07:45.320
and other people are indignant about the fact that those people are offended.

07:45.320 --> 07:48.320
The cycle usually gets framed as a battle and a culture war

07:48.320 --> 07:51.320
that's supposedly going on between generation snowflake,

07:51.320 --> 07:53.320
easily triggered, humorless PC cucks,

07:53.320 --> 07:55.320
and badass, edgy, nothing-off-limits,

07:55.320 --> 07:57.320
free-speech truth-tellers.

07:57.320 --> 08:00.320
Now if this really is a culture war between two sides,

08:00.320 --> 08:02.320
then I am a double agent,

08:02.320 --> 08:06.320
because I'm a generation snowflake PC cuck who loves dank, edgy memes,

08:06.320 --> 08:11.320
and I've found myself on both sides of this type of conflict many, many times.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.320
So on the one hand, when I see the internet roasting a comedian

08:14.320 --> 08:16.320
for some shitty trans joke,

08:16.320 --> 08:19.320
my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.

08:19.320 --> 08:23.320
But my inner edge lady knows how it feels to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.

08:23.320 --> 08:28.320
And as someone who basically writes jokes about controversial topics for a living,

08:28.320 --> 08:35.320
I appreciate how difficult it is to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy

08:35.320 --> 08:40.320
while also keeping your moral compass from getting too jittery.

08:40.320 --> 08:45.320
So what I want to try to do is step away from the heat of these social media battles

08:45.320 --> 08:49.320
and try to abstract from them some more general philosophical questions.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.320
What is the purpose of comedy?

08:51.320 --> 08:53.320
What is it that makes comedy good or bad?

08:53.320 --> 08:56.320
Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?

08:56.320 --> 08:59.320
Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.320
Is it, as Aristotle said,

09:01.320 --> 09:04.320
the imitation of worse than average men?

09:04.320 --> 09:08.320
Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at for whatever reason?

09:08.320 --> 09:10.320
Well, I don't think there's a single objective answer.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.320
I mean, comedy's pretty subjective.

09:12.320 --> 09:16.320
But we can probably reach some kind of understanding by discussing this, right?

09:16.320 --> 09:18.320
And by we,

09:18.320 --> 09:20.320
again, I do mean me.

09:20.320 --> 09:23.320
The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouths shut.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.320
Straw men.

09:24.320 --> 09:26.320
So, as a trans woman,

09:26.320 --> 09:30.320
up here discussing why I don't think Ricky Gervais' trans jokes are funny,

09:30.320 --> 09:34.320
a lot of haters and losers out there are probably gonna try to straw man me.

09:34.320 --> 09:39.320
Did you just assume the straw person's gender?

09:39.320 --> 09:40.320
Ugh!

09:40.320 --> 09:44.320
Cis people have like two trans jokes and they're both so bad.

09:44.320 --> 09:46.320
Here's the straw person's, assholes.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.320
Straw person one.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.320
You hate free speech

09:49.320 --> 09:51.320
and are trying to silence comedians.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.320
I'm not trying to silence anyone.

09:53.320 --> 09:56.320
Comedians can say whatever they want on stage

09:56.320 --> 09:59.320
and I can say whatever I want about them.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.320
Straw person two.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.320
You just can't take the heat when the joke's on you.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.320
I transitioned on YouTube,

10:06.320 --> 10:09.320
making controversial political content all the while,

10:09.320 --> 10:11.320
and I read the comments.

10:11.320 --> 10:15.320
My hate-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.

10:15.320 --> 10:18.320
Of course, I do not have the internalized self-loathing

10:18.320 --> 10:20.320
that has damaged my psyche irreparably,

10:20.320 --> 10:22.320
but sweetie, who doesn't?

10:22.320 --> 10:24.320
Straw person three.

10:24.320 --> 10:27.320
You think no one should be allowed to joke about trans people.

10:27.320 --> 10:30.320
I invented joking about trans people.

10:30.320 --> 10:32.320
Ever heard of the mouth feel?

10:32.320 --> 10:33.320
I'm that tran.

10:33.320 --> 10:34.320
That's right.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.320
If I die tomorrow,

10:35.320 --> 10:39.320
my legacy will be that I applied wine-tasting terminology to fellatio,

10:39.320 --> 10:42.320
and I accept my destiny.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.320
Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.320
I live for trans jokes.

10:47.320 --> 10:50.320
I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them,

10:50.320 --> 10:52.320
because they don't know enough about trans people

10:52.320 --> 10:54.320
to know what the funny things are.

10:54.320 --> 10:57.320
And being transgender is honestly the perfect topic for comedy.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.320
Like, you used to live as one gender,

10:59.320 --> 11:01.320
and then you became a different gender.

11:01.320 --> 11:04.320
Every single thing about that is absolutely hilarious.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.320
But humor is in the details.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.320
And Ricky Gervais does not know the details,

11:08.320 --> 11:11.320
because he's clearly never been close to a trans person,

11:11.320 --> 11:15.320
and that's why he's still telling these Tinker Toy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner jokes.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.320
And it's too bad,

11:16.320 --> 11:19.320
because I'm actually starving over here for good trans comedy.

11:19.320 --> 11:21.320
And I mean the real dark stuff, too.

11:21.320 --> 11:23.320
I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline

11:23.320 --> 11:25.320
calling her hormones titty skittles.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.320
No, I like the edgy stuff.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.320
I like being on the edge.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.320
Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen,

11:30.320 --> 11:32.320
and I enjoy edging.

11:32.320 --> 11:35.320
Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy

11:35.320 --> 11:36.320
that I'd like to share with you,

11:36.320 --> 11:38.320
because when you're doing art criticism,

11:38.320 --> 11:41.320
it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.

11:41.320 --> 11:43.320
And the exemplary work I have in mind

11:43.320 --> 11:46.320
is one not a lot of people are talking about yet,

11:46.320 --> 11:49.320
but which I have no qualms placing in the same company

11:49.320 --> 11:51.320
as the works of Dante or Swift.

11:51.320 --> 11:52.320
I am, of course, referring to

11:52.320 --> 11:55.320
My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgias.

11:55.320 --> 11:57.320
If you don't know who Gigi is,

11:57.320 --> 11:58.320
first of all, who even are you?

11:58.320 --> 12:00.320
Do you have no respect for legends?

12:00.320 --> 12:01.320
She's a trans YouTuber,

12:01.320 --> 12:02.320
like the trans YouTuber,

12:02.320 --> 12:05.320
whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids

12:05.320 --> 12:07.320
and I Had Sex With a Dog

12:07.320 --> 12:10.320
long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.

12:10.320 --> 12:11.320
But in this critic's opinion,

12:11.320 --> 12:14.320
the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre

12:14.320 --> 12:15.320
is without a doubt,

12:15.320 --> 12:18.320
the singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.

12:18.320 --> 12:19.320
Let's do a close reading.

12:19.320 --> 12:22.320
4. Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience

12:22.320 --> 12:25.320
A great work of literature is never just a text.

12:25.320 --> 12:29.320
It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson

12:29.320 --> 12:33.320
would call a moment within an intertextual dialectic.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.320
Love that.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.320
Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience

12:36.320 --> 12:38.320
within its proper context.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.320
Several months earlier, Gigi had released a video

12:40.320 --> 12:42.320
about how she and her girlfriend

12:42.320 --> 12:43.320
were trying to have a child,

12:43.320 --> 12:44.320
so far without success,

12:44.320 --> 12:47.320
and so they went to see a fertility specialist.

12:47.320 --> 12:49.320
Apparently Gigi was not aware

12:49.320 --> 12:51.320
that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile,

12:51.320 --> 12:54.320
which, girl, they tell you like seven times

12:54.320 --> 12:55.320
before you start hormones.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.320
Like, how?

12:56.320 --> 12:57.320
We'll move past it.

12:57.320 --> 12:58.320
A few months later,

12:58.320 --> 13:01.320
the notification for My Sperm Bank Experience

13:01.320 --> 13:02.320
shows up on my phone,

13:02.320 --> 13:03.320
because that's right, I clicked the bell,

13:03.320 --> 13:06.320
and immediately I knew I was about to experience

13:06.320 --> 13:07.320
something special.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.320
The thumbnail for this video is so much greater

13:09.320 --> 13:11.320
than anything I've ever conceived of

13:11.320 --> 13:13.320
that honestly it makes me feel like a failure,

13:13.320 --> 13:15.320
both as a YouTuber and as a woman.

13:15.320 --> 13:18.320
The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature,

13:18.320 --> 13:20.320
the eyes are dotted with hearts,

13:20.320 --> 13:22.320
and her facial expression.

13:22.320 --> 13:24.320
Ew.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.320
Come.

13:25.320 --> 13:27.320
The video begins with Gigi explaining

13:27.320 --> 13:29.320
that in order to produce a sample for the clinic,

13:29.320 --> 13:32.320
she had to stop taking hormones for three months.

13:32.320 --> 13:33.320
So I hesitantly agreed.

13:33.320 --> 13:35.320
I was like, fine, I will stop all of my hormones,

13:35.320 --> 13:38.320
so, you know, my shit can get juicy again,

13:38.320 --> 13:40.320
and I can get a good little sample up in here.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.320
The sperm bank day arrives,

13:41.320 --> 13:42.320
she goes to the clinic,

13:42.320 --> 13:44.320
and approaches the receptionist.

13:44.320 --> 13:45.320
And I said,

13:45.320 --> 13:46.320
yes, ma'am,

13:46.320 --> 13:48.320
I am here to give sperm

13:48.320 --> 13:49.320
from me

13:49.320 --> 13:51.320
to be frozen

13:51.320 --> 13:52.320
now.

13:52.320 --> 13:54.320
The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room,

13:54.320 --> 13:56.320
which she describes with the precision

13:56.320 --> 13:58.320
of Mama Flaubert.

13:58.320 --> 13:59.320
I walk into this room,

13:59.320 --> 14:00.320
fluorescent lighting,

14:00.320 --> 14:01.320
the house.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.320
I was like, I can see every pore in my arm,

14:03.320 --> 14:05.320
like, Jesus, what do they want me to do here?

14:05.320 --> 14:06.320
And then the kicker,

14:06.320 --> 14:07.320
this, like, leather couch,

14:07.320 --> 14:09.320
the back is kind of, like, angled,

14:09.320 --> 14:11.320
so I guess, like, you can lean

14:11.320 --> 14:13.320
and really get into it or something.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.320
The doctor offers her lubrication,

14:15.320 --> 14:16.320
pornography if needed,

14:16.320 --> 14:17.320
and a donation cup.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.320
Gigi closes the door and gets to work.

14:20.320 --> 14:21.320
I get in the mood,

14:21.320 --> 14:22.320
I get in the zone,

14:22.320 --> 14:23.320
and I'm killing it, bitch.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.320
I am like, I'm gonna give the best sample ever.

14:25.320 --> 14:27.320
My kid is gonna be a God-sent child.

14:27.320 --> 14:28.320
Before I know it,

14:28.320 --> 14:30.320
the moment has crept up on me and happened,

14:30.320 --> 14:32.320
and it's been so long

14:32.320 --> 14:34.320
that it hits the wall behind me.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.320
And it's at this moment

14:36.320 --> 14:38.320
that glam goddess Gigi Gorgeous

14:38.320 --> 14:40.320
gets up off the leather couch

14:40.320 --> 14:41.320
and attempts to scrape

14:41.320 --> 14:43.320
a prodigious quantity of Gigi jism

14:43.320 --> 14:46.320
off the wall of a fluorescent-lit exam room

14:46.320 --> 14:49.320
in a desperate final bid to become a mother.

14:49.320 --> 14:50.320
And I took the cup,

14:50.320 --> 14:51.320
and I was, like, full-on, like,

14:51.320 --> 14:52.320
scraping it off the wall,

14:52.320 --> 14:53.320
because I was like,

14:53.320 --> 14:55.320
I'm not gonna let any little drop go to waste.

14:55.320 --> 14:56.320
You know, I'm here.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.320
This is, like, my moment.

14:57.320 --> 14:58.320
I'm trying to understand

14:58.320 --> 15:00.320
why this video makes me laugh so much.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.320
It's really the contrast of style and substance.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.320
Like, it wouldn't be funny

15:03.320 --> 15:06.320
if a masculine person told this story.

15:06.320 --> 15:07.320
It's funny because Gigi has this

15:07.320 --> 15:09.320
peak feminine storytelling style

15:09.320 --> 15:11.320
in this Real Housewives diction,

15:11.320 --> 15:14.320
but the story itself is about

15:14.320 --> 15:16.320
blasting a giant load onto a wall

15:16.320 --> 15:18.320
of a room full of leather and pornography.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.320
The dissonance between form and content

15:20.320 --> 15:22.320
is genius in that dissonance

15:22.320 --> 15:24.320
perfectly captures the absurdity

15:24.320 --> 15:25.320
of being transgender

15:25.320 --> 15:27.320
with a comedic incisiveness

15:27.320 --> 15:29.320
that Ricky Gervais could only dream of.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.320
I also really relate to this story

15:31.320 --> 15:33.320
because right before I started Hormones,

15:33.320 --> 15:35.320
I decided to freeze a sample of my own

15:35.320 --> 15:38.320
so I, too, have a sperm bank experience.

15:38.320 --> 15:40.320
And it was exactly like Gigi describes,

15:40.320 --> 15:41.320
down to every detail.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.320
It is not a dignified moment, ladies.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.320
There is just no way to feel like a woman

15:45.320 --> 15:47.320
while you're hastily rubbing one out

15:47.320 --> 15:50.320
in an over-lit room designed for men to ejaculate in.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.320
I feel so fish right now.

15:53.320 --> 15:55.320
For this five minutes in the exam room,

15:55.320 --> 15:56.320
I was a man.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.320
Now, I somehow managed to get most of my sample

15:58.320 --> 15:59.320
into the cup,

15:59.320 --> 16:01.320
but there's a different absurd detail to my story.

16:01.320 --> 16:03.320
The receptionist at the sperm bank

16:03.320 --> 16:05.320
saw on my paperwork that I was depositing

16:05.320 --> 16:07.320
because I was going to start feminizing hormones.

16:07.320 --> 16:10.320
And he asked me if there was a name I preferred he called me.

16:10.320 --> 16:12.320
In retrospect, he was actually really sweet

16:12.320 --> 16:13.320
and really cute.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.320
Not that anything was going to come of that at the time,

16:15.320 --> 16:18.320
since I was pretty everything and rough around the edges.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.320
Be honest, I was all edges.

16:19.320 --> 16:21.320
But he asked me for my preferred name,

16:21.320 --> 16:23.320
and I just blurted out Natalie.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.320
And so this was actually the first time

16:25.320 --> 16:27.320
anyone ever called me by my biological name.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.320
And it went like this.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.320
The receptionist at the sperm bank

16:30.320 --> 16:31.320
turned to me and said,

16:31.320 --> 16:33.320
right this way, Natalie.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.320
Here's a cup for you to bust a nut in.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.320
And that's how it went.

16:36.320 --> 16:39.320
And that's how my life as a woman began.

16:40.320 --> 16:41.320
Now in the end,

16:41.320 --> 16:44.320
Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.320
Her sample wasn't usable.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.320
She wanted to have a child with her own DNA,

16:48.320 --> 16:50.320
but she's been on hormones too long,

16:50.320 --> 16:51.320
and she just can't.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.320
And that revelation at the end of the video

16:53.320 --> 16:55.320
kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole story.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.320
In this ridiculous image of Gigi

16:57.320 --> 16:59.320
scraping ejaculate off the wall,

16:59.320 --> 17:01.320
I now see this primal maternal urge

17:01.320 --> 17:03.320
to produce and protect children.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.320
I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen

17:05.320 --> 17:07.320
prematurely from the nest.

17:07.320 --> 17:09.320
I see the Virgin Mary cradling her child.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.320
I really, really thought that I was going to have

17:12.320 --> 17:14.320
a good sample and I was going to be able to participate

17:14.320 --> 17:16.320
in having a baby with my DNA,

17:16.320 --> 17:18.320
but it's just not on the cards for me.

17:18.320 --> 17:20.320
And I really wanted to make this video more positive

17:20.320 --> 17:22.320
and funny because there is nothing I can do.

17:22.320 --> 17:24.320
And that's exactly it.

17:24.320 --> 17:26.320
That is the darkness.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.320
The darkness is my name for what I consider

17:31.320 --> 17:33.320
the highest form of comedy,

17:33.320 --> 17:35.320
where you take your own worst feelings,

17:35.320 --> 17:37.320
traumas, and anxieties,

17:37.320 --> 17:39.320
and twist them into a source of pleasure.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.320
The darkness is Richard Pryor

17:41.320 --> 17:43.320
running down the street in flames

17:43.320 --> 17:45.320
because he set himself on fire in a coke-fueled psychosis.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.320
The darkness is Gigi Gorgeous

17:47.320 --> 17:49.320
scraping her own prodigious jism

17:49.320 --> 17:51.320
off the wall of an exam room

17:51.320 --> 17:53.320
in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.320
If you can make these low points funny,

17:55.320 --> 17:57.320
then you're gonna be okay.

17:57.320 --> 17:58.320
You're gonna survive.

17:58.320 --> 17:59.320
You're gonna make it through life.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.320
And I need that now more than ever

18:01.320 --> 18:03.320
because trans experience is,

18:03.320 --> 18:05.320
in a lot of ways, pretty dark.

18:05.320 --> 18:07.320
But trans people make it through because

18:07.320 --> 18:09.320
we're good-humored and strong as fuck.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.320
Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to stop hormones

18:11.320 --> 18:13.320
before an operation, and I'm terrified of that.

18:13.320 --> 18:15.320
What's gonna happen to me when I stop hormones?

18:15.320 --> 18:17.320
Am I gonna become a man again?

18:17.320 --> 18:19.320
Because I don't know if I can handle that.

18:19.320 --> 18:21.320
I am thinking about names, though.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.320
Like, maybe Nathan? Or Jaden?

18:23.320 --> 18:25.320
I can see myself as a Jaden.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.320
See, I've gotta have my little jokey jokes,

18:27.320 --> 18:29.320
or I don't think I can make it through this.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.320
Like, when I have bottom surgery,

18:31.320 --> 18:33.320
I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it as

18:33.320 --> 18:35.320
my sex change operation.

18:35.320 --> 18:37.320
Because it makes me laugh. It brings me joy.

18:37.320 --> 18:39.320
Calling it gender confirmation surgery

18:39.320 --> 18:41.320
brings me no joy.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.320
Now, it's important to notice that just because

18:43.320 --> 18:45.320
it doesn't make me laugh doesn't mean

18:45.320 --> 18:47.320
it's a politically correct euphemism.

18:47.320 --> 18:49.320
Gender confirmation is a more accurate term

18:49.320 --> 18:51.320
than sex change, because

18:51.320 --> 18:53.320
you're literally not changing your sex.

18:53.320 --> 18:55.320
That's not what surgery does.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.320
But edgy people have their own kind of political

18:57.320 --> 18:59.320
correctness, where they mistake

18:59.320 --> 19:01.320
edginess for honesty, accuracy,

19:01.320 --> 19:03.320
and directness. But these are very

19:03.320 --> 19:05.320
different things. For example,

19:05.320 --> 19:07.320
George Carlin has a classic bit about euphemisms

19:07.320 --> 19:09.320
that has some great moments,

19:09.320 --> 19:11.320
but also some moments that are

19:11.320 --> 19:13.320
way off-base. For example,

19:13.320 --> 19:15.320
content wording ableist slur.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.320
They say they're going to pre-board those

19:17.320 --> 19:19.320
passengers in need of special assistance.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.320
Cripples!

19:23.320 --> 19:25.320
Simple, honest, direct language!

19:25.320 --> 19:27.320
So look, I understand the aesthetic

19:27.320 --> 19:29.320
preference for simple, honest, direct

19:29.320 --> 19:31.320
language, and the repulsion toward

19:31.320 --> 19:33.320
verbose, bureaucratic jargon. That's why

19:33.320 --> 19:35.320
so much of the rest of this bit is so good.

19:35.320 --> 19:37.320
But the word he just used is literally

19:37.320 --> 19:39.320
a slur, so I wonder if what you're being honest

19:39.320 --> 19:41.320
about is your feelings toward disabled

19:41.320 --> 19:43.320
people. Because the phrase passengers

19:43.320 --> 19:45.320
in need of special assistance is a little wordy,

19:45.320 --> 19:47.320
sure, but in this situation

19:47.320 --> 19:49.320
it's actually more accurate, since it also

19:49.320 --> 19:51.320
includes the elderly, the pregnant, anyone

19:51.320 --> 19:53.320
in need of assistance boarding.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.320
So I call my gender confirmation surgery

19:55.320 --> 19:57.320
getting a sex change, not because it's more

19:57.320 --> 19:59.320
direct and honest, but specifically

19:59.320 --> 20:01.320
because it's inaccurate and outdated.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.320
And that makes me laugh.

20:03.320 --> 20:05.320
Not because I'm a fearless truth teller, but

20:05.320 --> 20:07.320
because I'm a bad person.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.320
And I get to call it my sex change operation,

20:09.320 --> 20:11.320
but cis people don't get to call it

20:11.320 --> 20:13.320
that, because it's my darkness,

20:13.320 --> 20:15.320
not yours. Get your

20:15.320 --> 20:17.320
own darkness. When Ricky Gervais jokes about

20:17.320 --> 20:19.320
trans people, he's being a hack,

20:19.320 --> 20:21.320
because he knows nothing of our darkness.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.320
And when someone tries to joke about something that they're

20:23.320 --> 20:25.320
totally ignorant of, the result is usually

20:25.320 --> 20:27.320
clumsy, awkward, and not very

20:27.320 --> 20:29.320
funny. What I'd really like to see is

20:29.320 --> 20:31.320
if Ricky Gervais took all of that irreverent

20:31.320 --> 20:33.320
bad boy derisiveness and

20:33.320 --> 20:35.320
turned it within. Because

20:35.320 --> 20:37.320
within is where the darkness

20:37.320 --> 20:39.320
lies.

20:41.320 --> 20:43.320
Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite

20:43.320 --> 20:45.320
because as a lazy, selfish,

20:45.320 --> 20:47.320
preening attention whore

20:47.320 --> 20:49.320
who looks like a slightly more passable Ann Coulter

20:49.320 --> 20:51.320
with the voice of a tropical bird,

20:51.320 --> 20:53.320
there's a lot of material here to work with.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.320
But especially when it comes to the trans jokes,

20:55.320 --> 20:57.320
there is a faction of the

20:57.320 --> 20:59.320
trans community that is not

20:59.320 --> 21:01.320
amused by the buffoonery that goes on

21:01.320 --> 21:03.320
on this channel. I think the objection

21:03.320 --> 21:05.320
to it is best summed up by the comic

21:05.320 --> 21:07.320
artist Diana Gadsby, who in her stand-up special

21:07.320 --> 21:09.320
Nanette, said that when

21:09.320 --> 21:11.320
self-deprecation comes from someone who

21:11.320 --> 21:13.320
exists in the margins,

21:13.320 --> 21:15.320
It's not humility.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.320
It's humiliation.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.320
And to be honest, I felt a little

21:19.320 --> 21:21.320
called out by that.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.320
I put myself down in order to speak.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.320
In order to seek permission

21:25.320 --> 21:27.320
to speak.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.320
And she's not wrong, like that is how this works.

21:29.320 --> 21:31.320
In order to gain an audience as a trans

21:31.320 --> 21:33.320
person, you have to demonstrate

21:33.320 --> 21:35.320
what cis people call self-awareness.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.320
That is, you have to signal

21:37.320 --> 21:39.320
that you see yourself the way

21:39.320 --> 21:41.320
the audience sees you.

21:41.320 --> 21:43.320
Which can mean looking at yourself with a pretty

21:43.320 --> 21:45.320
merciless gaze. And of course I'm

21:45.320 --> 21:47.320
happy to do that, cause I have no

21:47.320 --> 21:49.320
self-respect and laughter is the only way

21:49.320 --> 21:51.320
to numb the pain. But the terrible thing

21:51.320 --> 21:53.320
about being a not normal with an audience

21:53.320 --> 21:55.320
is that you don't just get to be yourself.

21:55.320 --> 21:57.320
Because whether you like it or not,

21:57.320 --> 21:59.320
people will see you as a

21:59.320 --> 22:01.320
representative of the community.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.320
Ugh.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.320
So because of that responsibility, which I never

22:05.320 --> 22:07.320
asked for, I have to balance out

22:07.320 --> 22:09.320
the self-deprecation with a lot

22:09.320 --> 22:11.320
of positive messaging about my people.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.320
And that way, the dark jokes

22:13.320 --> 22:15.320
function as a spoonful of

22:15.320 --> 22:17.320
sugar to help the feminine

22:17.320 --> 22:19.320
penis go down. But even without

22:19.320 --> 22:21.320
the group representation issue,

22:21.320 --> 22:23.320
it definitely is possible to take

22:23.320 --> 22:25.320
self-deprecation too far.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.320
As I've said, I have been diagnosed

22:27.320 --> 22:29.320
with an incurable edginess of

22:29.320 --> 22:31.320
temperament, and I sometimes do feel

22:31.320 --> 22:33.320
suffocated by the safe space rules

22:33.320 --> 22:35.320
of a lot of trans spaces, even though

22:35.320 --> 22:37.320
those spaces are there for good reason

22:37.320 --> 22:39.320
and a lot of people need them. But sometimes

22:39.320 --> 22:41.320
this atmosphere of everything and everyone

22:41.320 --> 22:43.320
is valid all the time, no

22:43.320 --> 22:45.320
uncomfortable questions may be asked,

22:45.320 --> 22:47.320
any self-deprecation is a sign

22:47.320 --> 22:49.320
of traumatic internalized bigotry,

22:49.320 --> 22:51.320
I just need to get out of there for a

22:51.320 --> 22:53.320
while and find a place where I can relax

22:53.320 --> 22:55.320
and be my edgy self.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.320
I need a safe space for my edginess,

22:57.320 --> 22:59.320
where I can just blurt out whatever

22:59.320 --> 23:01.320
stupid question or joke comes to mind

23:01.320 --> 23:03.320
without being afraid that I'm gonna

23:03.320 --> 23:05.320
inflict horrible trauma on everyone around me.

23:05.320 --> 23:07.320
So I call up another

23:07.320 --> 23:09.320
transsexual edgelady, you know,

23:09.320 --> 23:11.320
kiki, accuse each other of being cross-dressers,

23:11.320 --> 23:13.320
and just laugh it all off.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.320
And it's so so cathartic to

23:15.320 --> 23:17.320
do that, but it does have

23:17.320 --> 23:19.320
to be done in moderation, cause

23:19.320 --> 23:21.320
there can come a point where you're picking at

23:21.320 --> 23:23.320
the wound instead of numbing it.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.320
And it mostly has to be done in private,

23:25.320 --> 23:27.320
because in public, you have to worry

23:27.320 --> 23:29.320
about how cis people will interpret

23:29.320 --> 23:31.320
it, and so you have to find a way to

23:31.320 --> 23:33.320
be self-deprecating without a

23:33.320 --> 23:35.320
social responsibility.

23:35.320 --> 23:37.320
Ugh, if there was ever a phrase that

23:37.320 --> 23:39.320
instantly deadens all laughter, it's

23:39.320 --> 23:41.320
social responsibility. But since

23:41.320 --> 23:43.320
it's kind of the central topic of the comedy

23:43.320 --> 23:45.320
culture war, I should probably say

23:45.320 --> 23:47.320
something about it, even though, believe

23:47.320 --> 23:49.320
me, I'd much rather go back to

23:49.320 --> 23:51.320
jabbering about my sex change.

23:53.320 --> 23:55.320
So what is a comedian's

23:55.320 --> 23:57.320
job? What is a comedian supposed to

23:57.320 --> 23:59.320
do? I suppose my ideal comedian

23:59.320 --> 24:01.320
is one who is perfectly able to

24:01.320 --> 24:03.320
balance the tension between shit

24:03.320 --> 24:05.320
posting and snowflakery.

24:05.320 --> 24:07.320
And this is an eternal tension,

24:07.320 --> 24:09.320
and must never be resolved.

24:09.320 --> 24:11.320
It is a tightrope I have devoted my

24:11.320 --> 24:13.320
life to walking. See, if the tension

24:13.320 --> 24:15.320
collapses into pure snowflakery,

24:15.320 --> 24:17.320
you get a moralist who might

24:17.320 --> 24:19.320
say that a comedian's purpose is to

24:19.320 --> 24:21.320
promote justice by punching up,

24:21.320 --> 24:23.320
by speaking truth to power, by

24:23.320 --> 24:25.320
exposing the flaws of bigoted mindsets,

24:25.320 --> 24:27.320
and so on. And these are all very admirable

24:27.320 --> 24:29.320
goals, but they leave out what I

24:29.320 --> 24:31.320
think is the essential purpose of comedy,

24:31.320 --> 24:33.320
which is to be funny.

24:33.320 --> 24:35.320
To surprise, to shock, to make

24:35.320 --> 24:37.320
people laugh. It's kind of like how some

24:37.320 --> 24:39.320
art and media critics only ever evaluate

24:39.320 --> 24:41.320
a work based on whether or not it's socially

24:41.320 --> 24:43.320
progressive, and don't seem to really

24:43.320 --> 24:45.320
think about aesthetic pleasure very

24:45.320 --> 24:47.320
much, which, to me, is the

24:47.320 --> 24:49.320
reason why art exists in the first place.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.320
But then again, I am a hedonistic

24:51.320 --> 24:53.320
bourgeois decadent, and should probably

24:53.320 --> 24:55.320
be sent to the guillotine at once.

24:55.320 --> 24:57.320
Just let me do my makeup first, so that when they hold my head

24:57.320 --> 24:59.320
up, everyone can see my beat, and their wings all

24:59.320 --> 25:01.320
fly to the Bastille. Also, someone please post

25:01.320 --> 25:03.320
the video to my Instagram, cause that's

25:03.320 --> 25:05.320
gonna get a lot of engagement.

25:05.320 --> 25:07.320
So the opposite of the pure snowflake

25:07.320 --> 25:09.320
is the pure shit poster,

25:09.320 --> 25:11.320
who might say that a comedian's purpose is to make

25:11.320 --> 25:13.320
an audience laugh by any means necessary.

25:13.320 --> 25:15.320
But that seems kinda barbaric,

25:15.320 --> 25:17.320
since, like, if a guard at a prison

25:17.320 --> 25:19.320
camp is torturing an inmate, and the other

25:19.320 --> 25:21.320
guards are laughing, does that count

25:21.320 --> 25:23.320
as comedy? Is a war crime funny?

25:23.320 --> 25:25.320
Well, according to the Geneva Convention,

25:25.320 --> 25:27.320
it's hilarious.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.320
The thing is, I don't think many comedians

25:29.320 --> 25:31.320
actually believe in a completely

25:31.320 --> 25:33.320
nihilistic vision of comedy.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.320
I think they sometimes pretend to,

25:35.320 --> 25:37.320
when they're trying to evade criticism.

25:37.320 --> 25:39.320
I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics,

25:39.320 --> 25:41.320
and listen to the way they talk about their

25:41.320 --> 25:43.320
heroes, Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.320
There's always an element of admiration

25:45.320 --> 25:47.320
for bravery, risk,

25:47.320 --> 25:49.320
subversion, truth-telling. In other words,

25:49.320 --> 25:51.320
there's a concern there for what is virtuous

25:51.320 --> 25:53.320
and what is true, not just

25:53.320 --> 25:55.320
for what makes people laugh. So maybe,

25:55.320 --> 25:57.320
before we can even talk about what's funny,

25:57.320 --> 25:59.320
we have to have a level of shared agreement

25:59.320 --> 26:01.320
about what is true and what is morally right.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.320
My objection to Ricky Gervais'

26:03.320 --> 26:05.320
trans jokes is not just that they're not

26:05.320 --> 26:07.320
funny. I think he's wrong about

26:07.320 --> 26:09.320
trans people, and I think his ignorance

26:09.320 --> 26:11.320
is infectious. I think he's

26:11.320 --> 26:13.320
stirring up bigoted sentiments in his

26:13.320 --> 26:15.320
audience, which has the consequence

26:15.320 --> 26:17.320
of making the world slightly scarier

26:17.320 --> 26:19.320
for people like me. And this is

26:19.320 --> 26:21.320
edginess at its worst. Just a

26:21.320 --> 26:23.320
privileged person with a platform

26:23.320 --> 26:25.320
punching down at a politically besieged group

26:25.320 --> 26:27.320
he understands nothing about. And that's

26:27.320 --> 26:29.320
what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension

26:29.320 --> 26:31.320
collapses into pure shitposting.

26:31.320 --> 26:33.320
It's boring.

26:33.320 --> 26:35.320
And immature. Like when someone says

26:35.320 --> 26:37.320
he wants to watch the world burn.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.320
You only get to watch when you have the privilege

26:39.320 --> 26:41.320
of not being on fire.

26:41.320 --> 26:43.320
It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.

26:43.320 --> 26:45.320
The darkness is finding

26:45.320 --> 26:47.320
a way to laugh about being

26:47.320 --> 26:49.320
on fire. Edginess is always

26:49.320 --> 26:51.320
adolescent. The darkness

26:51.320 --> 26:53.320
is edginess aged by

26:53.320 --> 26:55.320
time and pain. And it's only

26:55.320 --> 26:57.320
at that full maturity that comedy

26:57.320 --> 26:59.320
becomes art. That it becomes

26:59.320 --> 27:01.320
comparable to music.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.320
So, those are my thoughts.

27:03.320 --> 27:05.320
Like, comment, and

27:05.320 --> 27:07.320
subscribe.

27:07.320 --> 27:09.320
The end.

27:11.320 --> 27:13.320
Fine, I'll sing the song.

27:17.320 --> 27:19.320
I wish my brother George was here.

27:23.320 --> 27:25.320
Hello darkness

27:25.320 --> 27:27.320
my old friend.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.320
I've come to talk with you

27:31.320 --> 27:33.320
again.

27:33.320 --> 27:35.320
Because a vision

27:35.320 --> 27:37.320
softly creeping

27:39.320 --> 27:41.320
left its seeds while I was

27:41.320 --> 27:43.320
sleeping.

27:43.320 --> 27:45.320
And the vision

27:45.320 --> 27:47.320
that was

27:47.320 --> 27:49.320
planted in my

27:49.320 --> 27:51.320
brain

27:51.320 --> 27:53.320
still remains

27:53.320 --> 27:55.320
within the sound

27:55.320 --> 27:57.320
of silence.

27:59.320 --> 28:01.320
In restless dreams

28:01.320 --> 28:03.320
I walked alone.

28:03.320 --> 28:07.320
Narrow streets of

28:07.320 --> 28:09.320
cobblestone.

28:09.320 --> 28:11.320
Neath the

28:11.320 --> 28:13.320
halo of a

28:13.320 --> 28:15.320
street lamp.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.320
I turned my collar

28:17.320 --> 28:19.320
to the cold and damp.

28:19.320 --> 28:21.320
When my

28:21.320 --> 28:23.320
eyes were stopped

28:23.320 --> 28:25.320
by the flash of a

28:25.320 --> 28:27.320
neon light.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.320
That split the night

28:29.320 --> 28:31.320
and touched

28:31.320 --> 28:33.320
the sound.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.320
Of silence.

28:35.320 --> 28:37.320
And in the

28:37.320 --> 28:39.320
naked light I

28:39.320 --> 28:41.320
saw

28:41.320 --> 28:43.320
ten thousand people

28:43.320 --> 28:45.320
maybe more.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.320
People talking without

28:49.320 --> 28:51.320
speaking.

28:51.320 --> 28:53.320
People hearing

28:53.320 --> 28:55.320
without listening.

28:55.320 --> 28:57.320
People

28:57.320 --> 28:59.320
writing songs

28:59.320 --> 29:01.320
that

29:01.320 --> 29:03.320
voices never

29:03.320 --> 29:05.320
share.

29:05.320 --> 29:07.320
No one dared

29:07.320 --> 29:09.320
disturb the sound

29:09.320 --> 29:11.320
of

29:11.320 --> 29:13.320
silence.

29:15.320 --> 29:17.320
Stay

29:17.320 --> 29:19.320
gorgeous.
