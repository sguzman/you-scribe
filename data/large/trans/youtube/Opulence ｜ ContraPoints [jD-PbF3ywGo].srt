1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,380
Oh, hey, Quaritch.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
Hey, how are you, Quaritch?

3
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,040
Okay, listen, I know this looks bad.

4
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:37,140
I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine.

5
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:38,860
Well, fair enough.

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,080
But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?

7
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,260
How about this?

8
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,360
I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off,

9
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,020
but first you have to let me tell you my life story.

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,240
Fair? That's super fucking great.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,640
Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.

12
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,940
I'll start at the beginning.

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,660
My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:01,240
I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C.,

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,260
where the most exciting attraction for children

16
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:05,440
is the National Museum of Natural History.

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,500
At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children who,

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,760
might I add, deserve their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,140
Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong,

20
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,180
I liked a good Stegosaurus as much as the next five-year-old,

21
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,440
but my real passion was the gem and mineral hall.

22
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,780
Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.

23
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,280
It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,500
I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.

25
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,940
The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up

26
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:38,460
for my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.

27
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,840
Fuck you, Romano. I'm glad your father died.

28
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,200
Comrades, losers, and haters,

29
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,580
I would like to propose that aesthetic sensibility,

30
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,100
whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion, or music,

31
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,280
begins with absolute pleasure.

32
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,340
You rotate the crystal in your hand,

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,900
and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,720
Your nape hair stands on end,

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,720
and a tingle goes down your spine.

36
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,000
Yes, God!

37
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:07,160
But as you get older, things get more complicated.

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,980
Northern Virginia is McMansion country,

39
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,960
and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,

40
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,480
I remember riding around in the back of the minivan,

41
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,400
looking at some stylistically jumbled monstrosities,

42
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,720
and I would get excited by some little detail,

43
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,320
like, say, a circle of fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,320
But then my mom would say,

45
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,160
Look at this ostentatious trash!

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,200
So you learn.

47
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,700
You learn taste, according to the social class of your upbringing.

48
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,860
And with taste comes all this adult baggage,

49
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:39,860
snobbery, and pretense and conceit.

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,140
So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers,

51
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,300
but I assure you, I have nothing to do with taste.

52
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,780
I am but a simple queen, longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.

53
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:54,200
So, stripey sock cat girls of the heckin' revolutionary committee,

54
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,780
before you pass sentence,

55
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,340
allow me to make my case, Gorge.

56
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
One, success.

57
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,800
Oh, hey, how are you, Gorge?

58
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,240
Look, I like stuff.

59
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,240
I like shiny things.

60
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:30,200
For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.

61
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,820
But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.

62
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,120
There's a social context for it.

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,420
It generally means something.

64
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,640
Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace married a Turkmenistani dictator

65
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,560
and moved into a cheesecake factory?

66
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,080
Well, because he's trying to send a message.

67
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,500
Maybe to the world.

68
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Maybe to himself.

69
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
He's saying,

70
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Behold!

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:53,500
I am a winner.

72
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,560
A very stable genius, with one of the highest.

73
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,060
I am a winner.

74
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,560
I am a winner.

75
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
One of the highest IQs.

76
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,800
Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power.

77
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,260
From the pharaohs of Egypt, to the kings of France,

78
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:06,320
to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.

79
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,560
I guess God likes shiny things, too.

80
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:13,400
In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,040
It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American dream.

82
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,040
The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,040
In the words of Drake,

84
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,040
Started from the bottom, now we're here.

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,040
We're here.

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,540
We're here.

87
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:29,880
Started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.

88
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,400
Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.

89
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,400
You've made it.

90
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,400
You're rich, bitch.

91
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,940
Remember in high school when you had to read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?

92
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,060
The character Jay Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties, but he throws them

93
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,040
anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it, that he's a success, that he's

94
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,040
worth something.

95
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,380
And as we all remember, in the end, they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to

96
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,380
save the Hall of Hrothgar.

97
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,900
At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay about how the theme of

98
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:04,100
The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.

99
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,100
I got a D-.

100
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:10,800
I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like money, I like shining, I like those Balenciagas.

101
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Fuck.

102
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms and driving lambs and all

103
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,800
that shit, but teacher, pick me, pick me.

104
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,180
Let's talk about symbols, let's talk about allegory, let's talk about metaphor, let's

105
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
talk about themes.

106
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,400
Fellow students, I'm sorry.

107
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,580
Let us place the text in historical context.

108
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,040
Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper to making money moves.

109
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,640
That's the American Dream.

110
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,940
Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism, it's a celebration of success

111
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,780
for people who often come from backgrounds where that kind of success is really improbable.

112
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,440
Don't you think it's kinda weird that conservatives still say, rap music is the reason for the

113
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,640
problems with the blacks?

114
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,760
For conservatives, the American Dream.

115
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,240
The American Dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.

116
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,100
And is there any sector of our culture where the American Dream is more unironically celebrated

117
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,100
than hip-hop?

118
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,920
It's not just hip-hop, though.

119
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,160
Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.

120
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,380
You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci and the Ferraris and the Fendi

121
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,800
and the Bugattis and the Armani and the Maseratis.

122
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,500
Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit, which,

123
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,560
to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.

124
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,540
Turn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care, and replace it with a large-scale

125
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:31,440
figure of Donatella Versace holding a bottle of Cristal.

126
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,560
That's at least a more honest representation of our culture than the hypocritical cheese

127
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,800
verse currently inscribed on Liberty Island.

128
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,320
I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?

129
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,140
Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.

130
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,700
We have standards in this country.

131
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,340
Listen up, America.

132
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,620
We live in a society.

133
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,240
A society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

134
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,880
Not of climbers, but of...

135
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,400
Graspers.

136
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,160
To paraphrase Iain Danskin, maybe anyone can achieve the American dream, but everyone

137
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,160
cannot.

138
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,520
And the fact of the matter is, most people don't.

139
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,600
I mean, what would it even mean to be rich unless someone else was poor?

140
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,440
I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?

141
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,340
Not all the rich people, that's for sure.

142
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,060
So when you live in a society that constantly equates wealth and success, but which is also

143
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,120
so unequal that most people will never be wealthy, well...

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:31,720
What's the average person supposed to do?

145
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Two.

146
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,720
Fantasy.

147
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
Sigh.

148
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,720
I wish the world were my gem collection.

149
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,720
I wish I owned everything.

150
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
I'm really just the worst kind of philistine, you know?

151
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,720
I go to an art museum and it's like, Monet, Rembrandt, okay, that's super fucking great,

152
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,120
but can I buy it?

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Well, no.

154
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
I can't buy it.

155
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,720
The grim reality is, you can't own everything.

156
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,720
So what do you do?

157
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Well...

158
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,720
You fake it.

159
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
You create an illusion.

160
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
I don't own this building.

161
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,320
And you boob off the streets of Baltimore and walk in here, as indeed you did.

162
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,320
But that's okay.

163
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,320
I need a witness.

164
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,320
I need you to see me here, among the other art.

165
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,320
Where I belong.

166
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,320
Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?

167
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,320
Makes me feel valuable.

168
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:21,320
You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent, because opulence is not abundance.

169
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,320
Opulence is the aesthetic.

170
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Of abundance.

171
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
It is the aesthetic of owning everything.

172
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,720
The phrase opulence, you own everything is at this point basically a gay internet meme.

173
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,920
But it originally comes from the documentary Paris Is Burning, about the Harlem ballroom

174
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:45,720
culture in the 1980s, where it's proclaimed by MC Junior LaBeija.

175
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,720
O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E.

176
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,720
Opulence.

177
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
You own everything.

178
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
You own everything!

179
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,480
It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle of luxury and decadence.

180
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:03,440
In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says of the queer Black and Latin American participants of the Bulls,

181
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,400
You know, a lot of those kids that are in the Bulls, they don't have two of nothing.

182
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,120
Some of them don't even eat.

183
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,560
So, ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamour,

184
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,120
an illusion created by skillful artifice.

185
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
Participants walk categories like executive realness,

186
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,360
with the goal of being indistinguishable from a real executive.

187
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,920
Nowadays, every white queer says the word realness.

188
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,760
I guess in kind of a frivolous way.

189
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,720
I mean, Whomst Among Us honestly hasn't slipped into a dissociative fugue state,

190
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,160
dressed up as a clown, kidnapped a few neighborhood children,

191
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,000
and told the cops, I'm giving you John Wayne Gacy realness, hunty.

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,520
I did it, officer.

193
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,520
I did the cultural appropriation.

194
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,960
I am a colonizer.

195
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,560
I am part of the problem.

196
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
And I'm sorry.

197
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,960
Take me away, boys.

198
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:47,920
That's crazy.

199
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,520
That's mega coconuts.

200
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,800
I guess I should explain that

201
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,760
American slang works according to what we might call a trickle-up model of linguistics.

202
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,600
All the new words are invented by the most marginalized gay and trans people of color.

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
Then those words trickle up to straight black people and white gays,

204
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,600
and then finally white cishets start using them.

205
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,200
A lot of times the original meaning or context gets lost along the way.

206
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
So originally, realness, as Sean Faye put it,

207
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,840
was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume,

208
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,320
but a tragicomic disguise of the chasm between what is being emulated

209
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,200
and what is absent, namely racial justice, class equality, and safety.

210
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,680
Realness, in that sense, is a much more complicated and interesting concept

211
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,320
than the generic trans notion of passing.

212
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,760
Passing is just looking like a 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio girl.

213
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,080
Whereas in the ballroom sense, realness has a subtext of defying injustice.

214
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,360
You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle

215
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,760
that has been unjustly kept beyond your reach.

216
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,680
You're not really an executive, but you're looking like an executive.

217
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,160
And therefore, you're not just an executive.

218
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,200
You're showing the straight world that I can be an executive.

219
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,360
If I had the opportunity, I could be one.

220
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,960
Because I can look like one.

221
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,800
I think one reason there's been a surge of interest in 80s ballroom culture,

222
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
such as the FX drama Pose, which is set during the era,

223
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,200
is that it dramatizes an essential truth about America.

224
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,640
It's really important to people in this country to at least sometimes feel

225
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,160
like they're living a luxe life, even if in fact, they aren't.

226
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,920
Las Vegas is essentially an entire city that exploits that need.

227
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,520
Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio, and the San Francisco,

228
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:24,160
are designed to make you feel like a fancy bitch,

229
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,320
even though they're actually just high-rise traps,

230
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,080
designed to lure you in and take your money.

231
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,920
And if there's one thing I can't stand,

232
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
it's traps.

233
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,760
But the trap works, because part of what it is to be American

234
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,000
is to want to feel like a fancy bitch.

235
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,280
I actually love Vegas.

236
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,680
I was there last year for the only good YouTuber,

237
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
Lindsay Ellis's bachelorette party.

238
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,400
I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.

239
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,120
But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-forties,

240
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
I did once experience the first exciting stages of a gambling habit.

241
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,920
I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity,

242
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,080
and had some good luck playing blackjack.

243
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:06,080
I mean, I wasn't a high-roller or anything,

244
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,800
but my first time I walked out with an extra $200.

245
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,040
And that was a lot of money to me.

246
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,880
At the time, I was working a customer service job making $10 an hour,

247
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,360
so to make $200 in five minutes, that's worth 20 hours.

248
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
It's a soul-crushing customer service toil.

249
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,000
Before taxes.

250
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,760
So I went back and I went back, but I never got lucky again.

251
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,640
And fortunately, that was enough to discourage me.

252
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,120
I remember one time as I was leaving the casino,

253
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,480
I saw this man standing outside with this look on his face

254
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,760
that I have never seen on a human being before or since.

255
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,840
Just absolute shock, despair, this deep shame and self-disgust.

256
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,280
The kind of face that says,

257
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,120
I'm gonna have to explain to my wife

258
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,640
that I spent the kids' college savings on a high-limit slot machine.

259
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,200
And there is nothing opulent about that,

260
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,480
nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs with IV drips

261
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,720
trying to pay off their hospital bills.

262
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,720
America, we are a bad country.

263
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,320
Donald Trump is a Vegas man.

264
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,640
He's pulling this grift on the entire country.

265
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:12,960
And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence of the American dream

266
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,360
is more enchanting to the imagination

267
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,800
than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.

268
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,160
So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell,

269
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,760
but in fact, there are two very different types of magic at work.

270
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,720
For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex,

271
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,800
a demonstration of their wealth and power.

272
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
But for the marginalized and impoverished,

273
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,040
opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and power they've been denied.

274
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function,

275
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,120
it's like the difference between a viper and a butterfly serving viper realness.

276
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,520
3. Class

277
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,840
Hey, how are you?

278
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,120
Hey, how are you?

279
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,320
Hey, how are you?

280
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,080
Hey, how are you?

281
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,760
People don't understand how difficult it is to be this blonde.

282
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,400
You know, a biological female that looks like me,

283
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,480
I'm afraid some transvestite psycho is gonna sneak in through a rear window

284
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,400
and I'll have to dial M for murder.

285
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,160
I get vertigo just thinking about it.

286
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,400
I've always found the Marxist analysis of class difficult to apply to the present day.

287
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,160
As a typical modern woman, it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to.

288
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,000
I haven't been hope, and I hope, and I hope, and I hope?

289
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,440
That's praxis.

290
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,080
Like bourgeoisie and proletariat?

291
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:22,800
Hoompst.

292
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,680
Who is she?

293
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,280
Where's her summer collection?

294
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,600
That's super fucking great, but can't I buy it?

295
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,520
Marx's typical examples are a factory owner and a factory worker.

296
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,320
Now, I could be am Shocker but personally,

297
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,080
I've never met a factory worker, or a factory owner for that matter.

298
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:42,160
They all must be on a brand trip to China work on the enfm's summer collection.

299
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,640
What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles,

300
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,760
is that the bougies own them out of proportion.

301
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,000
Just give them a sound interessante kick and I'm using all that subactus.

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,480
the means of production and the proles work for wages. But what about a bartender who owns the

303
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,760
bar she works in? What about YouTubers? Which side of the revolution are we on? I'm just trying to

304
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,080
figure out where I stand here. Because if the revolution starts on Twitter, my head is definitely

305
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:04,240
going in the basket. And then I'll have no choice but to do the conservative talk show circuit.

306
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,080
You know, like most people whose brains are detached from their bodies.

307
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,800
Maria Antoinette did nothing wrong, eh, are you?

308
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:15,040
I feel like a class analysis with only two classes must be overly simplistic.

309
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,560
My favorite book about class in America is Paul Fussell's Class,

310
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,120
A Guide Through the American Status System, which describes nine distinct classes.

311
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:28,080
Fussell is not as concerned with economic relations between classes as he is with status,

312
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,200
what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.

313
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,360
Things like education, style, taste, and attitude towards money.

314
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,080
Now the book was published in 1983, so a lot of the references and details are out of date,

315
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:43,680
but there's an eerie familiarity to a lot of the core observations.

316
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,960
And it's also just pretty funny.

317
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,800
Like his quasi-scientific observation that the higher your social class,

318
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:53,200
the smaller the balls in the sports you play. Or his description of middle class living rooms.

319
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:58,800
Your real middle class refuses to show any but the most bland books and magazines

320
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:04,960
on its coffee tables. Otherwise, expressions of opinion, awkward questions, or even ideas

321
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,600
might result.

322
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,320
One of Fussell's core themes is that it's not how much money you have that defines your class,

323
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,800
so much as how you got your money. If you had to work for your money, then you're not

324
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:20,720
really upper class. The upper class has inherited wealth, and as a result they're very confident.

325
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,360
They don't feel the need to prove themselves.

326
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,840
Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted their position on the ladder.

327
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:32,080
But then there's the middle class, who are social climbers, and who compensate for their

328
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:37,360
insecurities by, for example, placing a pretentious collage of university bumper

329
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,760
stickers on the back of the family car. This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.

330
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:44,640
The higher and lower classes, there's some good in them, but, uh,

331
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,840
the middle classes are all affectation and conceit and pretense and concealment.

332
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:55,360
Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated by people with something to prove,

333
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:59,360
whether it's marginalised ballroom performers proving their worth to themselves,

334
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,960
or the new rich building McMansions to show off their wealth to others.

335
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:07,280
So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump. He inherited his wealth, so

336
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,280
he should know better than to have golden faucets. But he doesn't. As Fran Lebowitz said,

337
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,640
he's a poor person's identity.

338
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,080
He's a rich person's identity. And that's actually his charm. It's part of his mass appeal.

339
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:25,040
Trump behaves like a prole who won the lottery. So there's actually something kind of relatable,

340
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:30,080
unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic about the golden faucets. People who have wealth,

341
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,400
but not class, are actually very popular in this country.

342
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
We don't like class here, because class is exclusionary.

343
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:44,560
Whereas anyone can acquire wealth, we tell ourselves, so wealth feels potentially inclusive

344
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,600
of everyone, even though in practice, it isn't.

345
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Now, the upper-class cultural elite in this country, the real classy people,

346
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,080
are mostly very unlike Trump. Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy,

347
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:02,240
they embrace the reserved old-money values of aristocratic wasps, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.

348
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:06,640
Fussell notes, for instance, that they tend to value privacy over showing off.

349
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,560
They like to live at the end of long driveways and houses away from public view.

350
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:14,320
They dress down while travelling so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.

351
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:18,000
These are essentially survival skills of the experienced rich.

352
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,120
If you flaunt your wealth too much, people might rob you,

353
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,280
or they might get envious and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.

354
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,120
Or worse, taxation.

355
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:33,600
Old money knows this, but new money just cannot resist the temptation to show off.

356
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,640
I actually wonder if the old waspy upper-class is dying out.

357
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,480
I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory of money over class.

358
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,480
His presidency validates the idea that you can be as vulgar as you want,

359
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:46,960
so long as you have the cash to back it up.

360
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,320
So the old-class system is dying out, and in its place,

361
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,680
we have universally adopted the mindset of the nouveau riche.

362
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,840
If you got it, flaunt it.

363
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,960
If you haven't got it, find a way to flaunt it anyway.

364
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:03,200
Now, I'm sure this is all very tragic and disappointing to people of class and taste,

365
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,960
but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur, it's actually fantastic news.

366
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,240
4. Taste

367
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:12,320
4. Taste

368
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,000
4. Taste

369
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,240
Listen comrades, I've been pretty down on opulence so far,

370
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,840
and I could continue analyzing it in terms of inequality and class struggle,

371
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,760
but you already know all that.

372
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,080
That's why you came to cut my head off.

373
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,160
But hold on, is that really all there is to aesthetics?

374
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,080
Marxist economic analysis?

375
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,600
Or the SJW version that makes everything about race and gender?

376
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,200
As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,

377
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary,

378
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,000
to simultaneously enjoy music,

379
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,560
media,

380
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,480
while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.

381
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,480
So what about the enjoyment part?

382
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,360
Surely you wouldn't be ahead of Queen just for liking shiny thing.

383
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,680
Is there no room for art for art's sake?

384
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:58,560
The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen,

385
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:02,080
Fräulein Emanuel Hildegard Marlene Kennedy Davenport Kant,

386
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,800
said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested,

387
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,600
that is, completely free of any material desire.

388
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,720
Of course, Miss Thing also founded the hashtag nofap movement,

389
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
so I don't know how seriously we want to take that.

390
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,840
But it's actually true.

391
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,880
It's actually kind of similar to what Plato said about aesthetic sense,

392
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,240
that it merely begins with a desire for the bodies of beautiful boys,

393
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,160
which is really just a shadow of our true longing for the concept of beauty itself.

394
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:28,400
God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy is just a bunch of repressed homos

395
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,960
trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.

396
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,240
What must that be like?

397
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,640
From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart,

398
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,320
that must be super fucking hard for them, I can't even imagine.

399
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,920
I mean, it makes sense, really.

400
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,760
Straight men don't have these problems.

401
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,680
They got away with painting softcore for 500 years.

402
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,120
They never had to think about it.

403
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,640
I guess Nietzsche is the exception.

404
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:51,680
He was straight and a philosopher, but he was an incel and, let's be honest,

405
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,120
definitely a chaser.

406
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,240
The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history is the

407
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:59,360
respectable English gentleman, Oscar Wilde.

408
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,560
According to Wilde,

409
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:06,240
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.

410
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,520
This is a fault.

411
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,160
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.

412
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,520
For these, there is hope.

413
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,400
They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.

414
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,240
Spoken like a poet.

415
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,840
You want to be cultivated, don't you?

416
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,920
Don't you think I'm beautiful?

417
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,360
Look, I'll play it your way.

418
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,320
Let's swing back to the other side of the Sarkeesian pendulum here.

419
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,040
As sentimental as I personally am about art for art's sake and all of that,

420
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,600
but from a strictly sociological perspective,

421
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,000
I have to admit, taste is pretty intimately related to power.

422
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,040
When you go to a museum,

423
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,840
you look at various objects on pedestals under special lighting that makes them appear magical.

424
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,160
Now, that's also what you do in Bed Bath & Beyond,

425
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,840
but the difference is that at the museum, you can't buy anything.

426
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,800
And that turns out to be important for Kantian reasons.

427
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,680
In the retail context of commodity fetishism,

428
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,200
you correlate your aesthetic taste with material desire.

429
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,040
Whereas in the museum, because you can't buy anything,

430
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,680
you feel like your aesthetic pleasure is pure,

431
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,880
that you're simply enjoying out of context objects.

432
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,720
But of course, that's an illusion.

433
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
The museum is the context,

434
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,640
and the context is telling you that the things you're looking at are art.

435
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,960
So whoever decides what's in the museum,

436
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,960
decides what good taste is,

437
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,080
what's beautiful,

438
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,040
what's valuable.

439
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:30,320
Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.

440
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,760
Beyonce and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre,

441
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,320
conferring upon themselves the status and the cultural grandeur of the art.

442
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,840
But it's not just a flex.

443
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,680
It means something more than that

444
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,880
because of the racial disparity.

445
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,000
Black people and black art are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre.

446
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,800
So seeing Jay and Bey there looking so regal,

447
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:54,480
with black dancers even overshadowing canonical European art,

448
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,320
it's like a full moment.

449
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,400
A lot of people have a deep longing for the sense of dignity and grandeur conferred by classical art.

450
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:08,000
That's why trans women love that picture someone photoshopped of the three graces, but with dicks.

451
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,520
I'll admit that silly picture actually had an emotional effect on me.

452
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:20,800
Because here in The West, it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful until you've seen it sculpted in white marble.

453
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:25,280
Oh, speaking of which, white marble is a lie.

454
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:34,880
For most of art history history, scholars have insisted that the iconic ghostly whiteness of classical statues was a distinguishing feature of western sculpture,

455
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,640
proof of the elegant taste of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

456
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,520
In reality, of course, it turns out they were painted the color white,

457
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,180
of something a drag queen might wear to a quinceanera.

458
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,060
Scholars had been noticing paint remnants on these statues

459
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:50,260
for hundreds of years, but were totally in denial about it

460
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,360
because the pure whiteness of these figures

461
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:53,920
was like a sacred dogma.

462
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,620
Margaret Talbot in the New Yorker

463
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,880
attributes the dogma in part to

464
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:00,200
a tendency to equate whiteness

465
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,360
with beauty, taste, and classical ideals,

466
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,560
and to see color as alien, sensual, and garish.

467
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:11,760
In 2008, Fabio Berri, an art historian

468
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,160
who is now at Stanford, complained that

469
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,780
a boldly colored recreation of a statue

470
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,920
of the Emperor Augustus at the Vatican Museum

471
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,080
looked like a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.

472
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,540
Hey, how are you?

473
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,360
And you just know that when the news first broke,

474
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,320
some horrified WASP classicist turned to a colleague

475
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,320
and said, oh, Kingsley, it looks, it looks Mexican.

476
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:41,200
In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues,

477
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,480
some art historians have been harassed by the alt-right,

478
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,680
who don't take kindly to anyone questioning

479
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,180
their white supremacist myths about antiquity.

480
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:51,300
There's some pretty insidious, uh,

481
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,620
identitarian prejudices here

482
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,100
hiding out under the cloak of taste.

483
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:59,040
Good taste for upper and middle class white people

484
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,540
generally includes a reflexive disdain

485
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:05,540
for anything a little bit too colorful.

486
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,560
It's these classes that constantly use, you know,

487
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,520
the word, white supremacy, and white supremacy,

488
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,800
they use the words gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.

489
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,840
Joe Weldon, author of Fierce,

490
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,580
The History of Leopard Print, observes that

491
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,180
tacky as a concept refers to the lack of cultivation

492
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,880
or the resistance to taste,

493
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,340
and more often than not refers to tastes

494
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,340
that are not suitably conservative.

495
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,700
Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine, ethnic,

496
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,220
queer, deviant, not manly, not practical,

497
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:36,040
not business-like, not serious.

498
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,520
Aesthetic excess.

499
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,720
Particularly of colors, patterns, and bling

500
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,520
is especially offensive to conservative wasp taste.

501
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,440
Tacky is often where the imagination runs free,

502
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,320
where the heart is, where the soul is, and where the fun is.

503
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,460
Well, that's good news,

504
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,940
because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.

505
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,320
I can't imagine why.

506
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,180
Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.

507
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,320
Or camp.

508
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,680
People call me camp,

509
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,600
and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.

510
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,140
I suppose it depends on what camp means.

511
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,440
Camp was the theme of this year's

512
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,780
Met Gala, and my feed was flooded

513
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:12,800
with Brooklynite intellectuals competing to outwit each other

514
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:16,100
with the most erudite definition of what camp really is.

515
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:19,240
What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.

516
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,080
The first I'll call coward camp,

517
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:24,860
this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.

518
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:27,520
I have no respect for this whatsoever.

519
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,280
This is nothing but an anxious

520
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,840
and defensive refusal to take a risk.

521
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,680
You think you're safe from criticism

522
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,840
because your look is bad on purpose.

523
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
Fuck that.

524
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,900
Don't take a stand, you pussy bitch.

525
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,880
I take great offense to this as a person whose look is bad on accident,

526
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,960
and Susan Sontag agrees with me.

527
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,200
In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between

528
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,660
naive and deliberate camp.

529
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,620
Pure camp is always naive.

530
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:57,160
Camp which knows itself to be camp or camping is usually less satisfying.

531
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,600
Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness,

532
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,080
a grand artistic vision that gets a little out of control

533
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,000
and enters into absurd territory.

534
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,840
Hey, how are you?

535
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
I don't know.

536
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,520
My philosophy of style is that people should wear what looks good to them.

537
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,680
I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.

538
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:17,820
I think my aesthetic is good.

539
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,960
This is what looks good to me, though I'm aware other people might judge it.

540
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,020
I like what John Waters said about there being good bad taste and bad bad taste.

541
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:32,620
One must remember, there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.

542
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,000
To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

543
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,720
I've wondered.

544
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,320
I've wondered for a long time why I'm so attracted to bad taste.

545
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,960
Like, I technically have the education to know better.

546
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,020
I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.

547
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,680
Why am I so tacky?

548
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:55,660
I think it's because I'm a transsexual, which lowers you at least a class.

549
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:00,180
If you were born upper class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now, bitch.

550
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,480
If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.

551
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now, bitch.

552
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,480
If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.

553
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
And if you were born sexual-

554
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,460
Oh, sweaty.

555
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,500
You'd better start a revolution.

556
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,500
Marsha P. Johnson?

557
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Hey, how're you?

558
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,620
CHICKS WITH BRETT.

559
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:19,080
5.

560
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,200
GLAMOUR

561
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,740
Trans women have a special relationship with glamour.

562
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,820
At least, those of us who came of age in the 1960s.

563
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:29,540
At least the most basic everyday sense, GLAM is a way of styling yourself.

564
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,420
It is luxuriant hair.

565
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,000
It's high drama makeup.

566
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,260
It's long nails.

567
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,140
It's glitter everywhere.

568
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,200
It's posing like a fellow human.

569
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:41,000
a fashion model but originally the word glamour comes from the scottish word grammary meaning

570
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,040
magic or enchantment and glamour still involves a kind of illusion or charm cast on a spectator

571
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:53,800
the connection between glamour and opulence is explored in the 2004 essay viva mcglam is

572
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:59,400
transgenderism a critique of or capitulation to opulence-driven glamour models by transgender

573
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,800
writer and underground house music producer terry temlitz aka dj sprinkles sprinkles writes

574
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:11,400
europe's ruling elite used opulence as an ideological weapon to befuddle the lower classes

575
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:17,080
with glimpses of heaven on earth a lifestyle so foreign and unattainable that it could only be the

576
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:23,160
result of divination it is this spell of opulence that led to our current definition of glamour

577
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:29,560
which is more associated with wealth than magic sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour

578
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:35,480
or grammar that was associated with witchcraft paganism and sexual deviancy but in our capitalist

579
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:42,200
society glamour is a spell of opulence conjuring up what is often a fantasy of a lavish life

580
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:47,400
for example a lot of drag queens practice this sort of illusionism by impersonating celebrities

581
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,840
thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses pop stars and models second hand sprinkles is bothered

582
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,800
by the way this sort of second-hand glamour acquires its power from unquestioned social

583
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:04,920
hierarchies glamour is suspect as a critical-minded political forum because it is about social distance

584
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:11,160
integration the promise of the pop glam diva is not the promise of social transformation

585
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,560
but individual transformation in which the exploited becomes the exploiter it is the promise

586
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:25,240
of an individual's class mobility not social betterment or class critique it is by and large

587
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:31,160
the american dream now i have to admit this is a version of the american dream that hits pretty

588
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:35,560
close to home for me the overarching plot line of my whole entire youtube gender journey

589
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:40,440
is that i used to be a tragic mess and i'm still a tragic mess but when i started this

590
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,240
channel i was a broke gender dysphoric alcoholic cross-dressing tragic mess

591
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,800
i'd play a clip but honestly those videos are still too painful for me to even glance at

592
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:54,600
and now i mean look at me look how far i've come i look like a moderately talented female

593
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,200
impersonator hey how are you those first several months of transition though they were rough i had

594
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:05,640
a lot of trouble in the beginning i used to get laughed out of restaurants and i was so proud that

595
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:11,320
i wouldn't let anyone see how much that stuff hurt me you know i would say well them i know i'm

596
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:18,280
great and then i'd go cry my eyes out alone in my car and i was a youtuber that whole time too which

597
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:24,760
i mean the cyber bullying alone i don't think you can even imagine the extent of it if you

598
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:30,360
haven't been in that situation you know hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice picking apart

599
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,320
your face and body clocking your clothes and makeup digging up your past trying to deduce

600
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:42,520
your sexual pathology from the shape of your skull a lot of i mean a lot of it's hilarious to me now

601
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:48,760
but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain but that pain spurred me to work on my glow up

602
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:54,680
like it was the cure for cancer like my life depended on it which is basically how it felt

603
00:31:54,680 --> 00:32:01,880
now sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as as one tweeter put it cripplingly obsessed with

604
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,400
passing and passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me but that was something that i wanted to

605
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:12,280
do for me but glam to me is not about passing i think i actually pass better in no makeup than i

606
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,760
do an eye shadow out to here you know a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here and people think

607
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:22,360
she's just really into makeup or instagram or cosplay or something but when i do it i think

608
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:30,600
it looks like drag which serves to call more attention to my situation but on youtube i mean

609
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:35,240
clearly i don't try to pass as a normal woman everyone here knows i'm trans anyway so i'm not going to pass as a normal woman

610
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:41,400
what's the point i would describe this presentation as female impersonator and that's basically what

611
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,880
i am a female female impersonator and i present this way because it's fun i find it artistically

612
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:52,920
fulfilling and let's be honest there's part of me that always wanted to be that kind of

613
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,520
larger-than-life superwoman but i'm also creating special effects for the camera as sprinkles says

614
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:04,760
glamour offers a strange over-performance of gender signifiers a tenuously woven layer of super

615
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,800
which is so distracting that it successfully hides the transgendered body beneath now a lot of

616
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:17,560
leftist trans people have grown disillusioned with the individual class mobility represented

617
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:23,640
by glamour as well as by transition glow-up narratives and i think that disillusionment

618
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:29,080
and a growing revolutionary sentiment are at the heart of this intense anger and resentment

619
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:34,920
i've noticed a lot of trans women have for drag queens for glamorous trans instagram models and

620
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:42,520
let's be honest for me here's sprinkles one more time as long as an mtf's public acceptance is

621
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:47,480
gauged by her ability to emulate glamorous body and style requirements that elude most

622
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,480
quote real women then i'll have to ask you to pardon this transgendered writer for not feeling

623
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:00,360
represented by rupaul any more than my mother feels represented by marilyn monroe or princess

624
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:05,320
die a lot of trans women are basically fed up with having to serve the world of fantasy

625
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:10,280
all the time they want to be seen for who they are without doing any of that they're fed up

626
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,160
with glamour they're fed up with realness they're fed up with rupaul and a lot of them are pretty

627
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:25,160
fed up with me and i open i open six envy the marxist art critic john berger called glamour

628
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,920
the happiness of being envied being envied is a solitary form of reassurance

629
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,320
it depends precisely upon not sharing your experiences with those who envy you

630
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,840
but being envied is a form of happiness only in the imagination the actual experience of being

631
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:47,880
envied sucks this is the risk of opulence it invites not just enchanted admiration but also

632
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:55,160
envy and where envy goes the guillotine follows or at least vindictive taxation this is why the

633
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,520
experienced rich know to tone down the opulence build a nice high wall around their properties

634
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:05,160
and make a lot of high-profile charitable donations we could call this kind of strategizing

635
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:11,160
the public relations of success it certainly helps to have a rags to riches story especially if you

636
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:16,680
can make other people feel included in some way in your success that's part of the appeal of hip-hop

637
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:22,120
opulence is that it seems to elevate not just a single performer but an entire underclass

638
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:29,320
conversely being perceived as exclusionary elitist or snobbish is going to cost you big in terms of

639
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:35,240
envy management youtube music critic todd in the shadows did a review of ariana grande's song seven

640
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:40,360
rings in which he basically drags ariana who apparently is white for appropriating a bunch

641
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:45,240
of hip-hop rags to riches signifiers without any of the subtext of starting from the bottom

642
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:52,040
she's not showcasing a triumph over adversity she's just a white girl who likes stuff we started

643
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:58,280
from the bottom now the whole team is here so in todd's words the song is a grotesque bullying

644
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,600
vip only privilege flex of a mean girl shoving her wealth in your face i actually like that song but

645
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,560
i'm into that sort of thing bully me mommy oh fellow students as a case study in the public

646
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:17,880
relations of success and envy management let us compare and contrast two successful youtubers

647
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,840
jeffree star and gigi gorgeous there's enough similarities between them for the differences to

648
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:28,360
be interesting they're both lgb and or t they're both white they're both blonde sometimes they're

649
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:34,120
both feminine they're both rich and they both flaunt their opulent lifestyles but nonetheless

650
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:42,440
they seem to like jeffree star whereas gigi well i don't want to say people don't like her but

651
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:48,760
they don't relate to her the best example of this is her 2017 video i wear walmart for a week

652
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:55,480
with its gasp inducing life to dislike ratio let's analyze what went wrong here so for today's video

653
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,080
i thought we would take it to a place i've never been walmart so that's a bad start gorge

654
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:05,400
most americans have been to walmart never having been marks your upbringing as a woman

655
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:11,240
as upper middle class at least treating going to walmart as some kind of challenge kind of comes

656
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:16,280
across as you and your rich friends being like what if we pretend to be poor for a day i wonder

657
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:22,920
if we're gonna see any people at walmart you know that website baby's crying the trauma gigi no you

658
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,200

659
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:34,680

660
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:46,040
gorge what should we get next it's maybe like a gown for a red carpet do they sell gowns here

661
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:52,120
this to me is peak gigi strolling down the aisles of walmart with a two liter bottle of mountain dew

662
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:58,360
that she's plucked from the shelves saying i need something for a red carpet do they have gowns here

663
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:04,920
this to me is an iconic fashion moment this is naive camp this is everything the idea that she

664
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:21,020
is giving people the privilege of a body first

665
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:24,680
this is the second time i've done a close reading of a gg

666
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:29,800
video it's getting kinda weird also why hasn't she answered my letters step on my throat mommy

667
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:34,600
now let's look at jeffree star jeffree does similar kinds of videos to gigi he's even done his own

668
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:34,680
video wearing white and hisété said why do you think you'd do a gg with a bar in black and not an ashley bar on it without a Smackdown Gardener's Stamping her face and then research what you also install as download aproof il Sister

669
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,040
for a day, which people loved. Now my first impulse when explaining the differences in

670
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,760
public perception is to scream sexism. And there's maybe a little of that going on.

671
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,600
I do think a rich woman is more irritating to people than a rich man, but there's clearly more

672
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:54,900
than that going on here. Jeffree's fans are, I assume, mostly women and not rich women,

673
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,780
regular women. The women who work at the dollar store love him. I'm like your biggest fan.

674
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,540
Ordinary people actually enjoy watching Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of designer bags

675
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:09,100
and clothes because they either live vicariously through him or they see him as aspirational.

676
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:14,000
It's the same reason why poor people have always enjoyed watching reality TV shows about the

677
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,600
extremely wealthy. The centerpiece of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's self-made. He represents

678
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:24,040
himself as having started from the bottom. You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing

679
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:29,500
and just generally seems like he hasn't let his wealth go to his head. A good example of this is

680
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:34,280
his private jet Burger King mukbang. Now at first you might think that a private jet is not very

681
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,520
relatable. But it's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not.

682
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:40,760
But the Burger King aspect brings it back down to earth. Jeffree seems like he's been to Burger

683
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:46,220
King before. He's able to order fluently. He's even kind of charming to the cashier. He doesn't

684
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:53,800
like scoff or pinch his nose at anything. Also, the Gucci barrette. Whereas Gigi, I mean, don't

685
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:59,380
get me wrong, I do love Gigi, but I don't know if sis would make it out of Burger King alive.

686
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:04,040
You know, she'd commit some terrible upper-class solacism. Like, I don't know,

687
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,980
not understanding the concept of a value meal. I'm sure Gigi would make an entertaining video,

688
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,660
just not a relatable video. You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis from the toilet seat

689
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:18,800
and do a story time about that. That's really when Gigi's at her best. She kind of comes back

690
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,040
down to earth whenever she's serving real transsexual housewives of Beverly Hills meets

691
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,600
David Cronenberg. So I'm like, I see this white little chiclet in my hand. I'm feeling with my

692
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:33,580
tongue and I'm like, oh my God. Economic inequality in this country has always been

693
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:39,260
controlled by the fact that people basically like the rich. Yeah, we judge people who live

694
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:46,280
in McMansions and we get irritated by elitist out of touch behavior, but ultimately we have no choice

695
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,920
but to stand. And the people we stand the hardest are people like Jeffree Star, who in a way seems

696
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:57,560
like a poor person who just so happens to be very rich. Now, if inequality increases enough,

697
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:03,800
I suspect the standing will stop because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend $69,000 in one trip to

698
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:08,600
a taunt store if what you're doing is fantasizing about what you would buy with that much money.

699
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:13,880
But if you're thinking about how $69,000 could pay off your life-ruining medical debt or about

700
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:18,500
how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments for your dying life, this kind of thing will

701
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:23,780
start getting under your skin. And eventually people will start building guillotines again.

702
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:29,540
In fact, the only way I can imagine a revolution happening in this country is if rich people start

703
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,620
behaving as badly as possible. So this isn't your dream job? No.

704
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,200
You're free, right? Oh, whatever you want. Okay, great.

705
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,560
7. Ruin

706
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:51,620
Good evening, gorge. Ever notice how most vampires are like counts or queens or at least rich? I

707
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:57,560
guess some are edgy biker teens, but I don't associate with that trash. Gothic horror really

708
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:03,440
got started as a genre with 18th and 19th century novels, which were usually set in an old decaying

709
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,500
mansion. By the late 19th century, the aristocracy had lost a lot of its relevance as a class,

710
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:15,560
so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula represented a dying world order and also

711
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,880
maybe the metaphorical bloodsucking of commoners by the landed gentry.

712
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:25,700
Vampires were also usually seducers, and the aristocrat seducer trope had actually played

713
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,860
an important role in turning public opinion against the nobility. So the gothic aesthetic

714
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:33,800
is an aesthetic of dead and decaying opulence.

715
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:39,500
And that aesthetic has evolved over time, from the ruins of a medieval castle to the iconic

716
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:44,660
haunted house, which in American horror is usually a decaying Victorian mansion.

717
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:50,540
It's a trope with an interesting backstory. During the Gilded Age, industrialization produced a new

718
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:56,000
wealthy class of people who built what were essentially 19th century McMansions. When the

719
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,860
Great Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian mansions were abandoned and began to decay,

720
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:03,800
which gave them morbid associations that made

721
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:08,960
them perfect for stories about hauntings and psychos and weirdos.

722
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:16,640
So ruined opulence becomes gothic, which kind of makes you think, we live in an age of opulence

723
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,100
and inequality and growing irritation with abusive men in power, the middle class is shrinking,

724
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:27,920
social unrest is on the rise, it seems like a new economic order could be on the horizon.

725
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,680
When the opulence of our age decays, will there be a new gothic aesthetic of ruined

726
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:37,580
shopping malls? Well, there kind of already is.

727
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:43,580
The urban explorer Dan Bell is a YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series, in which he explores

728
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:48,380
the ruins of abandoned shopping malls, for example, the now demolished Owings Mills Mall

729
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:53,840
just north of Baltimore. The mall opened in 1986 as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.

730
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:00,140
Champagne, gold dust, and pink feathers heralded in a new era for Owings Mills.

731
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,680
Today's opening of the Owings Mills Fashion Mall does not only mean a new,

732
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:09,380
high-fashion place to shop, it also means lots of new developments and jobs for Baltimore County.

733
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:14,840
It had a Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth Avenue. It was a big, high-end mall.

734
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:21,380
But in 1992, a woman who worked as a cleaner at Saks was murdered during an armed robbery on the

735
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,940
trail between the mall and the Baltimore metro station. After the murder, the mall got a

736
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:32,240
reputation for being unsafe, and slowly the stores closed down. Dan recorded two videos at Owings

737
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:33,380
Mills in 2015, when he was working at the Baltimore Metro Station. He said,

738
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:39,920
when only five of the original 155 stores remained, he takes us through the strangely

739
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:48,020
clean and empty halls, the drained fountains, the gutted food court. Watching these videos seems to

740
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:54,440
provoke an emotional response in a lot of people. Some say they feel nostalgic or sad, some express

741
00:44:54,440 --> 00:45:00,560
rage at the waste and futility, some find it creepy or even horrifying, and some have a dark

742
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,960
sense of humor about the absurdity of it all. One commenter said,

743
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:11,480
I think it is still hitting people with slow-motion shock that the 20th century is really over. In the

744
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,900
80s, this looked like the start of a big new world of wealth for everyone. In fact, it was the last

745
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:26,000
gasp of 20th century general prosperity. I agree with all these comments, and I feel every one of

746
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:33,080
these emotions. I think there is a new aesthetic sensibility emerging here, a gothic aesthetic for

747
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:40,640
the 21st century, this decaying opulence that is the carcass of 20th century consumerism. Oh,

748
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,520
it gives me a chill, my nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down my spine.

749
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:55,820
The Owings Mills Mall was totally demolished in late 2016, and Dan's final video about it, we see

750
00:45:55,820 --> 00:46:02,240
clips from his earlier Owings Mills videos intercut with absolutely post-apocalyptic footage of the

751
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,320
half-demolished ruin.

752
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:10,340
It's not like the feeling of exploring a ruined temple or abbey, where you somehow perceive the

753
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:16,520
spiritual significance of the original building. In a dead mall, you do sense the ghosts of the

754
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:23,120
shoppers and the workers, their aspirations and material longings, but what does the crumbling

755
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:30,380
wreckage of a J.C. Penney really mean? That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.

756
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:41,960
All right, comrades, I've said my piece. I'll come quietly. There's no reason to tie me down. I mean,

757
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:50,360
unless you're into that. In which case, by all means. No, I won't resist. I accept my fate.

758
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,380
Why am I even here?

759
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:10,780

786
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:42,340
And let's be honest, definitely a tranny chaser.

787
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:52,540
Gosh, I sure do think I'm funny. But he was an incel and definitely a tranny chaser.

788
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:59,040
Look at me. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of what I've written. Huh?

789
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:04,340
Can't, yeah. But I'm saying his name wrong because I'm an asshole.

790
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,880
I hope you're enjoying this there and watching me rub snot into my hands as I shriek naked in a tub full of jewels.

791
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:15,760
How much leg do we want to get in here? A lot, I assume.

792
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:19,760
I'm just getting oil all over my fur. Great. It's not real fur, whatever.

793
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:23,260
Let me clarify that for the vegans in my comments section.

794
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,480
Ugh, moral people. There's one that I can't stand.

795
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,200
It's people who have some sense of decency.

796
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,980
Okay. Is a hair light really a good idea?

797
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:38,080
Why don't we illuminate my frizziness? Who invented that?

798
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,620
An asshole. But what about a bartender who owns the bar he works in?

799
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:43,800
I guess I'll say shitty to be feminist.

800
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,040
Christ. The demands of these people.

801
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,640
Those bucky teeth, man.

802
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,060
It's like, it's like being tabby. Tabby, tabby.

803
00:48:55,980 --> 00:48:59,020
That is a question that will haunt me.

804
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,660
To the grave.

805
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,560
So happy and stupid.

806
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,180
Okay.
