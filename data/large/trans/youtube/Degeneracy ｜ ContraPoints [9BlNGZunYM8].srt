1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:20,440
Hello, boys!

2
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:24,440
I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not sure what

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,440
that means.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:30,000
I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need is a glorious night of wisdom

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,880
to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man.

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:40,240
Some call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,060
paladin of the Fourth Reich.

8
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,240
But to this priestess of blasphemies, he'll always be the golden one.

9
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:54,240
A young prince, chosen to take the mantle of the ages.

10
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,400
Oh my god.

11
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Look at his butt.

12
00:00:59,400 --> 00:00:59,900
Oh my god.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,800
Daddy, can I have some meat?

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,800
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

15
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,280
Oh daddy.

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,760
You know, Lars, things have really changed since the last time we talked.

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,720
I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chaste since I started my transition,

18
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,240
so in a sense, I'm a virgin.

19
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,680
And I don't know about the rest of these decadent sluts, but I, for one, care about

20
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,660
a little thing called purity.

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:29,020
So now that my decade of gender dysphoric, alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming

22
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:29,880
to a close,

23
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,820
I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master.

24
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,480
But first, let us fend off degeneracy by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water

25
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,280
in pure absinthe.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,680
It's time.

27
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,680
Till now, I've always got my eye on my own.

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,680
I never really cared until I met you.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:08,500
You know, the only thing I care about is being able to experience the same thing I did.

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,580
And I'm glad I can.

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,540
But first, let us fend off this…

32
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
Uh…

33
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,540
What?

34
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,540
Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation?

35
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,540
It is, isn't it?

36
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,540
Well mmmmmm.

37
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,540
They're shiny, and I want them.

38
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,540
It's not my fault Black people have good ideas.

39
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,540
What am I supposed to do?

40
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,540
Not steal them?

41
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:26,880
I'll pop it out.

42
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,680
Alright, thou resplendent champion of the North.

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,680

54
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:04,960
even though you're straight you don't seem super interested in the bodies of the women in your life

55
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:11,120
and this is just a casual suggestion but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like me i'm not

56
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:16,800
like the other girls i've got the t's and the d on second thought leave trans women alone

i don't want that blood on my hands well this is no longer a relaxing bath and that's why we never

58
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,000
bathed with fascists

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:48,000
so

60
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:50,160

so

71
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:53,440
so

so

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,920
so so

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:05:00,520
well i've locked my t i popped my e let's talk about degeneracy what are people talking about

80
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:05,080
when they call something or someone degenerate well let's take a look at some examples from my

81
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:09,960
youtube comments section and see if we can figure it out from context transgender communist

82
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,480
degenerate kill yourself you degenerate tranny freak degen tranny lal trannies grow out of their

83
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:19,320
degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens or at least that's what i would assume since you

84
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:23,800
never see old dudes in dresses lol what's up with that this is degeneracy you ought to be

85
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:31,980
slung from a tree everybody likes to rhyme you little homos our future cannon fodder a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs the end

86
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:37,700
awww these people are trying so hard to upset me they've only got one card in the deck though alas

87
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:48,800
anyway what i'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuck boys is that like a burly nord with his fair maiden the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired with a loathing of queerness

88
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,640
now it's not always just about queerness in fact fascists and social conservatives use the word

89
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:59,900
Degeneracy as a catch-all term to refer to queers, non-whites, communists, communists,

90
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:03,640
people with disabilities, basically anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.

91
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,720
But where does the word Degeneracy come from? Let's watch an instructional video to learn

92
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:08,720
more.

93
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,280
The word Degenerate comes from the Latin prefix

94
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,980
D, which means away from, and the Latin word genus, which means race or kind. So, to be

95
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:24,320
degenerate is to no longer be of your race or kind, and if you think this already sounds

96
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,820
pretty fashy, you've been paying attention.

97
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:31,960
The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian

98
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,540
proto-evolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing

99
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:41,880
colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to Degeneration Theory,

100
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,240
the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.

101
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,960
Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?

102
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,960
The exact same dingbats, yes, and one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat

103
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,840
Arthur de Gabenot, one of the intellectual grandfathers of Nazism. Gabenot wrote a book

104
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,100
called Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed the idea of the

105
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:08,560
Aryan master race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos, and gave the word

106
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,360
degenerate its modern fashy definition.

107
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
Milord?

108
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,680
The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same

109
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,680
intrinsic value as the people themselves.

110
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:19,800
Degenerate.

111
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:26,280
As it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins, continual adulterations

112
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,740
having gradually affected the quality of the blood. In fact, the man of a decadent time,

113
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,900
the degenerate man, properly so called, is a different being from the racial point of

114
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,540
view, from the heroes of the great ages. I think I'm right in concluding that the human

115
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,680
race in all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood.

116
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,740
Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept

117
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:02,000
closely related to degeneracy. Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies

118
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,920
a fall from a previous state of grace. By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence

119
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,740
were everywhere in the European cultural imagination.

120
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,540
During this period, German nationalist composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning

121
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:18,360
Jewishness in music, which he first published under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally

122
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,400
means free thought.

123
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,360
That's right, he pulled the goddamn free speech card.

124
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:32,260
Then the Jewish doctor Max Nordau published a pseudo-medical book called Degeneration,

125
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,080
accusing Wagner and other contemporary artists of degeneracy. And around the same time, a

126
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,940
bunch of queer, absinthe-swilling artists reclaimed the word decadence as the title

127
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,400
of their movement.

128
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,940
Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence. It was 4chan writ large.

129
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,460
So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly true. It's

130
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:48,480
just a myth.

131
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:55,540
Not at all. The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive

132
00:08:55,540 --> 00:09:00,160
goes back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to

133
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,860
speculation about what causes civilizations to decline. And one of the hypotheses was

134
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:10,220
that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence left the Romans vulnerable to butch

135
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,160
Visigoths and Vandals.

136
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,460
Is there any truth to that?

137
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:18,460
No. It's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives. The decadent emperors,

138
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:24,180
Nero, Caligula, Elagabalus, reigned from the 1st to the 3rd centuries. The empire didn't

139
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,480
collapse till the end of the 5th century, which leaves at least 200 years between the

140
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,400
decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was thoroughly Christian. And in

141
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,860
any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand years.

142
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,060
Well, hail Caligula! But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient

143
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,180
civilizations collapsing because of the queers. Here's feminist Camille Poglia on how the

144
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,300
transgenders destroy civilizations.

145
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:56,960
The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting

146
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
to unravel.

147
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Hang on a second. I'm going to need to shift up a gear for this.

148
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:08,700
You can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art. You can

149
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:16,220
see it happening. All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures of handsome

150
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:16,580
nude young men athletes that used to be very role playing. And you can see it happening.

151
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,580
And you can see it happening. All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures

152
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,460
of handsome nude young men athletes that used to be very role playing. And you can see it

153
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,460
happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can

154
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,460
see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And then you

155
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,460
can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And

156
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,460
you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening.

157
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,460
It's very robust, okay, in the archaic period. It suddenly began to seem like wet noodles

158
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,140
towards the end, okay.

159
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:26,700
People who live in such times, okay, feel that they're very sophisticated. They're

160
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:26,960
cosmopolitan.

161
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,060
Domestic divisiveness and yearly

162
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:33,260
And homosexuality, heterosexuality, so on, anything goes and so on.

163
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:39,700
But from the perspective of historical distance, you can see it's a culture that no longer

164
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:46,400
believes in itself. And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power

165
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,100
of heroic blush.

166
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,100
of the power of heroic masculinity, on the edges, whether they're the Vandals or the Huns,

167
00:10:53,100 --> 00:11:00,100
or whether they're the barbarians of ISIS, you see them starting to mass on the upsides of the culture.

168
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:06,100
And that's what we have right now. There is a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect

169
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:14,100
between the infatuation with the transgender movement in our own culture and what's going on out there.

170
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:18,100
I mean, that's why I'm concerned. I feel it's ominous.

171
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:26,100
I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.

172
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:33,100
Riley J. Dennis. Why did you destroy ancient Rome?

173
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:44,100
So the idea is that our infatuation with effeminate decadence means we're going to be destroyed by real men.

174
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,100
You know, like ISIS. This doesn't deserve a response. We're moving on.

175
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,100
Where does fuckin' Nietzsche fit into all of this?

176
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,100
Oh god, do we really have to do this?

177
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,100
So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich N...

178
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,100
who's every edgy 19-year-old's favorite philosopher.

179
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,100
Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets.

180
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Dionysian in the stree... in the... in the...

181
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
Shhhhh. Go to sleep.

182
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western Europe,

183
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,100
and modern culture, especially Christianity, is decadent,

184
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,100
in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society,

185
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:23,100
we have all these hangups about guilt and sin and the afterlife.

186
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,100
And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with people who are weak and sick,

187
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:32,100
and that they repress our basic biological instincts to value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.

188
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,100
In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.

189
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:42,100
There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea of universal human equality

190
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,100
to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryans.

191
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:48,100
And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about, like,

192
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,100
fucking Christian morality, man, and reinstate the cult of Dionysus,

193
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:57,100
which, okay, I'd be down to go to that party, especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.

194
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:08,100
What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism was really kicking into gear,

195
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:12,100
European society was already primed with a couple centuries of degeneracy discourse.

196
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:20,100
Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of National Socialism.

197
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Namely, one, the German people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay.

198
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:33,100
Two, Jews, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, and the disabled are degenerate elements that contribute to decay.

199
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:39,100
And three, the degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure the health and existence of the organism.

200
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,100
So there you have it.

201
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,100
The history of degeneration theory from Foppington to fascism.

202
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc.

203
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:52,100
One particular thing I've noticed about modern fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white babies.

204
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like rats.

205
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,100
And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,

206
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:08,100
including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta male, being a slut,

207
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
being a feminist, not getting married,

208
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,100
not having kids,

209
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
having kids that aren't white,

210
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,100
masturbating,

211
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,100
looking at porn,

212
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
drinking alcohol,

213
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,100
doing drugs,

214
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,100
using birth control,

215
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,100
having abortions.

216
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,100
Condoms and orgies and mass immigration

217
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,100
Malt liquor forties and miscegenation

218
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Boys who use dildos and girls with cock rings

219
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:36,100
These are my favorite degenerate things

220
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Very cute.

221
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
But don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?

222
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.

223
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:50,100
There's like ContraPoint's fans now who watch my videos and look up to me,

224
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,100
so I have to be responsible and I hate it.

225
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:56,100
So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you,

226
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,100
but don't even think about driving, okay?

227
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Drink lots of water and pace yourself.

228
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,100
There's plenty of time to be blackout when you're dead,

229
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.

230
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
Alcohol is dangerous.

231
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
It's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation,

232
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:14,100
and it can put you in really vulnerable situations with really horrible people.

233
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:19,100
So I would never recommend that anyone get involved with alcohol for any reason.

234
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,100
I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good.

235
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Where were we?

236
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,100
Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm

237
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms

238
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,100
Antifa furries and denby drag kings

239
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,100
These are my favorite degenerate things

240
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,100
Hi there.

241
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:59,100
I hope you're having a soothing degenerate bath.

242
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:07,100
What I want you to do is just lie back and try to relax.

243
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:14,100
And I am just going to slowly start to drip

244
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,100
hot candle wax all over you.

245
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
So for fascists and identitarians,

246
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:32,100
anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white procreation is degenerate.

247
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:35,100
And individual fascists differ on what those things are.

248
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate,

249
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:40,100
because apparently gay people can't raise children.

250
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,100
Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one subservient white woman

251
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,100
because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning out clean-cut heterosexual white kids.

252
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,100
And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get basic social conservatism.

253
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
So this really isn't just about fascism,

254
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,100
though I do like to talk about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles.

255
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:05,100
Speaking of which, a lot of rightists have realized that in the 21st century,

256
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:08,100
the social conservative position is not very cool.

257
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:12,100
So what they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals,

258
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,100
what they have a problem with is the gay agenda.

259
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,100
What they have a problem with, essentially, is queerness.

260
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Now, what is queerness?

261
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this,

262
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:27,100
but in its most generic sense, queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing.

263
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,100
So either your gender is all fucked up, or you have creative tastes and sexual partners.

264
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:34,100
But unlike the words homosexual or transgender,

265
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:37,100
queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion,

266
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:43,100
often rebellion against the heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.

267
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:48,100
So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and transgender people,

268
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:54,100
but only if you shut up about it, conform to straight society, and try to act as normal as possible.

269
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:58,100
What they can't stand is loud nonconformist queerness, because think of the children.

270
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:03,100
We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks,

271
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
gangsters, polyamorists, sing it with me,

272
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:10,100
these are my favorite degenerate things.

273
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:16,100
To fascists, the pursuit of individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race.

274
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:21,100
So in a sense, traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism,

275
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:24,100
which only demands the communal ownership of the means of production.

276
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:29,100
At least in theory, communism doesn't tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck.

277
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,100
In practice, though, there's not a single position on the political spectrum

278
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
that's immune to complaining about degeneracy.

279
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,100
While I was researching this video, I randomly came across an article

280
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:41,100
from an American communist newspaper from 1976 that claims,

281
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:45,100
While we communists suppose attacks on anyone by the bourgeoisie, including homosexuals,

282
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,100
we do not uphold homosexuality as a democratic right.

283
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:53,100
Homosexuality is a form of social sickness, a form of social perversion.

284
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:58,100
It is a form of bourgeois ideology, which appeals especially to the petty bourgeoisie

285
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,100
because of its appearance as sexual freedom.

286
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:05,100
Homosexuality arose from class oppression and the oppression of women.

287
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Geez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh?

288
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:12,100
We've got the fascists calling us sexual Bolshevists,

289
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:15,100
and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.

290
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,100
Why does everyone hate decadence so much?

291
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:20,100
Is pleasure really so wrong?

292
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:49,100
Listen, I don't want my position to be misunderstood.

293
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,100
I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and procreative.

294
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,100
And you know, that's probably for the best.

295
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,100
Someone needs to have the babies and keep society running.

296
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,100
All we gentle decadents ask is,

297
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:04,100
to be allowed to enjoy our special delights and peace.

298
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:07,100
My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind.

299
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:11,100
In the perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around,

300
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
so don't you worry about that.

301
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:15,100
And that's the difference between me and the fascists.

302
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,100
I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist.

303
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:22,100
And, this is the important part, where people not like me are simply allowed to exist.

304
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist.

305
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
The queer quest is to survive.

306
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
The fascist quest is to be the only survivor.

307
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence of priests,

308
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,100
which is to say, bejeweled men in dresses who have no children

309
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,100
and are a giant tax-exempt drain on the economy.

310
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,100
Well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who crack Nazi codes

311
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,100
and write you musicals and sing you songs.

312
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,100
So if you think the meaning of life is to create as many white babies as possible,

313
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,100
you know what? Fine. Go make white babies.

314
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,100
But I really must insist upon my right, and the right of all degenerates,

315
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:58,100
to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities

316
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
of race mixing, sexual anarchy, and rock and roll.

317
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,100
Rock and roll.

318
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,100
Rock on gold dust woman

319
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,100
Take your silver spoon

320
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:16,100
Take your grave

321
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,100
Wake up in the morning

322
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,100
See your sunrise loves to go down

323
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:39,100
Lousy lovers pick their prey

324
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:44,100
But they never cry out loud

325
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:48,100
Cry out

326
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Well, did she make you cry?

327
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Make you break down?

328
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,100
Shatter your illusions of love?

329
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Tell me, is it over now?

330
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go?

331
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:08,100
Oh, yeah.

332
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:11,100
Rock on ancient queen

333
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:19,100
Follow those who fell in your shadow

334
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,100
That was dagged up.

335
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:25,100
Rulers make bad lovers

336
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,100
You better put your kingdom up for sale.

337
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:32,100
One more time.

338
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,100
Oh, did she make you cry?

339
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,100
Make you break down?

340
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
Shatter your illusions of love?

341
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,100
Well, tell me, is it over now?

342
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,100
Do you know how

343
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,100
To pick up the pieces and go?

344
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:56,100
Rock and roll.

345
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Rock on gold dust woman

346
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,980
Take your silver spoon

347
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,100
Take your silver spoon

348
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,540
Pick up your grave
