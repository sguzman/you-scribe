00:00.000 --> 00:20.440
Hello, boys!

00:20.440 --> 00:24.440
I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not sure what

00:24.440 --> 00:25.440
that means.

00:25.440 --> 00:30.000
I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need is a glorious night of wisdom

00:30.000 --> 00:33.880
to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man.

00:33.880 --> 00:40.240
Some call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant

00:40.240 --> 00:42.060
paladin of the Fourth Reich.

00:42.060 --> 00:46.240
But to this priestess of blasphemies, he'll always be the golden one.

00:46.240 --> 00:54.240
A young prince, chosen to take the mantle of the ages.

00:54.240 --> 00:58.400
Oh my god.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.400
Look at his butt.

00:59.400 --> 00:59.900
Oh my god.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.800
Daddy, can I have some meat?

01:03.800 --> 01:06.800
Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.280
Oh daddy.

01:08.280 --> 01:11.760
You know, Lars, things have really changed since the last time we talked.

01:11.760 --> 01:16.720
I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chaste since I started my transition,

01:16.720 --> 01:19.240
so in a sense, I'm a virgin.

01:19.240 --> 01:22.680
And I don't know about the rest of these decadent sluts, but I, for one, care about

01:22.680 --> 01:24.660
a little thing called purity.

01:24.660 --> 01:29.020
So now that my decade of gender dysphoric, alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming

01:29.020 --> 01:29.880
to a close,

01:29.880 --> 01:32.820
I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master.

01:32.820 --> 01:37.480
But first, let us fend off degeneracy by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water

01:37.480 --> 01:39.280
in pure absinthe.

01:39.280 --> 01:40.680
It's time.

01:40.680 --> 01:46.680
Till now, I've always got my eye on my own.

01:46.680 --> 01:51.680
I never really cared until I met you.

01:59.880 --> 02:08.500
You know, the only thing I care about is being able to experience the same thing I did.

02:08.500 --> 02:12.580
And I'm glad I can.

02:12.580 --> 02:15.540
But first, let us fend off this…

02:15.540 --> 02:16.540
Uh…

02:16.540 --> 02:17.540
What?

02:17.540 --> 02:18.540
Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation?

02:18.540 --> 02:19.540
It is, isn't it?

02:19.540 --> 02:20.540
Well mmmmmm.

02:20.540 --> 02:21.540
They're shiny, and I want them.

02:21.540 --> 02:22.540
It's not my fault Black people have good ideas.

02:22.540 --> 02:23.540
What am I supposed to do?

02:23.540 --> 02:24.540
Not steal them?

02:24.540 --> 02:26.880
I'll pop it out.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.680
Alright, thou resplendent champion of the North.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.680
Hit me with the upstart!

02:29.680 --> 02:37.760
with your finest wisdom i'm gonna go train some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror that's

02:37.760 --> 02:48.480

03:59.520 --> 04:04.960
even though you're straight you don't seem super interested in the bodies of the women in your life

04:04.960 --> 04:11.120
and this is just a casual suggestion but maybe what you want is a fair maiden like me i'm not

04:11.120 --> 04:16.800
like the other girls i've got the t's and the d on second thought leave trans women alone

04:16.800 --> 04:23.920
i don't want that blood on my hands well this is no longer a relaxing bath and that's why we never

04:23.920 --> 04:28.000
bathed with fascists

04:36.160 --> 04:48.000
so

04:50.080 --> 04:50.160
so

04:50.160 --> 04:52.160
so

04:52.160 --> 04:52.240
so

04:52.240 --> 04:53.280
so

04:53.280 --> 04:53.300
so

04:53.300 --> 04:53.320
so

04:53.320 --> 04:53.340
so

04:53.340 --> 04:53.360
so

04:53.360 --> 04:53.380
so

04:53.380 --> 04:53.400
so

04:53.400 --> 04:53.420
so

04:53.420 --> 04:53.440
so

04:53.440 --> 04:53.460
so

04:53.460 --> 04:53.480
so

04:53.480 --> 04:53.500
so

04:53.500 --> 04:53.520
so

04:53.520 --> 04:53.540
so

04:53.540 --> 04:53.640
so

04:53.920 --> 04:54.920
so so

04:54.920 --> 05:00.520
well i've locked my t i popped my e let's talk about degeneracy what are people talking about

05:00.520 --> 05:05.080
when they call something or someone degenerate well let's take a look at some examples from my

05:05.080 --> 05:09.960
youtube comments section and see if we can figure it out from context transgender communist

05:09.960 --> 05:15.480
degenerate kill yourself you degenerate tranny freak degen tranny lal trannies grow out of their

05:15.480 --> 05:19.320
degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens or at least that's what i would assume since you

05:19.320 --> 05:23.800
never see old dudes in dresses lol what's up with that this is degeneracy you ought to be

05:23.800 --> 05:31.980
slung from a tree everybody likes to rhyme you little homos our future cannon fodder a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs the end

05:31.980 --> 05:37.700
awww these people are trying so hard to upset me they've only got one card in the deck though alas

05:37.700 --> 05:48.800
anyway what i'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuck boys is that like a burly nord with his fair maiden the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired with a loathing of queerness

05:48.800 --> 05:53.640
now it's not always just about queerness in fact fascists and social conservatives use the word

05:53.640 --> 05:59.900
Degeneracy as a catch-all term to refer to queers, non-whites, communists, communists,

05:59.900 --> 06:03.640
people with disabilities, basically anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.720
But where does the word Degeneracy come from? Let's watch an instructional video to learn

06:07.720 --> 06:08.720
more.

06:08.720 --> 06:14.280
The word Degenerate comes from the Latin prefix

06:14.280 --> 06:19.980
D, which means away from, and the Latin word genus, which means race or kind. So, to be

06:19.980 --> 06:24.320
degenerate is to no longer be of your race or kind, and if you think this already sounds

06:24.320 --> 06:26.820
pretty fashy, you've been paying attention.

06:26.820 --> 06:31.960
The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian

06:31.960 --> 06:36.540
proto-evolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing

06:36.540 --> 06:41.880
colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to Degeneration Theory,

06:41.880 --> 06:46.240
the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.

06:46.240 --> 06:49.960
Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?

06:49.960 --> 06:54.960
The exact same dingbats, yes, and one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat

06:54.960 --> 06:59.840
Arthur de Gabenot, one of the intellectual grandfathers of Nazism. Gabenot wrote a book

06:59.840 --> 07:04.100
called Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed the idea of the

07:04.100 --> 07:08.560
Aryan master race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos, and gave the word

07:08.560 --> 07:11.360
degenerate its modern fashy definition.

07:11.360 --> 07:12.360
Milord?

07:12.360 --> 07:18.680
The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same

07:18.680 --> 07:19.680
intrinsic value as the people themselves.

07:19.680 --> 07:19.800
Degenerate.

07:19.960 --> 07:26.280
As it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins, continual adulterations

07:26.280 --> 07:32.740
having gradually affected the quality of the blood. In fact, the man of a decadent time,

07:32.740 --> 07:37.900
the degenerate man, properly so called, is a different being from the racial point of

07:37.900 --> 07:43.540
view, from the heroes of the great ages. I think I'm right in concluding that the human

07:43.540 --> 07:49.680
race in all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood.

07:49.680 --> 07:55.740
Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept

07:55.740 --> 08:02.000
closely related to degeneracy. Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies

08:02.000 --> 08:06.920
a fall from a previous state of grace. By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence

08:06.920 --> 08:09.740
were everywhere in the European cultural imagination.

08:09.740 --> 08:13.540
During this period, German nationalist composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning

08:13.540 --> 08:18.360
Jewishness in music, which he first published under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally

08:18.360 --> 08:19.400
means free thought.

08:19.400 --> 08:22.360
That's right, he pulled the goddamn free speech card.

08:27.460 --> 08:32.260
Then the Jewish doctor Max Nordau published a pseudo-medical book called Degeneration,

08:32.260 --> 08:36.080
accusing Wagner and other contemporary artists of degeneracy. And around the same time, a

08:36.080 --> 08:39.940
bunch of queer, absinthe-swilling artists reclaimed the word decadence as the title

08:39.940 --> 08:41.400
of their movement.

08:41.400 --> 08:45.940
Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence. It was 4chan writ large.

08:45.940 --> 08:48.460
So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly true. It's

08:48.460 --> 08:48.480
just a myth.

08:49.400 --> 08:55.540
Not at all. The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive

08:55.540 --> 09:00.160
goes back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to

09:00.160 --> 09:04.860
speculation about what causes civilizations to decline. And one of the hypotheses was

09:04.860 --> 09:10.220
that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence left the Romans vulnerable to butch

09:10.220 --> 09:12.160
Visigoths and Vandals.

09:12.160 --> 09:13.460
Is there any truth to that?

09:13.460 --> 09:18.460
No. It's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives. The decadent emperors,

09:18.460 --> 09:24.180
Nero, Caligula, Elagabalus, reigned from the 1st to the 3rd centuries. The empire didn't

09:24.180 --> 09:27.480
collapse till the end of the 5th century, which leaves at least 200 years between the

09:27.480 --> 09:31.400
decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was thoroughly Christian. And in

09:31.400 --> 09:35.860
any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand years.

09:35.860 --> 09:41.060
Well, hail Caligula! But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient

09:41.060 --> 09:46.180
civilizations collapsing because of the queers. Here's feminist Camille Poglia on how the

09:46.180 --> 09:48.300
transgenders destroy civilizations.

09:48.460 --> 09:56.960
The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting

09:56.960 --> 09:57.960
to unravel.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.960
Hang on a second. I'm going to need to shift up a gear for this.

10:01.960 --> 10:08.700
You can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art. You can

10:08.700 --> 10:16.220
see it happening. All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures of handsome

10:16.220 --> 10:16.580
nude young men athletes that used to be very role playing. And you can see it happening.

10:16.580 --> 10:17.580
And you can see it happening. All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures

10:17.580 --> 10:18.460
of handsome nude young men athletes that used to be very role playing. And you can see it

10:18.460 --> 10:19.460
happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can

10:19.460 --> 10:20.460
see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And then you

10:20.460 --> 10:21.460
can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And

10:21.460 --> 10:22.460
you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening.

10:22.460 --> 10:23.460
It's very robust, okay, in the archaic period. It suddenly began to seem like wet noodles

10:23.460 --> 10:24.140
towards the end, okay.

10:24.140 --> 10:26.700
People who live in such times, okay, feel that they're very sophisticated. They're

10:26.700 --> 10:26.960
cosmopolitan.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.060
Domestic divisiveness and yearly

10:29.060 --> 10:33.260
And homosexuality, heterosexuality, so on, anything goes and so on.

10:33.260 --> 10:39.700
But from the perspective of historical distance, you can see it's a culture that no longer

10:39.700 --> 10:46.400
believes in itself. And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power

10:46.400 --> 10:47.100
of heroic blush.

10:47.100 --> 10:53.100
of the power of heroic masculinity, on the edges, whether they're the Vandals or the Huns,

10:53.100 --> 11:00.100
or whether they're the barbarians of ISIS, you see them starting to mass on the upsides of the culture.

11:00.100 --> 11:06.100
And that's what we have right now. There is a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect

11:06.100 --> 11:14.100
between the infatuation with the transgender movement in our own culture and what's going on out there.

11:14.100 --> 11:18.100
I mean, that's why I'm concerned. I feel it's ominous.

11:18.100 --> 11:26.100
I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.

11:28.100 --> 11:33.100
Riley J. Dennis. Why did you destroy ancient Rome?

11:38.100 --> 11:44.100
So the idea is that our infatuation with effeminate decadence means we're going to be destroyed by real men.

11:44.100 --> 11:49.100
You know, like ISIS. This doesn't deserve a response. We're moving on.

11:49.100 --> 11:52.100
Where does fuckin' Nietzsche fit into all of this?

11:52.100 --> 11:55.100
Oh god, do we really have to do this?

11:55.100 --> 11:59.100
So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich N...

11:59.100 --> 12:02.100
who's every edgy 19-year-old's favorite philosopher.

12:02.100 --> 12:06.100
Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.100
Dionysian in the stree... in the... in the...

12:09.100 --> 12:11.100
Shhhhh. Go to sleep.

12:11.100 --> 12:14.100
Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western Europe,

12:14.100 --> 12:17.100
and modern culture, especially Christianity, is decadent,

12:17.100 --> 12:20.100
in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society,

12:20.100 --> 12:23.100
we have all these hangups about guilt and sin and the afterlife.

12:23.100 --> 12:27.100
And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with people who are weak and sick,

12:27.100 --> 12:32.100
and that they repress our basic biological instincts to value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.

12:32.100 --> 12:36.100
In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.

12:36.100 --> 12:42.100
There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea of universal human equality

12:42.100 --> 12:44.100
to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryans.

12:44.100 --> 12:48.100
And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about, like,

12:48.100 --> 12:52.100
fucking Christian morality, man, and reinstate the cult of Dionysus,

12:52.100 --> 12:57.100
which, okay, I'd be down to go to that party, especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.

13:02.100 --> 13:08.100
What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism was really kicking into gear,

13:08.100 --> 13:12.100
European society was already primed with a couple centuries of degeneracy discourse.

13:12.100 --> 13:20.100
Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of National Socialism.

13:20.100 --> 13:26.100
Namely, one, the German people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay.

13:26.100 --> 13:33.100
Two, Jews, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, and the disabled are degenerate elements that contribute to decay.

13:33.100 --> 13:39.100
And three, the degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure the health and existence of the organism.

13:39.100 --> 13:40.100
So there you have it.

13:40.100 --> 13:43.100
The history of degeneration theory from Foppington to fascism.

13:43.100 --> 13:45.100
Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc.

13:45.100 --> 13:52.100
One particular thing I've noticed about modern fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white babies.

13:52.100 --> 13:56.100
Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like rats.

13:56.100 --> 14:00.100
And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,

14:00.100 --> 14:08.100
including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta male, being a slut,

14:08.100 --> 14:10.100
being a feminist, not getting married,

14:10.100 --> 14:11.100
not having kids,

14:11.100 --> 14:12.100
having kids that aren't white,

14:12.100 --> 14:13.100
masturbating,

14:13.100 --> 14:14.100
looking at porn,

14:14.100 --> 14:15.100
drinking alcohol,

14:15.100 --> 14:16.100
doing drugs,

14:16.100 --> 14:17.100
using birth control,

14:17.100 --> 14:19.100
having abortions.

14:21.100 --> 14:24.100
Condoms and orgies and mass immigration

14:24.100 --> 14:28.100
Malt liquor forties and miscegenation

14:28.100 --> 14:31.100
Boys who use dildos and girls with cock rings

14:31.100 --> 14:36.100
These are my favorite degenerate things

14:36.100 --> 14:37.100
Very cute.

14:37.100 --> 14:39.100
But don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?

14:39.100 --> 14:43.100
Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.

14:46.100 --> 14:50.100
There's like ContraPoint's fans now who watch my videos and look up to me,

14:50.100 --> 14:53.100
so I have to be responsible and I hate it.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.100
So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you,

14:56.100 --> 14:59.100
but don't even think about driving, okay?

14:59.100 --> 15:02.100
Drink lots of water and pace yourself.

15:02.100 --> 15:04.100
There's plenty of time to be blackout when you're dead,

15:04.100 --> 15:06.100
and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.

15:06.100 --> 15:08.100
Alcohol is dangerous.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.100
It's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation,

15:10.100 --> 15:14.100
and it can put you in really vulnerable situations with really horrible people.

15:14.100 --> 15:19.100
So I would never recommend that anyone get involved with alcohol for any reason.

15:21.100 --> 15:24.100
I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good.

15:24.100 --> 15:26.100
Where were we?

15:28.100 --> 15:31.100
Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm

15:31.100 --> 15:35.100
Estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms

15:35.100 --> 15:38.100
Antifa furries and denby drag kings

15:38.100 --> 15:43.100
These are my favorite degenerate things

15:50.100 --> 15:52.100
Hi there.

15:52.100 --> 15:59.100
I hope you're having a soothing degenerate bath.

16:00.100 --> 16:07.100
What I want you to do is just lie back and try to relax.

16:08.100 --> 16:14.100
And I am just going to slowly start to drip

16:14.100 --> 16:18.100
hot candle wax all over you.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.100
So for fascists and identitarians,

16:28.100 --> 16:32.100
anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white procreation is degenerate.

16:32.100 --> 16:35.100
And individual fascists differ on what those things are.

16:35.100 --> 16:37.100
Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate,

16:37.100 --> 16:40.100
because apparently gay people can't raise children.

16:40.100 --> 16:45.100
Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one subservient white woman

16:45.100 --> 16:50.100
because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning out clean-cut heterosexual white kids.

16:50.100 --> 16:54.100
And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get basic social conservatism.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.100
So this really isn't just about fascism,

16:57.100 --> 17:01.100
though I do like to talk about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles.

17:01.100 --> 17:05.100
Speaking of which, a lot of rightists have realized that in the 21st century,

17:05.100 --> 17:08.100
the social conservative position is not very cool.

17:08.100 --> 17:12.100
So what they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals,

17:12.100 --> 17:15.100
what they have a problem with is the gay agenda.

17:15.100 --> 17:18.100
What they have a problem with, essentially, is queerness.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.100
Now, what is queerness?

17:20.100 --> 17:23.100
Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this,

17:23.100 --> 17:27.100
but in its most generic sense, queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing.

17:27.100 --> 17:31.100
So either your gender is all fucked up, or you have creative tastes and sexual partners.

17:31.100 --> 17:34.100
But unlike the words homosexual or transgender,

17:34.100 --> 17:37.100
queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion,

17:37.100 --> 17:43.100
often rebellion against the heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.

17:43.100 --> 17:48.100
So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and transgender people,

17:48.100 --> 17:54.100
but only if you shut up about it, conform to straight society, and try to act as normal as possible.

17:54.100 --> 17:58.100
What they can't stand is loud nonconformist queerness, because think of the children.

17:58.100 --> 18:03.100
We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks,

18:03.100 --> 18:06.100
gangsters, polyamorists, sing it with me,

18:06.100 --> 18:10.100
these are my favorite degenerate things.

18:10.100 --> 18:16.100
To fascists, the pursuit of individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race.

18:16.100 --> 18:21.100
So in a sense, traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism,

18:21.100 --> 18:24.100
which only demands the communal ownership of the means of production.

18:24.100 --> 18:29.100
At least in theory, communism doesn't tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.100
In practice, though, there's not a single position on the political spectrum

18:32.100 --> 18:34.100
that's immune to complaining about degeneracy.

18:34.100 --> 18:37.100
While I was researching this video, I randomly came across an article

18:37.100 --> 18:41.100
from an American communist newspaper from 1976 that claims,

18:41.100 --> 18:45.100
While we communists suppose attacks on anyone by the bourgeoisie, including homosexuals,

18:45.100 --> 18:48.100
we do not uphold homosexuality as a democratic right.

18:48.100 --> 18:53.100
Homosexuality is a form of social sickness, a form of social perversion.

18:53.100 --> 18:58.100
It is a form of bourgeois ideology, which appeals especially to the petty bourgeoisie

18:58.100 --> 19:01.100
because of its appearance as sexual freedom.

19:01.100 --> 19:05.100
Homosexuality arose from class oppression and the oppression of women.

19:05.100 --> 19:09.100
Geez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh?

19:09.100 --> 19:12.100
We've got the fascists calling us sexual Bolshevists,

19:12.100 --> 19:15.100
and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.

19:15.100 --> 19:17.100
Why does everyone hate decadence so much?

19:17.100 --> 19:20.100
Is pleasure really so wrong?

19:31.100 --> 19:49.100
Listen, I don't want my position to be misunderstood.

19:49.100 --> 19:54.100
I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and procreative.

19:54.100 --> 19:56.100
And you know, that's probably for the best.

19:56.100 --> 19:59.100
Someone needs to have the babies and keep society running.

19:59.100 --> 20:01.100
All we gentle decadents ask is,

20:01.100 --> 20:04.100
to be allowed to enjoy our special delights and peace.

20:04.100 --> 20:07.100
My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind.

20:07.100 --> 20:11.100
In the perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around,

20:11.100 --> 20:12.100
so don't you worry about that.

20:12.100 --> 20:15.100
And that's the difference between me and the fascists.

20:15.100 --> 20:18.100
I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist.

20:18.100 --> 20:22.100
And, this is the important part, where people not like me are simply allowed to exist.

20:22.100 --> 20:26.100
Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.100
The queer quest is to survive.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.100
The fascist quest is to be the only survivor.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.100
Society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence of priests,

20:34.100 --> 20:37.100
which is to say, bejeweled men in dresses who have no children

20:37.100 --> 20:39.100
and are a giant tax-exempt drain on the economy.

20:39.100 --> 20:43.100
Well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who crack Nazi codes

20:43.100 --> 20:45.100
and write you musicals and sing you songs.

20:45.100 --> 20:49.100
So if you think the meaning of life is to create as many white babies as possible,

20:49.100 --> 20:52.100
you know what? Fine. Go make white babies.

20:52.100 --> 20:55.100
But I really must insist upon my right, and the right of all degenerates,

20:55.100 --> 20:58.100
to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities

20:58.100 --> 21:00.100
of race mixing, sexual anarchy, and rock and roll.

21:01.100 --> 21:05.100
Rock and roll.

21:05.100 --> 21:10.100
Rock on gold dust woman

21:10.100 --> 21:13.100
Take your silver spoon

21:13.100 --> 21:16.100
Take your grave

21:20.100 --> 21:24.100
Wake up in the morning

21:24.100 --> 21:29.100
See your sunrise loves to go down

21:31.100 --> 21:39.100
Lousy lovers pick their prey

21:39.100 --> 21:44.100
But they never cry out loud

21:44.100 --> 21:48.100
Cry out

21:48.100 --> 21:50.100
Well, did she make you cry?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.100
Make you break down?

21:52.100 --> 21:54.100
Shatter your illusions of love?

21:54.100 --> 21:57.100
Tell me, is it over now?

21:57.100 --> 22:00.100
Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go?

22:00.100 --> 22:08.100
Oh, yeah.

22:08.100 --> 22:11.100
Rock on ancient queen

22:11.100 --> 22:19.100
Follow those who fell in your shadow

22:19.100 --> 22:21.100
That was dagged up.

22:21.100 --> 22:25.100
Rulers make bad lovers

22:25.100 --> 22:28.100
You better put your kingdom up for sale.

22:28.100 --> 22:32.100
One more time.

22:32.100 --> 22:35.100
Oh, did she make you cry?

22:35.100 --> 22:37.100
Make you break down?

22:37.100 --> 22:39.100
Shatter your illusions of love?

22:39.100 --> 22:42.100
Well, tell me, is it over now?

22:42.100 --> 22:45.100
Do you know how

22:45.100 --> 22:49.100
To pick up the pieces and go?

22:49.100 --> 22:56.100
Rock and roll.

22:58.100 --> 23:01.100
Rock on gold dust woman

23:01.100 --> 23:02.980
Take your silver spoon

23:02.980 --> 23:04.100
Take your silver spoon

23:04.100 --> 23:05.540
Pick up your grave
