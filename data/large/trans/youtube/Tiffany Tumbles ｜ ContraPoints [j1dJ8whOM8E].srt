00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,720
Hi guys! It's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube sensation. Welcome to my world! Every

2
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:19,280
week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials. Come get ready with me! So I'm going to go in

3
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:26,240
with the color Snowflake from my Winter Rose palette using a flaunt 325 brush. Smoke it out.

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,560
Do you want to just kind of judge it? That looks bomb. It's major. I'm vibing it. I'm obsessed.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:43,360
It's literally snatched. Love, love, love. Yes. Okay. I'm not living for it. Oh my god.

6
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:50,560
I think I glued my eyes shut. Fuck. But I'm not just a pretty face. I also share plenty

7
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,040
of opinions about controversial social and political issues. Even though I'm trans,

8
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,240
I refuse to be.

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:01,760
a victim because I prefer to take control of my own life, which is why I support our president,

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,560
Donald J. Trump. Make traps gay again. Bye!

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,000
Hi! I'm Jackie

12
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,320
Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, where- I'm sorry, why does my studio look like a Japanese

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:39,760
drag queen redecorated an Italian bordello? It's hard to move past it. Anyway, tonight my guests

14
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:44,400
are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political spectrum, but I've brought them

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,120
here together to engage in a rational, free-thinking debate about a timeless question.

16
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,920
Are traps gay?

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,120
First guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series Intersectional AF.

18
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,640
Clarence?

19
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,400
Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria. Have you ever considered that transphobia is racist?

20
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,960
Okay. My other guest is returning to the show. It's Tiffany Tumbles. Now, Tiffany,

21
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,800
you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this program, isn't that right?

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,440
That's right, Jackie. It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,080
You poor thing. Could you say a little bit about how you came-

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,840
I came to take the red pill.

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,120
Well, I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders,

26
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:36,160
and how I was tired of trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans,

27
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,120
and next thing I know, everyone's calling me a TERF and a traitor, so I said, you know what?

28
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,720
I'm out. I'm not gonna put up with this culture of silencing and shame.

29
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,200
I think that's just so brave of you.

30
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,520
Yeah, wow, so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are.

31
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,000
Shut up, Adria. I had just come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online.

32
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,520
And then like that, the trans community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support. Nothing.

33
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,040
I was absolutely alone. Do you have any idea what that felt like?

34
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,760
Your leftist allies are not your friends, Adria. One wrong move and you're dead to them.

35
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,880
Those are not friends.

36
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,120
Well, you have real friends now, Tiffany.

37
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,880
I think you're gonna fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals

38
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,920
who are finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left

39
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,720
and speaking out against politically correct dogma.

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,520
Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,680
So I'm gonna go in with a highlighter, pop it on my cheeks,

42
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:34,400
pop it on my brow till I'm literally blinding.

43
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,760
I am glowing.

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,840
She's doing all right, but I'm not living for it.

45
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,320
You know what else I'm not living for?

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,960
The Muslims.

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,360
Tiffany, you are so funny.

48
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry, are we just gonna ignore the blatant racism?

49
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,120
How is that racist?

50
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,880
Muslims are a religion, not a race.

51
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,680
Yeah, Adria, Muslims are a religion, not a race.

52
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,960
Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied together.

53
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,600
You can't just...

54
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
Look, you both know exactly what I'm talking about.

55
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,240
Let's try to get back on track here.

56
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,880
So, Adria, traps.

57
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,800
Are they gay?

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Look, there's so many things wrong with the question

59
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,280
that the only way to answer it is to deconstruct it.

60
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,040
First of all, what are traps?

61
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,160
Are they trans women?

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,920
Because if you're calling trans women traps,

63
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,160
then you're directly playing into the lie that trans women are tricking or trapping men.

64
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,520
A lie that reinforces the mentality that causes men to murder us.

65
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,320
Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman.

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,440
What about anime?

67
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,040
Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans.

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,640
The Japanese word is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser.

69
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,640
There's no implication of tricking men.

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:42,720
But the word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women.

71
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
So when you tell us that's not what it means,

72
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,840
you're gaslighting the shit out of us because we've all heard it used as a slur.

73
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,080
Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women.

74
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,080
We're not all offended all the time.

75
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,320
I actually happen to identify as a trap.

76
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
Yeah, Adria, she identifies.

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
She identifies as a trap.

78
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
Well, she's in the sunken place.

79
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,400
And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless.

80
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,720
Doesn't it bother you at all that if some guy murders you,

81
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,760
his defense is gonna be,

82
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,920
well, she was a trap, I was tricked.

83
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,840
And you'll have contributed to that way of thinking.

84
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,280
Well, what do you care, Adria?

85
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,200
No one's gonna be trapped by you anyway.

86
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,560
Oh, spicy.

87
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,920
The fuck did you just say?

88
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,200
I said, no shade, but you don't really look like a woman.

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,080
Jackie, are you gonna allow your guest to talk to me like this?

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,800
Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer.

91
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,520
Look, dragging bitches is what I do.

92
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,200
Facts over feels, hunty.

93
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,760
Well, Adria, don't you think she has a bit of a point?

94
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,600
Like, if you wanna be taken seriously,

95
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,280
you could put a little more effort in.

96
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,440
I mean, what is this, a men's shirt?

97
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,520
How are you gonna attract men with that?

98
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,520
I'm not trying to attract men.

99
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,560
I'm a lesbian.

100
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,040
I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question,

101
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,800
but how can you be a trans woman and a lesbian?

102
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,840
Well, I'm a woman and I like women.

103
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,200
I don't know about that.

104
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,160
Sounds debatable.

105
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show

106
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,280
that I was signing up

107
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,800
for the transphobia special.

108
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,400
Transphobia?

109
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,720
Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair.

110
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,240
I mean, I've invited two trans women to be on my program

111
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
and I'll have you know that one of my best friends

112
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,480
happens to be a gay man.

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,040
And what could be transphobic about that?

114
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,480
See, Adria, you're the reason

115
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,160
why everyone hates trans people.

116
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
You're obnoxious and offended by everything

117
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
and everyone feels like they have to tread

118
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,720
on eggshells around you.

119
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,760
Thank you, Tiffany.

120
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,280
See, you're one of the good ones.

121
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,320
You're a good trans.

122
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,480
Is this what you wanna do with your life, Tiffany?

123
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,200
Be the laptop?

124
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,640
Dog of people like this?

125
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,200
No.

126
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,920
I wanna actually work toward the acceptance of trans people

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,840
by being patient and agreeable

128
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,040
and by looking the part

129
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,800
and not by screeching transphobia

130
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,680
at everyone who doesn't meet

131
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,440
your impossible standard of wokeness.

132
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,160
And you're gonna do that by identifying as a trap, huh?

133
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,400
Just keep reinforcing and excusing bigotry

134
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,840
until it magically goes away.

135
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,280
Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany,

136
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,560
that you're not gaining acceptance

137
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
for anyone but yourself

138
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,200
and the only reason you're accepted

139
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,960
is that you don't challenge the status quo?

140
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,720
because I feel like we're just getting hung up

142
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,000
on terminology.

143
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
Look, Adria, if you don't like the word trap,

144
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,680
we just won't use the word trap.

145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,960
The real question is,

146
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,280
is it gay to be attracted to trans women?

147
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,320
It is if you're a woman.

148
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,920
No, I mean for men.

149
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,120
Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men or gay men?

150
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,760
Well, all the men I've dated only date women,

151
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,680
but if they're attracted to me,

152
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
I mean, it's not the straightest thing, is it?

153
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,440
Why not?

154
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,000
You look like a woman and I know that you know

155
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,240
that gay men are not attracted to these tits.

156
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,560
Well, I am serving up fishy realness.

157
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
So, granted.

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,760
Well, doesn't she have a point, though, Adria?

159
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,920
I mean, sure, she looks like a woman,

160
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,480
but she does have XY chromosomes.

161
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,000
When was the last time you were attracted

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
to a person's chromosomes?

163
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,520
That's not how sexuality works.

164
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,840
We're attracted to a person's perceptible features,

165
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
not molecular biology.

166
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
Okay, sure, but I mean,

167
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,360
a lot of trans women still have their penis,

168
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,640
and you gotta admit, that seems kinda gay.

169
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,280
Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you?

170
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,440
We live in a world where there's no shortage of men

171
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,720
who wanna date trans women.

172
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,440
But there's an intense stigma on dating trans women,

173
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,720
and it's actually dangerous,

174
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,520
because what happens is if a man's friends find out

175
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,120
that the woman he's dating is trans,

176
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,000
he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity

177
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,960
by lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating.

178
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,640
And this happens again and again.

179
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,600
And every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay,

180
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,960
you're adding to that stigma,

181
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
and you're making the world a more dangerous

182
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
and violent place for trans women.

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,200
All right, I'm not trying to use violent words or whatever.

184
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,000
I just don't understand how a person who's attracted to women

185
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,320
could be attracted to a person with a penis.

186
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,400
Well, if you wanna know, I'll tell you.

187
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,440
I am a lesbian.

188
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,400
I'm only attracted to women, including trans women.

189
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,240
And when I'm attracted to a trans woman,

190
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
I perceive her as a woman.

191
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,960
And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation,

192
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,360
but as a part of her female body.

193
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,800
So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick.

194
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,160
I'm sorry, what?

195
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,840
What is girl dick?

196
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,040
The feminine penis.

197
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,840
Oh no.

198
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,800
Oh, come on.

199
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,240
This is nonsense.

200
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,840
How could a penis possibly be?

201
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,640
Feminine.

202
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,880
Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman,

203
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,760
but also because hormones actually change the anatomy

204
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,920
and functionality of the penis.

205
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,680
Ugh, shut up, Adria.

206
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,640
Just shut up.

207
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,600
Wait, really?

208
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,560
How is it different?

209
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,920
Well, I'm glad you asked.

210
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,240
More needs to be said about the feminine penis.

211
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
Why is no one talking about the feminine penis?

212
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:13,760
Kill me now.

213
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,600
So to start with, it doesn't get as hard,

214
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,120
it doesn't really ejaculate,

215
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,280
and it has a different mouth feel.

216
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,040
Can we please talk about the mouth feel?

217
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,120
Why is no one talking about the mouth feel?

218
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,760
I don't think that's necessary.

219
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,920
I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.

220
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,480
You are attracted to women with dicks,

221
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,240
but not to men.

222
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,280
That's correct.

223
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,640
I don't like man dick.

224
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,440
It's coarse and rough and irritating,

225
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,120
and it comes everywhere.

226
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,320
Not like girl dick.

227
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Girl dick is everything soft and smooth.

228
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,680
Ugh, what is that?

229
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,480
Star Wars?

230
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,120
Ugh.

231
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,280
Do you also build computers for a living?

232
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,640
I mean, guilty.

233
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,320
I also enjoy wearing knee socks.

234
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,240
And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl.

235
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,360
My sweet love.

236
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
Wait, you're dating that crazy Antifa cat?

237
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,520
Well, we're in the same polycule.

238
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,480
I don't know what that means,

239
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,480
and I'm not, like, prejudiced or anything,

240
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.

241
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,680
Like, if you're born male and you're attracted to women,

242
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,760
how is it not just heterosexuality?

243
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,240
Well, my girlfriend is also trans,

244
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,120
so if you follow your logic to its conclusion...

245
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,800
Okay, so.

246
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,560
You're a woman.

247
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,080
Who's born a man.

248
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
And you like women.

249
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,400
But you're dating a woman.

250
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,640
A woman who has a penis.

251
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,360
You are a female penis that used to be a male penis.

252
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,480
And you're attracted to women.

253
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,760
But you're born a man.

254
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,240
And you're attracted to women.

255
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:44,560
But the woman you're dating has a penis.

256
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,400
So that means you are gay.

257
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,240
But you're gay in the opposite way as the kind of gay that you were born as.

258
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
I can go over it with you again after the show,

259
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,960
if you need some extra time.

260
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals?

261
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,280
Adria, just stop talking.

262
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,120
Look, I don't care what you do in private,

263
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,800
but I'm sorry to break it to you,

264
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,760
the world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.

265
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,280
What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile,

266
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,760
and people like me to be our representatives.

267
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,520
Because I act like a normal woman,

268
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,960
and I date normal men,

269
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,600
and I don't have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick.

270
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,100
Ugh.

271
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,800
Also, I look fucking gorgeous.

272
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,720
I'm sorry, but that matters.

273
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart.

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,520
You're not Blair White.

275
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,920
Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done,

276
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,360
so that's not a fair comparison.

277
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
What work are you having done?

278
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm gonna lower my hairline,

279
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,680
shave some bone off my jaw,

280
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,040
reshape my brow,

281
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,400
get some lip injections,

282
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:40,320
maybe botox my forehead.

283
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
Oh, and I'm gonna fix my nose, obviously.

284
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
What's wrong with your nose?

285
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
It's kind of big and mannish.

286
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,920
Well, my nose looks kind of like that.

287
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,600
Are you saying I look mannish?

288
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,200
Are you saying I look ugly?

289
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,560
What are you trying to say, Tiffany?

290
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
Why are you doing this to me?

291
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,200
Why are you doing this to women?

292
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,840
I'm not doing anything to women.

293
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,480
What?

294
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,960
Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.

295
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,840
That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman.

296
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,000
She has to work really hard to be seen as female,

297
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,880
and you just don't.

298
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,400
Shut the hell up, Adria.

299
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,920
Don't get offended for me.

300
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,440
Don't condescend to me.

301
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,400
I'm not a victim.

302
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,520
Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be,

303
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,200
but my fiancé still thinks I'm beautiful.

304
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
Oh my god.

305
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,840
I need to not be around straight people

306
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,640
for a long time.

307
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm after this.

308
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,560
All right, let's forget about it.

309
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,360
I'm fine.

310
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,600
Tiffany, are you fine?

311
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,640
I am fine.

312
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,880
To be clear, I'm not fine with any of this.

313
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,880
Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out?

314
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,280
Let's shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post.

315
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:45,680
Well, we may never know whether traps are gay,

316
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:48,560
but the important thing is that we talked about it.

317
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,640
I'm Jackie Jackson for The Freedom Report,

318
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,400
where the debate never stops.

319
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,800
Your mascara is running.

320
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,920
Get out of my studio.

321
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,800
Both of you.

322
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,060
Get out.

323
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,400
We're done.

324
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,680
Hi, Nick.

325
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,560
Yeah, I'm finished.

326
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,960
Well, it was a shit show.

327
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,320
No, Adria was fine.

328
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
She was cringe as fuck the whole time.

329
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:18,880
Let's have her back.

330
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,640
Tiffany was the problem.

331
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,560
She kept veering off message.

332
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
And she got emotional.

333
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,280
Yeah, don't invite her back.

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,400
Get Blair next time.

335
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,960
And the week after.

336
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,640
Can we get Kanye West?

337
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,520
We can't get Kanye.

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,680
Get Candace Owens.

339
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,400
Oh, and what have you done to my studio?

340
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,440
Hey, Adria, look.

341
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay?

342
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,960
It's just that I've been working so hard

343
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,720
to win acceptance for trans people,

344
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,920
to show everyone that we're normal,

345
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,520
that we're just like them.

346
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:57,520
And when you show up looking like that

347
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,960
and acting like that,

348
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,560
it's just hard for me to watch

349
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,560
all my hard work be undone, you know?

350
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,400
Like, you can't be talking about

351
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,440
the feminine penis in front of cis people.

352
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,920
Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now

353
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,600
for your own physical safety.

354
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,200
Oh my god, you crazy freak.

355
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,840
Donald Trump is right over here here,

356
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,400
500了我也

357
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,600
I said I can't make you guys cry

358
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:41,760
If you battery out,

359
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,840
you're getting out of here.

360
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:44,960
You're getting old.

361
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,600
I am.

362
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,080
I got Aquí,

363
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,240
and she sticks out

364
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,360
like a bee

365
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,320
You are not, black and white.

366
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,920
I got people who see me because I'm Pinocchio.

367
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:50,960
Don't blame ourselves for that.

368
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,760
We don't do that every day.

369
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:56,400
I hate Adria. She looks like a man-beast.

370
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,800
Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.

371
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
Ah, this hun. People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what

372
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,840
trans people are.

373
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,520
You should not be representing us. They're nothing like me. I'm nothing like them.

374
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:17,040
I need you to relax.

375
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:33,200
No, I want to act a punk toward the acceptance of the truth.

376
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,680
Well, it sucked. You're gonna do that by identifying as a trap.

377
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,120
I look good, but Adria's fucking everything up.

378
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:46,400
All right, what are they saying?

379
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,160
Fuck it.

380
00:15:51,760 --> 00:16:07,040
Okay, so I don't pass perfectly.

381
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,640
But at least I know that. I may have a mental illness, but I'm

382
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,920
I'm self-aware about it. I'm not delusional.

383
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,800
I'm not like Adria. I'm nothing like her.

384
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
You know, it's fine. It's gonna be fine.

385
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,880
I'm gonna have the work done. I can fix this.

386
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,920
It's my fault for not working harder. You can't just expect society to...

387
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,480
I'm not a victim.

388
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,240
I am in control of my life.

389
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
I wish I were a woman.

390
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,360
Or anything but this.

391
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:57,600
I'm destroying my body.

392
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,600
Who could ever love this?

393
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:09,600
I'm just mutilating myself.

394
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,600
It's so disgusting.

395
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,600
God, I'm so disgusting.

396
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,600
It's so disgusting.

397
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,600
It's so disgusting. God, I'm so disgusting.

398
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
It's so disgusting.

399
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,600
I'm just using another drink.

400
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,920
I am not a victim.

401
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,920
I'm in complete control.

402
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,920
I am not a victim.

403
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I am in complete control.

404
00:17:51,600 --> 00:18:21,580
I don't know.

405
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:51,580
I don't know.

406
00:18:51,600 --> 00:19:21,580
I don't know.

407
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:35,120
Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tobles.

408
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,760
Welcome to my world.

409
00:19:51,600 --> 00:20:21,580
Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tobles.

410
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,480
And it's you, dear, head in the sand.

411
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,960
It's not really ignorance of mine.

412
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,740
It's the willful bigot's fight.

413
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:49,500
There is one thing that I cannot stand.

414
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,580
And it's you, dear, head in the sand.

415
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,300
And it's you, dear, head in the sand.

416
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,640
And it's not really ignorance of mine.

417
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,500
It's just the willful bigot's fight.

418
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,740
Don't let them define us.
