1000	6000	My lords, ladies, and those that lieth betwixt,
6000	11000	tis evident, nor sensation nor the passions possess dominion over the mind of man,
11000	17000	which is ruled instead by a reason, sovereign of all faculties.
21000	25000	It must needs be remarked that the power of the Commonwealth
25000	29000	deriveth not from the despotical acquisitions of conquerors,
29000	35000	but from that covenant amongst men, whereby they most resembleth the lobster.
36000	39000	Ah, Farbington, are we doing this again?
39000	44000	Lady Farbington, I'm so happy to finally meet the real you.
44000	45000	Enchant√©.
45000	49000	I'm not gonna kiss your hand, you freak. I'm more of a woman than you are.
49000	51000	It's not what they were saying at the Parisian salon.
51000	53000	Clock me, Amadeus.
53000	56000	Don't break the fourth wall. I'm trying to make a video about postmodernism.
56000	59000	Get out of my drawing room, eighteenth-century scum.
59000	60000	Sexual deviance.
60000	62000	So much for the tolerant Jacobins.
68000	71000	Reason. Power. Truth.
71000	74000	These are the kinds of topics that I simply don't care about.
74000	78000	Unfortunately, we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson.
78000	80000	So who's Jordan Peterson?
84000	87000	Well, he's a psychology professor at the University of Toronto,
87000	93000	who got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law
93000	95000	shall surely lead to Stalinism.
95000	98000	Since then, he's been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer.
98000	102000	David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the Western world,
102000	107000	and his self-help book, Twelve Rules for Life, is a national and international bestseller.
107000	110000	I'm starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously.
110000	115000	He's got a lot of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here, because I want to talk.
115000	116000	A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson,
116000	119000	haven't really engaged with his ideas very much.
119000	122000	He's often caricatured, avoided, or talked past,
122000	124000	as in the infamous BBC interview,
124000	129000	where Cathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says.
129000	134000	So you're saying that by and large, women are too agreeable to get the pay rises they deserve?
134000	136000	No, I'm saying that that's one component.
136000	139000	You're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies?
139000	140000	No.
140000	142000	You're just saying these things though to provoke, aren't you?
142000	143000	I mean, you are a provocateur.
143000	144000	I never say anything.
144000	146000	You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to.
146000	151000	You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters.
151000	156000	I think to people watching this, it comes off as if leftists are like, afraid of his actual ideas.
156000	158000	But I'm not afraid of his ideas.
158000	159000	I'm not afraid of anything.
159000	161000	I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP.
167000	168000	Daddy.
168000	174000	So I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson's lectures and podcasts and reading his books,
174000	177000	and honestly, I think I get why people like him.
177000	181000	Clearly, he has real talent as a public speaker and as a kind of life coach.
181000	188000	His book, Twelve Rules for Life, echoes past bestsellers like Stephen Covey's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
188000	190000	or Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life.
190000	196000	The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like take responsibility for yourself,
196000	202000	don't envy other people, and he renews them with the intellectual trappings of psychology, philosophy,
202000	204000	Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.
204000	206000	He's telling us a pretty classic story.
206000	210000	Life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering,
210000	212000	so you need a higher purpose in your life.
212000	213000	But I knew that already.
213000	216000	I learned it at the AA meetings I refused to go to.
216000	219000	These are like basic insights of world philosophy and religion.
219000	223000	But they're insights that today's youths apparently haven't heard before.
223000	226000	I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics.
226000	229000	Or at any rate, they haven't heard them in a vocabulary they connected with.
229000	231000	So to a lot of people, Peterson's ideas hurt.
232000	233000	They seem new and urgent.
233000	236000	And I don't really object to any of the self-help stuff.
236000	238000	Most of Peterson's fans are young men.
238000	241000	And, I mean, someone has to whip the neckbeards into shape.
241000	244000	And if Peterson can do that, more power to him.
244000	247000	I mean, sometimes boys just need a daddy.
247000	249000	And sometimes girls do too.
250000	252000	But there's a big problem here.
252000	258000	And the problem is that all of this life coaching is basically just a Trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda.
258000	260000	Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help,
260000	262000	not merely as a guide to private life,
262000	265000	but as a replacement for progressive politics,
265000	268000	which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.
268000	272000	There's no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?
272000	274000	Why not?
274000	278000	The philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy.
278000	281000	Now, Peterson doesn't use the word progressive politics,
281000	283000	because that doesn't sound scary enough.
283000	288000	His new, scarier word is postmodern neo-Marxism.
288000	291000	Now, we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neo-Marxism
292000	294000	with cultural Marxism,
294000	298000	the Nazi conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West.
298000	301000	Surely, this is not the same thing as that, right?
301000	302000	Right?
302000	306000	So look, I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist.
306000	307000	And you may quote me on that.
307000	313000	But I am wondering, if it's not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West,
313000	316000	then what is postmodern neo-Marxism?
316000	319000	Well, JP, that's what I'd like to talk about.
319000	321000	So Jordan, sorry, Dr. Peterson,
321000	322000	Professor,
322000	323000	Daddy,
323000	324000	let's talk.
324000	330000	And for once, I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect I think it deserves.
340000	341000	That's good.
341000	342000	It's a good temperature.
342000	344000	Hand me the oil, would you, Daddy?
346000	347000	Thanks, Daddy.
348000	350000	It's really an honour to bathe with a public intellectual.
351000	353000	The intellectual of your stature.
355000	357000	You know, I never like to argue in the bath,
357000	360000	so I want to start by telling you the things I like about you.
360000	363000	The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the Left,
363000	366000	the stifling of even slightly different opinions,
366000	369000	the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments,
369000	371000	the politics of resentment,
371000	376000	are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.
376000	380000	I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person.
380000	382000	So if you're into dysphoria, please don't watch it.
382000	385000	But my worry is that you're leading an international political backlash
385000	388000	against what is a very localized problem.
388000	393000	And I worry that some of our society's most vulnerable people could be hurt by that backlash.
393000	397000	Like, fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly sensitive student activists,
397000	403000	but if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights,
403000	405000	that would be bad, right?
405000	410000	I also like that you tell people how to live their lives.
410000	413000	I mean, I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom,
413000	417000	but, clearly, the sheep need a shepherd.
417000	419000	And you've really stepped up with these 12 rules.
419000	421000	You know, in the Left, we don't really tell people what to do.
421000	423000	We tell them what not to do.
423000	424000	Don't exploit the workers.
424000	426000	Do not do blackface.
426000	428000	I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people,
428000	431000	but that's a pretty small rule compared to some of your rules,
431000	433000	like how to raise your children,
433000	435000	or when it's okay to do that.
435000	437000	Is it okay to criticize things?
438000	441000	The last thing I like is you talk about deep shit.
441000	444000	I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons
444000	447000	were talking about Plato and Aristotle and the meaning of life,
447000	449000	and I thought, huh.
449000	452000	On the Left, we don't really talk about that kind of thing.
452000	455000	All we talk about is how society oppresses people.
455000	457000	And that might not be enough,
457000	459000	because people need to have a positive purpose in life.
459000	462000	I mean, personally, I don't give a shit.
462000	464000	I'm pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons
464000	466000	of Strangers with Candy until I die.
466000	469000	But other people, like Dostoevsky, Camus,
469000	472000	other white guys who talk about lobsters,
472000	476000	they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering
476000	479000	and, like, not just complain about patriarchy.
479000	481000	I guess it's easier to not complain about patriarchy
481000	483000	when patriarchy isn't the thing that's making you suffer.
483000	486000	But I do think that an education that only teaches people
486000	488000	about oppression is inadequate.
488000	491000	We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad,
491000	493000	and then we say, well, you're educated now,
493000	497000	good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye!
497000	499000	And that really kinda sucks.
499000	503000	But you know, I think that's a point that could probably be made
503000	506000	without comparing transgender activism to Stalin.
508000	511000	I feel like this came across a little more sarcastic than I intended.
511000	514000	See, this is why you've got to use a firmer hand with me, Peterson.
514000	517000	If you don't establish dominance, I'm just gonna mouth off.
517000	520000	They use all this compassion language,
520000	522000	and I'm on the side of the oppressed.
522000	524000	They use all of that posturing.
524000	527000	It does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power.
527000	530000	And I've just been starting to review their curriculum
530000	532000	for children from kindergarten to grade eight.
532000	535000	It's pure social justice postmodernism.
535000	538000	The people who hold this doctrine,
538000	541000	this radical postmodern communitarian doctrine
541000	545000	that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity
545000	547000	or some kind of group identity paramount,
547000	551000	they've got control over the most low-committing,
551000	554000	low-to-mid-level bureaucratic structures.
554000	556000	And many governments as well.
556000	558000	But even in the United States, where, you know, a lot of...
581000	582000	I don't know.
589000	591000	So you've got to give it to J.P.
591000	592000	When he says,
592000	594000	stand up straight with your shoulders back,
594000	595000	he means it.
595000	598000	So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences
598000	600000	with fairly popular opinions.
600000	602000	Political correctness often feels stifling.
602000	606000	Student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive.
606000	608000	Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use,
608000	609000	and I don't like it.
609000	610000	But once he draws you in
610000	612000	with these inviting preludes,
612000	614000	he leads you to a pretty weird place.
614000	616000	His central political message is that
616000	618000	leftist professors, student activists,
618000	620000	campus diversity initiatives,
620000	622000	and corporate HR departments
622000	624000	are collectively following the philosophy
624000	626000	of postmodern neo-Marxism
626000	628000	to destroy Western civilization
628000	631000	and sink us all into a totalitarian nightmare.
631000	633000	Now there's just no avoiding that this idea
633000	636000	is actually pretty similar to the cultural Marxism
636000	638000	or cultural Bolshevism theory.
638000	640000	But I'm just going to repeat it.
640000	641000	So ignore that,
641000	642000	because if I dwell on it,
642000	645000	I'll sound like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist,
645000	647000	and then everyone will think I'm crazy.
647000	650000	Look, I'm not afraid of psychologists.
650000	651000	I don't have anything to hide.
651000	653000	So let's just try not to think about that,
653000	656000	and instead straightforwardly ask,
656000	658000	is it true that postmodern neo-Marxism
658000	660000	is out to destroy us all?
660000	663000	Well, why don't we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism?
663000	665000	We all know what Marxism is,
665000	667000	the idea that society should be understood
667000	669000	as a class struggle between workers and capitalists,
669000	671000	and that the workers will eventually revolt.
671000	673000	Some college professors definitely do believe that,
673000	676000	but 0% of corporate HR departments do,
676000	678000	so that...
678000	679000	Okay.
679000	681000	So what is postmodernism?
681000	684000	Well, it's the vaguest word in the English language.
684000	685000	Some people try to explain it
685000	687000	by listing all the things that are called postmodern,
687000	690000	and then trying to guess what they have in common.
690000	692000	That's basically what the YouTuber Armored Skeptic
692000	693000	did in his video about it.
693000	695000	So many daddies in this video.
695000	697000	We should invite them all to a barbecue,
697000	698000	complain about postmodernism,
698000	700000	listen to some Zeppelin.
700000	701000	I've had worse evenings.
701000	703000	I don't think there really is a common thread
703000	705000	linking all the things called postmodern.
705000	708000	Basically, postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945
708000	709000	that seemed new at the time.
709000	711000	But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism,
711000	714000	he's not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino.
714000	717000	He's talking about postmodern philosophy.
717000	718000	So what's that?
718000	719000	Well...
719000	721000	Basically, it's a kind of skepticism.
721000	723000	Not YouTube skepticism,
723000	724000	but actual skepticism.
724000	726000	You know, like having doubts
726000	728000	about whether humans can really know things.
728000	731000	Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea.
731000	733000	That goes way back to ancient times.
733000	735000	But more specifically,
735000	738000	postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.
738000	739000	So what's modernism?
739000	740000	What's what?
740000	741000	What are words?
741000	742000	What's anything?
742000	744000	I'm going to divide modernism into two periods
744000	745000	because I feel like it.
745000	747000	First, there's early modernism.
747000	749000	Early modernism is the philosophy developed
749000	751000	by a bunch of boring 18th century queens
751000	753000	which says that we can form universal theories
753000	756000	about the world through observation and reasoning,
756000	757000	aka the scientific method.
757000	759000	Now that turns out to work pretty well
759000	762000	for whatever questions you have about plants and crystals
762000	765000	and how to medically reconfigure human genitals,
765000	767000	but it has some limits,
767000	769000	which was pointed out by David Hume,
769000	771000	one of the least boring 18th century queens
771000	773000	and one of the only philosophers
773000	775000	I can actually put up with in small doses
775000	777000	even though he was a fucking racist
777000	778000	and also Scottish.
778000	779000	This is a callout.
779000	782000	Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective,
782000	785000	you can't really know much about important things
785000	786000	like morality, causation,
786000	788000	and the self
788000	791000	because those aren't the kinds of things you can observe.
791000	793000	Anyway, then the late modernists came along
793000	794000	and they said,
794000	795000	fuck Hume,
795000	797000	we're going to do science about those things anyway.
797000	800000	So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards
800000	801000	who, one way or another,
801000	805000	tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans.
805000	807000	So for example, you have psychoanalysis,
807000	809000	which said human nature can be understood
809000	811000	in terms of unconscious drives,
811000	813000	which is of course ridiculous.
813000	815000	I'm conscious of all my drives.
815000	816000	And you got Marxism,
816000	818000	with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat.
818000	821000	You got early sociology and anthropology,
821000	823000	which started out with racist social evolutionism
823000	825000	and progressed to a kind of
825000	827000	we're all the same universalism.
827000	829000	Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists.
829000	831000	His first book, Maps of Meaning,
831000	834000	is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world
834000	836000	and create order out of chaos
836000	838000	through universal myths and archetypes,
838000	842000	which he claims are a product of our species' evolutionary past.
842000	844000	Boy, this is a lot of explaining.
844000	845000	It's so much explaining,
845000	847000	it's triggering gender dysphoria.
847000	849000	I better put on some longer nails.
849000	850000	Nails?
850000	852000	Is that all womanhood means to you?
855000	858000	Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.
858000	861000	So whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories
861000	863000	about reality, history, and humanity,
863000	865000	postmodernists say,
865000	867000	actually, no, that's not possible.
867000	869000	For example, the French postmodernist
869000	871000	Michel Foucault
871000	872000	Sargon?
872000	874000	You little goose.
874000	875000	Michel Foucault
875000	877000	wrote intellectual histories of subjects
877000	880000	like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice,
880000	882000	in which he argued that we should not understand these histories
882000	886000	as straightforward progressions toward liberty and scientific truth,
886000	889000	but rather as mere shifts in the way that power
889000	892000	orders our institutions and populations.
892000	895000	The other postmodernist I've actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty.
895000	896000	Yeah, fuck you, Derrida.
896000	898000	If you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read.
898000	901000	Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls ironism,
901000	903000	irony being the skeptical caution
903000	906000	with which we should regard our own beliefs and our awareness
906000	909000	that our vocabulary for describing and understanding the world
909000	912000	is not the final or best vocabulary.
912000	914000	Alright, that's enough explaining.
914000	916000	And my nails are done. Check it out.
916000	918000	Do you enjoy having long, glamorous nails
918000	921000	but do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them
921000	923000	with barely concealed visceral rage?
923000	925000	Well, I have a solution for you.
925000	927000	The bisexual manicure.
927000	929000	One hand for the V, one hand for the D.
929000	931000	Both for degeneracy.
931000	932000	It's absolutely filthy.
932000	935000	So we've got all the pieces on the table.
935000	937000	Now we've just got to put the puzzle together.
937000	939000	On the one hand, we have Marxism,
939000	941000	a fundamentally modernist worldview
941000	944000	that theorizes the human condition in economic terms.
944000	946000	On the other hand, we have postmodernism,
946000	949000	a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity
949000	951000	to know any universal truths about anything.
951000	955000	On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas are not compatible.
955000	957000	And there is an extensive history of dispute between them,
957000	960000	with, for instance, the Marxist Sartre
960000	961000	calling Foucault
961000	964000	the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.
964000	967000	And of course, as we all know, when Foucault died,
967000	969000	capitalism did end forever.
973000	976000	So where does Peterson get off talking about postmodern neo-Marxism?
976000	978000	Well, it's true that a lot of postmodernists
978000	980000	were in some way influenced by Marxism,
980000	983000	so the phrase could just refer to that continuity.
983000	985000	But that's not what Peterson means.
985000	987000	It's clear from the way he uses the term
987000	989000	that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical
989000	990000	than it initially appears.
990000	993000	Peterson uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism
993000	995000	to include not only postmodern intellectuals
995000	997000	and Marxist intellectuals,
997000	1000000	but also liberal politicians, academic administrators,
1000000	1003000	and corporate HR departments that care about diversity,
1003000	1006000	and so-called identity politics activists,
1006000	1009000	including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists.
1009000	1011000	Basically, it's the entirety of the modern left.
1011000	1014000	Now, I've already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism
1014000	1016000	are fundamentally at odds,
1016000	1018000	since Marxism is a big story about a struggle
1018000	1020000	between two clear and distinct groups,
1020000	1024000	and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this,
1024000	1026000	and about the stability of binaries
1026000	1028000	like bourgeoisie and proletariat.
1028000	1030000	But that's not the only tension in Peterson's
1030000	1033000	clusterfuck idea of postmodern neo-Marxism.
1033000	1036000	Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows
1036000	1038000	that Marxists and identity politics activists
1038000	1040000	are constantly at each other's throats,
1040000	1042000	because the Marxists accuse the activists
1042000	1046000	of being bourgeois dogs who want more female CEOs of color
1046000	1048000	and more disabled transgender drone pilots,
1048000	1050000	while the activists accuse the Marxists
1050000	1052000	of being a boys' club of brocialists
1052000	1054000	no more woke on gender and race issues
1054000	1056000	than the average Jordan Peterson fan.
1056000	1058000	Most often, these accusations are correct,
1058000	1060000	because everyone is problematic,
1060000	1062000	and I disown them all.
1062000	1064000	And then there's also the conflict
1064000	1066000	between the identity politics activists
1066000	1067000	and the postmodernists.
1067000	1070000	Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern?
1070000	1072000	There's nothing postmodern about it.
1072000	1075000	Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice,
1075000	1078000	for particular groups, such as women, people of color,
1078000	1080000	and gay and trans people.
1080000	1082000	This kind of activism presupposes
1082000	1084000	that these group categories exist
1084000	1087000	and are a useful basis for political organizing.
1087000	1089000	Postmodernists do kind of the opposite.
1089000	1091000	They want to show that these categories
1091000	1093000	race, gender, sexual orientation,
1093000	1095000	are contingent social constructs
1095000	1098000	and are themselves potentially oppressive.
1098000	1100000	This is why conventional feminist activists
1100000	1102000	often hate postmodern feminism.
1102000	1104000	Because the postmodern feminists want to show
1104000	1107000	that the whole concept of womanhood, for instance,
1107000	1109000	is contingent and potentially oppressive,
1109000	1111000	and they think we should be working to destabilize
1111000	1112000	and undermine it.
1112000	1114000	And then the conventional feminist activists say,
1114000	1115000	the fuck?
1115000	1117000	We need the concept of womanhood
1117000	1119000	to organize around women's political interests.
1119000	1121000	How are we supposed to do that
1121000	1124000	if we undermine and destabilize the concept of womanhood?
1124000	1126000	And in turn, the postmodern feminists say,
1126000	1128000	well, here's a quotation from Judith Butler,
1128000	1131000	the most famous postmodern feminist ever.
1131000	1133000	Is it not a sign of despair over public politics
1133000	1135000	when identity becomes its own policy,
1135000	1137000	bringing with it those who would police it
1137000	1139000	from various sides?
1139000	1141000	And this is not a call to return to silence
1141000	1142000	or invisibility,
1142000	1144000	but rather to make use of a category
1144000	1146000	that can be called into question,
1146000	1149000	made to account for what it excludes.
1149000	1151000	If you take the first part of that quote out of context,
1151000	1152000	it almost sounds like something
1152000	1154000	Jordan Peterson could have said.
1154000	1156000	The difference is that J.P. actually does think
1156000	1159000	we should return to silence and invisibility.
1159000	1160000	Or does he?
1160000	1162000	It's hard to tell what he thinks.
1162000	1163000	More on that in a moment.
1163000	1165000	I bring all of this up to show that
1165000	1168000	1 the idea of postmodern neo-Marxist identity politics
1168000	1171000	as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical
1171000	1175000	and 2 identity politics is not this dogma
1175000	1177000	that must go unquestioned.
1177000	1179000	There are sophisticated debates about this
1179000	1181000	going on within leftist academia,
1181000	1183000	but Jordan Peterson either doesn't know that
1183000	1184000	or doesn't care.
1184000	1187000	He uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism
1187000	1190000	to characterize the left as a unified philosophical force
1190000	1192000	bent on destroying Western civilization
1192000	1194000	when in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons
1194000	1196000	who can't stop squabbling with each other
1196000	1198000	over every goddamn little issue.
1198000	1200000	The only reason I can think of
1200000	1203000	that the left would appear to be a unified philosophical force
1203000	1205000	is if you're so far to the right
1205000	1207000	that literally everyone who supports
1207000	1210000	the economic and social advancement of disadvantaged groups
1210000	1212000	looks like one homogenous enemy.
1212000	1214000	But is that what Jordan Peterson is saying?
1214000	1216000	That he opposes all social progress
1216000	1218000	for women, racial, and sexual minorities?
1218000	1220000	Well, it's difficult to say
1220000	1222000	because while he spends much of his time
1222000	1224000	comparing activists for these movements
1224000	1226000	to 20th century mass murderers,
1226000	1228000	he resists being pinned down
1228000	1230000	to any more specific position.
1230000	1232000	I was maybe too harsh on Cathy Newman earlier.
1232000	1234000	She came out of that interview looking bad,
1234000	1236000	but she had a tough job to do.
1236000	1238000	Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves
1238000	1240000	saying something that's more or less
1240000	1242000	uncontroversially true,
1242000	1244000	while at the same time implying something controversial.
1244000	1247000	For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like
1247000	1250000	there are biological differences between men and women,
1250000	1251000	which is obviously true.
1251000	1253000	But he'll say it in the context of a conversation
1253000	1256000	about the underrepresentation of women in government,
1256000	1258000	which implies...
1258000	1259000	what exactly?
1259000	1261000	So how do you respond to this?
1261000	1263000	Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing
1263000	1265000	against the obviously true statement,
1265000	1267000	or you have to guess at what he's implying,
1267000	1269000	in response to which he can accuse you
1269000	1271000	of misrepresenting him,
1271000	1274000	which is exactly what happened with the Cathy Newman interview.
1274000	1276000	The most famous moment where Peterson does this
1276000	1278000	is the notorious lobster argument.
1278000	1279000	So he starts by saying,
1279000	1280000	There's this idea.
1280000	1283000	There's this idea that hierarchical structures
1283000	1287000	are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy.
1287000	1290000	And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies,
1290000	1294000	and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years,
1294000	1297000	so checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists.
1297000	1300000	You're saying that we should organize our societies
1300000	1302000	along the lines of the lobsters.
1302000	1305000	I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity
1305000	1308000	in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures.
1308000	1310000	The problem with that is that,
1310000	1313000	no one has ever said that every hierarchy
1313000	1315000	is the product of Western patriarchy.
1315000	1317000	This is such a massive straw man
1317000	1320000	that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation
1320000	1323000	of Peterson suggested by Cathy Newman in this interview.
1323000	1327000	No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.
1327000	1330000	Even the anarchists, whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies,
1330000	1334000	limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies.
1334000	1337000	No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies.
1337000	1339000	The hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender,
1339000	1342000	race, and economics within our own society,
1342000	1345000	to which the lobster case is a complete non sequitur.
1345000	1347000	I mean, you could use Peterson's lobster argument
1347000	1349000	the same way he uses it
1349000	1352000	to justify literally any hierarchy or authority,
1352000	1354000	no matter how unjust.
1354000	1356000	You could be an 18th century Republican
1356000	1358000	arguing against the monarchy,
1358000	1360000	and the monarch could turn around and say,
1360000	1362000	well, hierarchies are inevitable.
1362000	1364000	God save the lobster queen.
1366000	1367000	Oh dear God.
1367000	1368000	My lords.
1368000	1369000	Ladies.
1369000	1371000	And those at life betwixt.
1371000	1374000	Present rumors and Republican rumblings
1374000	1375000	amongst the rabble
1375000	1378000	have compelled us to summon you together.
1378000	1381000	Let us remind you that nature
1381000	1383000	hath so made the lobster
1383000	1387000	that some individuals be stronger than the others.
1387000	1392000	Therefore, let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty
1392000	1395000	be anywise impugned.
1395000	1397000	And as for parliamentarians,
1397000	1402000	well, let them vote for cake.
1404000	1406000	Very good. Thank you.
1409000	1411000	I need new roommates.
1411000	1413000	So I've argued that Peterson is evoking
1413000	1416000	the incoherent concept of postmodern neo-Marxism
1416000	1419000	as the supervillain in a childishly simple worldview
1419000	1421000	he's promoting where these evil leftists
1421000	1423000	are out to destroy the West.
1423000	1426000	Now, it's time to inspect the other side of this coin.
1426000	1428000	What, exactly, is the West?
1428000	1431000	Well, there's an academic usage of the term the West
1431000	1433000	that describes the intellectual tradition
1433000	1437000	that runs from ancient Athens to modern-day Europe and its colonies.
1437000	1439000	Now, a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct
1439000	1441000	the whole concept of the West
1441000	1444000	and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary
1444000	1447000	and supremacist and justifies imperialism
1447000	1448000	and all that kind of thing.
1448000	1450000	But we don't have time for that right now.
1450000	1452000	So I'm just gonna grant that the West is a thing
1452000	1454000	and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it.
1454000	1455000	For Peterson,
1455000	1459000	the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism, individualism,
1459000	1462000	the idea that each human has a spark of divinity,
1462000	1465000	and he therefore equates it with Judeo-Christian values,
1465000	1468000	a term more popular with conservative pundits
1468000	1470000	than intellectual historians.
1470000	1472000	Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values
1472000	1474000	with postmodern neo-Marxism,
1474000	1476000	which he describes as anti-Western,
1476000	1479000	collectivist, relativist, and totalitarian.
1479000	1481000	This framing of a conflict of ideas
1481000	1484000	in terms of geographical chauvinism and external threat
1484000	1487000	is inaccurate and scaremongering.
1487000	1489000	Marxism is Western philosophy.
1489000	1491000	Postmodernism is Western philosophy.
1491000	1493000	If you're really concerned about preserving
1493000	1496000	the geographical boundaries of the intellectual tradition,
1496000	1499000	you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.
1499000	1502000	Likewise, there is no feature of SJW ideology
1502000	1504000	that is meaningfully non-Western.
1504000	1507000	The very idea of people requesting different pronouns
1507000	1509000	to suit their individual needs
1509000	1511000	is exactly the kind of thing
1511000	1513000	a person who values individual liberty
1513000	1515000	over collective dogma should be on board with.
1515000	1517000	You could even argue that Marxism
1517000	1519000	is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy,
1519000	1521000	with its concern for human progress,
1521000	1523000	science, and liberty.
1523000	1525000	I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Peterson
1525000	1527000	talk about the Western tradition,
1527000	1530000	but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.
1530000	1531000	If you did read it,
1531000	1534000	you'd find a surprising diversity of thought
1534000	1537000	that doesn't reduce to Judeo-Christian values.
1537000	1539000	Much of Plato's political dialogues
1539000	1542000	are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,
1542000	1543000	suggesting that,
1543000	1546000	far from being an invention of postmodernity,
1546000	1548000	it was actually a pretty popular worldview
1548000	1550000	among ancient Athenian pederasts.
1550000	1553000	Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher David Hume
1553000	1555000	famously said that reason is,
1555000	1557000	and ought only to be,
1557000	1559000	the slave of the passions,
1559000	1561000	literally, feels over reals.
1561000	1564000	And meanwhile, his contemporary, the Marquis de Sade,
1564000	1566000	was advocating the abolition of morality,
1566000	1568000	filling the churches with scat porn,
1568000	1571000	and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion
1571000	1573000	so decadent and depraved,
1573000	1576000	I'm not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube.
1576000	1579000	This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,
1579000	1581000	and it's just as much a part of the West
1581000	1584000	as Peterson's soggy, Bible-padding conservatism.
1584000	1588000	But again, and I really can't stress this enough,
1588000	1590000	I don't care either way.
1590000	1594000	I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design.
1594000	1596000	So what do you people want from me?
1596000	1599000	The lobster queen is dead. Long live the queen.
1601000	1606000	TO BE CONTINUED
1631000	1660220	I think you would agree
1660220	1661720	that there's just a foundational erosion
1661720	1664180	that I think people of all sides,
1664220	1666260	and I think there's totally intellectually smart people
1666260	1667580	on the far left that can help.
1669220	1670060	Where are those people?
1670220	1675200	There's a YouTuber that I'm actually quite interested in
1675200	1678040	that I watch her, and I don't mean to misgender her
1678040	1680600	because I think she identifies with her, ContraPoints.
1680600	1681980	I don't know if you've heard of this YouTuber
1681980	1683140	who's on the far left.
1683160	1684680	I've seen the name come up every now and again on Twitter.
1685040	1687180	Totally disagree with everything this person says,
1687380	1688400	but I look at it and I'm like,
1688460	1689920	this seems very reasonable, educated,
1690040	1690200	academic, and I'm like,
1690220	1694260	and I'm seeing reasons to hope
1694260	1695420	that everyone's going to come together.
1696360	1697760	Hello, Dave.
