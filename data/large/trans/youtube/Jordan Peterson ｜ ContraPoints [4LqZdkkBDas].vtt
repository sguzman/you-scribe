00:01.000 --> 00:06.000
My lords, ladies, and those that lieth betwixt,

00:06.000 --> 00:11.000
tis evident, nor sensation nor the passions possess dominion over the mind of man,

00:11.000 --> 00:17.000
which is ruled instead by a reason, sovereign of all faculties.

00:21.000 --> 00:25.000
It must needs be remarked that the power of the Commonwealth

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
deriveth not from the despotical acquisitions of conquerors,

00:29.000 --> 00:35.000
but from that covenant amongst men, whereby they most resembleth the lobster.

00:36.000 --> 00:39.000
Ah, Farbington, are we doing this again?

00:39.000 --> 00:44.000
Lady Farbington, I'm so happy to finally meet the real you.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.000
EnchantÃ©.

00:45.000 --> 00:49.000
I'm not gonna kiss your hand, you freak. I'm more of a woman than you are.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
It's not what they were saying at the Parisian salon.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
Clock me, Amadeus.

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Don't break the fourth wall. I'm trying to make a video about postmodernism.

00:56.000 --> 00:59.000
Get out of my drawing room, eighteenth-century scum.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Sexual deviance.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
So much for the tolerant Jacobins.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Reason. Power. Truth.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.000
These are the kinds of topics that I simply don't care about.

01:14.000 --> 01:18.000
Unfortunately, we have to talk about them because of a guy named Jordan Peterson.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
So who's Jordan Peterson?

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
Well, he's a psychology professor at the University of Toronto,

01:27.000 --> 01:33.000
who got famous for sounding the alarm about how protecting transgender people under Canadian human rights law

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
shall surely lead to Stalinism.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
Since then, he's been touring North America as a celebrity lecturer.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.000
David Brooks called him the most influential public intellectual in the Western world,

01:42.000 --> 01:47.000
and his self-help book, Twelve Rules for Life, is a national and international bestseller.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
I'm starting to think we may need to take this guy seriously.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
He's got a lot of fans on YouTube, and I hope you guys are here, because I want to talk.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
A lot of leftists who have responded to Peterson,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
haven't really engaged with his ideas very much.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.000
He's often caricatured, avoided, or talked past,

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
as in the infamous BBC interview,

02:04.000 --> 02:09.000
where Cathy Newman keeps repeating back very uncharitable interpretations of everything he says.

02:09.000 --> 02:14.000
So you're saying that by and large, women are too agreeable to get the pay rises they deserve?

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
No, I'm saying that that's one component.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
You're saying that women aren't intelligent enough to run these top companies?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
No.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
You're just saying these things though to provoke, aren't you?

02:22.000 --> 02:23.000
I mean, you are a provocateur.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
I never say anything.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
You're like the alt-right that you hate to be compared to.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
You're saying that we should organize our societies along the lines of the lobsters.

02:31.000 --> 02:36.000
I think to people watching this, it comes off as if leftists are like, afraid of his actual ideas.

02:36.000 --> 02:38.000
But I'm not afraid of his ideas.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
I'm not afraid of anything.

02:39.000 --> 02:41.000
I just smoked a bunch of fucking PCP.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.000
Daddy.

02:48.000 --> 02:54.000
So I spent the last couple weeks listening to hours of Peterson's lectures and podcasts and reading his books,

02:54.000 --> 02:57.000
and honestly, I think I get why people like him.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
Clearly, he has real talent as a public speaker and as a kind of life coach.

03:01.000 --> 03:08.000
His book, Twelve Rules for Life, echoes past bestsellers like Stephen Covey's The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
or Rick Warren's The Purpose Driven Life.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.000
The difference is that Peterson takes basic self-help insights like take responsibility for yourself,

03:16.000 --> 03:22.000
don't envy other people, and he renews them with the intellectual trappings of psychology, philosophy,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
Jungian psychoanalysis, and Bible readings.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
He's telling us a pretty classic story.

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
Life is suffering, happiness is not enough to sustain you through suffering,

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
so you need a higher purpose in your life.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
But I knew that already.

03:33.000 --> 03:36.000
I learned it at the AA meetings I refused to go to.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.000
These are like basic insights of world philosophy and religion.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.000
But they're insights that today's youths apparently haven't heard before.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
I guess because not enough of them are alcoholics.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
Or at any rate, they haven't heard them in a vocabulary they connected with.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.000
So to a lot of people, Peterson's ideas hurt.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
They seem new and urgent.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
And I don't really object to any of the self-help stuff.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Most of Peterson's fans are young men.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.000
And, I mean, someone has to whip the neckbeards into shape.

04:01.000 --> 04:04.000
And if Peterson can do that, more power to him.

04:04.000 --> 04:07.000
I mean, sometimes boys just need a daddy.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
And sometimes girls do too.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
But there's a big problem here.

04:12.000 --> 04:18.000
And the problem is that all of this life coaching is basically just a Trojan horse for a reactionary political agenda.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Peterson advocates an ethics of self-help,

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
not merely as a guide to private life,

04:22.000 --> 04:25.000
but as a replacement for progressive politics,

04:25.000 --> 04:28.000
which he characterizes as totalitarian and evil.

04:28.000 --> 04:32.000
There's no comparison between Mao and a trans activist, is there?

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
Why not?

04:34.000 --> 04:38.000
The philosophy that's guiding their utterances is the same philosophy.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Now, Peterson doesn't use the word progressive politics,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
because that doesn't sound scary enough.

04:43.000 --> 04:48.000
His new, scarier word is postmodern neo-Marxism.

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Now, we have to be careful not to confuse postmodern neo-Marxism

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
with cultural Marxism,

04:54.000 --> 04:58.000
the Nazi conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
Surely, this is not the same thing as that, right?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Right?

05:02.000 --> 05:06.000
So look, I genuinely do not think Jordan Peterson is a fascist.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.000
And you may quote me on that.

05:07.000 --> 05:13.000
But I am wondering, if it's not a fascist conspiracy theory about Marxist intellectuals plotting to destroy the West,

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
then what is postmodern neo-Marxism?

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
Well, JP, that's what I'd like to talk about.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
So Jordan, sorry, Dr. Peterson,

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
Professor,

05:22.000 --> 05:23.000
Daddy,

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
let's talk.

05:24.000 --> 05:30.000
And for once, I'd like to actually treat this discussion with the seriousness and respect I think it deserves.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.000
That's good.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
It's a good temperature.

05:42.000 --> 05:44.000
Hand me the oil, would you, Daddy?

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Thanks, Daddy.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
It's really an honour to bathe with a public intellectual.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
The intellectual of your stature.

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
You know, I never like to argue in the bath,

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
so I want to start by telling you the things I like about you.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.000
The first thing is that I think some of your criticisms of the Left,

06:03.000 --> 06:06.000
the stifling of even slightly different opinions,

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
the gratuitous loathing of Western cultural monuments,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
the politics of resentment,

06:11.000 --> 06:16.000
are, within a certain mediocre corner of academia, valid complaints.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.000
I even made a video about that a long time ago when I was a different person.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
So if you're into dysphoria, please don't watch it.

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
But my worry is that you're leading an international political backlash

06:25.000 --> 06:28.000
against what is a very localized problem.

06:28.000 --> 06:33.000
And I worry that some of our society's most vulnerable people could be hurt by that backlash.

06:33.000 --> 06:37.000
Like, fine, you hate postmodern intellectuals and overly sensitive student activists,

06:37.000 --> 06:43.000
but if your backlash also targets gender equality, LGBT acceptance, and civil rights,

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
that would be bad, right?

06:45.000 --> 06:50.000
I also like that you tell people how to live their lives.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.000
I mean, I personally hate taking orders outside of the bedroom,

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
but, clearly, the sheep need a shepherd.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
And you've really stepped up with these 12 rules.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You know, in the Left, we don't really tell people what to do.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
We tell them what not to do.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Don't exploit the workers.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
Do not do blackface.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I guess we tell people what pronouns to use for trans people,

07:08.000 --> 07:11.000
but that's a pretty small rule compared to some of your rules,

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
like how to raise your children,

07:13.000 --> 07:15.000
or when it's okay to do that.

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
Is it okay to criticize things?

07:18.000 --> 07:21.000
The last thing I like is you talk about deep shit.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
I was watching a video where you and a couple of zany goons

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
were talking about Plato and Aristotle and the meaning of life,

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
and I thought, huh.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.000
On the Left, we don't really talk about that kind of thing.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.000
All we talk about is how society oppresses people.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
And that might not be enough,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.000
because people need to have a positive purpose in life.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
I mean, personally, I don't give a shit.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.000
I'm pretty happy to sit here watching the same three seasons

07:44.000 --> 07:46.000
of Strangers with Candy until I die.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.000
But other people, like Dostoevsky, Camus,

07:49.000 --> 07:52.000
other white guys who talk about lobsters,

07:52.000 --> 07:56.000
they have this need to have purpose in the face of suffering

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
and, like, not just complain about patriarchy.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
I guess it's easier to not complain about patriarchy

08:01.000 --> 08:03.000
when patriarchy isn't the thing that's making you suffer.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.000
But I do think that an education that only teaches people

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
about oppression is inadequate.

08:08.000 --> 08:11.000
We spend four years teaching undergraduates why capitalism is bad,

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
and then we say, well, you're educated now,

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
good luck getting a job under capitalism, bye!

08:17.000 --> 08:19.000
And that really kinda sucks.

08:19.000 --> 08:23.000
But you know, I think that's a point that could probably be made

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
without comparing transgender activism to Stalin.

08:28.000 --> 08:31.000
I feel like this came across a little more sarcastic than I intended.

08:31.000 --> 08:34.000
See, this is why you've got to use a firmer hand with me, Peterson.

08:34.000 --> 08:37.000
If you don't establish dominance, I'm just gonna mouth off.

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
They use all this compassion language,

08:40.000 --> 08:42.000
and I'm on the side of the oppressed.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.000
They use all of that posturing.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
It does nothing but mask the underlying drive to power.

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
And I've just been starting to review their curriculum

08:50.000 --> 08:52.000
for children from kindergarten to grade eight.

08:52.000 --> 08:55.000
It's pure social justice postmodernism.

08:55.000 --> 08:58.000
The people who hold this doctrine,

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
this radical postmodern communitarian doctrine

09:01.000 --> 09:05.000
that makes racial identity or sexual identity or gender identity

09:05.000 --> 09:07.000
or some kind of group identity paramount,

09:07.000 --> 09:11.000
they've got control over the most low-committing,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
low-to-mid-level bureaucratic structures.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
And many governments as well.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
But even in the United States, where, you know, a lot of...

09:41.000 --> 09:42.000
I don't know.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
So you've got to give it to J.P.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.000
When he says,

09:52.000 --> 09:54.000
stand up straight with your shoulders back,

09:54.000 --> 09:55.000
he means it.

09:55.000 --> 09:58.000
So Jordan Peterson has succeeded largely by drawing in audiences

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
with fairly popular opinions.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Political correctness often feels stifling.

10:02.000 --> 10:06.000
Student activists are sometimes inarticulate and overreactive.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.000
Angry transsexuals are telling me what words to use,

10:08.000 --> 10:09.000
and I don't like it.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.000
But once he draws you in

10:10.000 --> 10:12.000
with these inviting preludes,

10:12.000 --> 10:14.000
he leads you to a pretty weird place.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
His central political message is that

10:16.000 --> 10:18.000
leftist professors, student activists,

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
campus diversity initiatives,

10:20.000 --> 10:22.000
and corporate HR departments

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
are collectively following the philosophy

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
of postmodern neo-Marxism

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
to destroy Western civilization

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
and sink us all into a totalitarian nightmare.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.000
Now there's just no avoiding that this idea

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
is actually pretty similar to the cultural Marxism

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
or cultural Bolshevism theory.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.000
But I'm just going to repeat it.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
So ignore that,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.000
because if I dwell on it,

10:42.000 --> 10:45.000
I'll sound like I'm saying Peterson is a fascist,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
and then everyone will think I'm crazy.

10:47.000 --> 10:50.000
Look, I'm not afraid of psychologists.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.000
I don't have anything to hide.

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
So let's just try not to think about that,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.000
and instead straightforwardly ask,

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
is it true that postmodern neo-Marxism

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
is out to destroy us all?

11:00.000 --> 11:03.000
Well, why don't we analyze the concept of postmodern neo-Marxism?

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
We all know what Marxism is,

11:05.000 --> 11:07.000
the idea that society should be understood

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
as a class struggle between workers and capitalists,

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
and that the workers will eventually revolt.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.000
Some college professors definitely do believe that,

11:13.000 --> 11:16.000
but 0% of corporate HR departments do,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
so that...

11:18.000 --> 11:19.000
Okay.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
So what is postmodernism?

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
Well, it's the vaguest word in the English language.

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Some people try to explain it

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
by listing all the things that are called postmodern,

11:27.000 --> 11:30.000
and then trying to guess what they have in common.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
That's basically what the YouTuber Armored Skeptic

11:32.000 --> 11:33.000
did in his video about it.

11:33.000 --> 11:35.000
So many daddies in this video.

11:35.000 --> 11:37.000
We should invite them all to a barbecue,

11:37.000 --> 11:38.000
complain about postmodernism,

11:38.000 --> 11:40.000
listen to some Zeppelin.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
I've had worse evenings.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
I don't think there really is a common thread

11:43.000 --> 11:45.000
linking all the things called postmodern.

11:45.000 --> 11:48.000
Basically, postmodernism is everything that happened after 1945

11:48.000 --> 11:49.000
that seemed new at the time.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
But when Jordan Peterson says postmodernism,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.000
he's not talking about Andy Warhol or Quentin Tarantino.

11:54.000 --> 11:57.000
He's talking about postmodern philosophy.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
So what's that?

11:58.000 --> 11:59.000
Well...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Basically, it's a kind of skepticism.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
Not YouTube skepticism,

12:03.000 --> 12:04.000
but actual skepticism.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
You know, like having doubts

12:06.000 --> 12:08.000
about whether humans can really know things.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.000
Now skepticism is obviously not a new idea.

12:11.000 --> 12:13.000
That goes way back to ancient times.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.000
But more specifically,

12:15.000 --> 12:18.000
postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.000
So what's modernism?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
What's what?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.000
What are words?

12:21.000 --> 12:22.000
What's anything?

12:22.000 --> 12:24.000
I'm going to divide modernism into two periods

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
because I feel like it.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
First, there's early modernism.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.000
Early modernism is the philosophy developed

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
by a bunch of boring 18th century queens

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
which says that we can form universal theories

12:33.000 --> 12:36.000
about the world through observation and reasoning,

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
aka the scientific method.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.000
Now that turns out to work pretty well

12:39.000 --> 12:42.000
for whatever questions you have about plants and crystals

12:42.000 --> 12:45.000
and how to medically reconfigure human genitals,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
but it has some limits,

12:47.000 --> 12:49.000
which was pointed out by David Hume,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.000
one of the least boring 18th century queens

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
and one of the only philosophers

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
I can actually put up with in small doses

12:55.000 --> 12:57.000
even though he was a fucking racist

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
and also Scottish.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
This is a callout.

12:59.000 --> 13:02.000
Hume argued that from a strictly empirical perspective,

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
you can't really know much about important things

13:05.000 --> 13:06.000
like morality, causation,

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
and the self

13:08.000 --> 13:11.000
because those aren't the kinds of things you can observe.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Anyway, then the late modernists came along

13:13.000 --> 13:14.000
and they said,

13:14.000 --> 13:15.000
fuck Hume,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
we're going to do science about those things anyway.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
So the late modernists were a bunch of boring 19th century neckbeards

13:20.000 --> 13:21.000
who, one way or another,

13:21.000 --> 13:25.000
tried to discover universal scientific truths about humans.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
So for example, you have psychoanalysis,

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
which said human nature can be understood

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
in terms of unconscious drives,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
which is of course ridiculous.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
I'm conscious of all my drives.

13:35.000 --> 13:36.000
And you got Marxism,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.000
with its analysis of bourgeoisie and proletariat.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.000
You got early sociology and anthropology,

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
which started out with racist social evolutionism

13:43.000 --> 13:45.000
and progressed to a kind of

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
we're all the same universalism.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
Jordan Peterson is right at home with the late modernists.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
His first book, Maps of Meaning,

13:51.000 --> 13:54.000
is an attempt to describe how humans make sense of the world

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
and create order out of chaos

13:56.000 --> 13:58.000
through universal myths and archetypes,

13:58.000 --> 14:02.000
which he claims are a product of our species' evolutionary past.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.000
Boy, this is a lot of explaining.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.000
It's so much explaining,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
it's triggering gender dysphoria.

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
I better put on some longer nails.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.000
Nails?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Is that all womanhood means to you?

14:15.000 --> 14:18.000
Postmodernism is skepticism about modernism.

14:18.000 --> 14:21.000
So whereas modernists try to create eternal and universal theories

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
about reality, history, and humanity,

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
postmodernists say,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
actually, no, that's not possible.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
For example, the French postmodernist

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
Michel Foucault

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
Sargon?

14:32.000 --> 14:34.000
You little goose.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
Michel Foucault

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
wrote intellectual histories of subjects

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
like psychiatry, medicine, and criminal justice,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.000
in which he argued that we should not understand these histories

14:42.000 --> 14:46.000
as straightforward progressions toward liberty and scientific truth,

14:46.000 --> 14:49.000
but rather as mere shifts in the way that power

14:49.000 --> 14:52.000
orders our institutions and populations.

14:52.000 --> 14:55.000
The other postmodernist I've actually read a lot of is Richard Rorty.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.000
Yeah, fuck you, Derrida.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.000
If you wanted me to read you, you should have been easier to read.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.000
Rorty advocates an attitude toward knowledge he calls ironism,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
irony being the skeptical caution

15:03.000 --> 15:06.000
with which we should regard our own beliefs and our awareness

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
that our vocabulary for describing and understanding the world

15:09.000 --> 15:12.000
is not the final or best vocabulary.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.000
Alright, that's enough explaining.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.000
And my nails are done. Check it out.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.000
Do you enjoy having long, glamorous nails

15:18.000 --> 15:21.000
but do lesbians and queer girls keep glaring at them

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
with barely concealed visceral rage?

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
Well, I have a solution for you.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
The bisexual manicure.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
One hand for the V, one hand for the D.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Both for degeneracy.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
It's absolutely filthy.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.000
So we've got all the pieces on the table.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Now we've just got to put the puzzle together.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
On the one hand, we have Marxism,

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
a fundamentally modernist worldview

15:41.000 --> 15:44.000
that theorizes the human condition in economic terms.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.000
On the other hand, we have postmodernism,

15:46.000 --> 15:49.000
a skeptical worldview that denies our capacity

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
to know any universal truths about anything.

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
On the face of it, it would seem these two ideas are not compatible.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
And there is an extensive history of dispute between them,

15:57.000 --> 16:00.000
with, for instance, the Marxist Sartre

16:00.000 --> 16:01.000
calling Foucault

16:01.000 --> 16:04.000
the last barricade the bourgeoisie can erect against Marx.

16:04.000 --> 16:07.000
And of course, as we all know, when Foucault died,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
capitalism did end forever.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.000
So where does Peterson get off talking about postmodern neo-Marxism?

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
Well, it's true that a lot of postmodernists

16:18.000 --> 16:20.000
were in some way influenced by Marxism,

16:20.000 --> 16:23.000
so the phrase could just refer to that continuity.

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
But that's not what Peterson means.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It's clear from the way he uses the term

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
that the concept is even more jumbled and nonsensical

16:29.000 --> 16:30.000
than it initially appears.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
Peterson uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
to include not only postmodern intellectuals

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
and Marxist intellectuals,

16:37.000 --> 16:40.000
but also liberal politicians, academic administrators,

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
and corporate HR departments that care about diversity,

16:43.000 --> 16:46.000
and so-called identity politics activists,

16:46.000 --> 16:49.000
including feminists, LGBT, and civil rights activists.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
Basically, it's the entirety of the modern left.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.000
Now, I've already mentioned how Marxism and postmodernism

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
are fundamentally at odds,

16:56.000 --> 16:58.000
since Marxism is a big story about a struggle

16:58.000 --> 17:00.000
between two clear and distinct groups,

17:00.000 --> 17:04.000
and postmodernism is skepticism about big stories like this,

17:04.000 --> 17:06.000
and about the stability of binaries

17:06.000 --> 17:08.000
like bourgeoisie and proletariat.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
But that's not the only tension in Peterson's

17:10.000 --> 17:13.000
clusterfuck idea of postmodern neo-Marxism.

17:13.000 --> 17:16.000
Anyone with any experience in leftist circles knows

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
that Marxists and identity politics activists

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
are constantly at each other's throats,

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
because the Marxists accuse the activists

17:22.000 --> 17:26.000
of being bourgeois dogs who want more female CEOs of color

17:26.000 --> 17:28.000
and more disabled transgender drone pilots,

17:28.000 --> 17:30.000
while the activists accuse the Marxists

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
of being a boys' club of brocialists

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
no more woke on gender and race issues

17:34.000 --> 17:36.000
than the average Jordan Peterson fan.

17:36.000 --> 17:38.000
Most often, these accusations are correct,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
because everyone is problematic,

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
and I disown them all.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.000
And then there's also the conflict

17:44.000 --> 17:46.000
between the identity politics activists

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
and the postmodernists.

17:47.000 --> 17:50.000
Why does everyone think that identity politics is postmodern?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
There's nothing postmodern about it.

17:52.000 --> 17:55.000
Identity politics advocates for rights, equality, and justice,

17:55.000 --> 17:58.000
for particular groups, such as women, people of color,

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
and gay and trans people.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
This kind of activism presupposes

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
that these group categories exist

18:04.000 --> 18:07.000
and are a useful basis for political organizing.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.000
Postmodernists do kind of the opposite.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.000
They want to show that these categories

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
race, gender, sexual orientation,

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
are contingent social constructs

18:15.000 --> 18:18.000
and are themselves potentially oppressive.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
This is why conventional feminist activists

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
often hate postmodern feminism.

18:22.000 --> 18:24.000
Because the postmodern feminists want to show

18:24.000 --> 18:27.000
that the whole concept of womanhood, for instance,

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
is contingent and potentially oppressive,

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
and they think we should be working to destabilize

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
and undermine it.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
And then the conventional feminist activists say,

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
the fuck?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
We need the concept of womanhood

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
to organize around women's political interests.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.000
How are we supposed to do that

18:41.000 --> 18:44.000
if we undermine and destabilize the concept of womanhood?

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
And in turn, the postmodern feminists say,

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
well, here's a quotation from Judith Butler,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.000
the most famous postmodern feminist ever.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.000
Is it not a sign of despair over public politics

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
when identity becomes its own policy,

18:55.000 --> 18:57.000
bringing with it those who would police it

18:57.000 --> 18:59.000
from various sides?

18:59.000 --> 19:01.000
And this is not a call to return to silence

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
or invisibility,

19:02.000 --> 19:04.000
but rather to make use of a category

19:04.000 --> 19:06.000
that can be called into question,

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
made to account for what it excludes.

19:09.000 --> 19:11.000
If you take the first part of that quote out of context,

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
it almost sounds like something

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
Jordan Peterson could have said.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
The difference is that J.P. actually does think

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
we should return to silence and invisibility.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.000
Or does he?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
It's hard to tell what he thinks.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
More on that in a moment.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.000
I bring all of this up to show that

19:25.000 --> 19:28.000
1 the idea of postmodern neo-Marxist identity politics

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
as a unifying concept of the left is nonsensical

19:31.000 --> 19:35.000
and 2 identity politics is not this dogma

19:35.000 --> 19:37.000
that must go unquestioned.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.000
There are sophisticated debates about this

19:39.000 --> 19:41.000
going on within leftist academia,

19:41.000 --> 19:43.000
but Jordan Peterson either doesn't know that

19:43.000 --> 19:44.000
or doesn't care.

19:44.000 --> 19:47.000
He uses the term postmodern neo-Marxism

19:47.000 --> 19:50.000
to characterize the left as a unified philosophical force

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
bent on destroying Western civilization

19:52.000 --> 19:54.000
when in fact it's a bunch of bumbling buffoons

19:54.000 --> 19:56.000
who can't stop squabbling with each other

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
over every goddamn little issue.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
The only reason I can think of

20:00.000 --> 20:03.000
that the left would appear to be a unified philosophical force

20:03.000 --> 20:05.000
is if you're so far to the right

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
that literally everyone who supports

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
the economic and social advancement of disadvantaged groups

20:10.000 --> 20:12.000
looks like one homogenous enemy.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
But is that what Jordan Peterson is saying?

20:14.000 --> 20:16.000
That he opposes all social progress

20:16.000 --> 20:18.000
for women, racial, and sexual minorities?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Well, it's difficult to say

20:20.000 --> 20:22.000
because while he spends much of his time

20:22.000 --> 20:24.000
comparing activists for these movements

20:24.000 --> 20:26.000
to 20th century mass murderers,

20:26.000 --> 20:28.000
he resists being pinned down

20:28.000 --> 20:30.000
to any more specific position.

20:30.000 --> 20:32.000
I was maybe too harsh on Cathy Newman earlier.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.000
She came out of that interview looking bad,

20:34.000 --> 20:36.000
but she had a tough job to do.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.000
Peterson's rhetorical strategy involves

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
saying something that's more or less

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
uncontroversially true,

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
while at the same time implying something controversial.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.000
For instance, Jordan Peterson will make a claim like

20:47.000 --> 20:50.000
there are biological differences between men and women,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.000
which is obviously true.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
But he'll say it in the context of a conversation

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
about the underrepresentation of women in government,

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
which implies...

20:58.000 --> 20:59.000
what exactly?

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
So how do you respond to this?

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Well, either you fall into the trap of arguing

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
against the obviously true statement,

21:05.000 --> 21:07.000
or you have to guess at what he's implying,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.000
in response to which he can accuse you

21:09.000 --> 21:11.000
of misrepresenting him,

21:11.000 --> 21:14.000
which is exactly what happened with the Cathy Newman interview.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
The most famous moment where Peterson does this

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
is the notorious lobster argument.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.000
So he starts by saying,

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
There's this idea.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.000
There's this idea that hierarchical structures

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
are a sociological construct of the Western patriarchy.

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
And then he goes on to say that lobsters exist in hierarchies,

21:30.000 --> 21:34.000
and lobsters predate Western patriarchy by millions of years,

21:34.000 --> 21:37.000
so checkmate postmodern neo-Marxists.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.000
You're saying that we should organize our societies

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
along the lines of the lobsters.

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
I'm saying that it's inevitable that there will be continuity

21:45.000 --> 21:48.000
in the way that animals and human beings organize their structures.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.000
The problem with that is that,

21:50.000 --> 21:53.000
no one has ever said that every hierarchy

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
is the product of Western patriarchy.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
This is such a massive straw man

21:57.000 --> 22:00.000
that it overshadows any uncharitable interpretation

22:00.000 --> 22:03.000
of Peterson suggested by Cathy Newman in this interview.

22:03.000 --> 22:07.000
No one on the left denies that there are some natural hierarchies.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.000
Even the anarchists, whose whole thing is abolishing hierarchies,

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
limit themselves to the abolition of unjust hierarchies.

22:14.000 --> 22:17.000
No one wants to abolish lobster hierarchies.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.000
The hierarchies we're interested in are those of gender,

22:19.000 --> 22:22.000
race, and economics within our own society,

22:22.000 --> 22:25.000
to which the lobster case is a complete non sequitur.

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
I mean, you could use Peterson's lobster argument

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
the same way he uses it

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
to justify literally any hierarchy or authority,

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
no matter how unjust.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
You could be an 18th century Republican

22:36.000 --> 22:38.000
arguing against the monarchy,

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
and the monarch could turn around and say,

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
well, hierarchies are inevitable.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
God save the lobster queen.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Oh dear God.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
My lords.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Ladies.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.000
And those at life betwixt.

22:51.000 --> 22:54.000
Present rumors and Republican rumblings

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
amongst the rabble

22:55.000 --> 22:58.000
have compelled us to summon you together.

22:58.000 --> 23:01.000
Let us remind you that nature

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
hath so made the lobster

23:03.000 --> 23:07.000
that some individuals be stronger than the others.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.000
Therefore, let not the power of our crustacean sovereignty

23:12.000 --> 23:15.000
be anywise impugned.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.000
And as for parliamentarians,

23:17.000 --> 23:22.000
well, let them vote for cake.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.000
Very good. Thank you.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.000
I need new roommates.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.000
So I've argued that Peterson is evoking

23:33.000 --> 23:36.000
the incoherent concept of postmodern neo-Marxism

23:36.000 --> 23:39.000
as the supervillain in a childishly simple worldview

23:39.000 --> 23:41.000
he's promoting where these evil leftists

23:41.000 --> 23:43.000
are out to destroy the West.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
Now, it's time to inspect the other side of this coin.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.000
What, exactly, is the West?

23:48.000 --> 23:51.000
Well, there's an academic usage of the term the West

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
that describes the intellectual tradition

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
that runs from ancient Athens to modern-day Europe and its colonies.

23:57.000 --> 23:59.000
Now, a true postmodernist would want to deconstruct

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
the whole concept of the West

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
and show how the very idea is racist and exclusionary

24:04.000 --> 24:07.000
and supremacist and justifies imperialism

24:07.000 --> 24:08.000
and all that kind of thing.

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
But we don't have time for that right now.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
So I'm just gonna grant that the West is a thing

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
and look at how Jordan Peterson thinks about it.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
For Peterson,

24:15.000 --> 24:19.000
the West seems to be equivalent to capitalism, individualism,

24:19.000 --> 24:22.000
the idea that each human has a spark of divinity,

24:22.000 --> 24:25.000
and he therefore equates it with Judeo-Christian values,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
a term more popular with conservative pundits

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
than intellectual historians.

24:30.000 --> 24:32.000
Peterson contrasts Judeo-Christian values

24:32.000 --> 24:34.000
with postmodern neo-Marxism,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
which he describes as anti-Western,

24:36.000 --> 24:39.000
collectivist, relativist, and totalitarian.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
This framing of a conflict of ideas

24:41.000 --> 24:44.000
in terms of geographical chauvinism and external threat

24:44.000 --> 24:47.000
is inaccurate and scaremongering.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
Marxism is Western philosophy.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.000
Postmodernism is Western philosophy.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
If you're really concerned about preserving

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
the geographical boundaries of the intellectual tradition,

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
you should be ranting against the influence of Buddhism.

24:59.000 --> 25:02.000
Likewise, there is no feature of SJW ideology

25:02.000 --> 25:04.000
that is meaningfully non-Western.

25:04.000 --> 25:07.000
The very idea of people requesting different pronouns

25:07.000 --> 25:09.000
to suit their individual needs

25:09.000 --> 25:11.000
is exactly the kind of thing

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
a person who values individual liberty

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
over collective dogma should be on board with.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
You could even argue that Marxism

25:17.000 --> 25:19.000
is an extension of Enlightenment philosophy,

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
with its concern for human progress,

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
science, and liberty.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.000
I think a lot of people like listening to Jordan Peterson

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
talk about the Western tradition,

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
but they don't seem to like reading any of it themselves.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.000
If you did read it,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.000
you'd find a surprising diversity of thought

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
that doesn't reduce to Judeo-Christian values.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
Much of Plato's political dialogues

25:39.000 --> 25:42.000
are concerned with arguing against cultural relativism,

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
suggesting that,

25:43.000 --> 25:46.000
far from being an invention of postmodernity,

25:46.000 --> 25:48.000
it was actually a pretty popular worldview

25:48.000 --> 25:50.000
among ancient Athenian pederasts.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.000
Our favorite Enlightenment philosopher David Hume

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
famously said that reason is,

25:55.000 --> 25:57.000
and ought only to be,

25:57.000 --> 25:59.000
the slave of the passions,

25:59.000 --> 26:01.000
literally, feels over reals.

26:01.000 --> 26:04.000
And meanwhile, his contemporary, the Marquis de Sade,

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
was advocating the abolition of morality,

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
filling the churches with scat porn,

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
and ushering in a reign of untethered sexual perversion

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
so decadent and depraved,

26:13.000 --> 26:16.000
I'm not even allowed to talk about it on YouTube.

26:16.000 --> 26:19.000
This is the Enlightenment, not postmodernism,

26:19.000 --> 26:21.000
and it's just as much a part of the West

26:21.000 --> 26:24.000
as Peterson's soggy, Bible-padding conservatism.

26:24.000 --> 26:28.000
But again, and I really can't stress this enough,

26:28.000 --> 26:30.000
I don't care either way.

26:30.000 --> 26:34.000
I make YouTube videos because I enjoy mood lighting and set design.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.000
So what do you people want from me?

26:36.000 --> 26:39.000
The lobster queen is dead. Long live the queen.

26:41.000 --> 26:46.000
TO BE CONTINUED

27:11.000 --> 27:40.220
I think you would agree

27:40.220 --> 27:41.720
that there's just a foundational erosion

27:41.720 --> 27:44.180
that I think people of all sides,

27:44.220 --> 27:46.260
and I think there's totally intellectually smart people

27:46.260 --> 27:47.580
on the far left that can help.

27:49.220 --> 27:50.060
Where are those people?

27:50.220 --> 27:55.200
There's a YouTuber that I'm actually quite interested in

27:55.200 --> 27:58.040
that I watch her, and I don't mean to misgender her

27:58.040 --> 28:00.600
because I think she identifies with her, ContraPoints.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.980
I don't know if you've heard of this YouTuber

28:01.980 --> 28:03.140
who's on the far left.

28:03.160 --> 28:04.680
I've seen the name come up every now and again on Twitter.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.180
Totally disagree with everything this person says,

28:07.380 --> 28:08.400
but I look at it and I'm like,

28:08.460 --> 28:09.920
this seems very reasonable, educated,

28:10.040 --> 28:10.200
academic, and I'm like,

28:10.220 --> 28:14.260
and I'm seeing reasons to hope

28:14.260 --> 28:15.420
that everyone's going to come together.

28:16.360 --> 28:17.760
Hello, Dave.
