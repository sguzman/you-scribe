0	29980	Thank you for watching.
30000	59980	I'll see you in the next one.
60000	62540	It's probably the most effective approach eventually,
63400	65140	but the problem is that it's hard
65140	67280	and I don't like things that are hard.
69500	71380	Because when you do things that are hard,
71540	74960	you have to feel bad now so that you can feel good later.
75360	76820	And I don't want to feel good later.
77140	78680	I want to feel good now.
78880	80320	And if you want to feel good now,
80520	82260	well, you have a couple options.
82560	84980	The first is, of course, to do drugs.
85160	86060	And I've tried that.
86340	89320	I spent most of my 20s on the threshold of alcoholism,
89320	91700	but it turns out that's not a cute look for me.
91800	92680	It's not my vibe.
93040	95600	So what I do now when I feel the darkness coming
95600	98200	is what any respectable woman would do.
98600	102260	I take a Xanax and lie on the floor for a couple hours.
102520	104920	Is it a pee under my mattress, your majesty?
105220	108120	Or is it another Xanax I left under the throat rug?
108300	109520	Now, the problem with doing drugs
109520	112460	is that when the drugs wear off, you feel bad again.
112580	115140	In fact, you probably feel worse.
115380	116800	So where do we go from here?
117220	119220	Well, how about music?
119320	122280	When you feel bad, you want to listen to sad music
122280	124920	because sad music makes you cry.
125320	127460	And crying feels good.
127800	130280	It's like an orgasm for sad people.
130540	133600	And why settle for less than the official meme song of sadness?
134060	136540	The Sound of Silence by Simon and Garfunkel.
136760	139620	You know, I'm pretty sure there's another Xanax
139620	140840	under this throat rug.
141540	143820	Hello, darkness, my old friend.
145040	148040	But in the memes, you only hear the first 10 seconds of the song.
148040	148960	You only hear,
149320	150820	Hello, darkness, my old friend.
150820	153440	And that's a very sad first 10 seconds of a song,
153440	154480	which is good,
154480	156800	because if you're making songs for sad people,
156800	160740	it's important to establish your sadness cred up front.
160740	163880	Because sad people don't like happy songs.
163880	165100	When you're sad,
165100	168820	happy songs make you feel like you're being bullshitted.
168820	170580	So we're 10 seconds into the song,
170580	172260	Hello, darkness, my old friend.
172260	176060	The key is D sharp minor, the saddest of all keys.
176060	177720	But when we get to the next line,
177720	179320	because of vision softly creeping,
179320	181220	something happens.
181220	182060	Let's listen.
182060	187260	I've come to talk with you again
187260	190880	Because a vision softly creeping
190880	192060	Ah!
192060	193480	What was that?
193480	195260	Suddenly a major chord,
195260	198440	an unsuspected burst of sunlight through the clouds,
198440	200760	and every peach fuzz hair on the back
200760	204200	of my biologically female neck stands on end.
204200	205700	Hello, light.
205700	207280	So the song has enticed me
207280	209160	with its promise of company for misery,
209160	213040	and then it has tricked me into feeling good.
213040	214600	And that's what I like about art.
214600	216420	It takes the standard disappointments
216420	217840	and humiliations of life
217840	219660	and cooks them into something worth
219660	221100	getting off the floor for.
221100	223520	Unfortunately, I don't really play music much anymore
223520	226420	because my hands are too beautiful for instruments
226420	228240	and my singing voice sounds like a man.
228240	231540	So all I really have left is what any aspiring artist
231540	234060	with no talent turns to, comedy.
234060	236760	And I especially like dark comedy.
236760	239060	You know, comedy about the things in life
239060	240440	that are the most painful.
240440	243380	To me, dark humor is kind of like a sad song.
243380	246140	It takes your worst feelings, traumas, and anxieties
246140	248660	and twists them into a source of pleasure.
248660	251660	And don't all the finest pleasures come from pain?
251660	252500	Ah!
252500	255060	A lot of the time, that means joking about topics
255060	257480	that in ordinary life are considered taboo.
257480	261760	You know, sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.
261760	263620	Without the ability to joke and make fun
263620	265720	of my own experiences of self-loathing,
265720	268200	substance abuse, gender dysphoria,
268200	268640	I mean, I'd probably be the one to say,
268640	270340	I'd probably be on the floor right now
270340	271960	looking for that Xanax.
271960	274220	But this puts me in a difficult situation
274220	276060	because I want to defend my sense of humor,
276060	278580	which I feel is like the core of my personality
278580	279880	and what keeps me alive.
279880	282760	But at the same time, I've noticed that a lot of the people
282760	285940	in our culture who are really big on defending provocative,
285940	288840	controversial, politically incorrect comedy
288840	292400	are kind of dick nuggets.
292400	293640	Let's discuss this.
293640	295880	And by discuss, I mean use it quietly
295880	297960	and I'll tell you what to think.
297960	300580	Two, dick nuggets.
300580	302720	So the year 2016 had just begun
302720	305900	and already the most 2016 possible thing was happening.
305900	309920	Ricky Gervais, an irreverent, bad boy, atheist comedian,
309920	312100	was ranting on Twitter for days and days
312100	315780	about how stupid it is that people are offended by things.
315780	317540	This is pretty standard for Ricky Gervais,
317540	319380	a man whose personal branding screams,
319380	321660	I don't care about your feelings.
321660	325200	I know what it's like to be persecuted for my beliefs.
325200	327300	I am too much of a badass rebel
327300	329720	to care what minorities think.
329720	334380	But in January 2016, Ricky Gervais was having an extra badass,
334380	338480	irreverent, not caring about your feelings kind of month.
338480	339540	Why?
339540	342200	Because he'd just hosted the Golden Globes
342200	344440	and upset a bunch of people by telling jokes
344440	346800	about old Tran Ma Caitlyn Jenner.
346800	348560	But as I say, I'm gonna be nice tonight.
348560	349860	I've changed.
350820	354100	Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.
354100	356020	That's cutting edge material there, Rick.
356020	356960	Very irreverent.
356960	358400	Very rebellious.
358400	360340	Very bad boy atheist.
360340	363500	I mean, I do wish he wouldn't deadname trans people on stage,
363500	366680	but honestly, the joke wasn't even as transphobic
366680	369200	as a lot of the stuff I've come to just expect from comics.
369200	373200	Still, I'm sure Twitter had a thing or two to say about it,
373200	375300	and Ricky spent the rest of the month tweeting
375300	378080	about how offending people is good, actually,
378080	380720	and he definitely doesn't care that people were offended.
380720	382640	But clearly, Twitter got to him,
382640	385240	because two years later, he opened his Netflix special
385240	386200	with a 13-minute bit, rehabbing, and saying,
386200	391200	and doing a series of even more, um, irreverent jokes.
391200	394200	Because I've always identified as a chimp, right?
394200	395200	Well, I am a chimp.
395200	397200	If I say I'm a chimp, I am a chimp.
397200	398200	Pre-op.
398200	402200	But, um, and don't ever deadname me.
402200	404200	Don't ever call me Ricky Gervais again.
404200	406200	From now on, you call me Bobo.
406200	409200	Does he also identify as an attack helicopter?
409200	412200	Does he realize he is doing a meme from 2014 on stage
412200	414200	in a $20 million comedy special?
414200	415320	My issue with this joke is that, you know, I don't know.
415320	419320	My issue with this joke is that, apart from being extremely pass√© and overdone,
419320	422320	it also doesn't make sense unless you ignorantly believe
422320	424320	that trans women are delusional men.
424320	427320	And even then, it's just not very funny.
427320	429320	But am I offended by the joke?
429320	434320	Well, I think it's ignorant, misinformed, unoriginal, and not very funny.
434320	437320	And as a great comedian named Ricky Gervais once said,
437320	443320	to me, an offensive joke is one that's lame, badly delivered, and not funny enough.
443320	445320	So by that measure, yes, I'd say this.
445320	448320	The fact that I identify as a chimp bit is pretty offensive.
448320	451320	But I'm not bringing this old controversy up because I'm offended.
451320	455320	I'm bringing it up because it's just an arbitrary example of a cycle
455320	458320	it seems like our culture repeats about once a week.
458320	461320	Somebody makes a joke, some people are offended by the joke,
461320	465320	and other people are indignant about the fact that those people are offended.
465320	468320	The cycle usually gets framed as a battle and a culture war
468320	471320	that's supposedly going on between generation snowflake,
471320	473320	easily triggered, humorless PC cucks,
473320	475320	and badass, edgy, nothing-off-limits,
475320	477320	free-speech truth-tellers.
477320	480320	Now if this really is a culture war between two sides,
480320	482320	then I am a double agent,
482320	486320	because I'm a generation snowflake PC cuck who loves dank, edgy memes,
486320	491320	and I've found myself on both sides of this type of conflict many, many times.
491320	494320	So on the one hand, when I see the internet roasting a comedian
494320	496320	for some shitty trans joke,
496320	499320	my inner snowflake wants to watch the bastard burn.
499320	503320	But my inner edge lady knows how it feels to be dragged across Twitter over a joke.
503320	508320	And as someone who basically writes jokes about controversial topics for a living,
508320	515320	I appreciate how difficult it is to maintain the mildly sadomasochistic character of comedy
515320	520320	while also keeping your moral compass from getting too jittery.
520320	525320	So what I want to try to do is step away from the heat of these social media battles
525320	529320	and try to abstract from them some more general philosophical questions.
529320	531320	What is the purpose of comedy?
531320	533320	What is it that makes comedy good or bad?
533320	536320	Does good comedy punch up and speak truth to power?
536320	539320	Does it bring light to some aspect of the human condition?
539320	541320	Is it, as Aristotle said,
541320	544320	the imitation of worse than average men?
544320	548320	Or is it simply anything anyone laughs at for whatever reason?
548320	550320	Well, I don't think there's a single objective answer.
550320	552320	I mean, comedy's pretty subjective.
552320	556320	But we can probably reach some kind of understanding by discussing this, right?
556320	558320	And by we,
558320	560320	again, I do mean me.
560320	563320	The rest of you can keep your goddamn mouths shut.
563320	564320	Straw men.
564320	566320	So, as a trans woman,
566320	570320	up here discussing why I don't think Ricky Gervais' trans jokes are funny,
570320	574320	a lot of haters and losers out there are probably gonna try to straw man me.
574320	579320	Did you just assume the straw person's gender?
579320	580320	Ugh!
580320	584320	Cis people have like two trans jokes and they're both so bad.
584320	586320	Here's the straw person's, assholes.
586320	588320	Straw person one.
588320	589320	You hate free speech
589320	591320	and are trying to silence comedians.
591320	593320	I'm not trying to silence anyone.
593320	596320	Comedians can say whatever they want on stage
596320	599320	and I can say whatever I want about them.
599320	601320	Straw person two.
601320	604320	You just can't take the heat when the joke's on you.
604320	606320	I transitioned on YouTube,
606320	609320	making controversial political content all the while,
609320	611320	and I read the comments.
611320	615320	My hate-taking capacity is among the highest of all time.
615320	618320	Of course, I do not have the internalized self-loathing
618320	620320	that has damaged my psyche irreparably,
620320	622320	but sweetie, who doesn't?
622320	624320	Straw person three.
624320	627320	You think no one should be allowed to joke about trans people.
627320	630320	I invented joking about trans people.
630320	632320	Ever heard of the mouth feel?
632320	633320	I'm that tran.
633320	634320	That's right.
634320	635320	If I die tomorrow,
635320	639320	my legacy will be that I applied wine-tasting terminology to fellatio,
639320	642320	and I accept my destiny.
642320	645320	Look, half my job is telling jokes about trans people.
645320	647320	I live for trans jokes.
647320	650320	I just don't think cis people are very good at telling them,
650320	652320	because they don't know enough about trans people
652320	654320	to know what the funny things are.
654320	657320	And being transgender is honestly the perfect topic for comedy.
657320	659320	Like, you used to live as one gender,
659320	661320	and then you became a different gender.
661320	664320	Every single thing about that is absolutely hilarious.
664320	666320	But humor is in the details.
666320	668320	And Ricky Gervais does not know the details,
668320	671320	because he's clearly never been close to a trans person,
671320	675320	and that's why he's still telling these Tinker Toy 2015 Caitlyn Jenner jokes.
675320	676320	And it's too bad,
676320	679320	because I'm actually starving over here for good trans comedy.
679320	681320	And I mean the real dark stuff, too.
681320	683320	I'm not talking about trans Rachel on the timeline
683320	685320	calling her hormones titty skittles.
685320	686320	No, I like the edgy stuff.
686320	688320	I like being on the edge.
688320	690320	Hi, my name is Natalie Nguyen,
690320	692320	and I enjoy edging.
692320	695320	Now, there is one recent work of trans comedy
695320	696320	that I'd like to share with you,
696320	698320	because when you're doing art criticism,
698320	701320	it helps to have positive as well as negative examples.
701320	703320	And the exemplary work I have in mind
703320	706320	is one not a lot of people are talking about yet,
706320	709320	but which I have no qualms placing in the same company
709320	711320	as the works of Dante or Swift.
711320	712320	I am, of course, referring to
712320	715320	My Sperm Bank Experience by Gigi Gorgias.
715320	717320	If you don't know who Gigi is,
717320	718320	first of all, who even are you?
718320	720320	Do you have no respect for legends?
720320	721320	She's a trans YouTuber,
721320	722320	like the trans YouTuber,
722320	725320	whose classic works such as My Hemorrhoids
725320	727320	and I Had Sex With a Dog
727320	730320	long ago cemented her status as a comedy icon.
730320	731320	But in this critic's opinion,
731320	734320	the crown jewel of Gigi's oeuvre
734320	735320	is without a doubt,
735320	738320	the singular masterpiece My Sperm Bank Experience.
738320	739320	Let's do a close reading.
739320	742320	4. Gigi's Sperm Bank Experience
742320	745320	A great work of literature is never just a text.
745320	749320	It is also what the theorist Jean-Jacques Visage du Poisson
749320	753320	would call a moment within an intertextual dialectic.
753320	754320	Love that.
754320	756320	Let us therefore place My Sperm Bank Experience
756320	758320	within its proper context.
758320	760320	Several months earlier, Gigi had released a video
760320	762320	about how she and her girlfriend
762320	763320	were trying to have a child,
763320	764320	so far without success,
764320	767320	and so they went to see a fertility specialist.
767320	769320	Apparently Gigi was not aware
769320	771320	that taking feminizing hormones can make you sterile,
771320	774320	which, girl, they tell you like seven times
774320	775320	before you start hormones.
775320	776320	Like, how?
776320	777320	We'll move past it.
777320	778320	A few months later,
778320	781320	the notification for My Sperm Bank Experience
781320	782320	shows up on my phone,
782320	783320	because that's right, I clicked the bell,
783320	786320	and immediately I knew I was about to experience
786320	787320	something special.
787320	789320	The thumbnail for this video is so much greater
789320	791320	than anything I've ever conceived of
791320	793320	that honestly it makes me feel like a failure,
793320	795320	both as a YouTuber and as a woman.
795320	798320	The sperm donation cup is labeled with Gigi's signature,
798320	800320	the eyes are dotted with hearts,
800320	802320	and her facial expression.
802320	804320	Ew.
804320	805320	Come.
805320	807320	The video begins with Gigi explaining
807320	809320	that in order to produce a sample for the clinic,
809320	812320	she had to stop taking hormones for three months.
812320	813320	So I hesitantly agreed.
813320	815320	I was like, fine, I will stop all of my hormones,
815320	818320	so, you know, my shit can get juicy again,
818320	820320	and I can get a good little sample up in here.
820320	821320	The sperm bank day arrives,
821320	822320	she goes to the clinic,
822320	824320	and approaches the receptionist.
824320	825320	And I said,
825320	826320	yes, ma'am,
826320	828320	I am here to give sperm
828320	829320	from me
829320	831320	to be frozen
831320	832320	now.
832320	834320	The doctor arrives and leads her to the exam room,
834320	836320	which she describes with the precision
836320	838320	of Mama Flaubert.
838320	839320	I walk into this room,
839320	840320	fluorescent lighting,
840320	841320	the house.
841320	843320	I was like, I can see every pore in my arm,
843320	845320	like, Jesus, what do they want me to do here?
845320	846320	And then the kicker,
846320	847320	this, like, leather couch,
847320	849320	the back is kind of, like, angled,
849320	851320	so I guess, like, you can lean
851320	853320	and really get into it or something.
853320	855320	The doctor offers her lubrication,
855320	856320	pornography if needed,
856320	857320	and a donation cup.
857320	860320	Gigi closes the door and gets to work.
860320	861320	I get in the mood,
861320	862320	I get in the zone,
862320	863320	and I'm killing it, bitch.
863320	865320	I am like, I'm gonna give the best sample ever.
865320	867320	My kid is gonna be a God-sent child.
867320	868320	Before I know it,
868320	870320	the moment has crept up on me and happened,
870320	872320	and it's been so long
872320	874320	that it hits the wall behind me.
874320	876320	And it's at this moment
876320	878320	that glam goddess Gigi Gorgeous
878320	880320	gets up off the leather couch
880320	881320	and attempts to scrape
881320	883320	a prodigious quantity of Gigi jism
883320	886320	off the wall of a fluorescent-lit exam room
886320	889320	in a desperate final bid to become a mother.
889320	890320	And I took the cup,
890320	891320	and I was, like, full-on, like,
891320	892320	scraping it off the wall,
892320	893320	because I was like,
893320	895320	I'm not gonna let any little drop go to waste.
895320	896320	You know, I'm here.
896320	897320	This is, like, my moment.
897320	898320	I'm trying to understand
898320	900320	why this video makes me laugh so much.
900320	902320	It's really the contrast of style and substance.
902320	903320	Like, it wouldn't be funny
903320	906320	if a masculine person told this story.
906320	907320	It's funny because Gigi has this
907320	909320	peak feminine storytelling style
909320	911320	in this Real Housewives diction,
911320	914320	but the story itself is about
914320	916320	blasting a giant load onto a wall
916320	918320	of a room full of leather and pornography.
918320	920320	The dissonance between form and content
920320	922320	is genius in that dissonance
922320	924320	perfectly captures the absurdity
924320	925320	of being transgender
925320	927320	with a comedic incisiveness
927320	929320	that Ricky Gervais could only dream of.
929320	931320	I also really relate to this story
931320	933320	because right before I started Hormones,
933320	935320	I decided to freeze a sample of my own
935320	938320	so I, too, have a sperm bank experience.
938320	940320	And it was exactly like Gigi describes,
940320	941320	down to every detail.
941320	943320	It is not a dignified moment, ladies.
943320	945320	There is just no way to feel like a woman
945320	947320	while you're hastily rubbing one out
947320	950320	in an over-lit room designed for men to ejaculate in.
950320	952320	I feel so fish right now.
953320	955320	For this five minutes in the exam room,
955320	956320	I was a man.
956320	958320	Now, I somehow managed to get most of my sample
958320	959320	into the cup,
959320	961320	but there's a different absurd detail to my story.
961320	963320	The receptionist at the sperm bank
963320	965320	saw on my paperwork that I was depositing
965320	967320	because I was going to start feminizing hormones.
967320	970320	And he asked me if there was a name I preferred he called me.
970320	972320	In retrospect, he was actually really sweet
972320	973320	and really cute.
973320	975320	Not that anything was going to come of that at the time,
975320	978320	since I was pretty everything and rough around the edges.
978320	979320	Be honest, I was all edges.
979320	981320	But he asked me for my preferred name,
981320	983320	and I just blurted out Natalie.
983320	985320	And so this was actually the first time
985320	987320	anyone ever called me by my biological name.
987320	988320	And it went like this.
988320	990320	The receptionist at the sperm bank
990320	991320	turned to me and said,
991320	993320	right this way, Natalie.
993320	995320	Here's a cup for you to bust a nut in.
995320	996320	And that's how it went.
996320	999320	And that's how my life as a woman began.
1000320	1001320	Now in the end,
1001320	1004320	Gigi's story is actually pretty tragic.
1004320	1006320	Her sample wasn't usable.
1006320	1008320	She wanted to have a child with her own DNA,
1008320	1010320	but she's been on hormones too long,
1010320	1011320	and she just can't.
1011320	1013320	And that revelation at the end of the video
1013320	1015320	kind of recontextualizes how you see the whole story.
1015320	1017320	In this ridiculous image of Gigi
1017320	1019320	scraping ejaculate off the wall,
1019320	1021320	I now see this primal maternal urge
1021320	1023320	to produce and protect children.
1023320	1025320	I see a mother bird whose chicks have fallen
1025320	1027320	prematurely from the nest.
1027320	1029320	I see the Virgin Mary cradling her child.
1029320	1032320	I really, really thought that I was going to have
1032320	1034320	a good sample and I was going to be able to participate
1034320	1036320	in having a baby with my DNA,
1036320	1038320	but it's just not on the cards for me.
1038320	1040320	And I really wanted to make this video more positive
1040320	1042320	and funny because there is nothing I can do.
1042320	1044320	And that's exactly it.
1044320	1046320	That is the darkness.
1049320	1051320	The darkness is my name for what I consider
1051320	1053320	the highest form of comedy,
1053320	1055320	where you take your own worst feelings,
1055320	1057320	traumas, and anxieties,
1057320	1059320	and twist them into a source of pleasure.
1059320	1061320	The darkness is Richard Pryor
1061320	1063320	running down the street in flames
1063320	1065320	because he set himself on fire in a coke-fueled psychosis.
1065320	1067320	The darkness is Gigi Gorgeous
1067320	1069320	scraping her own prodigious jism
1069320	1071320	off the wall of an exam room
1071320	1073320	in a desperate bid to save her chance at motherhood.
1073320	1075320	If you can make these low points funny,
1075320	1077320	then you're gonna be okay.
1077320	1078320	You're gonna survive.
1078320	1079320	You're gonna make it through life.
1079320	1081320	And I need that now more than ever
1081320	1083320	because trans experience is,
1083320	1085320	in a lot of ways, pretty dark.
1085320	1087320	But trans people make it through because
1087320	1089320	we're good-humored and strong as fuck.
1089320	1091320	Pretty soon, I'm gonna have to stop hormones
1091320	1093320	before an operation, and I'm terrified of that.
1093320	1095320	What's gonna happen to me when I stop hormones?
1095320	1097320	Am I gonna become a man again?
1097320	1099320	Because I don't know if I can handle that.
1099320	1101320	I am thinking about names, though.
1101320	1103320	Like, maybe Nathan? Or Jaden?
1103320	1105320	I can see myself as a Jaden.
1105320	1107320	See, I've gotta have my little jokey jokes,
1107320	1109320	or I don't think I can make it through this.
1109320	1111320	Like, when I have bottom surgery,
1111320	1113320	I am absolutely going to constantly refer to it as
1113320	1115320	my sex change operation.
1115320	1117320	Because it makes me laugh. It brings me joy.
1117320	1119320	Calling it gender confirmation surgery
1119320	1121320	brings me no joy.
1121320	1123320	Now, it's important to notice that just because
1123320	1125320	it doesn't make me laugh doesn't mean
1125320	1127320	it's a politically correct euphemism.
1127320	1129320	Gender confirmation is a more accurate term
1129320	1131320	than sex change, because
1131320	1133320	you're literally not changing your sex.
1133320	1135320	That's not what surgery does.
1135320	1137320	But edgy people have their own kind of political
1137320	1139320	correctness, where they mistake
1139320	1141320	edginess for honesty, accuracy,
1141320	1143320	and directness. But these are very
1143320	1145320	different things. For example,
1145320	1147320	George Carlin has a classic bit about euphemisms
1147320	1149320	that has some great moments,
1149320	1151320	but also some moments that are
1151320	1153320	way off-base. For example,
1153320	1155320	content wording ableist slur.
1155320	1157320	They say they're going to pre-board those
1157320	1159320	passengers in need of special assistance.
1159320	1161320	Cripples!
1163320	1165320	Simple, honest, direct language!
1165320	1167320	So look, I understand the aesthetic
1167320	1169320	preference for simple, honest, direct
1169320	1171320	language, and the repulsion toward
1171320	1173320	verbose, bureaucratic jargon. That's why
1173320	1175320	so much of the rest of this bit is so good.
1175320	1177320	But the word he just used is literally
1177320	1179320	a slur, so I wonder if what you're being honest
1179320	1181320	about is your feelings toward disabled
1181320	1183320	people. Because the phrase passengers
1183320	1185320	in need of special assistance is a little wordy,
1185320	1187320	sure, but in this situation
1187320	1189320	it's actually more accurate, since it also
1189320	1191320	includes the elderly, the pregnant, anyone
1191320	1193320	in need of assistance boarding.
1193320	1195320	So I call my gender confirmation surgery
1195320	1197320	getting a sex change, not because it's more
1197320	1199320	direct and honest, but specifically
1199320	1201320	because it's inaccurate and outdated.
1201320	1203320	And that makes me laugh.
1203320	1205320	Not because I'm a fearless truth teller, but
1205320	1207320	because I'm a bad person.
1207320	1209320	And I get to call it my sex change operation,
1209320	1211320	but cis people don't get to call it
1211320	1213320	that, because it's my darkness,
1213320	1215320	not yours. Get your
1215320	1217320	own darkness. When Ricky Gervais jokes about
1217320	1219320	trans people, he's being a hack,
1219320	1221320	because he knows nothing of our darkness.
1221320	1223320	And when someone tries to joke about something that they're
1223320	1225320	totally ignorant of, the result is usually
1225320	1227320	clumsy, awkward, and not very
1227320	1229320	funny. What I'd really like to see is
1229320	1231320	if Ricky Gervais took all of that irreverent
1231320	1233320	bad boy derisiveness and
1233320	1235320	turned it within. Because
1235320	1237320	within is where the darkness
1237320	1239320	lies.
1241320	1243320	Self-deprecating humor is my personal favorite
1243320	1245320	because as a lazy, selfish,
1245320	1247320	preening attention whore
1247320	1249320	who looks like a slightly more passable Ann Coulter
1249320	1251320	with the voice of a tropical bird,
1251320	1253320	there's a lot of material here to work with.
1253320	1255320	But especially when it comes to the trans jokes,
1255320	1257320	there is a faction of the
1257320	1259320	trans community that is not
1259320	1261320	amused by the buffoonery that goes on
1261320	1263320	on this channel. I think the objection
1263320	1265320	to it is best summed up by the comic
1265320	1267320	artist Diana Gadsby, who in her stand-up special
1267320	1269320	Nanette, said that when
1269320	1271320	self-deprecation comes from someone who
1271320	1273320	exists in the margins,
1273320	1275320	It's not humility.
1275320	1277320	It's humiliation.
1277320	1279320	And to be honest, I felt a little
1279320	1281320	called out by that.
1281320	1283320	I put myself down in order to speak.
1283320	1285320	In order to seek permission
1285320	1287320	to speak.
1287320	1289320	And she's not wrong, like that is how this works.
1289320	1291320	In order to gain an audience as a trans
1291320	1293320	person, you have to demonstrate
1293320	1295320	what cis people call self-awareness.
1295320	1297320	That is, you have to signal
1297320	1299320	that you see yourself the way
1299320	1301320	the audience sees you.
1301320	1303320	Which can mean looking at yourself with a pretty
1303320	1305320	merciless gaze. And of course I'm
1305320	1307320	happy to do that, cause I have no
1307320	1309320	self-respect and laughter is the only way
1309320	1311320	to numb the pain. But the terrible thing
1311320	1313320	about being a not normal with an audience
1313320	1315320	is that you don't just get to be yourself.
1315320	1317320	Because whether you like it or not,
1317320	1319320	people will see you as a
1319320	1321320	representative of the community.
1321320	1323320	Ugh.
1323320	1325320	So because of that responsibility, which I never
1325320	1327320	asked for, I have to balance out
1327320	1329320	the self-deprecation with a lot
1329320	1331320	of positive messaging about my people.
1331320	1333320	And that way, the dark jokes
1333320	1335320	function as a spoonful of
1335320	1337320	sugar to help the feminine
1337320	1339320	penis go down. But even without
1339320	1341320	the group representation issue,
1341320	1343320	it definitely is possible to take
1343320	1345320	self-deprecation too far.
1345320	1347320	As I've said, I have been diagnosed
1347320	1349320	with an incurable edginess of
1349320	1351320	temperament, and I sometimes do feel
1351320	1353320	suffocated by the safe space rules
1353320	1355320	of a lot of trans spaces, even though
1355320	1357320	those spaces are there for good reason
1357320	1359320	and a lot of people need them. But sometimes
1359320	1361320	this atmosphere of everything and everyone
1361320	1363320	is valid all the time, no
1363320	1365320	uncomfortable questions may be asked,
1365320	1367320	any self-deprecation is a sign
1367320	1369320	of traumatic internalized bigotry,
1369320	1371320	I just need to get out of there for a
1371320	1373320	while and find a place where I can relax
1373320	1375320	and be my edgy self.
1375320	1377320	I need a safe space for my edginess,
1377320	1379320	where I can just blurt out whatever
1379320	1381320	stupid question or joke comes to mind
1381320	1383320	without being afraid that I'm gonna
1383320	1385320	inflict horrible trauma on everyone around me.
1385320	1387320	So I call up another
1387320	1389320	transsexual edgelady, you know,
1389320	1391320	kiki, accuse each other of being cross-dressers,
1391320	1393320	and just laugh it all off.
1393320	1395320	And it's so so cathartic to
1395320	1397320	do that, but it does have
1397320	1399320	to be done in moderation, cause
1399320	1401320	there can come a point where you're picking at
1401320	1403320	the wound instead of numbing it.
1403320	1405320	And it mostly has to be done in private,
1405320	1407320	because in public, you have to worry
1407320	1409320	about how cis people will interpret
1409320	1411320	it, and so you have to find a way to
1411320	1413320	be self-deprecating without a
1413320	1415320	social responsibility.
1415320	1417320	Ugh, if there was ever a phrase that
1417320	1419320	instantly deadens all laughter, it's
1419320	1421320	social responsibility. But since
1421320	1423320	it's kind of the central topic of the comedy
1423320	1425320	culture war, I should probably say
1425320	1427320	something about it, even though, believe
1427320	1429320	me, I'd much rather go back to
1429320	1431320	jabbering about my sex change.
1433320	1435320	So what is a comedian's
1435320	1437320	job? What is a comedian supposed to
1437320	1439320	do? I suppose my ideal comedian
1439320	1441320	is one who is perfectly able to
1441320	1443320	balance the tension between shit
1443320	1445320	posting and snowflakery.
1445320	1447320	And this is an eternal tension,
1447320	1449320	and must never be resolved.
1449320	1451320	It is a tightrope I have devoted my
1451320	1453320	life to walking. See, if the tension
1453320	1455320	collapses into pure snowflakery,
1455320	1457320	you get a moralist who might
1457320	1459320	say that a comedian's purpose is to
1459320	1461320	promote justice by punching up,
1461320	1463320	by speaking truth to power, by
1463320	1465320	exposing the flaws of bigoted mindsets,
1465320	1467320	and so on. And these are all very admirable
1467320	1469320	goals, but they leave out what I
1469320	1471320	think is the essential purpose of comedy,
1471320	1473320	which is to be funny.
1473320	1475320	To surprise, to shock, to make
1475320	1477320	people laugh. It's kind of like how some
1477320	1479320	art and media critics only ever evaluate
1479320	1481320	a work based on whether or not it's socially
1481320	1483320	progressive, and don't seem to really
1483320	1485320	think about aesthetic pleasure very
1485320	1487320	much, which, to me, is the
1487320	1489320	reason why art exists in the first place.
1489320	1491320	But then again, I am a hedonistic
1491320	1493320	bourgeois decadent, and should probably
1493320	1495320	be sent to the guillotine at once.
1495320	1497320	Just let me do my makeup first, so that when they hold my head
1497320	1499320	up, everyone can see my beat, and their wings all
1499320	1501320	fly to the Bastille. Also, someone please post
1501320	1503320	the video to my Instagram, cause that's
1503320	1505320	gonna get a lot of engagement.
1505320	1507320	So the opposite of the pure snowflake
1507320	1509320	is the pure shit poster,
1509320	1511320	who might say that a comedian's purpose is to make
1511320	1513320	an audience laugh by any means necessary.
1513320	1515320	But that seems kinda barbaric,
1515320	1517320	since, like, if a guard at a prison
1517320	1519320	camp is torturing an inmate, and the other
1519320	1521320	guards are laughing, does that count
1521320	1523320	as comedy? Is a war crime funny?
1523320	1525320	Well, according to the Geneva Convention,
1525320	1527320	it's hilarious.
1527320	1529320	The thing is, I don't think many comedians
1529320	1531320	actually believe in a completely
1531320	1533320	nihilistic vision of comedy.
1533320	1535320	I think they sometimes pretend to,
1535320	1537320	when they're trying to evade criticism.
1537320	1539320	I mean, take even the edgiest of white guy comics,
1539320	1541320	and listen to the way they talk about their
1541320	1543320	heroes, Lenny Bruce or George Carlin.
1543320	1545320	There's always an element of admiration
1545320	1547320	for bravery, risk,
1547320	1549320	subversion, truth-telling. In other words,
1549320	1551320	there's a concern there for what is virtuous
1551320	1553320	and what is true, not just
1553320	1555320	for what makes people laugh. So maybe,
1555320	1557320	before we can even talk about what's funny,
1557320	1559320	we have to have a level of shared agreement
1559320	1561320	about what is true and what is morally right.
1561320	1563320	My objection to Ricky Gervais'
1563320	1565320	trans jokes is not just that they're not
1565320	1567320	funny. I think he's wrong about
1567320	1569320	trans people, and I think his ignorance
1569320	1571320	is infectious. I think he's
1571320	1573320	stirring up bigoted sentiments in his
1573320	1575320	audience, which has the consequence
1575320	1577320	of making the world slightly scarier
1577320	1579320	for people like me. And this is
1579320	1581320	edginess at its worst. Just a
1581320	1583320	privileged person with a platform
1583320	1585320	punching down at a politically besieged group
1585320	1587320	he understands nothing about. And that's
1587320	1589320	what happens when the snowflake shitpost tension
1589320	1591320	collapses into pure shitposting.
1591320	1593320	It's boring.
1593320	1595320	And immature. Like when someone says
1595320	1597320	he wants to watch the world burn.
1597320	1599320	You only get to watch when you have the privilege
1599320	1601320	of not being on fire.
1601320	1603320	It's edgy, but it's not the darkness.
1603320	1605320	The darkness is finding
1605320	1607320	a way to laugh about being
1607320	1609320	on fire. Edginess is always
1609320	1611320	adolescent. The darkness
1611320	1613320	is edginess aged by
1613320	1615320	time and pain. And it's only
1615320	1617320	at that full maturity that comedy
1617320	1619320	becomes art. That it becomes
1619320	1621320	comparable to music.
1621320	1623320	So, those are my thoughts.
1623320	1625320	Like, comment, and
1625320	1627320	subscribe.
1627320	1629320	The end.
1631320	1633320	Fine, I'll sing the song.
1637320	1639320	I wish my brother George was here.
1643320	1645320	Hello darkness
1645320	1647320	my old friend.
1649320	1651320	I've come to talk with you
1651320	1653320	again.
1653320	1655320	Because a vision
1655320	1657320	softly creeping
1659320	1661320	left its seeds while I was
1661320	1663320	sleeping.
1663320	1665320	And the vision
1665320	1667320	that was
1667320	1669320	planted in my
1669320	1671320	brain
1671320	1673320	still remains
1673320	1675320	within the sound
1675320	1677320	of silence.
1679320	1681320	In restless dreams
1681320	1683320	I walked alone.
1683320	1687320	Narrow streets of
1687320	1689320	cobblestone.
1689320	1691320	Neath the
1691320	1693320	halo of a
1693320	1695320	street lamp.
1695320	1697320	I turned my collar
1697320	1699320	to the cold and damp.
1699320	1701320	When my
1701320	1703320	eyes were stopped
1703320	1705320	by the flash of a
1705320	1707320	neon light.
1707320	1709320	That split the night
1709320	1711320	and touched
1711320	1713320	the sound.
1713320	1715320	Of silence.
1715320	1717320	And in the
1717320	1719320	naked light I
1719320	1721320	saw
1721320	1723320	ten thousand people
1723320	1725320	maybe more.
1727320	1729320	People talking without
1729320	1731320	speaking.
1731320	1733320	People hearing
1733320	1735320	without listening.
1735320	1737320	People
1737320	1739320	writing songs
1739320	1741320	that
1741320	1743320	voices never
1743320	1745320	share.
1745320	1747320	No one dared
1747320	1749320	disturb the sound
1749320	1751320	of
1751320	1753320	silence.
1755320	1757320	Stay
1757320	1759320	gorgeous.
