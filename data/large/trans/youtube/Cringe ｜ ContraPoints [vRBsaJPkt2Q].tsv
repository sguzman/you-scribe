0	4880	Hello again, the gays.
4880	6960	Welcome to my garden party fantasy.
6960	11240	Straight people, you're of course welcome to tag along too, provided you're emotionally
11240	12240	damaged!
12240	13240	Hi!
13240	14240	Hey, how are you?
14240	15240	Cringe!
15240	16560	Let's talk about it!
16560	21200	The word cringe has taken over my vocabulary lately, it just pops into my head all the
21200	22200	time.
22200	26400	Like, when I randomly remember that month back in 2013, when all of my Facebook posts
26400	31280	were just lyrics to Kesha songs rewritten in iambic pentameter, why?
31280	32940	What audience was that for?
32940	35900	Who is this inconceivable person I used to be?
35900	36900	Cringe!
36900	37900	Mega cringe!
37900	41740	I think I say this word like 50 times a day, cringe, cringe, cringe.
41740	42740	And I'm not the only one.
42740	46520	Google Trends shows that in the US, search interest in the word cringe has dramatically
46520	51260	increased over the last decade, peaking in 2016 and remaining pretty constant ever since.
51260	55280	And if you look at worldwide trends, search interest in cringe has hit an all-time high
55280	56360	the month I'm making this video.
56360	59120	So what is cringe?
59120	61600	Well, let's start with some examples.
61600	66100	There was a recent thread on Ask Reddit titled, What Things Really Make You Cringe?
66100	68240	And here are some of the most upvoted responses.
68240	71720	The time I was talking too loud at a wedding when I wasn't supposed to, and everyone
71720	74800	at the wedding turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.
74800	76320	Recordings of my own voice.
76320	80440	When I remember that I did the, I do have a boyfriend, he just goes to another school
80440	81440	thing.
81440	82580	Early teen me.
82580	83960	So many cringe stuff I did.
83960	86240	I hope all my old friends have forgotten about me.
86240	87740	This happened about two years ago.
87740	92060	I ordered some Pizza Hut online, and when it was delivered, the lady handed me the pizza
92060	93060	boxes.
93060	95900	I said thanks, and she told me my shirt was inside out.
95900	96900	I said, oh.
96900	100820	And then she hands me the receipt to sign and leave a tip, and I spend 30 seconds trying
100820	102160	to get the pen to work.
102160	105240	She looks at the pen and says, you have to click the pen.
105240	106240	I said, oh.
106240	109560	And then she reaches to get the receipt and tells me the pizza smells good.
109560	111360	Then I said, you too.
111360	113120	And then I closed the door and killed myself.
113120	114280	All of these responses illustrate exactly what writer Melissa Dahl said.
114280	115280	She said, oh.
115280	116320	Yeah, this is what I'm seeing.
116320	117320	But even though I had a better opinion on myself, I'm still disappointed in myself.
117320	118320	I'm not gonna be that person.
118320	119320	I'm not really that person.
119320	120320	So if she's gonna know who I am, I'm going to have to have to go live.
120320	121320	I don't want to.
121320	122320	She wrote from her book, Cringeworthy, A Theory of Awkwardness.
122320	123240	According to Dahl,
123240	124780	The moments that make us cringe are when we're yanked out of our own perspective, and we
124780	127880	can suddenly see ourselves from somebody else's point of view.
127880	132940	She quotes the anthropologist Edmund Carpenter, who in the 60s did a study of the Biyami tribe
132940	136980	in New Guinea, where he showed them mirror, video and photographic images of themselves
136980	139520	for the first time and described the results.
139520	144100	They were paralyzed after their first startled response, covering their mouths and ducking
144100	148740	heads. They stood transfixed, staring at their images, only their stomach muscles betraying
148740	149740	great tension."
149740	154780	So basically, they cringed at themselves. Maybe self-awareness always begins with cringing.
154780	158300	Like pretty much everyone seems to hate the sound of their voice when they hear a recording
158300	161860	for the first time. I guess because it sounds different from the way you hear it resonating
161860	166380	in your head. So when you hear the recording, you realize, oh god, that's how other people
166380	170660	hear me all the time. And you're suddenly aware of this clash between the way you appear
170660	175020	to yourself, and the way you appear to other people. That's when you cringe, the feeling
175020	180580	Dahl describes as the intense visceral reaction produced by an awkward moment, an unpleasant
180580	185460	kind of self-recognition where you suddenly see yourself through someone else's eyes.
185460	190160	It's a forced moment of self-awareness, and it usually makes you cognizant of the disappointing
190160	193700	fact that you aren't measuring up to your own self-concept.
193700	196980	When you're talking too loud at a wedding, and suddenly everyone turns around to see
196980	200620	what asshole wouldn't shut up, you suddenly realize how you look to them.
200620	205140	Because we've all at some point turned around to see what asshole wouldn't shut up.
205140	208620	But this time, you're the asshole. Cringe.
208620	213400	Often it's the violation of an implicit social norm that makes us cringe. There's no law
213400	218120	of state, or even of etiquette, that tells you exactly how loud you're supposed to speak
218120	222680	at a wedding. It's something you have to intuit based on context. How loud are other people
222680	227100	speaking? Is the ceremony about to begin and we're all supposed to be quiet now?
227100	230560	According to YouTuber Vsauce Michael here, the function of awkwardness
230560	236980	is that it sands social dynamics by smoothing out what even etiquette doesn't rule on.
236980	242500	Cringe is the electric shock, the emotional punishment, for being awkward. It enforces
242500	246860	the limits of socially acceptable behavior by wounding the ego.
246860	251360	And memories of your cringey moments are often just as painful as the moments themselves.
251360	255180	Ten years later, you'll be trying to fall asleep, and for no reason at all, your brain
255180	259180	will decide to remind you of that time you were talking too loud at the wedding, and
259180	260540	of the stupid thing you were doing.
260540	264200	You were saying when everyone turned around to stare at you, and you'll cringe all over
264200	268220	again. That's why remembering your teenage years is so painful. Because you look back
268220	274880	and you realize, damn, I was the asshole for like, seven consecutive years. Can I just
274880	280080	hire a hitman to kill everyone who remembers me before, I don't know, November?
280080	284420	Now all the examples we've considered so far involve self-cringe, but usually when
284420	289100	we talk about cringe on the internet, we're talking about cringing at other people. Popular
289100	290100	subreddits like r slash cringe are often just a way to show that you're not cringing at
290100	290300	other people.
290540	296280	Cringe, cringepix, and cringetopia host videos and images of people behaving in cringey ways.
296280	300740	For instance, a maternity photo that looks like a hostage crisis, grim moments of lamentation
300740	304720	and cuckoldry, and Mitt Romney attempting to communicate during his first encounter
304720	305740	with black people.
305740	308820	Who let the dogs out? Who? Who?
308820	313920	Ugh. Watching that makes me feel like my soul is on fire. It makes me want to crawl out
313920	319040	of my body and escape into another dimension. I think some people feel cringe more intensely
319040	320040	than others.
320040	324420	For me, it's uncomfortable to the point where I will reflexively pause a video like
324420	328260	that because I just can't stand it. In other words, it's like watching my own YouTube
328260	332340	videos, whichâ€¦ Sweaty, if you put that shit on, I will leave the room.
332340	337120	So why is it that cringing at other people hurts in the same way as cringing at yourself?
337120	341960	Well, one theory is that cringing at other people is simply vicarious embarrassment,
341960	345860	or secondhand embarrassment. Basically, it's a form of empathy.
345860	349380	When you cringe at someone, you're feeling the embarrassment that they're feeling,
349380	352420	just as if if you watch someone fall down the stairs,
352420	355140	you might wince empathetically with their pain.
355140	355960	But there's a problem
355960	358380	with the vicarious embarrassment theory of cringe,
358380	359840	or at least a complication,
359840	362260	which is that in the purest examples of cringe,
362260	366120	the person doing the cringey thing isn't feeling embarrassed.
366120	368220	In fact, often they're super confident,
368220	370520	and it's actually their lack of self-awareness
370520	373600	about their embarrassing behavior that makes you cringe.
373600	374620	Like when a woman posts
374620	377300	a ridiculously over-face-tuned picture of herself
377300	379780	as if anyone's gonna believe she looks like that,
379780	382500	or when a man thinks he looks like a badass tough guy
382500	385360	when he actually looks like an embarrassing dingus.
385360	387060	So in the internet sense of the word,
387060	390020	cringe is not just vicarious embarrassment.
390020	392860	Someone tripping and falling on stage is embarrassing,
392860	394900	and I do feel embarrassed for her,
394900	398320	but she knows it's embarrassing and she feels embarrassed.
398320	399480	You guys are just standing up
399480	400880	because you feel bad that I fell,
400880	402920	and that's really embarrassing, but thank you.
402920	405020	Nothing about this is cringe.
405020	407140	Maybe to her, it's self-cringe.
407140	409780	Maybe she looks back on it and it's still embarrassing,
409780	412040	but I don't cringe at her.
412040	414940	Maybe there's a difference between cringing at someone
414940	416420	and cringing with them.
416420	419460	When someone falls on stage, I cringe with her
419460	422100	in the sense that I feel vicarious embarrassment.
422100	424520	My feelings mirror what she's feeling.
424520	426800	But when I'm cringing at someone,
426800	428380	I'm feeling something very different
428380	429320	to what they're feeling.
429320	432080	I'm cringing at Captain Badass over here
432080	436020	because he doesn't have the decency to cringe at himself.
436020	436980	Another example is
436980	438900	bad American Idol auditions,
438900	441140	which are quintessential cringe content.
441140	443380	People try out for American Idol
443380	445640	because they think they're good enough singers
445640	447660	to compete in a national competition.
447660	450240	So they're effectively revealing their own delusions
450240	452360	when they show up and sing like this.
452360	455600	Is this the real life?
455600	458880	Or is this just fantasy?
458880	461660	It's not just that he's terrible that makes it cringe.
461660	463540	Most of us are bad singers, right?
463540	465720	When people sing happy birthday at a party,
465720	466560	usually they're singing
466980	468940	different keys at no particular tempo.
468940	470000	But that's not cringe,
470000	472100	because the point of singing happy birthday
472100	473480	is not to sound amazing.
473480	475660	Bad American Idol auditions are cringe
475660	478820	because of the contestant's misplaced confidence.
478820	481700	Who are you as good as, in your opinion?
481700	483580	The lead singer from Queen.
483580	487320	It's the hubris of thinking you sound like Freddie Mercury
487320	490020	when in fact you sound like a wounded street dog.
490020	495400	I admit that watching Red,
495400	496860	I'm actually not in very much pain
496860	497960	when I'm cringing at him.
497960	500140	I laugh at his ludicrous performance,
500140	501480	just like the judges do.
501480	503500	And because he's so cocky,
503500	506680	and because he doesn't show signs of embarrassment himself,
506680	510220	there's a part of me that actually kind of enjoys his failure.
510220	512040	There's almost a sense of karma,
512040	514260	a sense that because of his tragic hubris,
514260	517820	he deserves the humiliation he's bringing upon himself.
517820	519600	And my sense that he deserves it
519600	522140	suppresses my compassionate response
522140	525060	and helps remove any guilt I might otherwise have
525060	526820	about taking pleasure in someone's humiliation.
526860	530540	Contrast this with another Idol cringe contestant,
530540	532460	Misha, who's there with her mom,
532460	534960	and they both seem like such sweethearts.
534960	536700	I do believe in her talent.
536700	537960	That's very much.
537960	540640	And yeah, she's delusional about her singing talent,
540640	542460	but I'm rooting for her.
542460	546240	And when she embarrasses herself, I feel no joy,
546240	548880	only deep and agonizing cringe.
548880	553700	Don't you wish your girlfriend was hot like me?
553700	554540	Yikes.
554540	555960	My differing reactions to Red and Misha,
555960	559240	track a distinction that Dahl makes
559240	562760	between compassionate cringe and contemptuous cringe.
562760	566320	Compassionate cringe involves an emotional identification
566320	568100	with the person you're cringing at.
568100	570020	Even if they aren't embarrassed themselves
570020	571540	in the cringe-worthy moment,
571540	574380	you still feel the embarrassment they would feel
574380	577320	or perhaps ought to feel if they were aware
577320	579380	of how other people were perceiving them.
579380	581560	Contemptuous cringe, on the other hand,
581560	583840	involves an emotional distancing
583840	585460	from the person you're cringing at.
585460	587260	Just like with compassionate cringe,
587260	590360	you perceive that the person is embarrassing themselves,
590360	593240	but instead of feeling embarrassment on their behalf,
593240	596360	you feel annoyance and disgust at them,
596360	598360	and maybe even a little schadenfreude.
598360	601840	So these are actually two very different emotional responses,
601840	604400	vicarious embarrassment versus contempt.
604400	606260	We call both feelings cringe,
606260	608200	not because they're similar feelings,
608200	611760	but because they're responses to the same type of situation.
611760	613360	People lacking self-awareness
613360	615460	embarrassing themselves without realizing it.
615460	618860	Now, embarrassment and contempt seem, at face value,
618860	620960	like pretty unpleasant feelings.
620960	623360	So why are we so fascinated by content
623360	624860	that makes us feel this way?
624860	628360	Why do these cringe subreddits have more than a million members?
628360	631260	Why are cringe compilations and cringe reaction videos
631260	633060	so popular on YouTube?
633060	636260	Why does so much comedy feature cringey situations?
636260	638560	Well, I think the answer to that question depends
638560	641760	on whether we're cringing compassionately or contemptuously.
641760	643460	When I read that Ask Reddit thread
643460	645360	where all the people share their cringe stories,
645460	647160	I cringe compassionately.
647160	650360	That is, I feel vicarious embarrassment for them.
650360	653460	And with that compassion comes a sense of solidarity
653460	655060	and camaraderie with them.
655060	656860	I recognize myself in them,
656860	659460	and I'm reassured to hear that other people
659460	662060	are just as awkward and embarrassing as I am.
662060	664460	I'm not the only one who cringes at my past
664460	665960	or at videos of myself.
665960	667660	I'm not the only one who sometimes says,
667660	670460	you too, when the person says the pizza smells good.
670460	672860	When we collectively laugh at these situations,
672860	675360	we're bonding over our shared human frailty.
675460	678560	We're recognizing that we all say the wrong things sometimes.
678560	681560	That we've all arrogantly argued for an opinion,
681560	683360	only to later educate ourselves
683360	686560	and realize how ignorant and wrong we were.
686560	689760	That we've all tried to present ourselves as cool and likable,
689760	692960	as beautiful and talented and badass,
692960	694360	only to totally miss the mark
694360	696160	and completely embarrass ourselves.
696160	698560	And laughing at our shared absurdity,
698560	701860	our insecurity, our ridiculous pretenses,
701860	703560	it makes us feel less alone.
703560	705260	Now, this is all, of course, assuming
705260	707260	that we're cringing compassionately.
707260	711660	But I would argue that most cringe content on the internet
711660	713560	does not encourage compassion.
713560	715560	And that's kind of an uncomfortable fact,
715560	719260	because we like to think of ourselves as morally evolved.
719260	721260	This is the 21st century, right?
721260	724760	Pilleries and freak shows and public floggings,
724760	728060	these are barbaric practices from the dark ages, right?
728060	731160	Surely no one on the internet would ever entertain themselves
731160	734160	by humiliating people, right?
735260	738260	We've got maniacs.
738260	739760	We've got wackadoos.
739760	742760	We've got schizos, fatties, and spergs.
742760	746260	Come see sexual deviants on display.
746260	747260	That's right, folks.
747260	750760	We've got cackling perverts of every denomination.
750760	752260	Come see the panty sniffer.
752260	755760	He'll stop at nothing to indulge his twisted cravings.
755760	757260	Come see the skeleton girl.
757260	759260	She hasn't had a bite in 30 days.
759260	763260	That's right, we've got real, live lesbians.
763260	765260	And I'll be your master of ceremonies.
765260	769260	Half man, half woman, all freak.
770260	773760	Okay, we've heard enough heartwarming gibberish.
773760	775760	Welcome to the dark side of cringe.
775760	779260	Here on YouTube.com, we have a cringe culture.
779260	782260	And by that I mean there's whole channels making content
782260	784760	that centers the experience of cringing.
784760	787760	And there's a huge audience that seeks out cringe content,
787760	791760	including content the creator didn't intend to be cringe.
791760	794760	I first started paying attention to this back in 2016,
794760	797760	which was the heyday of the feminist cringe compilation,
797760	800260	or SJW cringe compilation.
800260	801260	Remember those?
801260	803760	This is ancient history by YouTube standards,
803760	806760	but in 2016, the word cringe was most associated
806760	809260	with a YouTuber called LeafyIsHere.
809260	812260	His videos followed the format of a cringe reaction video,
812260	814760	which means he would play someone else's content,
814760	818760	then pause it to rant in voiceover about how cringe it is.
818760	820260	No makeup or some sweatpants.
820260	821760	Oh my god.
821760	823760	It's so fucking bad.
823760	825260	He looks like he's gender fluid.
825260	827260	He looks like a fucking lesbian.
827260	831260	This format of cringe reaction videos was very influential,
831260	835260	and it was picked up by a rational herd of skeptical beasts
835260	836760	and free-thinking tuxedos.
836760	838260	What even is this thing?
838260	840260	It must be one of the 76 genders.
840260	843260	I didn't realize retarded was a gender.
843260	844260	Sorry, my dudes.
844260	846260	You were on the cringe side of history.
846260	849760	Obviously, there was a political angle to SJW cringe videos.
849760	852760	The logical antelope isn't inviting you to foster
852760	856260	a shared sense of humanity by recognizing your own weakness
856260	858260	in the embarrassment of screeching feminists.
858260	861260	No, this is an invitation to contempt.
861260	865260	Here's a YouTube video titled Fat Acceptance Cringe Compilation.
865260	867260	You'd expect from the title that it would be a video
867260	870760	of fat acceptance activists behaving in cringey ways.
870760	871760	But it isn't.
871760	874760	It's literally just a compilation of fat people doing things.
874760	877260	This is just a clip of a fat woman swimming.
877260	878760	Is this cringe?
878760	880260	What is cringe about it?
880260	882260	Earlier we defined cringe as either
882260	884760	vicarious embarrassment or contempt
884760	887760	for someone who lacks awareness about the way others are perceiving them.
887760	891260	But in this video of a swimming fat woman, there's no context,
891260	893760	so we don't know anything about her mental state.
893760	897760	And we certainly don't know whether she's self-aware about how she's being perceived.
897760	900760	If there is an interview where she talks about how she looks like a supermodel
900760	904260	or if she tried to photoshop herself to look like a size 4,
904260	906260	okay, maybe that would be cringe.
906260	908260	But that's not what's going on in this clip.
908260	910260	She's just existing.
910260	911260	In water.
911260	914260	What cringe are we being invited to feel over this?
914260	916760	Presumably, something along the lines of
916760	917760	ew.
917760	918760	Fat people.
918760	919760	Gross.
919760	921760	It's literally just disgust, right?
921760	925760	Disgust and contempt for a type of person, a type of body.
925760	927260	Here's another cringe compilation,
927260	928260	this one titled
930260	935760	and we're watching a young teenager discuss their plans to start vlogging about their genderfluid identity.
935760	939260	Honestly, it's kind of terrifying because,
939260	940760	you know, like,
941260	943760	genderfluid people just aren't accepted.
943760	945260	Yeah, apparently not.
945260	949260	And judging from the fact that I'm currently watching this in a cringe compilation,
949260	953760	it seems that the person in this video was dead on about how people would perceive them.
953760	955760	But despite that self-awareness,
955760	957760	we're being invited to cringe.
957760	959260	Because...
959260	962260	I guess being genderfluid, like being fat,
962260	964760	is cringe in and of itself.
964760	968260	Now the pedant in me wants to oppose this use of cringe.
968260	970760	This is not real cringe, I wanna say.
970760	975260	Cringe has to involve a clash between self-perception and perception by others.
975260	980260	But this usage of cringe as a mere synonym for contempt is so widespread
980260	982760	that there's really no point in objecting to it.
982760	985260	If you look at the banner image of Cringetopia,
985260	987260	one of the sleazier cringe subreddits,
987260	990260	you can pick out an otaku with a waifu body pillow,
990260	991260	a furry,
991260	992760	a couple bronies,
992760	994260	a fedora tipper.
994260	998760	These are subcultures associated with nerdy social outcasts.
998760	1000760	They're types of people who are white,
1000760	1002260	widely ridiculed online.
1002260	1005260	I'd like to share with you a list that I put together
1005260	1008260	of groups that are often considered to be cringe.
1008260	1008760	Bronies,
1008760	1009760	furries,
1009760	1010260	otaku,
1010260	1011260	weebs,
1011260	1011760	incels,
1011760	1012760	neckbeards,
1012760	1013760	fedora tippers,
1013760	1014760	gamers,
1014760	1015760	TikTok teens,
1015760	1017260	not-like-other-girls girls,
1017260	1018260	fanfic writers,
1018260	1019260	beat poets,
1019260	1020260	SJWs,
1020260	1020760	feminists,
1020760	1021760	magas,
1021760	1022760	trans people,
1022760	1023760	non-binary people,
1023760	1024760	trans trenders,
1024760	1026760	queer afab ukulele players,
1026760	1027760	autistic people,
1027760	1028760	fat people,
1028760	1029760	the mentally ill,
1029760	1030760	and the mentally disabled.
1030760	1034260	Now I'm searching for some thread that all these groups have in common,
1034260	1036760	and a handful of themes do jump out.
1036760	1037760	Deviancy,
1037760	1040260	whether physical, mental, social, or sexual.
1040260	1043760	A combination of passionate sincerity and amateurism.
1043760	1046760	The perceived tendency to lack emotional composure.
1046760	1049760	Obsessive interests and unconventional hobbies.
1049760	1051260	Low social status.
1051260	1054260	It's pretty easy to wind up in the cringe category these days.
1054260	1056260	If you add up all the groups on this list,
1056260	1059260	I bet it includes most of the people watching this video.
1059260	1060760	It includes me three or four times.
1060760	1065760	I'm of course a fedora-tipping, queer, afab, ukulele-playing TikTok team.
1065760	1067760	Can't we just accept that we're all a bit cringe,
1067760	1071760	and try to be, like, compassionate or whatever?
1071760	1073260	Fuck no.
1073260	1076760	The internet will not abide any of that kumbaya bullshit.
1076760	1077260	Oh no.
1077260	1080260	This is social reject battle royale.
1080260	1084260	Clearly, contemptuous cringing is rewarding to people in some way,
1084260	1087760	and I want to explore what the rewards might be.
1087760	1090760	Let's start by looking at the role of cringe in internet politics.
1090760	1094760	Where manufacturing contempt is a powerful strategy.
1094760	1097760	At the height of YouTube anti-feminism, 2016 or so,
1097760	1101760	you couldn't escape clips of this woman, known as Big Red,
1101760	1104760	a Toronto resident who showed up at a men's rights event
1104760	1108260	and read off a list of feminist theses while swearing profusely.
1108260	1110260	It's part of patriarchy.
1110260	1111760	Part of patriarchy.
1111760	1113260	I don't know if you're noticing a theme.
1113260	1114260	Patriarchy.
1114260	1115260	I'm reading.
1115260	1116260	Fuckface.
1116260	1117260	Mr. Entitled.
1117260	1118260	Mr. Ego.
1118260	1119260	Patriarchy, fuckface.
1119260	1120760	She's one of these people who just
1120760	1122760	generates memeable phrases at an amazing rate.
1122760	1124760	I actually think she's hilarious and iconic,
1124760	1127760	but I have unconventional tastes, Anastasia.
1127760	1130760	Anyway, this video appeared in countless cringe compilations,
1130760	1134760	reaction videos, remixes, and even anti-feminist video essays.
1134760	1136760	Often Big Red was framed as, like,
1136760	1139760	THE feminist, the mascot of feminism,
1139760	1142760	a sort of metonymic stand-in for all feminists.
1142760	1147760	Which is highly dishonest, considering she's not even a high-profile activist or thinker.
1147760	1150760	She was literally some random woman on the streets of Toronto.
1150760	1152760	But because of this amusing 12-minute video,
1152760	1156760	it was insisted upon that we all take a stand on this random woman,
1156760	1161760	who, we were told, exemplified feminism in its purest form.
1161760	1164760	I call this strategy mascotization,
1164760	1166760	the construction of a strawman nemesis.
1166760	1169760	What you do is you select a cringe-worthy person
1169760	1173760	and you appoint them the mascot of an opposing political team.
1173760	1175760	It's very simple, but very effective.
1175760	1178760	And it's best paired with memification.
1178760	1180760	That's when you take a single moment in a person's life,
1180760	1181760	you freeze it,
1181760	1185760	and you declare that that moment fully represents a person.
1185760	1187760	Then, through mascotization,
1187760	1192760	you declare that this memified person represents an entire group or movement.
1192760	1195760	Other right-wing memes from this era include this protester,
1195760	1197760	You're fucking a white male!
1197760	1199760	memified as AIDS Skrillex,
1199760	1200760	and this protester,
1200760	1205760	Keep your hands clean! I'm a scoundrel! Keep your hands clean! I'm a scoundrel!
1205760	1207760	who was memified as Trigley Puff.
1207760	1209760	The two of them symbolized the wretchedness
1209760	1211760	of beta new male cuckoldry
1211760	1215760	and the hysteria of social justice cry bullies, respectively.
1215760	1218760	I guess the ultimate memified mascot was Anita Sarkeesian,
1218760	1222760	about whom hundreds of hours of salty gamer ramblings have been uploaded.
1222760	1225760	Sometimes Anita was caricatured as cringe,
1225760	1227760	as like this fake gamer girl,
1227760	1229760	this pleb-tier casual,
1229760	1231760	throwing a pathetic tantrum at real gamers.
1231760	1234760	But other times it was almost a super villainous caricature,
1234760	1238760	this sort of dark, devouring mother archetype,
1238760	1240760	threatening to confiscate your video games
1240760	1242760	and engulf you in her yonic abyss.
1242760	1247760	Now it's obvious why caricaturing your political enemies as super villainous is effective.
1247760	1249760	Though it comes at the risk of backfiring
1249760	1252760	by making your opponent seem a little bit too powerful,
1252760	1254760	a little too badass.
1254760	1258760	But the subtler strategy of symbolizing your political enemies
1258760	1261760	not with an evil, but with a cringe-worthy mascot,
1261760	1266760	works because it connects with a wide audience in an intense, emotional way.
1266760	1271760	Most people have a primal terror of becoming the target of public ridicule.
1271760	1273760	And if someone has been made a laughingstock,
1273760	1277760	it's much safer to take the side of the people doing the laughing
1277760	1280760	than it is to risk being laughed at yourself.
1280760	1283760	To be cringe is not to be in on the joke.
1283760	1286760	And because people crave acceptance and dread rejection,
1286760	1290760	I think one reason we're so fascinated by cringe content
1290760	1295760	is that our brains want us to learn how to avoid being laughed at.
1295760	1298760	When we see a mob of people, whether in person or online,
1298760	1300760	laughing at someone and ridiculing them,
1300760	1304760	we register an emotional memory of it as a warning.
1304760	1307760	Don't act like that, or people will laugh at you.
1307760	1311760	This is a powerful tool for anyone who wants to control human behavior.
1311760	1316760	It's why public humiliation has in many societies been a punishment for criminals.
1316760	1320760	You see a person in the stocks, in the pillory, at the whipping post.
1320760	1323760	You see the mob jeering and throwing rotten vegetables.
1323760	1325760	And it sends a powerful message.
1325760	1327760	Don't do whatever that guy did.
1327760	1330760	I don't think the internet has yet reached self-consciousness about the fact
1330760	1335760	that the fear of public humiliation rules us like it's the 17th century.
1335760	1338760	There's no judge sentencing people to a day in the stocks.
1338760	1342760	But instead, there's teenage YouTubers making cringe reaction videos.
1342760	1345760	There's ex-boyfriends revenge posting their girlfriends' nudes.
1345760	1349760	There's vigilante Twitter mobs harassing and shaming just about anyone
1349760	1351760	for alleged breaches of wokeness.
1351760	1353760	Public humiliation is a powerful force.
1353760	1355760	And it's usually...
1355760	1357760	It's not a good force.
1357760	1359760	But there are some rare exceptions.
1359760	1361760	Back in the Gamergate era,
1361760	1364760	Gamergate itself, of course, being a study in public humiliation,
1364760	1366760	slut-shaming on a massive online scale,
1366760	1370760	YouTube commentary was increasingly dominated by anti-feminism.
1370760	1373760	As far as leftist content, there was the Young Turks,
1373760	1376760	and there was a network of besieged feminist vloggers
1376760	1378760	who were constantly mobbed and harassed.
1378760	1380760	What I see is one of the turning points
1380760	1384760	in shifting the atmosphere from the pro-Gamergate days
1384760	1387760	to the left-tube world of today
1387760	1391760	was a handful of videos uploaded by then-obscure YouTuber Harry Brewis,
1391760	1394760	in which he mocked a misogynist pseudo-intellectual
1394760	1396760	called Davis Aurini.
1396760	1397760	Come on, Davis, we have to...
1397760	1399760	No, stop lecturing me about ethics!
1399760	1400760	We have to get out of here!
1400760	1403760	And can you please stop trying to start a forest fire?!
1403760	1405760	In his YouTube videos, Davis would pontificate
1405760	1407760	about the wickedness of women
1407760	1409760	while posing in front of a toy skull
1409760	1412760	and taking microscopic sips from a glass of whiskey.
1414760	1417760	Men of the West, women in our culture,
1417760	1421760	have become the most decadent sluts since the fall of Rome.
1421760	1424760	And so in discussing sluts versus whores,
1424760	1426760	I would start with the premise
1426760	1429760	that all women are whores.
1436760	1439760	Harry's videos ridiculing Davis attracted a lot of views
1439760	1441760	and a fairly positive response
1441760	1443760	even from a mostly male gamer audience,
1443760	1446760	who were overwhelmingly anti-feminist at the time.
1446760	1449760	Why did these videos work with this audience
1449760	1451760	where so many others didn't?
1451760	1452760	Well, I think it's because
1452760	1455760	Harry didn't moralistically call out Davis
1455760	1458760	for being problematic or misogynistic.
1458760	1461760	Instead, he simply drew attention to the fact
1461760	1464760	that Davis is a cringe-worthy buffoon.
1464760	1466760	And Davis was a perfect target
1466760	1469760	because he truly is cringe in the traditional sense.
1469760	1471760	He had no self-awareness about the fact
1471760	1472760	that pretty much everyone saw,
1472760	1474760	through his absurd posturing,
1474760	1476760	as a badass tough guy by day,
1476760	1478760	profoundly dark philosopher by night.
1478760	1481760	We exist in a world with feminized legislation.
1481760	1484760	I've spoken to men and boys who've told me
1484760	1486760	that Harry's videos inspired
1486760	1489760	the beginning of a feminist awakening in them.
1489760	1491760	Not just because they cringed at Davis Arrheni,
1491760	1494760	but also because they recognized
1494760	1496760	a little bit of Davis in themselves.
1496760	1498760	And they cringed at that too.
1498760	1500760	Recognizing part of yourself
1500760	1501760	in a cringe-worthy person
1501760	1503760	induces self-cringe,
1503760	1506760	which can motivate you to change your behavior,
1506760	1507760	your beliefs,
1507760	1509760	or even your own self-concept.
1509760	1512760	And it helps that Davis is a perfect instance
1512760	1515760	of a recognizable stock character on the internet,
1515760	1517760	namely the Fedora Tipper.
1517760	1520760	Basically a man who poses as a gallant crusader
1520760	1522760	for traditional masculinity,
1522760	1524760	but who's basically just a pasty nerd
1524760	1525760	who can't relate to women.
1525760	1527760	Davis was such an extreme version of this,
1527760	1530760	and he delivered unintentionally hilarious moments
1530760	1533760	so frequently that I would classify him
1533760	1536760	as what the internet calls a lull cow.
1536760	1538760	Lull cow is old 4chan lingo.
1538760	1541760	It means a person whose unintentionally eccentric
1541760	1544760	or foolish behavior can be milked for lulls.
1544760	1546760	Milking, in this context,
1546760	1548760	can mean simply watching a lull cow's behavior
1548760	1549760	and laughing at them,
1549760	1551760	or it can mean making reaction videos
1551760	1553760	where you make fun of them,
1553760	1556760	or it can mean actively trolling and provoking them
1556760	1559760	to get a response that you find entertaining.
1559760	1561760	I'd describe Harry's videos about Davis,
1561760	1563760	or my old videos about the Golden One,
1563760	1565760	as lull cow milking content,
1565760	1567760	with a political angle.
1567760	1569760	It was essentially an argument from ridicule,
1569760	1571760	an argument from cringe,
1571760	1573760	with the aim of convincing people
1573760	1576760	don't embarrass yourself like these ding-dongs.
1576760	1577760	But also,
1577760	1579760	and I'll just speak for myself here,
1579760	1581760	I am, at the end of the day,
1581760	1583760	an entertainer.
1583760	1585760	And I wanted people to laugh.
1585760	1587760	There doesn't need to be a political agenda
1587760	1588760	behind milking lull cows.
1588760	1590760	In fact, usually, there isn't.
1590760	1593760	The purest example of a lull cow I can think of
1593760	1595760	is actually someone from way before the internet,
1595760	1597760	namely Florence Foster Jenkins.
1597760	1599760	Jenkins, or Lady Florence,
1599760	1601760	as she liked to be called,
1601760	1603760	was an American soprano
1603760	1605760	who attracted a cult following in New York City
1605760	1607760	during the 1920s, 30s, and 40s
1607760	1609760	due to her being such a terrible singer
1609760	1611760	that people went to her concerts
1611760	1613760	essentially for the lulls.
1613760	1614760	She was described as
1614760	1616760	the world's worst opera singer.
1616760	1617760	No one,
1617760	1618760	before or since,
1618760	1620760	has succeeded in liberating themselves
1620760	1621760	quite so completely
1621760	1624760	from the shackles of musical notation.
1624760	1627760	Behold this fucking camp queen.
1627760	1629760	Oh, we have no choice but to stan.
1629760	1631760	Here's a short clip of one of the few recordings she made.
1637760	1638760	Cringe.
1638760	1640760	She was essentially the Tommy Wiseau,
1640760	1642760	the William Hung of her age.
1642760	1645760	Apparently she was oblivious to her own incompetence
1645760	1646760	until 1944,
1646760	1648760	when she was 76 years old,
1648760	1650760	and she booked Carnegie Hall for a concert
1650760	1653760	to which newspaper critics showed up.
1653760	1654760	The next morning,
1654760	1655760	the New York Sun reported,
1655760	1657760	much of her singing was hopelessly lacking
1657760	1659760	in a semblance of pitch,
1659760	1662760	but the further a note was from its proper elevation,
1662760	1665760	the more the audience laughed and applauded.
1665760	1666760	And five days later,
1666760	1668760	she had a heart attack and died.
1668760	1670760	I find something very touching about this story.
1670760	1672760	I mean, I'd probably be laughing as much as anyone
1672760	1674760	if I were at Carnegie Hall that night,
1674760	1675760	but I feel so much better.
1675760	1678760	I feel so much compassionate cringe for Lady Florence.
1678760	1681760	It kind of makes you appreciate the kind cruelty of Simon Cowell,
1681760	1683760	at least he tries to stop these people
1683760	1684760	before things get out of hand.
1684760	1687760	I think it's normal to have mixed feelings about a lolcow.
1687760	1689760	Like, yes, this is hilarious,
1689760	1691760	but on the other hand,
1691760	1693760	doth not a lolcow bleed?
1693760	1697760	On some level we know it's wrong to entertain ourselves this way,
1697760	1698760	but on the other hand,
1698760	1701760	other people's pain is incredibly entertaining.
1701760	1704760	There's a good book about this called The Joy of Pain,
1704760	1707760	Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature,
1707760	1708760	by Richard Smith.
1708760	1709760	Schadenfreude is, of course,
1709760	1711760	the pleasure we take in other people's misery,
1711760	1714760	and Smith argues that we experience it
1714760	1715760	because psychologically,
1715760	1718760	we gain something when other people lose.
1718760	1720760	We're constantly evaluating our own worth
1720760	1723760	by comparing ourselves to other people.
1723760	1725760	So we get a reassuring self-esteem boost,
1725760	1728760	a pleasant feeling of superiority,
1728760	1731760	from comparing ourselves to people beneath us,
1731760	1734760	especially if we're kind of insecure to begin with.
1734760	1736760	Maybe I'm not perfect,
1736760	1738760	but at least I'm not this lolcow.
1738760	1740760	And we also get a boost
1740760	1742760	when people who are socially above us,
1742760	1743760	whom we envy,
1743760	1745760	get brought down a peg.
1745760	1747760	James Charles' cancelled party,
1747760	1749760	LOLOL.
1749760	1752760	I think Schadenfreude basically accounts
1752760	1756760	for just a huge percentage of the things that happen on YouTube.com.
1756760	1758760	Smith uses the word
1758760	1760760	for this type of media,
1760760	1762760	like reality TV shows
1762760	1764760	designed to produce spectacular moments
1764760	1765760	of embarrassment.
1765760	1768760	YouTube is basically a big reality TV show,
1768760	1770760	or some kind of carnival sideshow.
1770760	1772760	I mean, take a look around you.
1772760	1774760	We have Eugenia Cooney,
1774760	1776760	a YouTuber who, at the time I'm making this video,
1776760	1778760	remains apparently in total denial
1778760	1779760	about her eating disorder,
1779760	1781760	and continues to make videos
1781760	1783760	modeling skimpy clothes for millions of gawkers.
1783760	1784760	We have Wings of Redemption,
1784760	1786760	a bad-tempered gamer who,
1786760	1787760	for a long time,
1787760	1789760	was essentially confined by poverty,
1789760	1790760	obesity, and depression
1790760	1792760	to streaming video games all day
1792760	1793760	to an audience of trolls
1793760	1795760	that enjoyed tormenting him.
1795760	1796760	We have Onision,
1796760	1797760	a habitual
1797760	1798760	ALLENGE
1798760	1800760	abuser of women and teenage girls,
1800760	1801760	who earlier this year
1801760	1804760	essentially performed his own mental breakdown
1804760	1805760	on YouTube
1805760	1806760	after Patreon banned him
1806760	1808760	for doxxing an accuser.
1808760	1811760	I love kombucha!
1814760	1815760	Whose idea was it
1815760	1817760	to give hundreds of pathological narcissists
1817760	1819760	access to video equipment?
1819760	1821760	What kind of sick social experiment
1821760	1822760	are we living in?
1822760	1823760	And the viewers
1823760	1825760	are no better than the performers.
1825760	1827760	Every one of you bloodthirsty voyeurs
1827760	1828760	makes me sick.
1828760	1830760	Oh, you people love nothing more
1830760	1832760	than to watch one of us poor,
1832760	1833760	helpless egomaniacs
1833760	1835760	completely lose our minds
1835760	1836760	live on camera.
1836760	1837760	Is this what you want, huh?
1837760	1838760	Is this what-
1838760	1842760	You wanna total meltdown?
1842760	1843760	You know, as a creator,
1843760	1845760	you have to be aware that
1845760	1847760	you're a circus performer,
1847760	1848760	and the crowd may in fact
1848760	1850760	be more entertained
1850760	1851760	if you fall from the trapeze
1851760	1853760	and get eaten by the tigers.
1853760	1854760	Online media today
1854760	1856760	is full of Lady Florences,
1856760	1858760	anti-celebrities with anti-fans.
1858760	1860760	Now, to be clear,
1860760	1862760	I don't think there's anything inherently wrong
1862760	1864760	with indulging now and then
1864760	1866760	in a little bit of light contempt.
1866760	1867760	Cringing at Davis Aurini
1867760	1869760	or bad American Idol auditions
1869760	1870760	seems pretty harmless,
1870760	1872760	but it can be taken too far.
1872760	1874760	And there's no better case study
1874760	1876760	of taking it too far
1876760	1877760	than the cult following
1877760	1880760	of one Christine Weston Chandler.
1880760	1882760	If you don't know what's coming,
1882760	1883760	you might want to strap in, Gorge,
1883760	1886760	because this is coconuts.
1886760	1887760	It's bananas.
1887760	1888760	It's a full fruit salad.
1888760	1891760	God, how do I even begin to explain this?
1891760	1894760	Well, Christine Weston Chandler,
1894760	1896760	more commonly known on the internet
1896760	1898760	as Chris-Chan,
1898760	1900760	is the victim
1900760	1902760	of what is quite possibly
1902760	1904760	the longest-running
1904760	1905760	and most obsessive
1905760	1908760	internet trolling saga of all time.
1908760	1910760	She's the lolcow of lols.
1910760	1911760	Hello, everybody.
1911760	1912760	This is Christine Chandler
1912760	1914760	coming to you live from home once again.
1914760	1916760	Chandler is an autistic trans woman.
1916760	1919760	And yes, I will be calling her by she or her pronouns,
1919760	1921760	which I pause to explain
1921760	1923760	because I don't think I've ever seen anyone
1923760	1925760	actually take her transition seriously.
1925760	1927760	Most people seem to regard it as
1927760	1929760	simply another absurd symptom
1929760	1931760	of her hilarious mental condition.
1931760	1932760	In fact, a bunch of trans people
1932760	1934760	will probably get real salty with me
1934760	1937760	for making trans people look bad
1937760	1939760	by including Chris-Chan in our Oats.
1939760	1943760	Oh, our very prestigious and exclusive club.
1943760	1944760	Oh, please.
1944760	1947760	Transsexualism is a deviant sexual identity, sweaty.
1947760	1950760	This is not the Princeton Alumni Yacht Society.
1950760	1953760	God, how did trannies get so snobbish?
1953760	1956760	Look, is Chris-Chan really trans?
1956760	1958760	I don't know.
1958760	1960760	And I don't care.
1960760	1962760	If Chris-Chan wants to be a woman,
1962760	1964760	I for one support her journey.
1964760	1965760	But it doesn't matter.
1965760	1967760	The relevant thing about Chris-Chan
1967760	1968760	is not Chris-Chan.
1968760	1971760	It's the fact that for the last 13 years,
1971760	1973760	nearly every aspect of her life
1973760	1976760	has been obsessively archived online
1976760	1980760	by thousands of voyeurs known as Chris-storians.
1980760	1983760	Chandler first acquired this anti-fandom
1983760	1985760	several internet centuries ago,
1985760	1987760	back in 2007,
1987760	1990760	when 4chan took notice of her comic book series Sonichu,
1990760	1994760	a childishly drawn hybrid of Sonic and Pikachu.
1994760	1997760	The comic is set in Quickville, CWC,
1997760	1999760	being Chris-Chan's initials.
1999760	2001760	The protagonist is a self-insert
2001760	2003760	who references Chandler's real-life
2003760	2004760	quote,
2004760	2005760	love quest
2005760	2006760	to find a quote,
2006760	2007760	boyfriend-free girl,
2007760	2009760	which apparently involved posting bizarre
2009760	2011760	attraction signs
2011760	2013760	around her community college.
2013760	2014760	For this story to make sense,
2014760	2015760	you have to keep in mind
2015760	2018760	that Chandler identified and presented as male
2018760	2019760	until 2015.
2019760	2022760	So these trolls saw her as like
2022760	2025760	the ultimate autistic incel man-child.
2025760	2027760	Just to give you a feel for this,
2027760	2029760	here's Christine in 2018
2029760	2032760	holding up the iconic pre-transition portrait.
2032760	2034760	Note the Sonichu medallions.
2034760	2035760	Here's the bedroom she lived in,
2035760	2037760	and here she is in recent years
2037760	2040760	giving us a full Bronycon eleganza.
2040760	2042760	Pegasister snapped.
2042760	2044760	Basically she's the entire cringetopia subreddit
2044760	2046760	condensed into a single person.
2046760	2049760	So 4chan zeroed right in on this shit,
2049760	2050760	cause of course they did,
2050760	2052760	and they began tormenting her
2052760	2055760	by creating pornographic parodies of Sonichu,
2055760	2056760	posting candid photos of her,
2056760	2058760	etc.
2058760	2059760	Chandler reacted to the trolls,
2059760	2061760	which of course encouraged them more,
2061760	2064760	and the harassment escalated and escalated.
2064760	2065760	They hacked her accounts,
2065760	2067760	or tricked her into giving out passwords,
2067760	2069760	they posted all her emails online,
2069760	2072760	they showed up in person and photographed her house,
2072760	2073760	they called her parents,
2073760	2074760	posing as friends,
2074760	2075760	psychiatrists,
2075760	2076760	journalists,
2076760	2077760	employers,
2077760	2079760	in order to extract as much information
2079760	2080760	about her as possible.
2080760	2083760	And of course they contacted Chandler herself,
2083760	2085760	which was very rewarding for trolls,
2085760	2087760	because she has no filter,
2087760	2089760	and was very naive and trusting.
2089760	2091760	So she was very willing to divulge,
2091760	2093760	or easily manipulated into divulging,
2093760	2096760	mortifying information about herself.
2096760	2098760	Sexual, psychological,
2098760	2099760	scatological,
2099760	2102760	there's not really any limits or boundaries to this.
2102760	2104760	For all the information they gathered,
2104760	2106760	the trolls created a wiki,
2106760	2107760	called the Quickie,
2107760	2109760	devoted to the obsessive compiling
2109760	2111760	of all Chris Chan data.
2111760	2114760	It includes a detailed diagram of her bedroom,
2114760	2118760	entire articles about all members of her immediate and extended family,
2118760	2122760	pages of psychiatric records she was tricked into sending them,
2122760	2124760	and that's only the beginning.
2124760	2127760	In their more grandiose moods,
2127760	2129760	the Chris-torians have speculated
2129760	2132760	that Chris Chan is the most documented life
2132760	2134760	in all human history,
2134760	2136760	comparing their social expair-tainment
2136760	2138760	to the Truman Show.
2138760	2140760	It's a level of obsession
2140760	2143760	that surpasses the wildest excesses of Stan culture.
2143760	2145760	It's a gaze into the abyss
2145760	2147760	that does not blink.
2149760	2152760	Some trolls have also sent taunting letters in packages,
2152760	2154760	or on one occasion, sex workers,
2154760	2156760	to the Chandler household.
2156760	2160760	Two female trolls actually went on real-life dates with Chris Chan,
2160760	2164760	of course secretly wearing wires to record their conversations.
2164760	2167760	Others pretended to be her internet girlfriends
2167760	2171760	so they could solicit and post nudes and masturbation videos.
2171760	2173760	These things must be awful.
2173760	2175760	They're archived, don't you understand?
2175760	2178760	Chris Chan must be documented.
2178760	2180760	The absolute low point came
2180760	2183760	when some trolls encouraged a 13-year-old boy
2183760	2186760	to pose as a 19-year-old girl
2186760	2189760	and have phone sex with Chris Chan and record it.
2189760	2190760	In other words,
2190760	2192760	they groomed a child
2192760	2194760	to deceive an autistic person
2194760	2198760	into performing sex acts for their entertainment.
2198760	2200760	Now, to contemporary Chris-torians,
2200760	2202760	this sort of sadistic interference
2202760	2204760	in Christine's life is frowned upon.
2204760	2206760	Not so much because it's immoral,
2206760	2209760	so much as because it's considered a bit tacky,
2209760	2211760	a bit attention-seeking.
2211760	2215760	No, to the sophisticated Chris-torian,
2215760	2217760	the real pleasure in all this
2217760	2220760	is supposed to lie in quietly spectating,
2220760	2223760	savoring the fine notes of cringe.
2223760	2226760	Now, I take it I don't even need to comment
2226760	2228760	on the morality of all this.
2228760	2231760	The real question to me is why?
2231760	2233760	Why do thousands of people
2233760	2237760	have a morbid obsession with Christine Chandler?
2237760	2239760	And yes, it is an obsession.
2239760	2241760	Just to give you a sense of a single individual's
2241760	2243760	personal investment in this,
2243760	2245760	the YouTuber Gino Samuel,
2245760	2247760	one of very few Chris-torians
2247760	2249760	with the audacity to show his face,
2249760	2252760	has been working for more than two years
2252760	2257760	to produce an eventual 100-episode documentary series
2257760	2259760	about the life of Chris Chan.
2259760	2261760	Gino has completed 36 episodes
2261760	2264760	so far, and each episode is around 40 minutes long,
2264760	2268760	meaning he's already produced around 24 hours of video
2268760	2270760	about the life of what is essentially
2270760	2272760	a random stranger.
2272760	2275760	I think this phenomenon deserves its own name.
2275760	2277760	I'll call it morbid cringe,
2277760	2279760	defined as an obsessive and addictive
2279760	2281760	contemptuous fascination
2281760	2284760	with a particular person or group.
2284760	2286760	Why does morbid cringe happen?
2286760	2288760	Well, I've spent some time
2288760	2290760	poring over Chris-torians' conversations
2290760	2291760	with each other,
2291760	2293760	and I've even interrogated a couple of them,
2293760	2295760	and this is what I've found.
2295760	2297760	The first thing they'll tell you is that
2297760	2299760	they just think it's funny and entertaining,
2299760	2301760	that Christine's strange life and mind
2301760	2304760	simply appeals to their morbid curiosity.
2304760	2306760	And I'm sure that's true.
2306760	2309760	But a lot of things are funny and entertaining
2309760	2311760	and morbidly interesting.
2311760	2314760	Why fixate on this particular person?
2314760	2317760	Well, for a lot of them, it's a reassurance
2317760	2319760	that there's someone out there
2319760	2321760	worse than them.
2321760	2323760	Maybe they're nerdy loners with no social skills,
2323760	2326760	but at least this defenseless punching bag
2326760	2328760	called Chris-Chan is here for them
2328760	2330760	to assert their superiority over.
2330760	2332760	It's pretty much common knowledge
2332760	2334760	that a lot of Chris-torians,
2334760	2336760	including some of the most vocal haters,
2336760	2338760	are autistic themselves.
2338760	2340760	And a frequent justification
2340760	2342760	given for trolling Chris-Chan
2342760	2346760	is that she's giving autistics a bad name.
2346760	2348760	In recent years, there's also been
2348760	2351760	a small contingent of transgender trolls
2351760	2353760	who are likewise prone to say,
2353760	2356760	he's not a real transgender like me
2356760	2359760	and he's making us all look bad.
2359760	2364760	Oh yeah, cause people who troll Chris-Chan?
2364760	2367760	You guys look amazing.
2367760	2370760	It's common for trolls to offer rationalizations like this
2370760	2373760	about why trolling Chandler is justified,
2373760	2375760	righteous even.
2375760	2377760	Because, at the end of the day,
2377760	2380760	trolls are people too.
2380760	2382760	And a lot of them actually do have
2382760	2384760	a guilty conscience about this,
2384760	2386760	which they suppress by insisting
2386760	2389760	that Chris-Chan is a horrible person
2389760	2391760	who deserves to be tormented.
2391760	2393760	But trolls who protest too much
2393760	2395760	about the evils of Chris-Chan,
2395760	2397760	and therefore reveal the excess
2397760	2400760	of their emotional investment in this,
2400760	2403760	are known in the community as A-logs.
2403760	2405760	A-log is the name of a troll
2405760	2407760	who attracted the eyes of people
2407760	2409760	who are aware of other trolls
2409760	2412760	by ranting about Chris-Chan's crimes,
2412760	2414760	comparing her to Hitler,
2414760	2418760	and generally betraying a pathological hate obsession.
2418760	2419760	Among the trolls,
2419760	2421760	this kind of behavior is considered
2421760	2423760	an embarrassment to all of them
2423760	2425760	because they want to feel
2425760	2428760	like they're just coolly and casually
2428760	2430760	toying with this person.
2430760	2433760	You know, just for laughs.
2433760	2435760	Not a big deal.
2435760	2437760	Perfectly healthy,
2437760	2438760	and normal,
2438760	2440760	and fine.
2440760	2442760	It's fine.
2443760	2446760	But A-log gave the lie to that illusion
2446760	2449760	because it was obvious that his Chris-Chan obsession
2449760	2451760	wasn't healthy,
2451760	2452760	or normal,
2452760	2454760	or fine.
2454760	2456760	So the other trolls turned on A-log,
2456760	2458760	and they made him into Chris-Chan 2.0,
2458760	2460760	and they uncovered his autism,
2460760	2462760	and his furry porn collection,
2462760	2464760	and his cringy erotic fanfiction.
2465760	2469760	So why would someone as similar to Chris-Chan as A-log
2469760	2471760	obsessively hate on her?
2471760	2473760	Well, there's two explanations.
2473760	2475760	One is troll-shielding.
2475760	2479760	That is, A-log may have performatively despised Chris-Chan
2479760	2481760	and spearheaded the trolling efforts
2481760	2483760	in order to protect himself
2483760	2485760	from being targeted by trolls.
2485760	2488760	The idea is that you can protect yourself from the mob
2488760	2491760	by waving your pitchfork the hardest.
2491760	2493760	Obviously, this did not work.
2493760	2495760	The other explanation is that,
2495760	2499760	A-log saw himself reflected in Chris-Chan,
2499760	2502760	and sort of projected his own shame
2502760	2505760	and self-contempt onto her.
2505760	2507760	A-log hated Chris-Chan
2507760	2509760	because he saw part of himself in her.
2509760	2512760	And the other trolls hated A-log
2512760	2515760	because they saw part of themselves in him.
2515760	2516760	To quote Margaret Pless,
2516760	2518760	who covered this story for New York Magazine
2518760	2519760	a few years ago,
2519760	2522760	I think it might be A-log's all the way down.
2522760	2525760	People form morbid cringe obsessions with Chris-Chan,
2525760	2527760	because to them she's a symbol
2527760	2529760	of something they hate about themselves,
2529760	2531760	something they're ashamed of.
2531760	2533760	Maybe it's being on the autism spectrum,
2533760	2536760	or being a socially awkward recluse.
2536760	2539760	Maybe it's being unemployed and living with their parents,
2539760	2542760	or an adulthood fixation on children's cartoons,
2542760	2545760	or embarrassing sexual proclivities,
2545760	2547760	or all of the above.
2547760	2549760	This is how scapegoating works, right?
2549760	2552760	You repress your uncomfortable feelings
2552760	2555760	of shame and insecurity and self-loathing.
2555760	2558760	And you displace them onto someone else,
2558760	2561760	usually someone you can feel superior to.
2561760	2564760	Then you blame and persecute the scapegoat,
2564760	2568760	transforming your painful shame and self-loathing
2568760	2571760	into pleasant, judgmental self-righteousness.
2571760	2573760	It's pretty safe to assume
2573760	2576760	that a large percentage of Christorians and trolls
2576760	2578760	are some kind of social outcasts,
2578760	2580760	much like Chris-Chan.
2580760	2584760	So bonding together over their shared contempt for Chris-Chan
2584760	2587760	is a way of processing the shame and anxiety
2587760	2590760	of social rejection and exclusion.
2590760	2593760	And I think for a lot of people, even normal people,
2593760	2596760	who aren't part of a bizarre internet stalker community,
2596760	2598760	contemptuous cringing helps us cope
2598760	2600760	with our own shame and insecurity.
2600760	2602760	Anyway, it's time to stop this tedious
2602760	2604760	empathizing with other people
2604760	2607760	and find a way to make this all about me.
2614760	2638760	.
2638760	2639760	Meow meow.
2639760	2642760	Would you like to meet my quarantine boyfriend?
2642760	2643760	Would you like to meet my...
2643760	2644760	.
2644760	2645760	boyfriend's boyfriend?
2645760	2646760	That's right, honey,
2646760	2648760	I'm giving you fujoshi realness, nya.
2648760	2650760	He's gonna stay right here as a grim reminder
2650760	2652760	of the things that you have seen.
2652760	2654760	Actually, I identify as a trap.
2654760	2655760	It's very that.
2655760	2658760	I guess it's not really cringe if I'm trying to be cringe.
2658760	2660760	Cringe is failed seriousness.
2660760	2661760	In my last video,
2661760	2663760	I talked about how ashamed I am
2663760	2665760	of being a transgender lesbian.
2665760	2666760	Cringe.
2666760	2667760	Shame.
2667760	2668760	At the end of that video,
2668760	2670760	I talk about how I sense that my shame
2670760	2673760	is related to the contemptuous cringe I feel
2673760	2675760	for a lot of other trans lesbians,
2675760	2677760	particularly those of the heckin' stripey sock,
2677760	2679760	nya nya, catgirl variety.
2679760	2682760	But I confess to periodically sinking
2682760	2685760	into these morbid, guilty binges
2685760	2687760	of cringing at embarrassing trans lesbians.
2687760	2689760	I want to return to that thought
2689760	2691760	and kind of psychoanalyze myself
2691760	2693760	as a kind of first-person case study
2693760	2695760	of a morbid cringe obsession.
2695760	2699760	So, uh, catgirl trans girls are...
2699760	2702760	Okay, I can't believe I'm about to explain this.
2702760	2705760	They're trans women, usually attracted to women,
2705760	2708760	who express their identity online
2708760	2713760	through cloying, neotenous, otaku memery.
2713760	2715760	And my conscious reason for cringing at them
2715760	2719760	is that I see these Japanese cartoon catgirls
2719760	2721760	as a kind of visual baby talk,
2721760	2724760	an infantilized and unrealistic representation
2724760	2726760	of femininity and womanhood
2726760	2729760	that's designed to titillate nerdy boys.
2729760	2731760	So when trans women identify with it,
2731760	2732760	I cringe.
2732760	2733760	Like, no.
2733760	2735760	You can't become an anime girl, Lily.
2735760	2737760	Fuck your dreams.
2737760	2739760	Now look, I don't want to get sidetracked
2739760	2741760	with a discussion of whether my opinions
2741760	2743760	about catgirls are fair or correct.
2743760	2746760	So don't listen to what I'm saying about catgirls.
2746760	2749760	Listen to what I'm feeling about catgirls.
2749760	2752760	Listen to the contempt beneath my words.
2752760	2755760	Because even if everything I'm saying is true,
2755760	2758760	catgirls are being cringe online
2758760	2760760	is a situation so inconsequential
2760760	2764760	that any amount of emotional energy spent on it
2764760	2765760	is too much.
2765760	2768760	So why do I have this cringe fixation?
2768760	2772760	Well, according to the A-log theory of morbid cringing,
2772760	2774760	we form obsessive and addictive contempt
2774760	2777760	for people who have traits in common with us,
2777760	2779760	people who make us uncomfortable
2779760	2782760	because we see something of ourselves in them.
2782760	2785760	So do I have traits in common with the catgirls?
2785760	2788760	Well, we're both trans women,
2788760	2790760	we're both attracted to women,
2790760	2794760	uh, I do like anime, but
2794760	2796760	I don't like the anime they like, okay?
2796760	2799760	I like good anime that has, you know,
2799760	2801760	mature, three-dimensional female characters.
2801760	2803760	Look, I'm a real transgender, okay?
2803760	2804760	I'm not like you.
2804760	2806760	It's also not lost on me that this is like
2806760	2807760	the seventh time on this channel
2807760	2809760	I've dressed as a catgirl
2809760	2811760	to make fun of them.
2814760	2816760	I have posted cringe.
2816760	2818760	You should all be laughing at me right now.
2818760	2820760	Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah.
2820760	2822760	So I do think there's some truth to the idea
2822760	2824760	that I'm A-logging these catgirls.
2824760	2827760	I also think there's a group representation aspect to this.
2827760	2830760	Like, I'm afraid that other people will cringe
2830760	2833760	at a group that includes me, trans lesbians,
2833760	2835760	because of how these catgirls are acting.
2835760	2837760	So let's make another distinction between
2837760	2839760	in-group cringe and out-group cringe.
2839760	2841760	In-group cringe is when you cringe at someone
2841760	2843760	who belongs to the same group identity as you.
2843760	2846760	For example, your family, your romantic partnership,
2846760	2848760	your ethnicity, or your country.
2848760	2850760	Particularly if they're embarrassing themselves
2850760	2852760	in front of outsiders to the group.
2852760	2855760	Think about how embarrassed a teenager gets
2855760	2857760	if her mom does something cringey in front of her friends.
2857760	2860760	Or think about how embarrassed liberal Americans get
2860760	2862760	when we talk to foreigners about Donald Trump
2862760	2864760	being our president.
2864760	2866760	Or think about these phrases.
2866760	2868760	She makes me embarrassed to be a YouTuber.
2868760	2870760	They're making trans people look bad.
2870760	2872760	He's giving autistics a bad name.
2872760	2875760	When we cringe at someone who belongs to our identity group,
2875760	2877760	we don't just feel vicarious embarrassment,
2877760	2880760	we feel embarrassment,
2880760	2883760	because their disgraceful behavior makes us look bad too.
2883760	2887760	So in-group cringe is actually a kind of self-cringe,
2887760	2889760	because you're cringing at your membership
2889760	2891760	in an embarrassing group.
2891760	2893760	Nothing has ever triggered this kind of
2893760	2895760	in-group embarrassment more for me
2895760	2897760	than a cringe video that went viral last year,
2897760	2901760	in which a masculine trans woman throws a tantrum
2901760	2903760	over being misgendered in a GameStop.
2903760	2905760	You're not getting my fucking money back!
2905760	2907760	Excuse me sir, there's a young man in here.
2907760	2909760	Excuse me, it's ma'am.
2909760	2911760	It is ma'am!
2911760	2914760	This video is excruciating for me to watch.
2914760	2916760	Motherfucker, take it outside!
2916760	2918760	If you want to call me sir again,
2918760	2920760	I will show you a fucking sir!
2920760	2922760	Motherfucker!
2923760	2926760	The paradoxical absurdity of trying to brutishly
2926760	2929760	intimidate people into seeing you as a woman.
2932760	2934760	Now Twitter's gonna come for me over this and say,
2934760	2936760	Natalie hates trans women, hey don't pass!
2936760	2939760	But passing is really not what this is about.
2939760	2944760	It's aggressive, intimidating, hyper-masculine behavior
2944760	2947760	from a trans woman, accompanied by apparently
2947760	2950760	total delusion about how she's presenting.
2950760	2952760	Well I'm gonna ask you for the fifth time
2952760	2954760	to stop calling me a man!
2954760	2956760	Because quite clearly I am not!
2956760	2958760	It's really not that clear, Gorge.
2958760	2960760	And that's what makes this video classic cringe, right?
2960760	2963760	The incongruity between her thinking that
2963760	2965760	she's serving women, while
2965760	2968760	bellowing like a drill sergeant.
2968760	2969760	By the way, what I'm doing right now,
2969760	2971760	this is cringe reaction content.
2971760	2973760	I don't really do that on this channel, but
2973760	2975760	I'm dipping my toe in just to see how it feels.
2975760	2977760	And it feels good. Like,
2977760	2979760	intoxicatingly good.
2979760	2981760	I can see how you could get addicted to this.
2981760	2983760	I'm imagining myself right now,
2983760	2985760	surrounded by cis people,
2985760	2987760	and I am leading the righteous mob
2987760	2989760	as we point and laugh
2989760	2992760	at some delusional, manly dump truck.
2992760	2994760	I am a real transgender.
2994760	2995760	A true transgender.
2995760	2997760	A good transgender.
2997760	2999760	Father finally approves of me.
2999760	3002760	Uh, this would be the unconscious, archetypal father.
3002760	3004760	Jot that down in my progress notes please, Doctor.
3004760	3006760	Okay, so why does this feel so good?
3006760	3008760	Well, let me talk you through my feelings.
3008760	3010760	When I watched that GameStop video,
3010760	3012760	for the first few seconds,
3012760	3014760	I do feel vicarious embarrassment for her.
3014760	3016760	I can even relate, cause in the first couple months
3016760	3018760	of my transition, there was an occasion
3018760	3020760	where I was in a lengthy
3020760	3022760	customer service interaction
3022760	3024760	where the guy at the desk was
3024760	3026760	calling me sir the entire time.
3026760	3028760	And there's something very humiliating
3028760	3030760	about trying to present female,
3030760	3032760	like wearing a dress and makeup,
3032760	3034760	and yet being called sir.
3034760	3036760	It's a quintessential mismatch between
3036760	3038760	self-concept and the way other people are seeing you.
3038760	3040760	And the memory of it is painful to me,
3040760	3042760	but what I cling to
3042760	3044760	is that while I may have
3044760	3046760	looked like a man, at least
3046760	3048760	I didn't act like a man.
3048760	3050760	I didn't threaten to take anyone outside
3050760	3052760	and show them a sir.
3052760	3054760	In fact, I was too ashamed to even
3054760	3056760	correct the guy.
3056760	3058760	So as the GameStop video progresses,
3058760	3060760	my sympathy runs out fast.
3060760	3062760	And instead of compassionate cringe,
3062760	3064760	I feel group embarrassment for trans women,
3064760	3066760	including myself.
3066760	3068760	And I feel contempt toward this individual
3068760	3070760	for making us all look bad.
3070760	3072760	I also feel a kind of morbid
3072760	3074760	fascination rooted in fear.
3074760	3076760	What if I'm as delusional as
3076760	3078760	that trans woman?
3078760	3080760	I don't look and sound like that, do I?
3080760	3082760	I feel like I have to do a sanity check.
3082760	3084760	I start scrutinizing myself in the mirror,
3084760	3086760	because of my voice, just to make sure.
3086760	3088760	And that fear motivates me to distance
3088760	3090760	myself from that person in the video.
3090760	3092760	I don't feel compassion for her,
3092760	3094760	because that would mean putting myself
3094760	3096760	in her size 16 shoes.
3096760	3098760	And I don't want to do that,
3098760	3100760	because I'm horrified and repulsed
3100760	3102760	by the thought that I'm like her in some way.
3102760	3104760	So I want to push away.
3104760	3106760	And contempt is a way of emotionally
3106760	3108760	distancing myself.
3108760	3110760	And if I express that contempt by publicly
3110760	3112760	shaming and condemning her,
3112760	3114760	then I'm also socially distancing myself.
3114760	3116760	Oops. Guess it's, uh,
3116760	3118760	contagious.
3118760	3120760	I think many people who are stigmatized
3120760	3122760	or who have been humiliated
3122760	3124760	long for the experience
3124760	3126760	of being a normal, surrounded
3126760	3128760	by fellow normals, judging
3128760	3130760	and humiliating a freak.
3130760	3132760	And if you take a look around trans YouTube,
3132760	3134760	a lot of the biggest creators in the
3134760	3136760	platform have channels
3136760	3138760	basically devoted to exactly
3138760	3140760	this type of cringe reaction
3140760	3142760	humilitainment. The YouTuber
3142760	3144760	Calvin Guerra is a trans guy whose best
3144760	3146760	known for what are essentially cringe
3146760	3148760	reaction videos, mostly aimed at
3148760	3150760	people he deems trans-trenders.
3150760	3152760	That is, people who claim to be
3152760	3154760	trans, but who aren't real
3154760	3156760	transgenders like Calvin.
3156760	3158760	He's especially bothered by girly,
3158760	3160760	afab, trans and non-binary
3160760	3162760	teenagers, or by anyone who
3162760	3164760	blurs the line between lesbian
3164760	3166760	and transmasculine identities.
3166760	3168760	Sometimes he'll do a long-form reaction to a
3168760	3170760	specific person who grinds his gears.
3170760	3172760	So this person is an asexual,
3172760	3174760	non-binary,
3174760	3176760	transgender,
3176760	3178760	lesbian, who uses he,
3178760	3180760	they, it, thons
3180760	3182760	pronouns. According to my calculations,
3182760	3184760	you are a trans-trender.
3184760	3186760	In other times, he'll basically
3186760	3188760	just laugh at cringy trans TikTok
3188760	3190760	teens.
3190760	3192760	No, no, I'm
3192760	3194760	turning off the video. I can't watch
3194760	3196760	this. He has a couple justifications
3196760	3198760	for making these videos. One is that he's
3198760	3200760	actually helping the people he's cringing at,
3200760	3202760	because if a trender transitions,
3202760	3204760	then they'll get dysphoria and have to detrend.
3204760	3206760	But I have to wonder,
3206760	3208760	does humiliating or laughing at people
3208760	3210760	really help them figure out whether they're trans
3210760	3212760	or not? His other justification is that
3212760	3214760	trans-trenders are giving real trans
3214760	3216760	people a bad name. They're the reason
3216760	3218760	people are transphobic. This is why
3218760	3220760	they hate us. It's because of
3220760	3222760	the trenders. Wow, I love
3222760	3224760	that idea of a true scum furry.
3224760	3226760	Isn't that just, isn't that just
3226760	3228760	wonderful? A true scum furry!
3228760	3230760	Uh, but it's not, though.
3230760	3232760	I mean, transphobia existed
3232760	3234760	long before there were people you could plausibly
3234760	3236760	describe as trans-trenders.
3236760	3238760	So trans-trenders aren't the reason
3238760	3240760	society hates trans people, Calvin.
3240760	3242760	They're the reason you hate trans people, right?
3242760	3244760	Or at least the trans community. And I feel like
3244760	3246760	what you're doing is you're projecting that feeling onto
3246760	3248760	society at large, and you're saying,
3248760	3250760	oh, this is the reason people are transphobic.
3250760	3252760	And to be fair, I get that it's not
3252760	3254760	just a projection. Like, back in
3254760	3256760	2016, the SJW cringe era,
3256760	3258760	it was cis people mocking
3258760	3260760	trans people with all these tropes.
3260760	3262760	Attack helicopter, two genders,
3262760	3264760	36 genders, special snowflakes.
3264760	3266760	But now, they're used by trans people
3266760	3268760	trying to distance themselves,
3268760	3270760	trying to ghettoize the most laughed at
3270760	3272760	people in the community under the label of
3272760	3274760	trans-trenders. And Calvin, there may
3274760	3276760	be some truth to what you're saying about there being
3276760	3278760	confused teenagers who think they're trans when
3278760	3280760	they're not. I mean, I wouldn't know. I'm a
3280760	3282760	near-dead woman in the twilight of my life, and I don't
3282760	3284760	hang out with teenagers. But even if it is true,
3284760	3286760	Calvin, your fixation
3286760	3288760	on it seems disproportionate to me.
3288760	3290760	Like, you return to this topic to cringe
3290760	3292760	again and again and again
3292760	3294760	and again and again and again. It's like you're
3294760	3296760	picking at a wound. It feels to me
3296760	3298760	like a morbid cringe obsession.
3298760	3300760	And I guess I think I recognize
3300760	3302760	part of myself in you. This could be
3302760	3304760	me projecting, of course, but I
3304760	3306760	wonder if the way you feel about
3306760	3308760	girly, sparkle-gender AFABs
3308760	3310760	is similar to the way I feel about
3310760	3312760	otaku, transbian catgirls.
3312760	3314760	And it might be worth considering
3314760	3316760	that I don't cringe at the
3316760	3318760	sparkle genders the way you do. I mean, I'm
3318760	3320760	with you on wondering what a hey-they-zeer
3320760	3322760	gender-flux lesbian demi-boy
3322760	3324760	is. But unlike you, Calvin,
3324760	3326760	I just don't have a morbid cringe obsession
3326760	3328760	with feminine AFAB trans people.
3328760	3330760	They can identify as however many genders
3330760	3332760	they want for all I care. I may not always
3332760	3334760	understand it, but I support
3334760	3336760	their journey. I guess it doesn't bother
3336760	3338760	me, because I'm not worried that anyone
3338760	3340760	will judge me because of how they
3340760	3342760	behave. I don't feel in-group cringe.
3342760	3344760	Now it's a different story if I'm reading
3344760	3346760	a general lesbian subreddit and I
3346760	3348760	see a comment like,
3348760	3350760	Pre-transition trans lesbian here.
3350760	3352760	I wish I had titties. Girl,
3352760	3354760	dick, nyah-nyah. Get the fuck out of here,
3354760	3356760	Billy. You're giving real trans
3356760	3358760	lesbians a bad name. This is why they
3358760	3360760	hate us. See, now I
3360760	3362760	have strong feelings. Now
3362760	3364760	I'm in-group cringing. And intellectually,
3364760	3366760	I do think my feelings are
3366760	3368760	correct to some extent.
3368760	3370760	Like, I don't think a general lesbian
3370760	3372760	community is the appropriate
3372760	3374760	forum for a trans woman who's
3374760	3376760	effectively still living as a man
3376760	3378760	to take the mic and whine about
3378760	3380760	wanting titties or rhapsodize
3380760	3382760	about girl dick. But I'm also
3382760	3384760	aware that I feel this strongly
3384760	3386760	about this because of my own
3386760	3388760	dysphoria. And my own shame.
3388760	3390760	And honestly, my own
3390760	3392760	self-loathing. Like, I can't
3392760	3394760	even talk to cis women on dating
3394760	3396760	apps because I feel like a fake woman
3396760	3398760	imposing myself on real women.
3398760	3400760	That's where my head is at. So
3400760	3402760	where does this pre-transition
3402760	3404760	trans lesbian get the
3404760	3406760	audacity? You know, it makes me feel in-group
3406760	3408760	cringe about an identity,
3408760	3410760	trans lesbianism, which for me
3410760	3412760	is already a pain point of
3412760	3414760	insecurity and embarrassment
3414760	3416760	and shame. So Calvin, maybe
3416760	3418760	and again, I could just be projecting,
3418760	3420760	but maybe, that's
3420760	3422760	kind of like how you feel about these trenders.
3422760	3424760	When you make these videos condemning
3424760	3426760	them as not really trans, aren't
3426760	3428760	you essentially exiling them from
3428760	3430760	the in-group so you no longer feel
3430760	3432760	the pain of in-group cringe?
3432760	3434760	Or perhaps, Calvin Guerra,
3434760	3436760	what you're really trying
3436760	3438760	to destroy is the trender
3438760	3440760	within.
3440760	3442760	And again, I could be
3442760	3444760	full of shit here. At the end of the day,
3444760	3446760	this is psychoanalysis of a YouTuber
3446760	3448760	I haven't met. So feel free
3448760	3450760	to tell me if I'm full of shit, Calvin.
3450760	3452760	But still, I guess I invite
3452760	3454760	you to consider whether
3454760	3456760	producing trans trender
3456760	3458760	humilatainment is actually helping anything,
3458760	3460760	or whether it's really
3460760	3462760	just an addictive way to
3462760	3464760	scratch some kind of emotional itch.
3464760	3466760	Alright, I've said my piece about Calvin.
3466760	3468760	Who's next?
3468760	3470760	Oh, how about
3470760	3472760	Vanessa. We meet again here.
3472760	3474760	And once again, I'm wearing some
3474760	3476760	kind of embarrassing anime hairpiece.
3476760	3478760	Vanessa is a trans woman who
3478760	3480760	is the second most popular
3480760	3482760	political trans YouTuber.
3482760	3484760	At least that's what I wrote in the script when I
3484760	3486760	had more subscribers than her and was fully
3486760	3488760	prepared to be a cunt about it, but
3488760	3490760	since then, she has
3490760	3492760	in fact surpassed me once again.
3492760	3494760	Good for her. Vanessa started out as
3494760	3496760	basically a cringe reaction channel
3496760	3498760	back when SJW cringe was fashionable.
3498760	3500760	She cringed at a wide variety of SJWs,
3500760	3502760	but the most consistent theme was
3502760	3504760	trans trenders and crazy activists
3504760	3506760	are giving real trans people a bad name.
3506760	3508760	They're making us look bad.
3508760	3510760	This is why people hate us.
3510760	3512760	So what we can now recognize as a standard
3512760	3514760	in-group cringe fixation.
3514760	3516760	But Vanessa focused in particular
3516760	3518760	on a strident
3518760	3520760	SJW type trans woman
3520760	3522760	called Riley Dennis.
3522760	3524760	And Vanessa made several reaction
3524760	3526760	videos to her where she made a point
3526760	3528760	of misgendering Riley and
3528760	3530760	dismissing her as a fake
3530760	3532760	transgender who hadn't
3532760	3534760	transitioned and clearly
3534760	3536760	had no intention to.
3536760	3538760	You know, if you went on estrogen,
3538760	3540760	your sex drive wouldn't be so high and you
3540760	3542760	wouldn't be guilt tripping people into having sex with you.
3542760	3544760	Just saying.
3544760	3546760	But then, Riley made a video
3546760	3548760	revealing that she'd been on hormone therapy
3548760	3550760	for a year and was about to
3550760	3552760	undergo facial feminization surgery.
3552760	3554760	This prompted Vanessa
3554760	3556760	to make an apology video where she
3556760	3558760	not only apologized to Riley
3558760	3560760	and acknowledged her transition, but she
3560760	3562760	actually went beyond the script of a
3562760	3564760	generic oopsie doopsie YouTube video
3564760	3566760	and opened up about having
3566760	3568760	experienced herself the cruelty
3568760	3570760	she directed at Riley.
3570760	3572760	I'm someone who's had my transition
3572760	3574760	picked apart online.
3574760	3576760	There have been Reddit threads and 4chan
3576760	3578760	threads with hundreds of comments on it
3578760	3580760	of people trying to prove that I'm not trans
3580760	3582760	because I haven't done this or that
3582760	3584760	or, you know, digging up my old pictures
3584760	3586760	and so the thought that this entire
3586760	3588760	time I've done that exact
3588760	3590760	same thing to someone else
3590760	3592760	and pushed that off on someone else
3592760	3594760	fucks with me.
3594760	3596760	And I'm fucking sorry.
3596760	3598760	Vanessa actually managed
3598760	3600760	for one fleeting moment
3600760	3602760	to make a connection between
3602760	3604760	her own past hurt and trauma
3604760	3606760	and the pain she'd inflicted on another
3606760	3608760	person. Which is kind of a once in a lifetime
3608760	3610760	event on a website
3610760	3612760	where the performers are remorseless
3612760	3614760	psychopaths who wouldn't muddy their
3614760	3616760	shoes to save a drowning child
3616760	3618760	and the viewers are cold blooded
3618760	3620760	sadists who consume human misery
3620760	3622760	like a glutton, gorging him
3622760	3624760	at a particularly
3624760	3626760	sumptuous buffet.
3626760	3628760	You know, this whole thing has really taught me a lesson
3628760	3630760	that I should really try to stick to
3630760	3632760	ideas, opinions,
3632760	3634760	policy.
3634760	3636760	However, this lesson would not last.
3636760	3638760	Vanessa kept doing
3638760	3640760	SJW cringe content
3640760	3642760	well past the point it had become
3642760	3644760	passÃ©, making a video with
3644760	3646760	Big Red in the thumbnail
3646760	3648760	as recently as 2019.
3648760	3650760	I admit, I thought she was
3650760	3652760	fading into irrelevance.
3652760	3654760	But again, I underestimated Vanessa.
3654760	3656760	In July 2019,
3656760	3658760	her channel rocketed to a new
3658760	3660760	level of success when she released
3660760	3662760	a video titled
3662760	3664760	Exposing Jessica Yaniv
3664760	3666760	Trans Predator.
3666760	3668760	In this video, Vanessa sounds the alarm
3668760	3670760	about a trans woman, or rather
3670760	3672760	she believes, a man posing
3672760	3674760	as a trans woman, called
3674760	3676760	Jessica Yaniv.
3676760	3678760	Who the fuck is Jessica Yaniv?
3678760	3680760	Well, as far as
3680760	3682760	I can tell, everything
3682760	3684760	Vanessa says about Yaniv
3684760	3686760	is true. Yaniv attempted
3686760	3688760	to use a Canadian human rights
3688760	3690760	tribunal to close down several
3690760	3692760	beauty salons that had refused to wax
3692760	3694760	her hairy balls after she approached
3694760	3696760	them about it in an awkward and creepy
3696760	3698760	way. She has a long history of sending
3698760	3700760	extremely inappropriate
3700760	3702760	messages to underage girls.
3702760	3704760	And, she attempted to host
3704760	3706760	a topless pool party
3706760	3708760	for unchaperoned children.
3708760	3710760	Basically, Yaniv is someone who
3710760	3712760	appropriates the language of
3712760	3714760	transgender acceptance and equality
3714760	3716760	to cloak predatory behavior
3716760	3718760	toward minors. And my read
3718760	3720760	on Yaniv, by the way, is not
3720760	3722760	that she's a cunning manipulator,
3722760	3724760	but that this is someone who is
3724760	3726760	mentally not playing
3726760	3728760	with a full deck. After the success
3728760	3730760	of her initial video, Vanessa
3730760	3732760	made a few more videos about Yaniv
3732760	3734760	rebranding herself as a kind of
3734760	3736760	transsexual Chris Hansen,
3736760	3738760	exposing TRANSGENDER
3738760	3740760	PREDATORS wherever
3740760	3742760	she could find them. And it
3742760	3744760	turns out, first, I was honestly
3744760	3746760	kind of loving this for Vanessa.
3746760	3748760	At least now she's finally picking on
3748760	3750760	someone who deserves it. But the more
3750760	3752760	I think about it, the more
3752760	3754760	hesitations I have. One,
3754760	3756760	is that Vanessa framed the Yaniv
3756760	3758760	story and the lack of attention
3758760	3760760	given to it by other trans public
3760760	3762760	figures as an indictment of
3762760	3764760	trans activists.
3764760	3766760	Who Vanessa thinks should spend more time
3766760	3768760	sounding the alarm about
3768760	3770760	TRANSGENDER
3770760	3772760	PREDATORS. And I'm willing to
3772760	3774760	admit, there's probably
3774760	3776760	a valid point in there somewhere.
3776760	3778760	Like, some trans people really are
3778760	3780760	so paranoid about transphobes framing
3780760	3782760	all of us as dangerous perverts
3782760	3784760	that they basically look the other
3784760	3786760	way and refuse to acknowledge
3786760	3788760	the small but real subset of trans
3788760	3790760	people who are, in fact,
3790760	3792760	dangerous perverts. But Blair,
3792760	3794760	you talk about the Yaniv
3794760	3796760	situation like it's urgent
3796760	3798760	breaking news. Like Yaniv should
3798760	3800760	rightfully be a household name,
3800760	3802760	but for the stubborn silence of trans
3802760	3804760	activists. But why?
3804760	3806760	Why should everyone be focused
3806760	3808760	on Jessica Yaniv? There's more
3808760	3810760	than 100,000 sexual assaults
3810760	3812760	reported to American law enforcement
3812760	3814760	every year. The literal president of
3814760	3816760	America is a bit of a sexual
3816760	3818760	predator himself. Why
3818760	3820760	fixate on this one particular
3820760	3822760	Canadian creep? I guess you could
3822760	3824760	argue that since Yaniv is a
3824760	3826760	trans-identified predator,
3826760	3828760	a tip. We as real trans
3828760	3830760	people have a responsibility
3830760	3832760	to be the ones who lead the charge to stop
3832760	3834760	her. Or at least it would be good
3834760	3836760	optics for us to do that.
3836760	3838760	And again, I think there's maybe some truth
3838760	3840760	to that, like initially
3840760	3842760	the LGBT website Pink News
3842760	3844760	straightforwardly reported Yaniv's
3844760	3846760	claims of discrimination, which
3846760	3848760	is pretty embarrassing and
3848760	3850760	not great optics, but I don't think
3850760	3852760	that constantly broadcasting
3852760	3854760	updates about the trans
3854760	3856760	gender is really the best
3856760	3858760	optics for us either. Why did
3858760	3860760	Vanessa make this video in the first place?
3860760	3862760	Is it simply because she
3862760	3864760	cares deeply about the well-being
3864760	3866760	of children, and she
3866760	3868760	thought making a video exposing
3868760	3870760	Jessica Yaniv is the best
3870760	3872760	way to protect them?
3872760	3874760	I mean, I'm sure she cares a little
3874760	3876760	bit about the children, but it's
3876760	3878760	still a YouTube video, and
3878760	3880760	you have to ask, is the
3880760	3882760	primary intention here really
3882760	3884760	to stop a predator? Or
3884760	3886760	is it to manufacture
3886760	3888760	a sleazy entertainment
3888760	3890760	spectacle? Shortly after her
3890760	3892760	first Yaniv video was published,
3892760	3894760	Vanessa hosted a live stream
3894760	3896760	on her channel titled
3896760	3898760	Heated Debate with Jessica Yaniv
3898760	3900760	Trans Predator.
3900760	3902760	This got 2 million views.
3902760	3904760	Is this what you do with
3904760	3906760	someone you've just accused of
3906760	3908760	pedophilia? You host a live
3908760	3910760	event debating
3910760	3912760	the pedophile on your YouTube
3912760	3914760	channel? What's to debate?
3914760	3916760	I don't need to be scared in my own house
3916760	3918760	that I'm gonna get fucking attacked
3918760	3920760	which is illegal
3920760	3922760	in Canada, just saying. But
3922760	3924760	you think that was, like, cute?
3926760	3928760	Was that a moment for you?
3928760	3930760	Then of course, you sell t-shirts
3930760	3932760	featuring the meme that resulted
3932760	3934760	from your YouTube pedophile
3934760	3936760	debate. I mean, that makes sense.
3936760	3938760	If you're gonna catch a predator,
3938760	3940760	you gotta sell pedophile debate
3940760	3942760	merch. And of course, you
3942760	3944760	gotta follow the pedophile's makeup
3944760	3946760	tutorial, you know,
3946760	3948760	for the children.
3948760	3950760	Now, I hate to be overly
3950760	3952760	critical, but when I look
3952760	3954760	at this, I don't see
3954760	3956760	a high-minded activist
3956760	3958760	working to protect children and
3958760	3960760	trans people's image. I see
3960760	3962760	a tabloid entertainer
3962760	3964760	who's discovered a way to
3964760	3966760	monetize milking lulz
3966760	3968760	from a mentally defective
3968760	3970760	pervert. And I have to say,
3970760	3972760	Blair, as a connoisseur of trash
3972760	3974760	myself, I'm very entertained
3974760	3976760	by all of this. Following
3976760	3978760	a sexual predator's makeup
3978760	3980760	tutorial? That's
3980760	3982760	genius. I wish I'd
3982760	3984760	thought of that. But just be honest.
3984760	3986760	This isn't activism.
3986760	3988760	This isn't justice.
3988760	3990760	It's a lolcow cult.
3990760	3992760	It's like one of Mari's transsexuals
3992760	3994760	took over the show. And I love
3994760	3996760	that for her. I love that
3996760	3998760	for her. But Blair,
3998760	4000760	I can't help but notice
4000760	4002760	you're still hitting all the
4002760	4004760	same beats your videos have always
4004760	4006760	hit. Attention, everyone.
4006760	4008760	There is a bad
4008760	4010760	transgender in our midst.
4010760	4012760	The bad transgender
4012760	4014760	is not a real transgender like
4014760	4016760	me. It's very important
4016760	4018760	that we all gather round
4018760	4020760	to condemn this bad
4020760	4022760	transgender who is not a real
4022760	4024760	transgender. And Blair, I'll give you
4024760	4026760	this. You are getting better at
4026760	4028760	choosing your targets. The transvestite
4028760	4030760	monster is a stock character in
4030760	4032760	our culture, and Jessica Yaniv
4032760	4034760	is good casting for the part.
4034760	4036760	She's a transphobe's boogeyman
4036760	4038760	come to life, and I certainly
4038760	4040760	am not shedding any tears for her. But
4040760	4042760	you'll have to excuse me if I don't take this
4042760	4044760	seriously as anything more than
4044760	4046760	a smarter version of the same
4046760	4048760	in-group cringe humilitainment
4048760	4050760	you've always made. And by the way,
4050760	4052760	you may want to check in
4052760	4054760	on your understudy, Rose of Dawn.
4054760	4056760	Rose of Dawn is another
4056760	4058760	conservative trans woman YouTuber
4058760	4060760	who produces a series called Trans
4060760	4062760	Stupid. Hi, everyone, and
4062760	4064760	welcome to another edition of Trans
4064760	4066760	Stupid, the show where I take a look at the
4066760	4068760	wonderful world of LGBTQIA++
4068760	4070760	news because
4070760	4072760	stupidity is intersectional.
4072760	4074760	Transgender.
4074760	4076760	More like trans
4076760	4078760	retarded. More like trans
4078760	4080760	gay.
4080760	4082760	Trans gay.
4082760	4084760	I love that. I'm literally, I just
4084760	4086760	realized I'm literally trans gay. Rose's
4086760	4088760	channel is allegedly about the
4088760	4090760	excesses of trans ideology
4090760	4092760	and activism, which in theory
4092760	4094760	I do think is a perspective
4094760	4096760	worth including in the conversation.
4096760	4098760	But in practice,
4098760	4100760	well, let's just say Rose
4100760	4102760	has produced a 30-minute documentary
4102760	4104760	about why Chris Chan is not
4104760	4106760	a real transgender. There is a
4106760	4108760	bad transgender in our
4108760	4110760	midst. The bad transgender
4110760	4112760	is not a real transgender
4112760	4114760	like me. I'm getting pretty tired
4114760	4116760	of this. And here's her transition advice
4116760	4118760	to trans women just beginning their
4118760	4120760	journey. You probably have this image in your
4120760	4122760	head that, you know, you're going to be this really
4122760	4124760	cute-looking trans
4124760	4126760	woman. Like, effectively, you're going to be this
4126760	4128760	seal. Like, look at this seal.
4128760	4130760	Isn't this seal adorable?
4130760	4132760	You're so cute. But
4132760	4134760	the truth is, you're probably not
4134760	4136760	looking like this seal right now, are you?
4136760	4138760	You're probably more like this big
4138760	4140760	bull seal, barging your
4140760	4142760	way into women's bathrooms
4142760	4144760	saying, this is a woman's
4144760	4146760	body. Now,
4146760	4148760	you might never reach the
4148760	4150760	cute seal phase. In fact,
4150760	4152760	very few of us turn out to look like Blair White.
4152760	4154760	Rose, no.
4154760	4156760	Do not simp for Vanessa.
4156760	4158760	It only encourages her. She's also
4158760	4160760	made no less than 20
4160760	4162760	videos about Jessica Yaniv.
4162760	4164760	Which seems like kind of a lot,
4164760	4166760	Gorge. Would I be wrong to say I'm
4166760	4168760	getting a little bit of a morbid cringe addiction
4168760	4170760	vibe? In these videos, Rose
4170760	4172760	chronicles Yaniv's numerous crimes and
4172760	4174760	wrongdoings, but she also
4174760	4176760	cannot resist making it
4176760	4178760	very clear how disgusted
4178760	4180760	she is with Yaniv's
4180760	4182760	appearance. The irony being
4182760	4184760	that this kind of tweet came from someone who you
4184760	4186760	could smell just by looking at
4186760	4188760	a picture of them. I bring this up,
4188760	4190760	again, not because I have
4190760	4192760	any interest at all in white knighting
4192760	4194760	for Yaniv. I do not support
4194760	4196760	her journey. As far as I'm concerned,
4196760	4198760	she can eat shit. And maybe
4198760	4200760	she does. I wouldn't be surprised.
4200760	4202760	No, my point is that part of the
4202760	4204760	catharsis that Rose and Vanessa
4204760	4206760	seem to derive from making
4206760	4208760	this kind of content
4208760	4210760	comes from contrasting themselves
4210760	4212760	as good, presentable,
4212760	4214760	real trans people with
4214760	4216760	the hideousness of the wretched
4216760	4218760	fake trans dump
4218760	4220760	truck. A classic Vanessa
4220760	4222760	thumbnail is divided
4222760	4224760	into two halves. On
4224760	4226760	one half, Vanessa
4226760	4228760	looking fish, looking
4228760	4230760	cunt.
4234760	4236760	Always with her lip gloss in the livestreams.
4236760	4238760	And in the other half of the
4238760	4240760	thumbnail, for contrast,
4240760	4242760	the tragic dump truck
4242760	4244760	in a maladjusted wig.
4244760	4246760	And I'm allowed to say dump truck because before
4246760	4248760	I transitioned, I was one of Vanessa's
4248760	4250760	dump trucks. I was one of
4250760	4252760	her dump trucks.
4252760	4254760	Look, I happen to
4254760	4256760	possess a little thing
4256760	4258760	you probably haven't heard of it, called
4258760	4260760	inner beauty. That's right, sweetie.
4260760	4262760	My pancreas?
4262760	4264760	Unclockable.
4264760	4266760	Meanwhile, Rose,
4266760	4268760	who prefers to represent herself
4268760	4270760	with this cartoon,
4270760	4272760	okay, straight up
4272760	4274760	refers to Yaniv as
4274760	4276760	the tubby troon in the Titanic
4276760	4278760	Tranner of Canada.
4278760	4280760	A particular Titanic Tranner of Canada?
4280760	4282760	Tranner and
4282760	4284760	troon being pejoratives for
4284760	4286760	transgender that I associate
4286760	4288760	with 4chan, where I'm guessing
4288760	4290760	Rose has spent a lot of time.
4292760	4294760	As for the emphatic revulsion
4294760	4296760	toward Yaniv's fatness, well,
4296760	4298760	I'm guessing that must be another
4298760	4300760	important part of stopping a predator, right?
4300760	4302760	It seems almost
4302760	4304760	taboo to condemn people
4304760	4306760	for how rough they look, when
4306760	4308760	I think that that tough love in a
4308760	4310760	way is needed, because
4310760	4312760	I look at what I looked like when I
4312760	4314760	first transitioned, and
4314760	4316760	Jesus Christ, I wish my friends had said something.
4316760	4318760	Like, I looked
4318760	4320760	bad. Like, I was overweight,
4320760	4322760	I had a poor taste
4322760	4324760	in clothes. Like, I was
4324760	4326760	never wearing stupid dresses or anything,
4326760	4328760	it was mostly t-shirts and jeans.
4328760	4330760	You're probably more like this big bullseed
4330760	4332760	barging your way into
4332760	4334760	women's bathrooms, saying
4334760	4336760	this is a woman's body.
4336760	4338760	Now, you might
4338760	4340760	never reach me. You'd see
4340760	4342760	me fake, so in fact, very few of us
4342760	4344760	turn out to look like Claire White. And I want to make
4344760	4346760	it very clear that when I'm talking about
4346760	4348760	transition, I don't mean that
4348760	4350760	you're going to- Rose...
4350760	4352760	Are you okay? No.
4352760	4354760	You're not okay. None of us are okay.
4354760	4356760	No trans woman, remotely
4356760	4358760	in the public eye, is in any way
4358760	4360760	okay. And look, I don't want to take
4360760	4362760	this psychoanalysis too far, because
4362760	4364760	I don't know, from watching YouTube
4364760	4366760	videos, what's going on in someone's head.
4366760	4368760	But I can try to make intelligent inferences,
4368760	4370760	and I think it's pretty revealing
4370760	4372760	that this is how Rose
4372760	4374760	introduces the topic of Jessica
4374760	4376760	Yaniv. Being, well, one of the
4376760	4378760	biggest characters in the
4378760	4380760	whole fucking world at the moment,
4380760	4382760	which is Jessica Yaniv.
4382760	4384760	Rose?
4384760	4386760	Gorge?
4386760	4388760	Jessica Yaniv is not one of
4388760	4390760	the biggest characters
4390760	4392760	in the whole world
4392760	4394760	at any moment. This is not
4394760	4396760	a world historical figure.
4396760	4398760	At the end of the day, this is a more or less
4398760	4400760	random civilian sex fiend off
4400760	4402760	the streets of Vancouver, BC.
4402760	4404760	The only reason anyone has heard of her at all
4404760	4406760	is that Vanessa decided to go full to catch
4406760	4408760	a predator and turn this grimy
4408760	4410760	reprobate into a minor anti-celebrity.
4410760	4412760	She is not one of the most important
4412760	4414760	characters in the world. But it sounds
4414760	4416760	like what she is, Rose, is
4416760	4418760	one of the most important characters
4418760	4420760	in your brain. This is distorted thinking.
4420760	4422760	It's like A-Log comparing
4422760	4424760	Chris Chan to Hitler. You're so deep
4424760	4426760	in the morbid cringe obsession that
4426760	4428760	you've lost perspective. And I'm sure
4428760	4430760	you have what seem to you like perfectly
4430760	4432760	logical reasons why you're devoting so much
4432760	4434760	attention to this. And I know videos
4434760	4436760	about Yaniv get a lot of views, so I'm
4436760	4438760	sure that's a factor too. But Rose,
4438760	4440760	I also know a morbid cringe obsession
4440760	4442760	when I see one. And I know
4442760	4444760	that being a visible trans woman on the
4444760	4446760	internet is more difficult than most
4446760	4448760	people can imagine. And I know
4448760	4450760	that pretty much every trans person is
4450760	4452760	bullied or shamed or humiliated
4452760	4454760	at some point in our lives. And I know
4454760	4456760	how good it can feel to
4456760	4458760	take all the horrible things transphobic
4458760	4460760	noobs and bullies and TERFs have said about
4460760	4462760	us, and repeat them
4462760	4464760	verbatim about some
4464760	4466760	big, fat, fake,
4466760	4468760	dangerous, delusional, disgusting
4468760	4470760	male fetishist. Oh,
4470760	4472760	it feels good to be the TERF for
4472760	4474760	once. It feels good to be the
4474760	4476760	judge rather than the judged.
4476760	4478760	Because when you point the finger at someone else,
4478760	4480760	you're also pointing away
4480760	4482760	from yourself. And it's not
4482760	4484760	lost on me that in conservative circles,
4484760	4486760	queer people are often treated like
4486760	4488760	suspected sex criminals by default.
4488760	4490760	So there's safety in being the
4490760	4492760	one who spearheads the think of the children
4492760	4494760	type moral crusade. And when
4494760	4496760	you expose a trans predator,
4496760	4498760	you get that feeling of
4498760	4500760	safety plus the relief
4500760	4502760	of having someone in particular
4502760	4504760	to blame for the shame
4504760	4506760	and stigma we all feel.
4506760	4508760	Jessica Yaniv is the reason
4508760	4510760	people hate us. But that's just not true.
4510760	4512760	It's a simple answer to a
4512760	4514760	complicated problem. It's scapegoating.
4514760	4516760	When I look at the Yaniv
4516760	4518760	obsession on trans YouTube,
4518760	4520760	I see a community trying
4520760	4522760	to cope with stigma and
4522760	4524760	hoping that destroying a scapegoat
4524760	4526760	will bring relief. It's basically
4526760	4528760	a blood sacrifice.
4528760	4530760	It's not rational. It feels
4530760	4532760	good for a moment,
4532760	4534760	but it's an addiction. It won't ever
4534760	4536760	erase the stigma and the shame.
4536760	4538760	And Yaniv is simply the latest
4538760	4540760	and most deserving in a
4540760	4542760	long line of bad
4542760	4544760	transgenders who aren't real transgenders
4544760	4546760	and are giving us a bad name
4546760	4548760	and are the reason people hate us and
4548760	4550760	want us to be condemned and destroyed.
4550760	4552760	But when Yaniv is finally gone,
4552760	4554760	when you get her sent to prison or whatever your
4554760	4556760	goal is, you're just gonna find a new
4556760	4558760	scapegoat to take her place.
4558760	4560760	And the shame cycle continues.
4560760	4562760	The humiliation and bullying we've experienced
4562760	4564760	is internalized as shame.
4564760	4566760	When we project that shame onto
4566760	4568760	scapegoats and onto each other,
4568760	4570760	it becomes cringing and contempt.
4570760	4572760	And we voice that contempt
4572760	4574760	by shaming other people,
4574760	4576760	which starts a new cycle.
4576760	4578760	So you can keep finding new scapegoats,
4578760	4580760	new punching bags, new shame dumps,
4580760	4582760	new lolcows, and you can end up like
4582760	4584760	one of the people who's been archiving
4584760	4586760	Chris Chan for 13 years.
4586760	4588760	But that will never really heal us.
4588760	4590760	God, how do I get out of this video?
4590760	4592760	I'm trying to have a serious conversation
4592760	4594760	dressed as some sort of catgirl degenerate.
4594760	4596760	Cringe. Shame.
4596760	4598760	I'm ashamed. Don't look at me.
4598760	4600760	You know,
4600760	4602760	I love wearing florals in front of flowers.
4602760	4604760	Thank you, yes.
4604760	4606760	I suppose it is groundbreaking.
4606760	4608760	Alright children, let's review our notes
4608760	4610760	on cringe. The word cringe really describes
4610760	4612760	two different emotions,
4612760	4614760	either embarrassment or contempt.
4614760	4616760	You can feel either one for yourself
4616760	4618760	or for someone else. When you're embarrassed
4618760	4620760	for someone else, we call that vicarious
4620760	4622760	embarrassment. And that can mean cringing
4622760	4624760	with someone who is embarrassed themselves,
4624760	4626760	which I've argued is excluded
4626760	4628760	in the internet usage of the word cringe.
4628760	4630760	Or it can mean embarrassment for someone
4630760	4632760	who isn't embarrassed themselves,
4632760	4634760	in which case we say we're cringing at them.
4634760	4636760	Now if someone who's part of your
4636760	4638760	in-group is embarrassing themselves,
4638760	4640760	by proxy, embarrassing the in-group
4640760	4642760	that includes you, you feel
4642760	4644760	in-group cringe, which can involve
4644760	4646760	both vicarious embarrassment
4646760	4648760	and a kind of self-cringe.
4648760	4650760	And on the contempt side, contempt
4650760	4652760	for someone who shares traits in common with
4652760	4654760	you, particularly if they're traits you have
4654760	4656760	contempt for in yourself, can
4656760	4658760	develop into morbid cringe,
4658760	4660760	which is that obsession with a lol cow,
4660760	4662760	that addiction to contemptuous
4662760	4664760	gazing at a dark mirror in which
4664760	4666760	you see reflected everything you hate about
4666760	4668760	yourself or about your in-group.
4668760	4670760	Now I want to end this video by reflecting
4670760	4672760	on whether cringe is good or bad,
4672760	4674760	healthy or harmful.
4674760	4676760	And I do think that in some situations,
4676760	4678760	cringe is good.
4678760	4680760	Embarrassment serves a social purpose.
4680760	4682760	It helps us interact smoothly with each other
4682760	4684760	by telling us what not to do.
4684760	4686760	And empathizing with other people's embarrassing
4686760	4688760	stories can be cathartic.
4688760	4690760	It can make you feel closer to other people,
4690760	4692760	more alike, less alone.
4692760	4694760	I also think a moderate amount of self-cringe
4694760	4696760	is very healthy. It shows you're
4696760	4698760	self-aware, and you care at least
4698760	4700760	a little bit what other people think.
4700760	4702760	You know, I've met people who never cringe
4702760	4704760	at themselves, and let's just say
4704760	4706760	they're not my kind of people.
4706760	4708760	They're narcissists who think super highly
4708760	4710760	of themselves, regardless of how they're
4710760	4712760	actually coming across. But I think partly
4712760	4714760	out of fear of ending up like one of those
4714760	4716760	people, I've overcompensated.
4716760	4718760	And I cringe too much.
4718760	4720760	Both at myself, and at other people.
4720760	4722760	It's a habit that's kind of
4722760	4724760	making me hate myself, and it's making
4724760	4726760	me unfairly contemptuous towards
4726760	4728760	others. And when I take a look around the
4728760	4730760	internet, like I've done in this video,
4730760	4732760	I find that I'm not
4732760	4734760	alone in this situation. And it's
4734760	4736760	not cute. So, how do we
4736760	4738760	cringe less? Well, the cliche solution
4738760	4740760	is self-love, which our culture
4740760	4742760	places a lot of value on.
4742760	4744760	Self-love and self-esteem.
4744760	4746760	You know, I don't care what haters
4746760	4748760	and losers say. I'm a bad bitch.
4748760	4750760	I look like a supermodel.
4750760	4752760	I'm a genius.
4752760	4754760	We're encouraged to hype ourselves up in this way.
4754760	4756760	But it doesn't work, because it's not
4756760	4758760	realistic. You don't look like a supermodel.
4758760	4760760	And you're not a genius.
4760760	4762760	And when you realize that, you fall from one
4762760	4764760	extreme to the other of what Chris Fleming calls
4764760	4766760	the self-esteem tower of terror.
4766760	4768760	You go from self-love to self-hate.
4768760	4770760	But self-hate is also
4770760	4772760	a distortion. Recently I was listening to
4772760	4774760	a David Foster Wallace interview.
4774760	4776760	Yeah, I know. Cringe. And he attacked
4776760	4778760	me mercilessly and unprovoked.
4778760	4780760	There's a lot of narcissism and self-hatred.
4780760	4782760	How
4782760	4784760	dare you notice that? I'm in this
4784760	4786760	photo and I don't like it.
4786760	4788760	But it's true! Time spent
4788760	4790760	cringing at yourself is still
4790760	4792760	time spent obsessing over yourself.
4792760	4794760	And it's hard not to, because
4794760	4796760	humans are animals, so our
4796760	4798760	perspective is egocentric by nature.
4798760	4800760	But we can still learn to appreciate
4800760	4802760	that the world is bigger
4802760	4804760	than us. I mean, I've heard rumors.
4804760	4806760	In that book we started with, Cringeworthy,
4806760	4808760	Melissa Doll advocates not
4808760	4810760	self-love or self-hate, but what
4810760	4812760	she calls self-indifference.
4812760	4814760	She says,
4814760	4816760	Self-indifference is the relief
4816760	4818760	of realizing that you are simply
4818760	4820760	not that big a deal.
4820760	4822760	So yeah, I was pretty
4822760	4824760	cringey in the past, and
4824760	4826760	I'm still pretty cringey now, but
4826760	4828760	you know what? Everyone else
4828760	4830760	is pretty cringey too. And the world's
4830760	4832760	probably gonna burn down in 50 years anyway,
4832760	4834760	so I don't know if I would call this
4834760	4836760	good news, but if it's
4836760	4838760	any consolation, uh,
4838760	4840760	nothing matters.
4840760	4842760	Nothing matters.
4842760	4844760	Nothing matters.
4844760	4846760	Nothing matters.
4846760	4848760	Nothing matters.
4848760	4850760	Nothing matters.
4850760	4852760	Nothing matters.
4852760	4854760	Nothing matters.
4854760	4856760	Nothing matters.
4856760	4858760	Nothing matters.
4858760	4860760	Nothing matters.
4860760	4862760	Nothing matters.
