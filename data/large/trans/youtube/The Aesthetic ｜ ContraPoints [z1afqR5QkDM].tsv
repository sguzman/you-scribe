0	6000	In color theory, the selection of colors used in a design is called a color scheme.
6000	11000	Analogous color schemes use the main color plus one or more adjacent colors,
11000	15000	while complementary schemes use any two colors directly opposite on the color wheel.
18000	22000	Hi girls! I'm Tracy Mounts, guest host of ContraPoints,
22000	27000	the internet show where we talk about sadness, fascism, sexual deviation, cults.
27000	31000	This week, we'll be talking about colors.
31000	34000	Colors! What the fuck are they?
34000	37000	In one beaker I have white, in the other, brown.
37000	41000	Pour them together, and wow, I don't know what the kids are calling it.
41000	43000	It's delicious!
43000	45000	Now according to some so-called experts,
45000	48000	color is really different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation.
48000	50000	But what about the shadow illusion?
50000	52000	Same wavelengths, different colors.
52000	54000	Some people say I'm a man dressed as a lady,
54000	57000	but I'm actually a lady who used colors
57000	60000	to be a man dressed as a man dressed as a lady.
60000	62000	Explain that, Professor Butler.
62000	63000	Illusion.
63000	67000	What matters more, the way things are or the way things look?
67000	70000	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
82000	86000	Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, um...
87000	90000	It's too early for this.
90000	92000	Today, my guests are, um...
96000	98000	Well, who are you people?
98000	101000	I'm Dr. Abigail Cockbane,
101000	105000	Associate Professor of Women's Studies and author of many, many books.
105000	108000	Most recently, my doctoral thesis,
108000	111000	Sacred Passage, The Divine Feminine in Flux and Flow.
111000	113000	Oh, yes.
113000	115000	And, uh...
115000	117000	Well, you look familiar. Who are you?
117000	120000	Um...
126000	128000	Okay, well...
128000	131000	Today, my guests will be debating the topic...
131000	133000	Um...
133000	134000	Well, here's a good one.
134000	138000	Should it be illegal to use the wrong pronouns for a transgender?
138000	139000	What do you think, Annabelle?
139000	143000	Well, Jackie, liberation from the oppressive institution of gender
143000	145000	begins with freedom of speech.
145000	148000	For instance, this cat person over here
148000	152000	is clearly a biological male in some sort of costume wig.
152000	156000	Now, I of course support his right to dress however he wishes,
156000	158000	but the fact remains that pronouns refer,
158000	161000	as they always have referred, to chromosomal sex.
161000	163000	But perhaps you disagree, sir.
166000	167000	That's a human rights violation!
167000	169000	I'll smash your fucking face!
170000	172000	And here we have a clear illustration
172000	174000	of the way that transgender ideology
174000	177000	is merely a smokescreen for male violence against women.
177000	179000	And mind you, this is being taught in our schools,
179000	181000	it's being forced on our children,
181000	182000	it's becoming mandatory...
182000	184000	Security! Have this cat removed!
184000	185000	The centers are being silenced,
185000	188000	and something must be done about the encroaching trans agenda
188000	190000	taking away women's rights,
190000	191000	invading women's spaces,
191000	194000	depriving us of what feminism has worked so hard to...
196000	197000	I love a kitty queen,
197000	199000	but Abigail clocks a cat.
199000	201000	Gender's just like color.
201000	202000	Some people see yellow,
202000	203000	some people see blue.
203000	205000	It's all a matter of opinion.
205000	206000	Or is it?
206000	207000	It's not.
207000	209000	Let's hear the real tea.
223000	224000	Tabby.
224000	225000	Sweetie.
225000	226000	Baby.
226000	227000	Princess.
227000	229000	I feel ridiculous in this dress.
229000	231000	Yeah, well you look ridiculous,
231000	233000	because you wouldn't take the goddamn cat of yours,
233000	234000	off.
234000	235000	I think I'm gonna take the dress off.
235000	236000	Well, don't do that.
236000	238000	I'm trying to help you out, girl.
238000	239000	If you don't want to get misgendered,
239000	241000	it helps to femme it up a little.
241000	243000	I'm gonna take it off.
243000	244000	Well, don't leave.
244000	245000	You can change in front of me.
245000	246000	I'm not a prude.
246000	248000	I'm gonna go behind the curtain.
250000	252000	I like looking at naked people.
253000	254000	Why do you always hit on me?
254000	255000	I thought you were into men.
255000	257000	Well, I swing both ways.
257000	259000	I like boy dick and girl dick.
259000	261000	That's not how that works.
261000	262000	I hate that.
262000	263000	The heart wants what it wants.
263000	265000	Why did you invite me over here anyway?
265000	267000	I saw what happened to you on the Freedom Report,
267000	268000	and girl,
268000	269000	girl,
269000	270000	you cannot be
270000	272000	a trans woman on TV
272000	273000	threatening people with a bat.
273000	276000	You think it's morally wrong to stand up to your oppressors?
276000	278000	No, morally wrong.
278000	279000	What does that even mean?
279000	281000	It was much worse than morally wrong.
281000	282000	It was aesthetically wrong.
282000	284000	It was unfeminine.
284000	285000	This is all you ever say to me.
285000	286000	It's bad optics.
286000	287000	It's bad aesthetics.
287000	289000	Well, does reality matter at all to you?
289000	291000	Because the reality is I am a woman,
291000	293000	and maybe a bunch of ignorant people don't think I look like one,
293000	295000	but the way things look isn't all that matters.
295000	297000	Tabby, this is politics.
297000	300000	Have you ever had a conversation with the average voter?
300000	302000	Reality plays no role in politics.
302000	304000	Politics is aesthetics.
304000	306000	Politics is aesthetics?
306000	308000	That's literally what fascism is.
308000	310000	Have you even read Benjamin?
310000	311000	Ugh.
311000	314000	Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life.
314000	316000	The military parades, the pageantry,
316000	319000	and communism responds by politicizing art.
319000	321000	This is what I can't stand about communists.
321000	323000	You want to turn art into propaganda.
323000	325000	Well, art is already ideology.
325000	326000	Ugh.
326000	327000	Look, instead of ruining art,
327000	332000	why don't we fight the pageantry of fascism with pageantry of our own?
332000	334000	And you know who's gonna make that happen?
334000	335000	Who?
335000	337000	Well-funded trans women.
337000	339000	Patreon's in the description.
339000	340000	Ew. Stop that.
340000	341000	What?
341000	343000	I'm just trying to monetize a connected engagement community
343000	347000	by strategically leveraging my content creator promotional media brand analytics.
347000	348000	Is that so wrong?
348000	350000	You're so bougie.
350000	352000	I'm not the one quoting German philosophers from memory.
352000	354000	Revolutionary philosophers.
354000	356000	Whatever you need to tell yourself.
356000	359000	Look, the point I'm trying to make is that the world we live in
359000	361000	is not a philosophical world.
361000	362000	Think about Instagram.
362000	365000	It's all about transforming your life into an enviable spectacle.
365000	368000	If you cry yourself to sleep every night, who cares?
368000	369000	No one sees that.
369000	370000	They only see the show you're putting on.
370000	372000	Okay, but life is not a show.
372000	374000	Mmm, politics is a show.
374000	375000	Look around you, Tabby.
375000	377000	Try to understand what's happening to the world.
377000	381000	The president of the United States is a reality TV star.
381000	384000	The 21st century is an aesthetic century.
384000	387000	In history, there are ages of reason and there are ages of spectacle.
387000	389000	And it's important to know which you're in.
389000	393000	Our America, our internet, is not ancient Athens.
393000	394000	It's Rome.
394000	396000	And your problem is you think you're in the forum
396000	398000	when you're really in the circus.
398000	401000	I thought you were just criticizing me for being violent.
401000	403000	Now you're against reason, too?
403000	404000	I'm not against reason.
404000	406000	Reason is a very powerful aesthetic.
406000	408000	If you're a man.
408000	409000	And what if you're a woman?
409000	410000	Oh, don't be a woman.
410000	412000	That's not a good idea.
412000	413000	Ow.
413000	416000	Do you remember that debate between Blair White and that YouTuber with the pink wig?
416000	418000	What was her name?
418000	419000	I don't know.
419000	421000	She was relevant back in 2017.
421000	423000	Anyway, this was before she transitioned.
423000	426000	And in that debate, Blair looked like she had two X chromosomes.
426000	430000	And the other one looked like this awkward dude in an anime wig not looking at the camera.
430000	432000	I vaguely remember.
432000	434000	I think I wrote an angry blog post about it.
434000	436000	Well, the pink wig lost that debate so badly.
436000	438000	It was embarrassing to watch.
438000	439000	Not really.
439000	440000	I mean, she was right.
440000	441000	And her arguments were better.
441000	444000	Ah, Tabby.
444000	445000	Sweetie.
445000	446000	Honey.
446000	447000	Angel.
447000	448000	Darling.
448000	449000	Princess.
449000	450000	Baby.
450000	451000	Arguments don't matter.
451000	452000	How pretty you are matters.
452000	454000	Is this really where you're going with this?
454000	459000	Tabby, if you want to be a public figure, sooner or later you're gonna need to take the trans girl black pill.
459000	460000	Oh boy.
460000	464000	If you're a trans woman in the public eye, what matters is one thing and one thing only.
464000	466000	And it's always been the thing that matters.
466000	467000	What?
467000	468000	The realness.
468000	471000	Verisimilitude.
471000	473000	You have to look like a fucking woman.
473000	474000	There it is.
474000	475000	There it is is right.
475000	478000	We don't say it in public, but we all know it and we all feel it.
478000	480000	What does it even mean to look like a woman?
480000	482000	Oh, don't give me that PC bullshit.
482000	484000	I'm trying to have a real conversation here.
484000	485000	We all know what it means.
485000	487000	I don't know what it means.
487000	488000	Women have a lot of different looks.
488000	492000	There are bald women, bearded women, muscular women, wide-shouldered women.
492000	494000	And what is society's opinion about those bald, bearded, wide-shouldered women?
494000	499000	Is this just about you making me wear the dress again?
499000	501000	The dress is the last of my concerns.
501000	503000	I mean, where do I even start with this?
503000	505000	You're wearing combat boots.
505000	507000	You cannot be wearing combat boots.
507000	508000	Why not?
508000	509000	A lot of cis women wear them.
509000	510000	Cis women?
510000	512000	Well, they're hopeless, aren't they?
512000	513000	Fully clockable.
513000	516000	So you want me to look like a woman without imitating cis women?
516000	517000	Yes.
517000	519000	Do not under any circumstances imitate cis women.
519000	521000	They have no idea what they're doing.
521000	523000	Well, where does your idea of womanhood even come from then?
523000	526000	Das ewige Weibliche.
526000	528000	The archetype of the eternal feminine.
528000	530000	And where does that come from?
530000	532000	Poets.
532000	534000	Teenage gay boys on Instagram.
534000	537000	The only people with any coherent vision of contemporary womanhood.
537000	538000	That's insanity.
538000	539000	Is it?
539000	541000	Tabby, look at my face.
541000	543000	Look at this highlight.
543000	546000	Does that look like the product of insanity to you?
546000	548000	I mean, yeah, kind of.
548000	551000	Who puts on that much makeup to drink tea at home?
551000	552000	Good banter.
552000	553000	Well done.
553000	555000	Trans women have to overdo it.
555000	559000	You need to be so good at makeup that every cis woman you know comes to you for advice.
559000	562000	You need to toss your hair and cross your legs.
562000	565000	You need to smile even at people who hate you.
565000	567000	Eliminate every aggressive impulse.
567000	571000	You must be a blossom floating along the surface of a stream.
571000	574000	Your hands are not tools.
574000	577000	They're ornaments at the ends of your arms.
577000	580000	So you literally are what TERFs think trans women are.
580000	582000	Literally a man's idea of a woman.
582000	584000	Well, men have the power.
584000	585000	Men make the rules.
585000	588000	And it's ultimately men who are the judges of womanhood.
588000	591000	So you can't really blame me for having to deal with that situation.
591000	596000	I can blame you for dealing with it by demanding we all conform to a bunch of ridiculous stereotypes.
596000	597000	Not stereotypes.
597000	598000	Performances.
598000	601000	You like philosophy so much, haven't you read Judith Butler?
601000	603000	Gender is performance.
603000	606000	We're all born naked and the rest is literally drag.
606000	608000	Womanhood is not what you are.
608000	609000	It's what you do.
609000	611000	And trans women have to be virtuosas of womanhood.
611000	616000	So according to you, there's no difference between a trans woman and a drag queen.
616000	618000	Now, you're misinterpreting what I'm saying.
618000	621000	I don't mean performance in the sense of pretending to be something you're not.
621000	624000	I mean performance in the sense of everything you do.
624000	626000	The way you style yourself.
626000	627000	Your posture.
627000	628000	The way you speak.
628000	631000	An authentic performance is just a habitual performance.
631000	633000	And nothing more than that.
633000	637000	So, trans women just starting their transition are pretending to be women?
637000	640000	I mean, isn't that kind of what it felt like?
641000	643000	You transition the same way you get anywhere in life.
643000	645000	You fake it till you make it.
645000	648000	So according to you, a trans woman is just a full-time drag queen.
648000	649000	That's what any woman is.
649000	651000	What about gender non-conforming cis women?
651000	653000	They're not doing womanhood in that way.
653000	654000	Well, yeah.
654000	656000	That's why those women are marginalized.
656000	660000	They're going off the grid of what society recognizes as womanhood.
660000	662000	And you don't want to end up like that, do you?
662000	663000	And hold on.
663000	668000	Are you saying that if a cis man dresses like a woman, talks like a woman, takes female hormones,
668000	670000	is gendered female by other people,
670000	673000	and spends his whole life pretending to be a trans woman,
673000	676000	that he's literally as much of a woman as we are?
676000	677000	Yep.
677000	678000	That's absurd.
678000	680000	But it's absurd because the example is absurd.
680000	682000	No cis man would do that.
682000	685000	It's like asking, is a straight man gay if he only sleeps with men?
685000	687000	Like, yeah, pretty much.
687000	689000	See, this is a philosophy at its worst.
689000	691000	Pointless speculative fiction.
691000	694000	And it's a distraction from what we're really talking about,
694000	696000	which is you getting rid of those combat boots.
696000	698000	I thought we were talking about philosophy.
698000	699000	No.
699000	700000	We're talking about shoes.
700000	702000	Why do I always have to justify what I wear to you?
702000	706000	You're apparently fine wearing designer dresses around your communist friends.
706000	710000	The left will abide a regal queer.
711000	715000	Look, your performance theory doesn't explain why trans people exist in the first place.
715000	717000	If gender is just a bunch of learned behaviors,
717000	720000	then why did we reject our male upbringing and decide to live as women?
720000	723000	What matters is that we identify as women.
723000	725000	We can express that identity in different ways,
725000	729000	but it's the identity, not the performance, that makes us women.
729000	732000	But you can't be a woman without performing womanhood.
732000	736000	Without action, and without social recognition, the identity is meaningless.
736000	739000	If womanhood is nothing to you but a private daydream,
739000	742000	then you may as well do what those assholes say and identify as a helicopter,
742000	746000	because unless you're living womanhood, the identity is literally that meaningless.
746000	749000	That's very unfair to pre-transition trans people.
749000	753000	Well, this isn't a Tumblr cuddle party, girl, I'm trying to talk about what's really true.
753000	756000	I didn't say it was insensitive, I said it was unfair.
756000	758000	Identifying as a woman before you transition
758000	763000	is a psychological reality that implies a potential to live your inner truth.
763000	767000	No one has ever sincerely identified as a helicopter, it's just a troll example.
767000	771000	True, but even if they were sincere, there would still be no reality to it,
771000	774000	because helicopter is not an actual social role.
774000	778000	Whereas, you can become a teacher, a doctor, or a woman,
778000	782000	but you have to work to get there, and ultimately, society has to let you.
782000	783000	What do you mean?
783000	787000	I can identify as a doctor and go around handing out diagnoses,
787000	792000	but if no one recognizes me as a doctor, then I'm not really practicing medicine, am I?
792000	795000	But that analogy means that our womanhood can be revoked at any moment.
795000	797000	All it takes is being misgendered.
797000	800000	It's scary, but isn't that the situation we're in?
800000	803000	Why did you get so angry when that TERF called you sir?
803000	807000	Isn't it because, in that situation, she robbed you of your womanhood?
807000	810000	That's ridiculous. I am a woman. That's my reality.
810000	812000	It doesn't depend on other people's opinions.
812000	816000	I know you're a woman, I'm just saying that in that one moment,
816000	818000	you effectively had your gender cancelled.
818000	822000	Another way of looking at it is, gender is aesthetic, not rational.
822000	825000	Either you're perceived as a woman or you aren't.
825000	827000	There's no reasoning your way into it.
827000	829000	Oh, don't worry about that. I don't argue I'm a woman.
829000	830000	I smash.
830000	833000	I know you do. And it's a bad look.
833000	835000	Is this about the shoes again?
835000	837000	Yep. Here, put these on.
837000	839000	Absolutely not. I'm not wearing those.
839000	841000	Yes you are, bitch.
841000	842000	Nope.
842000	844000	If you put these on, I'll, um,
844000	846000	scratch you behind the ears,
846000	847000	years later.
847000	849000	Okay, fine.
849000	851000	Now walk.
851000	853000	Ugh.
871000	873000	That was the worst thing I've ever seen.
873000	875000	Well, you're the one who made me do it.
875000	877000	Look, don't stomp around like that.
877000	879000	Keep your shoulders back and steady.
879000	881000	All the movement comes from your hips.
881000	883000	And you want to put the weight on the balls of your feet.
883000	885000	Here, I'll show you.
905000	913000	Your turn. Do it right.
913000	915000	The category is...
915000	917000	Catgirls.
933000	934000	Yes, bitch!
934000	936000	That was flawless. It was iconic.
936000	938000	I'm living for this. I'm loving this for you.
938000	940000	You're doing so good for yourself.
940000	942000	Ugh, I'm never doing that again.
942000	944000	Ugh! Why not?
944000	945000	Because it's not who I am.
945000	947000	All your advice is just trying to turn me into you.
947000	949000	Well, that's not what aesthetics is.
949000	952000	Aesthetics is the expression of an inner truth.
952000	954000	And I'll only ever be a second-rate Justine.
954000	956000	But I can be a first-rate Tabby.
956000	959000	Well, kids, this week we learned a valuable lesson
959000	961000	about the importance of being yourself.
961000	962000	Shut up!
962000	963000	Look, I know I'm not cool, okay?
963000	965000	I know I'm not pretty.
965000	967000	And I know you think you're too good for me
967000	968000	because you mostly pass.
968000	971000	And I know you and your friends laugh at me behind my back.
971000	973000	People stare at me because I'm a transgender furry,
973000	974000	and that's weird.
974000	976000	But I'm a fucking queer icon
976000	977000	because I'm not like you.
977000	979000	Because I'm not like anyone but myself.
979000	982000	And because I'm willing to stand up to the people who oppress us.
982000	984000	And I'm willing to stand up for the girls with beard shadow
984000	985000	and deep voices
985000	987000	that girls even other trans women make fun of.
987000	989000	And when in the history of the world
989000	992000	has anyone but me ever stood up for them?
992000	993000	That's why I'm here.
993000	995000	Everyone knows who Tabby is.
995000	998000	When was the last time anyone talked about Justine?
998000	1001000	Wow, Tabby, I didn't know you had that in you.
1001000	1002000	But so what?
1002000	1004000	So male-to-anime Twitter stans you.
1004000	1005000	Big deal.
1005000	1006000	You're mad, aren't you?
1006000	1008000	I'll get over it in a few weeks.
1008000	1010000	Look, you're right.
1010000	1011000	You have to be yourself.
1011000	1013000	Trying to be someone else is always a bad look.
1013000	1017000	So I guess if combat boots are your aesthetic,
1017000	1019000	then wear them well and make it work.
1019000	1021000	But sometimes being yourself is not enough.
1021000	1023000	Sometimes you have to become
1023000	1024000	yourself.
1024000	1025000	And for you,
1025000	1028000	I think that means that the smashing has got to stop.
1028000	1030000	I mean, with the Nazis it's one thing,
1030000	1032000	but you cannot be menacing radical feminists with a bat.
1032000	1034000	I wouldn't have to smash if literally anyone else
1034000	1036000	were willing to stick up for us.
1036000	1038000	Your delicate notion of femininity
1038000	1040000	is a product of the privilege you share
1040000	1042000	with a lot of thin white cis feminists.
1042000	1043000	Wow.
1043000	1045000	It must be so hard for you out on the streets
1045000	1046000	as a fat woman of color.
1046000	1047000	Shut up.
1047000	1048000	I'm just saying,
1048000	1050000	don't claim a struggle that isn't yours, girl.
1050000	1051000	You could have what I have,
1051000	1052000	you just have to work for it
1052000	1055000	instead of playing this part of the tragic victim.
1055000	1056000	You were raised a white boy.
1056000	1059000	You got to go to college and learn all that philosophy.
1059000	1060000	And yeah,
1060000	1062000	it's hard being a trans woman of any background,
1062000	1064000	but you still stand on a lot of privilege.
1064000	1065000	I look at all the photos of trans women
1065000	1067000	who are murdered in this country,
1067000	1069000	and they don't look like you or me.
1069000	1070000	Why don't you use your privilege
1070000	1071000	and use your education
1071000	1073000	to actually do some good in the world
1073000	1075000	instead of this elective, revolutionary LARPing?
1075000	1077000	You make me sound like the self-indulgent one.
1077000	1079000	I'm sorry I'm not hardworking enough
1079000	1081000	to go to brunch dates and cocktail parties
1081000	1082000	with transphobes.
1082000	1084000	I've seen minds change
1084000	1086000	and hearts soften before my eyes.
1086000	1088000	You don't win friends and allies with a bat.
1088000	1089000	They're just using you.
1089000	1091000	Well, who do you think benefits?
1091000	1092000	And who do you think gets hurt
1092000	1093000	when you go out into the world
1093000	1096000	and represent trans women as masculine and violent?
1096000	1097000	Who do you think benefits
1097000	1098000	when they trot you out
1098000	1100000	to be feminine and meek and acquiescent?
1100000	1102000	I guess we can't win, can we?
1102000	1103000	You want to just chill out
1103000	1105000	and watch YouTube videos?
1105000	1106000	Yeah, okay.
1108000	1109000	Forget about the disrespect.
1109000	1110000	Facts don't care about your feelings.
1110000	1111000	It turns out
1111000	1112000	that every chromosome,
1112000	1114000	every cell in Caitlyn Jenner's body
1114000	1115000	is male with the exception
1115000	1117000	of some of his sperm cells.
1117000	1119000	You don't know what you're talking about.
1119000	1120000	You're not educated on genetics.
1120000	1122000	Would you actually like to discuss the genetics?
1122000	1123000	What are your genetics?
1123000	1125000	You cut that out now
1125000	1127000	or you'll go home in an ambulance.
1127000	1129000	Yeah, that seems mildly inappropriate
1129000	1130000	for a political discussion.
1130000	1132000	You cut that out now
1132000	1135000	or you'll go home in an ambulance.
1135000	1136000	So I look at that
1136000	1137000	and I feel like on my end
1137000	1138000	it's like I'm always,
1138000	1140000	I feel like I'm always damage controlling
1140000	1141000	for the trans community,
1141000	1142000	which is so frustrating.
1142000	1143000	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1143000	1144000	Damage controlling.
1144000	1145000	So frustrating.
1145000	1146000	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1146000	1147000	Facts don't care about your feelings.
1147000	1148000	So frustrating.
1148000	1149000	You'll go home in an ambulance.
1149000	1150000	It's imperative
1150000	1151000	that we actually use terms
1151000	1152000	that refer to something.
1152000	1153000	If you want to talk about
1153000	1155000	gender as distinct from sex
1155000	1156000	and then talk about
1156000	1158000	you're a very feminine biological man,
1158000	1159000	you know,
1159000	1161000	and you've had surgeries to prove it,
1161000	1163000	then I think that we can talk about
1163000	1164000	what is the appropriate pronoun to use.
1164000	1166000	My problem is the...
1169000	1170000	Tabby, I don't want to fight with you.
1171000	1173000	We're surviving in this shit world together
1173000	1175000	and you'll always be my sister.
1175000	1177000	Well, I'm glad.
1177000	1178000	I love you.
1178000	1179000	What?
1179000	1180000	Love.
1180000	1181000	I was in love once.
1181000	1183000	I was in a smoky roadhouse
1183000	1184000	outside Cincinnati
1184000	1186000	bent over a pool table.
1186000	1188000	The year was 1985.
1188000	1189000	And to this day,
1189000	1191000	when the perfume of cheap whiskey
1191000	1192000	hits my nostrils
1192000	1194000	at just the right moment,
1194000	1195000	I can almost feel
1195000	1197000	the beer-stained billiard cloth
1197000	1199000	against my cheek.
1199000	1201000	Let's watch it all on VHS
1201000	1203000	cassette to learn more.
1231000	1234000	If tonight is the night
1234000	1238000	that I'm going to dance
1242000	1244000	While the lasers are high
1244000	1246000	in our visions of love
1250000	1252000	As we reach for the sky
1252000	1254000	this is all that we know
1261000	1262000	I don't remember a single lie
1262000	1263000	without it.
1263000	1264000	But for this song
1264000	1286000	I admit there is only one
