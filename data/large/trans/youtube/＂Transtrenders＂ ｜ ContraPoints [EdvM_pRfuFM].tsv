0	24560	Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital messiah, the online oracle, the social media savior, yea, verily I say unto you, there are influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night.
24560	32220	And lo, I came upon them, and the glory of my posts shone about me, and I delivered unto them a vision.
43060	45820	Freedom, freedom, fucking freedom.
46380	52760	Which matters more, the freedom to live an authentic life, or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel of a jackboot?
52760	54540	As a centrist, I am unbiased.
54560	58080	Undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it.
58400	65560	Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss important issues like Mexicans.
65900	66980	How dangerous are they?
67240	69240	Muslims, can we stop them?
69440	77760	Tonight we return, once again, to the dangerous transgender trend that is turning your children into all manner of half-and-halfs and in-betweens.
77760	83780	I mean, look at this, they're transing 13-year-olds now, what's next, babies with breast implants?
83780	85780	It makes me want to throw up.
85780	90580	I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.
90580	92160	Cut the music!
92160	97900	Tonight, my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and conservative opinion-haver.
97900	99900	And my second guest...
99900	106960	Well, what the hell are you? You're transgender, you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's your deal?
106960	113120	Well, Jackie Jackson, my, as you say, deal, is I don't like society.
113120	116120	Forcing me into tiny little boxes.
116120	119120	Okay, but are you a man or a woman? Just tell me.
119120	123120	Well, why does it matter? Why do you have to know?
123120	131120	Maybe you should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these little categories, Jackie Jackson.
131120	137120	Well, can I at least ask your name, or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?
137120	139120	My name is Baltimore.
139120	140620	Baltimore what?
140620	142620	Baltimore, Maryland.
143120	146120	I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore, Maryland?
146120	149120	It is among my names.
149120	151120	Tiffany, what do you make of this?
151120	154120	Look, Jackie, I'm going to be completely real with you.
154120	156120	I am a transsexual.
156120	160120	That means I have a very specific mental disorder called gender dysphoria.
160120	164120	I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance in the womb.
164120	172120	This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function.
172120	174120	It is not a fashion statement.
174120	175120	It is not a trend.
175120	177120	It is not an easy way to feel special and oppressed.
177120	180120	It is a very difficult condition to live with.
183120	185120	I'm dying inside.
185120	188120	Okay, so you're both transsexuals then.
188120	190120	No, I am a transsexual.
190120	192120	That is not a transsexual.
192120	194120	That is a trans-trender.
194120	197120	Trans-trender? What is that? Is that a gender?
197120	198120	No, it's not a gender.
198120	201120	A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here,
201120	210120	who puts on a dress and puts glitter on his beard and goes around telling people he's transgender and complaining about misgendering for oppression points.
210120	212120	Actually, it's they.
212120	213120	What?
213120	214120	I use they-them pronouns.
214120	218120	They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see.
218120	220120	Why do you say that, Tiffany Tumbles?
220120	224120	Have I complained about oppression so far?
224120	229120	It seems to me that it is you who has been complaining about your dysphoria.
229120	230120	Isn't it you?
230120	235120	Is it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?
235120	237120	No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed.
237120	241120	I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.
241120	242120	It's in my brain.
242120	244120	I was diagnosed.
244120	245120	It's a fact.
245120	246120	It's real.
246120	248120	My pain is real.
248120	250120	And my pain isn't real?
250120	253120	It's interesting that you think that.
253120	255120	Well, what pain are you talking about?
255120	258120	People making fun of you because you dress like a circus act?
258120	260120	Interesting that you mentioned the circus.
260120	268120	Tiffany Tumbles, don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the circus?
268120	270120	You're not confined anywhere.
270120	272120	You choose to dress like that.
272120	275120	And why do you choose to dress the way you dress?
275120	278120	Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman.
278120	279120	Hello.
279120	283120	And I'm non-binary, so I dress non-conforming.
283120	288120	Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?
288120	290120	Well, it's a free country.
290120	293120	If you want to be a glitterbeard genderfuck, then go ahead.
293120	299120	But don't go around telling people that you're transgender because it makes us all look like a bunch of trendy freaks.
299120	303120	But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society?
303120	308120	Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity?
308120	312120	Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles.
312120	316120	That is simply adding another cell to the prison.
316120	317120	It's not about conforming.
317120	320120	It's about me having an actual medical condition.
320120	323120	You do not have a female brain.
323120	325120	You have a fashion disaster.
325120	326120	Oh, do they?
326120	329120	Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles.
329120	334120	When the doctor prescribed your hormones, did he take a look at your brain then?
334120	335120	What?
335120	336120	Of course not.
336120	340120	But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?
340120	342120	Well, no.
342120	343120	Where are you going with this?
343120	346120	I mean, if you've never seen your brain,
346120	350120	and the doctor who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it,
350120	353120	then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,
353120	358120	how do you know that you have a female brain?
362120	363120	Bullshit.
363120	364120	That's a good point.
364120	365120	No, it isn't.
365120	366120	Look, there's scientific studies thatâ€”
366120	372120	Can you explain to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain?
372120	374120	Are they different colors?
374120	375120	I'm not an expert.
375120	376120	I'm not an expert.
376120	379120	But there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.
379120	380120	I see.
380120	383120	But your doctor never looked at your brain.
383120	387120	So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?
387120	390120	Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it.
390120	394120	And you told him what exactly?
394120	396120	That I experience gender dysphoria.
396120	399120	So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,
399120	401120	and therefore your identity,
401120	403120	is valid not because of any observed factors,
403120	406120	not because of any observed facts about your brain,
406120	413120	but because of your feelings?
413120	415120	Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter.
415120	417120	You backed me into a corner.
417120	419120	Sure, it's because of my feelings.
419120	421120	My feelings of gender dysphoria.
421120	424120	So tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,
424120	429120	why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid,
429120	432120	but mine, according to you, are not?
433120	436120	This burgeoning brick.
436120	438120	You guys, let's think about this.
438120	441120	If I have never seen my brain,
442120	444120	how do I know I even have a brain?
444120	446120	Well, you probably don't, girl.
446120	450120	Look, Baltimore, I'm sure you have lots of feelings about your gender.
450120	454120	And if you feel cloud gender or demi-nebula or astroglide
454120	457120	or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind,
457120	459120	then you do you, girl.
459120	462120	Or, not girl, whatever the fuck you are.
462120	464120	But I want to make one thing very clear.
464120	468120	I am nothing like you, okay?
468120	470120	My gender is not unicorns and glitter.
470120	473120	My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis
473120	475120	that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.
476120	477120	No, not even you.
477120	481120	My, I'm really getting under your skin, aren't I?
481120	482120	No.
482120	485120	Well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are.
485120	488120	You're getting under my skin because it really rattles my dysphoria
488120	491120	that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender community,
491120	495120	when in fact, you're just making a mockery of my pain.
495120	497120	Your pain?
497120	501120	You're in a lot of pain, aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles?
501120	505120	Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.
505120	508120	And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles.
508120	511120	I pity you because you don't think you're real
511120	515120	until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad.
515120	518120	And I can't imagine what it must be like
518120	520120	to have so little confidence
520120	522120	in your own reality.
522120	524120	Okay, well, don't patronize me.
524120	527120	I'm just trying to understand, Tiffany Tumbles,
527120	531120	why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself
531120	533120	and hating your body.
533120	537120	Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory?
537120	539120	No, you don't have to hate yourself or hate your body,
539120	541120	but you do have to have dysphoria.
541120	544120	And if you tell people otherwise, you're just misleading them.
544120	549120	I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles.
549120	551120	Would you please join me
551120	553120	in saying a prayer for your wellness?
553120	555120	Actually, I would strongly prefer
555120	557120	if you would stay away from any of my rifts.
557120	559120	Oh, goddess of light,
559120	561120	please shield and protect Tiffany
561120	563120	against the ravages of inner strife.
563120	565120	Enclose her in your loving arms
565120	568120	and cleanse her of all condemnation
568120	570120	and internalized transphobia.
570120	572120	I entreat you, oh great mother,
572120	576120	bathe Tiffany in inner peace, acceptance, and self-care,
576120	578120	and rid her of her toxic,
578120	580120	disnormative, true scum ways.
580120	581120	Amen.
581120	582120	Are we done here?
582120	584120	I don't think I can make it through any more readings
584120	585120	from the SJW prayer book.
585120	587120	Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love
587120	589120	I am trying to deliver unto you?
589120	591120	Because I'm grossed out by you.
591120	592120	That's why.
592120	593120	Okay, then.
593120	595120	Well, namaste, bitch.
595120	599120	Look, why don't we all take a step back
599120	603120	and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform
603120	606120	and let them know how much we appreciate their service.
606120	608120	God, I love the troops.
608120	610120	Thinking about the troops makes me wet.
610120	611120	It makes me cum.
611120	613120	Semper fi, boys.
618120	619120	What?
619120	621120	I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.
621120	623120	Tiffany, your transsexualism,
623120	625120	I have to say I don't love it,
625120	628120	but you do seem to at least be aware
628120	630120	that you have some kind of mental disorder,
630120	631120	so I'll give you that.
631120	634120	Whereas, Baltimore, you're what?
634120	636120	Making some kind of statement?
636120	638120	If my existence is a statement,
638120	640120	I think that says more about society
640120	642120	than it says about me.
642120	643120	Jackie, what you have to understand
643120	646120	is there have been transsexuals around for a long time.
646120	649120	I have talked to 80-year-old transsexuals,
649120	650120	and they agree with me
650120	652120	that all this genderqueer bullshit,
652120	654120	it's just a trend.
654120	655120	It's a fad.
655120	656120	But is it?
656120	657120	For thousands of years,
657120	659120	there have been third-gender groups
659120	660120	across human cultures.
660120	662120	There's the Hydra of India,
662120	665120	the two-spirit people among Native Americans.
665120	667120	Whereas, binary transsexualism
667120	670120	is a medical construct of the 20th century.
670120	674120	Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition
674120	676120	until 2013,
676120	679120	meaning that Tumblr is twice as old
679120	683120	as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis.
683120	686120	So perhaps it is you, Tiffany Tumbles,
686120	690120	and not I who is following a trend.
693120	695120	Wow, that just blew my mind.
695120	697120	The tables are turned, bitch.
697120	699120	Tiffany, could you explain to me
699120	702120	why you decided to become a trans-trender?
706120	708120	He's not Native American, though.
708120	709120	They.
709120	710120	They.
710120	711120	You know, it's kinda hard not to call you he
711120	713120	when you have a fucking beard.
713120	714120	If you were actually trans
714120	715120	and you actually had dysphoria,
715120	717120	then you wouldn't be comfortable with that.
717120	719120	Your Honor, in my defense,
719120	720120	it is a glitter beard.
720120	721120	Okay.
721120	722120	Well, that's very 2019,
722120	724120	very gender, very they,
724120	727120	but what it isn't is two-spirit.
727120	729120	Look, the SJWs don't even agree with this.
729120	730120	They think it's racist.
730120	732120	White people have two genders.
732120	734120	Pick one and sit down, dude.
734120	735120	Yeah, that's a good point.
735120	736120	Two genders.
736120	737120	Two genders.
737120	738120	Attack helicopter.
738120	739120	It's ma'am.
739120	740120	Okay.
740120	741120	Attack helicopter.
741120	742120	Two genders.
742120	743120	Only two genders.
743120	744120	How many genders?
744120	745120	Two.
745120	746120	Attack helicopter.
746120	747120	It's ma'am.
747120	748120	Two genders.
748120	749120	Two genders.
749120	750120	Two genders.
750120	751120	You're just saying that you're me
751120	752120	and talking in a whiny voice.
752120	753120	That is not an argument.
753120	756120	The toxic truce gumbolias are gatekeeping my gender.
756120	757120	I don't have dysphoria,
757120	758120	but for some reason,
758120	759120	I still have access to doctors
759120	760120	like a transition
760120	761120	from a man to a man.
761120	762120	The one thing you'll always have to deal with in life
762120	763120	is assholes.
763120	764120	Oh, but how dare you misgender me?
764120	765120	It's hard to be yourself,
765120	766120	but it's worth it.
766120	767120	How dare you not know that I use they,
767120	768120	then I don't,
768120	769120	even though no one ever sees that.
769120	770120	Let's be ourselves.
770120	771120	Let's totally be ourselves.
771120	772120	All right.
772120	773120	That's enough of this.
773120	774120	You know,
774120	775120	as a biological female,
775120	776120	I honestly don't understand any of this
776120	777120	shitty shit.
777120	778120	Okay.
778120	779120	That was a hard T.
779120	781120	Now, does my husband sometimes wear panties around the house
781120	783120	and ask me to call him mommy's little slut?
783120	784120	Well, sure,
784120	788120	but that is a matter between her and the Lord.
788120	790120	Let's best not think about it too much.
790120	792120	Anyway, Tiffany,
792120	794120	my brain has an easier time processing you
794120	796120	than whatever is going on over here,
796120	798120	so congratulations.
798120	799120	You're the winner.
799120	801120	That was some excellent free speech.
801120	802120	Okay.
802120	803120	Great.
803120	805120	So, in conclusion,
805120	807120	trans-trenders are real
807120	808120	and probably dangerous.
808120	810120	Make sure to protect your children.
810120	811120	Bye.
811120	813120	As for how many genders there are,
813120	814120	you know,
814120	815120	I'm going to take the centrist route
815120	817120	and say two and a half.
817120	818120	All right.
818120	819120	That's our show.
819120	820120	This has been the Freedom Report
820120	823120	where the debate never stops.
823120	825120	Except when the show is over.
825120	827120	Get out.
827120	828120	The girl can't help it.
828120	829120	She's a Libra.
835120	836120	Behold,
836120	837120	the non-binary lamb
837120	839120	who is despised and rejected.
839120	840120	They gave their cheek
840120	842120	to them that mocked their beard
842120	844120	and hid not their face from shame.
844120	845120	But lo,
845120	846120	Tiffany,
846120	847120	the person who tricks
847120	849120	trendier than thou,
849120	850120	a shady queen,
850120	852120	came next upon her friend Justine
852120	855120	and sought her counsel thus.
870120	873120	God damn it, Justine.
873120	874120	I just can't
874120	875120	with these trenders anymore.
875120	877120	I simply cannot.
877120	878120	You know,
878120	879120	you can just text me here
879120	881120	and I'll come open the door.
881120	882120	Okay.
882120	884120	Seems a little formal.
884120	885120	Ugh.
885120	887120	You look great, hon.
887120	888120	Cute.
888120	889120	Justine,
889120	890120	you look like absolute shit.
890120	891120	What happened?
891120	892120	Did the cat girl
892120	893120	finally beat you up?
893120	894120	No.
894120	895120	I...
895120	896120	Justine, look,
896120	897120	I slept in my makeup, okay?
897120	898120	Leave me alone.
898120	899120	I've been having a difficult time.
899120	900120	Were we serving
900120	901120	a little depression moment?
901120	902120	Jesus.
902120	903120	Well,
903120	904120	don't leave me out.
904120	905120	I saw you
905120	906120	on the Freedom Report today.
906120	907120	Okay, girl,
907120	908120	can we talk about
908120	909120	Ladybeard, Baltimore, Maryland?
909120	910120	Ugh.
910120	911120	Add that one
911120	912120	to the crazy
912120	913120	tranny hall of fame.
913120	914120	Really?
914120	915120	You're happy
915120	916120	with the way that went?
916120	917120	You feel good about that?
917120	918120	You feel good
918120	919120	about yourself right now?
919120	920120	Well,
920120	921120	why wouldn't I?
921120	922120	Tiffany,
922120	923120	there is nothing
923120	924120	more sad
924120	925120	and pathetic
925120	926120	and desperate
926120	927120	and low in this world
927120	928120	than a tran
928120	929120	who thinks
929120	930120	she's better
930120	931120	than other trans.
931120	932120	It's like a drunk
932120	933120	feeling superior
933120	934120	to a junkie.
934120	935120	You seem to think
935120	936120	that you're queen
936120	937120	of the world
937120	938120	because you're hanging on
938120	939120	to societal acceptance
939120	940120	by two fingers
940120	941120	instead of one.
941120	942120	Well,
942120	943120	you're not, bitch.
943120	944120	You're just an insecure,
944120	945120	frightened little queer
945120	946120	who's determined
946120	947120	to use the one ounce
947120	948120	of power you have
948120	949120	to tread
949120	950120	other people down.
950120	951120	And if I'm being honest,
951120	952120	I don't find
952120	953120	that very admirable.
956120	957120	Your eyelash
957120	958120	is coming unglued.
958120	959120	Ugh.
959120	962120	My life is coming unglued.
962120	963120	Ugh.
963120	964120	Look,
964120	965120	it's not like I'm coming
965120	966120	after trannies
966120	967120	who just can't afford
967120	968120	to transition
968120	969120	or don't have
969120	970120	the social support.
970120	971120	It's not like Baltimore
971120	972120	is doing everything
972120	973120	he can to pass
973120	974120	and people just treat him
974120	975120	like a freak
975120	976120	for no reason.
976120	977120	They.
977120	978120	It's they.
978120	979120	Are we really saying
979120	980120	they now?
980120	981120	In private?
981120	982120	Yes,
982120	983120	we are.
983120	984120	So get used to it.
984120	985120	My name is Justine.
985120	986120	I think misgendering
986120	987120	is toxic
987120	988120	because I care
988120	989120	about people's feelings.
989120	990120	Ugh.
990120	991120	I always forget
991120	992120	that you're like
992120	993120	actually an SJW.
993120	994120	I always forget
994120	995120	that you're actually
995120	996120	an asshole.
996120	997120	Why do I even hang out
997120	998120	with you?
998120	999120	Oh,
999120	1000120	because you hate yourself
1000120	1001120	and you have to believe
1001120	1002120	there's hope for me
1002120	1003120	because if there's hope
1003120	1004120	for me,
1004120	1005120	there might be hope
1005120	1006120	for you.
1006120	1007120	Wow,
1007120	1008120	you're developing
1008120	1009120	self-consciousness.
1009120	1010120	Where'd you learn
1010120	1011120	that trick?
1011120	1012120	Gigi?
1012120	1013120	Tiffany,
1013120	1014120	have you ever
1014120	1015120	been bullied?
1015120	1016120	Oh,
1016120	1017120	let's see.
1017120	1018120	You don't see me
1018120	1019120	going on talk shows
1019120	1020120	to play the victim.
1020120	1021120	No,
1021120	1022120	I see you going
1022120	1023120	on talk shows
1023120	1024120	to play the bully.
1024120	1025120	I think you grew up
1025120	1026120	getting bullied
1026120	1027120	for being a sissy
1027120	1028120	till you started passing
1028120	1029120	as a woman
1029120	1030120	and then you got
1030120	1031120	a little taste of normal
1031120	1032120	and now you want
1032120	1033120	to be the one
1033120	1034120	who bashes the queers.
1034120	1035120	Bash them?
1035120	1036120	If anything,
1036120	1037120	I'm the one
1037120	1038120	defending trans people
1038120	1039120	from appropriation
1039120	1040120	and misrepresentation
1040120	1041120	by these trenders.
1041120	1042120	You said on air
1042120	1043120	that Baltimore
1043120	1044120	grosses you out.
1044120	1045120	Do you really
1045120	1046120	expect me to believe
1046120	1047120	that you have
1047120	1048120	anything to do
1048120	1049120	with your own
1049120	1050120	self-loathing?
1050120	1051120	How could it be
1051120	1052120	self-loathing
1052120	1053120	when Baltimore
1053120	1054120	is nothing
1054120	1055120	like me?
1055120	1056120	Okay,
1056120	1057120	then it's just bigotry.
1057120	1058120	That's even worse.
1058120	1059120	Oh,
1059120	1060120	it's not bigotry.
1060120	1061120	Look,
1061120	1062120	I shouldn't have said
1062120	1063120	grossed out,
1063120	1064120	I'll give you that,
1064120	1065120	but he does,
1065120	1066120	they do
1066120	1067120	make me uncomfortable.
1067120	1068120	And why do you
1068120	1069120	think that is?
1069120	1070120	Ugh,
1070120	1071120	I got secondhand dysphoria
1071120	1072120	looking at someone
1072120	1073120	so burgeoning.
1073120	1074120	Ugh,
1074120	1075120	it makes me want
1075120	1076120	to down a bottle
1076120	1077120	of whiskey
1077120	1078120	and you just
1078120	1079120	clock everything
1079120	1080120	and you feel like
1080120	1081120	sympathetic
1081120	1082120	vibrations
1082120	1083120	of dysphoria.
1083120	1084120	Yeah,
1084120	1085120	I do know
1085120	1086120	what you're talking about
1086120	1087120	and I'll tell you
1087120	1088120	why it happens.
1088120	1089120	When you're early
1089120	1090120	in your transition
1090120	1091120	and you're doing
1091120	1092120	everything you can
1092120	1093120	to pass,
1093120	1094120	you develop
1094120	1095120	a really sophisticated eye
1095120	1096120	for every little thing
1096120	1097120	that makes you clockable.
1097120	1098120	Then,
1098120	1099120	you turn that
1099120	1100120	sophisticated eye
1100120	1101120	onto other
1101120	1102120	trans people
1102120	1103120	and you project
1103120	1104120	your dysphoria
1104120	1105120	onto them.
1105120	1106120	I buy that.
1106120	1107120	This is
1107120	1108120	other trans people's
1108120	1109120	presentation.
1109120	1110120	Secondhand dysphoria
1110120	1111120	is not valid.
1111120	1112120	The fact that
1112120	1113120	you project
1113120	1114120	your dysphoria
1114120	1115120	onto other people
1115120	1116120	is your problem
1116120	1117120	and your problem alone.
1117120	1118120	And you need to deal
1118120	1119120	with that issue
1119120	1120120	in private,
1120120	1121120	girl,
1121120	1122120	not on a fucking
1122120	1123120	talk show.
1123120	1124120	Yeah,
1124120	1125120	you're probably
1125120	1126120	right about that.
1126120	1127120	But it still
1127120	1128120	doesn't make
1128120	1129120	Baltimore,
1129120	1130120	Maryland
1130120	1131120	any more valid.
1131120	1132120	Tiffany,
1132120	1133120	let's be pragmatic
1133120	1134120	about this.
1134120	1135120	Suppose everything
1135120	1136120	you do
1136120	1137120	is for the
1137120	1138120	sake
1138120	1139120	of
1139120	1140120	transsexuals.
1140120	1141120	Every time
1141120	1142120	you say the word
1142120	1143120	transsexual,
1143120	1144120	I feel like
1144120	1145120	it's 1978.
1145120	1146120	Are you 80 years old?
1146120	1147120	I guess you could say
1147120	1148120	I'm not the trendiest person.
1148120	1149120	Haha.
1149120	1150120	Look,
1150120	1151120	suppose you're right
1151120	1152120	and everyone
1152120	1153120	who doesn't meet
1153120	1154120	your definition
1154120	1155120	of a transsexual
1155120	1156120	is some kind of
1156120	1157120	confused trend follower.
1157120	1158120	Even if that were true,
1158120	1159120	and to be clear,
1159120	1160120	it isn't,
1160120	1161120	what you're doing
1161120	1162120	harms
1162120	1163120	even the trans people
1163120	1164120	you think are valid
1164120	1165120	about their gender
1165120	1166120	and of having
1166120	1167120	non-conforming expression
1167120	1168120	and you're going around
1168120	1169120	enforcing a stigma
1169120	1170120	against that.
1170120	1171120	Didn't you ever
1171120	1172120	have doubts
1172120	1173120	about your gender?
1173120	1174120	Weren't you ever
1174120	1175120	androgynous?
1175120	1176120	Oh yeah,
1176120	1177120	I mean,
1177120	1178120	I was never
1178120	1179120	that burgeoning,
1179120	1180120	but I had my little
1180120	1181120	cringe here
1181120	1182120	being a non-binary
1182120	1183120	SJW.
1183120	1184120	Uh huh.
1184120	1185120	And one of the great
1185120	1186120	things about
1186120	1187120	non-binary identities
1187120	1188120	is they give
1188120	1189120	trans people
1189120	1190120	the conceptual
1190120	1191120	space to exist
1191120	1192120	even when
1192120	1193120	neither gender
1193120	1194120	confuses them.
1194120	1195120	Has it occurred to you
1195120	1196120	that being shamed
1196120	1197120	and berated
1197120	1198120	for being a trender
1198120	1199120	during your
1199120	1200120	exploration year
1200120	1201120	might not have been
1201120	1202120	the most helpful thing?
1202120	1203120	Not really.
1203120	1204120	I have dysphoria
1204120	1205120	so if anyone
1205120	1206120	called me a trender
1206120	1207120	I'd eventually
1207120	1208120	prove them wrong.
1208120	1209120	That's all I'm saying.
1209120	1210120	If you're not a trender,
1210120	1211120	then transition.
1211120	1212120	Prove me wrong.
1212120	1213120	The stigma
1213120	1214120	you perpetuate
1214120	1215120	against gender confusion
1215120	1216120	and experimentation
1216120	1217120	keeps trans people
1217120	1218120	in the closet
1218120	1219120	and delays transition.
1219120	1220120	It alienates
1220120	1221120	baby trans
1221120	1222120	from the community
1222120	1223120	instead of publicly
1223120	1224120	humiliating them.
1224120	1225120	And when you
1225120	1226120	appoint yourself
1226120	1227120	the public decider
1227120	1228120	of whomst is
1228120	1229120	really trans,
1229120	1230120	the Torquemada
1230120	1231120	of the trender
1231120	1232120	inquisition,
1232120	1233120	you're terrorizing
1233120	1234120	a lot of people
1234120	1235120	who are genuinely
1235120	1236120	trying to figure
1236120	1237120	themselves out.
1237120	1238120	Okay.
1238120	1239120	But then
1239120	1240120	how do we decide
1240120	1241120	which trendies
1241120	1242120	are valid?
1242120	1243120	We don't.
1243120	1244120	Then this is
1244120	1245120	where I'm losing you.
1245120	1246120	Because trans trenders
1246120	1247120	are absolutely a thing.
1247120	1248120	Like, undeniably.
1248120	1249120	I've talked to people
1249120	1250120	who've literally told me
1250120	1251120	they used to be
1251120	1252120	trans trenders.
1252120	1253120	Some people
1253120	1254120	question their gender
1254120	1255120	but end up deciding
1255120	1256120	they're not really trans.
1256120	1257120	There is nothing
1257120	1258120	wrong with that.
1258120	1259120	And those people
1259120	1260120	still aren't being helped
1260120	1261120	by public shaming.
1261120	1262120	Well, maybe they wouldn't
1262120	1263120	be confused in the first place
1263120	1264120	if SJWs weren't
1264120	1265120	going around
1265120	1266120	telling people
1266120	1267120	they don't need dysphoria
1267120	1268120	to be trans.
1268120	1269120	You know,
1269120	1270120	it's one thing
1270120	1271120	if teenage girls
1271120	1272120	want to dye their hair pink
1272120	1273120	and call themselves
1273120	1274120	Demi Boys
1274120	1275120	for most of sophomore year.
1275120	1276120	But some of these kids
1276120	1277120	are actually gonna
1277120	1278120	medically transition.
1278120	1279120	And soon,
1279120	1280120	we're gonna have
1280120	1281120	an epidemic
1281120	1282120	of detransitioners
1282120	1283120	who told you so
1283120	1284120	op-eds
1284120	1285120	in every major newspaper.
1285120	1286120	Now, maybe you think
1286120	1287120	that's worth it
1287120	1288120	just to make sure
1288120	1289120	no one ever feels
1289120	1290120	invalidated
1290120	1291120	for any reason.
1291120	1292120	But I think
1292120	1293120	that's highly irresponsible.
1293120	1294120	Look,
1294120	1295120	if you're so worried
1295120	1296120	about people
1296120	1297120	feeling pressured
1297120	1298120	to medically transition,
1298120	1299120	then what you should be doing
1299120	1300120	is working to make
1300120	1301120	the trans community
1301120	1302120	as inclusive
1302120	1303120	and welcoming
1303120	1304120	as possible
1304120	1305120	to gender non-conforming people
1305120	1306120	and non-binary people
1306120	1307120	and people
1307120	1308120	who are questioning
1308120	1309120	and trans people
1309120	1310120	who don't medically transition.
1310120	1311120	But instead,
1311120	1312120	you're doing
1312120	1313120	the exact opposite.
1313120	1314120	You're telling everyone
1314120	1315120	that medical transition
1315120	1316120	is the only way
1316120	1317120	to be valid.
1317120	1318120	And if anything
1318120	1319120	is pressuring people
1319120	1320120	to medically transition,
1320120	1321120	it's that.
1321120	1322120	Justine,
1322120	1323120	I think
1323120	1324120	you're a good person.
1324120	1325120	Maybe too good.
1325120	1326120	And that's why
1326120	1327120	you're trying
1327120	1328120	to have compassion
1328120	1329120	for everyone.
1329120	1330120	But at some point,
1330120	1331120	you have to protect yourself.
1331120	1332120	We live in a world
1332120	1333120	of Jackie Jacksons
1333120	1334120	who don't understand
1334120	1335120	trans people
1335120	1336120	and don't think
1336120	1337120	we're real.
1337120	1338120	So we need to have
1338120	1339120	an explanation
1339120	1340120	of what it is
1340120	1341120	to be trans
1341120	1342120	and not feelings.
1342120	1343120	And the most factual
1343120	1344120	explanation
1344120	1345120	is transmedicalism,
1345120	1346120	which is the idea
1346120	1347120	that transsexualism
1347120	1348120	is a diagnosable
1348120	1349120	mental disorder
1349120	1350120	called gender dysphoria.
1350120	1351120	There's science
1351120	1352120	to back this up.
1352120	1353120	It's accepted
1353120	1354120	by medical professionals
1354120	1355120	and it clearly explains
1355120	1357120	why we are valid
1357120	1358120	unlike Rachel Dolezal
1358120	1359120	and snowflake
1359120	1360120	gender teenagers
1360120	1361120	and people
1361120	1362120	who identify
1362120	1363120	as cats.
1363120	1364120	Okay,
1364120	1365120	I see the appeal
1365120	1366120	but I don't think
1366120	1367120	transmedicalism
1367120	1368120	is as validating
1368120	1369120	as you think it is.
1369120	1370120	Why not?
1370120	1371120	Apparently.
1371120	1372120	Why does having
1372120	1373120	gender dysphoria
1373120	1374120	make you a woman?
1374120	1375120	Because gender dysphoria
1375120	1376120	means I have
1376120	1377120	a female brain.
1377120	1378120	No it doesn't.
1378120	1379120	I'm sorry to tell you
1379120	1380120	but the science
1380120	1381120	does not say
1381120	1382120	what you think it says.
1382120	1383120	There may be neurological
1383120	1384120	causes of gender dysphoria
1384120	1385120	but at the end
1385120	1386120	of the day
1386120	1387120	all dysphoria is
1387120	1388120	is discomfort
1388120	1389120	in a male body
1389120	1390120	or a male social role
1390120	1391120	or however you want
1391120	1392120	to put it.
1392120	1393120	And wanting
1393120	1394120	to be a woman
1394120	1395120	is not the same thing
1395120	1397120	as being a woman.
1397120	1399120	Not by any means.
1399120	1400120	Girl, where are you
1400120	1401120	going with this?
1401120	1402120	What is this?
1402120	1403120	Are you becoming
1403120	1404120	a TERF?
1404120	1405120	No, I just don't think
1405120	1406120	your theory actually validates
1406120	1407120	our womanhood.
1407120	1408120	Well if you're right
1408120	1409120	that's a real problem
1409120	1410120	because we need
1410120	1411120	to have reason
1411120	1412120	and science
1412120	1413120	and logic
1413120	1414120	and facts
1414120	1415120	on our side
1415120	1416120	so that we can explain
1416120	1417120	to society
1417120	1418120	that we are valid
1418120	1419120	and that we are real
1419120	1420120	otherwise
1420120	1421120	bad things.
1421120	1422120	Well maybe there's
1422120	1423120	a better theory.
1423120	1424120	Well okay Socrates
1424120	1425120	let's hear it then.
1425120	1426120	The way I see it
1426120	1427120	gender is either
1427120	1428120	psychological
1428120	1429120	or biological
1429120	1430120	or social.
1430120	1431120	Now my friend Tabby
1431120	1432120	the cat girl
1432120	1433120	she thinks it's
1433120	1434120	all psychological
1434120	1435120	that it's just
1435120	1436120	identity
1436120	1437120	that whatever you think
1437120	1438120	about your own gender
1438120	1439120	is true.
1439120	1440120	And that makes me
1440120	1441120	really uncomfortable
1441120	1442120	because then
1442120	1443120	what's the difference
1443120	1444120	between identifying
1444120	1445120	as a woman
1445120	1446120	and identifying
1446120	1447120	as a Norwegian forest cat?
1447120	1448120	It's a difference
1448120	1449120	that Tabby herself
1449120	1450120	seems not to have
1450120	1451120	much of a grip on.
1451120	1452120	Girl that's literally
1452120	1453120	what I've been trying
1453120	1454120	to tell you about
1454120	1455120	trans-trenders
1455120	1456120	this entire time.
1456120	1457120	Just let me finish.
1457120	1458120	If gender is strictly
1458120	1459120	biological
1459120	1460120	it doesn't influence people
1460120	1461120	unless you make
1461120	1462120	some kind of
1462120	1463120	wrong brain
1463120	1464120	and the wrong body argument
1464120	1465120	but I told you
1465120	1466120	I'm not buying that.
1466120	1467120	So that leaves
1467120	1468120	gender as a social construct.
1468120	1469120	Are you going to try
1469120	1470120	to make me read
1470120	1471120	Judith Butler again?
1471120	1472120	I'll summarize it.
1472120	1473120	Gender is a series
1473120	1474120	of gestures.
1474120	1475120	It's called performativity.
1475120	1476120	It's the way you dress.
1476120	1477120	It's the way you speak.
1477120	1478120	It's the way you act.
1478120	1479120	It's the way you relate
1479120	1480120	to other people.
1480120	1481120	Through transitioning
1481120	1482120	we habituate
1482120	1483120	to the gestures
1483120	1484120	of womanhood
1484120	1485120	and socially
1485120	1486120	that makes us women
1486120	1487120	regardless of
1487120	1488120	biology or psychology
1488120	1489120	checkmate
1489120	1490120	or transphobe.
1492120	1493120	Okay.
1493120	1494120	The problem with that
1494120	1495120	is that it's both
1495120	1496120	too exclusionary
1496120	1497120	and too inclusive.
1497120	1498120	It excludes
1498120	1499120	a lot of trans people
1499120	1500120	who can't transition
1500120	1502120	for circumstantial reasons
1502120	1503120	but whose dysphoria
1503120	1504120	is very real.
1504120	1505120	And it includes
1505120	1506120	every trans-trender
1506120	1507120	drag queen
1507120	1508120	fetishist
1508120	1509120	and two-bit
1509120	1510120	cross-dressing comedian
1510120	1511120	in a dine-out wig.
1512120	1513120	Well,
1513120	1514120	do you really believe
1514120	1515120	that a man who plays
1515120	1516120	a woman on stage
1516120	1517120	becomes just as much
1517120	1518120	of a woman
1518120	1519120	as you and me?
1519120	1520120	Uh,
1520120	1521120	yes?
1521120	1522120	Bitch,
1522120	1523120	no you don't.
1523120	1524120	Yeah,
1524120	1525120	you're right.
1525120	1526120	I'm full of shit.
1526120	1527120	I know you are
1527120	1528120	because you're an SJW
1528120	1529120	and SJWs hate
1529120	1530120	performativity theory
1530120	1531120	almost as much
1531120	1532120	as they hate me.
1532120	1533120	Well,
1533120	1534120	they only hate it
1534120	1535120	because they don't understand it.
1535120	1536120	They think it invalidates
1536120	1537120	non-binary identities
1537120	1538120	but in fact
1538120	1539120	it's the most rational way
1539120	1540120	to explain
1540120	1541120	non-binary identities.
1541120	1542120	How can you perform
1542120	1543120	a non-binary identity?
1543120	1544120	Simple.
1544120	1545120	You learn the rules
1545120	1546120	so you can break them.
1546120	1547120	Wearing a beard
1547120	1548120	and a dress
1548120	1549120	and the gesture
1549120	1550120	of declaring
1550120	1551120	I am neither a man
1551120	1552120	or a woman
1552120	1553120	is a speech act
1553120	1554120	that removes the speaker
1554120	1555120	from the semantics
1555120	1556120	Girl,
1556120	1557120	shut up.
1557120	1558120	This is too much philosophizing.
1558120	1559120	I can't stand it anymore.
1559120	1560120	Why don't you tell me
1560120	1561120	what's really going on with you?
1561120	1562120	Why do you look like
1562120	1563120	you've been in a k-hole
1563120	1564120	for a week?
1564120	1565120	Why are you suddenly
1565120	1566120	so obsessed
1566120	1567120	with white knighting
1567120	1568120	for non-binary people?
1568120	1569120	Because I am non-binary.
1570120	1571120	No you're not.
1571120	1572120	What are you talking about?
1573120	1574120	I just
1574120	1575120	feel like
1575120	1576120	since I started transitioning
1576120	1577120	I've been trying
1577120	1578120	so hard
1578120	1579120	to fit in
1579120	1580120	and to perform
1580120	1581120	my gender
1581120	1582120	and to pass
1582120	1583120	and to just be normal.
1583120	1584120	But I can't do it anymore.
1584120	1585120	I just cannot
1585120	1586120	make it work.
1586120	1587120	I feel like an actor.
1587120	1588120	I feel like a zombie.
1588120	1589120	Like I'm
1589120	1590120	going through
1590120	1591120	the motions
1591120	1592120	of this new gender role
1592120	1593120	that's supposed
1593120	1594120	to liberate me
1594120	1595120	but that's somehow
1595120	1596120	just as empty
1596120	1597120	as the old one.
1597120	1598120	Because I'm just
1598120	1599120	not normal, Tiffany.
1599120	1600120	I am a freak.
1600120	1601120	And I'm always
1601120	1602120	gonna be a freak.
1602120	1603120	Justine,
1603120	1604120	you're not non-binary.
1604120	1605120	You're gay.
1605120	1606120	And everyone
1606120	1607120	can see this
1607120	1608120	Oh come on.
1608120	1609120	I'm not
1609120	1610120	I'm not
1610120	1611120	gay.
1611120	1612120	Justine
1612120	1613120	was extremely
1613120	1614120	gay.
1615120	1616120	In protest
1616120	1617120	to the Lady May
1617120	1618120	there simply
1618120	1619120	is no stopping
1619120	1620120	gayness.
1620120	1621120	I love
1621120	1622120	cat girls.
1624120	1625120	I hate
1625120	1626120	cat girls
1626120	1627120	but I also
1627120	1628120	love them.
1628120	1629120	Oh
1629120	1630120	abominable
1630120	1631120	fate.
1631120	1632120	Okay.
1632120	1633120	So I'm a little bit
1633120	1634120	gay.
1634120	1635120	Right.
1635120	1636120	And you don't know
1636120	1637120	how to reconcile
1637120	1638120	your gender.
1638120	1639120	That's why you feel
1639120	1640120	this dissonance.
1640120	1641120	Yeah.
1641120	1642120	I guess that's
1642120	1643120	basically it.
1643120	1644120	Well it really shouldn't
1644120	1645120	be that hard, girl.
1645120	1646120	You already came out
1646120	1647120	as a woman.
1647120	1648120	Just blurt it out.
1648120	1649120	Say,
1649120	1650120	Hello world.
1650120	1651120	My name is Justine
1651120	1652120	and I fuck
1652120	1653120	pussy.
1653120	1654120	That's a very
1654120	1655120	cis-normative way to
1655120	1656120	Say it.
1656120	1657120	Hello world.
1657120	1658120	My name is Justine
1658120	1659120	and I fuck
1659120	1660120	pussy.
1660120	1661120	Ugh.
1661120	1662120	I feel like a man
1662120	1663120	when I say it.
1663120	1664120	Yeah.
1664120	1665120	Well you should
1665120	1666120	probably buy a pickup
1666120	1667120	then.
1667120	1668120	Get some of those
1668120	1669120	mud flaps on the back
1669120	1670120	with the little sexy
1670120	1671120	ladies on them
1671120	1672120	and you may as well
1672120	1673120	change your name
1673120	1674120	back to Justine.
1674120	1675120	Okay.
1675120	1676120	Well that's just
1676120	1677120	uncalled for.
1677120	1678120	Girl, I don't know
1678120	1679120	what to say except
1679120	1680120	I told you so.
1680120	1681120	Sexuality is just
1681120	1682120	like gender identity.
1682120	1683120	It is not a performance.
1683120	1684120	It's not a trend.
1684120	1685120	It's not a choice.
1685120	1686120	It's just part of
1686120	1687120	who you are
1687120	1688120	and there's nothing
1688120	1689120	you can do to change it.
1689120	1691120	I guess you're right.
1691120	1692120	I guess my theory
1692120	1693120	sucks.
1693120	1694120	It sucks so fucking
1694120	1695120	hard.
1695120	1696120	But the good news
1696120	1697120	is you can unclench
1697120	1698120	your asshole now
1698120	1699120	and do whatever you
1699120	1700120	want because you're
1700120	1701120	still a woman
1701120	1702120	whether you're
1702120	1703120	performing a stereotype
1703120	1704120	or not.
1704120	1705120	So run free,
1705120	1706120	Justine.
1706120	1707120	Go top a cis woman.
1707120	1708120	Bang a gay guy.
1708120	1709120	Wear some oversized
1709120	1710120	flannel.
1710120	1711120	Do whatever you
1711120	1712120	want.
1712120	1713120	Wow.
1713120	1714120	Yeah.
1714120	1715120	I guess that is
1715120	1716120	pretty liberating.
1716120	1717120	Yeah.
1717120	1718120	Thank God for
1718120	1719120	transmedicalism,
1719120	1720120	right?
1720120	1721120	Oh, except not
1721120	1722120	because you just
1722120	1723120	destroyed transmedicalism
1723120	1724120	with facts and logic
1724120	1725120	so we have no theory.
1725120	1726120	What do we do now?
1726120	1727120	How do we prove
1727120	1728120	we're valid?
1728120	1729120	Well, just do what
1729120	1730120	every trans woman
1730120	1731120	has done since
1731120	1732120	the beginning of time.
1732120	1733120	Go out and fuck
1733120	1734120	the most brutally
1734120	1735120	heterosexual man
1735120	1736120	you can find
1736120	1737120	and be validated
1737120	1738120	and come.
1738120	1739120	Oh, honey,
1739120	1740120	I have and I will
1740120	1741120	but that's not going
1741120	1742120	to convince anyone
1742120	1743120	but me.
1743120	1744120	It's not a proof.
1744120	1745120	It's not a theory.
1745120	1746120	Well, maybe
1746120	1747120	we don't need a theory.
1747120	1748120	Maybe we don't need
1748120	1749120	to prove anything.
1749120	1750120	Bad things,
1750120	1751120	Justine.
1751120	1752120	Bad things.
1752120	1753120	Do we have a theory
1753120	1754120	about why people
1754120	1755120	are trans?
1755120	1756120	No.
1756120	1757120	They just are.
1757120	1758120	The only reason
1758120	1759120	we even feel like
1759120	1760120	we need a theory
1760120	1761120	about trans people
1761120	1762120	is that society
1762120	1763120	is so unaccepting
1763120	1764120	of us
1764120	1765120	that it's constantly
1765120	1766120	demanding we justify
1766120	1767120	our own reality.
1767120	1768120	Okay.
1768120	1769120	So what am I supposed
1769120	1770120	to tell Jackie Jackson
1770120	1771120	then?
1771120	1772120	What am I supposed
1772120	1773120	to tell the TERFs?
1773120	1774120	That I'm a woman
1774120	1775120	because reasons?
1775120	1776120	No.
1776120	1777120	Not even because reasons.
1777120	1778120	Just because you are.
1778120	1779120	So it's what?
1779120	1780120	A leap of faith?
1780120	1781120	Oh, great.
1781120	1782120	I'm sure that's
1782120	1783120	going to convince
1783120	1784120	us to believe
1784120	1785120	that we are
1785120	1786120	trans.
1786120	1787120	It makes us sound
1787120	1788120	completely delusional.
1788120	1789120	Well, Tiffany,
1789120	1790120	delusion
1790120	1791120	is what separates
1791120	1792120	us from the animals.
1792120	1793120	Who do you think
1793120	1794120	built the pyramids
1794120	1795120	and the cathedrals?
1795120	1796120	Clearly not people
1796120	1797120	with a perfectly
1797120	1798120	rational worldview.
1798120	1799120	But what do you care anyway?
1799120	1800120	Aren't you the one
1800120	1801120	who thinks being trans
1801120	1802120	is a mental disorder?
1802120	1803120	Well, I wouldn't
1803120	1804120	describe it as
1804120	1805120	the height of sanity,
1805120	1806120	but I would prefer
1806120	1807120	to think that my whole
1807120	1808120	life and identity
1808120	1809120	is based on something
1809120	1810120	I can rationally explain.
1810120	1811120	Well, what are we, Tiffany?
1811120	1812120	Men?
1812120	1813120	Can we wrap up
1813120	1814120	the entire world
1814120	1815120	in a little
1815120	1816120	rational box?
1816120	1817120	Maybe the most
1817120	1818120	important things
1818120	1819120	in life can't
1819120	1820120	be logically proved.
1820120	1821120	Can you logically prove
1821120	1822120	that you love
1822120	1823120	your own children?
1823120	1824120	No.
1824120	1825120	And the attempt
1825120	1826120	to prove it
1826120	1827120	is as degrading
1827120	1828120	as it is futile.
1828120	1829120	Maybe gender identity
1829120	1830120	is one of those things.
1830120	1831120	Okay, but then
1831120	1832120	how do I prove
1832120	1833120	I'm more valid
1833120	1834120	than Baltimore,
1834120	1835120	Maryland,
1835120	1836120	and the star genders,
1836120	1837120	and the cat people?
1837120	1838120	Well, maybe
1838120	1839120	we should stop
1839120	1840120	getting so caught up
1840120	1841120	in proving
1841120	1842120	our validity
1842120	1843120	to ourselves
1843120	1844120	that we end up
1844120	1845120	being horribly cruel
1845120	1846120	to other people.
1846120	1847120	What if we just
1847120	1848120	accept all the freaks
1848120	1849120	of the world?
1849120	1850120	At the end of the day,
1850120	1851120	maybe it's just not
1851120	1852120	as important
1852120	1853120	to have logical proofs
1853120	1854120	as it is to be
1854120	1855120	empathetic
1855120	1856120	and open-minded
1856120	1857120	and compassionate.
1858120	1861120	Kumbaya, my lord,
1861120	1863120	kumbaya.
1863120	1865120	Kumbaya, my lord,
1865120	1867120	kumbaya.
1867120	1868120	Tiffany.
1868120	1870120	Kumbaya, my lord,
1870120	1871120	kumbaya.
1871120	1872120	Kumbaya, my lord,
1872120	1873120	kumbaya.
1873120	1874120	I have something
1874120	1875120	to tell you.
1875120	1876120	Here it comes.
1876120	1877120	I love you.
1877120	1878120	Okay.
1878120	1879120	Well, I'm going
1879120	1880120	to get going now.
1880120	1881120	I have an important
1881120	1882120	date tonight,
1882120	1883120	drinking vodka
1883120	1884120	cranberries
1884120	1885120	and reading
1885120	1886120	YouTube comments
1886120	1887120	by myself.
1887120	1888120	So I'd really better
1888120	1889120	go do that,
1889120	1890120	but good luck
1890120	1891120	with your new life
1891120	1892120	as a male lesbian
1892120	1893120	who fucks cats.
1893120	1894120	Ugh.
1894120	1895120	I love you.
1895120	1896120	I love you.
1896120	1897120	I love you.
1897120	1898120	I love you.
1898120	1899120	I love you.
1899120	1900120	I love you.
1900120	1901120	I love you.
1901120	1902120	Oh, are you upset?
1902120	1904120	She has to go.
1904120	1906120	I'm sorry.
1909120	1912120	I hate this bitch.
1912120	1913120	But God,
1913120	1914120	she's a yum yum.
1919120	1921120	Hearken, children.
1921120	1922120	In this vision
1922120	1923120	ye have witnessed
1923120	1924120	world fools
1924120	1925120	upon the screen.
1925120	1926120	Fools
1926120	1927120	who do not love
1927120	1928120	themselves,
1928120	1929120	but otherwise
1929120	1934840	I, your goddess, mother, queen, messiah, I am nothing like them.
1935200	1942560	For I am truth, I am light, I am in capitalism, and everything I tweet is woke.
1942940	1945800	But most importantly, I love myself.
1946280	1950300	I love myself so much it makes me wet, it makes me cum.
1950300	1955840	Praise be up to me, hallelujah, like, comment, and subscribe, amen.
1959120	1989100	Thank you for watching.
1989120	2019100	Thank you for watching.
2019120	2049100	Thank you for watching.
2049120	2079100	Thank you for watching.
2079120	2084120	Thank you for watching.
