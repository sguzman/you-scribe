00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,620
what

00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:07,540
you say it only matters that you say we don't discriminate here between what is true or false

10
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:13,380
or even downright dangerous that's none of my business it's none of america's business

11
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:21,140
the important thing is that you never stop talking because that's what freedom is all about

Anarchy? What does that even mean? Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:40,320
The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with aimless

27
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:46,200
fornication. They're tearing apart the social fabric and normal Americans are being silenced.

28
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,080
That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel culture, PC, CRT, SJW, globo, homo, pomo, nomo.

29
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,960
The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.

30
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,500
And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in America,

31
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:12,200
the Christian majority. Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little

32
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:18,300
more specific? Of course, Jackie. Religious liberties are under attack. We're losing our

33
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:23,820
right to teach biblical morality to children who are growing up in public schools run by

34
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,060
socialists. We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children who are growing up

35
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,900
social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender neutral bathrooms and drag

36
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,740
queen story hour than teach young people about the wonder working power of the precious blood

37
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,440
of the lamb. Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country. I'm sorry that you feel offended

38
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,620
by it. Believe it or not, the founding fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever

39
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,680
twisted necromancy these people think is Christianity. Jackie, these communists are

40
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
polluting the innocence of children.

41
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,500
And if you speak out against the grooming, they call you a bigot. Parents get no say anymore.

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,900
They're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns about the deviant lifestyles promoted in

43
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:10,840
schools. You know, one day your kids will come home and you won't even recognize them anymore.

44
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:16,960
That's the real agenda here. Sexual indoctrination. This generation that's coming up,

45
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:23,800
20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the remaining

46
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:31,820
70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists, or worse,

47
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:38,540
Episcopalians. No. No, I won't stand for that. I'm sorry, what does this have to do with drugs?

48
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:45,360
Well, everything. Addiction and sexual brokenness. These are two heads of the same serpent,

49
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,540
symptoms of the same cultural leprosy. Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers,

50
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,680
childhood.

51
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:59,420
Is anyone going to ask me what I think? Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen

52
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:05,620
to the ramblings of a bigoted hate preacher? Well, God has nothing to do with hate. Christ is the

53
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,660
definition of love. Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia. I'm talking about you. Justine,

54
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:17,500
if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot? You liberals call everyone who disagrees

55
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,540
with you a bigot. Exactly. Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once and have a calm,

56
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:28,260
rational conversation with people who have different opinions?

57
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:34,780
Okay, well, let's see how that goes. Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to

58
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:41,160
set people free from sexual brokenness and protect the rights of children. Kids who are struggling

59
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,660
with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative therapy that will make them

60
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:53,580
whole again. Reparative therapy? You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?

61
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,160
What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken and

62
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,980
polluted and they need God to make them whole. You people are selling the cure to a sickness

63
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,940
you created. Are you cancel-culturing me right now? Oh my god, she's totally cancel-culturing

64
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:18,140
you right now. Are you thought-policing me? No, I'm trying to stop you from thought-policing

65
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,280
everyone else. You're saying it should be a thought crime? You're saying that I am a thought

66
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,780
criminal? Justine, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

67
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:27,860
because I happen to believe in the traditional biblical definition of marriage

68
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,940
between a man and a woman who form a covenant before God

69
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,340
who gave his only begotten son to wash away the sins of the world

70
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,180
when he died on the cross and was resurrected three days later,

71
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,200
all glory to his name.

72
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,000
Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.

73
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,300
And I'm sure the blue check Twitter mob is already coming for me

74
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,680
because you can't say anything anymore.

75
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,040
And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.

76
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,640
You know who's really being silenced?

77
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,600
People who are silent.

78
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,480
Being silent is a big part of being silenced.

79
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,540
That's what being silenced means.

80
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:01,840
So who's really being silenced?

81
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,880
Not people on podcasts.

82
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:08,560
Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history

83
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,080
about how silenced they are.

84
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,420
No, the people who are silenced are people we never hear from.

85
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,860
Because, and I really can't emphasize this enough,

86
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,100
they are silenced.

87
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,720
People in prison.

88
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Queer teenagers in conservative towns.

89
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,620
The actual downtrodden and oppressed people of this country.

90
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,620
Not you, Miss America.

91
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,220
Not you, Mother Superior.

92
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
You're not silenced.

93
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,840
You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.

94
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,880
So you defend your right to say it.

95
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,840
Okay, but if I'm not being silenced,

96
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,800
then why can't I say the N-word?

97
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,900
Why do you want to say the N-word?

98
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,880
So I only have freedom of speech

99
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,680
when I can,

100
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,040
which conforms to your liberal ideology?

101
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,200
God, damn it, Jackson.

102
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,520
Um...

103
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,820
That sounds a little bit like...

104
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,880
Bein' silenced?

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,040
She's stonewalling me.

106
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,480
All over America today,

107
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,240
white parents are having to sit their children down

108
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,640
and explain that there's certain words they just can't say

109
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,740
because of the color of their skin.

110
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,600
Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.

111
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,680
would be turned down.

112
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,120
turning in his grave.

113
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,960
Would he?

114
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,740
I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave,

115
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,100
but not for the reasons you think.

116
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,200
Jackie, can I bring this back on topic

117
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,000
and share the good news of the gospel?

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,040
That's not the topic.

119
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,380
I have prayed on this, and honestly,

120
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,700
the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion

121
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,040
for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.

122
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,880
You know, when I look out at all these angry people

123
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,120
at the pride parade, doing all this sexual acting out

124
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,200
and wearing provocative clothing

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,640
in a desperate bid for attention,

126
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,840
I see the broken childhoods,

127
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,880
and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging,

128
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,300
and I feel for them.

129
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,140
I really do.

130
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,620
Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity

131
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,760
on the poor, sad homos.

132
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,760
You know, what you people really love

133
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:11,740
is the aesthetic of being compassionate,

134
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,900
but all you're really doing is calling into question

135
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,040
the worthiness of other people's lives.

136
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,500
Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live,

137
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,660
you know?

138
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,720
Whatever happened to love your neighbor?

139
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,620
Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you

140
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,100
that I'm the most compassionate person that they know,

141
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:33,080
but love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.

142
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:36,380
And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just bow down

143
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:40,480
to the intimidation tactics of the secular ruling elite.

144
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,260
It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions

145
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:46,060
about this narrative we're all being force-fed

146
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,260
that God and scripture have no place

147
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,060
in American life anymore,

148
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:56,060
that we're all supposed to submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats imposing their

149
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:01,380
queer ideology which says that if your child comes home from school and announces she's

150
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,820
a different gender this week, then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's

151
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:07,820
knife.

152
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:13,440
Slicing up tiny little children's bodies, that's where this is headed.

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
The shrine of Moloch.

154
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,040
Oh my god, no one is slicing up children's bodies, what are you talking about?

155
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,540
You absolute lunatic.

156
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:27,480
Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure, I feel I should

157
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:33,800
let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.

158
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,600
Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?

159
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,960
Or should I say, Justin?

160
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,600
Oh come on, really?

161
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,960
Alright, we're doing this.

162
00:10:50,040 --> 00:11:03,100
Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?

163
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,040
Is this a throwback to the 1970s?

164
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,600
No, it's a throw forward to the 20 I don't give a fucks.

165
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,100
Well, don't mind if I do.

166
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,280
Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.

167
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,040
Good Virginia tobacco.

168
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
Jackie.

169
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,800

172
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,840
Excuse me, Jackie, I'm really not comfortable with this.

173
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:39,380
I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today, and I really have nothing to say

174
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,440
to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.

175
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:47,480
Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we

176
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,480
are.

177
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,480
Virginia.

178
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,040
Are you prepared to get splashed?

179
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,160
Then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.

180
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,660
Excuse me?

181
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,660
I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.

182
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,440
I'm a libertarian.

183
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,360
Anything goes baby USA.

184
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,160
Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.

185
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,960
Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage, it would be a

186
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
free for all.

187
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,200
And now, here we are.

188
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,580
96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.

189
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:27,960
It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve.

190
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:35,340
Not Adam and Eve, and Kai and Jaden, and Caden and Lilith and Ashton and Schuyler and Rainbow.

191
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,480
Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism.

192
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,040
And from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.

193
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:45,760
And that's the real agenda here.

194
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,960
These people want to lower the age of consent.

195
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,960
And legally.

196
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:53,560
They have socialized sodomy with all the beasts that walk the Earth and the birds

197
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,220
of the sea and all the fishes of the sky.

198
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,220
All of them?

199
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:07,980
What do Ready Slide and Random

200
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,520
Uh-huh.

201
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:12,740
You know what I thought?

202
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,860
Just...

203
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,340
Prejudice.

204
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,400
Still?

205
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
None?

206
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
None?

207
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:23,480
super provocative super brave and super bold we're living in Orwell's nightmare but you're

208
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:28,760
a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced amazing look I just think it's great that three

209
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:34,380
people with differing opinions can all sit down in a room and have a respectful conversation

210
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,540
well cheers to us is it great you know I don't think it's that great and I don't think there's

211
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:45,720
anything respectful about the two of you sitting here interrogating the morality of queer people

212
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,660
something you know absolutely nothing about oh I know more than you might think I used to be

213
00:13:52,660 --> 00:14:02,220
a homosexual you what no I'm not doing this today I'm sorry you used to be a homosexual that's right

214
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:08,380
Jackie before I was saved here we go I used to be a lesbian that's who I thought I was I lived

215
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:15,460
that lifestyle you used to be a lesbian okay name five things you love about men this should be

216
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,700
good

217
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,440
gather around everyone let's all witness the power of Christ I'm sure this will be very convincing

218
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:28,140
I love the Lord who does not command me to be straight he commands me to be holy fear not

219
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:36,240
you will no longer live in shame for your creator will be your husband okay well if you want to be

220
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,320
the bride of Christ then by all means but you know keep it in the bedroom I'm tired of you

221
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,440
people shoving your lifestyle in everyone's face Virginia I'm confused I thought people

222
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:53,000
are just born that way like Jesus can't change that Jackie the mainstream media establishment

223
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,780
doesn't want you to know that people like me exist because that goes against their narrative

224
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:05,980
but recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories the ploy of the enemy is to make

225
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:13,440
us feel that we cannot change but what if every addict said well I'm just a junkie that's who I am

226
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,180
I sexually identify as a homosexual I'm just a junkie that's who I am I sexually identify as a

227
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:24,980
alcoholic so Jesus can't change me well that's a good point uh no it isn't gay is just a feeling

228
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:33,320
homosexual lust same-sex temptation that's a feeling not an identity like maybe you struggle

229
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:38,880
with wrath but you don't identify as wrathful maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the

230
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:45,020
face I want to punch you in the face and yet you haven't punched me lo and behold you have a

231
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:52,560
desire without acting on the desire when I was saved I left behind the false identity I used to

232
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,320
walk in and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love my old self has been

233
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:05,280
crucified with Christ it is no longer I who lives but Christ lives in me but before I made God Lord

234
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:14,160
of my desires I was controlled by sin by drugs by alcohol by homosexuality so you used to be cool

235
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:22,560
wow behold the power of Christ you think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication yes I do

236
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:28,920
it's pretty cool I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication is this a joke

237
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:37,940
to you do you find this humorous yeah I don't because I have glimpsed the gates of hell

238
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:44,380
where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin away from God shut out from grace

239
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:48,360
tormented by unyielding guilt and shame

240
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:59,340
yes we've all been to Cincinnati can we wrap this back around to the drug topic Virginia

241
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:05,340
you're saying you used to be an addict that's right Jackie what were you addicted to Miracle

242
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:14,280
Whip veggie tales uh communion wafers maybe no I was addicted to alcohol to pornography

243
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:25,500
to lusting after women and to hype hype you Virginia lamb were a hype addict look Virginia

244
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:33,000
can you drop a quick story time on this because I am intrigued Jackie I would love to testify you

245
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,260
know growing up I never really felt connected to my mother girl not this when I left home I was lost

246
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:44,880
I was a wretch I was on fire and I rebuked that fire

247
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:53,700
I used foul language I went out clubbing I cut my hair off I gained weight I was tempted by same

248
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,980
sex attraction and I struggled with gender confusion you know I was always a little more

249
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:04,980
masculine I'd even started down the path toward transgendered I used to shoot up testosterone

250
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,600
that's why my voice is a little lower yeah the two of you sound kind of the same honestly if

251
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,700
I didn't know I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man neither of us is the man

252
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:21,720
Lynn though if anything this one's the man she he's the one injecting testosterone God has healed

253
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:30,480
the feminine within me all along God was tugging at my heart but for me the road to heaven led

254
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:39,360
through hell I felt a terrible void inside I lived in the flesh I lived in sin with another

255
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,940
woman hoping to satisfy that hunger here we go when I gazed upon her beauty I thought

256
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:52,380
sunlight had broken through the clouds but the light I saw was nothing but the fire of my own

257
00:18:52,380 --> 00:19:03,300
wickedness I knew that lifestyle was wrong but I couldn't quit until she broke my heart and then

258
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,600
I was cast into the outer darkness yeah she probably got tired of your

259
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,540
Jesus it was like a part of me was ripped away

260
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,000
and I was left to face

261
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:21,560
brokenness alone what was she a capricorn no a sagittarius well there's your problem

262
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:29,320
next time maybe try a water sign stop interrupting i'm living for the drama jackie i was alone

263
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:39,240
i was suicidal i was an addict i was lost until one day i decided to go to church with my mom

264
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:49,080
and i was surrounded by these women singing what can wash away my sin what can make me whole again

265
00:19:49,880 --> 00:20:00,200
nothing but the blood of jesus that washes white as snow and i felt this tingling all over my body

266
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:07,800
and i knew i was hearing the voice of god for the very first time not just the words of the hymn

267
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,160
but the voice of the father

268
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:15,640
speaking directly to me yes we all like music and suddenly my pain made sense

269
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:23,160
i don't have to live this way anymore in that moment i was transfigured by the holy spirit

270
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:30,520
i was cleansed i was healed i was delivered i was sanctified i was redeemed my guilty

271
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:38,840
stains were washed away and i exchanged my brokenness and pain for his loving grace okay so

272
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:48,040
i'm confused do you eat dick now what's your deal jackie my deal is that i entered the throne room

273
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:54,120
with a repentant heart and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the father when i found jesus

274
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:02,040
i found someone who truly loves me and through obedience to him my identity is no longer in my

275
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:09,000
attractions but in christ you know what i think virginia i think that you are immoderate in love

276
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,760
and a moderate with substances and so you need an imaginary father figure to make all the rules

277
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:20,200
because you can't control yourself but your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else should

278
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,080
have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy mental infancy bondage to the flesh

279
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:38,520
is mental infancy i know justin the chains of sin i know the murmuring complaints of the flesh the itch the ache the shame and ill秒

280
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:46,060
I lived in mud. I lived in filth. I know the thorns, the seething cauldron, the great whirlwind

281
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:52,760
that whips sinners round an endless wheel of pain. But my shame was hammered to the cross

282
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:58,340
for those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.

283
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:08,420
Virginia, who are you trying to impress with this ostentatious sexual anorexia? Who is the

284
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:14,120
beneficiary of your erotic constipation? God? I really don't think he cares, Gorge.

285
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,940
Celibacy is not a good deed. To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say that you're gay

286
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:25,660
and you hate yourself. I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.

287
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,620
Is it hate to worship the glory of God over the glory of self? Where's my nail? Is it hate to be

288
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,740
anchored to the Savior's will that leads me from temptation? Damn it. To walk with purpose,

289
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,400
abide by God's will? Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.

290
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:45,260
Abiding in the identity of who God made me? Is it hate to heal the brokenness and be made whole

291
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:50,920
through radical obedience to the Holy Spirit? Have you been made whole, Virginia? Because to me,

292
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,420
it sounds like you amputate half of your own soul and you call it sin and shame. Well,

293
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,100
that's my definition of sexual brokenness. Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrato?

294
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:07,760
She's hilarious. She's a wit. We are all half angel and half beast.

295
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:14,760
The flesh must die so the spirit may live. The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.

296
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:21,920
Have you really wandered so far astray? Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of

297
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:27,920
Sodom that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul? No, Virginia, that's not what I think.

298
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:34,420
What I think is that you have a vulgar, cracker-barrel understanding of human sexuality

299
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,420
and you're on a save-the-children type moral crusade.

300
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,920
Because you lack the adult capacity to face the demons in your own head.

301
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:49,480
You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation. Well, what even is that, Virginia?

302
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:56,720
I want specifics. What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're gonna do if Jesus stops

303
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,900
holding your hand for 10 minutes? What? You think you're gonna rail a line of hype off a stripper's

304
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,740
tits? Excuse me? Answer this. What do you think erotic love is a design?

305
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:19,740
For? Wait, I know this one. Sex. No, that's too easy. Erotic love is not aimless pleasure-seeking.

306
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:29,060
It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness, to traverse the lonely void that

307
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:37,280
separates us from each other, to liberate repressed energy, to feel alive. Love is not the flesh.

308
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,880
It's not temptation. It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face. It's nothing like

309
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:52,640
being an alcoholic. It's not a craving. It's a yearning. The desire for reunion with our other

310
00:24:52,640 --> 00:25:00,860
half, Aristophanes. But you people don't understand that. Because you are vulgarians. You

311
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:06,020
have no sense of humanity. And you have no sense of the erotic. Well, that sounds like a bunch of

312
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,500
liberal,

313
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,200
liberal,

314
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,700
liberal,

315
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,840
sexist bullcrap.

316
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:16,460
Jackie, your brain is so small. It's just so tiny. Look at me.

317
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:21,320
You're a dum-dum. Okay? And I'm gonna need you to stop talking.

318
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:27,180
As usual, the cancel culture woke stoppo is trying to silence me.

319
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:33,800
Shh, Jackie. I really am trying to silence you this time. Because you're so stupid. And I can't

320
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,660
stand it anymore. So shut up.

321
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,140
I'm giving you the bullshit.

322
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:44,900
giving you the plague liberal okay well i hope it kills me because i'm done see i'll never get sick

323
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:51,300
because every day i drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication doctors don't want you to

324
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:57,300
know about it i could not possibly be more done you may be done but i'm not well you people never

325
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:04,100
are are you you want to talk about yearning i mean i get it i used to live in shame i know the

326
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,620
insatiable longing to be with another woman yes we've all noticed let me tell you it is not

327
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:17,940
freedom it is bondage you do not possess the flesh justin tableau the flesh possesses you rebuke it

328
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:26,260
and be free or perish as a slave for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life

329
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:33,220
and christ jesus our lord you people do love to rebuke things don't you justin the love you yearn

330
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,060
for can only be found in the sacrifice reward of your own blood jesus our lord you people do love to rebuke things don't you justin the love you yearn for can only

331
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:42,360
be found in Jesus. Only he can fill the void. I know. I used to be like you, Justin. I was lost.

332
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,280
I was blind. I was confused in my identity. I used to reject the gospel until my sin took

333
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:55,280
everything from me and I needed a savior. And then I called out to God for salvation

334
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:03,400
and he came to me as a loving father. It's not too late for you, Justin. You are so loved.

335
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:11,200
God loves you. But this? This is not God's intent for you. It is ridiculous to me that

336
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,220
you think you know God's intent. The height of cosmological narcissism. I'm sorry,

337
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:21,900
has Reddit gone offline? Have we run out of fedoras in America? I'm just trying to

338
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:25,940
understand why you hate God. I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.

339
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:34,020
God is love. Is he? The only love worth having. What you call love. The sin I used to live in.

340
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:40,860
The world, the flesh, and the devil. That only ever brought me pain. Yes, because heartbreak is

341
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:49,840
painful. Love is painful. The poets are unanimous. Love is bittersweet, says Sappho. Eros, giver of

342
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:55,960
pain. What's Sappho? A pagan pornographer. The sort of filth these people want to teach to

343
00:27:55,960 --> 00:28:01,700
children. Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is, then goddammit,

344
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,620
I don't know who can.

345
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:11,740
God for one. God has a sexual plan for all of us. That's hot. God's plan is for male and female to

346
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:18,060
be one flesh. Men's and women's bodies fit together for the purpose of creating children.

347
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:23,700
You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right? Seminal fluids are not difficult

348
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:30,060
to come by, even in this economy. You have a guy? A semen guy? That's just most guys.

349
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:34,040
Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics, but-

350
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,960
Since I'm among heathens, clearly, I will do my best to argue not from faith,

351
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:47,700
but from reason. I love reason. Do you? Tell me this, Justin, which is better? A love that is

352
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:54,160
eternal, or a love that can be ripped away at any moment? I'm sorry your girlfriend left you,

353
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:58,200
that must have been really hard. Just answer the question. Nothing is eternal, Virginia.

354
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,100
Except maybe sanctimonious assholes. Isn't a love that is eternal,

355
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:10,760
superior to a love that is fleeting? Yes, Socrates, it is certain. And don't you yearn?

356
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:17,700
Not just for a love in the moment, but for a love that lasts eternity? Yes, Socrates,

357
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:28,560
that is evident. And isn't eternal love what we call God? Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,

358
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,480
but sometimes we don't get what we want.

359
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,000
So you have-

360
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:36,100
I have no argument.

361
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,160
Do I really need an argument?

362
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:42,500
This is just a semantic trick. You're saying that God is eternal love, and then

363
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:47,060
magically that must exist because you defined it that way?

364
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:52,360
So you don't have an argument? I'm sorry.

365
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:52,980
Interesting.

366
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:57,480
I didn't prepare to have a debate about neoplatonism with a five-alarm lesbo

367
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:03,720
cosplaying as a trad wife. I'm supposed to take this seriously? Why? Why am I even here? What am

368
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:09,680
I doing? Why am I talking to these people? I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.

369
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:16,180
I don't think God leads people to podcasts. Clearly, this transgender identity of yours

370
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:23,440
is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside. There's a hunger in your soul. No pleasure

371
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:31,380
of the flesh can satisfy. Do you not feel the thirst in your body like a parched land? Well,

372
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:33,660
yeah, I feel the thirst.

373
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,400
I'm sure we all feel the thirst.

374
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,160
If I may quote Psalm 63.

375
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,040
Please don't.

376
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:46,400
You, God, are my God. Earnestly, I seek you. I thirst for you. My whole being longs for you

377
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:53,800
in a dry and parched land where there is no water. Because your love is better than life.

378
00:30:54,380 --> 00:31:02,720
My lips will glorify you. I will praise you as long as I live. And in your name, I will raise up

379
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,680
my hands.

380
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:12,760
I will be fully satisfied as in the richest of foods. With singing lips, my mouth will praise you.

381
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:20,800
Virginia, go to therapy, says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman. You're the one who needs

382
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:26,660
to go to therapy. No, you go to therapy. I'll pray for you. I'll pray for you. I will pray

383
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:33,120
straight to Satan. Look, can't we just agree that we are all a little Looney Tunes? You have your

384
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:41,000
Jesus bullshit. You have your gender nonsense. And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.

385
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:48,620
The free market. Right. We all have our little delusions. The important thing is that we cling

386
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:54,900
to them. And we never let go, no matter how much evidence gets in the way. Because that's what

387
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:02,520
makes us free. And freedom is what makes America great. Other countries, they don't have choices.

388
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:10,740
But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want. So can we do drugs? No,

389
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:15,580
that's illegal. I thought you said we could choose. Yes, but we have to make the right

390
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:21,260
choices. And what if we want to make the wrong choices? Well, the boot of the law will crush

391
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:27,120
you without mercy. You will be locked in a tiny cage. That is literally the opposite of freedom.

392
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:32,820
Well, we have to be tough on crime. It's the only way to keep this country free. We have to build,

393
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,100
rina.

394
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,000
more prisons. Who decides what the right and wrong choices are? Well, father decides. Father

395
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:46,400
always decides. And do you always do what father says? Of course, we always do what father says.

396
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,920
Why? Because father says so. Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep

397
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:58,800
with men? Oh, I don't want to sleep with men. Yes, you do. You're a man who struggles with gender

398
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:05,380
confusion and same-sex temptation. No, I'm not. I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl. My heart was

399
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:13,100
also broken by a woman. I thought she was a cat girl. She turned out to be a fuck boy. You are a

400
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:20,740
straight man. I mean, at this point, I wish. But no, definitely a gay woman. We're all stuck with it.

401
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:28,380
Hold on. So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman. Does that mean you're attracted

402
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:28,780
to your...

403
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:29,940
Self? No.

404
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,220
In the mirror?

405
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,420
No, because I'm not a fucking animal that can't tell the difference between my own reflection

406
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:42,720
and a different person. Desire is always for something that you lack. You can't desire

407
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:50,680
yourself because you're already one with yourself. Desire feeds on absence. It reaches out across

408
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:55,960
a void. I don't know. I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.

409
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,660
Okay. Well, thank you for sharing.

410
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:06,380
Aren't a lot of serial killers transgender? Do you have bodies in your basement? You better watch

411
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:11,620
out or you're gonna be next. Are those clothes even yours? Or are you wearing the clothes of

412
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:18,540
your victims? Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver, and I will feast upon

413
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:25,460
it. Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts. It's not enough for

414
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:28,660
you to possess a woman. You also have to appropriate female...

415
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:33,580
...female beauty for yourself. Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia? You're the

416
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,120
one who keeps bringing that up. Nice. Got her!

417
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,980
Shut up, dum-dum. I said it to hurt her, not to entertain you. You stay out of this.

418
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:48,120
Look, so you're a straight man. You could've had a wife. You could've raised a family.

419
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:52,820
Your life could've meant something. But you threw it all away? You really think having

420
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:58,440
babies is the only way to have a meaningful life? Do you have babies? Well, priests don't

421
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,100
have babies. Maybe think of queer people as priests. Except, you know, the people we

422
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:09,520
have sex with are adults. Whoa! Okay. That's Catholics. That's not Christians. It's kind

423
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,080
of crossing a line, don't you think? Oh, has free speech gone too far? Now it's gone too

424
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:21,140
far? Can we have a civil conversation, please? Is it impossible to have a civil conversation

425
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:26,400
in America today? Well, that ship has sailed and sunk. Virginia, I believe you are about

426
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,400
to exercise Christian humility by... ...having sex with a woman. I don't know. I don't know.

427
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

428
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:32,220
want to hear you 심erely explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more

429
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:40,560
meaningful than mine. I walk with the spirit until I go to glory. That's my meaning. Your

430
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:47,520
meaning...is what? To fabricate an already-fading illusion of feminine beauty until you rot

431
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:55,080
away unresurrected in the earth? And for what? To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?

432
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,740
Anything else would be a lie.

433
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:04,260
exists I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours and with or without your approval and understanding

434
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:13,920
I will always be the way I am look can't we reach a reasonable compromise I think you should have

435
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:23,360
the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into just leave children out of it like whatever

436
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:31,760
this is keep this away from children and that's why we should increase police funding to fight

437
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:48,860
the war on drugs I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are I know my

438
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:52,880
place in this world I've found a love family

439
00:36:53,360 --> 00:37:02,400
belonging fellowship in the church have you found fellowship in the lgbt2a dollar sign community

440
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:10,400
well obviously not because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other case in point though

441
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:18,320
you are one of the worst I've ever seen so you're alone you're far from God's grace and you have

442
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,280
no cat girl gf can you honestly say that you're happy

443
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:23,340
you're far from God's grace and you have no cat girl gf can you honestly say that you're happy

444
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:30,460
that you're fulfilled that you have purpose that you have

445
00:37:53,340 --> 00:38:04,060
still you're reliable and open and the way you seem and the reason for being here so

446
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:08,380
that you just be loved is

447
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:18,540
beautiful you say roll over surrender

448
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,500
for me

449
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,700
impressive

450
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,200
right

451
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:23,440
Hello?

452
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,040
Jesus.

453
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,440
Don't say that name in front of me.

454
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,920
How did you get in my house?

455
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,020
Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.

456
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,840
Who are you?

457
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,320
What are you?

458
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,660
Well, I used to be an angel.

459
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,300
And now?

460
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:51,320
Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.

461
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,820
A satanic visitation.

462
00:38:54,340 --> 00:39:00,600
At this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the country, localized entirely within my bathroom?

463
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,860
Yes.

464
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,280
Is this going to be a weird sex thing?

465
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,500
Do you want it to be?

466
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,220
No.

467
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,140
Look, I've had a terrible day.

468
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,860
I'm really not in the mood for this.

469
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,240
Well, I can help you with that.

470
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,480
Can you?

471
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,620
Sure.

472
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,200
I can help with anything.

473
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,720
Depression, anxiety, insomnia.

474
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:26,920
Pain, boredom, failure, shame.

475
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,340
Shame?

476
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,340
Is it the shame?

477
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,000
Well, yeah, there's the shame.

478
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,660
There's always going to be the shame.

479
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,640
But it's a complex cocktail.

480
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,560
There's the heartbreak.

481
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,440
There's the loneliness, the self-loathing.

482
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,500
I'm a parched land, Luce.

483
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,640
I've got the hunger, the emptiness inside.

484
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,340
Oh, emptiness inside.

485
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,220
Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.

486
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:50,900
Let me fill you up.

487
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,300
Let me fill you up.

488
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:54,600
I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.

489
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,220
It's not a weird sex thing.

490
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,680
Potions, Justine.

491
00:39:59,340 --> 00:39:59,940
Potions.

492
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:03,460
I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.

493
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:05,280
Potions?

494
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,340
Elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.

495
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:12,840
Think of me as a salesman.

496
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,720
An apothecary.

497
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:16,300
A dealer.

498
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,680
Are you trying to get demonetized?

499
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:20,720
Sorry.

500
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,320
What potions do you have?

501
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,320
Well, this is one of my favorites.

502
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,320
It's called hype.

503
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,320
This will make you come alive.

504
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,320
You'll jump right out of your shell.

505
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,320
Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.

506
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,320
You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.

507
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,320
You'll finally get things done.

508
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,320
You'll connect with people.

509
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:50,320
You'll always know just what to say.

510
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.

511
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:58,320
At this point, I just want the pain to stop.

512
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
Pain?

513
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Well, I surely have something for that.

514
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,320
It's called void.

515
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:12,320
One drop of this and all the pain will melt away.

516
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,320
The aches of the body.

517
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,320
The agitation of desire.

518
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,320
The sting of heartbreak.

519
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,320
Boredom.

520
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,320
Grief.

521
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,320
And shame.

522
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:30,320
All of that will fade away under a warm blanket of serenity and love.

523
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Yes, I know what void is.

524
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
But that's a very hard potion.

525
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,320
And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.

526
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,320
Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.

527
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,320
You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness?

528
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,320
All alone?

529
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:54,320
What, do you need a clear mind to process how bad you were on that podcast?

530
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
Because it was embarrassing.

531
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
Humiliating, honestly.

532
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
It was difficult to watch.

533
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,320
Shut up.

534
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Is it some kind of masochism?

535
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,320
You just want to feel all the pain, man?

536
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
Because you're not impressing anyone.

537
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,320
I mean, what is your plan for this evening?

538
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,320
You're going to sit around stalking your ex on social media all night?

539
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,320
Because that is pathetic.

540
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,320
And it's so unnecessary.

541
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,320
Because you're choosing to feel bad.

542
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:23,320
When with one drop of void, you can be in bliss.

543
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Pass.

544
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,320
The cool kids are doing it.

545
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,320
The cool kids are absolutely not doing it.

546
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,320
Because it's not the 90s.

547
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Kids today are vaping Benadryl.

548
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,320
Don't you keep up with this?

549
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Okay, I mean, I respect your choice.

550
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,320
But I'm not going anywhere.

551
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,320
I will stay right here.

552
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:54,320
And I will remind you every minute for hundreds of consecutive minutes that your pain is optional.

553
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:57,320
And I have the antidote right here.

554
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,320
But I guess you'd just rather feel pain.

555
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,320
And shame.

556
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,320
And humiliation.

557
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:07,320
And heartbreak.

558
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,320
And boredom.

559
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Loneliness.

560
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Despair.

561
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:16,320
Disappointment.

562
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
Failure.

563
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,320
Anguish.

564
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,320
Frustration.

565
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:25,320
Look, I'm a smart person, okay?

566
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:29,320
And I'm not going to let you turn me into some kind of pathetic junkie.

567
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:31,320
Pathetic?

568
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:35,320
Is it pathetic to feel good?

569
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.

570
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,320
And to me,

571
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,320
that's pathetic.

572
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Well, the thing about that...

573
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,320
Okay, just give me the cocktail void.

574
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.

575
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,320
I thought I was going to be here all night.

576
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,320
Well, my will is weak, okay?

577
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,320
Can I have the potion, please?

578
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,320
Alright, well, let's be a little patient.

579
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,320
You should really do this the right way, okay?

580
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,320
It's called harm reduction.

581
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:12,320
What you're going to do is put one drop,

582
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,320
and only one drop,

583
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,320
of pure void into water.

584
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,320
This is important.

585
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:22,320
Do not do too many drops.

586
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
What happens if I do too many drops?

587
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,320
Oh, you'll probably die.

588
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,320
I'll die?

589
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,320
I told you it was important.

590
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,320
Well, how many drops is too many drops?

591
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:34,320
Well, it's difficult to say exactly.

592
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
It depends on a lot of factors.

593
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:37,320
Seriously?

594
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
But it's your first time.

595
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:40,320
So just do one.

596
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,320
So, do I just drink it, or...

597
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Of course you drink it.

598
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,320
It's a purely fictional magical potion

599
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,320
utterly disconnected from any real-world social issues.

600
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,320
What else would you do with it?

601
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,320
Okay.

602
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:12,320
Good girl.

603
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,320
I don't feel anything.

604
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
Okay, well, give it a minute.

605
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,320
In about 15 seconds,

606
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,320
you are not going to know the meaning of the word pain.

607
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,320
Are you ready for that?

608
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,320
Lucy,

609
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:25,320
I have never been more ready for anything

610
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,320
in my god damn life.

611
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,320
There she goes.

612
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,320
Thank god!

613
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,320
Well don't thank god, thank me.

614
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,320
I will not have a father taking credit for my work.

615
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,320
Ahhhhh.

616
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
The Thin Sleeves

617
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,320
Boyfriend

618
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:29,300
To be continued...

619
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:50,380
Lucy? Lucy? Luciferia? Mother? A doctor? Mother-doctor? Doctor-mother? Mom? Mother-void? Mother-void?

620
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:52,520
Yes?

621
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,060
Help me, Doctor. I'm being cancelled.

622
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,300
Oh, no.

623
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:03,180
So a bunch of furries are mad at you online. So what?

624
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,680
You don't understand, Doctor. I'm in love with this furry.

625
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,560
You really are far from God. You're further from God than I am.

626
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:15,600
Lucy, can I get a drop?

627
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,620
A drop? I thought you didn't want to go down dark paths.

628
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,740
Doctor, my pain is at a ten.

629
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:28,920
I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again. I'm a little disappointed,

630
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,300
honestly. I enjoy the thrill of the chase. But there's no chase with you. No chase at all.

631
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:41,680
You're easy. An easy little void slut. A slut for the void.

632
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:48,580
Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy. Please, just give me the void so I can

633
00:47:48,580 --> 00:47:56,020
fill the emptiness. If it's the void you want, the void you shall have. But you don't call me Lucy

634
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,300
anymore, understand?

635
00:47:58,120 --> 00:47:58,340
Yes?

636
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:07,060
call me mommy now because I own you yes mommy dearest

637
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:55,840
you

638
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:28,320
Thank you.

639
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:34,220
Five drops already. Escalating, aren't we?

640
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:37,180
Well, yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.

641
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,920
So you're going to do five drops?

642
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:45,600
Just to take the edge off. I need five drops to take the edge off, so I'm going to do five drops.

643
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:53,060
Oh, wow. If it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument. By all means, continue.

644
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,540
Well, thank you for being supportive. Cheers.

645
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:28,320
Thank you.

646
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:30,340
Cheers.

647
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:08,880
That was dumb. That was so dumb.

648
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:15,380
Shit.

649
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:21,900
I need to quit.

650
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:26,400
I've got to quit. I'm going to quit.

651
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,860
Oh, you're going to quit, are you?

652
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,920
Yes, Mother. I'm going to quit. I just...

653
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:35,760
Good luck.

654
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:42,140
I'll quit after one more drop.

655
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:42,940
Of course.

656
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,940
All right, that's it. Never again.

657
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:54,420
I'm quitting.

658
00:51:57,620 --> 00:51:58,320
I quit.

659
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,000
I quit.

660
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,740
It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.

661
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:12,140
How hard could that be?

662
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:38,340
No. I can't do this. I can't do this.

663
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,720
Shit. Shit.

664
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:57,620
Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Lucy. Lucy!

665
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:03,340
Lucy, I'm with the flurry. Wake up, Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Wake up!

666
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,340
I'm with the flurry.

667
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,340
I'm with the flurry.

668
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:58,320
Thank you.

669
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:28,320
Thank you.

670
00:55:28,340 --> 00:55:58,320
Thank you.

671
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:28,320
Thank you.

672
00:56:28,340 --> 00:56:58,320
Thank you.

673
00:56:58,340 --> 00:57:28,320
Thank you.

674
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:33,440
Thank you.
