1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,640
Hello, my devilish darlings! It is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I'm here

2
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,640
to warn you that some viewers may find tonight's program disturbing. There will be discussion

3
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,580
of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime. Ugh. So if that's gonna

4
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:38,800
make you sad, please don't watch this. Unless you enjoy sadness. I know I do. But your macabre

5
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,500
mother wants you to take care of yourself, so here, I made you a wet pot of hot tea and

6
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,240
you can take it out on the balcony and pour it on some pedestrians. That always cheers

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,240
me up!

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:54,440
1. Traps

9
00:00:54,440 --> 00:01:03,400
Gentlemen of the Academy, it is my duty to submit to you the findings of my latest memetic

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:09,980
research. Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe, scrutinizing

11
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:17,720
volumes ancient and modern, in search of the answer to two fundamental questions. What

12
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,500
are traps? And be they gay?

13
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,420
With respect to the former inquiry, I adjure you that you will not be able to find any

14
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,420
answer to these questions.

15
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:31,660
2. A treatise by the lady scholar known as the pedantic Romantic, wherein the derivation

16
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,660
of the word trap is traced to patrons of animated pictures from the Orient.

17
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,660
Curious.

18
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:43,180
The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century, when devotees of picture

19
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:48,660
forums would proclaim the idiom, it's a trap, alongside the likeness of one Admiral

20
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,380
Akbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place.

21
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,380
3. Contemporaneous.

22
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:00,120
The most notorious to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic Japonesques,

23
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:05,720
to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined. The implication being

24
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,740
that the subject of the portrait was not in sooth a daughter of Eve, but rather that the

25
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:16,180
spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite skullduggery.

26
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:22,500
Furthermore, it appears that from the first, the designation trap has signified not only

27
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,220
transvestites, but transeptites.

28
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:31,240
And this must needs be remarked, for it is evident such persons ofttimes inflame the

29
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,000
lust of ordinary men.

30
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,300
It is hence with respect to this phenomenon I pose my second question thus. Fellas, is

31
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,300
it gay?

32
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,180
I'm sorry, who are you talking to?

33
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:51,220
Gentlemen of the Academy, did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again? It must needs be

34
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,220
remarked.

35
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
Please stop breaking into my room.

36
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,120
You don't want to enter my house?

38
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,560
I shall be the queen of dairy.

39
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,240
I'm sure you will be.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,340
Cross dresser!

41
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,340
Hi!

42
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,340
I'm Natalie Wynn.

43
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,060
Biological woman.

44
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,080
Can't we pan the camera down?

45
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,700
My hair is less high?

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,300
Are traps gay?

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,100
The meme that will not die.

48
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,180
Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male crossdresser

49
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,720
or a trans woman, especially in a context

50
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,680
of neotenous kawaii decadence.

51
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,020
The meme, are traps gay, is a mostly jokey debate

52
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,580
about the sexuality of men attracted to dick girls,

53
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,280
futanari, MTFs.

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,500
You know, a lot of these men don't know or care

55
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,000
about the difference between a trans woman

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,460
and a crossdresser, so it's kind of pointless

57
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,600
to get hung up on that.

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,900
The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago

59
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:47,660
when someone released the worst specimens

60
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,840
of the white race into the wild.

61
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,420
All traps gay.

62
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,280
One of life's most important questions.

63
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,040
Are traps gay?

64
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,600
Traps are gay, yes.

65
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:03,140
Will there be transsexuals in the ethnic state?

66
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:05,980
Hopefully not.

67
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,680
To the men who meme about this topic,

68
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,160
it's all lighthearted fun.

69
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,940
It's part of a wider game they like to play

70
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,040
called Is It Gay?

71
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,620
You know, is it gay to have an MMF threesome

72
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:16,180
only if the balls touch?

73
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,460
Don't cross the streams.

74
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,760
And so on.

75
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,780
But to many trans women, the meme and the word trap itself

76
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,940
are highly offensive.

77
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,900
In fact, last year when I first proposed

78
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,600
making a video about this topic,

79
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,680
many trans people on Twitter were outraged

80
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,080
because they felt that this topic

81
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,260
is just too harmful to even discuss.

82
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,620
So here's the challenge I face making this video.

83
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,700
On the one hand, there's people who are gonna be upset

84
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,480
and offended that I'm making a video about this topic at all.

85
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,380
And on the other hand, there are people who think

86
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,660
this is all just harmless otaku shit posting

87
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,840
and who are gonna be annoyed by my trigger warnings.

88
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,200
But first, to the people who think it's too offensive,

89
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,800
here's what I have to say for myself.

90
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,400
I've always believed that if you wanna persuade anyone,

91
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
it helps to meet them where they're at.

92
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,580
And in this case, rtrapsgay is where people are at.

93
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,740
At one of my YouTube meetups,

94
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,380
I met a high school teacher who told me

95
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,420
that he overheard some of his male students

96
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,740
joking in the hallway about rtrapsgay.

97
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,780
When those teenage boys go home and Google rtrapsgay,

98
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,380
who do you wanna explain it to them?

99
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,440
Your choices are Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy,

100
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,480
a Scottish hate crime convict named Count Dankula,

101
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,640
or this tran.

102
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,620
And at the risk of sounding arrogant,

103
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,220
I think it should be me.

104
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,200
You know, as trans women, we have little influence,

105
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,140
in society.

106
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,860
The people who lead the conversations about us

107
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:26,700
are bigger and stronger than we are,

108
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,200
so we're like a jogger racing against a car.

109
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,920
The only way to win is to hijack the car.

110
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:36,140
And so, this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation

111
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,580
that straight men are having about us.

112
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,960
As always, my aspiration is to derive a woke conclusion

113
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,200
from edgy premises,

114
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,740
to shitpost my way to the moral high ground.

115
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,700
Now, straight men, isn't all this offense taking

116
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,440
just more politically correct cuckoldry

117
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,200
designed to take away your free speech?

118
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,780
Well, I assure you, there will be no taking

119
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,300
of your free speech on this channel,

120
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:58,440
unless you clock my makeup, dickbag.

121
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,880
Comment deleted.

122
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:02,560
But, if you wanna know why trans women are offended

123
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,140
by Are Traps Gay?, I'm happy to tell you.

124
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,480
Not to silence you, of course,

125
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,760
but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity

126
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,800
to wanna know why someone different from you

127
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,560
might be hurt by something that seems harmless to you.

128
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,360
So, well, let's put it this way.

129
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,840
Two, trans panic.

130
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,360
The 1990 documentary, Paris is Burning,

131
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,860
depicts the ball culture of black and Latinx

132
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,980
gay and transgender people in New York City

133
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,480
in the late 1980s.

134
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,780
One of the main storylines follows a trans woman

135
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,600
named Venus Extravaganza,

136
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,920
who describes her precarious existence as a sex worker.

137
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,380
I was with a guy, and he was playing with my titties

138
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:44,440
till he touched me down there.

139
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,480
He felt it, and he seen it, and he like totally flipped out.

140
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,420
He said, you fucking faggot.

141
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,460
You're a freak.

142
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,880
You're a victim of AIDS,

143
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,200
and you're trying to give me AIDS.

144
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,060
What are you, crazy?

145
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,900
You're a homo.

146
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,000
I should kill you.

147
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,520
And like, I was really terrified,

148
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,560
so I just jumped out the window.

149
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,440
During the filming of Paris is Burning,

150
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,380
Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client.

151
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,320
Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed.

152
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,780
Trans women, in my country,

153
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,880
almost entirely trans women of color,

154
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,120
are murdered at a disgracefully high rate,

155
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,960
reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017.

156
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,180
The men who murder trans women often claim

157
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,640
they were provoked to violence

158
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,020
by alleged deception of their victims.

159
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,540
This is what's called the trans panic defense

160
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,980
when legally invoked,

161
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,460
as in the 2004 trial of the killers

162
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,960
of the teenage trans girl, Gwen Araujo.

163
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,820
One of the killers, who had sex with Gwen

164
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,220
before learning she was trans,

165
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,360
cried, I can't be fucking gay,

166
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,920
before beating her to death.

167
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,440
Men are often willing to side with these killers,

168
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:45,000
saying that if trans women don't want to get murdered,

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,960
then they shouldn't trick men.

170
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,220
But what you have to understand is,

171
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,060
first, men usually do know when they're having sex

172
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,900
with a trans woman.

173
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,280
Like, if you have a dick,

174
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,040
it's pretty hard, actually, to have sex with someone

175
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,540
and have them not notice it.

176
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:01,260
And second, a lot of men view trans women's entire existence

177
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,240
as itself a kind of trickery.

178
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,240
A black trans woman named Elan Nettles

179
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,140
was murdered in Harlem in 2013

180
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,300
by a man whose friends had mocked him for flirting with her.

181
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,060
All she did to provoke him

182
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,640
was walk down the street with two friends.

183
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,940
The common thread here is not deception

184
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,300
on the part of the victims,

185
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,960
but rather the drive of the killers to protect

186
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,640
their social standing as masculine and straight.

187
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,720
But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure

188
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,500
is something that many trans women across class and race

189
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,160
experience some version of,

190
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:36,000
because men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement,

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,920
as the orchidaceous invitation to a proboscis.

192
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,200
I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman

193
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,760
who was attacked recently by a man at a bar

194
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,060
who started flirting with her

195
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:49,000
until he realized she was trans and then punched her.

196
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,060
Like, what was she supposed to do

197
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,940
to stop that from happening?

198
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,380
Just stay at home?

199
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,420
For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us

200
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,620
for existing actually limit our freedom.

201
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,100
There's bars I won't go into

202
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:02,100
because I don't trust the clientele to side with me

203
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,160
if some shit like that goes down.

204
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,620
And I've had little scares.

205
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,120
I was in the back of an Uber once

206
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,540
and the driver comes on a little flirty, you know,

207
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,560
what's your name?

208
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,560
Are you a student?

209
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,980
And I'm thinking, wow,

210
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:15,420
he thinks I'm young enough to be a student.

211
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,220
But at some point he goes silent

212
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,940
and suddenly I'm getting a very icy glare

213
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:20,660
in the rear view mirror.

214
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,660
Like, fucking clocked.

215
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,580
And for a second I'm like, fuck,

216
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,660
I'm gonna die in the back of this car.

217
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,940
And of course I didn't die.

218
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:31,200
The rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine.

219
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,860
I mean, I'm gonna be fine

220
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,780
because white middle-class transsexuals

221
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:36,220
don't get murdered in this country.

222
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,860
The murder issue exists at a specific intersection

223
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,400
of gender, class, and race.

224
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,520
And it's really not my oppression to claim.

225
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,840
You know, I sometimes hear white, bougie, middle-class,

226
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,880
computer programmer trans women be like,

227
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,380
we're getting murdered in the streets.

228
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,300
Who's we?

229
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,340
It's not white middle-class trans women.

230
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,400
So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane.

231
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,360
It exists at this intersection of masculinity and race.

232
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,000
And it's really not a conversation

233
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,600
that should be led by a white woman,

234
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,960
especially when there's so, so, so many things

235
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,200
to critique about white masculinity.

236
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,540
Let's talk about some now.

237
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,020
Three, taking offense.

238
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,980
Okay, back to traps.

239
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,800
Now this is my lane.

240
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,900
I'm not sure anything's ever been more my lane.

241
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,100
Ah, the exquisite pleasure of being

242
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,320
entitled to the soapbox.

243
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,540
So boys, I've showed you how trans women's freedom

244
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:28,320
is abridged by our need to navigate around men

245
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,820
who view our gender presentation,

246
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,440
in fact, our very existence, as a kind of trap.

247
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,440
I think it should therefore be pretty clear

248
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,740
why trans women are not the biggest fans

249
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,140
of you using that word for us,

250
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:41,740
or for Fudanari, or cross-dressers, or whatever.

251
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,360
I mean, to be honest, if someone calls me a trap,

252
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,380
my response is more like, wow,

253
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,740
a transphobe thought I looked like a woman.

254
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,240
But that's because I'm so pathetic,

255
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,260
I have to go dumpster diving for validation.

256
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:54,100
But the rest of the trans women out there,

257
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,360
the ones with dignity and self-respect,

258
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,340
you should definitely not call them traps.

259
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,460
Of course, some trans women will overstate the case

260
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,140
and say the word trap is literally getting trans women killed,

261
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,180
which, I can't find any examples of the word trap

262
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,720
being connected to a murder,

263
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,540
but why don't we stop using the word before someone dies?

264
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,160
Because what you're doing when you call trans women traps

265
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,760
is you're showing that you think of us

266
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,180
the exact same way as the men

267
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,140
who try to justify attacking us.

268
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,960
When a man kills a trans woman,

269
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,240
literally the argument he trots out in court

270
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,540
is that he was trapped.

271
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,360
And that's what you're reminding us of

272
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,900
when you use that word.

273
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,340
And that's why trans women are getting triggered over it.

274
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,200
You know, sometimes people have good reasons

275
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,600
for being triggered by things,

276
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,640
and this is one of those times.

277
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,300
So, if I were a different kind of creator,

278
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,780
I could really end this video now.

279
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,860
I think I've made a pretty convincing case

280
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:45,120
that trans women are justifiably offended by the word trap.

281
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,020
But if I leave it at that, and this is for you, Twitter,

282
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:50,080
this is why I'm making this video.

283
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,300
If I simply argue that are traps gay is offensive,

284
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:54,600
then here's what happens.

285
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,260
First, a lot of people simply don't give a shit.

286
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,800
In fact, me telling them it's offensive

287
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,460
only makes them wanna say it more,

288
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,100
because they feel on a deep level

289
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,700
that they are by nature superior to trans people.

290
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,960
So an uppity telling them what words

291
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,320
they're allowed to say completely enrages them.

292
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,460
So they'll comment, traps are gay, lol,

293
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,780
just to reaffirm their superiority over me

294
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,100
and that I have no power or influence over them.

295
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,020
And there's really nothing I can do about those,

296
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:18,860
trans people.

297
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,980
But another group of people,

298
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,960
the socially progressive liberals,

299
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,860
they'll say, okay, so since you're offended by it,

300
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,520
I won't say the word trap anymore.

301
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,040
And they'll be super woke about it,

302
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,380
and they'll post Twitter call-outs

303
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,420
canceling anyone who uses the word trap,

304
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,820
and they'll be very respectful and compassionate

305
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,640
toward trans people in public,

306
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,960
so long as it makes them look good

307
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,020
to indulge and pity this tragic third-world country

308
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,060
of a gender minority.

309
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,360
But then they'll go home at night,

310
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,020
and in that twilight between consciousness and sleep,

311
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,980
their inner voice will whisper, but are traps gay?

312
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,580
And then, years later,

313
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,240
when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend,

314
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,140
we'll suddenly watch all that shallow wokeness vanish

315
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,280
like so much politically correct vapor.

316
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,200
Real acceptance has to be built on real understanding.

317
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,880
So it's not enough for me to argue

318
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,400
that are traps gay is offensive.

319
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:14,400
I also have to argue whether traps are gay.

320
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,860
So are traps gay?

321
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,860
Let's watch this.

322
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,220
Watch an instructional video to learn more.

323
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:37,840
Four, the philosopher.

324
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,020
Hello, boys.

325
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,960
It is I, the half-queen, points.

326
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,000
After 30 days and 30 nights,

327
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,860
the philosopher descended from the mountain

328
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,860
on top and to the gathered villagers thus spake.

329
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,460
Are traps gay, said he,

330
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:56,400
to whom the half-queen thus replied.

331
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,960
Hmm, let's see.

332
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,320
Let me think about it.

333
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,160
Oh.

334
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm gonna stop saying trap now

335
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,640
because it's not a good word, as has been explained.

336
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,440
In fact, it's really best to treat it like a slur.

337
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,960
So what we're really asking here is if a man is attracted to

338
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,620
or has sex with a trans woman, is that gay?

339
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,800
Well, the simple answer is no, because trans women are,

340
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:21,200
and a man having sex with a woman is,

341
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,600
let's see here, according to the experts I've consulted,

342
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,140
it is not in fact gay.

343
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,800
But that's not the most persuasive answer

344
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
because in order to find it convincing,

345
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,600
you already have to believe that trans women are women.

346
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,520
And unfortunately, if you ask the average person about this,

347
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,040
what they say is something like,

348
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,740
sure, I think trans women are women,

349
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,680
but they shouldn't expect men to wanna date them

350
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,020
unless they're into that sort of thing.

351
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,560
Oh, and what sort of thing is that?

352
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,780
Usually when a man tells you he's dating a woman

353
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,240
and you say, oh, what's she like?

354
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,280
And he says, she's from Cincinnati,

355
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,640
your response is not, oh, David,

356
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,420
I didn't realize you were into that sort of thing.

357
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,360
In other words, these people tell you trans women are women,

358
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,220
but, and then they say something that shows

359
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:13,480
they don't really think trans women are women at all.

360
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,740
So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point,

361
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:19,640
it would basically be circular reasoning for me

362
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,560
to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn't gay

363
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,500
because trans women are women,

364
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,240
since the womanhood of trans women

365
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,800
is precisely the point that's being disputed.

366
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,160
So maybe the observational approach is better.

367
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,100
The facts are indisputable.

368
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,920
Many heterosexual men are attracted to trans women

369
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,940
and comparatively few gay men are.

370
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:40,680
Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact

371
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,700
about our everyday experience in the world.

372
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,600
We know who's attracted to us and who isn't.

373
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,420
So to us,

374
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:49,580
this completely unnecessary debate is as impractical

375
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,400
as the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow.

376
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,160
Sure, philosophers can say,

377
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,100
but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow?

378
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,020
To which the correct response is shut the fuck up, nerd.

379
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,080
Stop playing 3D chess against your own brain

380
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,840
and find a real thing to worry about.

381
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,560
It's just a basic fact of experience

382
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,000
that the sun rises every morning.

383
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,920
And to trans women, it's a basic fact of experience

384
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,680
that the people who are attracted to us

385
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,900
are people who are attracted to women.

386
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,160
Of the cis men I've been with

387
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,740
since I started my transition,

388
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,400
all identify as straight

389
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,360
and all had only ever been with cis women

390
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,280
until this trend came along.

391
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,400
Am I really so powerful as a seductress

392
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,760
that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay

393
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,340
over these tiny tits?

394
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,520
Let's not get cocky.

395
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,420
I mean, if a man is attracted to women and not to men

396
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,900
and he perceives me as a woman

397
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,620
and is attracted to me as a woman

398
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,780
and he sleeps with me

399
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:41,000
and then he continues being attracted to women

400
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,240
and not to men,

401
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,680
in what world is that anything but a straight man?

402
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,580
What wild maze of reasoning do you have

403
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,900
to invent to argue that this man is really gay?

404
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,580
Well, we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes,

405
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,000
beginning with the obvious.

406
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,340
What about the penis?

407
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,480
Ah, yes, the penis.

408
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:58,920
Look, baby, we'll get to the penis.

409
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,300
Don't you worry about that.

410
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,000
But first, I should remind everyone

411
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,140
that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas

412
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,760
because they got five.

413
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:07,600
The surgery.

414
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,800
In fact, I've been thinking of signing up

415
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,120
for a vagina myself,

416
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,860
but the thing is I make too much money for Medicaid now,

417
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,680
so I have to form an LLC,

418
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,780
become my own employer so I can give myself health benefits,

419
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,620
and ugh, it's so much paperwork.

420
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,720
You have to become an unincorporated legal entity

421
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
in this country just to get a .

422
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,660
Of course, transphobic radical feminists will say

423
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,920
it's not a real vagina, just a fuckhole,

424
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,880
because a real vagina is a sacred passage.

425
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,080
And that's fine by me.

426
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,240
What am I gonna do with a sacred passage anyway?

427
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,680
Get fingered by the Pope?

428
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,520
Pass.

429
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,300
Straight men don't get hung up on this.

430
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,620
I guarantee you no straight man has ever thought

431
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,240
of a vagina as a sacred passage.

432
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,900
They're either grossed out by it

433
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,320
or they're trying to climb inside.

434
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,000
What I'm trying to say is in the past,

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,360
I've been a little uncertain about getting a vagina

436
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,520
because my genital dysphoria isn't that bad.

437
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,640
And besides, chicks with dicks are very in right now,

438
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,360
very 2019, very trending.

439
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,600
And being a dick girl,

440
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,000
it's kind of like being a legendary Pokemon, you know?

441
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,440
People take interest, people pay attention to you,

442
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,940
and isn't that what we all want?

443
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,280
But unfashionable though it is,

444
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,020
I do think I want the surgery because,

445
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:14,260
well, guys, can I confess something kind of dark to you?

446
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,140
I have this really, really, really, really, really,

447
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,280
really fucked up fetish

448
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,080
where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina.

449
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:22,200
Crazy, right?

450
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,160
I mean, I like anal,

451
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,780
but the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well.

452
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,200
Ew, I don't want to eat well.

453
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,560
I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get dicked.

454
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,740
Is that a crime?

455
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,120
It is kind of a scary surgery though.

456
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,720
Like what if my vagina sucks?

457
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,440
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

458
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,360
The tests are back and are showing that

459
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,440
in the medical terminology, your vagina does indeed suck.

460
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,740
The point is the easy sell version of the argument I'm making

461
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:47,180
is that there's nothing homosexual about a man's attraction

462
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,860
to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years.

463
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,400
She has female skin, she smells like a woman,

464
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,140
she has breasts, she's giving hair, body, face,

465
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,980
she's post-op and has a vagina.

466
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:59,140
Now even in this situation, people will still say

467
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:00,960
it's gay because of the chromosomes.

468
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,500
But look, human beings have five senses

469
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,740
and none of them can detect chromosomes.

470
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,320
Sexual attraction is not based

471
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,440
on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender.

472
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,920
It's based on perception.

473
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:13,620
And if you're a man and you perceive someone as a woman

474
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,680
and you're attracted to her

475
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,580
as a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment,

476
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,420
my dude.

477
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,900
Congratulations, you're a breeder.

478
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,420
Now the argument people make is, okay, fine.

479
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,600
It's straight if you mistake her for a biological woman.

480
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,940
But if you know she's a man and you're still attracted,

481
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,520
then it's gay.

482
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,040
So look, if you believe that trans women are men,

483
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,740
then that belief might interfere with your perceptions

484
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,380
and it might change the relationship

485
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,740
between your perceptions and your sexual response.

486
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,680
But more likely is that you still will feel attraction

487
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,800
to the trans woman.

488
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,560
Only if you value your identity as a straight man,

489
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,480
you'll feel ashamed of your attraction

490
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,040
and you'll try to fight and deny it.

491
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,040
And you'll probably end up treating trans women

492
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,520
like absolute garbage.

493
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,900
Now, if I wanted to make the SJW 101 type response here,

494
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,940
I would say trans women are women

495
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,780
because they identify as women.

496
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:04,280
And so every heterosexual man who's experiencing attraction

497
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,880
to a trans woman is necessarily experiencing

498
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,580
heterosexual attraction because of the way

499
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,380
the person he's attracted to identifies.

500
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,340
But that's just replacing the black and white male and female

501
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,720
with the black and white thinking of a biology dogma

502
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,220
with the black and white thinking of an identity dogma.

503
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,940
But human sexuality is not black and white.

504
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,480
It's not even shades of gray.

505
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,160
It's a multicolor acid trip.

506
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,500
It's centaur Donna Summer charging at you

507
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,620
with a spanking paddle.

508
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:30,340
So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes,

509
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,760
but it's not usually based on psychological identity either.

510
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,140
Most of the time, initial attraction anyway

511
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:38,360
is based on what I'd call presentation,

512
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,640
how you look and act.

513
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,380
And I think that's especially true of men.

514
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,140
They get turned on by that initial visual pull,

515
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:43,980
pop.

516
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,280
They see, they conquer, they come.

517
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,040
I mean, you have to admire the simplicity of it.

518
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,260
Sometimes I wish I were a man.

519
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,500
So look, if what you want is a woman who pops,

520
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,240
then rest assured there are plenty of trans women who pop.

521
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,760
Maybe you don't think I pop,

522
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,180
but you'd be hard pressed to argue

523
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:01,420
that any number of trans models and actresses

524
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,840
don't pop as much as any cis woman pops.

525
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,380
So the pop is undeniable.

526
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,960
No one's questioning the pop.

527
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,120
In fact, without the pop,

528
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,300
it never would have occurred to men

529
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,860
to call trans women traps

530
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,380
because they wouldn't be trapped

531
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,700
if they weren't attracted in the first place.

532
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,700
But a lot of men seem to think that the pop,

533
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,100
the visual presentation of a trans woman,

534
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,260
is some kind of illusion or facade

535
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,040
that at some point will be dropped,

536
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,000
revealing that our womanhood is a sham

537
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,200
and that we're really men.

538
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,820
Now, here's a big difference

539
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,060
between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen.

540
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,800
If you date a cis drag queen,

541
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,220
at some point, you're getting a man, honey,

542
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,260
as explained by the only good YouTuber, Jasmine Masters.

543
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,780
I don't wanna date nobody who wanna date me like this

544
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,800
because this comes off,

545
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,220
and you're not doing nothing with this.

546
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,180
But if you date me, there's no de-dragging.

547
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,160
There's no moment where I become a man.

548
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,700
Baby, what you see is what you got.

549
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,540
At least on this side.

550
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,040
This is my natural side,

551
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,820
and this is my biological side.

552
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,240
When we're discussing people who are trans,

553
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,060
we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman

554
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,120
and then refer to them by their biological pronoun

555
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,020
because biology is the nature of the pronoun, so.

556
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,620
Everyone's always hating on trans women

557
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,740
for being stereotypically feminine,

558
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,480
so why do you think that in the bedroom

559
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,740
we'd be any other way?

560
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,140
Part of it is that people are really,

561
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,220
really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy

562
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,640
and what it does for trans women.

563
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,880
It feminizes our skin, our smell,

564
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,340
our body fat distribution.

565
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,860
It makes us grow breasts.

566
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,040
That's right, these are my very real,

567
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,100
very biological titties.

568
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,200
I mean, I'm wearing a push-up bra,

569
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,980
but at least there's something to push up now.

570
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,320
Here, I'll show you.

571
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:31,920
I mean, they're small,

572
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,260
but it's not by any measure a male chest,

573
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,940
and what I have is very real,

574
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,800
very biological, and very female.

575
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:41,420
You people think everything to do with trans women is fake,

576
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,920
it's fake boobs, fake hair,

577
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,000
but that's prejudice more than observation.

578
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
Like, I've noticed that whether or not

579
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,420
I actually wear a wig in a video

580
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,540
has exactly zero effect on how many people comment

581
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,880
to call me a man in a wig,

582
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,480
so I may as well just wear wigs,

583
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,860
and I may as well get my boobs done, too,

584
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,800
since people are gonna call them fake either way,

585
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,960
but for what it's worth, this is my real hair,

586
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,820
at least on this half, and these are my real boobs,

587
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:06,260
and if I bring home a gentleman or a lady,

588
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,760
all that stays on in bed,

589
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,420
and it's there when I wake up in the morning,

590
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,320
but what about the penis?

591
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,140
All right!

592
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,640
Look, if the penis is feminine, how is that gay?

593
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,520
I rest my case.

594
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,660
Roll credits.

595
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,800
You can't make me lose.

596
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,300
Six, the feminine penis.

597
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,380
Look, some guys want the Ts and the D,

598
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,480
and that's the T.

599
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,060
Now, a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick,

600
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:34,620
even a lady dick, makes any sexual interaction

601
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,400
with a man gay, but isn't male homosexuality

602
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:41,000
usually understood as attraction to men,

603
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,120
and not merely to,

604
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:45,120
penises, wherever they may arise?

605
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,820
I think there probably are some gay men

606
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:50,160
who really just like dick, and I'm not judging.

607
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,300
I'm not here to attack anyone's preferences,

608
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,760
but being a straight man,

609
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,780
I don't really think that's best understood

610
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,100
as a man attracted to vaginas.

611
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,960
You call women pussy, but then you're always like,

612
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,400
ew, period.

613
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,500
I'm a straight man.

614
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,800
I'm not used to putting a towel down when I fuck.

615
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,020
I don't know how to use a condom

616
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:08,200
because I expect cis women to be on birth control

617
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,440
and do everything for me,

618
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,120
and then you have straight incels online calling libies,

619
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
and then you have straight incels online calling libies,

620
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
and then you have straight incels online calling libies,

621
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,260
and then you have straight incels online calling libies,

622
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,660
and generally putting on a show of vaginal disgust.

623
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,180
I mean, if you're gonna date cis women

624
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,580
or post-op trans women,

625
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,700
I think you owe it to them

626
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,740
to be a little more vagina positive.

627
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,020
Because even though straight men are like,

628
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,740
ew, dicks, that's gay,

629
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,920
you guys also kind of love dicks.

630
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,180
You're always drawing them.

631
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,860
Your buildings look like dicks.

632
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,500
Your porn all has dicks in it.

633
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,120
So what about dicks on chicks?

634
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,360
Well, men like chicks and men like dicks,

635
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,300
so what's the problem, officer?

636
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,640
I think the booming popularity of T-girl porn

637
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,520
speaks for itself.

638
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,560
On PornHub,

639
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,380
The shemale category contains more videos

640
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:46,100
than other such popular categories

641
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,840
as rough sex, orgy, and webcam,

642
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:50,900
and it's mostly straight men who watch it.

643
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,680
When adultempire.com moved their T-Girl content

644
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,500
from their gay site to their straight site,

645
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,120
views increased 50%.

646
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,840
In 2016, the same year North Carolina passed

647
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,560
a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom bill,

648
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,940
the adult site Game Link's top-selling titles

649
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:08,160
in North Carolina were My Transsexual Teacher,

650
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:12,780
Shemale Shenanigans, and Joey Silvera's Transvisions 6.

651
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,760
A lot of straight men first find out

652
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,360
about trans women through porn,

653
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,880
which isn't great since most T-Girl porn

654
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,200
is not transpositive and uses dehumanizing slurs

655
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,840
like shemale and tranny,

656
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,480
which is how you end up living in a country

657
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
full of people who will jerk off to you

658
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,960
but won't give you rights.

659
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,120
So to a lot of men, that's the representation we have.

660
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,480
Shemales, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner.

661
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,280
Great, I love that for us.

662
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,800
Now there probably are some men

663
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,480
who will always be put off by a woman's having a dick,

664
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,560
and you know what?

665
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,620
That's fine.

666
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:46,660
Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage.

667
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:47,840
You like what you like.

668
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,920
I'm not here to police anyone's desires.

669
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,040
In fact, quite the opposite.

670
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:54,120
I'm here to liberate men of sophisticated taste

671
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,360
from society's cruel and unjust prejudice

672
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,060
against their T-Girl-loving ways.

673
00:25:58,060 --> 00:26:00,400
But liberation begins with understanding.

674
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,880
So who are the men who love trans girls?

675
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,820
Well, according to trans women I've talked to

676
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,640
in my own personal experience,

677
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,760
the men who date us can be

678
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,980
divided into three general groups.

679
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,720
Group one are men who, to be honest,

680
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,000
are actually kind of put off by the dick,

681
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,760
but they're so attracted to the woman it's attached to

682
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,040
that they're willing to work around it

683
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,020
or wait for it to grow on them.

684
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,640
Group two are men who are attracted to trans women

685
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,220
including their penises,

686
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,900
but they don't specifically fetishize the penis,

687
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,880
so they wouldn't mind if their trans lover

688
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:34,000
had genital reassignment and got a vagina.

689
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,280
And then group three are men

690
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,480
who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks,

691
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:41,220
and often want to worship the penis or be penetrated by it.

692
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,340
Now group three are what the trans community calls chasers.

693
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,480
Dating chasers is generally a bad idea

694
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
because their attraction to us

695
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,200
is based around fetishizing our genitals,

696
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,440
which is often the part of us

697
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,200
that we're most uncomfortable with.

698
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,760
So if you're a T-Girl who likes men,

699
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,140
group two is really Goldilocks perfection

700
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,220
unless you really like topping or you've had the surgery.

701
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,240
Now I should say that group two

702
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,020
does include some bisexual men,

703
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,720
and bisexual people of either gender

704
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,680
can be great partners if you're trans.

705
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,460
You like girls, you like dick.

706
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,680
I'm a girl with a dick.

707
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,800
Let's make this happen.

708
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,240
That said, if someone views that part of me as male

709
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,640
and wants me to do with it what men do with it,

710
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,240
then pass, not interested.

711
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,560
Now, you might be wondering,

712
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:22,380
what is this post-modern neo-Marxist SJW insanity?

713
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,660
How could I view it as anything other than a male part?

714
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,940
It's a fucking penis!

715
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,460
Well, I'm glad you asked.

716
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,560
I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone

717
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,960
about the ecstasies of the feminine penis.

718
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,880
You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine.

719
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,500
Usage and physiology.

720
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,060
So first, context.

721
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,860
Picture in your mind's eye a feminine woman.

722
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,960
Now, picture her with a penis.

723
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,760
That's not a man's penis, that's a woman's penis.

724
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,760
It's feminine because of the context that it's in.

725
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,280
Second, usage.

726
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,460
A lesson in penis etiquette.

727
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,860
A gentleman need not be coy about his penis.

728
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:00,420
He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug,

729
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:02,860
he may penetrate, he may order you to get on your knees

730
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:04,280
like a good girl and .

731
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,240
As it is a truth universally acknowledged

732
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,760
that a lady of good breeding never brandishes her penis.

733
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,360
When she rises from the bath,

734
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,400
she covers it gracefully with a demure hand,

735
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,140
and when not in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away.

736
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,240
Here's how to tuck your penis like a lady.

737
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,800
The first step is to put on a set of vicious stiletto claws.

738
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,860
This doesn't make things any easier,

739
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,820
but it does build character.

740
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,660
Next, you want to take not one, but two, two, three, four,

741
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:40,100
but two pairs of cotton-lined, polyspandex,

742
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,700
bikini-cut panties, at least one size too small,

743
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,980
and pull them most of the way up your legs.

744
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:49,840
Now, there's just no way to put this delicately, my dears.

745
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,340
You're gonna take your claw,

746
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,220
and you're gonna grab your scrotum,

747
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,040
and you're gonna yank that bubble gum

748
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,380
back into your peach crease.

749
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,060
Now hold it back with one hand,

750
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,780
and with your other hand, push your penis back,

751
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:03,820
pressing those little legs up into your pelvis.

752
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:06,220
Bring your thighs together to hold everything in place,

753
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,900
and then pull your panties up.

754
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,060
Front first, then back, run your hand over it

755
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,400
to make sure nothing's seeping out the sides,

756
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,820
and then voila, it's like it was never there.

757
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,980
For more information, you can purchase my book,

758
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,100
Tuck Your Penis, with a new foreword

759
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:22,940
by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.

760
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,720
I've now explained both the context

761
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,920
and the usage of the feminine penis,

762
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:28,980
so let us now turn to physiology.

763
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,640
Most people don't realize that taking feminizing hormones

764
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,240
actually changes the anatomy and functionality

765
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,100
of the genitals, shrinking everything

766
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,200
down and softening everything up.

767
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,540
That means changes to a little thing

768
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,480
not a lot of people are talking about,

769
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,920
but something I've been trying to raise awareness of,

770
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,920
you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue,

771
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,920
really get people talking about seven, the mouth feel.

772
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:03,180
Oh hi, it's me, Natalie Nguyen, your tasting specialist.

773
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,280
I have tasted everything.

774
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,840
Both the trans and the oral penis.

775
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,220
And I've been able to discover that this is almost

776
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,820
the same thing as the royal flush of oral sex.

777
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:18,200
Girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy,

778
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,660
and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris.

779
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:25,560
But today, we amuse the palate with the feminine penis.

780
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,160
Now, with respect to flavor, the feminine penis

781
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,880
has more sweetness than the masculine penis

782
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,880
and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick, umami.

783
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:42,220
To mouthfeel, the feminine penis is of course softer and smoother than the masculine penis

784
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,400
and does not become as turgid.

785
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:51,860
And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes

786
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:57,880
of saline, whereas boy cum is milky, viscous, and more acidic.

787
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:06,020
It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers that sucking a female penis is not gay.

788
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
Cheers!

789
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,120
8. Being straight is pretty gay

790
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,880
So I've been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women, but ultimately,

791
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:26,980
you kinda just need to try it yourself to fully, viscerally understand why sex with

792
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,380
a trans woman is sex with a woman.

793
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:33,900
Now, we must always be wary of being overly simplistic in our thinking.

794
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,900
Sexuality is complicated.

795
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,900
And while it's undeniable,

796
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:42,080
that many straight men are attracted to trans women, the messy reality is that a lot of

797
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,340
straight men are also attracted to male cross-dressers.

798
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,320
Before I transitioned, I was a cross-dresser, and I didn't present super womanly either,

799
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,680
like fully Dr. Frankenfurter.

800
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,300
And that's why I'm so iconic.

801
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:58,340
I showed the world that in two years, you can transition from literally Dr. Frankenfurter

802
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:02,020
to a very real, very biological drag queen.

803
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:05,000
But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite, I still got sex with a woman.

804
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,680
I still got semi-regular messages from men being like,

805
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:14,100
So, I'm a straight man, but I'm like, really attracted to you when you dress as a woman

806
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:17,120
and it's really making me question my sexuality.

807
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,620
Now, I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like, well maybe those men

808
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:26,480
just picked up on my inherently womanly, female energy essence that I've always had since

809
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,500
I was born a female, biological soul trapped in the body of a cross-dressing baby.

810
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
But let's be real.

811
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,000
There are straight men who fuck cross-dressers.

812
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
There are straight men who fuck cross-dressers.

813
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
There are straight men who fuck drag queens.

814
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:41,760
There are straight-identifying men who fuck other straight-identifying men.

815
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,040
What is going on here?

816
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Straight men, what is your deal?

817
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Who are you?

818
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
What is your life?

819
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,040
How did you become straight?

820
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,180
Did they recruit you?

821
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,540
Were you groomed?

822
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,540
I blame the parents.

823
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,380
Let's go back to the game you guys like to play, the one I call, Is This Gay?

824
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:59,380
The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that they're sex acts between people

825
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,380
of the same gender.

826
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,760
But I've heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that's gay.

827
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,660
Or that it's gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples.

828
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:13,540
To be clear, we're talking about one man and one woman, Eve sucking Adam's nipples, and

829
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,020
according to these men, it's totally gay.

830
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:21,120
What that shows is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a

831
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,180
man and a woman.

832
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:26,560
It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who

833
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,400
are playing the correct roles.

834
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,640
So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according

835
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,760
to this very fragile view of heterosexuality,

836
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,060
he ceases to be straight.

837
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,400
Even a man's own relationship with his body is policed by these narrow confines.

838
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:46,580
For instance, some men won't even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary

839
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,560
twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos.

840
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:54,920
I mean to be fair, before I washed my asshole, I was a quarterback.

841
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
Now I'm a cheerleader.

842
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,800
B-I-C-T-R-O, why don't tell the coach I was a guy?

843
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,440
This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me

844
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:09,320
of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation.

845
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:13,260
Basically it's a style of moral thinking that treats the body like a temple that must

846
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:17,900
be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can fuck

847
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,680
and what you can eat, so for example religious dietary laws.

848
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:27,660
I think this hyper-masculine hetero-man code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of

849
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:32,500
kosher law governing straightness, and the is this gay game is its theology.

850
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,600
Now this whole line of thinking has been reducing over the years.

851
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,300
I'm not sure if it's true or not.

852
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,180
It was introduced to absurdity pretty effectively by, of all people, Count Dankula.

853
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:44,860
If you class yourself as a straight man, and you're masturbating, that means that you're

854
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,420
touching a dick, and that's gay.

855
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,340
Well memed my lord, well memed.

856
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:55,620
The pinnacle of the whole conversation is reached when Dankula concludes that since a woman inherits

857
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:01,260
half her DNA from her father, she's technically half a man, and therefore having sex with a

858
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,840
woman is pretty gay.

859
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:08,940
Obviously this is shit-posting, but it's logically just as good an argument as traps

860
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,840
are gay because chromosomes.

861
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:15,140
So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay.

862
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:17,360
So what is being gay?

863
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Socrates.

864
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
Hmm.

865
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:22,400
On second thought, I don't know her.

866
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,400
9.

867
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,800
Being gay is good actually.

868
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,060
Sometimes when you've been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it's

869
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,540
good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the

870
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,540
first place?

871
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,820
Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight?

872
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,660
It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with

873
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:45,420
manhood, and they defend their manhood at all costs.

874
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:49,780
Now men, this might be difficult to hear, and maybe you don't want to hear it from me,

875
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,800
but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it's hurting cis women, and it's hurting trans

876
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,860
women, and it's hurting gay people.

877
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,720
For one thing, it makes you really really bad at sex.

878
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,180
Who wants to sleep with a guy who is so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can't even

879
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,180
have sex?

880
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,480
He can't even enjoy his own body.

881
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,380
Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay.

882
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,680
Being pegged does not make you gay.

883
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:15,260
Sucking another man's dick, just to try it, does not make you gay.

884
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:16,260
And why?

885
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:21,540
Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is

886
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,740
persistently attracted to people of the same gender.

887
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,480
If you're persistently attracted to people of the same gender, and you identify with

888
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,840
the word gay, then you're gay.

889
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:31,660
If not, then you're not.

890
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,660
And nothing you can do will change that.

891
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,160
9.

892
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,540
Being Gay

893
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:38,780
So that's one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is

894
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,780
good actually.

895
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,220
I mean, why would you be worried about this if you didn't think being gay was bad?

896
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:48,060
Now, I don't identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense.

897
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,060
We the gays.

898
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:55,240
But as a queer person, I can't help but be a little bit wounded by the fact that straight

899
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,200
men are so obsessed with proving that they aren't like us.

900
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,160
But that is not a wound I am going to dwell on.

901
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,480
Because life is much too short for that.

902
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,880
I don't want to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage.

903
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,880
Are traps gay?

904
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Baby, who cares?

905
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Just do it feels good.

906
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,940
That's the simple answer, but the truth is that when people say, traps are gay but there's

907
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:21,600
nothing wrong with being gay, that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men

908
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,240
and to reinforce the stigma against dating us among the group of people who are in fact

909
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,900
most attracted to us.

910
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:32,720
Because it is mostly straight men and not gay men who like us.

911
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:37,380
And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted

912
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,980
to us are willing to openly date us.

913
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,020
And the stigma is very real.

914
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:47,080
A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness.

915
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,960
Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they

916
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:57,200
experience, in short, a sample of the difficulty all queer people face.

917
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,120
But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices

918
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,000
control his life.

919
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,900
A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.

920
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:16,000
A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves.

921
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:23,800
And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I'm still more of a

922
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,060
man than you.

923
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,100
10.

924
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,000
I have feelings too.

925
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,640
Well, I guess today we learned that Are Traps Gay? is not a debate worth winning, because

926
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,740
just by participating, we're accepting the validity of an insincere question and the

927
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,160
bigoted assumptions it relies on.

928
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:55,500
Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is

929
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,500
deserved.

930
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,840
Hashtag not all gamers.

931
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,120
But also, this video completely centers men's feelings.

932
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,120
And if you want to know more, click here.

933
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,320
And I have feelings too, goddammit.

934
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,340
And some of those feelings are not all that different from the anxieties men have.

935
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:12,060
Let me explain.

936
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
Let me explain.

937
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:18,000
So I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology

938
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,920
for confused slutbag.

939
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:24,880
Before I transitioned, I dated women, and I still do have lesbicious and lesbinaical

940
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,880
feelings.

941
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:30,380
But early in my transition, I encountered a lot of TERF shit, and it really scared me

942
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:31,100
off dating cis lesbians.

943
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,100
Which I never did.

944
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Which I never have.

945
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,740
Even before I transitioned, the question, do I want to fuck men, had been in the back

946
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,680
of my head for a long time.

947
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,160
But about a year ago, I was like, I want to fuck men.

948
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:44,240
I want to fuck men.

949
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,280
But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified.

950
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
Because men are scary.

951
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:53,360
And in my early transition, I'd only dated bisexual trans people and enbies.

952
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:56,780
And as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory.

953
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:00,040
A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed.

954
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,280
That teaches you something about gender.

955
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,920
It might be hard to believe.

956
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,120
It might be hard to learn otherwise.

957
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:09,620
And loving a trans woman, like, I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I'm a real

958
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:10,620
woman.

959
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:15,380
But to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as like the radiant model

960
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,340
of womanhood, that's an experience that's meant a lot to me.

961
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,680
And if you're attracted to women, and that's an experience you haven't had, you're missing

962
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,680
out.

963
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:28,160
But what I was going to say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a pretty safe group

964
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,680
of people to date when you're early in transition.

965
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,120
Because they're pretty chill about anatomy.

966
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,120
And presentation.

967
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:36,960
But if you're going to date cishet men, you need to be serving women.

968
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,800
And I guess you don't need to, but it doesn't hurt.

969
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,000
And I did wonder if I was woman enough for it.

970
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
So the first couple of times I was so afraid, I was like, when I take my clothes off, is

971
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,280
he going to think I'm a man?

972
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,720
Basically my anxiety was, are traps gay?

973
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,360
But what I ended up doing is just working up to things gradually.

974
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,620
And of course, you start by sucking dick.

975
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,620
That's very safe, because like, what red blooded man is going to turn down a t-girl blowjob?

976
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:01,560
And it doesn't involve my dick.

977
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,080
It's not my dick.

978
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
It's not my junk in any way.

979
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,840
But then I got a little bolder, and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned,

980
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,460
we'd been guy friends.

981
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:14,120
So to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between a man and a woman,

982
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,300
like, that shit is super hot.

983
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:20,360
Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk, and I let a straight guy go down on

984
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,960
me, and I was so nervous about that, because like, what if he thinks I'm a man?

985
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,360
What if he's repulsed?

986
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,500
Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked?

987
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,360
The answer is yes.

988
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,680
It was so hot.

989
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
I loved it.

990
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,680
He loved it.

991
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:41,120
And just knowing that he'd never done that before, but I would just say it's special.

992
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,120
Ten out of ten.

993
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,740
And you know what he told me after?

994
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:48,800
He told me he liked the mouth feel.

995
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
Everyone's talking about it now, bitches.

996
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:56,560
So look, I really don't want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women,

997
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,360
because I mean, I was anxious too, in the other direction.

998
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
But I do want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women, because I mean,

999
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,360
I was anxious too, in the other direction.

1000
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,440
I do want to shame men for treating trans women like they're dirty little secrets.

1001
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,780
And I do want to shame men for dehumanizing us and voting away our rights by day, while

1002
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,980
jerking off to shemale porn by night.

1003
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:15,020
And I do want to shame men for refusing to date us because they're not fucking strong

1004
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:20,320
enough to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every

1005
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,680
moment of every day.

1006
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,140
And I do want to shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends because they couldn't

1007
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,600
stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes.

1008
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
That is pathetic.

1009
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:35,480
If you're so worried about proving you're a man, why don't you start by standing up

1010
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,780
for the women you love, you chicken shit cowards.

1011
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,920
So look, what I'm asking for is so basic.

1012
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,760
Don't call human beings traps.

1013
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,720
If you're attracted to trans women, don't be ashamed of it.

1014
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,640
It's okay, you can date us.

1015
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,600
We're more than just jack off material.

1016
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:53,920
If you aren't attracted to trans women, respect the people who are.

1017
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,880
If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess, because god knows she's been

1018
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,880
through enough shit.

1019
00:42:58,880 --> 00:42:59,880
And finally, protect her.

1020
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,660
Protect trans women of color at all costs.

1021
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:06,320
All I want here is basic human decency.

1022
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:08,980
Is that really too much to ask?

1023
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,860
Well, this is the internet, so yes, yes it is.

1024
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,940
God damn it.

1025
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:21,980
Well, that was long.

1026
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:29,720
I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud said,

1027
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:35,520
sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful woman's penis.

1028
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:53,720
You must think that you are so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully,

1029
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,720
unaware of how crude, hurt before, bigoted, and plain rude.

1030
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:57,720
But you're not.

1031
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:58,720
You're not.

1032
00:43:58,720 --> 00:43:59,720
You're not.

1033
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:13,520
Oh my god, think about all the things that you have said to us.

1034
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:17,200
All the things that you say come up everyday.

1035
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:24,520
There is one thing that I cannot stand.

1036
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,720
And it's you dear, head in the sand.

1037
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:26,680
It's not really ignorance of mine.

1038
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,680
It's the willful bigot's avocado.

1039
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Oh.

1040
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:35,960
There is one thing that I cannot stand

1041
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:38,720
And it's you, dear, head in the sand

1042
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:43,340
There's no release from ignorance in my mind

1043
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:46,520
Just the willful bigots who find us

1044
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:50,240
Don't let them define us
