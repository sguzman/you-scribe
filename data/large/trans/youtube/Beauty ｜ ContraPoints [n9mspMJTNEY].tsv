0	5000	My face is the front of shop
7000	9000	My face is the real shop front
11000	13000	My shop is the fake side front
15000	17000	I'm real when I shop my face
30000	50000	Hey guys, it's Natalie. Welcome back to my channel. Today I'm going to do a makeup tutorial as always. But first, story time, story time, story time. I just want to be up front with you guys and let you know that I've had some facial surgery.
50000	59000	I'm always going to be honest with you guys about this kind of thing because you mean so much to me. Like, you've been here with me since the beginning and you've seen my story. My whole entire journey.
59000	60000	This journey I've been on.
60000	61000	As a transgender woman.
61000	63000	You've been with me on this whole journey.
63000	65000	This is my truth and you've accepted the truth of my journey.
65000	70000	This is a really vulnerable moment for me and you guys are just as special because you've been here for me throughout my whole transgender journey.
70000	72000	The whole message of my journey as an influencer.
72000	76000	It's just been so impactful on my life and the truth of my living.
76000	78000	It's just so meaningful that you guys have made it this far.
78000	84000	It really means so much to me that you guys are supporting the truth of the life experience of my transgender journey as an YouTube influencer.
84000	87000	And it's been so painful and during a really vulnerable time for me.
87000	90000	And I'm just so grateful to you guys because you're so meaningful and you've encouraged me.
90000	96000	I think the main thing we've learned together on this channel is that makeup is a lot of fun but it's inner beauty that really counts.
96000	98000	Anyway, let's talk about plastic surgery.
98000	102000	I had facial feminization surgery on April 2nd, so about a month and a half ago.
102000	110000	What we call facial feminization surgery or FFS is actually a series of different procedures that some transgender women choose to have to look more feminine.
110000	117000	So what I had done is forehead contouring, a brow lift, rhinoplasty, mandible contouring, a trachea shave.
117000	119000	You know what, let's just have the skull lady talk you through it.
119000	129000	A coronal incision was made towards the cranial vault, whence the skin of the forehead was stripped away from the bone.
129000	137000	A fragment of the supra-orbital ridge was then chiselled away, removed, reshaped and re-affixed,
137000	147000	thereby eliminating that undesirable prominence of a robust brow that oftentimes distinguishes the skull of the child.
147000	149000	A second incision was made
149000	151620	the columella of the nasal septum,
151620	153900	facilitating the reconstruction
153900	157100	of the anterior cartilage and bone.
157100	161740	Further incisions were made betwixt the gum and cheek,
161740	165160	through which the mandible was rasped and shaved
165160	169840	down to a gracile curvature of a jaw and pointed chin,
169840	172640	thereby delineating a facial silhouette
172640	176880	exhibiting that aspect which medical men call cunty.
176880	178020	It all sounds pretty gruesome
178020	179320	when you describe it like that,
179320	180960	but there's actually a very fine level
180960	182960	of technique and aesthetics involved.
182960	185280	My plastic surgeon is an artist.
185280	186480	The results are natural,
186480	188300	I don't look like I've had a bunch of work done,
188300	189260	which is good, you know,
189260	190900	you at least wanna leave people wondering,
190900	192100	maybe she's born with it,
192100	193740	maybe a surgeon peeled her face off
193740	194960	and fixed her shitty skull.
194960	196240	Here's a before and after picture
196240	197720	where you can clearly see the difference.
197720	199460	To use the exact medical terminology,
199460	202260	my brows on fleek, my nose is no longer busted the house,
202260	204920	my jaw snatched, and my Adam's apple is canceled.
204920	206780	Wasn't it always really Eve's apple?
206780	207900	Maybe Satan's apple?
207900	209280	I think I still look like myself.
209280	210760	It's not a new face.
210760	212900	We're talking about millimeters of bone here.
212900	214520	But to have all that done was,
214520	216440	well, it costs a lot of money.
216440	219920	The anticipation was, oh, terror like I've never known.
219920	222120	The pain was memorable.
222120	224020	And the recovery took more than a month.
224020	226200	In fact, I still have some swelling in my jowls.
226200	229140	Jowls, there's a nice feminine sounding word, love that.
229140	231260	The standard YouTube T-girl thing to do, of course,
231260	232940	would have been to vlog the whole journey.
232940	235420	Story time, my facial surgery experience,
235420	237740	my FFS journey, and post-constant social media,
237740	239500	and all the media updates about it.
239500	241980	And I am grateful to the trans women who have done that
241980	243740	because it was really helpful to me
243740	245920	to be able to watch those vlogs in advance
245920	247800	and know what I was getting myself into.
247800	249920	But I decided not to post about the surgery
249920	252020	because I wanted privacy for the recovery
252020	254360	and to just take some time to get to feel at home
254360	256560	with the results before subjecting myself
256560	259200	to the vicious things they say about me in the tabloids.
259200	261620	You know, I think I've been kind of psychologically damaged
261620	263580	by reading for years the things people say
263580	265160	about my appearance online.
265160	267040	And I'm not even talking about the haters.
267040	268620	I mean, I can mostly brush them off.
268620	270000	But for instance, about a year ago,
270000	271920	I was reading through a transgender subreddit
271920	274620	and some trans woman was agonizing about her appearance
274620	276300	and someone offered the encouragement,
276300	279620	you know, you can still look hot even if you don't pass.
279620	281220	Just look at ContraPoints.
281220	284120	Ugh, like a dagger to the heart.
284120	285960	The unintentional shade of it all.
287640	289840	So the past six weeks have been, at times,
289840	292220	difficult and lonely, but I did manage to keep
292220	294660	my mug off social media for long enough
294660	296520	that I'm as ready as I'm ever gonna be
296520	298400	for the commentary of the internet.
298400	302800	So bring it on, you jackals, you vultures, you goblin swine.
302800	304920	While I was lying around bandaged and bored,
304920	306540	I did have a lot of time to think.
306540	307960	And what I've been thinking about
307960	310700	is probably the same thing you're wondering right now,
310700	314500	which is why would someone do what I just did?
314500	316600	Why would I spend so much time and money
316600	318900	and go through so much anxiety and pain
318900	321600	just to change a few millimeters of bone?
321600	323660	Isn't this all just extravagant vanity,
323660	326440	some narcissistic symptom of phones but too much?
326520	328300	Well, I feel like there's a lot of pressure on me
328300	331380	to say that, in fact, this wasn't cosmetic surgery at all.
331380	332980	Usually, trans people say that surgeries
332980	335100	like facial feminization, top surgery,
335100	336960	general reassignment, and so on,
336960	340140	serve the sole purpose of alleviating gender dysphoria,
340140	342560	this discomfort we feel with the mismatch
342560	344640	between our bodies and our gender identity.
344640	346600	So what I'm supposed to say is that my surgery
346600	349640	was a medically necessary, reconstructive procedure
349640	352880	needed to make my testosterone-weathered facial bones
352880	355380	match the five-foot-two, happy baby bouncy bio girl
355380	356520	I truly am inside.
356520	358640	Thereby, alleviating my dysphoria,
358640	360680	helping me safely blend into society,
360680	363240	and preventing a five-alarm psychiatric meltdown.
363240	365080	And there is definitely truth to that.
365080	366920	It's certainly the argument I intend to make
366920	369640	when I write this off as a medical expense on my taxes.
369640	372440	If you're an IRS auditor, please stop this video now
372440	375640	and insert the next floppy disk into your CD drive.
375640	377080	But hypothetically speaking,
377080	379960	I think the reality might not be quite so simple.
379960	382520	How sharp is the line separating gender dysphoria
382520	384600	from the other kinds of body image dysphoria
384600	386040	that drive cisgender people
386040	388120	to get cosmetic surgery all the time?
388120	391080	Last year, when I used to foolishly tweet things of substance,
391080	393240	I tweeted that I wanted to get FFS,
393240	395080	and some trans people responded,
395080	396280	telling me that I was suffering
396280	398760	from internalized transphobia and self-loathing.
398760	400520	They compared it to East Asian people
400520	402120	getting double eyelid surgery,
402120	403960	or so-called ethnic rhinoplasty,
403960	406440	which they say are motivated by internalized racism
406440	407960	and Western beauty standards.
407960	409800	I think that's a pretty weak analogy,
409800	411000	and telling a trans person
411000	412920	to just learn to accept the way they look
412920	415160	can actually be kind of transphobic,
415160	415960	because a big part
415960	417640	of what it even means to be trans,
417640	418680	at least for me,
418680	420520	is the desire to look more female.
420520	422920	But I also think trans people often talk
422920	424360	like gender dysphoria
424360	426600	is this intrinsic, personal experience
426600	428520	that's always 100% valid
428520	430360	and never has anything at all to do
430360	432600	with the external pressure of beauty standards.
432600	433560	But in fact,
433560	436040	gender dysphoria is not sealed away in a vacuum
436040	438760	away from the influence of societal ideals and norms.
438760	439880	Early in my transition,
439880	442520	some of my worst dysphoria was about body hair,
442520	444600	so I had full body laser hair removal,
444600	445640	and now I'm smoother
445640	447320	than a cisgender boiled egg.
447320	448200	But where does the idea
448200	450280	that women don't have body hair come from?
450280	452520	Isn't that just an arbitrary grooming custom?
452520	453800	A lot of the cis women I know
453800	455640	don't so much as shave their legs,
455640	458760	so maybe I'm not even trying to look like a cis woman.
458760	461160	Maybe I'm simply doing everything I can
461160	463800	to avoid looking like the caricature
463800	465240	of a knuckly, hairy,
466600	467880	mannish trans woman
467880	470920	with which society has terrorized me to my core.
470920	472760	Is this gender dysphoria?
472760	475080	Or is it internalized transphobia?
475080	477560	Or is it simply a cosmetic preference?
477560	479480	When I try to psychoanalyze myself,
479480	481880	I find that my desires to look female,
481880	482920	to look feminine,
482920	484280	and to look beautiful
484280	485800	are not exactly the same,
485800	488200	but they're woven together so tightly
488200	490520	that it's kind of difficult to untangle them.
490520	492440	And the opposite is also true,
492440	493160	that for me,
493160	495240	feeling mannish or dysphoric
495240	497480	usually goes along with feeling ugly.
497480	498680	I don't have a lot of days
498680	500280	where I walk out the house thinking,
500280	501960	well, I'm giving femme queen realness,
501960	502760	but apart from that,
502760	504120	I look like absolute shit.
504120	504440	Of course,
504440	506440	there are qualities that make you look female
506440	508360	that aren't necessarily attractive,
508360	510360	like cellulite or flabby arms,
510360	511720	which are super fish,
511720	513720	but aren't deemed beautiful by society.
513720	514440	The truth is,
514440	516440	I don't just want to look female,
516440	517960	I want to be beautiful.
518520	519480	Desperately.
519480	520440	God, I'll do anything.
521160	521720	Anything.
522360	523000	In this video,
523000	524920	I want to explore why I'm so obsessed
524920	526120	with being beautiful,
526120	527640	and why it seems like a lot of people
527640	530120	who live in a society are so obsessed.
530120	531080	Is it phones?
531640	533000	It's probably phones.
533000	534120	I know you're supposed to pretend
534120	535560	that you don't care about being beautiful
535560	536600	or that you're not trying,
536600	537640	but guys,
537640	538600	it's the only thing I care about
538600	539960	and I've never tried so hard at anything.
539960	540280	Of course,
540280	542840	I do feel guilty about being so obsessed with it,
542840	543880	because there's this idea
543880	546840	that caring about beauty makes you shallow or vain.
546840	547240	You know,
547240	549960	smart people aren't supposed to care about beauty,
549960	552360	and I've always been categorized as a smart person
552360	553480	by people around me.
553480	555400	Some of that is when you're raised like I was,
555400	558120	as a middle-class white boy with no athletic talent.
558120	561320	Parents and teachers treat you like a fucking genius,
561320	563960	like Einstein nutted a load in Mozart's bussy,
563960	565320	and Mozart shat you out
565320	566840	while he was getting a rusty trombone
566840	568200	from Vincent van Gogh.
568200	569800	It inspired his famous painting,
569800	570680	Starfish Night.
570680	571800	But even among women,
571800	573960	caring about beauty is often frowned upon.
573960	575640	I feel like an alien species
575640	577640	when I hang out with women in academia,
577640	578440	and I know a few
578440	579960	because I once got half a PhD
579960	581400	before dropping out to become a,
582280	583640	what do you call someone who makes videos?
584200	584920	A cam girl.
584920	587080	Most female grad students and professors I know
587080	588040	don't wear makeup.
588040	588280	To them,
588280	590680	the idea of earnestly putting on press-on nails
590680	592920	or false eyelashes is inconceivable.
592920	593080	Like,
593080	593880	maybe on Halloween,
593880	597080	and part of that is that women in male-dominated fields
597080	599240	sometimes feel like they have to present more masculine
599240	600680	to be taken seriously,
600680	601800	because of this prejudice
601800	604520	that beautified femininity equals frivolous.
604520	606200	But another part is clearly some kind of
606200	608040	not-like-other-girls weird flex.
608040	608520	Which,
608520	609240	okay,
609240	609800	fine,
609800	610440	whatever,
610440	611800	I'm not gonna judge another woman
611800	613560	for the way she copes with a society
613560	615240	that pressures women to be beautiful
615240	618120	while simultaneously belittling them for caring about it.
618120	620280	I guess my way of coping is this tacky,
620280	621160	heteronormative,
621160	623240	and tragically sincere aspiration
623240	625960	to some kind of post-ironic feminine beauty.
625960	627080	Why am I like this?
627080	629480	Well, part of it is vindictive transsexualism,
629480	630360	pure and simple.
630360	632040	To all the people who've ever called me a man,
632040	632600	I wanna say,
633240	633960	fuck you.
633960	637320	By looking like the undeniable visual archetype of a woman,
637320	639320	which is a beautiful, feminine woman.
640360	643480	Who's wearing 600,000 sequins.
643480	644840	They're biological sequins.
646120	646620	Uh.
648200	648760	Ooh.
648760	650440	That is some ASMR right there,
650440	650940	listen to that.
652280	652780	Oh.
653240	653740	Oh.
662520	664920	Another factor is this shitty website.
664920	667400	I'm a professional YouTube influencer,
667400	668600	forgive me father,
668600	670120	and I'm on camera all the time.
670120	671240	I edit my own videos,
671240	673720	so I spend upwards of 60 hours a month
673720	675720	staring at my own face on a screen.
675720	676760	Now you try doing that
676760	679080	and see what kind of fucked up complex you develop.
679080	682280	Plus, I compare myself to other women who make videos.
682280	684520	A lot of the trans women on YouTube are so young,
684520	685400	and so beautiful,
685400	686920	it makes me wanna throw up.
686920	687800	And in comparison,
687800	688680	for a long time,
688680	691160	I've felt like this shabby,
691160	692680	aging transvestite.
692680	696600	Just this feral cat wandering the aisles of the liquor store.
696600	697640	So I'm insecure,
697640	699560	I'm compensating for that whole mess,
699560	702200	but I honestly don't resent the beautiful people,
702200	704520	I really just stand the hell out of them.
704520	705880	I follow this woman on YouTube,
705880	707480	but I wanna be just like her mom.
707480	709960	Her name is Dame Jefferson Starr.
709960	711560	Her name is Lady Jane McLean.
711560	714120	Senora Nicole Beatrice Tutorials.
714120	716440	Tatyana Petrovna West-Rykova.
716440	718120	And of course my queen and perfect goddess,
718120	718840	whomst I stan,
718840	720840	and whose portrait I've painted hundreds of times.
720840	722920	So there's maybe some extra intensity for me,
722920	724600	but I think it's actually pretty normal
724600	725720	to wanna be beautiful.
725720	727640	I think even grad students wanna be beautiful.
727640	729720	They just wanna do it in that Becky kind of way,
729720	732120	where you scoff at anything glam or artificial.
732120	734520	And it's not just women who care about beauty either.
734520	737240	I mean, gay men in LA have always been getting cosmetic surgery,
737240	739080	but now even the straights are doing it.
739080	741560	Incels are completely obsessed with the details,
741560	743400	the defects of their personal appearance.
743400	745160	And the ones who aren't completely black-pilled
745160	746920	are obsessed with plastic surgery.
746920	750200	The incel newspeak word for beauty is looks-maxing,
750200	751640	because of course they have to go about this
751640	753480	in the most heterosexual possible way.
753480	755800	It is imperative to implement a skin-max regimen
755800	757640	in order to maximize looks-money status
757640	759320	and secure access to females.
759320	760440	Oh my god, calm down.
760440	761960	Not every sentence out of your mouth
761960	764600	has to be worded like a dispatch to the police commissioner.
764600	767880	Yes, they actually call skincare skin-maxing.
767880	769800	James Charles, I know you're having a hard month,
769800	771160	but I've got a business idea
771560	772920	to turn this thing around for you.
772920	773800	Here's the plan.
773800	775800	You're gonna create a new line of skincare products
775800	777960	called Chad Glow.
777960	780520	Bribe PewDiePie to send his fans to the promo video,
780520	781880	hi sister cells,
781880	783960	and send me a check in the mail, you're welcome.
783960	785480	If you read looks-max forums,
785480	788200	they're filled with discussions of brow ridge implants,
788200	790440	chin implants, mandible implants.
790440	794680	It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad
794680	798360	exhibiteth a jawbone most robust.
798360	801320	It's literally facial masculinization surgery.
801320	803480	So everyone's obsessed with the bones,
803480	805000	everyone's obsessed with beauty,
805000	809080	whether man or woman, cis or trans, gay or gamer.
809080	811400	Maybe lesbians are just straight chillin',
811400	813480	while everyone else has completely lost their minds.
813480	814360	But why?
814360	815960	Why do we care so much?
815960	817880	Well with incels, by their own account,
817880	820920	the only reason they care is they think that looks-maxing
820920	822840	will make femoids have sex with them,
822840	825640	and they think that will make their lives feel meaningful,
825640	828200	which it will not.
828200	829880	So incels are canceled.
829880	830760	Now what about women?
830760	831400	What's our deal?
831400	832200	What's our sitch?
832200	832840	What's our vibe?
832840	833720	What's our vij?
833720	836680	Well men seem to think that women are like inverted incels,
836680	838920	that we care about beauty and wear makeup,
838920	839560	fake up,
839560	841400	because we're trying to attract men.
841400	843480	My daddy Dom went on Vice News last year
843480	844920	and said that women wear makeup
844920	847560	because they're trying to stimulate male sexual arousal
847560	849000	and because evolution.
849000	850440	Now with the risk of being bratty,
850440	854360	I gotta say this is maybe 10% true and 90% false.
854360	856840	For one thing, straight men don't like makeup.
856840	858040	At least they don't think they do.
858040	860600	Here's a chart I made illustrating what every straight man
860600	862280	in the world thinks about makeup.
862280	863800	Yes, I asked all of them.
863800	866440	If you wear no makeup, they think you look diseased.
866440	867640	And I actually do look diseased
867640	869240	when I don't wear makeup so fair enough.
869240	870840	If you wear natural makeup, you know,
870840	873720	a little concealer, mascara, maybe a nude lip,
873720	876040	they think you're not wearing any makeup and they like it.
876040	878280	If you wear campy makeup, colorful eyeshadow,
878280	880200	heavy contouring, overdrawn lips,
880200	881800	they think it's dumb and they hate it.
881800	883480	Of course I'm generalizing.
883480	885320	Hashtag not all daddy doms.
885320	887800	But if women really wore makeup to attract men,
887800	889800	then you'd expect that they'd stop wearing it
889800	890520	when there are no men.
890520	892360	But that doesn't happen.
892360	894680	About a month ago, there was that video going around
894680	896920	of a woman showing how to make jailhouse makeup,
896920	899720	mixing deodorant and magazine ink to make eyeshadow,
899720	902200	using Kool-Aid and Vaseline to make lipstick.
902200	904360	There's not a lot of men in women's prison,
904360	906360	but women are still performing incredible feats
906360	909400	of ingenuity and resourcefulness just to wear makeup.
909400	911320	So maybe women are using makeup
911320	914120	to express their individuality and femininity,
914120	917320	you know, things that prison tries to take away from you.
917320	918360	Kinda makes sense.
918360	920200	There's a Refinery29 documentary
920200	923720	about prison cosmetology and also sexual exploitation, yikes,
923720	926120	in which a former inmate describes how women would engage
926120	929400	in sexual bartering with male guards just to get makeup.
929400	932680	If a girl's performing sexual favors for an officer,
932680	936040	he would bring her in colored pencils, lip gloss,
936040	937000	things like that.
937000	938600	That's right, women are sucking dicks
938600	941640	that they can put on makeup, not the other way around.
941640	944360	Honestly, if all the men died tomorrow, F,
944360	946200	I'd definitely keep wearing makeup.
946200	947320	In fact, I might wear more.
947320	948280	And I'm not just saying that
948280	950040	because I'm trying to win feminist poise,
950200	950760	or anything.
950760	952600	Like, do I want to attract men?
952600	953960	Yes, of course I do.
953960	955080	Do I want to attract women?
955880	956360	I guess.
956920	958120	I don't really think about it.
958120	961240	Isn't it safer to just secretly fall in love with them
961240	962680	while quietly dying inside?
963400	964840	Whatever, it's fine.
964840	967160	I want to attract non-binary people too, of course,
967160	969480	but right now you guys are kind of getting in the way
969480	972200	of my crudely stereotyping people based on gender,
972200	973880	so how dare you?
973880	975800	The point is, when I think about my appearance,
975800	977640	wanting to attract people to have sex with
977640	979720	is not the main thing going through my head.
979720	981000	What is going through my head?
987160	989240	I guess I just want to feel beautiful,
989240	990680	I want to see myself in the mirror
990680	992760	and think I look snatched, is that a crime?
992760	994360	I don't feel pretty very often.
994360	996280	I'd say it happens about once a month
996280	997800	when I'm having a good skin day,
997800	999320	I do my makeup just right,
999320	1001160	I glisten with setting spray,
1001720	1003000	and then it happens.
1003000	1004680	A tingle goes up my spine.
1005240	1006760	I am Botticelli.
1007400	1008920	I am Van Gogh.
1008920	1013920	I have created beauty, I'm a girl.
1015160	1016960	And then it's over, that's it for a month.
1016960	1018040	Usually when I look in the mirror,
1018040	1020140	I can't actually tell whether I'm pretty or not.
1020140	1021820	Like with other people, I can just look at them
1021820	1023740	and instantly make a judgment about it,
1023740	1026380	but with myself, I have to just guess.
1026380	1027820	It's the same as being a trans person
1027820	1030260	trying to figure out whether you pass.
1030260	1032100	Would you clock me?
1032100	1033160	I'd clock me.
1034100	1036100	I'd fuck me too, I don't give a shit.
1037400	1038540	Get out of my room, mom!
1038540	1039800	It doesn't work like that for me.
1039800	1041960	I have to rely on other people's feedback.
1041960	1044160	Of course, the problem with other people's feedback
1044160	1046500	is that people are liars.
1046500	1048760	You look great, hon.
1048760	1051300	Especially when those people are your fans.
1051300	1052860	Boots the house queen, stuff in my throat,
1052860	1054180	mother, I'll die for you.
1054180	1055060	Oh my God.
1055060	1056300	Or when they're your haters.
1056300	1058300	Your disgusting giant collarbone
1058300	1061380	outs you as a man at a thousand paces.
1061380	1063300	I guess I'll never know whether I'm pretty or not.
1063300	1066340	But I can estimate, like I have figured out
1066340	1068040	that I'm too pretty for Twitter,
1068040	1071160	but I'm not sure yet if I'm pretty enough for Instagram.
1071160	1072500	It's hard being a six.
1072500	1074800	I have been dipping my toes in the Instagram water.
1074800	1077220	Before my surgery, I got into a pretty good rhythm
1077220	1079260	of posting my shitty little makeup looks,
1079260	1080980	and what I find addictive about it
1080980	1083480	is this constant flow of positive comments
1083480	1086500	from other people, even though I know it's mostly flattery.
1086500	1089500	You invented beauty, perfect angel, choke me, mommy.
1089500	1090920	Every time I get a comment like that,
1090920	1093480	I'm perfectly aware that it's wild exaggeration
1093480	1095500	fueled by parasocial delusions,
1095500	1098040	but I still get a hit of dopamine in my biologically-fueled,
1098040	1099080	female brain.
1099080	1101080	And the intoxicating thing about Instagram
1101080	1104100	is that the embellishment of the truth is a two-way street,
1104100	1106220	thanks to the miracle of Facetune.
1106220	1108500	Yes, we finally get to talk about the phones.
1108500	1110720	See, it's a black mirror because it's a window
1110720	1112780	into the darkness of the human soul.
1112780	1113620	Get it?
1113620	1114800	Should I explain it again?
1114800	1116760	Phones live in a society.
1116760	1118580	Facetune is an app that lets you fix
1118580	1120080	all the problems with your face.
1120080	1122840	So here's an unedited pre-FFS picture of me.
1122840	1125420	What I would do in Facetune is smooth out the complexion,
1125420	1127960	shrink the nose a little, bring the jaw in,
1127960	1130640	and use the vibrance tool to make the eyeshadow pop.
1130640	1132000	It's really no more drastic
1132000	1134200	than the kinds of photo doctoring people have been doing
1134200	1135900	since the invention of photography.
1135900	1138360	What's changed is that now everyone is doing it
1138360	1140540	to their own photos every day.
1140540	1142420	And I've noticed that when I'm in the habit
1142420	1144660	of editing my flaws out of pictures,
1144660	1146980	when I look at an unedited picture of myself,
1146980	1148500	or when I look in the mirror,
1148500	1151380	my eyes go straight to the flaws.
1151380	1153680	Why are my pores so big?
1153680	1157120	Why aren't medical scientists doing something to stop this?
1157120	1159640	Is this really a good use of my mental energy?
1159640	1161080	Here comes that guilt again.
1161080	1162660	Instead of worrying about my pores,
1162660	1164300	shouldn't I be helping stop
1164300	1165980	the impending climate catastrophe
1165980	1167400	that's gonna destroy the planet
1167400	1169880	if we don't change the economy in like 12 years?
1169880	1171520	Shit, I guess it's 11 years now.
1171520	1173240	It's just hard to focus on climate change
1173240	1174980	when there's so much else on my mind.
1180920	1182100	He's just so cute.
1182100	1184420	I guess I'd just rather think about the aesthetic
1184420	1185780	than the apocalypse.
1185780	1186840	And that's the darkness.
1187120	1189740	Why is my neck like two decades older
1189740	1191820	than the rest of my skin?
1191820	1193500	Do I need Botox yet?
1193500	1194860	Should I get a facelift?
1194860	1196440	These are the questions that will no doubt
1196440	1198580	define the next couple decades of my life.
1198580	1200520	As if it wasn't bad enough to have to go
1200520	1202840	through a second adolescence on camera,
1202840	1204700	I also have to deal with aging,
1204700	1207400	and thus the ritual of skincare products.
1207400	1208900	Here's my daytime routine.
1208900	1211900	So first, I'm gonna mix the Dermalogica exfoliator
1211900	1215020	with the cleansing gel and just massage my face.
1215020	1216560	None of this is sponsored, by the way.
1216560	1218460	This is just me supporting corporations
1218460	1220100	out of the kindness of my heart.
1221200	1222660	Now, if I'm not running late for something,
1222660	1224160	I will do a face mask.
1224160	1226200	But if I'm out of bed,
1226200	1227980	it's because I'm running late for something.
1227980	1232440	So I've never done a face mask.
1232440	1235300	Now, I'm gonna use a toner, which is very important.
1235300	1237660	Now, a lot of people don't know what a toner does,
1237660	1242660	but look, it tones okay.
1242880	1244820	Do you want your face to be untoned?
1244820	1245680	Next, I'm gonna spray
1245680	1248700	the expensive Korean yeast directly into my eyes.
1249560	1251200	I use this because it's actually a lot cheaper
1251200	1252700	than the Japanese yeast,
1252700	1254860	so you're really losing money if you don't buy it.
1254860	1256060	Think of the savings.
1256060	1257960	Now, I'm gonna mix a pump of hyaluronic acid
1257960	1262300	with a couple spritzes of organic Bulgarian rose water.
1262300	1265140	You can almost smell the Bulgarian rose fields.
1265140	1265980	It's enchanting.
1265980	1266820	It's like I'm there.
1266820	1269320	There's not enough serum in the world for this neck leather.
1269320	1271840	I use this moisturizer because Gigi Gorgeous told me to,
1271840	1274320	and I do everything Gigi says.
1274320	1275520	Every fucking thing.
1275680	1277460	I know it seems like a lot of products,
1277460	1281120	but once you get locked into a serious skincare collection,
1281120	1283360	the tendency is to push it as far as you can.
1283360	1285040	I feel like I'm forgetting something.
1285040	1286440	A sunscreen.
1286440	1288440	I'm not really sure what this does.
1288440	1289460	We can probably skip it.
1289460	1291040	And I'm just gonna finish it all off
1291040	1293960	with some more expensive mist.
1293960	1295500	Yes, God.
1295500	1296560	I love a good facial.
1296560	1299000	I'm so fucking wet right now.
1299000	1300340	So after all these products,
1300340	1303920	does my skin look clearer, younger, more toned?
1303920	1305520	Well, it's hard to say, but I think it does.
1305520	1308760	I would say for sure, but it certainly is moist.
1308760	1311280	This is the part where I usually just stare at my own face
1311280	1313480	for 10 minutes and contemplate the futility
1313480	1316080	of my struggle against the ravages of time.
1325680	1327520	I'm fine.
1327520	1328700	It's fine.
1328700	1330460	This is fine.
1330460	1331300	It's fine.
1335520	1340520	So, isn't beauty supposed to be fun?
1357120	1359100	I'm not having fun right now.
1359100	1360960	Why am I not having fun?
1360960	1363340	I guess I just don't feel beautiful.
1363340	1365220	And I know a lot of people think I'm pretty,
1365220	1367540	and I know a lot of other people have it worse than me,
1367540	1369120	and I know I should be grateful,
1369120	1372080	and I know I'm privileged to be able to get plastic surgery,
1372080	1374320	and I know I shouldn't care so much about this
1374320	1375340	in the first place.
1375340	1379040	But the truth is that this just eats away at me,
1379040	1382480	and I'm losing a lot of time and life to this pain.
1382480	1384820	I've been kind of depressed this past month,
1384820	1387960	and I think part of it is that on a subconscious level,
1387960	1390580	I think I was hoping that surgery would completely
1390580	1393440	change my self-image and make me like myself.
1393440	1394020	But it really hasn't.
1394020	1394860	I'm not sure.
1394860	1396860	I mean, I'm happy with the results,
1396860	1398340	I'd do it all again,
1398340	1401180	but I still feel the way I felt before.
1401180	1403400	You have to keep in mind that surgery fixes
1403400	1405380	very specific problems,
1405380	1406960	like the Adam's apple problem,
1406960	1409500	or the way my forehead looks in profile problem.
1409500	1413920	But it's really not a solution to deep psychological issues.
1413920	1415980	I still don't feel beautiful,
1415980	1418520	and I need to face the fact that I'm never going
1418520	1421240	to feel beautiful unless I change the way I think.
1421240	1423640	Because I'm trapped in a doom spiral over here,
1423640	1424740	and if I'm ever gonna get out,
1424740	1427780	I think I need to start by forgiving myself
1427780	1429600	for wanting to be beautiful.
1429600	1431760	There's lots of reasons to wanna be beautiful
1431760	1433960	besides being shallow and vain.
1433960	1436740	For one, beauty is associated with youth,
1436740	1439520	it's a symbol of life, of defiance, of death.
1439520	1442280	That's a profound thing to be concerned about.
1442280	1444840	See, I'm not a bimbo, I'm a poet.
1444840	1447540	Beauty is also associated with moral worth,
1447540	1450140	the beautiful princess versus the evil hag.
1450140	1452240	There's studies showing that conventionally attractive
1452240	1454720	people are more likely to be assumed to be happy, healthy,
1454740	1457540	healthy, and trustworthy, they're more likely to be hired.
1457540	1459440	So it's not just about Instagram likes,
1459440	1460900	this is serious stuff.
1460900	1463500	And we, the woke, we are all aware of this.
1463500	1466940	We know that beauty is power, that beauty is political.
1466940	1469280	We know that beauty standards come from the people
1469280	1471460	with privilege in an unequal society.
1471460	1474240	We know it's unjust that being light-skinned, cis,
1474240	1477100	able-bodied, or thin is considered more attractive
1477100	1480080	than being dark-skinned, trans, disabled, or fat.
1480080	1482100	We know that female beauty matters so much
1482100	1483340	because it's patriarchy.
1483340	1485960	We know that our obsession with beauty is being provoked
1485960	1488120	by advertising, the cosmetic industry,
1488120	1491060	and beauty influencers who are trying to sell us products.
1491060	1492860	We know, we know, we know all this
1492860	1494480	because we've all been sitting around
1494480	1496320	critiquing it for decades.
1496320	1500220	Because that's what leftists do, we critique things.
1500220	1503300	We are finely-tuned detectors of racism, sexism,
1503300	1507220	ableism, fatphobia, transphobia, and capitalism-run AMAC.
1507220	1509880	We notice an injustice, we problematize it,
1509880	1512780	we critique it, and then we cancel it.
1512780	1513340	But what's next?
1513340	1515120	When we're done critiquing things,
1515120	1517440	what are we supposed to do?
1517440	1520080	Because I'm aware that conventional beauty standards
1520080	1522300	are a racist, sexist, ableist, fatphobic,
1522300	1524860	transphobic social construct designed to preserve
1524860	1526780	power relations and sell products,
1526780	1529620	but does that awareness mean I desire any less
1529620	1531220	to be conventionally beautiful?
1531220	1533040	Well, no.
1533040	1534340	I want it more than ever.
1534340	1536740	The problem is that the intellectual exercise
1536740	1539460	of critiquing things doesn't usually affect
1539460	1541620	my desires very much.
1541620	1543160	So what am I supposed to do?
1543160	1544960	Sit here in silent contemplation
1544960	1547040	until my desires finally align themselves
1547040	1550200	with the interests of the international proletarian revolution?
1550200	1551920	Oh, fuck the revolution.
1551920	1553460	I want to be a pretty rich girl.
1553460	1555140	I don't want to be ContraPoints anymore.
1555140	1556840	I want to be Gigi Gorgeous.
1556840	1559520	Fighting fascists on YouTube was an idea I came up with
1559520	1561560	when I was a male alcoholic.
1561560	1563820	Unfortunately, America needs a ContraPoints right now
1563820	1567440	more than it needs a 30-year-old Gigi Gorgeous impersonator,
1567440	1569200	so I guess I'm stuck with it.
1569200	1571000	Maybe it's for the best.
1571000	1573040	Critiquing society may not change our desires,
1573040	1575760	but it can motivate us to change society.
1575760	1578620	And changing society can change our desires.
1578620	1581460	So how do we change society?
1581460	1582580	Revolution.
1582580	1584160	Well, sure, revolution.
1584160	1585900	Depending on what happens in 2020,
1585900	1588000	I'll think of grabbing a brick myself.
1588000	1590800	But failing that, I think there are ways we can work
1590800	1593360	to loosen the grip of restrictive beauty standards
1593360	1596500	without the futility of trying to stop caring how we look.
1596500	1598400	I do think representation matters,
1598400	1600420	and I think having visible beauty icons
1600420	1603040	who are dark-skinned or trans or gender nonconforming
1603040	1607200	or disabled or fat or over 35 or influencers
1607200	1608540	makes a big difference.
1608540	1610420	Beauty standards are social constructs,
1610420	1612560	and social constructs can change.
1612560	1614600	That's why it's so important to recognize
1614600	1618220	that influencers are just as valid as other celebrities.
1618220	1619820	But the problem with changing society
1619820	1621320	is that it takes a long time,
1621320	1623160	and this video is almost over.
1623160	1626420	Where I can see an escape from my particular doom spiral
1626420	1629940	is in style as an alternative ideal to beauty.
1629940	1632860	You can be stylish at any age, you can be stylish
1632860	1634240	whether you pass or not.
1634240	1637360	Style is a way of cultivating a personal aesthetic
1637360	1639220	that you have complete control over.
1639220	1642620	It's like art in that originality is a virtue.
1642620	1645080	Style is an individual aesthetic,
1645080	1648220	unlike the collective aesthetic of beauty standards.
1648220	1651200	As the poet Wordsworth said about artistic appreciation,
1651200	1653240	"'Every author, as far as he is great
1653240	1655080	"'and at the same time original,
1655080	1657800	"'has had the task of creating the taste
1657800	1659800	"'by which he is to be enjoyed.'"
1659800	1661000	So even if you don't conform
1661000	1662680	to conventional beauty standards,
1662680	1664920	through the power of original style,
1664920	1666860	you can create the taste
1666860	1669440	by which your unique beauty is to be appreciated.
1669440	1672480	Society may frown upon us six-foot trannies,
1672480	1675640	but if I know I'm dressed well or my makeup is snatched,
1675640	1679000	I can easily abide any comment, any stare.
1679000	1682300	I can be misgendered a Dairy Queen for all I care.
1682300	1683920	It does not matter.
1683920	1685480	I can strut with confidence
1685480	1688300	because I am basking in the regal knowledge
1688300	1690920	of my own aesthetic superiority.
1690920	1692220	Bow before me, peasants!
1692220	1694220	I proclaim to the drive-through window,
1694220	1697220	for I am serving a lurk.
1697220	1700220	Sir, this is a Dairy Queen.
1700220	1702220	So, I guess that's the solution.
1702220	1706220	I can't believe I single-handedly ended capitalism.
1706220	1707220	Now, does that mean I'm not gonna get
1707220	1709220	a lot of expensive plastic surgery?
1709220	1710220	Fuck no!
1710220	1712220	What do you people think I am,
1712220	1714220	some kind of transgender Mother Teresa?
1714220	1715220	Goddamn.
1715220	1717220	The audacity of you people.
1717220	1718220	The hubris.
1718220	1720220	Look, I need plastic surgery because I have no style.
1720220	1721220	In fact, after the month of surgery,
1721220	1723220	you should be grateful I'm wearing clothes at all.
1723220	1724220	So, that's it for me.
1724220	1726220	I guess I have nothing but the decay of time and age
1726220	1727220	to look forward to.
1727220	1729220	I guess I'll just have to find my self-worth
1729220	1732220	in cultivating kindness, intelligence, and inner beauty.
1732220	1733220	Ew.
1733220	1734220	Gross.
1751220	1781220	
1781220	1811220	
1811220	1841220	
1841220	1848220	I'm drooling all over myself
1848220	1851220	because my jaw is still numb from the surgery.
1851220	1852220	Love that.
