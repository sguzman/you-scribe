1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,760
So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.

2
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:26,000
I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,240
You have to dial in.

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,780
Hello operator, connect me to hell.

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:41,240
This was the day that Fyre Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,100
was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.

7
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:49,620
There was a lot of hype, Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram,

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:54,760
there was a promo video full of supermodels, tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.

9
00:00:54,760 --> 00:01:00,120
One Twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption, and

10
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:06,260
many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.

11
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:12,220
So when the day arrived and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure turned

12
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:17,460
out to be two slices of pallid American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere

13
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,260
that can only be described as muddy third world shantytown, I mean, if you weren't

14
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,740
on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine.

15
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,160
The revelry.

16
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,420
Just learned about Fyre Festival, aka Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models

17
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:33,800
and rich white kids.

18
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,960
Yuppie Hunger Games hosted by Ja Rule.

19
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,200
Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fyre Festival.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,400
Instagram entitled rich kids, meet Lord of the Flies.

21
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
Let them eat salad.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,000
It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,200
You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders.

24
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,220
But at least those sandwiches were garbage.

25
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:08,180
Jamila Jameel is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.

26
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,820
Imagine looking like this.

27
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,820
Imagine being perfect.

28
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,040
Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?

29
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,560
Why are you doing this to women?

30
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,620
One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen, Jamila, your skin is so perfect,

31
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,620
uwu.

32
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,620
And Jamila replied,

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:23,660
My skin is currently perfect.

34
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,200
My skin is currently clear because

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,260
A. Privileged people have more access to good quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly

36
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,400
less stressful than those with less privilege.

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,700
I also get to sleep more because of this.

38
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:41,940
All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances

39
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,940
easily.

40
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,900
B. I believe that trans rights are human rights.

41
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,660
C. I exfoliate twice a week.

42
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,660
Oh boy.

43
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,660
Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, Gorge.

44
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,660
I'll protect you, queen.

45
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,100
Could she be any more annoying?

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,940
Someone wandered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.

47
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:03,200
This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.

48
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:07,500
Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.

49
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,040
Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.

50
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,820
But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that

51
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,660
account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of the sting out of inequality.

52
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,660
I'm not saying she's not pretty.

53
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,660
I'm not saying she's not beautiful.

54
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,660
I'm just saying she's got a lot of quality.

55
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,660
Does it?

56
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:30,400
And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
your privilege.

58
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,140
A suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart, since the rich and famous

59
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:41,800
now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared to the rabble.

60
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,100
And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to

61
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,100
it.

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,100
I don't have any beauty secrets.

63
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,100
I guess I just drink lots of water.

64
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,660
Take me, mother.

65
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:57,960
A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height

66
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:00,160
of the coronavirus pandemic.

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,280
Forty and feeling so humbled and blessed.

68
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,380
There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when

69
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,300
we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.

70
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:15,200
After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised

71
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,760
my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were

72
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,660
normal for just a brief moment in time.

73
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,660
I realized that I was not alone.

74
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:26,020
I realized that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right

75
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,020
now.

76
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,900
So in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.

77
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,160
Hashtag this is 40.

78
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,580
Tag me, bitch.

79
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,680
So like Jamila, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege checking maneuver.

80
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,500
And once again, it has not gone well.

81
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:49,160
You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century bragging about being humble and letting us

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
eat cake.

83
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,080
Millions of Americans sick and suffering.

84
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,700
Standing for hours in food lines and being evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege.

85
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,400
Your tweet made ten times worse by hashtag tone deaf, humbled and blessed line, hashtag

86
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
gross.

87
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,400
Happy birthday.

88
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Mmm.

89
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,440
I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read them motherfuckin'.

90
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,800
So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about

91
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,440
was not that she had the party.

92
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
I mean, wouldn't you escape to a private island if you got that MILF money?

93
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:29,060
The problem was more that she tweeted about it, and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,

94
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,720
a little bit yikesy.

95
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,740
But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?

96
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,400
This isn't a good look.

97
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,900
We say bad optics.

98
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
Not relatable.

99
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,520
Relatable.

100
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
Relatability is not a moral category.

101
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,960
This is public relations, it's not ethics, and it definitely isn't socialism.

102
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,960
Like, I'm pretty sure Karl Marx is a socialist.

103
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said,

104
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:57,200
The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.

105
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,560
They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.

106
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,260
This should have stayed in the drafts.

107
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,260
Hashtag tone deaf.

108
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:09,520
Isn't the issue that, when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine?

109
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,280
We didn't get to have birthday parties.

110
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,000
Some people couldn't even travel to visit their dying relatives.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,580
So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was…

112
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,580
painful.

113
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:26,920
Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.

114
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:33,840
And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury

115
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:41,740
music festivals, or Kim K's birthday party, or Jameela Jamil's privileged pores, no

116
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,640
one ever uses the word envy.

117
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:49,360
It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our

118
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,360
own psychology.

119
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,860
So in this video, I want to take a long, hard look at envy.

120
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,860
What is it?

121
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,260
Where does it come from?

122
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,020
And seriously, what is Jameela Jamil's skincare routine?

123
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,480
Drop it in the comments, bestie!

124
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,600
Okay, so what is envy?

125
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:08,840
Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.

126
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,220
Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have

127
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,980
what we want, but cannot get.

128
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,980
It's not simply wanting what another person has.

129
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:24,080
That's greed, which is a much more wholesome sin.

130
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:29,340
Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,

131
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,020
it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.

132
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,100
And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy.

133
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,420
It's emulation, or admiration.

134
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,480
At worst, it's what the Bible calls coveting.

135
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,480
It covets.

136
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:47,480
Envy is something darker, it's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging

137
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,820
them what they have.

138
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:49,820
You might even hate the person.

139
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:49,940
You might even hate the person.

140
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:49,960
You might even hate the person.

141
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,420
You might even hate the person you envy, and want them to lose what they have, to be

142
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:59,660
humiliated and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.

143
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:04,520
Like Satan, who is willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John

144
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,520
Milfton.

145
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,160
It's gonna be 90 minutes of MILF jokes, kids, so strap in.

146
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,060
So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.

147
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,420
For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary

148
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,420
celibates.

149
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:22,580
Men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.

150
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:28,420
It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is beautiful, wealthy,

151
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,900
masculine men.

152
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:36,040
For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only

153
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:41,880
want to date chads, or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.

154
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,220
Gas keep, gate boss, girl light.

155
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,380
So if you're an incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's a

156
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,700
bad emulation, the aspiration to attain what another person has, or, and this is the more

157
00:08:54,700 --> 00:09:00,360
popular option, you can take the black pill, which means believing that chadhood is genetically

158
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,980
determined at birth, there is no hope, no woman will ever want you, and therefore happiness

159
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:08,160
is impossible, you may as well lie down and rot.

160
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,300
This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire Wikipedia

161
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,700
timeline dedicated to tracking them.

162
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,380
And the essential motivation for this violence is...

163
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:17,880
The black pill.

164
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,380
The black pill.

165
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:18,880
The black pill.

166
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:19,380
The black pill.

167
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,660
Inまり's day, one indication of it all, is, envy.

168
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,500
The incels failed ambition.

169
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:27,580
And sense of incurable, predestined inferiority turns venomous.

170
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,580
The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I want,

171
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,260
then no one can.

172
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,160
In the words of a murderer.

173
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:42,380
The day of retribution, is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have."

174
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:48,700
But most incels aren't murderers, most of the time envy is most harmful to the person

175
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,200
who envies.

176
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,080
The philosopher Max Scheler called it a self-poisoning of the mind.

177
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,360
There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.

178
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,560
Because the other sins are fun, right?

179
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,960
Greed, gluttony, lust.

180
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,120
That's what I call a good time.

181
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,300
But envy is misery.

182
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,360
Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.

183
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,580
Fire Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives would

184
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,320
be like without rich parents.

185
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,780
Parents, yes.

186
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,760
Rich refugee crisis.

187
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,360
We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.

188
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,620
Look around you.

189
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,380
We've got the guillotine memes.

190
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,240
We've got edgy teens tweeting eat the rich.

191
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,580
And none of this is new.

192
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,820
The slogan eat the rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,

193
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,420
Jacques Gabor, who supposedly said,

194
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:46,820
When the people have no more to eat, they will eat the rich.

195
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,640
And fair enough.

196
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,300
It's a good source.

197
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:48,980
It's a protein.

198
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,320
But take it from me, kids.

199
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,720
Cannibalism is one of those tricky things.

200
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,360
It's hard to do just once.

201
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,800
You develop a taste for it.

202
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,700
It's like they say at NA meetings.

203
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,000
Once you've wore, you just want more.

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,100
Also, who counts as the rich?

205
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
Am I the rich?

206
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,300
I certainly hope so, because I want you to eat me.

207
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Stop it.

208
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,500
See this is why I quit academia.

209
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:14,840
If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.

210
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,500
And I don't want to behave myself.

211
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,500
I want to be bad.

212
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,100
Do you want to be bad?

213
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,300
Do you want to be bad with me?

214
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,700
Let's be bad.

215
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:46,860
So you might think that envy is simply the

216
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,220
The rich.

217
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:47,560
The rich.

218
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:52,440
simply the product of inequality, and that societies that have more inequality have more

219
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:57,320
envy. I used to assume that too, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that might not

220
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:03,560
be true. Envy is a basic part of human nature. It exists in all societies and all economic systems,

221
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,120
and it begins anytime two or more people start comparing themselves.

222
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,760
Part 2. The Desire for Mommy's Milk

223
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:19,640
According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, Daddy, the first stage of human development is

224
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:25,560
the oral stage, in which the primary concern is oral gratification, which is of course provided

225
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,040
by mommy milkies. Am I doing too much? I'll tone it down, just a little bit.

226
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,680
So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud, and it's true,

227
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:40,600
he was a bit of a crackpot coke fiend who had some zany ideas. Like penis envy. Maybe there's

228
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:40,740
truth to that, but I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

229
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:40,880
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Hmm.

230
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,260
Transgender men who experienced that. But I don't think it's a basic

231
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,140
factor for the female condition. As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?

232
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,900
Because I take that personally. I'm giving it very serious consideration, doctor,

233
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:57,780
but I feel like even when Freud is wrong he's often at least onto something. Like,

234
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,460
with the oedipus complex, it's not that you literally desire your mother right that would

235
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:10,580
be weird, it's more that you desire an archetype. Mother. Right? Mommy. You guys get it. Gen Z

236
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:15,360
tiktok lesbians get it they're the ones who got me started on this milf shit i'm a reverse socrates

237
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,180
i've been corrupted by the young my innocent and delicate nature has been defiled so freud says

238
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:26,900
that in the first two years of life libido is primarily focused on mommy's milk and it's also

239
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:33,340
in this stage that envy first emerges so i was the oldest child in my family and i was less than two

240
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:37,900
years old when my brother was born so i don't remember this because i was one year old but my

241
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:44,040
family tells me that when my brother was born i was just insanely jealous oh and i guess now is a

242
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,260
good time to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy scholars agree that there is a

243
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:55,780
difference and usually and usually they describe the difference in one of two ways the first is

244
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,740
that jealousy is defensive it's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours

245
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:07,060
whereas envy is offensive it's resentment over what someone else has that you lack and the second

246
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:07,880
difference is that

247
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,220
envy is between two people the envier and the envied whereas jealousy typically involves three

248
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:19,080
people as in romantic jealousy where you have the subject the romantic object and then the rival and

249
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:24,020
the subject is jealous of the rival because they're protective of their relationship with the romantic

250
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:29,340
object and that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry just substituting the romantic object

251
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:34,080
for mommy of course in ordinary english people are always going to say jealousy when they really mean

252
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,860
envy probably because jealousy has less negative connotations

253
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:42,880
and i think it's pointless to try to fight that like i wouldn't go around correcting people but

254
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,800
just keep in mind that there is a difference so sibling rivalry is that envy or jealousy well i

255
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,240
think it's both because initially you're defensive of your privileged only child relationship with

256
00:14:54,240 --> 00:15:00,160
your parents but a new baby often gets more attention at least in your paranoid toddler brain

257
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,000
and you might be envious of that and in romantic jealousy you may also envy the rival if she has

258
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,720
qualities that you wish you had

259
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,200
you know young kids are little egotists who are very sensitive to when another child might be

260
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:20,480
getting preferential treatment one of the favorite phrases of tiny babies is it's not fair it's not

261
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:29,360
fair tell me about it bambino and i've got bad news life is not getting any more fair than this

262
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,400
according to the bible one of the first events in human history is the story of cain

263
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,680
i don't know why

264
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:42,080
i said it in spanish i guess i just thought it would sound cool was i wrong

265
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:49,920
it just sounds so much better than cain king and abel cain and abel god tells cain and abel

266
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:57,440
each to make a sacrifice and then god prefers abel's you know because god loves meat then

267
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,760
in an act of malicious envy toward abel in spite towards god the father

268
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,600
kain kills his younger brother in my earliest memories of my brother i already loved him

269
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,320
and i don't remember the envy so i guess i wasn't a cain cain

270
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
so i must have somehow worked through this without resorting to murder

271
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:23,900
freud says that the older sibling's envy of the younger leads to a recognition of impotence because

272
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,940
at first you selfishly want to be the special most loved child but you see that your parents love

273
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:35,340
your sibling just as much as you and you're powerless to do anything about it so your ambition

274
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:42,460
to superiority fails and so you have no choice but to repress your ambition to superiority as well as

275
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:49,340
your envy and the result of that repression is what we could call herd instinct solidarity this

276
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:55,260
feeling of identifying with a group the equal siblings and as you get older the herd instinct

277
00:16:55,260 --> 00:17:01,980
evolves into feelings about justice duty community and equality but freud thought these feelings

278
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:09,660
retain a vestige of repressed envy if i can't be the favorite if i can't have special privileges

279
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:17,980
then no one can and from these observations freud made the generalization social justice means that

280
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:26,140
we deny ourselves many things so that others may have to do without them as well okay so we don't

281
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:31,900
want other people to have anything we can't have so we enviously insist on equality

282
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:37,580
as a defense against the greater prosperity of others now i don't think i completely agree with

283
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:42,220
that like i think freud is definitely onto something here but don't some of our community

284
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:50,700
feelings also come from a place of genuine care for other people i cared for someone once

285
00:17:52,300 --> 00:18:01,340
wrong well we'll come back to that later let's put a pin in me for now a pin in it for now in order to

286
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:01,900
make it work for you

287
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:05,180
freud i mean let's put a pin in freud

288
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:13,980
in a 1966 book titled envy a theory of social behavior the sociologist helmut shook argued

289
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:18,860
that rather than being that is a very german name helmut shook it's putting me in a german mood

290
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:25,980
sweetie hello myna liban hoyta gifts i know yes video i just get worse at german every year shook

291
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:31,340
argued that rather than being the result of social or economic inequality envy is a universal across

292
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:37,900
all human societies including very egalitarian ones for example in tribal and village cultures

293
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:43,820
around the world there's often a concept of black magic or witchcraft which are thought to be used

294
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:48,940
by envious people to bewitch the ones they envy you're probably familiar with the concept of the

295
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:54,140
evil eye which originates in ancient greece or maybe even earlier than that cultures all over

296
00:18:54,140 --> 00:19:01,260
the world today understand the evil eye as a kind of curse cast by the malignant gaze of an enemy's

297
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,660
envious person now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious but i actually think the

298
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,140
concept of the evil eye reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy and of the social danger that it

299
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:17,580
poses you've probably seen these amulets around there's an emoji for them now which are supposed

300
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:23,180
to protect against the evil eye it's called a nazar which comes from the arabic word for sight

301
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:27,900
or surveillance similar to the origin of the english word envy which is the latin invidia

302
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,260
which just means to look at so there's an agreement across the

303
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:37,260
cultures that envy is related to sight the malevolent gaze the evil eye and these amulets

304
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,540
show that a lot of people are afraid of being envied and want to protect themselves i was just

305
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,420
watching this turkish youtube channel with an episode on the evil eye and the host explains

306
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:54,860
that for muslims it's customary to say or god has willed it when admiring a person or object

307
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,060
you know to avoid unintentionally cursing them i love that it's like no envy like no homo but no

308
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:07,660
love the top comment on that video says you want to protect yourself from the evil green eye monster

309
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:13,260
well don't tell others about your ideas goals or wishes don't be flaunting your accomplishments on

310
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:19,660
social media or posting pictures of your children that's how you avoid being jinxed see this is where

311
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:25,580
kim kardashian went wrong with her birthday post clearly no one in the kardashian cinematic universe

312
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:29,660
has ever heard of the evil eye wait i thought these people were armenians why haven't they heard

313
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,460
a thief oh

314
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:37,820
okay never mind every piece of media they've ever produced is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle

315
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:44,700
this is a particularly american thing most americans have no concept of the fear of envy

316
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,500
like there's advertisements here that literally promise if you buy this exclusive

317
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:55,980
luxury vibrator you'll be the envy of all your friends as if it's a good thing to be envied oh

318
00:20:55,980 --> 00:21:01,260
but it is not if people envy you they gossip about you right they seethe over your success

319
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:07,500
and celebrate your misfortunes being envied is basically the opposite of being loved so why would

320
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,700
anyone want to be envied well it's a contradiction of human nature on the one hand we need to be

321
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:20,220
loved but then there's this other drive in us this like homeric striving for fame and glory and

322
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:26,140
riches which is kind of in conflict with our need to be loved in a past gilded age there were stories

323
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:29,500
like citizen kane and sunset boulevard which warned what a sad and lonely life would be like in the

324
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,340
past gilded age there were stories like citizen kane and sunset boulevard which warned what a sad and

325
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:35,380
lonely thing success can become.

326
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:41,140
In ancient democratic Athens, there was a practice called ostracismos, which is the

327
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,340
origin of the English word ostracism.

328
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,460
Ostracism was a procedure where the Athenians would assemble, and each person would write

329
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,140
the name of a person they wanted to ostracize on a pottery shard called an ostracon.

330
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:58,740
And whoever got the most votes would simply be banished from the city for ten years, no

331
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,740
questions asked.

332
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,660
I love the ancient world, things were so direct.

333
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:09,780
Often this was used to remove someone who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant

334
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,980
or just annoying.

335
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,880
According to Plutarch, I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia, in one anecdote

336
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,920
about Aristides, known as Aristides the Just, who was ostracized in 482, an illiterate citizen

337
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:26,940
not recognizing him came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostracon.

338
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,300
When Aristides asked why, the man replied,

339
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:32,540
It was because he was sick of hearing him being called the Just.

340
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
It's good!

341
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
It's so good!

342
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:39,180
See, this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.

343
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,980
This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.

344
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:47,200
People in most cultures, not all, but most cultures understand that being envied is a

345
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,980
massive social liability, so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.

346
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,460
According to a Tamil saying, the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.

347
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,580
This is sometimes called Tall Poppy Syndrome.

348
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,300
Tall Poppy Syndrome.

349
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,940
Tallest poppies in the garden will be cut.

350
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:07,800
Shook argues that the fear of envy is a major inhibiting force in many societies.

351
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:12,820
In Haiti, G.E. Simpson found that a peasant will seek to disguise his true economic position

352
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,920
by purchasing several smaller fields rather than one larger piece of land.

353
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,420
For the same reason, he will not wear good clothes.

354
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:24,300
He does this intentionally to protect himself against the envious black magic of his neighbors.

355
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America, like I've known people from seriously

356
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,300
wealthy families.

357
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:35,220
They dress like gutter punks, like they're trying to pass as poor.

358
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,940
But in general, Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy, in the way many other cultures

359
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,940
do.

360
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
And I don't think that's an accident.

361
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:47,360
We're a nation of show-offs, and so the taboo against discussing envy is related to

362
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:50,540
our whole national ethos of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.

363
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,820
But though the fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely

364
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,860
still there, only repressed.

365
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:57,940
Confined to the realm of dreams and art.

366
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:58,940
The fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely still

367
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:00,580
there, only repressed.

368
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:08,500
In the movie Black Swan, Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina who achieves her dream of getting

369
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:13,920
the lead role in Swan Lake, after which her life and mind are totally unraveled by fear

370
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,180
of envy.

371
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,220
Black magic, black swan.

372
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:22,420
At first we see how Nina's success comes at the very real cost of being envied.

373
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:27,900
By her ex-ballerina mother, by the other girls in the company, and by the former lead ballerina

374
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,900
she's replaced.

375
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,940
Did you suck his c**k?

376
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Not all of us have to.

377
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,940
I love Winona Ryder so much.

378
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,940
I love Natalie Portman so much.

379
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
I love Mila Kunis so much.

380
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
I just like women.

381
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,940
Where's my shock wand?

382
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:36,940
Stop it.

383
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
Stop stanning.

384
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia, as Nina begins hallucinating black swan doppelgangers

385
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,940
and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis, who's trying to steal her role.

386
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,940
You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.

387
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,940
They'll getcha.

388
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,940
Did you hear that?

389
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:43,940
I don't.

390
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
I don't.

391
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
I don't.

392
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,940
I don't.

393
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
I don't.

394
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:48,940
I don't.

395
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
I don't.

396
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
I don't.

397
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
I don't.

398
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:52,940
I don't.

399
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
I don't.

400
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,940
I don't.

401
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:55,940
I don't.

402
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
I don't.

403
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,940
I don't.

404
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:58,940
I don't.

405
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
I don't.

406
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,940
I don't.

407
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,940
I don't.

408
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,940
Stop.

409
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,140
You could argue that Nina is actually suffering a kind of self-envy, where she envies the

410
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:13,560
disinhibited, sexually liberated, corrupted part of herself that's capable of adult eroticism

411
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,160
and also of dancing the black swan.

412
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,020
So she imagines that part of herself as an envious rival who's trying to replace her.

413
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,900
It's like her mind is split between two impulses.

414
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:30,780
There's her dominant White Swan Impulse, which we could call the Squidward personality, perfectionistic

415
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:35,240
and orderly, but reserved, priggish, stiff.

416
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,520
And then there's her repressed Black Swan Impulse, which we could call the SpongeBob

417
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:45,180
personality, intuitive, chaotic, ecstatic.

418
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:51,300
In SpongeBob SquarePants, the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy, stemming

419
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
from failed ambition.

420
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:56,480
Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.

421
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,640
Squidward aspires to artistic achievement, but remains a mediocrity, partly because of

422
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,760
his overly dry, doctrinaire attitude towards art.

423
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,180
SpongeBob is Squidward's social equal, they're literally neighbors, and they both work the

424
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,580
same fast food service job for the same exploitative capitalist.

425
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:20,020
But SpongeBob is a Mozartian intuitive genius, who's able to transform the most mundane

426
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,280
activities, glowing bubbles, flippin' bubbles, into the world of art.

427
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:26,060
From flipping burgers, into a kind of aesthetic rapture.

428
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:31,840
Squidward intensely envies SpongeBob's uninhibited joy and intuitive creativity, but he can't

429
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,500
admit that envy to himself.

430
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:40,240
So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling is contempt, snobbish disdain for

431
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,660
SpongeBob's childish behavior.

432
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:47,220
What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.

433
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,520
Though deep down, Squidward really wants what SpongeBob has.

434
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
It's beautiful!

435
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,060
It's beautiful!

436
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,800
Uh, I mean, uh.

437
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:58,320
Which we see when he can't help himself from blowing bubbles, or when he trades away

438
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,480
all of his possessions for the chewing gum wrapper that in SpongeBob's hands was a

439
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,520
source of infinite entertainment.

440
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,380
A lot of people my age who watched SpongeBob as a kid rewatch it now, and are horrified

441
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:14,600
to discover that they identify with Squidward, whereas as children, they identified with

442
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
SpongeBob.

443
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,660
Well, you either die as SpongeBob, or you live long enough to see yourself become the

444
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Squidward.

445
00:27:19,660 --> 00:27:20,660
Future!

446
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:21,520
And there's a lot more to it.

447
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,840
And there's a pain in becoming Squidward, which is usually explained as the disappointing

448
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,400
drudgery of adult life, or simply loss of childhood.

449
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:35,840
I would argue that envy of childhood is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.

450
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
Squidwardian?

451
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,840
Are we saying that word?

452
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,260
Are we really saying that word out loud?

453
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,920
To an audience of millions?

454
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Okay!

455
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:48,520
It's basically the same dynamic as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.

456
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,520
Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart!

457
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Oh my god!

458
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Oh my god!

459
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,520
It's the evil eye!

460
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:53,520
You gotta watch out for that one, kids!

461
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,680
If a mysterious stranger shows up on your doorstep at midnight asking you to compose

462
00:27:57,680 --> 00:28:01,420
a requiem math for your own father, just say no!

463
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:07,540
So in SpongeMadeus Mozart pants, we have a diligent-tho-stuffy wannabe envying the effortless

464
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,220
playfulness of the spontaneous genius.

465
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,220
Ah!

466
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
Ah!

467
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,220
Ah!

468
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,220
Ah!

469
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,220
Ah!

470
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,220
Ah!

471
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,220
Ah!

472
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Ah!

473
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,220
Ah!

474
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Ah!

475
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:28,000
So Squidward's envy of SpongeBob is, well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.

476
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,380
Look, if we were to view SpongeBob SquarePants through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche,

477
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,300
stay with me ladies, I have an angle here,

478
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,480
we could say that Squidward represents what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse,

479
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,320
while SpongeBob represents the Dionysian.

480
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,300
Nietzsche thought there were two conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.

481
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:50,840
The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo, is the drive towards self-control,

482
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,360
order, logic, morality.

483
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:59,900
And the Dionysian, named after Dionysus, is the drive toward intoxication, frenzy, passion,

484
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:00,600
intuition.

485
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:05,520
Both SpongeBob and Amadeus present these two drives in conflict,

486
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,020
with the Apollonian envying the Dionysian.

487
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,260
Of course, this is a misrepresentation of how art is actually created,

488
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:16,280
because Nietzsche's whole point is that you need a balance

489
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,400
of the two drives.

490
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,780
In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist like SpongeBob,

491
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,740
because creating good art requires at least some level of discipline in ordering.

492
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,120
See? It is all in the technique.

493
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,480
Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.

494
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,120
Get off the stage!

495
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,520
So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.

496
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,920
In order to give the perfect performance,

497
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,740
Mina has to unify her fragmented personality and dance both swans,

498
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,220
resolving the envious rivalry between her

499
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,220
and the two artistic impulses.

500
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:49,800
It was perfect.

501
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,920
Another movie about fear of envious ballerina doppelgangers

502
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,840
Can you guess it?

503
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:05,040
is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us,

504
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:10,800
which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and fear of the American middle class.

505
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:15,580
We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family with a vacation house

506
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:20,680
and a boat, along with the Tylers, a slightly better-off white family,

507
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,460
whom the Wilsons envy.

508
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,280
You saw their new car, right?

509
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,240
You had to do it.

510
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:27,660
You just had to get that thing to fuck with me, too.

511
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:33,360
One night, the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.

512
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,320
Red, the only doppelganger who can speak,

513
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,540
explains that her family is metaphysically tethered to the Wilsons,

514
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,780
living wretched and destitute versions of their lives

515
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,560
in a liminal backroom's office.

516
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:46,220
Underworld.

517
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,580
It's super-fucking-liminal.

518
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,580
I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting.

519
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,480
Not again.

520
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,380
Once upon a time, there was a girl, and the girl had a shadow.

521
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,760
The two were connected, tethered together.

522
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:04,100
When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty.

523
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:10,500
But when the shadow was hungry, she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.

524
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,400
We later find out that all over the US,

525
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,400
oh, US spells us,

526
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
hey, that's the title of the movie.

527
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,580
Ohhhh.

528
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,580
The tethered have risen up to kill their privileged doppelgangers

529
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,580
and to link arms across the country

530
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:29,580
in a dark parody of the real-world 1986 homelessness fundraiser

531
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Hands Across America.

532
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:37,580
So my reading of Us is that it's an expression of middle-class guilt about privilege

533
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,580
and fear of envy.

534
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
It's not a movie about the working class.

535
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,580
If it was a movie about the working class,

536
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,580
then the working class would be able to speak humanly.

537
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:49,580
And would not be scary monsters who make animal sounds

538
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
and stagger around like zombies.

539
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:57,580
This is a movie about the anxious middle class's nightmare of the working class.

540
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:03,580
Us represents in a self-aware way what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.

541
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,580
The fear of the envious poor.

542
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,580
Of revolution.

543
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,580
Of slave revolt.

544
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
Tell me you did not just reference Home Alone.

545
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,580
But Us diverges from other home invasion movies

546
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,580
by not just being fearful about the underclass,

547
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,580
but also guilty.

548
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,580
The idea of the tethered underclass

549
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,580
represents life as a zero-sum game

550
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,580
where every moment of your happiness

551
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,580
is bought with someone else's suffering.

552
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,580
It's an incredibly guilty fantasy.

553
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,580
An internalization of the black magic logic

554
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,580
of people who blame their own misfortunes

555
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,580
on the people they envy.

556
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,580
As Shook puts it,

557
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,580
my neighbor's harvest

558
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,580
can only have turned out better than mine.

559
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,580
And it's not just me.

560
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,580
My neighbor's harvest

561
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,580
can only have turned out better than mine.

562
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:47,580
Because he has somehow succeeded in reducing mine by black magic.

563
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,580
So the fear of envy

564
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,580
and the guilt of success

565
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,580
are repressed in American culture.

566
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,580
But they still find expression in movies.

567
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,580
Jordan Peele is kind of like the Charles Dickens

568
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,580
of the 21st century.

569
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,580
Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol.

570
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,580
A story about the guilt of the rich

571
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:05,580
if ever there was one.

572
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,580
You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts

573
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:09,580
who show him how wretched and sad

574
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:11,580
the lives of his employees are

575
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,580
and how he'll die alone

576
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
and hated by everyone

577
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,580
and his funeral is only attended by businessmen

578
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
on the condition that lunch is provided.

579
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,580
Dickens was truly the master

580
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:23,580
of scaring the rich straight.

581
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,580
So maybe fear of envy

582
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
can serve a softly regulatory function

583
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,580
by motivating charity

584
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,580
and generosity in the rich.

585
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,580
But in general, I'm suspicious of envy

586
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
as a motivation for politics.

587
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,580
Because remember,

588
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,580
the basic logic of envy is

589
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,580
if I can't have it,

590
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,580
I can't.

591
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,580
Which is a purely negative, destructive

592
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,580
style of thinking.

593
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
It's taking privileges away

594
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
not for the material benefit of the underprivileged

595
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,580
but merely for the psychological satisfaction

596
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,580
of the envious person.

597
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,580
And that's even worse

598
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,580
when you consider that envy is subjective.

599
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
It doesn't necessarily target

600
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,580
objective power and privilege.

601
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,580
So envy in politics

602
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,580
is not by any means

603
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,580
relegated to the left.

604
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,580
Conservative politics is brimming with envy.

605
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:13,580
In the debate about forgiving student loan debt,

606
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,580
you often hear people say

607
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,580
I had to pay my student loans

608
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,580
so they should too.

609
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
Debt forgiveness is not fear.

610
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,580
The logic here is

611
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:25,580
since I didn't get my student debt forgiven,

612
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:27,580
no one should.

613
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,580
It's intergenerational envy.

614
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Which is a pretty common thing.

615
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Usually older generations

616
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,580
envying the young.

617
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:37,580
Kids these days have it so easy.

618
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,580
When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast

619
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,580
and sent text messages

620
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,580
to the phone.

621
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:45,580
The feeling is basically

622
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,580
it's not fair that kids these days

623
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,580
don't have to suffer like I suffered.

624
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:51,580
Or think about the concept

625
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,580
of a welfare queen

626
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,580
which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.

627
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,580
Or the way conservatives talk about immigration.

628
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:59,580
It's all this envious suspicion

629
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,580
about illegal immigrants

630
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,580
sneaking in

631
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,580
and getting government handouts

632
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
without having to pay taxes.

633
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,580
I had to work hard for my money

634
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,580
so why should these people get a free ride?

635
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,580
What is an illegal immigrant

636
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,580
is actually like,

637
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:17,580
except in the imagination

638
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,580
of people who envy them.

639
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,580
Envy is felt more intensely

640
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
by prideful people.

641
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,580
So it's especially sharp

642
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:27,580
when it targets people

643
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
who are supposed to be beneath you.

644
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
The Jewish radical feminist

645
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,580
Andrea Dworkin

646
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:35,580
made what I think

647
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
is a pretty compelling argument

648
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,580
that both antisemitism

649
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,580
and misogyny

650
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
are the main protagonists

651
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,580
of Tolstoy's story

652
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,580
The Kreutzer Sonata

653
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:49,580
who resents that women and Jews

654
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
find a kind of paradoxical power

655
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,580
in their own oppression.

656
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
Just like the Jews

657
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,580
as they pay us back for their oppression

658
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,580
by financial domination

659
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,580
so it is with women.

660
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,580
Ah, you want us to be traitors only?

661
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:05,580
Alright.

662
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,580
As traitors we will dominate you,

663
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,580
say the Jews.

664
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,580
Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?

665
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,580
This dominance of men by women

666
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,580
is experienced by the men

667
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,580
as real. Emotionally real.

668
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,580
Sexually real. Psychologically real.

669
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,580
It emerges as the reason

670
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,580
for the wrath of the misogynist.

671
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,580
The woman appears to control sex.

672
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,580
The man needs it.

673
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,580
This causes his rage

674
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:31,580
at her perceived power over him.

675
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,580
Women control access

676
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,580
to what men want

677
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,580
which gives women a kind of indirect power

678
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,580
that some men envy.

679
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,580
They envy the sexual power

680
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,580
of women.

681
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,580
It doesn't matter to the misogynist

682
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,580
that, especially at the time

683
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,580
Tolstoy was writing,

684
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
women objectively have less power

685
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,580
in society than men.

686
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,580
He envies women because they have

687
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,580
what he desires.

688
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,580
Likewise, it didn't matter

689
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,580
to Weimar anti-Semites

690
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,580
that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.

691
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,580
Anti-Semitism is often rooted

692
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,580
in an envious obsession

693
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,580
with the disproportionate influence

694
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,580
and affluence of Jewish people.

695
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
There are no differences between men

696
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,580
which feed envy,

697
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:17,580
but subjective perception,

698
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,580
the optics of envy.

699
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,580
Magic mirror

700
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,580
on the wall,

701
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,580
who's the cuntest of them all?

702
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,580
Thou art

703
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,580
cunt, my queen.

704
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,580
But hold,

705
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:37,580
a lovely maid

706
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:39,580
I see.

707
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,580
Oh yes,

708
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,580
I see.

709
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,580
What?

710
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
In a way,

711
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
I'm kind of just in the beginning

712
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,580
of this whole transition,

713
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,580
you know, like a young little girl

714
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,580
going through all these things,

715
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,580
having a sleepover with the girls.

716
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,580
What do we do on a sleepover?

717
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,580
Do we have like pillow fights

718
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,580
and all that stuff?

719
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:05,580
Alas,

720
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
she is more cunt than thee.

721
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,580
My pussy's stunting on the gram

722
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,580
The classic 1937 Disney movie

723
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,580
Snow White and the Wicked Milf

724
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
is the story of a quote

725
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
vain and wicked queen

726
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
who obsessively envies the beauty

727
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,580
of her own stepdaughter.

728
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
Are you sure this one's for children?

729
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,580
Every day the milf queen asks the mirror

730
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,580
who's the fairest one of all

731
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,580
and the mirror responds that the queen is the fairest

732
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:31,580
till one day it says the stepdaughter

733
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Snow White is the fairest

734
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
which sends the queen into an envious fury

735
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
resulting in a series of bizarre murder attempts.

736
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,580
So first of all,

737
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,580
why don't we talk plot holes, ding?

738
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
Are we really supposed to believe

739
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,580
that this is more beautiful

740
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,580
than this?

741
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Uh, ding!

742
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,580
Isn't Snow White like 12 years old?

743
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,580
What's going on, Walt?

744
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Why don't you take a seat?

745
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.

746
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,580
It's hard to tell because she's constantly

747
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
surrounded by manlets.

748
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
But she's just so boring.

749
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:05,580
And the queen is such a baddie.

750
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,580
Step on my throat, mother.

751
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,580
This is a horny video.

752
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,580
I can feel the pulse back in my veins.

753
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:13,580
So despite the injustice done

754
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,580
to its lead milf,

755
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,580
Snow White does illustrate some interesting things

756
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,580
about envy.

757
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,580
Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft

758
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,580
as an expression of envy.

759
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,580
We have the age difference,

760
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,580
intergenerational envy,

761
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
the envy of youth.

762
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
It kind of reminds me of those millennial women

763
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need

764
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:35,580
to rage against Gen Z.

765
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,580
Pretty counterproductive since

766
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,580
if you're worried about seeming old,

767
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,580
it's probably not helping your case gorge.

768
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,580
You might wonder if there's also jealousy

769
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,580
involved with the evil queen.

770
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:47,580
Like, is she worried that the king is gonna fall in love

771
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
with his own daughter?

772
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,580
Well, I don't think so.

773
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,580
Because we never even see the king.

774
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,580
The queen doesn't mention him.

775
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
It's not about the king.

776
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
So there's no romantic jealousy involved.

777
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,580
It's just one woman envying another woman

778
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,580
over beauty for its own sake.

779
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
We stan a Bechdel test passing

780
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
movie about women hating each other.

781
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:09,580
Gatekeep? Gas Girl?

782
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:11,580
Gas Keep? Light Boss?

783
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,580
In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version,

784
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,580
the queen first tries killing Snow White

785
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:17,580
with beauty accessories,

786
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:19,580
poisoning a comb and lacing her to death

787
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,580
with a corset.

788
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,580
I wish I could die that way.

789
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,580
What's really striking is the pure

790
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
kamikaze malignity of it all.

791
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
This queen, who we know

792
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,580
is obsessed with her look,

793
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,580
is willing to transform herself with witchcraft

794
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
into an ugly old hag

795
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,580
just to give Snow White

796
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,580
the poisoned apple.

797
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:41,580
Disguising herself as an old hag

798
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,580
parallels Satan disguising himself as a serpent.

799
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:45,580
I mean, you could actually argue

800
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:47,580
that the queen is simply a persona of Satan.

801
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:49,580
It's paradise lost all over again.

802
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:51,580
Which also happens to be

803
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,580
the title of my memoir.

804
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,580
The queen is incredibly petty,

805
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,580
because even according to the, again,

806
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,580
wrong and tasteless mirror,

807
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
she's still the second most beautiful woman

808
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,580
in the world.

809
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,580
How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy

810
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,580
still be consumed by envy?

811
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,580
Well,

812
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:11,580
basically, because that's how envy works.

813
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
It's petty,

814
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
it's subjective,

815
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality

816
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:19,580
or to the absolute

817
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,580
position on the overall hierarchy.

818
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,580
So you can be the second best in the world

819
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,580
and still be

820
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,580
obsessively envious of the one

821
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:29,580
person who may barely even be above you.

822
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:31,580
In fact, there's studies showing

823
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,580
that Olympic silver medalists

824
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:35,580
are actually less satisfied with their prize

825
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:37,580
than bronze medalists.

826
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,580
Probably because the bronze medalist is just happy

827
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,580
to be on the podium at all,

828
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,580
while the silver medalist is so close to first,

829
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,580
they can't help but wonder

830
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,580
what if?

831
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth

832
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
not by comparing ourselves to any absolute

833
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
standard, but by comparing ourselves

834
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,580
to each other. And we're more likely

835
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,580
to compare ourselves to the people who are around

836
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
us than we are to people who are far away.

837
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
We could call this

838
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
the proximity effect of envy.

839
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,580
We're more likely to envy people who are

840
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
close to us, or similar to us.

841
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
Especially people we're in competition with.

842
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
That's why social media

843
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
is such a nightmare. It's an incubator

844
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
of envy, because it puts everyone

845
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
next to everyone else.

846
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
So we're all being compared, all in competition.

847
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,580
And it can destroy your

848
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,580
self-esteem, because you're comparing

849
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,580
your actual life

850
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,580
to these idealized images.

851
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,580
And it also turns public figures into

852
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,580
lightning rods for envy,

853
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:33,580
because of the numeric visibility

854
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:35,580
of popularity and success.

855
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:37,580
It's a perverse consequence

856
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,580
of the proximity effect that

857
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,580
envy within an oppressed class

858
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:43,580
is often more venomous and obsessive

859
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,580
than envy for the oppressor.

860
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:47,580
So for example, in Snow White

861
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,580
and Black Swan,

862
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,580
you have women envying other women.

863
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:53,580
Because women are often in

864
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:55,580
competition with each other.

865
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.

866
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,580
In media, there's constant portrayals of

867
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
vain and envious women.

868
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
Jealous bitches fighting

869
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,580
over men, over youth,

870
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,580
over beauty.

871
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
It's like drag queen femininity.

872
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,580
It becomes her femininity.

873
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
On guard!

874
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Bitch!

875
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,580
So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope.

876
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,580
But...

877
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
How do I put this delicately?

878
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
Sometimes reality is misogynistic.

879
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,580
Like when my eyelash won't stay glued on.

880
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,580
The patriarchy's machinations

881
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,580
are clearly to blame.

882
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:31,580
In her 1976 essay, Trashing

883
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,580
The Dark Side of Sisterhood,

884
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:35,580
feminist Jo Freeman wrote about her ostracism

885
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,580
from within the women's movement.

886
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:39,580
I've been watching for years

887
00:43:39,580 --> 00:43:41,580
and I'm starting to say as the movement

888
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,580
consciously destroys anyone within it

889
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,580
who stands out in any way.

890
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,580
And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist

891
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:49,580
Anselma del Olio.

892
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,580
And who do they attack?

893
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:53,580
Achievement or accomplishment of any kind

894
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:55,580
would seem to be the worst crime.

895
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:57,580
Do anything that every other woman

896
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:59,580
secretly or otherwise feels she could do

897
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,580
just as well, and you're in for it.

898
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,580
You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking

899
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:05,580
opportunist, a ruthless mercenary

900
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,580
out to make her fame and fortune

901
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,580
in the bodies of selfless sisters

902
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,580
who have buried their abilities

903
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:13,580
and sacrificed their ambitions

904
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,580
for the greater glory of feminism.

905
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,580
Freeman speculates.

906
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:19,580
The primary reason there have been

907
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,580
so few great women blank

908
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,580
is not merely that greatness

909
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,580
has been undeveloped

910
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,580
or unrecognized, but that women

911
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,580
exhibiting potential for achievement

912
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:31,580
are punished by both women and men.

913
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:33,580
The fear of success

914
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,580
is quite rational when one knows

915
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
that the consequence of achievement

916
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
is hostility and not praise.

917
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:41,580
So at no point in this essay

918
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,580
does Jo Freeman use the word envy.

919
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:45,580
But as usual, envy is right

920
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,580
below the surface, causing

921
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:49,580
all the trouble.

922
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
So Freeman is describing

923
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:53,580
how people from marginalized groups

924
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,580
whose ambition raises them above

925
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,580
the typical limits set by marginalization

926
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,580
are often ostracized

927
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,580
from their own communities.

928
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,580
But she has no causal explanation

929
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,580
for why this happens.

930
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,580
I have an explanation. The explanation is envy.

931
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,580
Women are more likely to envy other women.

932
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:11,580
Trans women are more likely

933
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,580
to envy other trans women.

934
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,580
Oh god, am I really gonna go there?

935
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:17,580
If we did this topic justice,

936
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
this video would be nine centuries long.

937
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,580
Angar!

938
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Bitch!

939
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,580
A lot of people assume that trans women

940
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,580
envy cis women. And there is some truth to that.

941
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,580
There definitely was a time in my life

942
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,580
when I used to envy cis women

943
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
for being cis women.

944
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:35,580
But now I kind of just don't even allow myself

945
00:45:35,580 --> 00:45:37,580
to have the thought,

946
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,580
to be a cis woman.

947
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,580
So in a way, because becoming a cis woman

948
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,580
is impossible, it's unobtainable,

949
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:45,580
I actually envy cis women less.

950
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:47,580
So trans women are more likely

951
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:49,580
to envy other trans women.

952
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,580
Because of the proximity effect

953
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,580
and because another trans woman

954
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:55,580
represents an actual possibility

955
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,580
of what I, a trans woman,

956
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,580
could become.

957
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,580
She's a standard to which I could

958
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,580
plausibly compare myself.

959
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,580
Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.

960
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,580
Am I the only one who finds it hard

961
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,580
to watch trans creators?

962
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,580
Before I realized I was a trans woman,

963
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:13,580
I fucking loved people like ContraPoints,

964
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:15,580
Nick Spears, and other trans creators.

965
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,580
But ever since I realized I was trans,

966
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:19,580
I just get this angry, resentful feeling

967
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,580
in the pit of my stomach whenever I get recommended

968
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,580
any of these videos.

969
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,580
I seriously loved ContraPoints,

970
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:27,580
but whenever I try to watch any of her videos,

971
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:29,580
I just want to scream.

972
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,580
I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.

973
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,580
I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.

974
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,580
Am I just a toxic person?

975
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,580
Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person.

976
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:39,580
At least not any worse than anyone else.

977
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,580
It's just that human nature

978
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,580
is a toxic person.

979
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:45,580
And that angry, resentful feeling

980
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,580
in the pit of your stomach

981
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:49,580
that makes you want to scream

982
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,580
and feel such a hatred has a name.

983
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,580
And the name is Envy.

984
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:55,580
I actually admire the person who wrote this post

985
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:57,580
because they're doing the best that any of us

986
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:59,580
can do, really,

987
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,580
which is noticing the feeling

988
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,580
without endorsing the feeling.

989
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,580
I wish that more people could feel things

990
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:07,580
without rushing to a rational,

991
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,580
even if they don't want to.

992
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:11,580
It isn't rationality itself,

993
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:13,580
often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious.

994
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:15,580
Sometimes people have no self-awareness

995
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,580
about it at all.

996
00:47:17,580 --> 00:47:19,580
For example, there's a certain kind of

997
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,580
boomer transsexual who complains that

998
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:23,580
when I transitioned,

999
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:25,580
I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping,

1000
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:27,580
but kids these days just waltz on in

1001
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:29,580
and walk out with hormones.

1002
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,580
It's intergenerational envy,

1003
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,580
trans addition.

1004
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:35,580
It was hard for me, so it should be hard for everyone.

1005
00:47:35,580 --> 00:47:37,580
Like the student debt-dippy.

1006
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,580
If I can't have it, no one can.

1007
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,580
And look, I do have sympathy

1008
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:43,580
and admiration for older trans people.

1009
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,580
Like, being trans in 2021

1010
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:47,580
is already the maximum

1011
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:49,580
level of adversity that I can handle.

1012
00:47:49,580 --> 00:47:51,580
I cannot imagine how hard

1013
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:53,580
it was to do this in the 80s.

1014
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,580
However, the pain of envy

1015
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,580
is not a valid argument.

1016
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,580
Envy is not sacred rage.

1017
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,580
And the malignant demands of envious people

1018
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,580
should be ignored.

1019
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,580
God, this community.

1020
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,580
The constant competition.

1021
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:09,580
The cringing.

1022
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:11,580
It makes it really hard to get along with other trans people.

1023
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,580
Oh, speaking of which.

1024
00:48:13,580 --> 00:48:15,580
Gay tangent, everybody. Gay tangent.

1025
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,580
Envy presents kind of a unique

1026
00:48:17,580 --> 00:48:19,580
problem to same-sex attracted people.

1027
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:21,580
Because of the increased risk

1028
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,580
of envying the very people

1029
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:25,580
you're attracted to.

1030
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:27,580
I wanna the ones I envy.

1031
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,580
You know, it's the classic

1032
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,580
do I want you or do I want to be you

1033
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,580
problem. I've heard feminine queer

1034
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:35,580
women say they could never date another

1035
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,580
femme because they're worried

1036
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:39,580
they would just end up envying her.

1037
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:41,580
So dating masculine women solves that

1038
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,580
problem. Because having separate roles,

1039
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:45,580
separate aesthetics, separate

1040
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:47,580
categories helps to avert

1041
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:49,580
proximity envy between

1042
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:51,580
partners. Unfortunately,

1043
00:48:51,580 --> 00:48:53,580
I am not that smart.

1044
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:55,580
Basically, I am attracted

1045
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,580
to femininity. But I also want to

1046
00:48:57,580 --> 00:48:59,580
embody a kind of feminine archetype

1047
00:48:59,580 --> 00:49:01,580
myself. I'm not masculine

1048
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:03,580
and I don't wanna be. You know, I used to think

1049
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:05,580
I'd only wanna date another trans woman

1050
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:07,580
because of the mutual understanding

1051
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,580
but I've kind of realized that at this point

1052
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,580
it may actually be more psychologically healthy

1053
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:13,580
for me to open up to dating cis women.

1054
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,580
I used to not wanna do that because I was

1055
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:17,580
afraid it would make me feel like a man. But at this point

1056
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,580
honestly, just

1057
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,580
be a man. Whatever.

1058
00:49:21,580 --> 00:49:23,580
It's fine.

1059
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,580
As a drag queen once said,

1060
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:27,580
I'm more of a man than you'll ever be. I'm more of a woman

1061
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,580
than you'll ever have. Yes, glad.

1062
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,580
Can we get the tequila out of the frame please?

1063
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,580
I think at a distance

1064
00:49:33,580 --> 00:49:35,580
it's okay to indulge the attraction

1065
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,580
emulation ambiguity. But if

1066
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,580
you wanna actually have a relationship with someone,

1067
00:49:39,580 --> 00:49:41,580
you have to make up your mind

1068
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,580
that you desire this woman

1069
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:45,580
and you do not wanna be her.

1070
00:49:45,580 --> 00:49:47,580
Because think about it from the other perspective.

1071
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:49,580
What could be less attractive

1072
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:51,580
than someone who literally wants

1073
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,580
to be you? Teacher,

1074
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,580
make her stop copying

1075
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,580
me. Like as much as I joke every

1076
00:49:57,580 --> 00:49:59,580
episode about how Buffalo Bill

1077
00:49:59,580 --> 00:50:01,580
is an iconic trans legend,

1078
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:03,580
you don't wanna date that bitch.

1079
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,580
Imagine trying to date Eve

1080
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,580
from All About Eve. Pass.

1081
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,580
Hard pass.

1082
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,580
So if you're a queer woman, or a queer anything honestly,

1083
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:13,580
and you find yourself envying your

1084
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,580
partner, my advice is

1085
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:17,580
stop overthinking a good situation.

1086
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,580
An enviable woman wanted to be with

1087
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:21,580
you. So sit back,

1088
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:23,580
relax, and enjoy

1089
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:25,580
the clout. I get it though.

1090
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,580
It's complicated.

1091
00:50:27,580 --> 00:50:29,580
We're all supposed to proudly affirm what we

1092
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:31,580
truly desire, but how do you know

1093
00:50:31,580 --> 00:50:33,580
what you truly desire? Do I want

1094
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,580
mommy? Or do I wanna

1095
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:37,580
be the mommy?

1096
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,580
Yes. Just yes.

1097
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:41,580
Anyway,

1098
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,580
let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.

1099
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:45,580
The mother half took over completely.

1100
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:55,580
Do I look okay? Is my head on

1101
00:50:55,580 --> 00:50:57,580
straight? So,

1102
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:59,580
we keep running into this avoidance

1103
00:50:59,580 --> 00:51:01,580
of the word envy.

1104
00:51:01,580 --> 00:51:03,580
And people especially cannot seem

1105
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,580
to notice when they themselves are

1106
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,580
feeling envious. Like that person who

1107
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:09,580
was puzzled over the angry, resentful

1108
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:11,580
feeling in the pit of their stomach without

1109
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,580
being able to name what they were feeling.

1110
00:51:13,580 --> 00:51:15,580
There's two reasons why people are usually in

1111
00:51:15,580 --> 00:51:17,580
denial about their own envy. One is

1112
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:19,580
guilt, and the other is shame.

1113
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:21,580
Shame. Shame

1114
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,580
because admitting to yourself that you

1115
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,580
envy someone implies

1116
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,580
that you feel inferior to them,

1117
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:29,580
which is shameful. It wounds

1118
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,580
the ego. And guilt

1119
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,580
because envy is malicious.

1120
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:35,580
If you envy someone, you may feel angry

1121
00:51:35,580 --> 00:51:37,580
and miserable about their success

1122
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:39,580
and good fortune, and you may wish

1123
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:41,580
to see them ruined or brought down.

1124
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:43,580
That's cruel and antisocial.

1125
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:45,580
It goes against most ideas

1126
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,580
of morality, and it's a thought that's

1127
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:49,580
usually not socially acceptable

1128
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,580
to admit. So envy is shameful,

1129
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,580
guilty,

1130
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,580
and socially unacceptable. And we

1131
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,580
deal with that by suppressing it

1132
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,580
from our awareness. But it is still

1133
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,580
there, and in order to maintain

1134
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:03,580
the denial, we have to convince ourselves

1135
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:05,580
that this angry, resentful

1136
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:07,580
feeling in the pit of our stomach

1137
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:09,580
is actually something else.

1138
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,580
Think about how in Spongebob,

1139
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,580
Squidward shows contempt for

1140
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,580
Spongebob's childishness

1141
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,580
for blowing bubbles, for having fun at

1142
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:19,580
work, when in fact,

1143
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:21,580
Squidward envies Spongebob's

1144
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,580
uninhibited joy and intuitive

1145
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,580
creativity. But he can't allow

1146
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:27,580
himself to have the thought that he

1147
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:29,580
envies Spongebob, because that would

1148
00:52:29,580 --> 00:52:31,580
mean recognizing the intolerably

1149
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,580
shameful truth that he

1150
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:35,580
feels inferior to Spongebob.

1151
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:37,580
So what he does instead is

1152
00:52:37,580 --> 00:52:39,580
convince himself that what he really is

1153
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:41,580
is a refined sophisticate

1154
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,580
scoffing at this childish

1155
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:45,580
fool.

1156
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,580
We could call this envy to

1157
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:53,580
contempt sublimation.

1158
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,580
Sublimation is a psychoanalytic

1159
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,580
term, which means that you transform

1160
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,580
an ego-wounding feeling

1161
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,580
or socially unacceptable longing

1162
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,580
into something more

1163
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,580
ego-flattering or socially acceptable.

1164
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,580
So the classic example used by Freud

1165
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:09,580
is the transformation of sexual

1166
00:53:09,580 --> 00:53:11,580
urges of erotic

1167
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:13,580
energy into creative

1168
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,580
expression. It's like the founder of the

1169
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:17,580
NoFap movement, Lady Gaga,

1170
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,580
once said,

1171
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:21,580
I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone,

1172
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,580
they're gonna take my creativity from me through my

1173
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:25,580
So according to Freud,

1174
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,580
the vast majority of erotic longings

1175
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:29,580
can never be fulfilled.

1176
00:53:29,580 --> 00:53:31,580
Tell me about it, Sigmund. Ugh.

1177
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,580
Misery.

1178
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:35,580
There's a positive side to this, supposedly,

1179
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,580
which is that you can sublimate your

1180
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:39,580
erotic longings into a more

1181
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:41,580
socially acceptable productivity.

1182
00:53:41,580 --> 00:53:43,580
So, you know, instead of slicking the bean,

1183
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:45,580
maybe you write novels

1184
00:53:45,580 --> 00:53:47,580
about thirsty vampires, or

1185
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,580
for that matter, philosophical treatises

1186
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:51,580
about the will to power.

1187
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,580
Oh, we'll get to you. Freud thought that

1188
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:55,580
civilization itself is built at the cost

1189
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:57,580
of our instincts, most of which

1190
00:53:57,580 --> 00:53:59,580
we have to sacrifice in order to

1191
00:53:59,580 --> 00:54:01,580
live in a society. So like erotic

1192
00:54:01,580 --> 00:54:03,580
impulses, I think envy can

1193
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,580
be sublimated, which is what's happening

1194
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,580
when it becomes contempt.

1195
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:09,580
Another example is the blog

1196
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,580
McMansion Hell, which makes fun of the

1197
00:54:11,580 --> 00:54:13,580
tasteless architecture of suburban

1198
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:15,580
ostentatious trash.

1199
00:54:15,580 --> 00:54:17,580
I would argue that part of the fun of this blog

1200
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:19,580
is the pleasure and relief

1201
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,580
of looking down

1202
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,580
at the rich.

1203
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:25,580
Because looking enviously up at the rich

1204
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:27,580
is painful. It makes you feel

1205
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,580
inferior. And a way to

1206
00:54:29,580 --> 00:54:31,580
alleviate that pain is to sublimate

1207
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,580
envy, and pretend

1208
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,580
that you're an aristocratic

1209
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:37,580
esthete, scoffing at the vulgar

1210
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,580
taste of the Ereveste.

1211
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,580
These flying buttresses are an

1212
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:43,580
extremely poor taste.

1213
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,580
Another example is shit-talking

1214
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:47,580
plastic surgery. I once heard a

1215
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,580
trans woman say, at least I don't look

1216
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,580
like a botched sex doll.

1217
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,580
The subtext is, there's a certain kind of

1218
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,580
trans woman influencer who lives in LA

1219
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,580
and has a lot of cosmetic surgery

1220
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,580
to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.

1221
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,580
But it costs a lot of money to look

1222
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,580
like this. And a lot of trans women can't

1223
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,580
afford surgeries that they want.

1224
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,580
And one way to cope with frustrated

1225
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,580
desire is to convince yourself

1226
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:11,580
that the thing that's out of reach

1227
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,580
is not worth having anyway.

1228
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:15,580
See also the discourse on Twitter

1229
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,580
about how passing is transphobic.

1230
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,580
There's an ancient Greek fable where

1231
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:21,580
a fox wants some grapes, but he can't

1232
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:23,580
reach the vine. So he walks away bitterly

1233
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:25,580
and says, well the grapes are

1234
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,580
transphobic anyway. The cisgender

1235
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:29,580
version of this is maybe the not like

1236
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:31,580
other girls meme. Which is classic

1237
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,580
envy to contempt sublimation.

1238
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,580
The trope is usually that other

1239
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:37,580
girls are popular and slutty.

1240
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:39,580
They have fake tans and fake nails.

1241
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,580
They like partying and makeup

1242
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,580
and stupid music for idiots.

1243
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,580
But I'm quirky and real.

1244
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:47,580
I listen to Pink Floyd

1245
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:49,580
and read books and eat lots

1246
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,580
of pizza late at night.

1247
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:53,580
Alone and sad.

1248
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,580
There's usually a subtext of anxiety

1249
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:57,580
about inferiority. The other girls

1250
00:55:57,580 --> 00:55:59,580
being more socially accepted,

1251
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,580
feminine, and put together.

1252
00:56:01,580 --> 00:56:03,580
A lot of times the other girls

1253
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:05,580
don't even exist, right? They're a media

1254
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:07,580
construct of idealized womanhood.

1255
00:56:07,580 --> 00:56:09,580
Like where are these other girls

1256
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,580
who've never eaten pizza and enjoy

1257
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:13,580
wearing makeup at 9am on a Saturday morning?

1258
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,580
Are they between the sofa cushions?

1259
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,580
Did you put them in with the other laundry?

1260
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,580
Are the other girls in the room with us

1261
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:21,580
right now? So the feeling of inferiority

1262
00:56:21,580 --> 00:56:23,580
toward the other girls is

1263
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:25,580
reframed as a kind of contemptuous

1264
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,580
hipster superiority. Which is

1265
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:29,580
really just an ego defensive persona

1266
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:31,580
of resentment. Like Janice

1267
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,580
in Mean Girls. She's not even really a lesbian.

1268
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:35,580
She's Lebanese.

1269
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,580
Regina got confused.

1270
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:39,580
And then she dances with a boy at the end.

1271
00:56:39,580 --> 00:56:41,580
And is readmitted into girlhood.

1272
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,580
Thank you for that Tina Fey, that's very helpful.

1273
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:45,580
Great.

1274
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:47,580
Another way we can reframe feelings of

1275
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:49,580
envious inferiority is by

1276
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:51,580
transforming them into moral

1277
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,580
superiority. Moral superiority

1278
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,580
often being the refuge

1279
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,580
of people with nothing better

1280
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,580
to feel superior about. We don't have to

1281
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,580
feel guilty or ashamed of envy

1282
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:03,580
if we convince ourselves that we're

1283
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,580
actually experiencing

1284
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,580
is justified, legitimate

1285
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:09,580
hatred. So for example,

1286
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:11,580
think of the morality around sexuality.

1287
00:57:11,580 --> 00:57:13,580
Part 69

1288
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:15,580
Sluts. Yeah, what are you gonna do

1289
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,580
about it? Cancel me?

1290
00:57:17,580 --> 00:57:19,580
On guard!

1291
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:21,580
Bitch! Why does everyone hate

1292
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:23,580
sluts so much? Sluts never did nothing

1293
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,580
wrong to nobody. Open sexual

1294
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,580
promiscuity is in a way analogous

1295
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:29,580
to opulence. You're conspicuously

1296
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,580
enjoying something that other

1297
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:33,580
people want, but may not be able

1298
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,580
to get. Many cultures have

1299
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:37,580
norms about modesty. For example,

1300
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,580
expecting women to cover their hair

1301
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:41,580
in public. This is usually explained

1302
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,580
as prophylaxis against male

1303
00:57:43,580 --> 00:57:45,580
lust, but I wonder if it also

1304
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:47,580
serves to prevent a more

1305
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:49,580
generalized envy, which female

1306
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,580
beauty has a way of attracting.

1307
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,580
Men often slut shame

1308
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:55,580
because they want to control female sexuality.

1309
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,580
And by female sexuality,

1310
00:57:57,580 --> 00:57:59,580
I do mean male sexuality.

1311
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,580
Because often what they're really struggling

1312
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,580
to control is their own

1313
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,580
desire. But slut shaming is also

1314
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,580
done pretty viciously by

1315
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:09,580
women to each other. And that's a

1316
00:58:09,580 --> 00:58:11,580
complicated thing. It's more than just

1317
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:13,580
envy. Sometimes it comes from a sense that

1318
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:15,580
a woman who's having casual sex

1319
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:17,580
with a lot of men is compromising

1320
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:19,580
the collective sex withholding

1321
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:21,580
power of the group. Almost like

1322
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:23,580
she's crossing a picket line. But there's

1323
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:25,580
also sometimes a resentment

1324
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:27,580
that a woman who's showing skin

1325
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:29,580
is using her body to get

1326
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,580
unearned attention.

1327
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:33,580
And that smells like envy to me.

1328
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:35,580
I don't use my body to get attention.

1329
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,580
So no one should.

1330
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,580
The repressed feeling is

1331
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:41,580
maybe I'm a little jealous that she's

1332
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:43,580
getting all this attention by posting

1333
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:45,580
thirst traps. But you don't think that.

1334
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:47,580
You think, I

1335
00:58:47,580 --> 00:58:49,580
am above this. Because I

1336
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:51,580
am chaste. I

1337
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:53,580
have class. I

1338
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,580
am a feminist. I would also

1339
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:57,580
suggest accusing her of pandering to the

1340
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,580
male gaze. That's, of course, the

1341
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:01,580
feminist way of calling someone a

1342
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:03,580
lowdown hobag skank.

1343
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:05,580
So again we have envy to contempt

1344
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:07,580
sublimation. And often the contempt

1345
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:09,580
is moral. Virtuous.

1346
00:59:09,580 --> 00:59:11,580
The psychological

1347
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:13,580
need to convince ourselves

1348
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:15,580
that envy is morality

1349
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:17,580
can become so strong

1350
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,580
that we actually start inventing things

1351
00:59:19,580 --> 00:59:21,580
to be outraged about. Take

1352
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:23,580
for instance the tendency to imagine

1353
00:59:23,580 --> 00:59:25,580
that the wealthy and powerful are

1354
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,580
enjoying wild satanic

1355
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,580
orgies and indulging all the

1356
00:59:29,580 --> 00:59:31,580
forbidden salacious pleasures

1357
00:59:31,580 --> 00:59:33,580
that we ourselves are denied.

1358
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,580
Like QAnon, these conspiracy

1359
00:59:35,580 --> 00:59:37,580
theorists who want us to imagine

1360
00:59:37,580 --> 00:59:39,580
Hillary Clinton reclining

1361
00:59:39,580 --> 00:59:41,580
in a garden of earthly delights

1362
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,580
sampling the pleasures of

1363
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,580
ephibes.

1364
00:59:45,580 --> 00:59:47,580
Live, laugh, love

1365
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:49,580
that for her. Envy is very

1366
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:51,580
imaginative when it comes to the

1367
00:59:51,580 --> 00:59:53,580
hedonistic extravagance of the envied.

1368
00:59:53,580 --> 00:59:55,580
Let's talk about Marie Antoinette,

1369
00:59:55,580 --> 00:59:57,580
the queen of France who was guillotined

1370
00:59:57,580 --> 00:59:59,580
by the revolution. If you know

1371
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:01,580
one thing about Marie Antoinette,

1372
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,580
it's probably that when she heard about a family

1373
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:05,580
famine where the people had no bread,

1374
01:00:05,580 --> 01:00:07,580
she infamously responded,

1375
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,580
let them eat cake.

1376
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,580
What an evil bitch.

1377
01:00:11,580 --> 01:00:13,580
How could she say that? Well,

1378
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,580
she didn't.

1379
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:17,580
She never said it.

1380
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:19,580
It's a lie. The phrase

1381
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,580
let them eat cake, originally

1382
01:00:21,580 --> 01:00:23,580
let them eat brioche, first appeared

1383
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,580
in Rousseau's Confessions, written in

1384
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:27,580
1765 when Marie

1385
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:29,580
Antoinette was nine years old.

1386
01:00:29,580 --> 01:00:31,580
Rousseau attributed the line to

1387
01:00:31,580 --> 01:00:33,580
a great princess.

1388
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:35,580
It's probably no one ever said this.

1389
01:00:35,580 --> 01:00:37,580
It's kind of like how the most famous photo

1390
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,580
of Paris Hilton is the one where

1391
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,580
she's wearing a stop being poor

1392
01:00:41,580 --> 01:00:43,580
t-shirt. What an evil

1393
01:00:43,580 --> 01:00:45,580
bitch. How could she wear that?

1394
01:00:45,580 --> 01:00:47,580
Well, she didn't.

1395
01:00:47,580 --> 01:00:49,580
It's photoshopped.

1396
01:00:49,580 --> 01:00:51,580
The actual shirt said stop being

1397
01:00:51,580 --> 01:00:53,580
desperate. Envy likes to

1398
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:55,580
fabricate the diabolical

1399
01:00:55,580 --> 01:00:57,580
crimes of its enemies. I assume

1400
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,580
to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.

1401
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:01,580
I mean, what is a Disney villain

1402
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,580
if not an opulent homosexual

1403
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,580
seen through the eyes of the envious?

1404
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,580
I'm gonna try lowering

1405
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,580
the ISO because it's so f***ing bright in here

1406
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:11,580
now. Okay, well it's a

1407
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:13,580
much lower ISO. What if I get another

1408
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,580
white over here? That's what this channel's really about.

1409
01:01:15,580 --> 01:01:17,580
One biological female's quest

1410
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,580
to create a harmonious color story.

1411
01:01:19,580 --> 01:01:21,580
In the years leading up to and

1412
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:23,580
during the French Revolution,

1413
01:01:23,580 --> 01:01:25,580
Marie Antoinette was constantly defamed

1414
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,580
in these sleazy tabloids

1415
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:29,580
called libelle.

1416
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,580
It's the same root as the English word libel.

1417
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,580
The often pornographic libelle

1418
01:01:33,580 --> 01:01:35,580
depicted the queen as a bisexual

1419
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,580
demon who was constantly having

1420
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,580
drunken orgies and sexually manipulating

1421
01:01:39,580 --> 01:01:41,580
everyone around her. All of which

1422
01:01:41,580 --> 01:01:43,580
is very interesting, but

1423
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,580
none of which is true.

1424
01:01:45,580 --> 01:01:47,580
The historian Robert Darnton called it

1425
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,580
an avalanche of defamation

1426
01:01:49,580 --> 01:01:51,580
that has no parallel in the

1427
01:01:51,580 --> 01:01:53,580
history of vilification. This

1428
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,580
woman took the blame,

1429
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,580
the moral blame, for the

1430
01:01:57,580 --> 01:01:59,580
structural failings of a broken

1431
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:01,580
economic system. And by the time

1432
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:03,580
she was brought before the revolutionary tribe

1433
01:02:03,580 --> 01:02:05,580
in 1793,

1434
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,580
the actual person Marie Antoinette

1435
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:09,580
had long ago been overshadowed

1436
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,580
by the libellous caricature of her.

1437
01:02:11,580 --> 01:02:13,580
Now there was maybe one

1438
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,580
good reason for executing the former

1439
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:17,580
queen, which is that the legitimacy

1440
01:02:17,580 --> 01:02:19,580
of your new republic is a

1441
01:02:19,580 --> 01:02:21,580
little more secure when you don't have

1442
01:02:21,580 --> 01:02:23,580
living monarchs hanging around.

1443
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:25,580
Someone better tell the English.

1444
01:02:25,580 --> 01:02:27,580
But the problem with that reasoning

1445
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,580
is it has nothing to do with whether

1446
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,580
or not the queen deserved

1447
01:02:31,580 --> 01:02:33,580
to die. And beheading a recently

1448
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:35,580
widowed mother of two in front of

1449
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:37,580
a jeering crowd for political expediency

1450
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:39,580
might weigh a little

1451
01:02:39,580 --> 01:02:41,580
heavy on the conscience.

1452
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:43,580
So the revolution had to convince themselves

1453
01:02:43,580 --> 01:02:45,580
that the queen deserved it.

1454
01:02:45,580 --> 01:02:47,580
Which was pretty easy after decades

1455
01:02:47,580 --> 01:02:49,580
of, again, false and

1456
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,580
defamatory gossip. In her biography

1457
01:02:51,580 --> 01:02:53,580
of Marie Antoinette, Antonia

1458
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:55,580
Frazier describes how

1459
01:02:55,580 --> 01:02:57,580
the prison guards separated Marie

1460
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,580
from her eight-year-old son, who they

1461
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:01,580
plied with alcohol and groomed

1462
01:03:01,580 --> 01:03:03,580
into accusing his own mother

1463
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,580
of incestuous abuse.

1464
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,580
To justify killing Marie

1465
01:03:07,580 --> 01:03:09,580
Antoinette, they had to destroy

1466
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,580
the idea of this woman

1467
01:03:11,580 --> 01:03:13,580
as a mother. So she was convicted

1468
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,580
of what may as well have been

1469
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:17,580
crimes against ethics in games journalism

1470
01:03:17,580 --> 01:03:19,580
and sent to the guillotine

1471
01:03:19,580 --> 01:03:21,580
where her last words were

1472
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:23,580
sorry to the executioner for

1473
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,580
stepping on his foot.

1474
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,580
Uh, women stop

1475
01:03:27,580 --> 01:03:29,580
apologizing challenge. This is what a

1476
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:31,580
girl boss winning looks like.

1477
01:03:31,580 --> 01:03:33,580
So Marie Antoinette literally

1478
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:35,580
did nothing wrong.

1479
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,580
Hey, how are you?

1480
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,580
An innocent milf was killed

1481
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,580
that day and I, for one,

1482
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,580
won't stand for it.

1483
01:03:43,580 --> 01:03:45,580
So look, we have a

1484
01:03:45,580 --> 01:03:47,580
psychological incentive

1485
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:49,580
to believe that people whom

1486
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:51,580
we envy are immoral monsters.

1487
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,580
Because then, we get to label our

1488
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:55,580
hatred and violence toward them justice.

1489
01:03:55,580 --> 01:03:57,580
Cruelty generally

1490
01:03:57,580 --> 01:03:59,580
cannot conceptualize itself

1491
01:03:59,580 --> 01:04:01,580
as cruelty. And part of the

1492
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:03,580
reason for that is that calling

1493
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,580
cruelty what it is

1494
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:07,580
takes the fun out of it.

1495
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:09,580
It reminds me of the second best day

1496
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,580
in the history of Twitter.

1497
01:04:11,580 --> 01:04:13,580
October 1st, 2020.

1498
01:04:13,580 --> 01:04:15,580
The day that Trump got COVID.

1499
01:04:15,580 --> 01:04:17,580
And I'm gonna be honest, I have never

1500
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,580
felt more schadenfreude

1501
01:04:19,580 --> 01:04:21,580
in my entire life.

1502
01:04:21,580 --> 01:04:23,580
Well, well, well.

1503
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:25,580
If it isn't the leopards eating people's faces

1504
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:27,580
party having their faces eaten by

1505
01:04:27,580 --> 01:04:29,580
leopards.

1506
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,580
Last time I ate cake.

1507
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,580
Like Dan Savage said,

1508
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,580
it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.

1509
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:41,580
The next day, I tweeted,

1510
01:04:41,580 --> 01:04:43,580
These last 24 hours have been the first time

1511
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:45,580
I've genuinely enjoyed Twitter in years.

1512
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:47,580
Because this website is good for one thing only,

1513
01:04:47,580 --> 01:04:49,580
reveling in the cruelest of human impulses.

1514
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:51,580
And someone responded to that

1515
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,580
saying,

1516
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:55,580
Oh my god, could you even be

1517
01:04:55,580 --> 01:04:57,580
a bigger killjoy?

1518
01:04:57,580 --> 01:04:59,580
But why was I being a killjoy?

1519
01:04:59,580 --> 01:05:01,580
The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.

1520
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,580
Well, for most people, I guess not

1521
01:05:03,580 --> 01:05:05,580
me, but for normal people,

1522
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:07,580
for other girls, cruelty is only

1523
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:09,580
pleasurable as long as they can convince

1524
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,580
themselves it's something other than

1525
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,580
cruelty. Justice served.

1526
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:15,580
So again, reason,

1527
01:05:15,580 --> 01:05:17,580
rationality, are often the attempt

1528
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,580
to publicly communicate,

1529
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:21,580
to evangelize our

1530
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,580
private feelings. And morality,

1531
01:05:23,580 --> 01:05:25,580
ethics, and justice

1532
01:05:25,580 --> 01:05:27,580
are often put forward

1533
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,580
as the respectable public

1534
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:31,580
face of private

1535
01:05:31,580 --> 01:05:33,580
envy, vindictiveness,

1536
01:05:33,580 --> 01:05:35,580
and hatred. But is this a

1537
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:37,580
corruption of morality?

1538
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:39,580
Or have we stumbled onto something

1539
01:05:39,580 --> 01:05:41,580
darker? What if morality

1540
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,580
itself is simply the

1541
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,580
expression of some kind of

1542
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:47,580
sadomasochistic urge?

1543
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:49,580
It's too early for this.

1544
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:51,580
I mean, it's literally 7am

1545
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:53,580
where I'm filming. I don't know how this keeps

1546
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:55,580
happening to me. My head gets cut off one afternoon,

1547
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,580
puts me in a philosophical mood.

1548
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,580
The next morning,

1549
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,580
I've stayed up all night and I'm still talking about

1550
01:06:01,580 --> 01:06:03,580
the philosophes.

1551
01:06:03,580 --> 01:06:05,580
Meow meow.

1552
01:06:05,580 --> 01:06:07,580
Hello again, kittens.

1553
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:09,580
Let's talk about justice, uwu.

1554
01:06:09,580 --> 01:06:11,580
I look like a Supreme Court justice.

1555
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,580
So nya? So to meow your?

1556
01:06:13,580 --> 01:06:15,580
It would actually be fierce if I wasn't,

1557
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,580
you know, if I wasn't being nyadily.

1558
01:06:17,580 --> 01:06:19,580
Look, I've been seeing a lot

1559
01:06:19,580 --> 01:06:21,580
of comments lately along the lines of

1560
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,580
Natalie used to do serious

1561
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25,580
academic arguments. Now she

1562
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,580
only cares about makeup.

1563
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,580
Alright, you little shits. You want

1564
01:06:29,580 --> 01:06:31,580
book learning? I'm gonna learn you so

1565
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:33,580
hard. I'm gonna learn you so hard you're gonna

1566
01:06:33,580 --> 01:06:35,580
have a god damn

1567
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:37,580
headache in the morning. Friedrich

1568
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:39,580
Nietzsche. Friedrich

1569
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:43,580
Wilhelm Nietzsche. Do you mind if I call you Fred?

1570
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,580
Friedrich was a German philosopher

1571
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:47,580
who had a lot to say about

1572
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:49,580
envy and morality. But before

1573
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,580
we get into that, I want to say a little bit about his

1574
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,580
life, because it's just very

1575
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:55,580
funny. Nietzsche's famous for his concept

1576
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:57,580
of the Ubermensch, but Friedrich

1577
01:06:57,580 --> 01:06:59,580
sweet,

1578
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:01,580
beautiful little Friedrich,

1579
01:07:01,580 --> 01:07:03,580
he was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.

1580
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:05,580
Friedrich was a chronically

1581
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:07,580
ill, chronically in pain,

1582
01:07:07,580 --> 01:07:09,580
nearly blind incel

1583
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:11,580
who probably slept with a prostitute

1584
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,580
once and got syphilis and

1585
01:07:13,580 --> 01:07:15,580
died. Life is

1586
01:07:15,580 --> 01:07:17,580
funny. Sad, but funny.

1587
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,580
In the introduction to Beyond

1588
01:07:19,580 --> 01:07:21,580
Good and Evil, the editor says

1589
01:07:21,580 --> 01:07:23,580
though he prided himself on being

1590
01:07:23,580 --> 01:07:25,580
comfortable with women, he does not seem to have been

1591
01:07:25,580 --> 01:07:27,580
very successful in establishing emotionally

1592
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,580
satisfying relationships with them,

1593
01:07:29,580 --> 01:07:31,580
which is hardly surprising.

1594
01:07:31,580 --> 01:07:33,580
I love when the introduction to a book is just a

1595
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:35,580
brutal roast of the author.

1596
01:07:35,580 --> 01:07:37,580
Who wrote this? Rolf Peter Horstmann.

1597
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,580
You're killing it, Rolf. You're a savage.

1598
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:41,580
I adore. Friedrich's books

1599
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:43,580
sold a dismal number of copies

1600
01:07:43,580 --> 01:07:45,580
in his lifetime. What emerges

1601
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:47,580
is a picture of a totally isolated,

1602
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,580
highly neurotic man who had

1603
01:07:49,580 --> 01:07:51,580
to try hard to avoid thinking of

1604
01:07:51,580 --> 01:07:53,580
himself as a complete failure.

1605
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,580
Aww. He was also doing huge doses of

1606
01:07:57,580 --> 01:07:59,580
opium, relatable, and writing himself

1607
01:07:59,580 --> 01:08:01,580
prescriptions for sleeping pills using

1608
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:03,580
the name Dr. Nietzsche.

1609
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,580
Dr. Nietzsche? Pretty sure I got a Xanax

1610
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:07,580
prescription from that guy once.

1611
01:08:07,580 --> 01:08:09,580
Behind a Dairy Queen.

1612
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:11,580
Nietzsche was also a failed musician and

1613
01:08:11,580 --> 01:08:13,580
was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's

1614
01:08:13,580 --> 01:08:15,580
wife.

1615
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:17,580
The Virgin Nietzsche contra the

1616
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,580
Chad Wagner. You beta cuck.

1617
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:21,580
Why did I do that?

1618
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,580
Can we all agree that Catgirl Nietzsche

1619
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,580
is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?

1620
01:08:25,580 --> 01:08:27,580
I just want to mom this guy, honestly.

1621
01:08:27,580 --> 01:08:29,580
I don't even care that he's a misogynist.

1622
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:31,580
His misogyny is simply

1623
01:08:31,580 --> 01:08:33,580
too sad to be offended by. You know, I think

1624
01:08:33,580 --> 01:08:35,580
it's interesting that a person this

1625
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:37,580
pathetic can also be a genius

1626
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:39,580
whose name will never die. He's someone

1627
01:08:39,580 --> 01:08:41,580
who had a lot of reason to be envious

1628
01:08:41,580 --> 01:08:43,580
and self-pitying, but his philosophy

1629
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:45,580
couldn't be more against that.

1630
01:08:45,580 --> 01:08:47,580
And as a person of pathetic experience

1631
01:08:47,580 --> 01:08:49,580
myself, that is unironically kind

1632
01:08:49,580 --> 01:08:51,580
of inspiring to me. So let's

1633
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:53,580
go in. In his book on the

1634
01:08:53,580 --> 01:08:55,580
genealogy of morality, Frederick

1635
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,580
wants to explain the origin

1636
01:08:57,580 --> 01:08:59,580
of the concepts of good and evil.

1637
01:08:59,580 --> 01:09:01,580
Under what conditions did man invent

1638
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:03,580
the value judgments good and evil, and

1639
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:05,580
what value do they themselves have?

1640
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,580
Have they to now obstructed or

1641
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:09,580
promoted human flourishing? Hang on, my food's

1642
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,580
here. That's right, you're getting a mukbang,

1643
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:13,580
sweetie. Did you think I was gonna sit at this

1644
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,580
giant table and not be eating something?

1645
01:09:15,580 --> 01:09:17,580
This video's been going on more than an hour, so I assume

1646
01:09:17,580 --> 01:09:19,580
you guys are drunk by now, and we're just kind of

1647
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:21,580
hanging out at this point. You guys can't even

1648
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:23,580
see. Well, here. I've got

1649
01:09:23,580 --> 01:09:25,580
a bunch of sushi, and it's my mission to eat

1650
01:09:25,580 --> 01:09:27,580
all of this while summarizing the entire life

1651
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:29,580
and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.

1652
01:09:29,580 --> 01:09:31,580
Trisha Paytas, Nikocado, consider

1653
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:33,580
this a challenge. So Frederick argues

1654
01:09:33,580 --> 01:09:35,580
that good and bad, not

1655
01:09:35,580 --> 01:09:37,580
good and evil, that's different, we'll get to that,

1656
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:39,580
but good and bad were originally

1657
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:41,580
the self-affirming values

1658
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,580
of people with power.

1659
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:45,580
So to be good meant to be powerful,

1660
01:09:45,580 --> 01:09:47,580
strong, beautiful, healthy.

1661
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,580
And to be bad meant to be

1662
01:09:49,580 --> 01:09:51,580
weak, sick,

1663
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:53,580
common, ugly.

1664
01:09:53,580 --> 01:09:55,580
I'm gonna eat one like a cat.

1665
01:09:55,580 --> 01:09:57,580
And Frederick supports this speculation

1666
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,580
with etymology. So in a lot

1667
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:01,580
of languages, the word that means morally

1668
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:03,580
good or spiritually noble

1669
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:05,580
originally meant noble in the sense

1670
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:07,580
of aristocratic, the propertied

1671
01:10:07,580 --> 01:10:09,580
class. Like in Buddhism,

1672
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,580
the Arya Satyani, that's

1673
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,580
Sanskrit for noble truths.

1674
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:15,580
Arya means noble.

1675
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,580
And Arya is used to mean spiritually

1676
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,580
noble, but earlier it meant

1677
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:21,580
the aristocracy, the rich.

1678
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:23,580
And originally, it was just the name that a culture

1679
01:10:23,580 --> 01:10:25,580
in northern India gave themselves,

1680
01:10:25,580 --> 01:10:27,580
the Aryans. I'm really

1681
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:29,580
working not to get soy sauce on this list.

1682
01:10:29,580 --> 01:10:31,580
This was later misunderstood by Europeans

1683
01:10:31,580 --> 01:10:33,580
who wrongly thought

1684
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,580
that Aryan was a race.

1685
01:10:35,580 --> 01:10:37,580
Oops.

1686
01:10:37,580 --> 01:10:39,580
Goddammit.

1687
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:41,580
Goddammit, kids. Can we not?

1688
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,580
Frederick traces the origin of the

1689
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,580
German word gut, or the English

1690
01:10:45,580 --> 01:10:47,580
good, to the name of the Goths.

1691
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,580
No, not those Goths.

1692
01:10:49,580 --> 01:10:51,580
The Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.

1693
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:53,580
Frederick calls them the blonde

1694
01:10:53,580 --> 01:10:55,580
beasts of prey. I like to

1695
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:57,580
stalk my prey in the small hours

1696
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,580
of the night.

1697
01:10:59,580 --> 01:11:01,580
The German word schlecht, which means

1698
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:03,580
bad, is related to schlicht, which

1699
01:11:03,580 --> 01:11:05,580
means plain, simple, originally

1700
01:11:05,580 --> 01:11:07,580
common, low, not

1701
01:11:07,580 --> 01:11:09,580
aristocratic, not noble.

1702
01:11:09,580 --> 01:11:11,580
So good and bad

1703
01:11:11,580 --> 01:11:13,580
were originally the values of warrior

1704
01:11:13,580 --> 01:11:15,580
aristocrats who were like Homeric

1705
01:11:15,580 --> 01:11:17,580
heroes celebrating themselves.

1706
01:11:17,580 --> 01:11:19,580
And Frederick calls their value

1707
01:11:19,580 --> 01:11:21,580
system master morality.

1708
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,580
This glorification of combat,

1709
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,580
feasting, athleticism,

1710
01:11:25,580 --> 01:11:27,580
sexual conquest,

1711
01:11:27,580 --> 01:11:29,580
beauty. These things

1712
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:31,580
were called good. And their

1713
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:33,580
opposites, weakness, impotence,

1714
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,580
ugliness, were called bad.

1715
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,580
The ancient nobles worshipped

1716
01:11:37,580 --> 01:11:39,580
noble gods who acted like them

1717
01:11:39,580 --> 01:11:41,580
and shared their values. I mean, if I created

1718
01:11:41,580 --> 01:11:43,580
a personal goddess, I think we all know

1719
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:45,580
what animal that would be. Me and the ancient

1720
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:47,580
Egyptians on the same page. So for

1721
01:11:47,580 --> 01:11:49,580
example, Roman warriors could

1722
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:51,580
worship Mars, the god of war.

1723
01:11:51,580 --> 01:11:53,580
And it was like they were worshipping themselves.

1724
01:11:53,580 --> 01:11:55,580
They were dumb jocks, worshipping

1725
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,580
dumb jock gods. Well, good for them.

1726
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,580
But what about the people who got shoved

1727
01:11:59,580 --> 01:12:01,580
into lockers? Well,

1728
01:12:01,580 --> 01:12:03,580
Frederick's example, and this is gonna

1729
01:12:03,580 --> 01:12:05,580
create some misunderstandings later,

1730
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,580
but his example is

1731
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,580
the Jews who were colonized

1732
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:11,580
by the Romans in Judea.

1733
01:12:11,580 --> 01:12:13,580
And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try

1734
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,580
to revolt. Oh, they did.

1735
01:12:15,580 --> 01:12:17,580
Multiple times.

1736
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,580
But for several centuries, the Romans were

1737
01:12:19,580 --> 01:12:21,580
just too powerful. No one could stop

1738
01:12:21,580 --> 01:12:23,580
them. So the question is, what

1739
01:12:23,580 --> 01:12:25,580
happens psychologically to people

1740
01:12:25,580 --> 01:12:27,580
who are oppressed and who lack the

1741
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,580
power to overthrow the oppressor?

1742
01:12:29,580 --> 01:12:31,580
Well, in that case,

1743
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:33,580
frustrated vindictiveness builds over

1744
01:12:33,580 --> 01:12:35,580
time to become this deep

1745
01:12:35,580 --> 01:12:37,580
bitterness which Nietzsche gave the French

1746
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,580
name, Résentiment.

1747
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,580
Resentment in English.

1748
01:12:45,580 --> 01:12:47,580
I don't speak French. I just enjoy

1749
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,580
making vaguely French noises.

1750
01:12:53,580 --> 01:12:55,580
I don't like the English, but I like the French even less.

1751
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,580
Because they're always dressed so well, and they speak a sexier language

1752
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:59,580
than me. Stop it! This is your final

1753
01:12:59,580 --> 01:13:01,580
warning, comprendez-vous? Good wine, though.

1754
01:13:01,580 --> 01:13:03,580
I'll give them that. So there's a German word,

1755
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:05,580
Neid, which means envy.

1756
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,580
So why is Frederick using this

1757
01:13:07,580 --> 01:13:09,580
French term, Résentiment?

1758
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:11,580
What's going on, Frederick? Why are you speaking

1759
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,580
French? Are you nervous?

1760
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:15,580
You trying to impress me? Nietzsche must

1761
01:13:15,580 --> 01:13:17,580
have said Résentiment because he thought

1762
01:13:17,580 --> 01:13:19,580
it was something different than envy.

1763
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,580
I think the difference is resentment,

1764
01:13:21,580 --> 01:13:23,580
and I'm just gonna use the English word so I don't sound like an

1765
01:13:23,580 --> 01:13:25,580
asshole. Resentment is born

1766
01:13:25,580 --> 01:13:27,580
not just of wanting what someone

1767
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:29,580
has, but of a permanent frustration

1768
01:13:29,580 --> 01:13:31,580
of the desire for resentment.

1769
01:13:31,580 --> 01:13:33,580
Revenge. It's born of weakness,

1770
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:35,580
inability to get revenge.

1771
01:13:35,580 --> 01:13:37,580
Now revenge itself

1772
01:13:37,580 --> 01:13:39,580
implies weakness, at least a

1773
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,580
temporary weakness. We say revenge

1774
01:13:41,580 --> 01:13:43,580
is best served cold,

1775
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:45,580
but actually, revenge is only

1776
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:47,580
served cold.

1777
01:13:47,580 --> 01:13:49,580
If it's served hot, if someone slaps

1778
01:13:49,580 --> 01:13:51,580
you and you slap them back immediately,

1779
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:53,580
that's retaliation, not revenge.

1780
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:55,580
You brought

1781
01:13:55,580 --> 01:13:57,580
this on yourself. Revenge is only

1782
01:13:57,580 --> 01:13:59,580
a possibility when you can't

1783
01:13:59,580 --> 01:14:01,580
retaliate immediately. So you become

1784
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,580
vindictive. You start plotting and

1785
01:14:03,580 --> 01:14:05,580
scheming. But if you're too weak,

1786
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:07,580
too impotent to have any

1787
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:09,580
hope of revenge, then you become

1788
01:14:09,580 --> 01:14:11,580
resentful. So Nietzsche's argument is

1789
01:14:11,580 --> 01:14:13,580
that a person who's too weak to get material

1790
01:14:13,580 --> 01:14:15,580
revenge can instead

1791
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:17,580
get psychological revenge

1792
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:19,580
by creating a new morality.

1793
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,580
In Frederick's words,

1794
01:14:21,580 --> 01:14:23,580
the beginning of the slave's revolt

1795
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:25,580
in morality occurs when

1796
01:14:25,580 --> 01:14:27,580
Résentiment itself turns creative

1797
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:29,580
and gives birth to values.

1798
01:14:29,580 --> 01:14:31,580
This is a little high concept for a mukbang,

1799
01:14:31,580 --> 01:14:33,580
isn't it? What are you doing, Frederick?

1800
01:14:33,580 --> 01:14:35,580
So while master morality says that good

1801
01:14:35,580 --> 01:14:37,580
is power, riches, health, and

1802
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:39,580
strength, and bad is the

1803
01:14:39,580 --> 01:14:41,580
opposite, slave morality,

1804
01:14:41,580 --> 01:14:43,580
the morality of resentment, says

1805
01:14:43,580 --> 01:14:45,580
blessed are the poor, the

1806
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:47,580
meek, the sick, the powerless.

1807
01:14:47,580 --> 01:14:49,580
This is the good

1808
01:14:49,580 --> 01:14:51,580
of slave morality, and its opposite

1809
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:53,580
is not the bad, but a new concept,

1810
01:14:53,580 --> 01:14:55,580
the evil. And what

1811
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:57,580
is evil? Well, everything

1812
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,580
that master morality says is good.

1813
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:01,580
Power. Wealth.

1814
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:03,580
Conquest. Sexual

1815
01:15:03,580 --> 01:15:05,580
satisfaction.

1816
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,580
He's talking about

1817
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,580
Christianity here, he's not talking about

1818
01:15:13,580 --> 01:15:15,580
Judaism. But Frederick thinks of

1819
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:17,580
Christianity as the spiritual revenge

1820
01:15:17,580 --> 01:15:19,580
of the Jews against the Romans,

1821
01:15:19,580 --> 01:15:21,580
an inversion of the empire's

1822
01:15:21,580 --> 01:15:23,580
values. But he also thinks

1823
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:25,580
that slave morality is fundamentally

1824
01:15:25,580 --> 01:15:27,580
dishonest. It's like the fox

1825
01:15:27,580 --> 01:15:29,580
and the grapes. Not being

1826
01:15:29,580 --> 01:15:31,580
able to take revenge is called

1827
01:15:31,580 --> 01:15:33,580
not wanting to take revenge.

1828
01:15:33,580 --> 01:15:35,580
It might even be called

1829
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:37,580
forgiveness. Slave morality

1830
01:15:37,580 --> 01:15:39,580
says that weakness is

1831
01:15:39,580 --> 01:15:41,580
righteous. Submission to people you

1832
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:43,580
hate is called obedience.

1833
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:45,580
Having to wait is

1834
01:15:45,580 --> 01:15:47,580
called patience.

1835
01:15:47,580 --> 01:15:49,580
Inability to satisfy sexual desire

1836
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:51,580
is called chastity,

1837
01:15:51,580 --> 01:15:53,580
purity, and so on. And while

1838
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:55,580
master morality is born of saying

1839
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:57,580
yes to yourself, as a powerful,

1840
01:15:57,580 --> 01:15:59,580
noble beast

1841
01:15:59,580 --> 01:16:01,580
of prey, slave morality

1842
01:16:01,580 --> 01:16:03,580
is born of saying no

1843
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:05,580
to the master and everything he has

1844
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,580
that you can't. I like to have

1845
01:16:07,580 --> 01:16:09,580
my belly rubbed. Scratch my

1846
01:16:09,580 --> 01:16:11,580
back above my tail, please.

1847
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,580
I'm gonna put the rest of the fish away because it's getting warm

1848
01:16:13,580 --> 01:16:15,580
and I'm full. This has not been a successful

1849
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,580
mukbang. It turns out that it's actually very difficult

1850
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,580
to do a mukbang while

1851
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:21,580
talking. I should have thought this through a little harder.

1852
01:16:21,580 --> 01:16:23,580
So slave morality is born of a repressed

1853
01:16:23,580 --> 01:16:25,580
desire for revenge, but that desire

1854
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,580
for revenge never completely disappears.

1855
01:16:27,580 --> 01:16:29,580
It's there, for example, in the Christian

1856
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,580
idea of the Last Judgment.

1857
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,580
No need to take revenge

1858
01:16:33,580 --> 01:16:35,580
against the wicked, my sheep. God

1859
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:37,580
will do that for us. And in the meantime,

1860
01:16:37,580 --> 01:16:39,580
being weak

1861
01:16:39,580 --> 01:16:41,580
is good, actually.

1862
01:16:41,580 --> 01:16:43,580
I find this book thrilling

1863
01:16:43,580 --> 01:16:45,580
to read, honestly. And I'm not

1864
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:47,580
easily thrilled. Especially not

1865
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:49,580
by philosophers. I think this book in particular

1866
01:16:49,580 --> 01:16:51,580
gets me because, especially

1867
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:53,580
if you were raised Christian, this is

1868
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,580
so the opposite of everything

1869
01:16:55,580 --> 01:16:57,580
you were ever taught to believe that it almost feels

1870
01:16:57,580 --> 01:16:59,580
like, dirty.

1871
01:16:59,580 --> 01:17:01,580
Should I be reading this? Is this allowed?

1872
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:03,580
Because even if you're not religious,

1873
01:17:03,580 --> 01:17:05,580
most of us still agree with a lot of

1874
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:07,580
Christian morality. Like, yeah, Jesus

1875
01:17:07,580 --> 01:17:09,580
was a good guy. Blessed

1876
01:17:09,580 --> 01:17:11,580
are the meek. Sure. But then

1877
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:13,580
Frederick comes along and he's like,

1878
01:17:13,580 --> 01:17:15,580
hmm, morality is just a cope

1879
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:17,580
for frustrated vindictiveness.

1880
01:17:17,580 --> 01:17:19,580
And you're like, I need to lie down.

1881
01:17:19,580 --> 01:17:21,580
Where's my smelling salts?

1882
01:17:31,580 --> 01:17:33,580
But wait, there's more.

1883
01:17:33,580 --> 01:17:35,580
This gets even darker. Nietzsche

1884
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:37,580
thinks that over the last two millennia of European

1885
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:39,580
history, slave morality has

1886
01:17:39,580 --> 01:17:41,580
triumphed. Saint Paul made

1887
01:17:41,580 --> 01:17:43,580
Christianity marketable, the

1888
01:17:43,580 --> 01:17:45,580
Emperor Constantine converted,

1889
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,580
and by the Middle Ages, even

1890
01:17:47,580 --> 01:17:49,580
kings and aristocrats were kneeling down

1891
01:17:49,580 --> 01:17:51,580
not to powerful warrior gods

1892
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,580
made in their own image, but to

1893
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,580
a god that was weak.

1894
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,580
Suffering. Victimized.

1895
01:17:57,580 --> 01:17:59,580
Oppressed.

1896
01:17:59,580 --> 01:18:01,580
Mmm. So by the 19th

1897
01:18:01,580 --> 01:18:03,580
century, slave morality had become

1898
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,580
the only morality.

1899
01:18:05,580 --> 01:18:07,580
And it's not just Christianity, either.

1900
01:18:07,580 --> 01:18:09,580
The secular version of these values

1901
01:18:09,580 --> 01:18:11,580
became socialism, anarchism.

1902
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:13,580
About freethinkers and

1903
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:15,580
atheists, Nietzsche has this

1904
01:18:15,580 --> 01:18:17,580
to say.

1905
01:18:21,580 --> 01:18:23,580
Okay, the poison.

1906
01:18:23,580 --> 01:18:25,580
What is the poison?

1907
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:27,580
Well, Frederick thinks that resentment

1908
01:18:27,580 --> 01:18:29,580
poisons the mind,

1909
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:31,580
and turns humans against our own

1910
01:18:31,580 --> 01:18:33,580
natural instincts. Not just against

1911
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,580
aggression, but against sexuality,

1912
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,580
against ambition,

1913
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,580
against power, against life

1914
01:18:39,580 --> 01:18:41,580
itself. And there's two possible

1915
01:18:41,580 --> 01:18:43,580
outcomes of this. One is

1916
01:18:43,580 --> 01:18:45,580
that resentment becomes a political

1917
01:18:45,580 --> 01:18:47,580
movement. The conspiracy of those

1918
01:18:47,580 --> 01:18:49,580
who suffer. The tyranny of

1919
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,580
the herd. The revolution

1920
01:18:51,580 --> 01:18:53,580
that eats itself. Only we

1921
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:55,580
are good and just, is what they say.

1922
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,580
As though health, success, strength,

1923
01:18:57,580 --> 01:18:59,580
pride, and the feeling of power

1924
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:01,580
were in themselves depravities

1925
01:19:01,580 --> 01:19:03,580
for which penance, bitter penance

1926
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:05,580
will one day be exacted. Among them

1927
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:07,580
we find plenty of vengeance seekers

1928
01:19:07,580 --> 01:19:09,580
disguised as judges

1929
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:11,580
with the word justice continually in their mouth

1930
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:13,580
like poisonous spittle.

1931
01:19:13,580 --> 01:19:15,580
So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic

1932
01:19:15,580 --> 01:19:17,580
resentment mob. Which I'm sure

1933
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,580
we're all familiar with. The other outcome

1934
01:19:19,580 --> 01:19:21,580
is that this moralism turns

1935
01:19:21,580 --> 01:19:23,580
inward and attacks the individual

1936
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:25,580
conscience, producing

1937
01:19:25,580 --> 01:19:27,580
asceticism, self-denial,

1938
01:19:27,580 --> 01:19:29,580
guilt. Because slave morality

1939
01:19:29,580 --> 01:19:31,580
condemns not only the external

1940
01:19:31,580 --> 01:19:33,580
beasts of prey who are oppressing us

1941
01:19:33,580 --> 01:19:35,580
but also the beast

1942
01:19:35,580 --> 01:19:37,580
of prey within. Our own

1943
01:19:37,580 --> 01:19:39,580
animal instincts. What Christianity

1944
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,580
calls sin.

1945
01:19:41,580 --> 01:19:43,580
So Frederick thinks that modern humans

1946
01:19:43,580 --> 01:19:45,580
have become sick.

1947
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:47,580
We hate ourselves. We hate our

1948
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:49,580
own nature. We hate

1949
01:19:49,580 --> 01:19:51,580
life itself. I mean

1950
01:19:51,580 --> 01:19:53,580
is he wrong? You see a girl

1951
01:19:53,580 --> 01:19:55,580
boss winning. I only

1952
01:19:55,580 --> 01:19:57,580
see the will to power.

1953
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,580
Frederick thinks of modern men as

1954
01:19:59,580 --> 01:20:01,580
once proud wildcats who

1955
01:20:01,580 --> 01:20:03,580
become domesticated house pets

1956
01:20:03,580 --> 01:20:05,580
at the cost of everything

1957
01:20:05,580 --> 01:20:07,580
great in the human spirit.

1958
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,580
That's very valid

1959
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,580
Frederick.

1960
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:13,580
That's super hecking

1961
01:20:13,580 --> 01:20:15,580
valid. So look I've been

1962
01:20:15,580 --> 01:20:17,580
pretty positive about Nietzsche so far

1963
01:20:17,580 --> 01:20:19,580
but I do have a couple critiques I want to say.

1964
01:20:19,580 --> 01:20:21,580
One is that Frederick

1965
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:23,580
associating slave morality with

1966
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:25,580
the Jews is very irresponsible.

1967
01:20:25,580 --> 01:20:27,580
Even though he didn't intend to be

1968
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:29,580
anti-semitic and even though he was outspoken

1969
01:20:29,580 --> 01:20:31,580
against anti-semitism in his own time

1970
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:33,580
when you keep referring to the Christian

1971
01:20:33,580 --> 01:20:35,580
values you're critiquing as

1972
01:20:35,580 --> 01:20:37,580
Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge

1973
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,580
some people might get

1974
01:20:39,580 --> 01:20:41,580
the wrong idea. And some people did

1975
01:20:41,580 --> 01:20:43,580
Frederick. Like your dumbass sister

1976
01:20:43,580 --> 01:20:45,580
Elizabeth Nietzsche who became a literal

1977
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,580
alternative

1978
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,580
ethno-identitarian. God damn it

1979
01:20:49,580 --> 01:20:51,580
Liz. Kind of goth goals though.

1980
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:53,580
Yes that kind of goth. You're

1981
01:20:53,580 --> 01:20:55,580
right this time. My other critique is that

1982
01:20:55,580 --> 01:20:57,580
it doesn't seem to have occurred to Frederick

1983
01:20:57,580 --> 01:20:59,580
that genuinely caring about other people

1984
01:20:59,580 --> 01:21:01,580
is an option. Like not because

1985
01:21:01,580 --> 01:21:03,580
caring about other people is repressing your

1986
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,580
true selfish nature, but just because

1987
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,580
caring about other people is

1988
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,580
part of your nature. And isn't it?

1989
01:21:09,580 --> 01:21:11,580
Isn't caring about other people

1990
01:21:11,580 --> 01:21:13,580
also in our nature? I do think

1991
01:21:13,580 --> 01:21:15,580
most of what Nietzsche says about resentment

1992
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:17,580
accurately describes a

1993
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,580
very real thing. But it's not

1994
01:21:19,580 --> 01:21:21,580
the only thing. There is genuine

1995
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:23,580
care and love in this world

1996
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,580
I've been told. I've heard rumors.

1997
01:21:25,580 --> 01:21:27,580
And I'm even gonna go so far as to say

1998
01:21:27,580 --> 01:21:29,580
hashtag not all Christians. Christ

1999
01:21:29,580 --> 01:21:31,580
I'm defending the Christians. What does this channel

2000
01:21:31,580 --> 01:21:33,580
come to? There are Christians

2001
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:35,580
maybe not most, but still some

2002
01:21:35,580 --> 01:21:37,580
for whom love and forgiveness

2003
01:21:37,580 --> 01:21:39,580
are genuine experiences

2004
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:41,580
and not just some kind of

2005
01:21:41,580 --> 01:21:43,580
twisted impotent

2006
01:21:43,580 --> 01:21:45,580
passive aggressive vengeance.

2007
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:47,580
Where I agree with Nietzsche and with Freud

2008
01:21:47,580 --> 01:21:49,580
is I do think a lot of the

2009
01:21:49,580 --> 01:21:51,580
emotional foundation of justice

2010
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,580
and morality is

2011
01:21:53,580 --> 01:21:55,580
retribution, envy

2012
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:57,580
or some combination of the two.

2013
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,580
But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.

2014
01:21:59,580 --> 01:22:01,580
There's a famous Martin Luther King

2015
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:03,580
quote responding to Nietzsche

2016
01:22:03,580 --> 01:22:05,580
What is needed is a realization

2017
01:22:05,580 --> 01:22:07,580
that power

2018
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:09,580
without love is reckless

2019
01:22:09,580 --> 01:22:11,580
and abusive and that love without power

2020
01:22:11,580 --> 01:22:13,580
is sentimental and anemic.

2021
01:22:13,580 --> 01:22:15,580
Power at its best

2022
01:22:15,580 --> 01:22:17,580
is love

2023
01:22:17,580 --> 01:22:19,580
implementing the demands of justice

2024
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,580
and justice at its

2025
01:22:21,580 --> 01:22:23,580
best is love correcting

2026
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:25,580
everything that stands

2027
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,580
against love.

2028
01:22:27,580 --> 01:22:29,580
So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche

2029
01:22:29,580 --> 01:22:31,580
that to simply call power

2030
01:22:31,580 --> 01:22:33,580
evil is a sickness

2031
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:35,580
anemic. But there still needs

2032
01:22:35,580 --> 01:22:37,580
to be some kind of emotional or spiritual

2033
01:22:37,580 --> 01:22:39,580
force that keeps humanity

2034
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,580
from tearing itself apart. And maybe

2035
01:22:41,580 --> 01:22:43,580
something like this Christian idea

2036
01:22:43,580 --> 01:22:45,580
of love for humanity is the missing

2037
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:47,580
piece. Because without something like that

2038
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:49,580
I just see retribution

2039
01:22:49,580 --> 01:22:51,580
and envy snowballing

2040
01:22:51,580 --> 01:22:53,580
into human self destruction.

2041
01:22:53,580 --> 01:22:55,580
And I hate that for us. It's not very

2042
01:22:55,580 --> 01:22:57,580
sliving of us. Do you guys know about sliving?

2043
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,580
Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's

2044
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:01,580
YouTube channel? She doesn't have as many subscribers

2045
01:23:01,580 --> 01:23:03,580
as I do but you know. I try to support

2046
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,580
smaller creators.

2047
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,580
Sliving is basically slaying and living

2048
01:23:07,580 --> 01:23:09,580
your best life into one word. It's the new

2049
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:11,580
that's hot. Maybe I'll do a video about

2050
01:23:11,580 --> 01:23:13,580
love when I'm in a better mood.

2051
01:23:13,580 --> 01:23:15,580
So for now, well

2052
01:23:15,580 --> 01:23:17,580
let's put it this way. God is

2053
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:19,580
dead and we have killed

2054
01:23:19,580 --> 01:23:21,580
him, yeah?

2055
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:23,580
It's living.

2056
01:23:31,580 --> 01:23:33,580
So let us give him

2057
01:23:33,580 --> 01:23:35,580
all we see.

2058
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:41,580
Okay. I'm moisturized. I'm primed.

2059
01:23:41,580 --> 01:23:43,580
I've proven my academic credentials.

2060
01:23:43,580 --> 01:23:45,580
Now it's time to do my makeup.

2061
01:23:45,580 --> 01:23:47,580
That's right children, I'm going full

2062
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:49,580
Bailey Sarian. I'm going full

2063
01:23:49,580 --> 01:23:51,580
suspish. So I guess I should

2064
01:23:51,580 --> 01:23:53,580
say something about the political implications

2065
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:55,580
of all this since, uh, I guess

2066
01:23:55,580 --> 01:23:57,580
this channel's about politics. Sometimes

2067
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:59,580
I have to read my own Wikipedia article

2068
01:23:59,580 --> 01:24:01,580
to remember what I'm doing with my life.

2069
01:24:01,580 --> 01:24:03,580
But this morality of resentment,

2070
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,580
of impotence, and permanently

2071
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:07,580
frustrated revenge, judges

2072
01:24:07,580 --> 01:24:09,580
that power

2073
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:11,580
is evil. I don't use foundation, I just

2074
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:13,580
use concealer. I know that's like not

2075
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:15,580
how you're supposed to do makeup, but I don't need to be good

2076
01:24:15,580 --> 01:24:17,580
at makeup, okay? I have a million subscribers on

2077
01:24:17,580 --> 01:24:19,580
YouTube. I don't need to be good.

2078
01:24:19,580 --> 01:24:21,580
There was a New York Times article about young

2079
01:24:21,580 --> 01:24:23,580
women's attitudes toward political ambition

2080
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:25,580
and one of the women who was interviewed said

2081
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,580
as a white woman, I know

2082
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:29,580
I have unearned privilege. So

2083
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:31,580
am I really the best person to be in leadership?

2084
01:24:31,580 --> 01:24:33,580
Uh, yes.

2085
01:24:33,580 --> 01:24:35,580
Yes you are. Because we need leaders

2086
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:37,580
like you who are capable of

2087
01:24:37,580 --> 01:24:39,580
questioning the legitimacy of their own

2088
01:24:39,580 --> 01:24:41,580
authority. Otherwise, we're

2089
01:24:41,580 --> 01:24:43,580
just going to be stuck with another blonde beast of

2090
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,580
prey. And of course it's good to be

2091
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:47,580
aware of your privilege, especially

2092
01:24:47,580 --> 01:24:49,580
as a leader, but let's not be so

2093
01:24:49,580 --> 01:24:51,580
self-effacing that we efface

2094
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:53,580
ourselves off the face of the earth.

2095
01:24:53,580 --> 01:24:55,580
This is the self-sabotage of

2096
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:57,580
resentment values. If you think

2097
01:24:57,580 --> 01:24:59,580
power is evil, then you've given

2098
01:24:59,580 --> 01:25:01,580
up on the ambition to acquire any

2099
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:03,580
power, which virtually guarantees

2100
01:25:03,580 --> 01:25:05,580
your political irrelevance, since

2101
01:25:05,580 --> 01:25:07,580
like MLK said, you have to at least

2102
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:09,580
have some power to implement

2103
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,580
the demands of justice. Remember

2104
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,580
what incels call taking the black

2105
01:25:13,580 --> 01:25:15,580
pill, this conviction that the reason

2106
01:25:15,580 --> 01:25:17,580
you don't have a girlfriend is just that you're

2107
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,580
genetically undesirable. There's

2108
01:25:19,580 --> 01:25:21,580
nothing you can do to change it, and

2109
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:23,580
I guess women are just too shallow

2110
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:25,580
to be attracted to all the amazing hatred

2111
01:25:25,580 --> 01:25:27,580
and spite that festers in your heart.

2112
01:25:27,580 --> 01:25:29,580
For a lot of black-pilled incels,

2113
01:25:29,580 --> 01:25:31,580
it seems like there's only one thing left in

2114
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:33,580
life that they enjoy, which is

2115
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:35,580
simply the pleasure of complaining.

2116
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,580
Of moaning in pain.

2117
01:25:37,580 --> 01:25:39,580
It reminds me of a comment from

2118
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,580
Dostoevsky's second most

2119
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:43,580
horrible protagonist.

2120
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:45,580
Even in toothache there is enjoyment.

2121
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,580
In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence

2122
01:25:47,580 --> 01:25:49,580
but moan. But they are not candid

2123
01:25:49,580 --> 01:25:51,580
moans, they are malignant moans.

2124
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:53,580
And the malignancy is the whole point.

2125
01:25:53,580 --> 01:25:55,580
The moan is a protest

2126
01:25:55,580 --> 01:25:57,580
against the meaninglessness of pain.

2127
01:25:57,580 --> 01:25:59,580
And part of the satisfaction of

2128
01:25:59,580 --> 01:26:01,580
moaning is inflicting your

2129
01:26:01,580 --> 01:26:03,580
pain on other people.

2130
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:05,580
This kind of malignant moaning,

2131
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,580
it's kind of the opposite of music.

2132
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:09,580
Because a lot of music, like blues,

2133
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,580
is benevolent moaning

2134
01:26:11,580 --> 01:26:13,580
that transforms pain into pleasure.

2135
01:26:13,580 --> 01:26:15,580
I mean, that's what blues is all about.

2136
01:26:15,580 --> 01:26:17,580
My woman don't love me no more, but I know her

2137
01:26:17,580 --> 01:26:19,580
sister will. You know, optimism.

2138
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:21,580
I think a lot of incel discourse

2139
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,580
is really just malignant moaning.

2140
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,580
Right, it's not an attempt to diagnose

2141
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:27,580
or solve any problem.

2142
01:26:27,580 --> 01:26:29,580
It's just a contagious expression of misery.

2143
01:26:29,580 --> 01:26:31,580
A moan of pain that

2144
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,580
masquerades as a political agenda.

2145
01:26:33,580 --> 01:26:35,580
Sexual Marxism, they call it.

2146
01:26:35,580 --> 01:26:37,580
The redistribution of sex.

2147
01:26:37,580 --> 01:26:39,580
State-mandated GFs.

2148
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:41,580
That's very valid.

2149
01:26:41,580 --> 01:26:43,580
Of course, they don't actually expect any of this

2150
01:26:43,580 --> 01:26:45,580
to happen. That's not

2151
01:26:45,580 --> 01:26:47,580
the point. So incels are kind of

2152
01:26:47,580 --> 01:26:49,580
a universal punching bag online.

2153
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:51,580
It's very easy to point and laugh

2154
01:26:51,580 --> 01:26:53,580
at them. But what's harder is to look

2155
01:26:53,580 --> 01:26:55,580
in the mirror and notice how these

2156
01:26:55,580 --> 01:26:57,580
exact same tendencies

2157
01:26:57,580 --> 01:26:59,580
are rampant in our own communities.

2158
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,580
So the incel black pill is just one

2159
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:03,580
instance of what I call an ideology

2160
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,580
of resentment. A discourse

2161
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:07,580
that outwardly appears like moral

2162
01:27:07,580 --> 01:27:09,580
or political critique, but which on examination

2163
01:27:09,580 --> 01:27:11,580
is mainly just a resentful

2164
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:13,580
moan. The goal of resentment

2165
01:27:13,580 --> 01:27:15,580
politics is not to improve

2166
01:27:15,580 --> 01:27:17,580
conditions. In fact, the

2167
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,580
resentful person is full of contempt

2168
01:27:19,580 --> 01:27:21,580
for any morally compromised

2169
01:27:21,580 --> 01:27:23,580
sellouts who are

2170
01:27:23,580 --> 01:27:25,580
attempting to enact plausible reforms.

2171
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:27,580
They don't want victory.

2172
01:27:27,580 --> 01:27:29,580
They don't want power. They want to endlessly

2173
01:27:29,580 --> 01:27:31,580
critique power.

2174
01:27:31,580 --> 01:27:33,580
Because for them, critique is

2175
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:35,580
an important psychological defense

2176
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:37,580
against feeling

2177
01:27:37,580 --> 01:27:39,580
impotent. Shaler described

2178
01:27:39,580 --> 01:27:41,580
it this way.

2179
01:27:49,580 --> 01:27:51,580
What am I going to do with my eyes?

2180
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,580
I think a pink kind of

2181
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,580
look. We've been doing a lot of pink looks.

2182
01:27:55,580 --> 01:27:57,580
I love that hay fever look.

2183
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,580
As a general rule, the more radical

2184
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,580
a political community claims to be,

2185
01:28:01,580 --> 01:28:03,580
the more likely it is

2186
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:05,580
to be a community of resentment.

2187
01:28:05,580 --> 01:28:07,580
Self-styled radicals will tell you,

2188
01:28:07,580 --> 01:28:09,580
superficial surface reforms do not

2189
01:28:09,580 --> 01:28:11,580
interest us. The problem must

2190
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:13,580
be critiqued at its root.

2191
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,580
And then the root turns out to be this universal

2192
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,580
all-encompassing evil, right?

2193
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,580
Society itself.

2194
01:28:19,580 --> 01:28:21,580
The system. The machine.

2195
01:28:21,580 --> 01:28:23,580
A resentment ideologue always

2196
01:28:23,580 --> 01:28:25,580
imagines himself to be engaged in a

2197
01:28:25,580 --> 01:28:27,580
kind of satanic revolt

2198
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:29,580
against an omnipotent,

2199
01:28:29,580 --> 01:28:31,580
omnipresent enemy. Okay,

2200
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:33,580
I need to do makeup for a second.

2201
01:28:33,580 --> 01:28:35,580
It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.

2202
01:28:35,580 --> 01:28:37,580
It's hard to talk while doing this. And nothing short of

2203
01:28:37,580 --> 01:28:39,580
total revolution counts as any sort of

2204
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,580
victory whatsoever. We have to dismantle

2205
01:28:41,580 --> 01:28:43,580
the entire system.

2206
01:28:43,580 --> 01:28:45,580
Burn it all down.

2207
01:28:45,580 --> 01:28:47,580
I guess it's pedestrian to point out that this is

2208
01:28:47,580 --> 01:28:49,580
the revolutionary utopian equivalent

2209
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:51,580
of Christians awaiting the last judgment.

2210
01:28:51,580 --> 01:28:53,580
Our kingdom is coming, comrades!

2211
01:28:53,580 --> 01:28:55,580
Often the appeal of utopian

2212
01:28:55,580 --> 01:28:57,580
ideology is similar to religion.

2213
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,580
It's not about healthcare,

2214
01:28:59,580 --> 01:29:01,580
higher wages,

2215
01:29:01,580 --> 01:29:03,580
relief from police violence.

2216
01:29:03,580 --> 01:29:05,580
Those are actual goals that could be

2217
01:29:05,580 --> 01:29:07,580
demanded, worked for, and achieved.

2218
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:09,580
Utopian ideology instead

2219
01:29:09,580 --> 01:29:11,580
promises relief from some

2220
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,580
general malaise.

2221
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:15,580
Alienation.

2222
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,580
And so ironically, it can have the same

2223
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:19,580
opiate effect that Marx ascribes

2224
01:29:19,580 --> 01:29:21,580
to religion. But release from

2225
01:29:21,580 --> 01:29:23,580
the general anguish of human existence

2226
01:29:23,580 --> 01:29:25,580
is not a political goal.

2227
01:29:25,580 --> 01:29:27,580
There's been many revolutions in the last

2228
01:29:27,580 --> 01:29:29,580
few centuries, and so far

2229
01:29:29,580 --> 01:29:31,580
zero utopias.

2230
01:29:31,580 --> 01:29:33,580
Resentment, envy,

2231
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:35,580
and hunger, for that matter,

2232
01:29:35,580 --> 01:29:37,580
are not satiated by the downfall

2233
01:29:37,580 --> 01:29:39,580
of the old regime. When the people

2234
01:29:39,580 --> 01:29:41,580
have no bread, they eat the rich.

2235
01:29:41,580 --> 01:29:43,580
And when the rich

2236
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:45,580
are gone, they eat

2237
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:47,580
each other. And because of the proximity

2238
01:29:47,580 --> 01:29:49,580
effect, envy may actually

2239
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:51,580
increase after the revolution.

2240
01:29:51,580 --> 01:29:53,580
You may actually be more envious of a

2241
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:55,580
favored comrade, a

2242
01:29:55,580 --> 01:29:57,580
successful citoyen, oui,

2243
01:29:57,580 --> 01:29:59,580
a kulak, than you ever were of the

2244
01:29:59,580 --> 01:30:01,580
aristocrats. So envy turns

2245
01:30:01,580 --> 01:30:03,580
paranoid and imaginative

2246
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:05,580
in revolutionary moments.

2247
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:07,580
It gets sublimated into morality,

2248
01:30:07,580 --> 01:30:09,580
and the accusations

2249
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:11,580
start flying. That citizen

2250
01:30:11,580 --> 01:30:13,580
is conspiring against the revolution.

2251
01:30:13,580 --> 01:30:15,580
That peasant is hoarding grain.

2252
01:30:15,580 --> 01:30:17,580
So the guillotine starts slicing

2253
01:30:17,580 --> 01:30:19,580
thousands of heads off, the gulags

2254
01:30:19,580 --> 01:30:21,580
fill up, or an authoritarian

2255
01:30:21,580 --> 01:30:23,580
strongman takes over just to

2256
01:30:23,580 --> 01:30:25,580
announce another revolution

2257
01:30:25,580 --> 01:30:27,580
two decades later. The things people will do

2258
01:30:27,580 --> 01:30:29,580
to stay relevant, honestly.

2259
01:30:29,580 --> 01:30:31,580
And for what? What long-term

2260
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:33,580
egalitarian utopia results?

2261
01:30:33,580 --> 01:30:35,580
Socialism with Chinese characteristics?

2262
01:30:37,580 --> 01:30:39,580
So look, I do understand

2263
01:30:39,580 --> 01:30:41,580
that sometimes you just have to

2264
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,580
do a revolution. And if I'd been there in

2265
01:30:43,580 --> 01:30:45,580
1789, I'm sure

2266
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:47,580
I'd be storming the Bastille myself.

2267
01:30:47,580 --> 01:30:49,580
But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.

2268
01:30:49,580 --> 01:30:51,580
Revolution is a bloody nightmare that

2269
01:30:51,580 --> 01:30:53,580
happens because society is collapsing

2270
01:30:53,580 --> 01:30:55,580
and people are desperate. At worst,

2271
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:57,580
revolution is nothing more than a

2272
01:30:57,580 --> 01:30:59,580
violent day of retribution. And at

2273
01:30:59,580 --> 01:31:01,580
best, it lays the groundwork for future

2274
01:31:01,580 --> 01:31:03,580
incremental progress. But it will never

2275
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:05,580
usher in utopia, nor is it the

2276
01:31:05,580 --> 01:31:07,580
antidote to a vague sense of unease, which

2277
01:31:07,580 --> 01:31:09,580
I'm sorry to report, is

2278
01:31:09,580 --> 01:31:11,580
simply the resting state of an unsedated

2279
01:31:11,580 --> 01:31:13,580
human mind. Now I'm not

2280
01:31:13,580 --> 01:31:15,580
saying, as some conservatives do,

2281
01:31:15,580 --> 01:31:17,580
that all leftist or all

2282
01:31:17,580 --> 01:31:19,580
egalitarian politics is born of

2283
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:21,580
envy. No. This is a

2284
01:31:21,580 --> 01:31:23,580
specific subtype. There are

2285
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,580
plenty of reasons, other than

2286
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:27,580
envy or fear of envy, to oppose

2287
01:31:27,580 --> 01:31:29,580
an economic distribution where

2288
01:31:29,580 --> 01:31:31,580
some people have billions of dollars

2289
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:33,580
while other people are dying because they can't afford

2290
01:31:33,580 --> 01:31:35,580
insulin. Objectively, that is

2291
01:31:35,580 --> 01:31:37,580
not an efficient use of resources to

2292
01:31:37,580 --> 01:31:39,580
promote human well-being. And personally,

2293
01:31:39,580 --> 01:31:41,580
I just don't want to live in a country

2294
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:43,580
where people are dying because they

2295
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:45,580
can't afford medicine. And I'm willing to pay

2296
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,580
however many taxes it takes

2297
01:31:47,580 --> 01:31:49,580
for that not to happen. So while I'm

2298
01:31:49,580 --> 01:31:51,580
putting down straw-man versions of my

2299
01:31:51,580 --> 01:31:53,580
argument, I'm also not

2300
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,580
saying, oh, let's just stop being

2301
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,580
envious. No. That's

2302
01:31:57,580 --> 01:31:59,580
impossible. I think envy is like libido.

2303
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:01,580
It's a basic force of human

2304
01:32:01,580 --> 01:32:03,580
nature that's more or less

2305
01:32:03,580 --> 01:32:05,580
unstoppable. But with the right leadership,

2306
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,580
I think that envy can

2307
01:32:07,580 --> 01:32:09,580
potentially be sublimated

2308
01:32:09,580 --> 01:32:11,580
or redirected into something

2309
01:32:11,580 --> 01:32:13,580
more constructive. Because raw

2310
01:32:13,580 --> 01:32:15,580
envy is a very bad

2311
01:32:15,580 --> 01:32:17,580
basis for egalitarian politics.

2312
01:32:17,580 --> 01:32:19,580
It often targets the wrong people,

2313
01:32:19,580 --> 01:32:21,580
like millionaires instead of billionaires.

2314
01:32:21,580 --> 01:32:23,580
And eventually, it turns the revolution against

2315
01:32:23,580 --> 01:32:25,580
itself. And you get the circular firing

2316
01:32:25,580 --> 01:32:27,580
squad. The self-cannibalism.

2317
01:32:27,580 --> 01:32:29,580
The problem I see on the left today

2318
01:32:29,580 --> 01:32:31,580
is that without any genuine political

2319
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:33,580
outlet, resentment mostly manifests

2320
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,580
as morality. Morality

2321
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,580
itself being a way to

2322
01:32:37,580 --> 01:32:39,580
vent envious aggression and vindictiveness.

2323
01:32:39,580 --> 01:32:41,580
On the left, we claim to be so

2324
01:32:41,580 --> 01:32:43,580
impersonal, right? We're all about structural

2325
01:32:43,580 --> 01:32:45,580
analysis. The material

2326
01:32:45,580 --> 01:32:47,580
conditions. Systems of

2327
01:32:47,580 --> 01:32:49,580
power. Intersectional identity

2328
01:32:49,580 --> 01:32:51,580
hierarchies. But if you look at what people

2329
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:53,580
actually spend their time doing here,

2330
01:32:53,580 --> 01:32:55,580
it's all this obsessive moral

2331
01:32:55,580 --> 01:32:57,580
policing. I wonder if because

2332
01:32:57,580 --> 01:32:59,580
leftists can't seem to win on any

2333
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,580
major political stage, we feel

2334
01:33:01,580 --> 01:33:03,580
disempowered. And so this moral

2335
01:33:03,580 --> 01:33:05,580
fanaticism is a

2336
01:33:05,580 --> 01:33:07,580
psychological substitute. Like with Marie

2337
01:33:07,580 --> 01:33:09,580
Antoinette, it's easier to blame

2338
01:33:09,580 --> 01:33:11,580
people than systems. Also,

2339
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:13,580
structural analysis is

2340
01:33:13,580 --> 01:33:15,580
very boring, and destroying people

2341
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:17,580
with gossip is extremely entertaining.

2342
01:33:17,580 --> 01:33:19,580
This obsessive

2343
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,580
moral policing also gets

2344
01:33:21,580 --> 01:33:23,580
turned inward and becomes leftist

2345
01:33:23,580 --> 01:33:25,580
guilt. You know, this useless

2346
01:33:25,580 --> 01:33:27,580
internalized scolding.

2347
01:33:27,580 --> 01:33:29,580
I think I'm done with my makeup. What do we

2348
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:31,580
think? Leave a comment. I'm always hesitant

2349
01:33:31,580 --> 01:33:33,580
to do anything about skincare, since last time

2350
01:33:33,580 --> 01:33:35,580
I did skincare, I was critiqued by Hyram.

2351
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:37,580
So I am gonna spray my face a couple

2352
01:33:37,580 --> 01:33:39,580
times with this Tatcha skin

2353
01:33:39,580 --> 01:33:41,580
mist, if that's okay with Hyram.

2354
01:33:41,580 --> 01:33:43,580
It feels good to finally address this

2355
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:45,580
feud. Clear the air.

2356
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:47,580
I look a lot better with makeup.

2357
01:33:47,580 --> 01:33:49,580
I don't want to say that I don't have natural beauty,

2358
01:33:49,580 --> 01:33:51,580
it's just that it's very much enhanced by

2359
01:33:51,580 --> 01:33:53,580
painting a different face on top of

2360
01:33:53,580 --> 01:33:55,580
my face. But hey, at least this way

2361
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:57,580
I've kind of earned it, you know?

2362
01:33:57,580 --> 01:33:59,580
Because it's my skill. So there's a podcast

2363
01:33:59,580 --> 01:34:01,580
called Guilty Feminist that's been

2364
01:34:01,580 --> 01:34:03,580
running for years. And I haven't listened in a

2365
01:34:03,580 --> 01:34:05,580
while, but in the early episodes, they'd bring

2366
01:34:05,580 --> 01:34:07,580
on these women who would confess their

2367
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:09,580
feminist sins. You know,

2368
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:11,580
hi, my name is Amber,

2369
01:34:11,580 --> 01:34:13,580
I'm a feminist, but

2370
01:34:13,580 --> 01:34:15,580
I enjoy being choked

2371
01:34:15,580 --> 01:34:17,580
in bed. It's

2372
01:34:17,580 --> 01:34:19,580
hard being a woman. Not only are you being

2373
01:34:19,580 --> 01:34:21,580
choked, you also feel guilty

2374
01:34:21,580 --> 01:34:23,580
about it. The same moral hand-wringing

2375
01:34:23,580 --> 01:34:25,580
happens with body positivity.

2376
01:34:25,580 --> 01:34:27,580
When you make loving your body into

2377
01:34:27,580 --> 01:34:29,580
a moral imperative, not

2378
01:34:29,580 --> 01:34:31,580
only are you still going to hate your body,

2379
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:33,580
but now you're also going to feel guilty

2380
01:34:33,580 --> 01:34:35,580
about hating your body because it makes you a

2381
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,580
bad feminist. So there was one problem,

2382
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:39,580
and now there's two problems.

2383
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:41,580
Thanks, morality. That's very

2384
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:43,580
helpful. Now I want to take a moment to

2385
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:45,580
acknowledge that a lot of conservatives

2386
01:34:45,580 --> 01:34:47,580
have made some version of the

2387
01:34:47,580 --> 01:34:49,580
argument I'm making in this video.

2388
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,580
For example, Jordan Peterson

2389
01:34:51,580 --> 01:34:53,580
and Camille Paglia have argued

2390
01:34:53,580 --> 01:34:55,580
that academic postmodernists

2391
01:34:55,580 --> 01:34:57,580
are motivated by resentment. The argument

2392
01:34:57,580 --> 01:34:59,580
is that deconstructionist

2393
01:34:59,580 --> 01:35:01,580
literary theory is a kind of envious

2394
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:03,580
vengeance against the beauty

2395
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:05,580
and virtuosity of canonical

2396
01:35:05,580 --> 01:35:07,580
great art. And yeah, there's probably

2397
01:35:07,580 --> 01:35:09,580
some truth to that. A lot of academics

2398
01:35:09,580 --> 01:35:11,580
are field artists, but I was even more

2399
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:13,580
manqué than that. I've noticed that

2400
01:35:13,580 --> 01:35:15,580
working-class, non-academic socialists

2401
01:35:15,580 --> 01:35:17,580
do tend to be more

2402
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,580
productive and more self-advancing,

2403
01:35:19,580 --> 01:35:21,580
involved in unionizing or organizing.

2404
01:35:21,580 --> 01:35:23,580
Whereas, it's usually people who

2405
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:25,580
went to college. I went to

2406
01:35:25,580 --> 01:35:27,580
college!

2407
01:35:27,580 --> 01:35:29,580
Presumably because they had middle

2408
01:35:29,580 --> 01:35:31,580
class ambitions at some point,

2409
01:35:31,580 --> 01:35:33,580
but whose middle-class ambitions have

2410
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:35,580
failed. Who become the great

2411
01:35:35,580 --> 01:35:37,580
critiquers of capital. I mean, I can tell you

2412
01:35:37,580 --> 01:35:39,580
from experience that when I was eating

2413
01:35:39,580 --> 01:35:41,580
Chef Boyardee over my master's degree,

2414
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:43,580
that's when I was most likely to say things like

2415
01:35:43,580 --> 01:35:45,580
According to Antonio Gramsci,

2416
01:35:45,580 --> 01:35:47,580
in the logic of late-stage capitalism,

2417
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,580
the culturally hegemonic neoliberal

2418
01:35:49,580 --> 01:35:51,580
ideology manufactures the consent

2419
01:35:51,580 --> 01:35:53,580
of the civilian.

2420
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:55,580
Uh, so point taken. But some conservatives

2421
01:35:55,580 --> 01:35:57,580
take this argument way too

2422
01:35:57,580 --> 01:35:59,580
far and try to argue that the entire

2423
01:35:59,580 --> 01:36:01,580
left is nothing but a coalition

2424
01:36:01,580 --> 01:36:03,580
of resentment. Like there's a video on YouTube

2425
01:36:03,580 --> 01:36:05,580
of the philosophy professor Steven

2426
01:36:05,580 --> 01:36:07,580
Hicks doing a version of the

2427
01:36:07,580 --> 01:36:09,580
post-modernism is resentment argument,

2428
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:11,580
and in the comments section there's a bunch of people

2429
01:36:11,580 --> 01:36:13,580
saying, this describes Black

2430
01:36:13,580 --> 01:36:15,580
Lives Matter, Antifa, and

2431
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:17,580
the Democrats. Does

2432
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:19,580
it though? I mean, any political movement

2433
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:21,580
is gonna have people in it who suffer

2434
01:36:21,580 --> 01:36:23,580
from resentment poisoning. But Black Lives

2435
01:36:23,580 --> 01:36:25,580
Matter, at its core,

2436
01:36:25,580 --> 01:36:27,580
is about the right not to be murdered

2437
01:36:27,580 --> 01:36:29,580
by police. The slogan,

2438
01:36:29,580 --> 01:36:31,580
Black Lives Matter, is an affirmation

2439
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:33,580
of the value of Black life.

2440
01:36:33,580 --> 01:36:35,580
So, that seems like something even

2441
01:36:35,580 --> 01:36:37,580
Nietzsche would approve of. Huey Newton,

2442
01:36:37,580 --> 01:36:39,580
the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,

2443
01:36:39,580 --> 01:36:41,580
was inspired by Nietzsche to

2444
01:36:41,580 --> 01:36:43,580
create the slogan, All Power to the People.

2445
01:36:43,580 --> 01:36:45,580
When we coined the expression

2446
01:36:45,580 --> 01:36:47,580
All Power to the People, we had in mind

2447
01:36:47,580 --> 01:36:49,580
emphasizing the word power, for

2448
01:36:49,580 --> 01:36:51,580
we recognize that the will to power is

2449
01:36:51,580 --> 01:36:53,580
the basic drive of man. But it is

2450
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:55,580
incorrect to seek power over people.

2451
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:57,580
We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing

2452
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:59,580
power of exploitation and

2453
01:36:59,580 --> 01:37:01,580
racism for hundreds of years, and

2454
01:37:01,580 --> 01:37:03,580
the Black community has its will to power

2455
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:05,580
also. What we seek, however,

2456
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:07,580
is not power over people, but the

2457
01:37:07,580 --> 01:37:09,580
power of control of our own destiny.

2458
01:37:09,580 --> 01:37:11,580
That, to me, is a

2459
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:13,580
role model for how to do identity politics

2460
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:15,580
without centering resentment.

2461
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,580
It's instead an affirmation of

2462
01:37:17,580 --> 01:37:19,580
self-determination and self-respect.

2463
01:37:19,580 --> 01:37:21,580
Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying

2464
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:23,580
yes to yourself. Whereas, if your

2465
01:37:23,580 --> 01:37:25,580
whole political project is defined in the

2466
01:37:25,580 --> 01:37:27,580
negative, then you're allowing yourself

2467
01:37:27,580 --> 01:37:29,580
to be defined by your enemies. I find

2468
01:37:29,580 --> 01:37:31,580
feminism is prone to this, where even

2469
01:37:31,580 --> 01:37:33,580
and in fact especially the most radical

2470
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:35,580
feminists cannot seem to escape

2471
01:37:35,580 --> 01:37:37,580
this resentful consciousness of being

2472
01:37:37,580 --> 01:37:39,580
the second sex and defining themselves

2473
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:41,580
against men.

2474
01:37:41,580 --> 01:37:43,580
Earlier I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a

2475
01:37:43,580 --> 01:37:45,580
positive way. She's the most radical of

2476
01:37:45,580 --> 01:37:47,580
radical feminists, and my first

2477
01:37:47,580 --> 01:37:49,580
impulse is actually to defend her

2478
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:51,580
because she's very widely hated

2479
01:37:51,580 --> 01:37:53,580
and most of the people who hate her

2480
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,580
hate a caricature. Like in that Steven

2481
01:37:55,580 --> 01:37:57,580
Hicks video, Hicks summarizes

2482
01:37:57,580 --> 01:37:58,580
Dworkin as,

2483
01:37:59,580 --> 01:38:03,580
literally in the preface to her most

2484
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,580
famous book, Dworkin says,

2485
01:38:05,580 --> 01:38:07,580
If one's sexual experience

2486
01:38:07,580 --> 01:38:09,580
has always and without exception

2487
01:38:09,580 --> 01:38:11,580
been based on dominance,

2488
01:38:11,580 --> 01:38:13,580
how could one understand that this

2489
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:15,580
book does not say that all

2490
01:38:15,580 --> 01:38:17,580
men are rapists or that all intercourse

2491
01:38:17,580 --> 01:38:19,580
is rape? Listen Hicks,

2492
01:38:19,580 --> 01:38:21,580
I get that you're a full professor and I'm

2493
01:38:21,580 --> 01:38:23,580
just a makeup vlogger, but my gut

2494
01:38:23,580 --> 01:38:25,580
feeling on this one is, before

2495
01:38:25,580 --> 01:38:27,580
criticizing a book, maybe

2496
01:38:27,580 --> 01:38:29,580
read the book. Just a thought.

2497
01:38:29,580 --> 01:38:31,580
Get it together prof. You're being owned

2498
01:38:31,580 --> 01:38:33,580
online by a makeup vlogger. I mean

2499
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:35,580
there's no shame in that, it happens to me all the time.

2500
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,580
That being said, I do think that Hicks

2501
01:38:37,580 --> 01:38:39,580
is coincidentally correct

2502
01:38:39,580 --> 01:38:41,580
that Dworkin is a theorist

2503
01:38:41,580 --> 01:38:43,580
of resentment. What Dworkin does

2504
01:38:43,580 --> 01:38:45,580
say in this book is arguably

2505
01:38:45,580 --> 01:38:47,580
even more bleak than what is falsely

2506
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:49,580
attributed to her. The book is called

2507
01:38:49,580 --> 01:38:51,580
Intercourse. She wrote a book called Intercourse.

2508
01:38:51,580 --> 01:38:53,580
Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.

2509
01:38:53,580 --> 01:38:55,580
I can actually easily imagine that, never mind.

2510
01:38:55,580 --> 01:38:57,580
So this is an argument about the

2511
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,580
meaning of sex. Penetration

2512
01:38:59,580 --> 01:39:01,580
to be specific. Dworkin

2513
01:39:01,580 --> 01:39:03,580
argues that penetration expresses

2514
01:39:03,580 --> 01:39:05,580
domination, invasion,

2515
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:07,580
occupation, possession, contempt,

2516
01:39:07,580 --> 01:39:09,580
degradation. So it's

2517
01:39:09,580 --> 01:39:11,580
against the Freudian male

2518
01:39:11,580 --> 01:39:13,580
castration anxiety interpretation

2519
01:39:13,580 --> 01:39:15,580
where it's, you know, fear of

2520
01:39:15,580 --> 01:39:17,580
being devoured by the woman.

2521
01:39:17,580 --> 01:39:19,580
Imagine being afraid of that. Imagine

2522
01:39:19,580 --> 01:39:21,580
being afraid of that. I'm gonna get a

2523
01:39:21,580 --> 01:39:23,580
facelift someday, and I'm

2524
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:25,580
gonna look like this.

2525
01:39:25,580 --> 01:39:27,580
I'm perfect.

2526
01:39:27,580 --> 01:39:29,580
I certainly don't agree,

2527
01:39:29,580 --> 01:39:31,580
with everything she says, but isn't

2528
01:39:31,580 --> 01:39:33,580
Dworkin closer to the truth here? Closer than

2529
01:39:33,580 --> 01:39:35,580
Freud, anyway. You know, think about what men

2530
01:39:35,580 --> 01:39:37,580
typically say to women during

2531
01:39:37,580 --> 01:39:39,580
the act. Do they say,

2532
01:39:39,580 --> 01:39:41,580
Help, I'm being devoured.

2533
01:39:41,580 --> 01:39:43,580
Never heard that one. Have you?

2534
01:39:43,580 --> 01:39:45,580
No, usually it's more along the lines of

2535
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:47,580
You like that, don't you?

2536
01:39:47,580 --> 01:39:49,580
You little... Etc. And of course

2537
01:39:49,580 --> 01:39:51,580
you can eroticize being subjugated

2538
01:39:51,580 --> 01:39:53,580
and degraded, and enjoy it.

2539
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:55,580
And I think Dworkin would argue that most women

2540
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:57,580
do eroticize subjugation because

2541
01:39:57,580 --> 01:39:59,580
they're taught to. But enjoying it

2542
01:39:59,580 --> 01:40:01,580
she'd have to say, doesn't

2543
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,580
change the meaning of what's happening.

2544
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:05,580
So I think Dworkin says some things that are

2545
01:40:05,580 --> 01:40:07,580
very true, and some things that are off the fucking rails.

2546
01:40:07,580 --> 01:40:09,580
Where she loses me is where she

2547
01:40:09,580 --> 01:40:11,580
starts getting blackpilled, and this book,

2548
01:40:11,580 --> 01:40:13,580
this is the feminist blackpill.

2549
01:40:13,580 --> 01:40:15,580
It is 250 pages of

2550
01:40:15,580 --> 01:40:17,580
hopeless misery and rage. She

2551
01:40:17,580 --> 01:40:19,580
says, Male-dominant gender

2552
01:40:19,580 --> 01:40:21,580
hierarchy seems immune to

2553
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,580
reform. This may be because

2554
01:40:23,580 --> 01:40:25,580
intercourse itself is immune

2555
01:40:25,580 --> 01:40:27,580
to reform. Uh, okay, so

2556
01:40:27,580 --> 01:40:29,580
women will never be free, and

2557
01:40:29,580 --> 01:40:31,580
until men stop putting the P in the V.

2558
01:40:31,580 --> 01:40:33,580
We can dream, Andrea.

2559
01:40:33,580 --> 01:40:35,580
We can dream! Like

2560
01:40:35,580 --> 01:40:37,580
most ideology of resentment, this book

2561
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:39,580
is totally dismissive of any

2562
01:40:39,580 --> 01:40:41,580
plausible reforms that might

2563
01:40:41,580 --> 01:40:43,580
actually improve the situation of women.

2564
01:40:43,580 --> 01:40:45,580
Instead, preferring to wallow in the

2565
01:40:45,580 --> 01:40:47,580
endless violence, filth, and

2566
01:40:47,580 --> 01:40:49,580
objection of it all. I also think it's

2567
01:40:49,580 --> 01:40:51,580
symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a

2568
01:40:51,580 --> 01:40:53,580
lesbian, but in that second wave

2569
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:55,580
political way. Quoting from

2570
01:40:55,580 --> 01:40:57,580
the foreword, to Dworkin, it was a

2571
01:40:57,580 --> 01:40:59,580
badge of rebellion against the patriarch

2572
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:01,580
hierarchy. In 30 plus years of knowing

2573
01:41:01,580 --> 01:41:03,580
her, I've never heard of a single romance

2574
01:41:03,580 --> 01:41:05,580
with a woman not one. This is not

2575
01:41:05,580 --> 01:41:07,580
surprising to me from the author of a

2576
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:09,580
250 page book about sex

2577
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:11,580
that not once pauses to even

2578
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:13,580
imagine the possibility of

2579
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:15,580
intimacy between women. Because it's not a

2580
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:17,580
lesbianism that's about saying yes to

2581
01:41:17,580 --> 01:41:19,580
women. It's a lesbianism that's about

2582
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:21,580
saying no to men. You know, people

2583
01:41:21,580 --> 01:41:23,580
think that lesbians are the biggest man haters,

2584
01:41:23,580 --> 01:41:25,580
but I don't think that's true. I think

2585
01:41:25,580 --> 01:41:27,580
lesbians just don't think

2586
01:41:27,580 --> 01:41:29,580
about men that much. The only men I

2587
01:41:29,580 --> 01:41:31,580
think about are Fred Nietzsche and

2588
01:41:31,580 --> 01:41:33,580
Oedipus the King.

2589
01:41:33,580 --> 01:41:35,580
It's straight women who are usually the real

2590
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,580
man haters, because they're stuck with this.

2591
01:41:37,580 --> 01:41:39,580
And love is closer to hatred

2592
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,580
than neutrality. So what does Andrea Dworkin

2593
01:41:41,580 --> 01:41:43,580
actually want? What would she say

2594
01:41:43,580 --> 01:41:45,580
yes to, if she said yes to anything?

2595
01:41:45,580 --> 01:41:47,580
Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want,

2596
01:41:47,580 --> 01:41:49,580
because no one ever told them they could.

2597
01:41:49,580 --> 01:41:51,580
Romance. That's what Joan

2598
01:41:51,580 --> 01:41:53,580
Didion said is the real desire of the women's

2599
01:41:53,580 --> 01:41:55,580
movement. Joan Didion, of course, being

2600
01:41:55,580 --> 01:41:57,580
not like other girls. Dworkin offers occasional

2601
01:41:57,580 --> 01:41:59,580
glimpses of a positive desire.

2602
01:41:59,580 --> 01:42:01,580
Despite all efforts to socialize

2603
01:42:01,580 --> 01:42:03,580
women to one intercourse, women still

2604
01:42:03,580 --> 01:42:05,580
want a more diffuse and tender sensuality

2605
01:42:05,580 --> 01:42:07,580
that involves the whole body in a

2606
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:09,580
polymorphous tenderness. That does sound

2607
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:11,580
nice. I'm so lonely.

2608
01:42:11,580 --> 01:42:13,580
I think it's a bit bold to speak

2609
01:42:13,580 --> 01:42:15,580
for all women, though. Like, there are

2610
01:42:15,580 --> 01:42:17,580
definitely women out there who, uh,

2611
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:19,580
they don't make love. Anastasia,

2612
01:42:19,580 --> 01:42:21,580
they f***

2613
01:42:21,580 --> 01:42:23,580
hard. I'm really sleepy, and

2614
01:42:23,580 --> 01:42:25,580
this bed right behind me just looks

2615
01:42:25,580 --> 01:42:27,580
so nice. Get in here right now.

2616
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:29,580
What if I just go to sleep?

2617
01:42:29,580 --> 01:42:31,580
And then wake up, and then just record

2618
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:33,580
the rest of the video when I wake up. I don't want to do it

2619
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,580
now. I'll get Pikachu. That'll make this easier.

2620
01:42:35,580 --> 01:42:37,580
Isn't it better for me to have a friend?

2621
01:42:37,580 --> 01:42:39,580
Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.

2622
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:41,580
Why? Because he's the yellowest.

2623
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:43,580
Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.

2624
01:42:43,580 --> 01:42:45,580
You can't name anything. You can't think of anything.

2625
01:42:45,580 --> 01:42:47,580
So if diffuse and tender sensuality

2626
01:42:47,580 --> 01:42:49,580
is what you want, then just

2627
01:42:49,580 --> 01:42:51,580
say that. Is that what you want, Pikachu?

2628
01:42:51,580 --> 01:42:53,580
I bet it is.

2629
01:42:53,580 --> 01:42:55,580
And Dworkin did get married.

2630
01:42:55,580 --> 01:42:57,580
To a gay man. So I

2631
01:42:57,580 --> 01:42:59,580
guess she found what she wanted.

2632
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:01,580
Lucky.

2633
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:03,580
Envying

2634
01:43:03,580 --> 01:43:05,580
Andrea Dworkin. Is that really what we've

2635
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:07,580
sunk to around here? You know, I've been noticing

2636
01:43:07,580 --> 01:43:09,580
the poison creeping

2637
01:43:09,580 --> 01:43:11,580
into my mind lately. I know this isn't

2638
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:13,580
very original, but I had

2639
01:43:13,580 --> 01:43:15,580
a bad year. You know, I fell in love with my

2640
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:17,580
best friend like a gay idiot,

2641
01:43:17,580 --> 01:43:19,580
got my heart comprehensively

2642
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:21,580
broken, and then COVID hit

2643
01:43:21,580 --> 01:43:23,580
and gave me a year of solitude

2644
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:25,580
to spiral deeper

2645
01:43:25,580 --> 01:43:27,580
into a hell of my own making.

2646
01:43:27,580 --> 01:43:29,580
You know, I stopped saying yes to life.

2647
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,580
And I started saying yes to chasing

2648
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:33,580
the dragon. By which I mean

2649
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:35,580
playing Spyro the Dragon. One of the

2650
01:43:35,580 --> 01:43:37,580
greatest appropriate for all ages

2651
01:43:37,580 --> 01:43:39,580
video games of all time.

2652
01:43:39,580 --> 01:43:41,580
Look at him gooooooo

2653
01:43:41,580 --> 01:43:43,580
I'm taking the hair clips out. I catch

2654
01:43:43,580 --> 01:43:45,580
myself having bitter spinster thoughts.

2655
01:43:45,580 --> 01:43:47,580
It's because I'm trans.

2656
01:43:47,580 --> 01:43:49,580
It's because I'm gay. That's

2657
01:43:49,580 --> 01:43:51,580
why I'll die alone. Yeah, that's the reason

2658
01:43:51,580 --> 01:43:53,580
I'm alone. Definitely not because I don't

2659
01:43:53,580 --> 01:43:55,580
leave the house. See, I am not immune

2660
01:43:55,580 --> 01:43:57,580
to incel-tier

2661
01:43:57,580 --> 01:43:59,580
brain poisoning. And you really can't

2662
01:43:59,580 --> 01:44:01,580
use political theorizing as

2663
01:44:01,580 --> 01:44:03,580
an excuse not to fix your

2664
01:44:03,580 --> 01:44:05,580
life. Society did

2665
01:44:05,580 --> 01:44:07,580
this to me. A transphobic

2666
01:44:07,580 --> 01:44:09,580
society made me hate myself.

2667
01:44:09,580 --> 01:44:11,580
Well,

2668
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:13,580
yeah, that's true.

2669
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:15,580
But at a certain point, you have

2670
01:44:15,580 --> 01:44:17,580
to take responsibility for your own

2671
01:44:17,580 --> 01:44:19,580
mind, and decide to stop being

2672
01:44:19,580 --> 01:44:21,580
an accomplice in your own annihilation.

2673
01:44:21,580 --> 01:44:23,580
Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost,

2674
01:44:23,580 --> 01:44:25,580
the mind is its own place, and in

2675
01:44:25,580 --> 01:44:27,580
itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of

2676
01:44:27,580 --> 01:44:29,580
heaven. Yeah, squad. So I asked

2677
01:44:29,580 --> 01:44:31,580
myself, what kind of mind

2678
01:44:31,580 --> 01:44:33,580
do I want to be? Do I want to obsess

2679
01:44:33,580 --> 01:44:35,580
over what I lack? Concede

2680
01:44:35,580 --> 01:44:37,580
society's judgment of my inferiority?

2681
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:39,580
Become a self-hating, self-pitying,

2682
01:44:39,580 --> 01:44:41,580
envious, resentful little

2683
01:44:41,580 --> 01:44:43,580
nothing? Or, do I want

2684
01:44:43,580 --> 01:44:45,580
to get off the goddamn

2685
01:44:45,580 --> 01:44:47,580
floor, stop chasing the dragon,

2686
01:44:47,580 --> 01:44:49,580
and say yes to life?

2687
01:44:49,580 --> 01:44:51,580
The answer, of course, is that

2688
01:44:51,580 --> 01:44:53,580
I long to return to the sweet womb

2689
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:55,580
of my dark mother. But we're not gonna do

2690
01:44:55,580 --> 01:44:57,580
that, because there's plenty of time to numb

2691
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:59,580
the pain after you die. The sweet

2692
01:44:59,580 --> 01:45:01,580
embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.

2693
01:45:01,580 --> 01:45:03,580
Also, nothing is

2694
01:45:03,580 --> 01:45:05,580
less attractive than an

2695
01:45:05,580 --> 01:45:07,580
envious, resentful,

2696
01:45:07,580 --> 01:45:09,580
self-pitying person. It's beyond

2697
01:45:09,580 --> 01:45:11,580
a personality flaw. It's

2698
01:45:11,580 --> 01:45:13,580
a personality deformity

2699
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,580
that can ruin whatever chance at happiness

2700
01:45:15,580 --> 01:45:17,580
you have. So, in the short

2701
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:19,580
time that you're alive, you have to

2702
01:45:19,580 --> 01:45:21,580
discover that which is noble

2703
01:45:21,580 --> 01:45:23,580
in yourself, and say yes to it.

2704
01:45:23,580 --> 01:45:25,580
You know, don't say no to getting older.

2705
01:45:25,580 --> 01:45:27,580
Say yes to being a MILF.

2706
01:45:27,580 --> 01:45:29,580
Yes. Yes.

2707
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:31,580
What I'm really trying to say here is

2708
01:45:31,580 --> 01:45:33,580
Spongebob Squarepants is the

2709
01:45:33,580 --> 01:45:35,580
ubermensch. Spongebob says

2710
01:45:35,580 --> 01:45:37,580
yes to life, and so should we.

2711
01:45:37,580 --> 01:45:39,580
Yes to ourselves. Yes to

2712
01:45:39,580 --> 01:45:41,580
art. Yes to sensuality.

2713
01:45:41,580 --> 01:45:43,580
Yes to the world. Yes.

2714
01:45:43,580 --> 01:45:45,580
Yes.

2715
01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:47,580
We.

2716
01:45:47,580 --> 01:45:49,580
Is this really how we're ending the video?

2717
01:45:49,580 --> 01:45:51,580
I guess.

2718
01:45:51,580 --> 01:45:53,580
Okay, bye!

2719
01:45:59,580 --> 01:46:09,580
Oh, so what

2720
01:46:09,580 --> 01:46:11,580
if my fantasies make no sense? You wanna

2721
01:46:11,580 --> 01:46:13,580
talk about things that don't make sense?

2722
01:46:13,580 --> 01:46:15,580
Heterosexuality. Let's put that under the microscope,

2723
01:46:15,580 --> 01:46:17,580
hmm? You want me to believe

2724
01:46:17,580 --> 01:46:19,580
that a straight woman who knows

2725
01:46:19,580 --> 01:46:21,580
the difference between magenta and mauve

2726
01:46:21,580 --> 01:46:23,580
is gonna date a straight man

2727
01:46:23,580 --> 01:46:25,580
who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear,

2728
01:46:25,580 --> 01:46:27,580
and that's just gonna work out fine.

2729
01:46:27,580 --> 01:46:29,580
You think it's safe to raise a child in that

2730
01:46:29,580 --> 01:46:31,580
environment? I don't think so.

2731
01:46:31,580 --> 01:46:33,580
Not on my watch.

2732
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,580
See, I think straight men should date each other.

2733
01:46:35,580 --> 01:46:37,580
They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox

2734
01:46:37,580 --> 01:46:39,580
and then each other. And then straight women

2735
01:46:39,580 --> 01:46:41,580
can pair off, decoupage

2736
01:46:41,580 --> 01:46:43,580
some shit, and eat each other out.

2737
01:46:43,580 --> 01:46:45,580
Isn't that better? Isn't that more

2738
01:46:45,580 --> 01:46:47,580
rational? I wish I could wiggle these cat ears.

2739
01:46:47,580 --> 01:46:49,580
Like, I wish I had anatomical

2740
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:51,580
control over them. Hello?

2741
01:46:51,580 --> 01:46:53,580
Yes, Dr. Spiegel?

2742
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:55,580
Yes, it's me again.

2743
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:57,580
I have a suggestion. What do we even have here?

2744
01:46:57,580 --> 01:46:59,580
We've got tuna, salmon,

2745
01:46:59,580 --> 01:47:01,580
some squid,

2746
01:47:01,580 --> 01:47:03,580
mackerel, shrimp,

2747
01:47:03,580 --> 01:47:05,580
some, I think it's yellowtail,

2748
01:47:05,580 --> 01:47:07,580
clam,

2749
01:47:07,580 --> 01:47:09,580
some rolls. I've never been as much into rolls.

2750
01:47:09,580 --> 01:47:11,580
I'm a cat, you know, I like fish.

2751
01:47:11,580 --> 01:47:13,580
You start adding too much avocado and rice into things.

2752
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:15,580
It's an affront to my

2753
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:17,580
feline nature.

2754
01:47:29,580 --> 01:47:33,580
Yes, I'm sure.

2755
01:47:33,580 --> 01:47:35,580
To make sure it's not too much,

2756
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:37,580
get the phone ready,

2757
01:47:37,580 --> 01:47:39,580
you find a place where

2758
01:47:39,580 --> 01:47:42,640
you can actually

2759
01:47:42,640 --> 01:47:44,640
eat them.

2760
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:59,480
Give you some

2761
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:12,060
Thank you for watching!

2762
01:48:12,060 --> 01:48:15,760
Doctor, I think if a breeze comes into the window, I could die.
