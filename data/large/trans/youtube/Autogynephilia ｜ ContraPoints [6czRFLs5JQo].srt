00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:41,340
In 1989, a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically

3
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,520
incorrect theory claiming that trans women are not, as custom has it, essentially female

4
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,780
souls accidentally born into male bodies.

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,680
Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types, gay men who love straight men, and straight

6
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,020
men who love themselves.

7
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:59,720
For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term autogynephilia.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,580
New Greek for love of oneself as a woman.

9
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,980
It's a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves,

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,160
and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which,

11
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,840
okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard said.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,180
One, just what the hell do I think I'm doing?

13
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:40,740
Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard's theory is false, but

14
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:45,340
a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I'm using my platform to potentially

15
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:50,260
increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already

16
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:50,700
face.

17
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,940
After all, autogynephilia gives scientific legitimacy to our culture's most twisted

18
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,680
misrepresentations of trans women.

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,940
Who do you fuck with?

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,360
So it's understandable that to a lot of trans women, the prospect of this concept

21
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,060
gaining cultural traction is pretty terrifying.

22
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:13,200
However, I respond that, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transsexuals, I've had several

23
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,120
conversations with academics and journalists where it becomes clear that they believe in

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,480
Blanchard's theory, even if the cowards won't admit it to my face.

25
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:25,240
So as I see it, the damage is already done, what's needed now is an accessible, convincing

26
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,680
refutation of the theory.

27
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,940
I hope this video will accomplish three things.

28
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:29,940
1.

29
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,660
Persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong.

30
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,660
2.

31
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,660
Account for how a wrong theory became so influential.

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,660
3.

33
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,260
Move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people and open up a deeper discussion about

34
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,680
what it really means to be transgender.

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,020
Socrates?

36
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,020
You know the drill.

37
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,980
2.

38
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,440
Blanchard's Typology

39
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:54,620
The mainstream scientific view, endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:59,780
Health, the DSM-5, and most practicing clinicians, is that the primary reason trans people trans

41
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,800
transition is to alleviate gender dysphoria.

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,820
Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual, and sartorial

43
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:13,400
angst relating to one's assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and medically

44
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,600
transitioning to the gender of one's psychological identity.

45
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:20,820
This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view.

46
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,500
However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory.

47
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,240
He didn't really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all

49
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,420
are excused.

50
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,060
You can just grab a beer and laugh it up.

51
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,100
Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of men, and yeah, I know, just

52
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,740
hold your objections for the end.

53
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,320
The first type are the homosexual transsexuals.

54
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:51,120
These gay boys cannot get enough dick, and who can blame them?

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,020
Essentially, the homosexual transsexuals are naturally effeminate gay men who transition

56
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:57,020
because 1.

57
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
1.

58
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,500
They're more disgusting of them as women than as very effeminate men, and 2.

59
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,240
Becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them since they do better as women in the

60
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,140
heterosexual dating market than as male femmes in the mask-for-mask dominated gay scene.

61
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:14,000
The second type of trans women are the autogynephilic transsexuals.

62
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,300
These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror.

63
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:24,440
Blanchard describes autogynephiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men.

64
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,940
It doesn't really matter, because their primary sexual orientation is asexuality.

65
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,780
It's misdirected inward, leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming

66
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,180
women, which is their true motivation to transition.

67
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,960
Now I'm going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge

68
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:43,660
that there does seem to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend

69
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,620
to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits.

70
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:51,700
I'll replace the stigmatizing terms homosexual transsexual and autogynephile with more neutral

71
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:57,280
language, let's say cluster A and cluster B. Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic,

72
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,940
attracted to men.

73
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:03,040
They transition relatively early in life and are very effeminate as children.

74
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:07,400
Cluster B trans women are mostly gynephilic, attracted to women, transition relatively

75
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,820
later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods.

76
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,320
When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid.

77
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,440
I went through the mental list of trans women I know, and found I could pretty easily sort

78
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:19,440
them.

79
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,180
Cluster A, cluster A, cluster B, cluster B. But as I've thought about it more, it's

80
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,180
partially unraveled.

81
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,940
Without even leaving my circle of acquaintances, I can think of a trans woman who falls into

82
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,940
one of two clusters.

83
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,320
A trans woman who followed all the cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans

84
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,200
woman who followed all the cluster B patterns but now exclusively dates men.

85
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,000
So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here, I interpret them merely as correlation

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,260
clusters that get fuzzy around the edges.

87
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,300
Blanchard, however, takes homosexual transsexuals and autogynephiles to be two sharply distinct

88
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,760
types, with two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition.

89
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:56,620
And this is what I strongly disagree with, the notion that male homosexuals' strategy,

90
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,940
or autogynephilic lust, is the same.

91
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,760
Transsexuals are the primary motivations to transition, and I have a lot of backup

92
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,740
here since trans women almost universally reject this characterization of their experience.

93
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,620
Now you'd think that'd be a major problem for the theory, but fortunately Blanchard

94
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:15,820
has an airtight response to that, namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking

95
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,820
liars.

96
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,040
I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it?

97
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,500
A theory that can't be falsified.

98
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,500
It's perfect.

99
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,500
3.

100
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,700
The Man Who Would Be Queen

101
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,700
3.

102
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
The Man Who Would Be Queen

103
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,220
Blanchard's theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of sexologists before

104
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,680
fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications had it not been given

105
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,140
a major publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed

106
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,380
Blanchard's theory in a 2003 pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen.

107
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,840
Great cover, Bailey.

108
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,540
Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect.

109
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,940
I have been triggered.

110
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Well done.

111
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,580
Now Bailey, I read your book, which, considering how much I enjoy your cream, is a very controversial,

112
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
very provocative, very politically incorrect, I have been triggered.

113
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
Well done.

114
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,500
The Man Who Would Be Queen was just amazingly bad.

115
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,360
The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women because it's acutely

116
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,860
transphobic but also kind of vivid and well written, and it introduced a wide audience

117
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,400
to Blanchard's typology.

118
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,620
The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals, including Bailey's and his

119
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,540
male research assistant's observations that they're super fuckable and natural-born sex

120
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
workers.

121
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,380
I start upstairs to get the panoramic view and I see Kim for the first time on the stairs

122
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
dancing, posing.

123
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,380
She is spectacular.

124
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,380
She is spectacular.

125
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,700
She is spectacular.

126
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
Exotic.

127
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,700
I find out later that she is from Belize.

128
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,660
And sexy.

129
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:40,200
Her body is incredibly curvaceous, which is a clue that it may not be natural.

130
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:47,720
And I notice a very subtle and not unattractive angularity of the face, which is also not clearly

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,060
diagnostic on this tall siren.

132
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:56,140
It is difficult to avoid viewing Kim from two perspectives.

133
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,140
As a researcher.

134
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:02,140
But also as a single heterosexual man.

135
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,700
Wow Bailey, great science writing.

136
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:09,140
When he's done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals, Bailey moves on to the autogynephilic

137
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,140
transsexuals, focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls

138
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:19,140
Cher, whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of autoerotic mania and transvestic

139
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,140
masturbation.

140
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:25,140
Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prostheses,

141
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,140
while receiving anal sex from a sex worker.

142
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Bailey says she has been able to get her anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction,

143
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
all to the accompaniment of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film.

144
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,140
It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke.

145
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,140
So well done Bailey, you've found an honest-to-god pervert.

146
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot.

147
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
I admire it, I want it in my life.

148
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,140
But as a transsexual, I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.

149
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,140
You just found a person who built a sex robot.

150
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,140
That's not helpful.

151
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm sorry.

152
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,140
I'm sorry.

153
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,140
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:40,140
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:42,140
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,140
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,140
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,140
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,140
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,140
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:50,240
I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.

164
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,740
You just found a- You just found a person who built a sex robot!

165
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,560
That's not how Bailey sees it, though.

166
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:02,080
He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autogynephiliac transsexual, claiming that

167
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,600
Cher's sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women who aren't

168
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,420
exclusively attracted to men.

169
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:13,060
So Bailey's telling is that autogynephiles are these unfeminine male masturbators showing

170
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,080
up to gender clinics with bogus stories of how they always knew they

171
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,320
women in order to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia.

172
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,240
Now what's striking about this to me is even for a defense of Blanchard's theory,

173
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,440
Bailey's account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be.

174
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,280
Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher,

175
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,680
pursuing the light of truth wherever it may lead,

176
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,120
unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness alike.

177
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,960
You're so filthy.

178
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:41,840
But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like?

179
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,640
What objective methodologies does Bailey employ?

180
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,560
Well, for the most part, it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago

181
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,480
and chats up trans women, turning these stories into case studies for his book.

182
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,520
Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research.

183
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,360
You need a research assistant, Bailey?

184
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
The Man Who Would Be Queen is filled with sentences like,

185
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:07,760
There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer, so I'll just go ahead.

186
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,480
All right, you edgy fuck, let's hear it.

187
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,400
Most homosexual transsexuals are

188
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,640
most

189
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,960
much better looking than most autogynephilic transsexuals.

190
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,240
We appreciate the feedback, Bailey, we really do.

191
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,760
But is this science?

192
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,960
It's effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery

193
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,000
that young straight chicks are hotter than middle-aged lesbians

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,040
and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation.

195
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,560
And like the pop science cishet men have written over the past century

196
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
regarding the nature of females and homosexuals,

197
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,920
their observations about trans women are seriously lacking some vital perspectives.

198
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,400
This is what

199
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,960
we postmodernists mean when we complain that science often privileges a white,

200
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,640
cishet male perspective.

201
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
It's not that I hate men or male sexuality,

202
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,800
I just hate that the male sexual perspective is so powerful that it gets to call itself science.

203
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
It's not that there is no objective truth,

204
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,920
it's that this represents a very narrow window on it.

205
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,480
Wouldn't anyone care to hear a different perspective?

206
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,920
Well, how about mine?

207
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,360
Four.

208
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,560
My perspective.

209
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
From my perspective, Michael,

210
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,320
Bailey is a lecherous edgelord.

211
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,960
He's a man who, when I was a student at Northwestern,

212
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,760
was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident.

213
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,560
Google it.

214
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,080
Of course, that doesn't mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren't true.

215
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,360
Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard

216
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
to sacrifice a trans baby to Beelzebub,

217
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,840
it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctness of the theory,

218
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,280
which might still be true.

219
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,360
The problem is, it isn't true,

220
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,120
which I'll argue at length in a moment.

221
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,080
But first, it's worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance,

222
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,960
among a non-trivial number of academics and journalists.

223
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,400
Largely because, one,

224
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,840
it's often presented as the only supposedly scientific alternative

225
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,720
to mushy platitudes about women born in men's bodies,

226
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,440
and two,

227
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,080
many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard

228
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,400
with extreme vitriol and personal attacks,

229
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:04,160
resulting in the widespread perception that a bunch of triggered PC cucks

230
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,280
are throwing a narcissistic male-entitlement temper tantrum

231
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:11,360
because Bailey and Blanchard accurately call them out as paraphilic fetishists.

232
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,840
In her 2015 book, Galileo's Middle Finger,

233
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,440
bioethicist Alice Drager championed Bailey as the undeserving victim

234
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
of a hysterical SJW lynch mob.

235
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,080
But she gets so caught up in exonerating Bailey

236
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,000
of the personal accusations against him,

237
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,560
and in telling a bigger story about academic freedom

238
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,280
and how scientists are being silenced by PC cucks,

239
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,800
that she doesn't bother to check how good Bailey's science really is,

240
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,840
and ends up affirming the autogynephilia theory herself.

241
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,640
Now I'm certainly not gonna deny that trans people on the internet

242
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,440
can sometimes behave like a bit of an angry mob.

243
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,200
In fact, I may be on the receiving end

244
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,920
of one of those myself in about, oh, 20 minutes,

245
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,840
depending on how this video is received.

246
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,960
But there's not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression

247
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,960
from the Blanchard and Bailey camp either.

248
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,200
Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors,

249
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,160
and Drager is an advocate for the narcissistic rage theory

250
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,080
of trans backlash against Bailey.

251
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,640
Remember, according to autogynephilia theory,

252
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:07,520
many trans women are erotically fixated on themselves,

253
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,320
from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap

254
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,160
to saying that they're narcissists,

255
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:12,640
and hence,

256
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,360
any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation

257
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:20,000
is accused of exhibiting narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego.

258
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,160
Furthermore, like so many other professors in recent academic freedom controversies,

259
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,000
Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly silenced by PC cucks

260
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,040
has not really interfered with their academic careers,

261
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,800
nor their continued authority to misrepresent people with less power than them.

262
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,680
This is of course assuming that autogynephilia really is a misrepresentation of trans women,

263
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,400
and that's really the crux of this whole drama, isn't it?

264
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,000
So let's just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question,

265
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,760
pursuing the pure light of truth,

266
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
as we always do on this channel,

267
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,800
relying only on the facts,

268
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,520
the figures,

269
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,960
the scientific studies.

270
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,760
Just kidding.

271
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,120
If you really want to read a scientific argument against autogynephilia,

272
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,880
read Julia Serrano's article,

273
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,640
The Case Against Autogynephilia,

274
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,160
which pretty much sums it up.

275
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,320
Because I know that you didn't click on this video because you wanted to hear about science,

276
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,400
you came here because you wanted filth,

277
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,080
and I'll give you filth, Bailey.

278
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,680
I know that's what you want,

279
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
and I wanna give you what you want.

280
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,280
I wanna give it all up for you.

281
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,160
5. The False Dichotomy

282
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,080
Filth is coming, don't worry,

283
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,200
but before we get there there's one more thing we need to discuss.

284
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,640
Advocates of Blanchard's theory pretty much unanimously introduce it

285
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,600
as if it were the only possible alternative to what's called

286
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,520
The Feminine Essence Theory.

287
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,000
The Feminine Essence Theory says that trans women are female souls and male bodies,

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,680
that we are women from birth to death,

289
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,020
path, and that transition is merely an effort to make our accidental exterior match our

290
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,600
essential interior.

291
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:54,000
People like Draeger will tell you that TRANSACTIVISTS dogmatically adhere to this theory, and that

292
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
anyone who challenges it will be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt.

293
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,480
And of course, the only way to challenge it, we're told, is to defer to Blanchard's

294
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:05,240
typology of homosexual and autogynephilic transsexuals.

295
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:09,440
Now I object to this framing of the discussion, because I don't believe in Blanchard's

296
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,060
typology or the feminine essence theory.

297
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,320
There is no feminine singularity that made me a woman from birth.

298
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,160
I wasn't born a woman.

299
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:21,240
I was born a fucking baby, just like everyone else.

300
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,780
There's no such thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence.

301
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:29,640
There's only biology, habitual behavior, and the way society responds to you, all of which

302
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,620
can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are currently changing for me.

303
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,660
Now there is an emotional appeal to the feminine essence theory.

304
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,440
I think most people have gender essentialist intuition.

305
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:45,060
And I admit I do feel, on some level, that I'm supposed to be a woman by nature.

306
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,900
And in a sense that may be true.

307
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,940
I don't think I chose to be trans, and it seems likely that there's something inherent

308
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,520
in my biology or psychology that led me to transition.

309
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:59,000
But that's not quite the same thing as essential womanhood, which intellectually I don't

310
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,180
think makes sense.

311
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,080
I think it's heartwarming gibberish.

312
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,220
But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish.

313
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,060
Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans.

314
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,660
To a person who believes that dogs go to heaven.

315
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:18,120
And in most circumstances, saying I'm a female soul in a male body gets the point across.

316
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,280
Not all language is philosophical.

317
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:24,220
It's a lot easier to explain what being trans is in essentialist terms.

318
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:28,820
To explain it without gender essentialism requires a whole complicated philosophical

319
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:32,240
discussion that most people simply aren't up to having.

320
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,320
But the useful platitudes become a problem when more analytically-minded people start

321
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,400
putting these things under the microscope.

322
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,940
And then they end up concluding that trans people are just fetishists who are telling

323
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,440
lies about themselves.

324
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,580
So you're probably wondering, if I'm not a fetishist, and not essentially a woman,

325
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,580
then why am I transitioning?

326
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:53,640
Well, I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was the primary reason.

327
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,880
And shortly before I transitioned, I made a whole video about that, if you're curious.

328
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,080
You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom.

329
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,860
When you decide you're going to live as a woman, you have to do that at the grocery

330
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,400
store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family.

331
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
You have to do that at the grocery store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with

332
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
your family.

333
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
You have to do that at the grocery store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner

334
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
with your family, if you even still have a family.

335
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,080
It's kind of hard for me to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory

336
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,080
urge.

337
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,880
That said, is there some sexual aspect of being transgender?

338
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,160
Well of course there goddamn is, how could an adult decide to switch genders without

339
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,260
there being some connection to sexuality?

340
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:30,780
The problem is, autogynephilia is not a good description of that connection in most cases,

341
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:33,200
and it certainly isn't in my case.

342
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,400
But I'm a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women and cross-dressing

343
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,760
in erotic situations, no less.

344
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,920
According to Blanchard's theory, I'm therefore an autogynephile.

345
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,400
It seems that I have some explaining to do.

346
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:48,400
Well, here's where the filth comes in.

347
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,400
6.

348
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,520
Contrapoints in erotic life

349
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,400
Come one, come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie.

350
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,580
Step right up, you filthy freaks.

351
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:01,440
One of the reasons it's difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard's theory is that

352
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,080
even arguing against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and

353
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,080
invalidating.

354
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:11,360
Unfortunately, I have no sense of self-respect or dignity whatsoever, so I'm willing to take

355
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,640
one for the team here.

356
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,300
Get your clipboards out, gentlemen!

357
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:19,080
I want to make this as easy as possible for the psychoanalysts at home.

358
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,520
I was born in 1988.

359
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,960
As a small child, I was not especially feminine nor especially masculine.

360
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:31,040
I was not interested in sports, and was just kind of physically inept.

361
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:34,840
My main childhood interest was music, and I learned several instruments.

362
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,960
In early adolescence, I was misdiagnosed with OCD.

363
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,580
The primary symptoms being spending too much time in the shower, and spending too much

364
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,200
time styling my hair.

365
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
My sexual development was kind of late.

366
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,160
I never masturbated till I was 15.

367
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:54,340
And I didn't fantasize about having sex with women, or with men, or even about becoming

368
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,340
a woman.

369
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,040
My fantasies were kind of platonic, almost.

370
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,740
I would sort of fantasize about women, but in a very abstract kind of way.

371
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,920
An early romantic disappointment involved my realization that women would never be a

372
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,920
woman.

373
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,960
They would be attracted to me in the same way that I was attracted to them.

374
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,520
In my late teens and early twenties, I was a long-haired, smooth-chested androgyne, which

375
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,680
suited me well.

376
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:21,360
It was around then that I first cross-dressed, when a woman I was seeing asked if she could

377
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,540
dress me up in her clothes, and do my makeup.

378
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,320
God yes, I said.

379
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,040
Throughout my twenties, I was on and off in relationships where there was this feminization

380
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,120
dynamic.

381
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:35,340
More women are into feminizing boys than you might think.

382
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,300
When I was feminized, it would just be me.

383
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,880
When I was feminized, we would just make out and not do anything penetrative, but just

384
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,120
sort of little proto-lesbian things, you know?

385
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:47,480
Now some women I was with were not into that, and some would practically lock their underwear

386
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,940
drawers when they found out I had done it in the past.

387
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,100
There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that altogether, but it didn't last

388
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,820
more than a couple years.

389
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:00,780
When I had regular heterosexual sex, it was like my soul had to leave my body in order

390
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,620
for me to get the poison out, which is how I thought of it.

391
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,300
The cross-dressing was never a solo or a masturbatory activity.

392
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:10,180
There was always a partner, or sometimes several partners.

393
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,480
Bailey, are you paying attention to this?

394
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,560
This is for you.

395
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,620
What I liked about it was the way that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted

396
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:20,760
with my body, how they would kind of treat me like a woman.

397
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,060
I fully acknowledge that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic.

398
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:31,060
There was a lot of short dresses and thigh highs, and occasionally also a BDSM submissive

399
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,160
aspect.

400
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,200
But over time, I realized that the fetish aspect wasn't really what I liked about it.

401
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
I didn't like it.

402
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,200
I didn't like it.

403
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,280
I didn't like it.

404
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:36,300
I didn't like it.

405
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
I didn't like it.

406
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,300
I didn't like it.

407
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,300
It wasn't humiliating for me to be feminized.

408
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,300
It was affirming.

409
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,740
And one day, I kind of realized that I didn't want to be feminized at all.

410
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,140
I wanted to be feminine.

411
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:51,440
In my mid-twenties, I first started really paying attention to trans women and thinking

412
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,240
about transitioning myself, but I thought that, since I didn't feel like a woman, that

413
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,180
I never would, and I thought that I would never pass and that I would just be a hideous

414
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,840
parody of womanhood.

415
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,200
Then about a year ago, thanks to this amazing online queer community that we have now, I

416
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,800
started developing more positive thinking about this.

417
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,840
I've always looked a little bit younger than my age, but last year I also started noticing

418
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:17,860
the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man, and that triggered

419
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,920
really intense gender dysphoria.

420
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,820
At the same time, I realized that I would have to transition to have any hope of a genuinely

421
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,260
fulfilling sex life.

422
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,240
And at that point, the need to transition felt so urgent that I could not wait.

423
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,200
So I got internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu, and I started taking those in

424
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,460
August until I could get a prescription from an informed consent clinic.

425
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:41,340
And since then, my life has drastically changed.

426
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:45,880
I live as a woman full-time now, and most of the changes aren't sexual, but the hormones

427
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:48,140
certainly do have sexual effects.

428
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,880
I now find myself attracted to both women and men, and the mere visual image of a woman

429
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,880
no longer turns me on the way it did.

430
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,900
Instead, I need there to be a certain kind of interpersonal connection.

431
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,640
I don't masturbate at all, and I haven't come in months.

432
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,400
Someone, please fuck me.

433
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:10,020
I guess the critical thing is that I've been wearing women's clothes, my clothes, for seven

434
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,820
consecutive months, and I have been turned on by it for zero percent of the time.

435
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:18,580
So the idea that I'm some kind of transvestite fetishist is ridiculous.

436
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,080
And I'm not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either.

437
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,920
I mean, when there's developments, I'll check it out.

438
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,700
But I'm not like, oh yeah, I have tits now, that's so hot.

439
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,000
I mean, it's kind of hot.

440
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,640
But it's more about other people being into it than it is about me.

441
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,700
Being into it.

442
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,300
So as always, my sex drive is directed outward at other people.

443
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,880
The sexual aspect of my transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed

444
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,980
inward.

445
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:49,640
It's about me wanting my sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body.

446
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,120
Or, you know, at least as close as I can get.

447
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,580
And since I started hormones, it's about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically

448
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,520
female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection.

449
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,520
Rather than being a woman.

450
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,060
Rather than intense, object-oriented male lust.

451
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,360
So that's my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to politically correct

452
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,440
cuckoldry or trans ideology.

453
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,960
Now I've read enough Blanchard to know that this description in no way lets me off the

454
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,960
hook for autogynephilia.

455
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,860
In fact, I'm what Blanchard would call a classic case of pseudobisexual behavioral autogynephilia.

456
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:33,020
Pseudobisexual because of course all trans women's experiences are lies, and because,

457
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:37,080
according to Blanchard, I only like guys because being filled up with their dicks makes

458
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,800
me feel like a girl, which is what I'm really into.

459
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:44,900
And behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogynephilia, like anatomic,

460
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:49,700
transvestic, behavioral, and physiological, according to what you supposedly fetishize.

461
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:54,320
And I'm turned on by sexually behaving like a woman, rather than simply wearing female

462
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
clothes or having female anatomy.

463
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,020
And I mean, okay, you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary, fake,

464
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,020
and pathological.

465
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,020
But I think this isn't a sense of reality.

466
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,020
It's an especially unfair way to characterize my experience, and here's why.

467
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,740
7.

468
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
Autophilia in general

469
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,680
I'm guessing that most people would be pretty reluctant to admit that they take any kind

470
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,980
of sexual interest in their own bodies.

471
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,840
It's sort of like admitting that you enjoy your own body odor.

472
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,840
Ew.

473
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,380
But how unusual is it to check yourself out?

474
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,980
To take some sexual interest in the sight or touch of your own body?

475
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:32,280
I've noticed that cis men seem to really like their own penises.

476
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,560
And taking pictures of their penises and sending them to other people.

477
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,140
Does that make them autoandrophiles?

478
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,000
Are they behavioral autophallophiles?

479
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I can make up Greek words too, Blanchard.

480
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,640
I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me,

481
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,160
It's not for men, it's for me.

482
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,160
What does that mean?

483
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,000
It means she enjoyed wearing sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel

484
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
hot.

485
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Is that cisvestic autogynephilia?

486
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
Likewise.

487
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,900
I used to date cis women, I know what they do, and I can tell you that women touching

488
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,640
their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon.

489
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,060
Is that anatomical autogynephilia?

490
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:18,160
Twitter user Nathan of Oz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo, an article

491
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:23,620
on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their own

492
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:28,980
feet or running a feather over their skin as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length

493
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,520
mirror and rubbing one out.

494
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,620
Possibly while squatting on a dildo.

495
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:37,480
Can you imagine the level of paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if

496
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,000
it was written by a trans woman?

497
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,720
I mean it's one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot.

498
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,480
And okay, Cosmo's sex advice is often ludicrous, but the point is, it seems like it's only

499
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,740
when it comes to trans women that we feel the need to whip out the suffix "-philia".

500
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:56,340
It seems what's going on here is a lot of pathologizing of normal female sexuality when

501
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,280
it exists in trans women.

502
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,420
But of course that raises the question, what is transphilia?

503
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:00,420
What is transphilia?

504
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,020
What is normal female sexuality?

505
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,980
8.

506
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:09,600
Normal Female Sexuality Switching from male to female hormones causes

507
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,220
your sex drive to be completely obliterated and then regrown in new form, which came as

508
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,620
more of a relief to me than I expected.

509
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,400
I don't think I realized the extent to which my own sexuality felt like a demonic possession

510
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,500
or alien infection until I was free of it, thank god.

511
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:29,660
When I had male hormones in me I needed to have an orgasm like every day, I was turned

512
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:34,820
on mainly by visual arousal cues, I was at a Kinsey 1 relative to my birth sex, and I

513
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:40,760
had a couple mild, typical, straight guy paraphilic kinks, no, not autogynephilia.

514
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,760
On female hormones I initially had no sex drive at all, but have started developing

515
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,960
very different patterns of arousal.

516
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,340
For instance, I never need to have an orgasm, I'm turned on mainly by interpersonal cues

517
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:58,000
like intimate physical contact or close emotional moments, I'm at around a 70-30 attraction

518
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,500
to women vs men.

519
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,220
And the paraphilic kinks have vanished without a trace.

520
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:07,840
Oh by the way, for the pharmacologists at home, this is 6mg estradiol and 200mg spironolactone

521
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,840
daily.

522
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:13,300
So my interpretation of all this is that I have what is a pretty typical female sexuality,

523
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,020
at least for a girl who's into girls.

524
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:20,360
I don't feel like I have some essentially male, pseudo-bisexual, behavioral autogynephilia.

525
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,300
One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with elaborate terminology like this is

526
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:28,800
he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women are psychologically more like

527
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,540
cis men than cis women.

528
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,020
His studies therefore lack a cis female control group, meaning he didn't bother to apply

529
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,600
his autogynephilia survey to cis women.

530
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,980
But if he had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were

531
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:44,140
classified as autogynephilic.

532
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:49,560
Blanchard's insistence on classifying trans women's sexuality as a variant on male sexuality

533
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:54,640
makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women.

534
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,140
But what do cis women want to have sex as?

535
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,140
Walruses?

536
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,720
I mean, no judgements.

537
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:05,900
This also explains his claim that non-exclusively androphilic trans women are pseudo-bisexual

538
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,920
because their attraction to men does not resemble gay male attraction to men.

539
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:15,460
The idea is that these trans women's attraction to men is not based on raw physical lust,

540
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,560
so it is therefore unlike gay male attraction to men, and is therefore pseudo.

541
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,180
That is, it's really an autogynephilic fantasy where the man is just a prop.

542
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,880
But what about straight cis women's attraction to men?

543
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,460
Is that based on raw physical lust for the male body?

544
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,200
I mean, sometimes it probably is, and I'm not a cis woman so I can't really say.

545
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:42,700
But I kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust

546
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,160
for the male body.

547
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,200
That is, I suspect it's quite different from cis male homosexuality, if I may risk

548
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,040
painting with broad strokes.

549
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,560
Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist articles alongside

550
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
Naked Hunks but never had the circulation of a trans woman.

551
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
It's not a real thing.

552
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,400
It's more of a representation of its male counterpart, and later on ended up just being

553
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:01,980
read by gay men.

554
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,240
From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean, men's bodies are nice, they have

555
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,860
great hands, great abs, great this part, it's all great.

556
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,460
But it's not that great.

557
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,420
And if you read pornography written by women, and notice that it's usually written and

558
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,840
not photographed, you don't find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies.

559
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,300
Like in Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read for research purposes, there's some description

560
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,880
of male bodies, but it's not the main thing by any means.

561
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,960
There's a lot more sentences like,

562
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,560
To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat ten adults comfortably.

563
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:42,620
It faces a state-of-the-art stainless steel, or maybe platinum for all I know.

564
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,980
Modern fireplace.

565
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:49,160
Near the kitchen area, in front of the glass wall, is a dining table surrounded by sixteen

566
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:50,160
chairs.

567
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,560
And tucked in the corner is a full-sized, shiny black grand piano.

568
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:57,440
Here, he hands me a glass of wine.

569
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,620
Even the glasses are rich, heavy, contemporary crystal.

570
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,340
It's like a Crate and Barrel catalog.

571
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,980
I'm getting so wet.

572
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,960
Christian is established as a man of good taste, as evinced by his contemporary crystal,

573
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,280
his playing Bach at the piano, and that's hot, because it's sexy to be wanted by someone

574
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,600
who's qualified.

575
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,720
It's not enough to be whistled at by a cat caller, they have no discernment.

576
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,200
I mean, they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female.

577
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,200
They whistle at me.

578
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,760
And I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

579
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

580
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:26,960
I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

581
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,440
I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.

582
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,320
You want to be wanted by someone who, with their exquisite and discriminating taste,

583
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,400
selects you, the protagonist.

584
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,360
This is not a story about Christian's rippling abs and his tight buns.

585
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,880
It's not a story about wanting a man.

586
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:44,160
It's a story about being wanted by a man.

587
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,440
This is how the whole romance genre works.

588
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:51,020
You emotionally identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who's like

589
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:56,560
a pirate or the CEO of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this

590
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:56,760
guy wants you.

591
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:02,460
The protagonist, usually singling her out over other more qualified women, and eventually

592
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,940
giving up everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her.

593
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,160
And a lot of these stories are kind of silly.

594
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:12,340
They conflate female sexuality with women's economic dependence on men in a way that's

595
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:18,660
really problematic, but I fundamentally resonate with the wish to be wanted.

596
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,000
I want other people to think I'm sexy and want to fuck me, you know?

597
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,540
It makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside.

598
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,540
Is that so wrong?

599
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,080
9.

600
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,320
Female Vanity

601
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:36,100
The art critic John Berger wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting

602
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:41,400
trope of depainting a nude woman with a mirror and calling the painting vanity.

603
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,940
The mirror was often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman.

604
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:47,680
The moralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.

605
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:51,060
You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her.

606
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:55,420
You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting vanity, thus morally condemning

607
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,560
the woman whose nakedness you despise.

608
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:56,600
9.

609
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,880
Female Vanity

610
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,700
The real function of the mirror was otherwise.

611
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:05,900
It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.

612
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:11,480
The notion of the vanity of woman is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection.

613
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:16,280
It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy

614
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:20,180
looking at them, and are hence complicit in their own objectification.

615
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:24,820
I think the concept of the autogynephilic transsexual woman is a combination of this

616
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,920
trope with a homophobic trope.

617
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:32,800
Misogyny casts women as narcissistic, vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts

618
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,280
queer men as hypersexual perverts.

619
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:40,080
The autogynephile is the ultimate combination of the two, the hypersexual pervert vainly

620
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,760
in love with the image of himself as a woman.

621
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,760
10.

622
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,000
Autogynephilia is a misogynistic trope that originates in the image of a woman.

623
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,840
It is a misogynistic trope that originates in the image of a woman.

624
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,800
10.

625
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,360
Autogynephilia is the ultimate combination of the two, the autogynephilia and the paraphilia

626
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
acceptance.

627
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,120
So this whole video I've been treating autogynephilia kind of like an accusation, from which I have

628
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,820
to exonerate myself.

629
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,120
And I think it's justifiable considering I'm objecting to misrepresentation, but some people

630
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,520
might wonder isn't this whole conversation getting kind of kink-shame-y, like, is autogynephilia

631
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
so wrong?

632
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,520
Well, no, it's not.

633
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,680
It's fine.

634
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,320
There definitely are men who get turned on by wearing women's clothes or thinking about

635
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,120
having a female body, and as paraphilias go, this is very harmless, and I don't think it's

636
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,100
anything to be ashamed of. But the question of whether genuinely autogynephilic trans women

637
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:34,520
exist is more complicated. The reason most trans women consider the label autogynephilia to be such

638
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:40,920
a stigma is that, as Blanchard says, women do not get turned on merely by the thought of being women.

639
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,960
Now as I've discussed, the problem with Blanchard is he overextends the concept of autogynephilia

640
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:51,420
to cover pretty much any sexual feeling a cluster B trans woman can have. But I'm actually inclined

641
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:56,900
to agree with him that being turned on merely by the thought of being a woman is a fundamentally

642
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,640
non-female state of mind, and one that feels quite foreign to me. So a lot of trans women,

643
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:06,540
I guess including me, have the idea that you can't be both a woman and an autogynephile,

644
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:11,220
hence the offense we take to being characterized in this way. However, things get messier when

645
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,560
you look into this some more. Are there some genuinely autogynephilic transsexuals?

646
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,440
Well, at first glance, the answer is yes. I mean, there's always one, isn't there?

647
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,400
In this case, though,

648
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:26,560
one is Anne Lawrence, a disciple of Blanchard and self-identified autogynephilic transsexual.

649
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:33,520
From 1998 to 2011, Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogynephilia over the internet

650
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:40,020
and published them in her 2012 book, Men Trapped in Men's Bodies. Great title, Anne. Very provocative,

651
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:46,080
very controversial, very politically incorrect. I have been triggered. Well done. What is this

652
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,220
cover, though? Come on, Anne. Get a statue of hermaphroditus or something on there.

653
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,400
So this book is filled with a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff.

654
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:55,660
It's a lot of the stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty autogynephilia-like

655
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:01,700
fantasy and behavior. So what do we make of that? Well, a lot of this stuff, like fantasies of being

656
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,360
women or having sex as women or arousal during cross-dressing, are what the trans community

657
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:11,700
has destigmatizingly termed cross-sex gender fantasy. And among trans women, particularly

658
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:17,540
prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty common. You'll see it all over the place on trans

659
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,380
subreddits. There's a blog called CrossDreamers devoted to it. There's a blog called CrossDreamers

660
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,180
devoted to it. It's been written about by Zinnia Jones and Giulia Serrano. So within the trans

661
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:30,160
community, this isn't even controversial. It's not provocative. It's not politically incorrect.

662
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,660
But how do we make sense of this? Well, my thinking is that it's pretty hard to experience

663
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,460
genuine female sexuality when you've still got the evil magic of testosterone in your system.

664
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:44,380
So you've got to get that out, and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away. But how is

665
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:48,800
this any different from Blanchard's theory of autogynephilia? Well, basically, it comes down to

666
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:51,380
this. Blanchard's theory claims that cross-dressing is a form of sexism. It's a form of sexism. It's a

667
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:56,880
gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential. In this theory, if you're an autogynephilic

668
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,440
transsexual, you are essentially male, and any facsimile of womanhood you achieve can only be

669
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:07,980
honestly understood as the expression of an essentially male sexual urge. I reject the idea

670
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,420
that it's causal or essential, and I think the strongest piece of evidence that it isn't essential

671
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,840
is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogynephilic admit that after transition,

672
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,400
the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes,

673
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,360
yet they continue to prefer living as trans women. Blanchard made this observation himself.

674
00:36:50,400 --> 00:37:00,720
If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become women, why would they

675
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,940
continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away? Well, this is where

676
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,840
things get really weird. According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only way to explain this is to

677
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:15,760
shift the goalpost and say that actually, autogynephilia isn't a paraphilia at all.

678
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,360
It's actually a sexual orientation. So what happens when you transition is you

679
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,080
actually pair-bond with yourself, forming a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman you've

680
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:31,280
become. And if that sounds like it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all, it's because it doesn't.

681
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,920
A pair-bond is a social relationship between two or more people. Are you saying that trans women

682
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,960
are a man and a woman inside this- why do they continue falling in love with other people-

683
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,560
I can't even start with this. This video is too long, I'm getting cranky. Look, this seems like

684
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,400
the point where Occam's Razor shuts down Blanchard's theory. Like, okay, maybe I subconsciously created

685
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:55,920
a female alter-ego with which my original male ego has fallen in love. But maybe lots of things.

686
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:01,200
Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father. Maybe the elder gods ripped

687
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,400
my primordial duality in twain, and now I'm yearning for my female half. Or maybe I'm just

688
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,120
a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while.

689
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,680
11. True autogynephiles

690
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,480
Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence's book, there are, admittedly, a few accounts of trans

691
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,320
women whose primary sexuality is the same as that of a woman who has a male ego. And that's because

692
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,000
a woman's sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does appear to be genuinely

693
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,480
autogynephilic. And I'm not gonna say that these people are lying about their experiences,

694
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,080
because that would be a terrible thing to do. Ultimately, ContraPoints is not a channel about

695
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:39,200
judging people, so I'm not gonna say that these people aren't really trans. I mean, I find it

696
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:45,200
weird and hard to imagine, but whatever. I'm the one who's into people licking milk off my tits.

697
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,680
And wait till you see my sex robot. And look, if I had autogynephilic feelings,

698
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,920
I would just tell you. I've already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn't tell my own

699
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,360
diary on my deathbed. But I just don't. This theory doesn't describe my conscious motivations

700
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,600
to transition. And that's ultimately the reason most trans women hate this theory,

701
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,520
not because of wounded narcissism or shattered erotic delusions. We just

702
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,280
don't like being misrepresented. But you know who does love this theory?

703
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,120
She's been there literally the whole time.

704
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:19,360
You know, I realize that by talking about this, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of ruthless,

705
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,080
psychoanalysis. Whether it's gonna come from TERF Reddit, or trans people who are mad at me for

706
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:30,000
even talking about this, or who knows, maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves. So you know what,

707
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,560
why don't we just get that out of the way right now. It's time to put this tranny on trial.

708
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,320
12. The Autogynephilia Trial of ContraPoints

709
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:44,160
All rise. The Autogynephilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session.

710
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,520
Judge Bailey presiding.

711
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
Calling the case of the gender-critical subreddit versus

712
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,520
ContraPoints. Are both sides ready?

713
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:56,320
District Attorney Cockbane, ready for the subreddit, Your Honor?

714
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,960
Ready, I guess.

715
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:04,160
Your Honor, ladies of the subreddit, the defendant is a man. A full-grown,

716
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:07,280
six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress.

717
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,200
It's really more of a hospital gown?

718
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:13,520
The evidence will show that the defendant is not a woman, but a male pervert,

719
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,040
role-playing as such, for his own twisted sexual amusement.

720
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,640
Abigail, what are you holding?

721
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,480
It's for horseback riding.

722
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,320
Your Honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip,

723
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,240
uploaded to YouTube by the defendant on June 13th, 2016.

724
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,120
Oh, God.

725
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:43,920
Fishnets, garter belts, corsets. If these are not the trappings of an autogynephile,

726
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:48,400
then I don't have 2x chromosomes. Agreed. Well, what do you have to say for yourself?

727
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,080
Well, why do you think I had all that fetish stuff in the first place?

728
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,520
The court does not need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals.

729
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,600
I bought that stuff for Rocky Horror.

730
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,320
What?

731
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:02,000
Rocky Horror Picture Show. I used to do Frankenfurter.

732
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,280
Your Honor, I'd like to admit into evidence the following photograph.

733
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:09,840
That's me at E Street Cinema in 2014. This one's on the house, Kiwi Farms.

734
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,840
Are you a Rocky Horror fan, Your Honor?

735
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,400
Am I?

736
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:17,600
It's just a jump to the left and take a step to the right.

737
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,240
Put your hands on your hips.

738
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:26,880
And bring your knees in tight. But it's the pelvic thrust.

739
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:27,600
Ew.

740
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,480
So you liked to dress up as another cross-dressing autogynephile.

741
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,240
How is that helping your case at all?

742
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:36,080
Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic.

743
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:37,280
But when you're living as a man,

744
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:41,280
there aren't a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try out cross-dressing.

745
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,400
You know, it's basically Rocky Horror, Halloween,

746
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,680
pretty much any time it's socially allowed to be a freakish monster.

747
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:48,640
And come to think of it,

748
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,760
the scary monster autogynephile is a trope I've played with since the beginning of this channel.

749
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,320
The whole ContraPoints aesthetic is very like autogynephilia-chic.

750
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,640
I originally was going to have the narrator of this channel be more of a fictional character.

751
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,160
The idea was to be like autogynephile Harry Plinkett.

752
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,480
And part of that is that I kind of hated myself.

753
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,400
I thought I was just disgusting.

754
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,440
Part of it is that representing yourself as a scary monster

755
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,800
actually does capture something of the horror of gender dysphoria.

756
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,640
And part of it is that identifying with the horror of gender dysphoria,

757
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,520
with a scary monster version of yourself is actually kind of empowering, like cis feminists,

758
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:29,880
you have your thing about witches. Okay, but monster version or not, real women do not wear

759
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,340
fishnets and garter belts and corsets. This is just male fetishism. Well, it's true that cis

760
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:39,360
women generally don't dress that way, no. I mean, unless they're doing Rocky Horror, it's actually

761
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:43,640
pretty popular. But I never wear shit like that anymore. In fact, it actually causes gender

762
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:47,900
dysphoria because it makes me feel like a male cross-dresser. Sometimes trans women start out

763
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:52,760
with a fairly male conception of what women wear. I guess that's true. A lot of trans women

764
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:57,680
transition after a period of sort of trying things out as a cross-dresser or a drag queen.

765
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:01,860
But you know, it takes time to develop an authentic sense of female fashion. Like,

766
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,680
what did you wear when you were 14?

767
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:14,400
That's what I thought. But also, why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters?

768
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:17,640
Cis women do. They have some good ideas. Without

769
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:17,880
drag queens and kinksters, they don't have any.

770
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,440
Without drag queens and kinksters, we'd have no contouring, no chokers. And what would we do then,

771
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:26,640
Abigail? What would we do then? I don't know what you would do. I think I could manage.

772
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,600
Your Honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following clip.

773
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:35,260
Is there a way to smash my ribs in? I'll smash them in. I'll smash the shit out of them.

774
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,000
These shoes are cute, and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.

775
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:47,880
Would you fuck me? I wouldn't. Your Honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and

776
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:53,480
corsets in front of a mirror before posing to himself the question, would you fuck me? This,

777
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,240
Your Honor, is peak trans.

778
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:06,920
How do we even need to have a trial about this? Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish,

779
00:44:07,060 --> 00:44:11,720
not sexual pleasure. Would you fuck me is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs,

780
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:16,920
and is what is known in the trans community as a joke. The corsets, the high heels, these were

781
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:17,840
primitive efforts.

782
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:22,300
at clawing my way out of manhood, and they're efforts that I've left behind. Now that I'm on

783
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:27,100
female hormones and I live this way full-time, I feel the way I'm supposed to feel, and I don't

784
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:31,480
need to lean on that stuff for validation. I mean, I still do some things that cis women don't do.

785
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:36,380
I sleep in a bra, which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done. I do it because I need to

786
00:44:36,380 --> 00:44:41,820
feel something, God, anything, taking up space on my chest. And feeling that reassures me enough

787
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:46,060
that I can fall asleep. Not so I can look at myself in the mirror, not so I can get off,

788
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,780
so I can simply fall asleep.

789
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,440
No one ever claimed that trans women are literally the same as cis women. We have many experiences

790
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:56,540
in common, but in other ways our experiences are very different. Yes, and you don't have the

791
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:01,640
oppression experiences that cis women have. Well, you know what, Abigail? You're right. For the most

792
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,260
part, I don't. But it's impossible for us to have an actual conversation about this because you're

793
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:10,400
just such a fucking asshole. And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression

794
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:15,240
experiences, don't have this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago.

795
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,720
Go find someone who transitioned decades ago,

796
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,400
and talk to them about their experiences as women.

797
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,920
Your honor, the defendant does not bleed. I find that pretty conclusive.

798
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,600
As do I. Guilty as charged.

799
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,200
13. Final Thoughts

800
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,160
I think some cis people will be very congratulatory towards me for making this video. Some of them will

801
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:39,200
say things like, why can't all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their experiences

802
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:43,680
as you? Well, I'm very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I'd like cis people to

803
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:44,000
think a little bit harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this. It's not just me, it's

804
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:44,080
not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me,

805
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:47,600
it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me.

806
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,320
It's humiliating, it's exhausting, and it's required me to publicize a detailed analysis

807
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:56,560
of my most private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me. I've had

808
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:01,280
to discuss things that I'm honestly terrified to discuss, because I'm afraid that people will never

809
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:06,160
take me seriously as a woman, hence ruining any chance I have at happiness. For trans women,

810
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,720
this debate is intensely personal and risky. Our lives and happiness are at stake.

811
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,440
Meanwhile, Blanchard and Bailey are not just neutral,

812
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,560
devoted pursuers of scientific truth. They've continuously and needlessly been derisive and

813
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:23,680
cruel toward trans people, and they've misused their power as academic authorities to misrepresent

814
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:28,880
and humiliate us. No part of my present experience corresponds to the core claim of their theory.

815
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:32,960
I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity,

816
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,960
but I am at core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself. So I have to hope,

817
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,960
for the sake of my own happiness, that someday I will be loved by someone who

818
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:46,080
thinks of me as a woman. Otherwise, I'm fucked.

819
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,400
This was a rough one girls, I dare say you've earned a song!

820
00:46:54,880 --> 00:47:03,440
Thanks For the times that you've given me

821
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,600
The memories are all onto my mind

822
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:11,840
And now it's my turn For the times that you've given me

823
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:12,140
And now it's my turn

824
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:12,880
And now it's my turn

825
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:12,940
And now it's my turn

826
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:27,940
Now we've come to the end of our rainbow There's something I must say out loud

827
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:50,940
You're once, twice, three times a lady And I love all of you, yes I do

828
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:56,940
Yes, you're once, twice

829
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:02,940
Three times a lady

830
00:48:03,940 --> 00:48:10,940
And I love all of you, yes I do

831
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:18,940
And I love you

832
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:21,940
One more time

833
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,940
And just a step to the right

834
00:48:25,940 --> 00:48:26,940
Put your hands on your hips!

835
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,940
And bring your knees in tight

836
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,940
It's just a pelvic thrust

837
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:37,940
That really drives me insane

838
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:42,940
Let's do the time warp again

839
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:49,940
Let's do the time warp again
