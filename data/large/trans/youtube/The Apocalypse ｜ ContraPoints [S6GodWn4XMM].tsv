0	11240	Bring me another bottle of Moab, told you Antoine. Apparently the world is ending.
11240	13520	But where is he?
13520	20880	Sometimes I'm so goddamn beautiful it makes me want to throw up. Ugh, I'll get it myself.
30000	53000	Antoine? There you are. Ugh, it's this nerd again.
53000	59000	Hey, Doc. Can you bring me my smelling salts, please?
59000	60000	I'll think about it.
60000	62000	Have you watched my video yet?
62000	64000	The one about the apocalypse?
64000	68000	No, Marie. It's not about the apocalypse. It's about how to stop climate change.
68000	75000	You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice.
75000	76000	Well, I can't stand that.
76000	79000	Well, why don't you watch a few minutes and then I'll bring you your smelling salts.
79000	84000	This is extortion. You're singing to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat.
84000	87000	My God. You cucks will stop at nothing.
87000	89000	That's right. Open wide.
89000	90000	No.
90000	92000	No.
92000	93000	No.
96000	100000	Welcome to the lab. The lab of aesthetic climatology.
100000	103000	Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now?
103000	106000	Imagine that this is the Earth.
106000	110000	This is what the Earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife.
110000	115000	In 1976, a beta cuck named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming.
115000	119000	For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness
119000	121000	about the grave predictions of climate science.
121000	126000	In particular, the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions.
126000	132000	Gore's activism culminated in 2006 with the release of his documentary An Inconvenient Truth.
132000	137000	But a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park ridiculing Gore
137000	142000	as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation about a mythological creature called Man-Bear-Pig.
142000	147000	It is half man, half bear, and half pig.
147000	151000	The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic attention-seeking alarmist,
151000	155000	an issue-haver, a care-about, a sibilant moral f**k.
155000	158000	I'm super serial, you guys.
161000	164000	We all had a good laugh at Gore's foolishness.
164000	171000	After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news.
171000	176000	And in fact, a lot of us probably remember Man-Bear-Pig better than we remember An Inconvenient Truth.
177000	181000	A lot of the backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay
181000	184000	Why Are You So Angry? by Innuendo Studios.
184000	188000	Part two of the essay describes a phenomenon I'll call the Angry Jack Effect.
188000	189000	It works like this.
189000	192000	You're at a barbecue shoving brisket into your front hole
192000	197000	when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they're vegan.
197000	200000	Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan
200000	202000	because, even if they're not really judging you,
202000	207000	the mere fact that they're a vegan means that they probably have reasons
207000	208000	for not eating meat.
208000	212000	And that means there might be reasons why you shouldn't eat meat.
212000	215000	So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell them,
215000	217000	Oh, so you think you're better than me, huh?
217000	222000	Well, I'll have you know that eating meat is perfectly natural and, um, evolution
222000	226000	and people who don't eat meat, well, their bones fall out.
226000	228000	And besides, you're a hypocrite anyway
228000	233000	because more animals die when they plow the fields for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.
233000	236000	Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation.
236000	240000	This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt,
240000	243000	from the potential accusation that you're a bad person,
243000	248000	and you're protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat.
248000	252000	And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades.
252000	255000	He's a fun ruiner criticizing our high-emission way of life,
255000	258000	and instead of engaging sincerely with the critique,
258000	261000	we lash out at him so we don't have to think about it.
261000	265000	The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real,
265000	267000	and Gore was right all along.
270000	275000	So now it's current year, and the global temperature has risen 1°C above the pre-industrial average,
275000	278000	which is on track with the projections presented in Gore's film.
278000	281000	Now, 1°C doesn't sound like much, but to get a sense of scale,
281000	287000	consider that the last ice age was only 4.5°C cooler than the 20th century norm.
287000	290000	We are already at 1°C warmer than the pre-industrial average,
290000	295000	and current scientific models put us on track for 3°C warmer by the end of the century.
295000	300000	An outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami.
300000	305000	Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to 2°C in order to avert global cataclysm.
305000	308000	But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
308000	314000	warns that even 2°C of warming could result in an iceless Arctic summer at least once a decade,
314000	316000	the destruction of nearly every coral reef,
316000	320000	and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world.
320000	324000	The report therefore recommends that we limit warming to 1.5°C,
324000	329000	a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years,
329000	331000	and net zero emissions by 2050.
331000	336000	But even limiting warming to 2°C requires a significant reduction in emissions.
336000	341000	Otherwise, we're on track for 3°C of warming, and possibly even 4°C or more,
341000	344000	a situation that could be near apocalyptic.
344000	349000	Look, Doc, this is just the same liberal media bullshit we've all heard for decades.
349000	351000	Weather changes sometimes.
351000	353000	You were just talking about the ice age.
353000	355000	First it was cold, now it's getting warmer.
355000	356000	That's just nature.
356000	360000	Do you honestly think that all the world's leading climate scientists
360000	365000	just forgot to take into account that weather changes sometimes?
365000	368000	Isn't it obvious to you that this whole guilt trip about carbon emissions
368000	370000	is just an attack on the American way of life,
370000	374000	another excuse for big government to take away my freedom?
374000	376000	What freedom? Are you an oil company?
376000	378000	Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company?
378000	379000	Isn't that what you liberals think?
379000	381000	My identity is valid.
381000	382000	No, it isn't.
382000	384000	Bring me my smelling salts.
384000	385000	Watch the goddamn video.
389000	391000	Imagine the year is 2100.
391000	394000	I want you to picture the Earth as a human vagina,
394000	396000	and imagine you're a gynecologist,
396000	400000	and you're using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon.
400000	402000	How does that make you feel, kids?
402000	407000	I bet you wish your irresponsible, gas-guzzling parents had done something to stop this.
407000	410000	So, we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching,
410000	415000	but at least our political leaders are responsible, rational, and scientifically literate, right?
415000	417000	Is there climate change yet?
417000	419000	Will it go back like this?
419000	420000	I mean, will it change back?
420000	422000	Probably, that's what I think.
422000	423000	I believe it goes this way.
423000	427000	Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial,
427000	430000	from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax
430000	432000	aimed at undermining American manufacturing,
432000	435000	to his tweet last week that it's very cold outside,
435000	437000	therefore, whatever happened to global warming?
437000	439000	Of course, the term global warming refers to
439000	442000	the increase in the global average temperature,
442000	444000	temperature continuing to vary by region.
444000	447000	In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder,
447000	451000	for instance, if the ocean current known as the Atlantic Conveyor Belt is disrupted,
451000	455000	chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe.
455000	457000	But Trump doesn't know or care about any of that.
457000	460000	He's kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know?
460000	463000	A real man, who takes what he wants by any means necessary,
463000	467000	and won't be slowed down by any worries about what's factual,
467000	469000	or scientific, or true, or good,
469000	473000	or consensual, or just, or safe, or legal, or even possible.
473000	476000	He's the kind of man who Americans collectively want,
476000	479000	on some sub-rational, erotic level,
479000	482000	to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god emperor.
482000	484000	Burn the scholars! Build the wall!
484000	487000	But the problem, at least for those of you who don't actively enjoy
487000	490000	civilization's plunge into primeval darkness,
490000	493000	is that the notion that there's any actual scientific controversy
493000	497000	about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false.
497000	500000	A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change
500000	503000	found that 97% of papers published on the subject
503000	506000	supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming,
506000	509000	and the consensus has only increased over time.
509000	511000	Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe,
511000	513000	but is very common in America,
513000	518000	largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation
518000	521000	that goes back to the early 1990s,
521000	524000	when the Western Fuels Association developed a strategy to
524000	525000	quote,
525000	528000	They positioned global warming as theory, not fact,
528000	531000	and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way
531000	534000	to promote that message via a propaganda campaign.
534000	538000	Climate denialist talking points, promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades,
538000	542000	have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family,
542000	545000	and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians,
545000	548000	perhaps most vocally, Senator James Inhofe,
548000	551000	whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies,
551000	554000	and who's presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments
554000	556000	as throwing a snowball to own the libs.
559000	563000	Denialist talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords
563000	565000	to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins,
565000	568000	where they provide ammunition for the angry jack effect.
568000	572000	Just like Al Gore, or any messenger of inconvenient information,
572000	576000	climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment.
576000	579000	Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph,
579000	582000	has received thousands of hate messages, death threats,
582000	584000	even white powder in the mail.
584000	587000	The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering
587000	591000	as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation,
591000	594000	and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future.
594000	596000	It's likely that this video will attract some deniers,
596000	600000	and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource
600000	603000	listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as
603000	606000	there's still scientific controversy about the cause of climate change,
606000	609000	there isn't, what if the sun is getting hotter,
609000	611000	it's not, at least in the relevant timeframe,
611000	613000	and science is a liar sometimes.
614000	616000	But even if you don't believe in science,
616000	619000	maybe you'll find it convincing that even many oil companies,
619000	622000	including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real
622000	624000	and caused by human activity.
624000	626000	In fact, at the behest of oil companies,
626000	630000	the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds
630000	633000	to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast,
633000	636000	largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides
636000	638000	and more severe tropical storms.
638000	642000	After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion
642000	643000	to quote,
643000	645000	future-proof the state,
645000	647000	despite the fact that many of its top politicians
647000	649000	are public climate change deniers.
649000	652000	You remember how it used to be called global warming?
652000	654000	And then magically the theory changed to climate change?
654000	655000	Sure.
655000	656000	The reason is it wasn't warming.
656000	660000	Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids.
660000	661000	The science is clear.
661000	663000	Climate change is real and humans are causing it.
663000	666000	If even ExxonMobil says it's real,
666000	667000	it's probably real.
667000	669000	There's really no point in digging in your heels
669000	671000	and refusing to look at the evidence
671000	672000	just because you don't want it to be true.
673000	675000	None of us want it to be true.
676000	678000	Okay, fine.
678000	681000	So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer.
681000	684000	And maybe humans have something to do with it.
684000	686000	Now can you give me my smelling salts?
686000	687000	Fine.
689000	691000	Look, Doc, I gotta say,
691000	692000	maybe the scientists are right.
692000	694000	Maybe it is happening.
694000	696000	But to be honest with you,
696000	698000	I'm having a hard time caring about this.
698000	699000	Like, at all.
699000	701000	How can you not care about this?
701000	702000	We're talking about the future of the planet.
702000	704000	Well, I don't care about the planet.
704000	705000	I care about me.
705000	707000	Well, don't you live on the planet?
707000	708000	Mm-hmm.
708000	711000	And don't you care what happens to the planet you live on?
712000	713000	No.
713000	714000	God damn it.
714000	715000	Watch the video.
719000	721000	If you picture the Earth as a watermelon,
721000	722000	you can see there's the outer shell here
722000	724000	that traps the red flesh.
724000	725000	And if you leave it out at midnight,
725000	726000	the stalkers...
727000	729000	The stalkers come for the red flesh.
729000	731000	Before describing the details of our doom,
731000	734000	let's take a moment to review how we got where we are.
734000	736000	The modern science of anthropogenic climate change
736000	738000	began in 1896,
738000	741000	when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arrhenius
741000	743000	published a study titled
743000	745000	On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air
745000	747000	Upon the Temperature of the Earth,
747000	750000	in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production
750000	752000	would eventually have a warming effect on the planet.
752000	754000	By 1960, scientists had demonstrated
754000	756000	that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere
756000	758000	was in fact rising,
758000	760000	and President Buckin-Johnson's science advisory
760000	763000	committee warned that industrial CO2 emissions
763000	765000	could have a greenhouse warming effect.
765000	767000	The Stanford Research Institute warned
767000	771000	the American Petroleum Institute in 1968
771000	773000	that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting
773000	775000	and rising sea levels.
775000	778000	But nothing was really done about it until 1988,
778000	780000	when NASA announced to the US Senate
780000	783000	that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history,
783000	785000	that the warming could be attributed to human causes
785000	787000	with 99% certainty,
787000	789000	and that the warming was worsening heat waves,
789000	791000	storms, and droughts.
791000	793000	That same year, the IPCC was formed
793000	795000	to provide world leaders with a summary
795000	797000	of the science on climate change
797000	799000	and its political and economic impacts.
799000	802000	So it started to seem like something was going to change.
802000	804000	But by the early 1990s,
804000	806000	the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry
806000	808000	was up and running in the United States,
808000	810000	despite the fact that oil companies
810000	813000	had known climate change was happening for decades,
813000	815000	and Republican politicians became mouthpieces
815000	817000	for the so-called skeptic cause.
817000	819000	Meanwhile, the Clinton administration
819000	821000	signed the Kyoto Protocol,
821000	824000	pledging the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
824000	827000	a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on.
827000	829000	The 2012 Republican platform stated,
829000	831000	against all scientific consensus, that
831000	832000	quote,
838000	840000	Then, finally, in 2015,
840000	842000	things seemed to be changing for the better.
842000	845000	195 nations, including China, India,
845000	847000	and the United States under Obama,
847000	849000	became parties to the Paris Agreement,
849000	851000	which established the goal of limiting
851000	853000	the increase in global temperature
853000	855000	to well below 2 degrees Celsius.
855000	857000	By the very next year, Donald Trump
857000	859000	was elected President of the United States
859000	861000	on a platform of outright climate science denial.
861000	863000	Trump has since begun withdrawing
863000	865000	the United States from the Paris Agreement,
865000	867000	appointed a climate change denier
867000	869000	the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,
869000	871000	and released his America First Energy Plan,
871000	874000	which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels.
874000	876000	So it's with a particular sense of doom
876000	878000	that we now receive the grim 2018 Iron Curtain.
879000	881000	The world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius,
881000	883000	resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps,
883000	885000	increased average temperatures,
885000	887000	increased extreme weather events,
887000	889000	and increased mosquito-borne illnesses
889000	891000	like malaria, dengue, and Zika.
891000	893000	If drastic action is taken
893000	895000	to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030,
895000	897000	and to net-zero carbon by 2050,
897000	899000	global warming will still increase
899000	901000	to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,
901000	903000	resulting in a doubling of populations
903000	905000	exposed to water and air pollution.
905000	907000	The global warming will increase
907000	909000	to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,
909000	911000	reducing water scarcity and drought,
911000	913000	and an estimated $10 trillion
913000	915000	in annual flood damage losses from sea-level rise.
915000	917000	But with the current political situation,
917000	919000	the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees
919000	921000	is quickly slipping out of reach.
921000	923000	By the end of this century,
923000	925000	we're likely to see at least 2 degrees of warming,
925000	927000	which will lead to the eventual displacement
927000	929000	of 200 million people in coastal regions.
929000	931000	3 degrees of warming will flood
931000	933000	many of the world's major coastal cities,
933000	935000	including Shanghai, Miami,
935000	937000	Osaka, Rio de Janeiro,
937000	939000	Alexandria, and Hong Kong.
939000	941000	4 degrees of warming will be close to the difference
941000	943000	between early 20th century temperatures
943000	945000	and the last ice age.
945000	947000	A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees
947000	949000	from island and coastal areas
949000	951000	will be exacerbated by severe droughts
951000	953000	and water scarcity,
953000	955000	trillions of dollars of damage to the economy,
955000	957000	famines, starvation, terrorism, and war.
957000	959000	So it's not just the poor polar bears
959000	961000	and coral reefs.
961000	963000	There are real human consequences to this.
963000	965000	See? This is why you should care.
965000	967000	It's not just about the planet,
967000	969000	it's about the millions of people who are going to die,
969000	971000	and their homes.
971000	973000	Oh, jeez, wow.
973000	975000	Gosh, that's really just too bad.
975000	977000	What kind of response is that?
977000	979000	Look, Doc,
979000	981000	people die all the time.
981000	983000	What am I supposed to do, cry about it?
983000	985000	No, you're supposed to take political action.
985000	987000	Yeah, I guess I
987000	989000	could do
989000	991000	that, but
991000	993000	this bath is
993000	995000	very relaxing.
995000	997000	Well, look, even if you only care
997000	999000	about yourself, you do realize that
999000	1001000	when the coastal cities flood,
1001000	1003000	we're going to have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right?
1003000	1005000	Are you going to be okay with that?
1005000	1007000	No.
1007000	1009000	Well, then you'd better do something to reduce carbon emissions.
1009000	1011000	No!
1011000	1013000	Well, then you'd better be ready to take in a lot of refugees.
1013000	1015000	No!
1015000	1017000	You do realize, right, that in a hundred years,
1017000	1019000	everyone is going to look back on people like you,
1019000	1021000	and they're going to hate you so much
1021000	1023000	for what you allowed to happen to this planet.
1023000	1025000	Well, those are future people.
1025000	1027000	I am alive now.
1027000	1029000	And besides, if what you're saying is true,
1029000	1031000	it's the apocalypse anyway, so why not just
1031000	1033000	party and enjoy ourselves, right?
1033000	1035000	But it's not the apocalypse, though.
1035000	1037000	Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form
1037000	1039000	of denialism, because we still have
1039000	1041000	a little bit of time to fix the problem.
1041000	1043000	Please, God, please,
1043000	1045000	just try to focus on solving the problem
1045000	1047000	while we still have time.
1047000	1049000	So, you're saying the world is ending. Cheers to that.
1049000	1051000	The world is not ending.
1051000	1053000	It's just getting shittier.
1053000	1055000	Well, what am I supposed to do about it?
1055000	1057000	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
1057000	1059000	Alright, let me just re-up here.
1059000	1061000	.
1061000	1063000	.
1063000	1065000	.

1093000	1095000	.
1095000	1097000	.
1097000	1099000	.
1099000	1101000	.
1101000	1103000	.
1103000	1105000	.
1105000	1107000	.
1107000	1109000	.
1109000	1111000	.
1111000	1113000	.
1113000	1115000	.
1115000	1117000	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
1143000	1144000	. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
1144000	1146460	If you want to do your part to stop climate change,
1146460	1148660	there are some lifestyle changes you can make.
1148660	1150380	You can use LED light bulbs,
1150380	1152680	you can drive a hybrid or electric car,
1152680	1154500	you can use public transportation,
1154500	1156500	you can try not to fly very often,
1156500	1157800	you can eat less red meat.
1157800	1160340	But the reality is, just 100 companies
1160340	1163680	are responsible for 71% of global emissions,
1163680	1165140	and the burden of stopping this
1165140	1167780	can't really be placed on individual consumers.
1167780	1170100	The companies themselves do not care.
1170100	1171200	Left to their own devices,
1171200	1173180	they will only pursue short-term profit.
1173180	1175440	They will ask the government to build them sea walls
1175440	1177660	while continuing to emit greenhouse gases.
1177660	1180200	Climate change is exactly the kind of problem
1180200	1183340	that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve.
1183340	1185100	The timeframe involved is short enough
1185100	1187720	that scientists can predict total catastrophe
1187720	1189160	in the foreseeable future,
1189160	1191560	but just long enough not to enter into
1191560	1194560	the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations.
1194560	1196320	So unless there's a drastic change
1196320	1197740	in the next couple decades,
1197740	1201180	this is going to be capitalism's great Chinese famine moment,
1201180	1203160	only potentially, it'll be much, much worse.
1203160	1205660	This is probably the most important issue
1205660	1207780	facing humanity in the 21st century,
1207780	1210640	so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary,
1210640	1212920	beginning with rapid political change.
1212920	1215700	If that means direct action, it means direct action.
1215700	1218020	For instance, organizing, participating in,
1218020	1220320	or supporting a massive general strike.
1220320	1222360	You also should demand that your politicians
1222360	1224700	take a strong stance against climate change
1224700	1226300	and the companies that cause it.
1226300	1229880	And if you're American, vote this monumental ding-dong
1229880	1233120	out of the Oval Office in 2020 before the entire planet
1233120	1235280	shrinks and transforms into a corn cob.
1240160	1241620	So let me get this straight.
1241620	1244980	You want me to go vegan, drive a Prius, and vote Democrat.
1244980	1246980	You're basically asking me to completely change
1246980	1249680	who I am as a person and become everything I hate.
1249680	1251240	Yeah, pretty much.
1251240	1252980	But it's not about what I want.
1252980	1255000	It's about what everyone has to do
1255000	1257120	to preserve the survival of humanity.
1257120	1261120	Well, electric cars, veganism.
1261120	1262560	Who can even afford that shit?
1263120	1266060	Well, you can't afford it if you drink less champagne.
1266060	1267860	I shall do no such thing.
1267860	1269440	Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco.
1269440	1273380	I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater.
1273380	1275180	You know, eating plant-based meals
1275180	1277180	actually costs less than eating meat.
1277180	1282180	Oh, okay, so just never again enjoy the morning aroma
1282340	1286400	of bacon sizzling on the skillet, barbecued ribs,
1286400	1291400	fried chicken, corn dogs, spicy pork belly, lamb chops,
1291400	1292040	bloody steaks.
1292040	1293040	Oh, okay, so just never again enjoy the morning aroma of bacon sizzling on the skillet, barbecued ribs, fried chicken, corn dogs, spicy pork belly, lamb chops, bloody steaks.
1293120	1294000	Mmm.
1294000	1297040	Ew, why do you wanna eat all that murdered animal flesh anyway
1297040	1299980	when you could eat pure, clean, and natural foods
1299980	1302880	like lentils, barley, and sprouts?
1302880	1306000	No, no, no, no, no.
1306000	1307580	I'd rather eat human shit.
1307580	1308760	Well, that's what you're gonna be eating
1308760	1310620	if the planet heats another few degrees.
1310620	1312980	How am I supposed to care about rising sea levels
1312980	1314720	when there's Muslims out there?
1314720	1315840	And Mexicans?
1315840	1318020	There could be Muslim Mexicans, for all I know.
1318020	1320800	Why is racist paranoia so compelling to you
1320800	1323120	when all the climate science in the world just bounces
1323120	1327840	that thick skull of yours so first of all you people think everything is racist and second
1328880	1334880	i guess i just need a villain you know who's the bad guy who am i afraid of what's the other team
1334880	1338720	your climate story has no antagonist is that really what it's gonna take
1338720	1346000	all right then why don't you take a long hard look out at the sea that's right there she is
1346000	1348160	now look right over there
