0	7000	Ladies and gentlemen, a fascist.
15000	24000	My fellow Americans, a war is about to be waged between everything you love and everything you hate.
24000	28000	Our very right to exist as a people is under attack.
28000	37000	Foreign invaders disguised as immigrants and refugees are being imported to our lands by a cabal of globalist elites.
37000	44000	And if we don't stop it soon, the result will be rape, chaos, and the end of civilization as we know it.
44000	48000	I want you to imagine the faces of your wives and children.
48000	53000	Picture their pure, white, innocent faces.
53000	56000	Now, watch as those same wives are violated,
56000	58000	those same children violated,
58000	63000	and dashed to pieces under the black boots of the Third World Horde.
63000	65000	Does that thought fill you with rage?
65000	66000	Good.
66000	69000	We must be prepared to fight.
69000	71000	To fight for our children,
71000	73000	and for our nation,
73000	74000	and for our history,
74000	76000	and for our culture.
76000	79000	To fight for the homeland we've always known,
79000	82000	and the people we've always loved.
82000	85000	Make America great again.
85000	87000	Hail Victory!
88000	101000	Ladies and gentlemen, a leftist.
109000	113000	So, actually, according to Hegel,
113000	117000	the for itself can only be actualized through the in itself,
117000	121000	so the individuation of the subject necessarily demands
121000	124000	the transcendence of the dialectical object
124000	129000	through the sublimation of negative materiality.
129000	132000	Oh, fuck you, you fucking racists!
132000	134000	Death to capitalism!
134000	136000	Hail Satan!
147000	162000	So, that speech didn't go too well, huh?
162000	164000	Well, what do you expect?
164000	166000	We have the politicians against us,
166000	168000	a media run by giant corporations,
168000	170000	and a complacent white middle class
170000	172000	that prefers order to justice.
172000	174000	Opposition to leftism is hardly surprising.
174000	176000	So, let's accept that all that's true.
176000	178000	The game is rigged. Fine.
178000	180000	Now, how do you respond to that situation?
180000	183000	Do you change nothing about your strategy at all
183000	185000	and then blame the system when the predictable happens?
185000	188000	Or do you try to improve your rhetoric somehow?
188000	190000	Look, I don't really need optics advice
190000	192000	from a bougie queer esthete
192000	193000	who puts style over substance
193000	195000	and thinks that shining a pink light on everything
195000	197000	can cover up her counter-revolutionary
197000	199000	Trotskyite tendencies.
199000	201000	I mean, are you even a communist?
201000	204000	No! I'm not a communist.
204000	205000	Well, why not?
205000	208000	Mmm! I like stuff.
208000	212000	I like this, and I like this, and I like this.
212000	214000	And that's why I can't be a communist.
214000	217000	Justine, you do realize that Marxism distinguishes
217000	220000	between private property and personal property, right?
220000	222000	You're allowed to own possessions,
222000	224000	you just can't exploit people by owning the means of production.
224000	227000	Well, most of my stuff was made by Chinese slaves.
227000	229000	Well, you should feel bad about that.
229000	231000	Look, I'm just trying to help you out here.
231000	233000	Queer eye for the Marxist-Leninist, you know.
233000	235000	Actually, I'm an anarcho-syndicalist.
235000	236000	Right.
236000	239000	Do you have any friends who aren't leftist militants?
241000	242000	That's what I thought.
242000	245000	You know, Tabby, people think you're weird.
245000	247000	And they're afraid of you.
247000	249000	Well, fascists are afraid of me.
249000	250000	Really?
250000	252000	Well, let's take a look at your Twitter feed.
252000	253000	Let's see.
253000	255000	We've got guillotines, Soviet memes,
255000	257000	liberals get the bullet too.
257000	259000	Bitch, no wonder why everyone thinks
259000	260000	you're some kind of scary terrorist.
260000	261000	Okay, Jesus.
261000	263000	Let's hear your mind-blowing revelations
263000	264000	about respectability policy.
265000	267000	Great.
267000	270000	Let's start by taking a look at these patches and pins.
270000	271000	Positives first.
271000	273000	The rose is great.
273000	274000	Love the rose.
274000	275000	Fantastic.
275000	277000	Now, the hammer and sickle.
277000	279000	We're gonna need to get rid of that.
279000	281000	I'm just wearing it ironically.
281000	282000	Now, don't you start with that.
282000	284000	It makes me think of red lines and gulags,
284000	285000	and it needs to go.
285000	287000	Well, maybe you're right.
287000	288000	Fine, I'll get rid of it.
288000	290000	See, I can think about optics.
290000	291000	What's that in your bag?
291000	292000	Oh, this?
292000	293000	Yeah.
293000	294000	We're gonna need to do something about that too.
294000	295000	Now, hold on.
295000	297000	Getting rid of the hammer and sickle is one thing,
297000	299000	but Marx is a foundational thinker
299000	301000	in the history of progressive political...
301000	303000	I'm not talking about getting rid of Marx.
303000	305000	I'm talking about giving him a makeover.
305000	307000	I mean, just look at the cover of that thing.
307000	309000	It's making me depressed just looking at it.
309000	310000	Red and gold?
310000	312000	What is this foreign shit?
312000	314000	Like a Chinese or a Soviet flag?
314000	316000	It's un-American.
316000	317000	I don't trust it.
317000	319000	I don't like the cut of its jib.
319000	320000	So you want a Marx Angles reader
320000	322000	wrapped in an American flag.
322000	323000	Oh, I can do you better than that.
323000	326000	Let's start with a gradient.
326000	327000	Add a grid.
327000	328000	Maybe a wave grid.
328000	330000	Let's get some shiny fonts.
330000	331000	Maybe a bust.
331000	334000	A pink bust with 3D glasses.
334000	335000	Pink glasses.
335000	337000	Maybe some palm trees.
337000	338000	Oh, yeah.
342000	343000	Or how about this?
343000	344000	Lots of brands.
344000	346000	More, more, more.
346000	347000	Oh, my God.
347000	348000	It's beautiful.
348000	350000	Okay, one more, one more.
350000	351000	A pink field.
351000	352000	Chiclet.
352000	353000	Yeah.
353000	354000	Yes, girl.
354000	355000	Yes.
355000	357000	I just realized that I actually hate you.
358000	359000	Hello, fellow whites.
359000	362000	Do you have a moment to talk about the need to secure a homeland for our people and a
362000	363000	future for white children?
363000	366000	Get the hell out of here before I smash your face, you Nazi bitch.
368000	370000	Effective, isn't it?
370000	372000	Well, I see your point.
372000	377000	But this whole Antifa thing, I can't help but wonder, from a strict PR perspective,
377000	382000	if there's some way you can not do that.
382000	384000	Are you saying we shouldn't punch Nazis?
384000	389000	I'm saying, if 30,000 people show up to counter-protest Nazis, you won't have to.
396000	400000	But that means getting 30,000 people on your side, which you're not gonna do by tweeting
400000	404000	death threats and communist propaganda and using words like dialectic and telling everyone
404000	409000	to read obscure European philosophers with unpronounceable names and unintelligible ideas
409000	414000	and smashing windows for no reason that anyone can understand or sympathize with and expecting
414000	418000	that people are gonna wanna leave their jobs and comfortable lives to join a violent revolution
418000	423000	to establish an economic system primarily associated with starvation and dictatorship.
423000	425000	Well, that's an unfair association.
425000	428000	Real communism doesn't lead to starvation and dictatorship.
428000	430000	Has there ever been real communism?
430000	431000	Well, yes.
431000	437000	Between 1910 and 1912, in revolutionary eastern Cameroon, a thriving, though short-lived,
437000	439000	communist utopia did flourish.
439000	442000	Until it was smashed by Western imperialism.
442000	443000	Right.
443000	446000	But what's the chance of that actually happening on a large scale in the near future?
446000	449000	You seem to not even care about what's actually possible.
449000	451000	That's how deep you are in pure theory.
451000	453000	And if anything is anti-Marxist, it's that.
453000	457000	You know, sometimes I think you secretly don't want your ideas to succeed.
457000	461000	You actually enjoy being a pariah whose political ideas never gain any traction.
461000	465000	Because if you have purely theoretical political beliefs, you're never accountable for the
465000	466000	way things are going.
466000	468000	I'm not saying theory is everything.
468000	469000	Only that there's no praxis.
469000	471000	Look, I'm not some kind of political scientist.
471000	473000	For all I know, you could be correct.
473000	476000	I'm just saying it's a tough sell, and you are not selling it.
476000	480000	Well, I wouldn't have to work so hard to sell it if we didn't live in a neoliberal intellectual
480000	485000	void where complacent so-called centrists with corporate backing have shifted the Overton
485000	490000	window one inch left of fascism under the heading of free speech and classical liberalism.
492000	495000	Is someone ready to bring their wares to the free marketplace of ideas?
497000	498000	Hey, hey, hey.
498000	500000	You leave centrists alone.
500000	501000	Thanks, Justine.
501000	502000	Jackie, get out of here.
502000	505000	You're embarrassing me in front of my Antifa friends.
505000	506000	I'll see you at brunch.
506000	508000	Mimosas.
508000	510000	What the hell was that?
510000	511000	Brunch?
511000	513000	You're gonna brunch with these people?
513000	515000	Well, it's more of a boozy afternoon tea.
515000	517000	Afternoon tea?
517000	522000	Does Jeeves bring around madeleine cookies and fresh-sliced lemon wedges?
522000	525000	No, but I do have a very nice Windsor China tea set.
525000	526000	Unbelievable.
526000	528000	You get the bullet, too.
528000	530000	You get the goddamn bullet, too.
530000	531000	Oh, come on.
531000	532000	Me?
532000	533000	What do you want me to do?
533000	538000	Drink victory gin out of a rusty herring tin like the anti-imperialist revolutionaries
538000	539000	in eastern Cameroon?
539000	542000	I mean, nothing is ever good enough for you people.
542000	546000	I could be munching on a cigar in the South American jungle shooting at capitalists with
546000	550000	a black beret and an eye patch, and I still wouldn't be left-wing enough for you.
550000	554000	Well, why don't you start by not going to afternoon tea with people who protect fascists
554000	555000	and not complaining about the optics?
555000	558000	I'm not complaining about the optics of people who are risking their lives to keep
558000	559000	you safe.
559000	561000	How is Antifa keeping me safe?
561000	566000	You do realize, don't you, that 99% of what Antifa does is not punching Nazis.
566000	572000	Most of what we do is behind-the-scenes organizing, infiltrating fascist groups, doxing them, disrupting
572000	576000	their recruitment, and yes, we do engage in defensive violence at fascist rallies.
576000	580000	And one of these days, if you can bear to tear yourself away from your tea set long
580000	584000	enough, you're going to be at a counter-protest and the Black Bloc is going to save your life,
584000	588000	because you don't look like you can fight, and the police certainly aren't going to save
588000	589000	you.
589000	590000	Well, maybe so.
590000	595000	I mean, I'm the first to admit, these are not Nazi-punching hands, so I'm not going
595000	599000	to get in your way, but in the free marketplace of ideas, and like it or not, that's what
599000	604000	we're in, I can't help but think that what you are matters less than what you seem to
604000	609000	be, and black-clad thugs and masks smashing things in the street seems pretty scary.
609000	613000	Oh come on, you have to admit, there's something kind of appealing about a guy in a mask.
614000	616000	What about a girl in a mask?
622000	625000	I think we should just be friends while I figure myself out.
625000	627000	Well, it was worth a shot.
627000	630000	Look, my point is, you can't just win the war in the street.
630000	632000	You also have to win the war in the heart and the mind.
632000	634000	You mean the propaganda war.
634000	635000	Shhh.
635000	637000	Don't call it propaganda.
637000	639000	There could be liberals listening.
639000	643000	Look, what the left needs to get, and what the centrists need to get, and what only I
643000	647000	and fascists seem to understand, is that reason doesn't matter very much.
647000	648000	Oh boy.
648000	649000	Here we go.
649000	651000	What is it the centrists hate about social justice warriors?
651000	654000	It's not that they don't have good reasons in support of their arguments, it's that they're
654000	656000	not cool, right?
656000	658000	Social justice warriors are not cool.
658000	659000	What do you mean?
659000	660000	They're not popular?
660000	661000	No, no, no, I mean they're not cool.
661000	663000	You can be unpopular and still cool.
663000	665000	In fact, it can be cool to be unpopular.
665000	667000	So what does it mean to be cool?
667000	671000	Cool is calm, detached, and in control of yourself, and the leading complaint about
671000	672000	social justice warriors is that they're not cool.
672000	678000	The social justice warriors who everyone cringes at online are people who I'm sure are nice
678000	682000	people, but who are having a bad moment, and they're caught on camera in the middle of
682000	683000	an outburst.
683000	684000	They're out of control.
684000	685000	And that's the problem.
685000	686000	It's not cool.
686000	687000	Luck.
687000	692000	This detached, ironic, pretend-not-to-give-a-shit posturing that white men mistake for rationality
692000	697000	is really just the self-celebration of comfortable, privileged people with nothing at stake.
697000	701000	People on the left are never going to be cool because anger and emotion are rational responses
701000	702000	to injustice.
702000	703000	I thought you'd say that.
703000	708000	But what you're failing to consider is that it's possible to be both angry and cool.
708000	712000	And what do you get when you sprinkle a little anger into a glass of cool?
712000	713000	What?
713000	716000	You get ice cold.
722000	723000	I'm sorry, what?
723000	725000	And that's what we on the left need to become.
725000	727000	Ice cold motherfuckers.
727000	729000	What the hell are you talking about?
729000	730000	Miles Davis.
730000	732000	Incredibly cool.
732000	734000	But pretty angry.
734000	736000	Did not take shit from white people.
736000	738000	But also, ice cold motherfucker.
738000	742000	So your plan is to win over centrists by becoming an ice cold motherfucker.
742000	743000	Precisely.
743000	746000	What we need is social justice, drugs, and rock and roll.
746000	747000	This is ridiculous.
747000	751000	And I suppose you think this is ridiculous.
751000	753000	I think it's stalemate.
753000	754000	No it's not.
754000	757000	My queen is wide open.
757000	758000	No it isn't.
758000	759000	Take me.
759000	761000	I'm gonna get going now.
761000	762000	Wait, where are you going?
762000	764000	I'm gonna go bash the fash.
764000	766000	Well, be careful.
766000	767000	Sure.
767000	769000	Enjoy your tea tomorrow.
772000	774000	What a goddamn lunatic.
774000	776000	I'm gonna miss her.
789000	807000	You gotta move him off the ice.
807000	809000	I'm going.
809000	810000	Good luck.
810000	811000	See ya.
811000	812000	Go.
812000	813000	Yeah.
813000	814000	See ya.
814000	815000	See ya.
815000	816000	You.
816000	817000	Yeah.
817000	830420	Whatever happened to Bruce and Trixie?
830560	832300	They got into a fight on Skype, remember?
832780	833940	Anyway, they killed each other.
834020	834760	They're both dead.
835080	837420	They kind of fired guns off in random directions.
838000	839900	It's best not to think about it too much.
