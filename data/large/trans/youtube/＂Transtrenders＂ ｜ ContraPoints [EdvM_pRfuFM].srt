00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,560
Comfort ye, comfort ye, my subscribers, so saith your goddess, for it is I, the digital messiah, the online oracle, the social media savior, yea, verily I say unto you, there are influencers abiding in the feed, keeping watch over their followers by night.

2
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,220
And lo, I came upon them, and the glory of my posts shone about me, and I delivered unto them a vision.

3
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:45,820
Freedom, freedom, fucking freedom.

4
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:52,760
Which matters more, the freedom to live an authentic life, or the freedom to crush degenerates under the heel of a jackboot?

5
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,540
As a centrist, I am unbiased.

6
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:58,080
Undecided, but the important thing is we are talking about it.

7
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:05,560
Hi, I'm Jackie Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, the political talk show where we discuss important issues like Mexicans.

8
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,980
How dangerous are they?

9
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,240
Muslims, can we stop them?

10
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:17,760
Tonight we return, once again, to the dangerous transgender trend that is turning your children into all manner of half-and-halfs and in-betweens.

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,780
I mean, look at this, they're transing 13-year-olds now, what's next, babies with breast implants?

12
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,780
It makes me want to throw up.

13
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:30,580
I live in constant fear, and fear is what freedom is all about.

14
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,160
Cut the music!

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,900
Tonight, my first guest is Tiffany Tumbles, transgender makeup vlogger and conservative opinion-haver.

16
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,900
And my second guest...

17
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:46,960
Well, what the hell are you? You're transgender, you're a man, you're a woman, you're an attack helicopter, what's your deal?

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,120
Well, Jackie Jackson, my, as you say, deal, is I don't like society.

19
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Forcing me into tiny little boxes.

20
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,120
Okay, but are you a man or a woman? Just tell me.

21
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,120
Well, why does it matter? Why do you have to know?

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:11,120
Maybe you should examine why it is you feel the need to fit everyone you meet into these little categories, Jackie Jackson.

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:17,120
Well, can I at least ask your name, or is that now considered cisgender imperialism?

24
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,120
My name is Baltimore.

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,620
Baltimore what?

26
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,620
Baltimore, Maryland.

27
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,120
I'm sorry, your name is Baltimore, Maryland?

28
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,120
It is among my names.

29
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,120
Tiffany, what do you make of this?

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
Look, Jackie, I'm going to be completely real with you.

31
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,120
I am a transsexual.

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,120
That means I have a very specific mental disorder called gender dysphoria.

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,120
I was born a boy, but I have a female brain because of a hormone imbalance in the womb.

34
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:52,120
This is a real psychiatric disorder that is verified by science and requires hormones and surgery for treatment or else I literally cannot function.

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,120
It is not a fashion statement.

36
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
It is not a trend.

37
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
It is not an easy way to feel special and oppressed.

38
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,120
It is a very difficult condition to live with.

39
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
I'm dying inside.

40
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Okay, so you're both transsexuals then.

41
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,120
No, I am a transsexual.

42
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
That is not a transsexual.

43
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,120
That is a trans-trender.

44
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,120
Trans-trender? What is that? Is that a gender?

45
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
No, it's not a gender.

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,120
A trans-trender is a person like Baltimore over here,

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:30,120
who puts on a dress and puts glitter on his beard and goes around telling people he's transgender and complaining about misgendering for oppression points.

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,120
Actually, it's they.

49
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,120
What?

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,120
I use they-them pronouns.

51
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,120
They go around collecting oppression points, as you can see.

52
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Why do you say that, Tiffany Tumbles?

53
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,120
Have I complained about oppression so far?

54
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,120
It seems to me that it is you who has been complaining about your dysphoria.

55
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
Isn't it you?

56
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,120
Is it you who is collecting oppression points, Tiffany Tumbles?

57
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,120
No, I'm not saying I'm oppressed.

58
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm saying I have dysphoria, which is not society's fault.

59
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,120
It's in my brain.

60
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,120
I was diagnosed.

61
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,120
It's a fact.

62
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,120
It's real.

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,120
My pain is real.

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,120
And my pain isn't real?

65
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:13,120
It's interesting that you think that.

66
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,120
Well, what pain are you talking about?

67
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,120
People making fun of you because you dress like a circus act?

68
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,120
Interesting that you mentioned the circus.

69
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:28,120
Tiffany Tumbles, don't you think we should examine why society confines gender-variant people to the circus?

70
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,120
You're not confined anywhere.

71
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:32,120
You choose to dress like that.

72
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,120
And why do you choose to dress the way you dress?

73
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,120
Because I'm a woman, so I'm dressed like a woman.

74
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Hello.

75
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,120
And I'm non-binary, so I dress non-conforming.

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,120
Why should I conceal who I am just to appease small-minded people?

77
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Well, it's a free country.

78
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,120
If you want to be a glitterbeard genderfuck, then go ahead.

79
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,120
But don't go around telling people that you're transgender because it makes us all look like a bunch of trendy freaks.

80
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,120
But aren't we all freaks in the eyes of society?

81
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,120
Do you think you can purchase acceptance through conformity?

82
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,120
Because that is not freedom, Tiffany Tumbles.

83
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,120
That is simply adding another cell to the prison.

84
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
It's not about conforming.

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
It's about me having an actual medical condition.

86
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,120
You do not have a female brain.

87
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,120
You have a fashion disaster.

88
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Oh, do they?

89
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,120
Well, tell me, Tiffany Tumbles.

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,120
When the doctor prescribed your hormones, did he take a look at your brain then?

91
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
What?

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,120
Of course not.

93
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,120
But you have seen a scan of your brain, yes?

94
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Well, no.

95
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Where are you going with this?

96
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,120
I mean, if you've never seen your brain,

97
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:50,120
and the doctor who diagnosed your gender dysphoria didn't look at it,

98
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
then tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

99
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,120
how do you know that you have a female brain?

100
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,120
Bullshit.

101
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,120
That's a good point.

102
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,120
No, it isn't.

103
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Look, there's scientific studies that—

104
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Can you explain to me the difference between a male brain and a female brain?

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
Are they different colors?

106
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,120
I'm not an expert.

107
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
I'm not an expert.

108
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:19,120
But there's science showing that men and women have brain differences.

109
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
I see.

110
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
But your doctor never looked at your brain.

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
So how did he know that you have gender dysphoria?

112
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,120
Well, he asked me questions and I told him about it.

113
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,120
And you told him what exactly?

114
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
That I experience gender dysphoria.

115
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,120
So would you agree then that your gender dysphoria,

116
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
and therefore your identity,

117
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,120
is valid not because of any observed factors,

118
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,120
not because of any observed facts about your brain,

119
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:53,120
but because of your feelings?

120
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,120
Well, congratulations, Attorney Frankenfurter.

121
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,120
You backed me into a corner.

122
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,120
Sure, it's because of my feelings.

123
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
My feelings of gender dysphoria.

124
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,120
So tell me, Tiffany Tumbles,

125
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,120
why is it that your feelings about your gender are valid,

126
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,120
but mine, according to you, are not?

127
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,120
This burgeoning brick.

128
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
You guys, let's think about this.

129
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,120
If I have never seen my brain,

130
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
how do I know I even have a brain?

131
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Well, you probably don't, girl.

132
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,120
Look, Baltimore, I'm sure you have lots of feelings about your gender.

133
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,120
And if you feel cloud gender or demi-nebula or astroglide

134
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,120
or whatever Tumblr bullshit passes through your mind,

135
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
then you do you, girl.

136
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,120
Or, not girl, whatever the fuck you are.

137
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,120
But I want to make one thing very clear.

138
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:48,120
I am nothing like you, okay?

139
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,120
My gender is not unicorns and glitter.

140
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,120
My gender is a serious psychiatric diagnosis

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
that I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy.

142
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,120
No, not even you.

143
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,120
My, I'm really getting under your skin, aren't I?

144
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,120
No.

145
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,120
Well, actually, yes, to be honest, you are.

146
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,120
You're getting under my skin because it really rattles my dysphoria

147
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:11,120
that you're sitting here claiming to represent the transgender community,

148
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,120
when in fact, you're just making a mockery of my pain.

149
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,120
Your pain?

150
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,120
You're in a lot of pain, aren't you, Tiffany Tumbles?

151
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
Well, I can sense the vibrations of your pain across the room.

152
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,120
And I pity you, Tiffany Tumbles.

153
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,120
I pity you because you don't think you're real

154
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,120
until a man in a lab coat signs a prescription pad.

155
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,120
And I can't imagine what it must be like

156
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,120
to have so little confidence

157
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
in your own reality.

158
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Okay, well, don't patronize me.

159
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,120
I'm just trying to understand, Tiffany Tumbles,

160
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,120
why you think being transgender is all about hating yourself

161
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,120
and hating your body.

162
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,120
Why can't trans identity be joyful and celebratory?

163
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,120
No, you don't have to hate yourself or hate your body,

164
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,120
but you do have to have dysphoria.

165
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,120
And if you tell people otherwise, you're just misleading them.

166
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,120
I want to heal the rift inside your heart, Tiffany Tumbles.

167
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,120
Would you please join me

168
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
in saying a prayer for your wellness?

169
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
Actually, I would strongly prefer

170
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
if you would stay away from any of my rifts.

171
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,120
Oh, goddess of light,

172
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
please shield and protect Tiffany

173
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
against the ravages of inner strife.

174
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,120
Enclose her in your loving arms

175
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,120
and cleanse her of all condemnation

176
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,120
and internalized transphobia.

177
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
I entreat you, oh great mother,

178
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,120
bathe Tiffany in inner peace, acceptance, and self-care,

179
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,120
and rid her of her toxic,

180
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,120
disnormative, true scum ways.

181
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
Amen.

182
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
Are we done here?

183
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,120
I don't think I can make it through any more readings

184
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,120
from the SJW prayer book.

185
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,120
Tiffany, why are you rejecting the love

186
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,120
I am trying to deliver unto you?

187
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,120
Because I'm grossed out by you.

188
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
That's why.

189
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,120
Okay, then.

190
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,120
Well, namaste, bitch.

191
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,120
Look, why don't we all take a step back

192
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,120
and take a moment just to honor our heroes in uniform

193
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
and let them know how much we appreciate their service.

194
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
God, I love the troops.

195
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,120
Thinking about the troops makes me wet.

196
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,120
It makes me cum.

197
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,120
Semper fi, boys.

198
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,120
What?

199
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,120
I think I'm starting to wrap my head around this.

200
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,120
Tiffany, your transsexualism,

201
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,120
I have to say I don't love it,

202
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,120
but you do seem to at least be aware

203
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,120
that you have some kind of mental disorder,

204
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,120
so I'll give you that.

205
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,120
Whereas, Baltimore, you're what?

206
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
Making some kind of statement?

207
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,120
If my existence is a statement,

208
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,120
I think that says more about society

209
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,120
than it says about me.

210
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,120
Jackie, what you have to understand

211
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,120
is there have been transsexuals around for a long time.

212
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,120
I have talked to 80-year-old transsexuals,

213
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,120
and they agree with me

214
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
that all this genderqueer bullshit,

215
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:54,120
it's just a trend.

216
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
It's a fad.

217
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,120
But is it?

218
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
For thousands of years,

219
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,120
there have been third-gender groups

220
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,120
across human cultures.

221
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,120
There's the Hydra of India,

222
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,120
the two-spirit people among Native Americans.

223
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Whereas, binary transsexualism

224
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,120
is a medical construct of the 20th century.

225
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,120
Gender dysphoria wasn't even a recognized medical condition

226
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,120
until 2013,

227
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,120
meaning that Tumblr is twice as old

228
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:23,120
as the first gender dysphoria diagnosis.

229
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,120
So perhaps it is you, Tiffany Tumbles,

230
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,120
and not I who is following a trend.

231
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Wow, that just blew my mind.

232
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,120
The tables are turned, bitch.

233
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,120
Tiffany, could you explain to me

234
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,120
why you decided to become a trans-trender?

235
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,120
He's not Native American, though.

236
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
They.

237
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
They.

238
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
You know, it's kinda hard not to call you he

239
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,120
when you have a fucking beard.

240
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
If you were actually trans

241
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
and you actually had dysphoria,

242
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,120
then you wouldn't be comfortable with that.

243
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,120
Your Honor, in my defense,

244
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
it is a glitter beard.

245
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,120
Okay.

246
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Well, that's very 2019,

247
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,120
very gender, very they,

248
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,120
but what it isn't is two-spirit.

249
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,120
Look, the SJWs don't even agree with this.

250
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,120
They think it's racist.

251
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,120
White people have two genders.

252
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,120
Pick one and sit down, dude.

253
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
Yeah, that's a good point.

254
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,120
Two genders.

255
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,120
Two genders.

256
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,120
Attack helicopter.

257
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
It's ma'am.

258
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Okay.

259
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,120
Attack helicopter.

260
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Two genders.

261
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,120
Only two genders.

262
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
How many genders?

263
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Two.

264
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Attack helicopter.

265
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,120
It's ma'am.

266
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Two genders.

267
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,120
Two genders.

268
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,120
Two genders.

269
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
You're just saying that you're me

270
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,120
and talking in a whiny voice.

271
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,120
That is not an argument.

272
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,120
The toxic truce gumbolias are gatekeeping my gender.

273
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,120
I don't have dysphoria,

274
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
but for some reason,

275
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
I still have access to doctors

276
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
like a transition

277
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
from a man to a man.

278
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,120
The one thing you'll always have to deal with in life

279
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,120
is assholes.

280
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,120
Oh, but how dare you misgender me?

281
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
It's hard to be yourself,

282
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,120
but it's worth it.

283
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,120
How dare you not know that I use they,

284
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,120
then I don't,

285
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,120
even though no one ever sees that.

286
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,120
Let's be ourselves.

287
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,120
Let's totally be ourselves.

288
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,120
All right.

289
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,120
That's enough of this.

290
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,120
You know,

291
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,120
as a biological female,

292
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,120
I honestly don't understand any of this

293
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,120
shitty shit.

294
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,120
Okay.

295
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,120
That was a hard T.

296
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
Now, does my husband sometimes wear panties around the house

297
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,120
and ask me to call him mommy's little slut?

298
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Well, sure,

299
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,120
but that is a matter between her and the Lord.

300
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
Let's best not think about it too much.

301
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Anyway, Tiffany,

302
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
my brain has an easier time processing you

303
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,120
than whatever is going on over here,

304
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,120
so congratulations.

305
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,120
You're the winner.

306
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,120
That was some excellent free speech.

307
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,120
Okay.

308
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,120
Great.

309
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
So, in conclusion,

310
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,120
trans-trenders are real

311
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
and probably dangerous.

312
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
Make sure to protect your children.

313
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Bye.

314
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,120
As for how many genders there are,

315
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
you know,

316
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
I'm going to take the centrist route

317
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,120
and say two and a half.

318
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,120
All right.

319
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,120
That's our show.

320
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
This has been the Freedom Report

321
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,120
where the debate never stops.

322
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,120
Except when the show is over.

323
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,120
Get out.

324
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,120
The girl can't help it.

325
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,120
She's a Libra.

326
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,120
Behold,

327
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,120
the non-binary lamb

328
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,120
who is despised and rejected.

329
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,120
They gave their cheek

330
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,120
to them that mocked their beard

331
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,120
and hid not their face from shame.

332
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,120
But lo,

333
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Tiffany,

334
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,120
the person who tricks

335
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
trendier than thou,

336
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,120
a shady queen,

337
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,120
came next upon her friend Justine

338
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,120
and sought her counsel thus.

339
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,120
God damn it, Justine.

340
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,120
I just can't

341
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,120
with these trenders anymore.

342
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
I simply cannot.

343
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,120
You know,

344
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:39,120
you can just text me here

345
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
and I'll come open the door.

346
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,120
Okay.

347
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Seems a little formal.

348
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,120
Ugh.

349
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,120
You look great, hon.

350
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
Cute.

351
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
Justine,

352
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,120
you look like absolute shit.

353
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
What happened?

354
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Did the cat girl

355
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,120
finally beat you up?

356
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
No.

357
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:55,120
I...

358
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,120
Justine, look,

359
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,120
I slept in my makeup, okay?

360
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Leave me alone.

361
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
I've been having a difficult time.

362
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,120
Were we serving

363
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,120
a little depression moment?

364
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
Jesus.

365
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Well,

366
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,120
don't leave me out.

367
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,120
I saw you

368
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,120
on the Freedom Report today.

369
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,120
Okay, girl,

370
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,120
can we talk about

371
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,120
Ladybeard, Baltimore, Maryland?

372
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,120
Ugh.

373
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
Add that one

374
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,120
to the crazy

375
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,120
tranny hall of fame.

376
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Really?

377
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
You're happy

378
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,120
with the way that went?

379
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,120
You feel good about that?

380
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,120
You feel good

381
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,120
about yourself right now?

382
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,120
Well,

383
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,120
why wouldn't I?

384
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,120
Tiffany,

385
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,120
there is nothing

386
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,120
more sad

387
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,120
and pathetic

388
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
and desperate

389
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,120
and low in this world

390
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,120
than a tran

391
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
who thinks

392
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,120
she's better

393
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,120
than other trans.

394
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
It's like a drunk

395
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,120
feeling superior

396
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,120
to a junkie.

397
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,120
You seem to think

398
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
that you're queen

399
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
of the world

400
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
because you're hanging on

401
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,120
to societal acceptance

402
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
by two fingers

403
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,120
instead of one.

404
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,120
Well,

405
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
you're not, bitch.

406
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
You're just an insecure,

407
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,120
frightened little queer

408
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,120
who's determined

409
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,120
to use the one ounce

410
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,120
of power you have

411
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,120
to tread

412
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,120
other people down.

413
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,120
And if I'm being honest,

414
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,120
I don't find

415
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,120
that very admirable.

416
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,120
Your eyelash

417
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,120
is coming unglued.

418
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,120
Ugh.

419
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,120
My life is coming unglued.

420
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
Ugh.

421
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,120
Look,

422
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,120
it's not like I'm coming

423
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,120
after trannies

424
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,120
who just can't afford

425
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,120
to transition

426
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,120
or don't have

427
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,120
the social support.

428
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,120
It's not like Baltimore

429
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,120
is doing everything

430
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,120
he can to pass

431
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
and people just treat him

432
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,120
like a freak

433
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,120
for no reason.

434
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,120
They.

435
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,120
It's they.

436
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,120
Are we really saying

437
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,120
they now?

438
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
In private?

439
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,120
Yes,

440
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
we are.

441
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,120
So get used to it.

442
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,120
My name is Justine.

443
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,120
I think misgendering

444
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,120
is toxic

445
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
because I care

446
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,120
about people's feelings.

447
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
Ugh.

448
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,120
I always forget

449
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,120
that you're like

450
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,120
actually an SJW.

451
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,120
I always forget

452
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,120
that you're actually

453
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,120
an asshole.

454
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,120
Why do I even hang out

455
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,120
with you?

456
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,120
Oh,

457
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,120
because you hate yourself

458
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,120
and you have to believe

459
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,120
there's hope for me

460
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,120
because if there's hope

461
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,120
for me,

462
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,120
there might be hope

463
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
for you.

464
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,120
Wow,

465
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,120
you're developing

466
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,120
self-consciousness.

467
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,120
Where'd you learn

468
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,120
that trick?

469
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,120
Gigi?

470
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,120
Tiffany,

471
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,120
have you ever

472
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,120
been bullied?

473
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,120
Oh,

474
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,120
let's see.

475
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
You don't see me

476
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
going on talk shows

477
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
to play the victim.

478
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
No,

479
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,120
I see you going

480
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,120
on talk shows

481
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,120
to play the bully.

482
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,120
I think you grew up

483
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
getting bullied

484
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
for being a sissy

485
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
till you started passing

486
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:09,120
as a woman

487
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,120
and then you got

488
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
a little taste of normal

489
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,120
and now you want

490
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,120
to be the one

491
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
who bashes the queers.

492
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,120
Bash them?

493
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,120
If anything,

494
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,120
I'm the one

495
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:18,120
defending trans people

496
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,120
from appropriation

497
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,120
and misrepresentation

498
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
by these trenders.

499
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,120
You said on air

500
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,120
that Baltimore

501
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:24,120
grosses you out.

502
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
Do you really

503
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,120
expect me to believe

504
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,120
that you have

505
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,120
anything to do

506
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,120
with your own

507
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
self-loathing?

508
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,120
How could it be

509
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,120
self-loathing

510
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,120
when Baltimore

511
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
is nothing

512
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
like me?

513
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Okay,

514
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,120
then it's just bigotry.

515
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,120
That's even worse.

516
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,120
Oh,

517
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
it's not bigotry.

518
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
Look,

519
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,120
I shouldn't have said

520
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,120
grossed out,

521
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,120
I'll give you that,

522
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,120
but he does,

523
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,120
they do

524
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
make me uncomfortable.

525
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
And why do you

526
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,120
think that is?

527
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
Ugh,

528
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,120
I got secondhand dysphoria

529
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,120
looking at someone

530
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
so burgeoning.

531
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,120
Ugh,

532
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
it makes me want

533
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,120
to down a bottle

534
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,120
of whiskey

535
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,120
and you just

536
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
clock everything

537
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,120
and you feel like

538
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,120
sympathetic

539
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
vibrations

540
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
of dysphoria.

541
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,120
Yeah,

542
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
I do know

543
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,120
what you're talking about

544
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
and I'll tell you

545
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
why it happens.

546
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,120
When you're early

547
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,120
in your transition

548
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
and you're doing

549
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,120
everything you can

550
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
to pass,

551
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,120
you develop

552
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
a really sophisticated eye

553
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,120
for every little thing

554
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,120
that makes you clockable.

555
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,120
Then,

556
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,120
you turn that

557
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,120
sophisticated eye

558
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,120
onto other

559
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,120
trans people

560
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,120
and you project

561
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
your dysphoria

562
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,120
onto them.

563
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
I buy that.

564
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,120
This is

565
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,120
other trans people's

566
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
presentation.

567
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
Secondhand dysphoria

568
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
is not valid.

569
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
The fact that

570
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
you project

571
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
your dysphoria

572
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,120
onto other people

573
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,120
is your problem

574
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,120
and your problem alone.

575
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,120
And you need to deal

576
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
with that issue

577
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,120
in private,

578
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
girl,

579
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
not on a fucking

580
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
talk show.

581
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,120
Yeah,

582
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,120
you're probably

583
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,120
right about that.

584
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,120
But it still

585
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,120
doesn't make

586
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,120
Baltimore,

587
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,120
Maryland

588
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,120
any more valid.

589
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,120
Tiffany,

590
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,120
let's be pragmatic

591
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,120
about this.

592
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Suppose everything

593
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,120
you do

594
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
is for the

595
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
sake

596
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
of

597
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
transsexuals.

598
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,120
Every time

599
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,120
you say the word

600
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
transsexual,

601
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
I feel like

602
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,120
it's 1978.

603
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Are you 80 years old?

604
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
I guess you could say

605
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
I'm not the trendiest person.

606
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Haha.

607
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,120
Look,

608
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
suppose you're right

609
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
and everyone

610
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
who doesn't meet

611
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
your definition

612
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,120
of a transsexual

613
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
is some kind of

614
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,120
confused trend follower.

615
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,120
Even if that were true,

616
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
and to be clear,

617
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
it isn't,

618
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,120
what you're doing

619
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,120
harms

620
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
even the trans people

621
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,120
you think are valid

622
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,120
about their gender

623
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
and of having

624
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,120
non-conforming expression

625
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
and you're going around

626
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,120
enforcing a stigma

627
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
against that.

628
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,120
Didn't you ever

629
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
have doubts

630
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
about your gender?

631
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Weren't you ever

632
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,120
androgynous?

633
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,120
Oh yeah,

634
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
I mean,

635
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
I was never

636
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
that burgeoning,

637
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,120
but I had my little

638
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
cringe here

639
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
being a non-binary

640
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
SJW.

641
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Uh huh.

642
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
And one of the great

643
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,120
things about

644
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
non-binary identities

645
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
is they give

646
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
trans people

647
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,120
the conceptual

648
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
space to exist

649
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
even when

650
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,120
neither gender

651
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,120
confuses them.

652
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,120
Has it occurred to you

653
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,120
that being shamed

654
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
and berated

655
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
for being a trender

656
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
during your

657
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
exploration year

658
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
might not have been

659
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
the most helpful thing?

660
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,120
Not really.

661
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,120
I have dysphoria

662
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,120
so if anyone

663
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
called me a trender

664
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:07,120
I'd eventually

665
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
prove them wrong.

666
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
That's all I'm saying.

667
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
If you're not a trender,

668
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
then transition.

669
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,120
Prove me wrong.

670
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,120
The stigma

671
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,120
you perpetuate

672
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,120
against gender confusion

673
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,120
and experimentation

674
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,120
keeps trans people

675
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,120
in the closet

676
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,120
and delays transition.

677
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
It alienates

678
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
baby trans

679
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,120
from the community

680
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
instead of publicly

681
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
humiliating them.

682
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
And when you

683
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
appoint yourself

684
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:27,120
the public decider

685
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
of whomst is

686
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,120
really trans,

687
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,120
the Torquemada

688
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
of the trender

689
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,120
inquisition,

690
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,120
you're terrorizing

691
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,120
a lot of people

692
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,120
who are genuinely

693
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,120
trying to figure

694
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,120
themselves out.

695
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
Okay.

696
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
But then

697
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
how do we decide

698
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,120
which trendies

699
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
are valid?

700
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
We don't.

701
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Then this is

702
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,120
where I'm losing you.

703
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,120
Because trans trenders

704
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,120
are absolutely a thing.

705
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,120
Like, undeniably.

706
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,120
I've talked to people

707
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
who've literally told me

708
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
they used to be

709
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
trans trenders.

710
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:53,120
Some people

711
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,120
question their gender

712
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,120
but end up deciding

713
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,120
they're not really trans.

714
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
There is nothing

715
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,120
wrong with that.

716
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,120
And those people

717
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,120
still aren't being helped

718
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
by public shaming.

719
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Well, maybe they wouldn't

720
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
be confused in the first place

721
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
if SJWs weren't

722
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
going around

723
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,120
telling people

724
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
they don't need dysphoria

725
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,120
to be trans.

726
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
You know,

727
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,120
it's one thing

728
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
if teenage girls

729
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,120
want to dye their hair pink

730
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
and call themselves

731
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
Demi Boys

732
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
for most of sophomore year.

733
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
But some of these kids

734
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
are actually gonna

735
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,120
medically transition.

736
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,120
And soon,

737
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
we're gonna have

738
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
an epidemic

739
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
of detransitioners

740
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
who told you so

741
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
op-eds

742
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
in every major newspaper.

743
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,120
Now, maybe you think

744
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,120
that's worth it

745
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
just to make sure

746
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
no one ever feels

747
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
invalidated

748
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
for any reason.

749
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
But I think

750
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,120
that's highly irresponsible.

751
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,120
Look,

752
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
if you're so worried

753
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
about people

754
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,120
feeling pressured

755
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
to medically transition,

756
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,120
then what you should be doing

757
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,120
is working to make

758
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
the trans community

759
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
as inclusive

760
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,120
and welcoming

761
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,120
as possible

762
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,120
to gender non-conforming people

763
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
and non-binary people

764
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
and people

765
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
who are questioning

766
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
and trans people

767
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
who don't medically transition.

768
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,120
But instead,

769
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
you're doing

770
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,120
the exact opposite.

771
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,120
You're telling everyone

772
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,120
that medical transition

773
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
is the only way

774
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
to be valid.

775
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
And if anything

776
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,120
is pressuring people

777
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
to medically transition,

778
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,120
it's that.

779
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
Justine,

780
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:03,120
I think

781
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,120
you're a good person.

782
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,120
Maybe too good.

783
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,120
And that's why

784
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
you're trying

785
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
to have compassion

786
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
for everyone.

787
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
But at some point,

788
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,120
you have to protect yourself.

789
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,120
We live in a world

790
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,120
of Jackie Jacksons

791
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
who don't understand

792
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
trans people

793
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
and don't think

794
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,120
we're real.

795
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,120
So we need to have

796
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
an explanation

797
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,120
of what it is

798
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,120
to be trans

799
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
and not feelings.

800
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
And the most factual

801
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,120
explanation

802
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
is transmedicalism,

803
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
which is the idea

804
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
that transsexualism

805
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,120
is a diagnosable

806
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
mental disorder

807
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
called gender dysphoria.

808
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,120
There's science

809
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,120
to back this up.

810
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
It's accepted

811
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
by medical professionals

812
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
and it clearly explains

813
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,120
why we are valid

814
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
unlike Rachel Dolezal

815
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,120
and snowflake

816
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,120
gender teenagers

817
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
and people

818
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,120
who identify

819
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
as cats.

820
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
Okay,

821
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
I see the appeal

822
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,120
but I don't think

823
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,120
transmedicalism

824
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,120
is as validating

825
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
as you think it is.

826
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,120
Why not?

827
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
Apparently.

828
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Why does having

829
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,120
gender dysphoria

830
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,120
make you a woman?

831
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,120
Because gender dysphoria

832
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,120
means I have

833
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,120
a female brain.

834
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,120
No it doesn't.

835
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,120
I'm sorry to tell you

836
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
but the science

837
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,120
does not say

838
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,120
what you think it says.

839
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
There may be neurological

840
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
causes of gender dysphoria

841
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,120
but at the end

842
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,120
of the day

843
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,120
all dysphoria is

844
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,120
is discomfort

845
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
in a male body

846
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
or a male social role

847
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
or however you want

848
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
to put it.

849
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,120
And wanting

850
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
to be a woman

851
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
is not the same thing

852
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,120
as being a woman.

853
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,120
Not by any means.

854
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Girl, where are you

855
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
going with this?

856
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
What is this?

857
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
Are you becoming

858
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,120
a TERF?

859
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,120
No, I just don't think

860
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
your theory actually validates

861
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,120
our womanhood.

862
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,120
Well if you're right

863
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:29,120
that's a real problem

864
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,120
because we need

865
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
to have reason

866
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,120
and science

867
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,120
and logic

868
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
and facts

869
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
on our side

870
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
so that we can explain

871
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
to society

872
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
that we are valid

873
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
and that we are real

874
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
otherwise

875
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,120
bad things.

876
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Well maybe there's

877
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
a better theory.

878
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Well okay Socrates

879
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
let's hear it then.

880
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
The way I see it

881
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
gender is either

882
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,120
psychological

883
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,120
or biological

884
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
or social.

885
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,120
Now my friend Tabby

886
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,120
the cat girl

887
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
she thinks it's

888
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
all psychological

889
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
that it's just

890
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,120
identity

891
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
that whatever you think

892
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
about your own gender

893
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
is true.

894
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,120
And that makes me

895
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,120
really uncomfortable

896
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
because then

897
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,120
what's the difference

898
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
between identifying

899
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
as a woman

900
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
and identifying

901
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
as a Norwegian forest cat?

902
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,120
It's a difference

903
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,120
that Tabby herself

904
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
seems not to have

905
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
much of a grip on.

906
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,120
Girl that's literally

907
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
what I've been trying

908
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,120
to tell you about

909
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,120
trans-trenders

910
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,120
this entire time.

911
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,120
Just let me finish.

912
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
If gender is strictly

913
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
biological

914
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
it doesn't influence people

915
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
unless you make

916
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
some kind of

917
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
wrong brain

918
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
and the wrong body argument

919
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
but I told you

920
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,120
I'm not buying that.

921
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
So that leaves

922
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
gender as a social construct.

923
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Are you going to try

924
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,120
to make me read

925
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
Judith Butler again?

926
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,120
I'll summarize it.

927
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
Gender is a series

928
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
of gestures.

929
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,120
It's called performativity.

930
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,120
It's the way you dress.

931
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,120
It's the way you speak.

932
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,120
It's the way you act.

933
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,120
It's the way you relate

934
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,120
to other people.

935
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Through transitioning

936
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
we habituate

937
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
to the gestures

938
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:44,120
of womanhood

939
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
and socially

940
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,120
that makes us women

941
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
regardless of

942
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,120
biology or psychology

943
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
checkmate

944
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,120
or transphobe.

945
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,120
Okay.

946
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,120
The problem with that

947
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
is that it's both

948
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,120
too exclusionary

949
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
and too inclusive.

950
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,120
It excludes

951
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
a lot of trans people

952
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
who can't transition

953
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
for circumstantial reasons

954
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,120
but whose dysphoria

955
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,120
is very real.

956
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,120
And it includes

957
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,120
every trans-trender

958
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,120
drag queen

959
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,120
fetishist

960
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
and two-bit

961
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
cross-dressing comedian

962
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,120
in a dine-out wig.

963
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
Well,

964
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
do you really believe

965
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,120
that a man who plays

966
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
a woman on stage

967
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,120
becomes just as much

968
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,120
of a woman

969
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,120
as you and me?

970
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,120
Uh,

971
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,120
yes?

972
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Bitch,

973
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,120
no you don't.

974
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Yeah,

975
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
you're right.

976
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,120
I'm full of shit.

977
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
I know you are

978
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
because you're an SJW

979
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,120
and SJWs hate

980
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
performativity theory

981
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,120
almost as much

982
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
as they hate me.

983
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,120
Well,

984
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
they only hate it

985
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
because they don't understand it.

986
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,120
They think it invalidates

987
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,120
non-binary identities

988
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
but in fact

989
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,120
it's the most rational way

990
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,120
to explain

991
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
non-binary identities.

992
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,120
How can you perform

993
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
a non-binary identity?

994
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
Simple.

995
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,120
You learn the rules

996
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
so you can break them.

997
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
Wearing a beard

998
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,120
and a dress

999
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
and the gesture

1000
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
of declaring

1001
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
I am neither a man

1002
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,120
or a woman

1003
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,120
is a speech act

1004
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
that removes the speaker

1005
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,120
from the semantics

1006
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
Girl,

1007
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
shut up.

1008
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
This is too much philosophizing.

1009
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I can't stand it anymore.

1010
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,120
Why don't you tell me

1011
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
what's really going on with you?

1012
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,120
Why do you look like

1013
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:03,120
you've been in a k-hole

1014
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,120
for a week?

1015
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
Why are you suddenly

1016
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
so obsessed

1017
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
with white knighting

1018
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
for non-binary people?

1019
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,120
Because I am non-binary.

1020
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
No you're not.

1021
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,120
What are you talking about?

1022
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,120
I just

1023
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,120
feel like

1024
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,120
since I started transitioning

1025
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:17,120
I've been trying

1026
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
so hard

1027
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,120
to fit in

1028
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,120
and to perform

1029
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
my gender

1030
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
and to pass

1031
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,120
and to just be normal.

1032
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
But I can't do it anymore.

1033
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,120
I just cannot

1034
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,120
make it work.

1035
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
I feel like an actor.

1036
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,120
I feel like a zombie.

1037
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,120
Like I'm

1038
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,120
going through

1039
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,120
the motions

1040
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,120
of this new gender role

1041
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,120
that's supposed

1042
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
to liberate me

1043
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
but that's somehow

1044
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,120
just as empty

1045
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
as the old one.

1046
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,120
Because I'm just

1047
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,120
not normal, Tiffany.

1048
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
I am a freak.

1049
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
And I'm always

1050
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
gonna be a freak.

1051
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
Justine,

1052
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
you're not non-binary.

1053
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,120
You're gay.

1054
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,120
And everyone

1055
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,120
can see this

1056
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
Oh come on.

1057
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,120
I'm not

1058
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:50,120
I'm not

1059
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:51,120
gay.

1060
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,120
Justine

1061
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
was extremely

1062
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
gay.

1063
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,120
In protest

1064
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
to the Lady May

1065
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
there simply

1066
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,120
is no stopping

1067
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
gayness.

1068
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
I love

1069
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,120
cat girls.

1070
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
I hate

1071
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
cat girls

1072
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
but I also

1073
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
love them.

1074
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,120
Oh

1075
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
abominable

1076
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,120
fate.

1077
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
Okay.

1078
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,120
So I'm a little bit

1079
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,120
gay.

1080
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,120
Right.

1081
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,120
And you don't know

1082
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,120
how to reconcile

1083
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
your gender.

1084
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
That's why you feel

1085
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
this dissonance.

1086
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,120
Yeah.

1087
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,120
I guess that's

1088
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
basically it.

1089
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,120
Well it really shouldn't

1090
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
be that hard, girl.

1091
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
You already came out

1092
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,120
as a woman.

1093
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,120
Just blurt it out.

1094
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Say,

1095
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Hello world.

1096
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
My name is Justine

1097
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
and I fuck

1098
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
pussy.

1099
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,120
That's a very

1100
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
cis-normative way to

1101
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
Say it.

1102
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,120
Hello world.

1103
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
My name is Justine

1104
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,120
and I fuck

1105
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
pussy.

1106
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,120
Ugh.

1107
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,120
I feel like a man

1108
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,120
when I say it.

1109
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,120
Yeah.

1110
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
Well you should

1111
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,120
probably buy a pickup

1112
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,120
then.

1113
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Get some of those

1114
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,120
mud flaps on the back

1115
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
with the little sexy

1116
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
ladies on them

1117
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,120
and you may as well

1118
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
change your name

1119
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
back to Justine.

1120
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
Okay.

1121
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,120
Well that's just

1122
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
uncalled for.

1123
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Girl, I don't know

1124
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
what to say except

1125
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,120
I told you so.

1126
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,120
Sexuality is just

1127
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,120
like gender identity.

1128
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
It is not a performance.

1129
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
It's not a trend.

1130
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
It's not a choice.

1131
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
It's just part of

1132
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
who you are

1133
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
and there's nothing

1134
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:09,120
you can do to change it.

1135
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
I guess you're right.

1136
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
I guess my theory

1137
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,120
sucks.

1138
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
It sucks so fucking

1139
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,120
hard.

1140
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
But the good news

1141
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
is you can unclench

1142
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
your asshole now

1143
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,120
and do whatever you

1144
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
want because you're

1145
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,120
still a woman

1146
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
whether you're

1147
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
performing a stereotype

1148
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,120
or not.

1149
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
So run free,

1150
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,120
Justine.

1151
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,120
Go top a cis woman.

1152
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,120
Bang a gay guy.

1153
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:29,120
Wear some oversized

1154
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
flannel.

1155
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,120
Do whatever you

1156
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
want.

1157
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,120
Wow.

1158
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,120
Yeah.

1159
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,120
I guess that is

1160
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,120
pretty liberating.

1161
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,120
Yeah.

1162
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
Thank God for

1163
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
transmedicalism,

1164
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
right?

1165
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,120
Oh, except not

1166
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,120
because you just

1167
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,120
destroyed transmedicalism

1168
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,120
with facts and logic

1169
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
so we have no theory.

1170
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,120
What do we do now?

1171
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
How do we prove

1172
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,120
we're valid?

1173
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,120
Well, just do what

1174
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,120
every trans woman

1175
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:51,120
has done since

1176
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
the beginning of time.

1177
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,120
Go out and fuck

1178
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
the most brutally

1179
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
heterosexual man

1180
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
you can find

1181
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
and be validated

1182
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
and come.

1183
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Oh, honey,

1184
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,120
I have and I will

1185
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
but that's not going

1186
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,120
to convince anyone

1187
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
but me.

1188
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
It's not a proof.

1189
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
It's not a theory.

1190
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
Well, maybe

1191
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,120
we don't need a theory.

1192
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,120
Maybe we don't need

1193
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
to prove anything.

1194
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,120
Bad things,

1195
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Justine.

1196
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,120
Bad things.

1197
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Do we have a theory

1198
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
about why people

1199
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
are trans?

1200
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,120
No.

1201
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,120
They just are.

1202
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
The only reason

1203
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
we even feel like

1204
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,120
we need a theory

1205
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
about trans people

1206
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
is that society

1207
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
is so unaccepting

1208
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
of us

1209
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
that it's constantly

1210
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,120
demanding we justify

1211
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
our own reality.

1212
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,120
Okay.

1213
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,120
So what am I supposed

1214
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
to tell Jackie Jackson

1215
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,120
then?

1216
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
What am I supposed

1217
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
to tell the TERFs?

1218
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,120
That I'm a woman

1219
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
because reasons?

1220
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
No.

1221
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,120
Not even because reasons.

1222
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,120
Just because you are.

1223
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,120
So it's what?

1224
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,120
A leap of faith?

1225
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Oh, great.

1226
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,120
I'm sure that's

1227
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
going to convince

1228
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
us to believe

1229
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
that we are

1230
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,120
trans.

1231
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
It makes us sound

1232
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
completely delusional.

1233
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
Well, Tiffany,

1234
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
delusion

1235
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
is what separates

1236
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
us from the animals.

1237
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
Who do you think

1238
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
built the pyramids

1239
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
and the cathedrals?

1240
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Clearly not people

1241
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
with a perfectly

1242
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
rational worldview.

1243
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,120
But what do you care anyway?

1244
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Aren't you the one

1245
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,120
who thinks being trans

1246
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,120
is a mental disorder?

1247
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
Well, I wouldn't

1248
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,120
describe it as

1249
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,120
the height of sanity,

1250
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
but I would prefer

1251
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,120
to think that my whole

1252
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
life and identity

1253
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,120
is based on something

1254
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,120
I can rationally explain.

1255
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
Well, what are we, Tiffany?

1256
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,120
Men?

1257
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Can we wrap up

1258
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,120
the entire world

1259
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
in a little

1260
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
rational box?

1261
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
Maybe the most

1262
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
important things

1263
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
in life can't

1264
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
be logically proved.

1265
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Can you logically prove

1266
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
that you love

1267
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
your own children?

1268
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
No.

1269
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
And the attempt

1270
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
to prove it

1271
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
is as degrading

1272
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
as it is futile.

1273
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
Maybe gender identity

1274
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
is one of those things.

1275
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Okay, but then

1276
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
how do I prove

1277
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I'm more valid

1278
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
than Baltimore,

1279
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
Maryland,

1280
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
and the star genders,

1281
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
and the cat people?

1282
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
Well, maybe

1283
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
we should stop

1284
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
getting so caught up

1285
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
in proving

1286
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
our validity

1287
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
to ourselves

1288
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,120
that we end up

1289
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
being horribly cruel

1290
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,120
to other people.

1291
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:47,120
What if we just

1292
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
accept all the freaks

1293
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
of the world?

1294
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
At the end of the day,

1295
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,120
maybe it's just not

1296
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,120
as important

1297
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,120
to have logical proofs

1298
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,120
as it is to be

1299
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,120
empathetic

1300
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,120
and open-minded

1301
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,120
and compassionate.

1302
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Kumbaya, my lord,

1303
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,120
kumbaya.

1304
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,120
Kumbaya, my lord,

1305
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,120
kumbaya.

1306
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,120
Tiffany.

1307
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:10,120
Kumbaya, my lord,

1308
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,120
kumbaya.

1309
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Kumbaya, my lord,

1310
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,120
kumbaya.

1311
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I have something

1312
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
to tell you.

1313
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,120
Here it comes.

1314
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
I love you.

1315
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,120
Okay.

1316
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Well, I'm going

1317
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,120
to get going now.

1318
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,120
I have an important

1319
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,120
date tonight,

1320
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,120
drinking vodka

1321
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,120
cranberries

1322
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
and reading

1323
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,120
YouTube comments

1324
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,120
by myself.

1325
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,120
So I'd really better

1326
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,120
go do that,

1327
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
but good luck

1328
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
with your new life

1329
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
as a male lesbian

1330
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,120
who fucks cats.

1331
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Ugh.

1332
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,120
I love you.

1333
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,120
I love you.

1334
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
I love you.

1335
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,120
I love you.

1336
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,120
I love you.

1337
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
I love you.

1338
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
I love you.

1339
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Oh, are you upset?

1340
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,120
She has to go.

1341
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,120
I'm sorry.

1342
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,120
I hate this bitch.

1343
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,120
But God,

1344
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,120
she's a yum yum.

1345
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,120
Hearken, children.

1346
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,120
In this vision

1347
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,120
ye have witnessed

1348
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
world fools

1349
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,120
upon the screen.

1350
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,120
Fools

1351
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,120
who do not love

1352
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,120
themselves,

1353
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,120
but otherwise

1354
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,840
I, your goddess, mother, queen, messiah, I am nothing like them.

1355
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,560
For I am truth, I am light, I am in capitalism, and everything I tweet is woke.

1356
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,800
But most importantly, I love myself.

1357
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:30,300
I love myself so much it makes me wet, it makes me cum.

1358
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:35,840
Praise be up to me, hallelujah, like, comment, and subscribe, amen.
