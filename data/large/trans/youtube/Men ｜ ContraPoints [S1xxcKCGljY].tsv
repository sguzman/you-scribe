0	7960	Hi boys, it's me again.
7960	8960	Just your average girl.
8960	14160	Look, I may be a biological female, but I do hope that just for this video we're able
14160	16920	to converse as men.
16920	21320	I want you to think back to 2016, which I know in internet years is like halfway between
21320	23160	now and the decline of Rome.
23160	24500	Do you like history boys?
24500	25960	How did Rome fall again?
25960	27800	Was it the gays?
27800	29220	Tell me all about it.
29220	34220	Back in 2016, the big internet culture war was between feminists on one side, and men's
34220	36080	rights activists on the other.
36080	37080	Whatever happened to that?
37080	42460	These days it's as dead a meme as, I don't know, Harambe.
42460	44220	I did want to do the fedora though.
44220	48540	Every YouTuber who's ever covered the men's rights movement has done the fedora, and I
48540	50460	wanted to put my own little twist on it.
50460	56620	My wardrobe notes for this video say, MRA femme fatale and fedora but make it fashion.
56620	57620	School shooter realness.
57620	59180	I feel like I'm also serving a little…
59180	61140	Oh.
61140	63580	Red-pilled Carmen Sandiego.
63580	68660	In this video, I want to ask, in all seriousness, what are we going to do about men?
68660	76200	Because no offense, but as a group, you guys kind of seem like you're not doing okay.
76200	80500	Could a group of people who are purchasing uncooked alpha yogurt possibly be subsisting
80500	82800	in a state of psychological balance?
82800	86140	Fellas, are regular bowel movements gay?
86140	87180	I guess yeah, kind of.
87180	88180	You don't see a whole lot of psyllium hustling.
88180	89180	I'm not sure.
89180	90180	I'm not sure.
90180	91180	I'm not sure.
91180	92180	I don't think I'm going to be a big fan of the trans-heterosexual medicine cabinets.
92180	93180	I'm losing my target audience here.
93180	96740	Listen, my dudes, let's just say, I'm kind of worried about you guys.
96740	98760	And I'm not saying I'm any better.
98760	100820	To be clear, I'm not okay either.
100820	104360	There's like 15 jars of urine in my refrigerator right now.
104360	107140	Yeah, that's right, women pee too, okay?
107140	108140	Get over it.
108140	112680	I'm so sorry if this offends your male notions of feminine delicacy, but I, for one, will
112680	116140	not be shamed by your patriarchal bullshit.
116140	117140	Oh.
117140	118140	I'm sorry.
118140	119140	I'm sorry.
119140	122100	You boys, you're very rational, aren't you?
122100	124260	Ugh, I suppose I was too.
124260	128100	I admit that these days, rationality, it's something I struggle with,
128100	131140	both as a biological female and as a Pisces moon.
131140	133700	But when I decided I wanted to make a video for men,
133700	135780	Contra Pines, for men,
135780	142740	I started brushing up on my reasoning skills because I want to be so fucking rational for you.
142740	146340	So to prepare for this video, I read Newton's Principia Mathematica,
146340	148580	Wittgenstein's Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,
148580	153060	and of course, the philosophical classic The Rational Male by Royal Caliente.
153060	158900	So my mind is well lubricated and I am ready for what I have no doubt will be a penetrating,
158900	162420	intellectual… interchange.
162420	164740	Look, I want to play by your rules, okay?
164740	167300	So there will be no emotions in this video.
167300	170420	I will present my arguments in strict, logical form,
170420	174820	relying only on facts, reason, evidence, and deductive proof.
176340	178340	So let's get to it.
178340	192260	Actually, you know what, fuck that, let's listen to house music and do sex shrugs.
206340	208420	I'm pandering to the male gaze.
209460	211780	Oh, and the male's traits.
212420	213620	God, I love attention.
213620	214660	Hey, gorge.
214660	216020	Hey, gorge.
216020	218100	Hey, gorge.
218100	218820	Okay, I'm ready.
218820	220420	Let's crack open a cold one, boys.
222580	224980	My hands are too pretty to open the can.
224980	226820	I need a man to do it for me.
227460	229620	Help!
229620	230020	Fuck it.
232820	233940	Okay, that's super fucking pretty.
233940	234740	Hey, gorge.
234740	235540	Hey, gorge.
235540	236180	Are there any women?
236180	237860	Women still watching this video?
237860	241860	I'm really sorry about all this, unless you're into that sort of thing.
241860	243540	In which case, how very dare.
243540	244980	I'm a good Presbyterian.
244980	247300	And by Presbyterian, I do mean pansexual.
247300	248100	Hey, how are y'all?
248100	251380	Look, the video's about men, so I'm trying to be attractive to men.
252260	253300	Am I doing this right?
253300	254580	Is this what men like?
254580	255380	Traps.
255380	256580	Straps.
256580	258260	It is a risky look for a girl like me.
258260	260820	When you do a lingerie look, you know you're going to wind up somewhere
260820	263780	on the frankenfurter violet tchotchke didevantese spectrum?
263780	265940	Oh, but you don't know where exactly.
266180	268820	And that is a dangerous game, ladies.
268820	273380	I have to say, though, I actually am feeling pretty fucking empowered right now.
273380	277620	But, um, that could be because of the drugs.
277620	280580	Look, gentlemen, let's be rational.
280580	282420	And we're fooling around, okay?
282420	283060	Part one.
283940	284420	Oh, wait.
285380	286420	Rational.
286420	287380	Axiom one.
287940	289620	America's next top victim.
290180	295220	I think there is some truth to the idea that we live in a victimhood culture.
295220	296100	And I'm not just talking...
296180	299220	about campus SJWs with their microaggressions.
299220	300020	No, bitch.
300020	301460	This goes all the way to the top.
301460	304740	We have white people complaining about reverse racism.
304740	311220	We have the literal 1% complaining about ANTI-RAGE PREJUDICE.
312580	314900	That must be super fucking hard for you.
314900	319060	We have the heterosexual agenda organizing straight pride parades.
319060	323700	You know, flaunting their sexuality in the faces of children who are trying to raise a family,
323700	325780	and protesting in the street like a bunch of .
326180	330580	And so, of course, because there was women's rights, there has to be men's rights too.
330580	333220	I've been hearing about men's rights for my whole adult life,
333220	335380	and I've always been very skeptical.
335380	340500	Because in my experience, online men's rights activism in practice always looks like this.
340500	343620	Women try to do a good thing to solve a real problem,
343620	345460	and then a man shows up to say,
345460	347060	Well, what about men?
347060	348580	Men also get harassed.
348580	350580	Why aren't you talking about men?
350580	355220	And is this man actually involved in activism to stop harassment against men?
355220	357380	Of course he's fucking not.
357380	358900	He doesn't give a shit.
358900	360100	He's a troll.
360100	365140	His contribution to the conversation begins and ends with what about men?
365140	366340	What about them, honey?
366340	369220	For this video, I decided to actually do some research for once.
369220	373380	And the first thing I did was read the foundational text of the modern men's rights movement,
373380	376020	which is the Myth of Male Power by Warren Farrell.
376020	380260	Actually, I listened to the audiobook because, let's be honest, reading is hard.
380260	384900	But as I was listening, I admit I thought it made more sense than I was expecting it to.
385220	390100	Basically, Farrell says that second-wave feminists rightly fought against the traditional gender role
390100	392260	that confined women to domestic servitude.
392260	397940	But he argues that the feminist idea that men have all the power in society is actually an illusion,
397940	401620	because the traditional gender role for men is just as oppressive.
401620	404420	He introduces the idea of male disposability,
404420	409300	basically the idea that society values female lives more than male lives,
409300	414180	which are seen as expendable in the service of protecting and providing for women and children.
414180	415140	And he points to statistics,
415140	418420	showing that men make up the majority of military casualties,
418420	421780	workplace fatalities, murder victims, suicides, and so on.
421780	427220	So we're supposed to conclude that even though at first it looks like men have more power than women,
427220	430980	in fact, the queens have a certain kind of privilege
430980	435860	in being protected and provided for by the expendable male worker bees.
435860	438180	And I guess that kind of makes sense.
438180	441060	I feel like I can at least empathize with the point of view.
441060	443860	What I'm saying is, I took the red pill,
443860	445060	and I rubbed it on my clitoris,
445060	446020	and I rubbed it on my chest,
446020	447060	and I rubbed it on my chest, and I rubbed it on my chest,
447060	447620	and I rubbed it on my chest, and I rubbed it on my chest,
447620	450260	but some initial objections come to mind.
450260	455140	Like, haven't men been almost all of the kings, presidents, and CEOs for millennia?
455140	457700	Didn't men make up all these rules in the first place?
457700	458740	I don't know, boys.
458740	461300	Still seems kind of patriarchal to me.
461300	466980	But maybe you'll say that it's only at the top of society that men have more power than women.
466980	473140	Maybe the average man is also oppressed by the system that feminists call patriarchy.
473140	474420	If that's what you're saying,
475060	477620	I think I basically agree with that.
477620	482100	See, what you have to understand about me is I am such a fucking Libra.
482100	484740	Whenever there's a conflict, my gut reaction is to be like,
484740	488580	well, maybe everybody's right, and maybe there's good points on both sides,
488580	493620	and we should all just listen to each other and rub each other's cluuuuts.
493620	497140	But no, my Scorpio rising persona will not allow that.
497140	499300	Oh, there will be a champion.
499300	500660	There will be blood.
500660	502740	So, judges.
502740	504900	How do we decide which gender is American?
504900	506900	And who's America's next top victim?
506900	512260	I mean, it's not like you can just change genders and see how the other half lives.
512260	514180	Or can you?
514180	515700	Proposition two.
515700	518340	Diary of an X-man.
518340	525620	Dear diary, with every false smile I conceal that on the inside I'm drowning in darkness.
525620	528580	Mom, get out of my room.
528580	530020	You're ruining my life.
530020	534500	Look, I have never, ever talked about this on my channel before.
534900	537300	It's like a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.
537300	539220	But I was born a boy.
539220	542180	Well, was I ever really a boy?
542180	543300	It's hard to say.
543300	544580	Dear diary,
544580	549700	Growing up, I always knew that I was different from other kids, especially other boys.
549700	552900	And it took me so long to pinpoint what it was.
552900	555780	But there was this moment.
555780	558580	I must have been, what, seven, eight years old?
558580	561620	And I was playing in my parents' room all by myself.
561620	564020	And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.
564020	564500	And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.
564500	564820	And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.
564820	565700	And I saw this pair of my mom's shoes lying on the floor.
565700	567380	And I don't know what it was.
567380	570740	It was like this magnetism that drew me to them.
570740	574260	And I put my little feet in them and walked in front of the mirror.
574260	578420	And I didn't really have the words yet to describe how I felt.
578420	583700	But basically, in that moment, I sensed that God had made a mistake.
583700	588740	And I was destined to be, to be a Crosstresser.
591060	593300	That is super fucking coconuts.
593300	594420	Anyway, then in my 20s, my life completely changed.
594420	596740	My life completely fell apart and I became a woman.
596740	597700	Hey, how are you?
597700	599700	I became one of the dolls.
599700	601380	My plastic surgeon is an artist.
601380	605860	Look, boys, the point I'm trying to make here is I used to live your lifestyle.
605860	607380	I know what people like you get up to.
607380	609140	And I think it's disgusting.
609140	613300	I gotta say, though, since I transitioned, my life has been super fucking great.
613300	614580	Like, way better.
614580	618660	Now, of course, a lot of that is not because women have it better than men, but because...
618660	622420	Hey, gorge, I am literally transgendered.
622900	624020	So before I transitioned, I was like, oh my god.
624180	625620	I was dying inside, you know?
625620	627220	I was in the wrong body.
627220	632500	And now, it's like I finally have the body I was meant to die inside of.
632500	633860	But it's not just that.
633860	637620	I do think that, in some ways, since I started presenting as a woman,
637620	639620	people actually do treat me better.
639620	642260	I mean, they take my opinions less seriously, sure.
642260	644980	But that's probably for the best.
644980	648260	Now, before using my personal experience as any kind of evidence,
648260	650260	I guess I should say a couple caveats.
650260	654020	Caveat one is that most pre-transition trans women are gay.
654020	655700	They're not like other boys.
655700	660100	And most of us, we're not living the business-class male experience by any means.
660100	662340	You know, it's a lot of drunk melancholics,
662340	665860	tormented sissies, secretive transvestites,
665860	669700	poets, you know, that sort of thing.
669700	675140	Caveat two is that my trans experience is not THE trans experience.
675140	679380	And I do have a lot of other privileges that made things go super fucking well for me.
679380	680340	Hey, how are yo?
680340	683300	Don't you just love it when someone checks their privilege in a way that's actually...
683300	685460	It's actually just bragging.
685460	689460	You know, it's super important for me to acknowledge that I've been so successful
689460	694820	and I've come so far in part because I'm white and I'm skinny and I'm young
694820	700340	and I'm blonde and I'm rich and I pass and I'm educated and I'm popular
700340	704340	and my plastic surgeon is an artist and my boyfriend is really rich and hot
704340	706500	and I come from a pure Aryan bloodline.
706500	709700	And part of what makes me so enlightened and so compassionate
709700	713060	is that I'm able to recognize these privileges that I have
713060	718180	that just might not be available to people who are less fortunate.
718180	720660	From the bottom of my mother-fucking-at-my-father-fucking-heart
720660	724260	that must be super fucking hard for you, I can't even imagine.
724260	727380	What I was saying is there are ways that people treat me better now
727380	728820	that I'm presenting as a woman.
728820	730580	You know, people smile at me more.
730580	732580	I feel more taken care of.
732580	734500	Men do things for me.
734500	737380	Now, a lot of women don't like men doing things for them,
737380	740020	you know, holding doors, helping with luggage,
740020	742820	because they feel that it's infantilizing or condescending.
743460	744660	But not me.
744660	745860	I love it.
745860	749860	Both because I love attention and because I'm a recumbent queen
749860	752100	who's too much of a delicate flower to lift a finger.
752100	754420	I do this thing on airplanes where when it's time for me
754420	756900	to put my carry-on luggage in the overhead bin,
756900	760100	I pretend that my bag is too heavy for me to lift
760100	763220	and then some man will usually get up and do it for me
763220	765220	even though I'm taller than most men.
765220	766420	It makes me happy.
766420	768340	Another good thing about becoming a woman is
768340	770820	I integrated into female social groups
770820	772820	and I found that they provide a kind of
772820	775460	communal support and overt affection
775460	778420	that male social groups generally just don't.
778420	781700	I find that female social style suits me better than the male one
781700	784740	which tends to be more atomized, more individualist
784740	789860	where affection is always concealed behind this semi-jokey front of competition.
789860	793540	Like, think about the way boys talk to each other when they play video games.
793540	795300	A third improvement for me has to do with the way
795300	797780	men and women are treated in public space.
797780	799620	When you present female in public
799620	801220	you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle to be caught up in, so to speak, when you're screened as a zombie.
801220	801720	When you present a female in public, you're more likely to be treated as a spectacle, to be caught up in, and more often than not, an idol in front of a mirror.
801720	807980	spectacle to be commented upon. People, usually men, will just blurt out their opinions about
807980	814060	you. Sometimes complimentary, sometimes insulting, sometimes just fucking weird. Whereas, when
814060	819040	you present male in public, you're more likely to be treated either as invisible or as dangerous.
819620	823960	Now, feminists have traditionally interpreted these differences as men asserting dominance
823960	829000	over women in public space, and they've criticized catcalling as being objectifying, degrading,
829000	833640	and misogynistic. And it certainly can be all of those things. There's different kinds of
833640	838280	catcalling, and I have different feelings about them. If I'm walking with another woman, and a
838280	844340	man says, ladies, you look beautiful tonight. I don't know. I like that. I think that's nice.
844620	850420	It makes me feel seen. It makes me feel admired. It boosts my confidence. Whereas, if I'm walking
850420	856980	alone, and a drunk starts following me down the street, singing, have you seen a polythene Pam?
857160	858960	She's so good looking, what she looks like.
859000	859560	A man.
860700	865400	That, I am less enthusiastic about. I mean, not that that's ever happened.
866060	868300	I'm completely fucking unclockable, hey, how are you?
868860	874120	No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.
874980	879140	I definitely get where feminists are coming from, because street harassment sucks. I'm a lot more
879140	884260	afraid walking alone at night than I used to be, and there's a lot more places I just won't go by
884260	888980	myself. But on the other hand, I do now enjoy being able to walk down the street at night,
889000	894880	without other people acting afraid of me. I think a lot of feminists have failed to imagine the ways
894880	901540	that being treated as invisible or dangerous can also kind of suck. In my video on incels,
901540	907480	I talked about male invisibility on dating apps, and how getting no attention at all can actually
907480	912160	be emotionally worse than getting a lot of shitty attention. And when it comes to being treated as
912160	918820	dangerous, when I was living as a man, sometimes if I was walking at night, a woman on the same
918820	925060	block as me would change sides of the street. And I totally get why. Men do scary shit sometimes,
925060	931540	and it's better to be safe. But it's still stung a little bit to be treated as dangerous by default.
931540	936820	I think it can actually be harmful, which becomes clearer if we add race into the equation. There's
936820	941920	ways that white women's fear can actually be dangerous, in particular to black men.
941920	945640	I had an experience with this recently when I was filming my video The Apocalypse,
945640	948760	and I had rented a room in a hotel casino. Around midnight,
948760	952960	I was carrying some camera equipment up to my room, and I got into the elevator with a group
952960	958060	of people from the casino floor. A couple floors up, everyone got out of the elevator except for me,
958060	963520	and a single black man. Well, I mean, he was alone. I don't know if he was single. That's
963520	967720	not part of the story. And as soon as the door closed, he started literally whistling Row,
967720	972460	Row, Row Your Boat, the official melody of performative innocence. And I realized,
972460	978580	oh shit, he's afraid that I'm afraid. And I found that just excruciating. I was like,
978760	985240	oh god, how do other white women behave in elevators? Do they, like, clutch their purses?
986380	992200	Ugh, that's so foggy embarrassing. Nothing like that had ever happened to me when I was living
992200	997360	as a man. It's not a thing between black men and white men. It's a thing between black men
997360	1002580	and white women. And so that dynamic was there, not just because I'm white and he's black, but
1002580	1007560	because I'm a woman and he's a man. And I thought of that incident again when I was listening to
1008760	1014340	it. And Farrell says, men's greatest weakness is their facade of strength, and women's greatest
1014340	1019440	strength is their facade of weakness. I think there is some truth to the idea that women's
1019440	1024840	perceived vulnerability can make them powerful, and men's perceived power can make them vulnerable.
1024840	1028560	Now I hope you're taking all this with a grain of salt, because these are just some little
1028560	1034140	observations I've made based on a handful of anecdotes. And as rational males, it's important
1034140	1038380	that we consider the facts, the stats, and the figures. Did you know?
1038380	1046960	Did you know that 46% of men are at least 2.8 times different than 73% of women? Look it up.
1046960	1053320	I haven't. I guess my super fucking Libra opinion is that there's upsides and downsides to male and
1053320	1058000	female experience. I don't actually think there's a single definite answer to the vague and useless
1058000	1063400	question, which gender has it worse? I consider myself a feminist because I support reproductive
1063400	1068320	rights and I oppose workplace misogyny, and I generally agree with a lot of the activism that
1068380	1072340	happens under the heading of feminism. But I also think a lot of men are just
1072340	1076360	having a super fucking difficult time right now, and that must be super fucking hard for them,
1076360	1080800	eh? How are you? And I don't think feminists have an obligation to care about male angst,
1080800	1086320	but I care about you boys. God, I'm such a cool girl, I think the entire mid-Atlantic
1086320	1090460	region is about to freeze over. No, I'm just a super fucking empathetic Pisces moon,
1090460	1098260	and I really try to understand other people's pain, because I just find it really, really funny.
1098380	1105640	I'm also really, really sobering up here. The drugs have worn off, and I'm suddenly feeling
1105640	1112420	very naked. Like, it's just now occurring to me that this is a highly inappropriate outfit for
1112420	1118240	this occasion. So, I'm gonna go put on a robe, and I'll meet you back for the next section.
1119080	1121840	Postulate 3. The Man Question.
1127660	1128320	Hi boys.
1128380	1129520	Et cetera, et cetera.
1129520	1131080	Hey, how are you?
1131080	1137140	For the last three years on this channel, I have been your Virgil, leading you through gender hell.
1137140	1143560	Pick-up artists, gender dysphoria, incels, radical feminists, non-binary genders,
1143560	1149200	men's rights activists. It seems like everybody's having gender trouble, so what do we make of that?
1149200	1156760	Well, Gorg, a very, very rational male philosopher named Hegel once said that the unfolding of
1156760	1157660	history is a
1157660	1163480	basically rational process, Gorg. That means that at any time in history, society is based
1163480	1169280	on certain principles, like, um, all men are created equal as long as they're super fucking
1169280	1174680	rich and white. And there's always contradictions within those principles, which creates tension
1174680	1179400	and eventually leads to a rupture, like a revolution, where society has to be reorganized
1179400	1183480	according to new principles. At least, I think he was saying something like that. It's pretty
1183480	1186800	hard to make anything out through the fog of his unreadable, hyper-abstract man-jabbing.
1186800	1193220	God, I can't stand that shit. Or any of the other music-hating vol-cells of the male philosophical
1193220	1197460	tradition. My point is, I think our society has reached a place where gender as we know
1197460	1201920	it just isn't working anymore. Now, no one seems to agree why it isn't working or how
1201920	1206920	to fix it, but we do all agree that it's broken. We have mainstream feminists saying we need
1206920	1210680	to continue advancing the rights of women. We have conservatives saying we need to restore
1210680	1214860	the gender roles of the 1950s. We have an increasing number of people not identifying
1214860	1216660	as men or women. We have TERFs saying we need to restore the gender roles of women. We have
1216660	1219980	transphobic TERFs who think that the transgenders are the single greatest threat to civilization,
1219980	1224080	hey, how are you? And we have men's rights activists saying we need a male equivalent
1224080	1228880	to feminism to liberate men from their oppressive gender role. Now, I want to focus on that
1228880	1234620	last one, because in principle, I agree. I've spent a lot of the last three years covering
1234620	1238960	the manosphere. I know, such a feminine topic, love that for me. And from all the time I've
1238960	1244900	tortured myself wading through these communities of incels, pick-up artists, men's rights slacktivists,
1244900	1245900	intellectual dark web fanboys, and anti-feminism activists, I've come to the conclusion that
1245900	1246420	I'm not the only one who thinks that the transgenders are the single greatest threat to civilization,
1246420	1246520	hey, how are you? And we have men's rights activists saying we need a male equivalent to feminism to liberate
1246520	1249080	men from their oppressive gender role. Now, I've spent a lot of the last three years On
1249080	1253780	the same planet world, somewhere in our own lives, some of those healthy species have
1253780	1258880	nothing to do with us or anything else, and all of our vakas and 1000s of racisms have
1258880	1260640	nothing to do with that mother24 and the others, but happens to be a lie to me. Yeah,
1260640	1262440	morph forests, freaking you guys and shit, bullshit. Yeah. But to at least identify who
1262440	1263700	long, crossedació this great opportunity of our funky moments because,
1263700	1267080	it all starts from up here, says Mike. And you lie to me, you mean七
1267080	1269440	And just to clarify, I'm not trying to take away your video games and pornography,
1269440	1272260	but I am not telling you what to do with your penis, you can rub one out once in a while
1272260	1273220	for this video for all I care–let's just move on.
1273220	1274220	ok?
1274220	1276280	Don't pull a GamerKeed on me, okay?
1277740	1279020	I live in fear.
1279020	1281500	Look, I like to believe that until the red pillars
1281500	1285280	inject their poison, most of these boys are not bad people.
1285280	1288080	I think all of this originates in a genuine crisis
1288080	1290240	of male identity, and I think it's happened
1290240	1293300	in something like the way men's rights activists describe.
1293300	1295820	The sacrificial role of men as warriors
1295820	1298280	is no longer widely glorified or necessary.
1298280	1300640	The traditional protector-provider role of men
1300640	1302820	is being replaced by a more equal
1302820	1304720	and undefined gender dynamic.
1304720	1307300	And college professors and activists are telling men
1307300	1310220	that most of our culture's aspirational representations
1310220	1312320	of manhood are toxic and bad.
1312320	1314400	But without an attractive replacement vision
1314400	1317420	of aspirational manhood, average young men
1317420	1320940	can only envision their future as what?
1320940	1324820	The beta, the cock, the new male.
1324820	1326340	And in a post-left-toop internet,
1326340	1328880	we're so used to laughing at this vocabulary.
1328880	1331540	And to be fair, it is very funny.
1331540	1332420	But we forget,
1332420	1334920	especially us grills, that for a lot of men,
1334920	1338820	these words actually do tap into a deep existential angst.
1338820	1340200	And a lot of leftists go,
1340200	1342200	well, how can men be so angsty?
1342200	1344900	Especially white men, they're so privileged.
1344900	1348740	But existential angst is often a disease of privilege.
1348740	1351740	If you're actually being oppressed, you have a struggle,
1351740	1355220	you have something to fight for, and therefore, a purpose.
1355220	1357740	But for a lot of men, their lack of purpose
1357740	1360020	puts them in search of a struggle.
1360020	1362320	And that, along with the loneliness
1362320	1364420	and the lack of a positive identity,
1364420	1366680	is what makes men vulnerable to recruitment
1366680	1369060	by the manosphere groups and by the alt-right.
1369060	1372000	And even worse, it seems to be a motivating factor
1372000	1374540	for the small but growing number of young men
1374540	1376200	who decide to pick up a gun
1376200	1378340	and open fire in a shopping center.
1378340	1380240	There were two mass shootings during the weekend
1380240	1383540	I was writing this video, resulting in 31 deaths.
1383540	1385240	Both shooters were young white men,
1385240	1387440	and one of them posted about the shooting
1387440	1388820	on an alt-right image board.
1388820	1390200	Now, I don't pretend to fully understand
1390200	1391200	the motives of mass shooters, but I don't think it's true.
1391200	1392200	I don't think it's true.
1392200	1393600	I don't think it's a coincidence
1393600	1395540	that basically all of them are men.
1395540	1398620	One possible interpretation of the mass shooting epidemic
1398620	1401200	is that these killers are trying to resurrect
1401200	1404420	some horrible parody of ancient masculine glory,
1404420	1408400	and therefore, to be seen and recognized as men
1408400	1411880	by unleashing Homeric violence in a fucking Walmart.
1411880	1413600	And of course, there's also the racism
1413600	1414960	of the alt-right killers,
1414960	1417980	and the wounded sexual entitlement of the incel killers.
1417980	1421540	But that racism and that sexual entitlement are learned,
1421540	1424020	and men in the throes of a masculinity crisis
1424020	1425920	are more receptive to learning it.
1425920	1428360	So, you can try to take down their forums,
1428360	1431420	and ban their accounts, and de-platform their events,
1431420	1435300	but as long as this male identity crisis goes on,
1435300	1438000	I don't see any end to these problems.
1438000	1440360	Theorem four, what do?
1440360	1443160	There is this media narrative that has emerged
1443160	1445120	around me and around this channel.
1445120	1447220	And by the way, the fact that there's any kind
1447220	1449120	of media narrative about this channel
1449120	1451420	is super fucking coconuts.
1451420	1453140	Because let's be real, Gorge,
1453140	1454920	I just wanted to pour milk on my face
1454920	1456260	and talk about the mouthfeel.
1456260	1458300	But there's this media narrative that my role
1458300	1463300	in the discourse is de-radicalizing young alt-right men.
1464600	1466180	And it's true that if you read
1466180	1468480	the leftist YouTube fan subreddits,
1468480	1470860	I used to be alt-right posts are so common
1470860	1472300	they're considered cliche.
1472300	1474700	And some of them cite me as an influence
1474700	1478020	in changing their politics, which I love for them,
1478020	1480940	and I'm super fucking happy about it, but it's also,
1480940	1483620	um, a lot of responsibility.
1483620	1488140	They're my boys, and I worry about my boys.
1488140	1490040	Because in reality, it's not like they go
1490040	1492820	from far right extremists to complacent centrists.
1492820	1495100	No, most of them go far left.
1495100	1497780	A lot of them become communists or anarchists.
1497780	1499700	So I watch them go from far to my right
1499700	1501780	to significantly to my left.
1501780	1504920	It's not really de-radicalizing so much as re-radicalizing.
1504920	1506900	And I think it's definitely an improvement,
1506900	1509560	but I still worry it's not gonna be enough.
1509560	1512780	I worry about my boys because I don't think
1512780	1516540	that the left yet has a final solution to the man question.
1516540	1519120	Oh no, that was worded poorly.
1519120	1521080	You know, there's kind of two options the left has
1521080	1522340	for disillusioned men.
1522340	1525800	The first is the Marxist promise of economic revolution.
1525800	1528620	We say, well, actually, yes, you are oppressed,
1528620	1531620	but you're oppressed because of your class, not your gender.
1531620	1532860	So just join the revolution.
1532860	1534820	It's gonna be super fucking crazy.
1534820	1537360	We're gonna overthrow the bourgeoisie, meow, meow.
1537360	1539280	Smash, no voting.
1539280	1541560	And then things will be better for you.
1541560	1544180	Now, I think that has a couple limitations.
1544180	1546880	One is that I look at the far left
1546880	1549580	and I see a bunch of people who spend all their time
1549580	1552200	accusing each other of abusing moderator privileges
1552200	1553680	in closed Facebook groups.
1553680	1557700	And I'm concerned that might not succeed
1557700	1560040	at ending capitalism, meow, meow.
1560040	1561940	Like definitely vote for Bernie Sanders
1561940	1563440	or Elizabeth Warren or whoever.
1563440	1566060	But if you're investing all of your hopes
1566060	1569260	in a capital R revolution, I worry that can be
1569280	1572520	become like waiting for Godot or waiting for the rapture.
1572520	1574140	So we do need political change,
1574140	1578080	but I feel like I'm failing my boys
1578080	1579700	if I'm somehow giving them the idea
1579700	1581920	that revolution is their only hope.
1581920	1583220	Cause here's the other thing,
1583220	1585920	even if we did succeed ending capitalism,
1585920	1587140	there would still be gender.
1587140	1590260	And my boys would still need some model
1590260	1593480	of what it is to lead a good life as a man.
1593480	1596140	Now the other option the left has for disillusioned men
1596140	1598340	is the feminist tranquilizer.
1598340	1598620	We say, look, talk about how it's not about how you live.
1598620	1599220	This is the feminist tranquilizer.
1599220	1603560	Toxic masculinity is the reason you don't have room to express your feelings and it's the reason
1603560	1607920	you feel lonely and inadequate. So while feminism tells women you hate your body and you're
1607920	1613540	constantly doubting yourself because society did this to you and needs to change, we kind of just
1613540	1619180	tell men you're lonely and suicidal because you're toxic. Stop it. We tell them they're broken without
1619180	1625900	really telling them how to fix themselves. I think what we need is a new positive ideal of manhood
1625900	1630820	which I don't think is something that women can create for men even if they wanted to. And honestly
1630820	1635440	the best way for that to happen may actually be some kind of men's movement. But on the left the
1635440	1641360	whole idea of a men's movement is basically taboo because the men's movement we all know is basically
1641360	1647820	just a backlash to feminism and at worst it's just straight up misogyny. And look boys, I understand
1647820	1653160	that being lectured about man spreading for most of 2015 was super fucking hard for you and you're
1653160	1655880	still mad about it but posting endless
1655880	1661360	outrage porn about false rape accusations and paternity fraud isn't actually going to make life
1661360	1666920	any better for you. Because yes, those things are horrible when they happen but they're not systemic
1666920	1673200	issues that affect most men. I think what would actually improve life for most men is a positive
1673200	1679780	ideal of 21st century manhood but that's not something I can give to you because in case you
1679780	1684800	hadn't noticed I'm literally a fucking woman. I can't mom you through this one boys, you're on
