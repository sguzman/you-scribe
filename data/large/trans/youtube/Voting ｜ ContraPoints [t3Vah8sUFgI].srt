1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,800
Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,600
aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:31,520
is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile, and I will

4
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,500
not stop until I reach the gates of hell.

5
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:37,940
You know what, America?

6
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,340
Things have not gone well.

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,080
We're having a hard time.

8
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,600
We are.

9
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,980
Between the plague, the quarantine, the oppressive policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising

10
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,600
tide of fascism, the criminalization.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Criminal negligence of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease that

12
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,720
has killed 200,000 people and counting.

13
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,440
Of course, there's going to be some trumpet in the comments saying, it's not that big

14
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,860
a deal.

15
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,240
Calm down.

16
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,700
People die all the time.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,400
Funny, that's not what she said about Benghazi.

18
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,640
We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness.

19
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:22,040
And unfortunately, Uncle Joe is not really the man for the job.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:27,680
I was a Bernie supporter and I regret not being more vocal about it when I had the chance.

21
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,160
So this time, I'm going to say something.

22
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:34,920
Because even though Biden is not my boy, I still think that dethroning Trump by electing

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,920
Biden is the single most important thing any American can do right now.

24
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,460
So allow me to make my case gorge.

25
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,600
By now leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video and I'm sure they're firing

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,360
off hot takes as we speak.

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,880
Typical T-Thought Normie Radlib endorses the election of Donald Trump.

28
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,880
I don't know if that's the right word.

29
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,880
I don't know.

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
I don't know.

31
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,880
I don't know.

32
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,880
I don't know.

33
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:55,880
I haven't seen the current electoral farce.

34
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Is this your leftist queen of YouTube?

35
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,520
Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain about canceled culture than revolt

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,000
against the neoliberal status quo.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tabby chan.

38
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Tabby chan.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,120
You know what, Tabitha?

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,820
For once I'm actually going to take the bait.

41
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:13,480
So this will be a conversation with the communist Twitter cat girl that lives in my brain.

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,520
Ne-aw.

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,040
I'm making this video because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so

44
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,320
disillusioned with . . .

45
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:25,880
that system that they intend not to vote in this election and yeah some of them are probably

46
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,800
russian bots but that's fine maybe i can win over the russian bot vote so i really do understand

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:36,920
the perspective that biden is not worth voting for because that was also my first reflex when

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,760
he was nominated but on reflection i think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake

49
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,320
don't make me in my bathroom tile children there's probably asbestos in that tile because america's

50
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:52,680
so great even the floor is made of poison okay tabby chan give me your worst i want free health

51
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,200
care student debt cancelled and worker ownership of the means of production biden won't give us

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,880
any of that and i don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change things

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:07,640
well listen tabby chan none of us want to vote for joe biden i don't want to vote for joe biden

54
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,080
any more than i want to retile my bathroom but sometimes a situation gets so toxic and so

55
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,240
dangerous well you have no choice but to get your hands dirty and in this election

56
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:24,200
i consider a vote for biden primarily a vote against trump you know voting for a politician

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:29,320
is not necessarily the same as supporting the politician i don't think anyone should

58
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:35,560
stand joe biden i'm not asking you to like comment and subscribe to joe biden's only fans

59
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:41,960
fascinating though i'm sure it is the president has a big stick to me voting is more of a

60
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:47,160
utilitarian calculation based on the likely consequences of each candidate

61
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,300
winning or losing the election it's not just a vote for the president it's a vote for the president

62
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:54,260
It's not hero worship, it's not choosing a person to have a beer with, it's strategy.

63
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,360
Bad strategy?

64
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,040
Biden is no better than Trump.

65
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,740
The Dems are just Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility.

66
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:07,340
Well, I agree that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's

67
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,060
no difference between them and the Republicans.

68
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,740
I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real difference between Trump and Hillary,

69
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,620
but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would not have done.

70
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:23,500
Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion fanatics, withdrawing from the

71
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,540
Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting

72
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,860
to remove medical non-discrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the

73
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:36,020
integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling

74
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,880
white nationalist militias very fine people and telling them to stand by, aspiring to

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,620
be an autocratic dictator and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing

76
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:44,720
a democracy that is not a democracy.

77
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,060
And a deadly pandemic in the name of delusional macho posturing.

78
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,540
So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make a real difference if they're

79
00:04:52,540 --> 00:05:03,680
in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're a woman or LGBTQ or a human who

80
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,280
lives on the planet Earth.

81
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,080
So Biden will give us rainbow capitalism and streets named after Black Lives Matter, but

82
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,600
he'll do nothing to bring about systemic change.

83
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Well, Tabby Chan.

84
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm sorry to say.

85
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,480
I agree with you about that.

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:20,980
I fully expect to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted

87
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,980
for.

88
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:27,020
So you sit here vote-shaming me and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?

89
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,240
You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote.

90
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Tabby Chan.

91
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Tabby Chan.

92
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,060
Look, I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade.

93
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:39,240
Why is it that when you tell people on the left to vote, they think you're saying quit

94
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,940
your job, abandon your family, retreat from society, and fall into a deep slumber from

95
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:48,300
which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib before fleeing into

96
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,700
the forest and reentering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch temple awaiting

97
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:55,380
the return of Baals above?

98
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,700
Voting doesn't take that long.

99
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,480
At most it takes one day.

100
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,440
You can vote and do other things also.

101
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,220
I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman with the we'd be at brunch

102
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220
sign.

103
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,380
And I feel you, though, to be honest, I would eat a Louis 16th style armchair with a pair

104
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,320
of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now.

105
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,680
Could you be any bougier?

106
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,680
Don't call me bougie.

107
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
I'm beyond bougie.

108
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,920
When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie, I scoff at them openly.

109
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,380
I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my fiefdom.

110
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,220
You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine.

111
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,920
Why should I listen to what you say?

112
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,920
Oh, you shouldn't.

113
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,160
I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly.

114
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,160
But also, I am a degenerate class traitor, and in my opinion, influencers should be the

115
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,160
first against the wall.

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,160
Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly.

117
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,160
I'm not a class traitor.

118
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
I just want to get it over with.

119
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,120
You at least have to admire that about us, libs.

120
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,160
We have a remarkable willingness to have polite conversations with people who are trying

121
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,160
to kill us.

122
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,100
Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan, but what is your plan,

123
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Tabitha?

124
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
Uh, protest?

125
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,100
Unionize?

126
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,100
Mutual aid?

127
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,100
Strikes?

128
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,100
So I totally agree.

129
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,640
Those are all good things to do.

130
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,960
I've gone to protests myself this year.

131
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,160
I've given to a mutual aid group.

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:12,160
You know, you're right that voting won't fix all our problems, and it's good to get

133
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,160
involved in local things.

134
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,600
But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?

135
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,320
And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus.

136
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,160
So in addition to whatever else you're doing, vote.

137
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,540
Why participate in the charade of a farcical election?

138
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
America is not democratic.

139
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,540
It's a rigged, two-party corporadocracy.

140
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,860
Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot wrong with our elections.

141
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,160
Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression,

142
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,160
DC being disenfranchised.

143
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,160
All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't think that in this moment, leftists

144
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,400
boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.

145
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,400
Okay, but voting is for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit.

146
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Ew.

147
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,780
Okay, yeah, it's true that voting is not cool.

148
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
It's boring.

149
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,780
It's incrementalist.

150
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,600
It doesn't make you feel like you're owning the libs or being edgier than your parents.

151
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,400
But you know, you could always vote in secret and then maintain your radical image around

152
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,400
your friends.

153
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,400
Isn't being involved in politics inherently not cool?

154
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:17,020
Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things, people who

155
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,560
place their hope in fallible human beings, all of which is very not cool.

156
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,780
I feel like so much of internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing.

157
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:31,520
It's showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through all

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,020
the bullshit, the corrupt system, the electoral farce, but all you're doing about it is sitting

159
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,360
here shitposting and demeaning the people who are actually trying to accomplish what

160
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
little can be accomplished.

161
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:48,480
And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing are no different

162
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,560
from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.

163
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:56,540
Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.

164
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,180
Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses?

165
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,780
This ends in violence either way, so we may as well smash.

166
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:08,100
Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly, but if there's a decisive Biden

167
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,400
victory, and it's not some kind of vote recount nightmare, then I'm not going to vote against

168
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
him.

169
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,220
I think the military will force Trump to leave.

170
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,760
Don't get me wrong, Tabby Chan, times are tough, the president is a fascist, I think

171
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:24,000
this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising than it's ever been in my life.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,140
But if it comes to smashing, you're going to want allies.

173
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:32,700
And for a lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory, therefore rejecting

174
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:36,720
democracy itself, that would legitimize smashing.

175
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,680
So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.

176
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,480
But capitalism is the root of the problem.

177
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:45,880
The whole system is broken and voting won't change that.

178
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,120
We don't need a democrat, we need to end capitalism.

179
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,080
Tabitha, capitalism is an epic world economic order.

180
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,380
When you say end capitalism, you're talking about a tectonic shift in global politics

181
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:07,140
that is so much bigger than all of us that I don't really understand what course of action

182
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,140
you're recommending.

183
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,280
Like, before capitalism, there was feudalism.

184
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
And feudalism is a very big thing.

185
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
It's a huge thing.

186
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,680
And feudalism ended over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population and production.

187
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,020
Not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism.

188
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:27,460
So won't capitalism end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it?

189
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,040
I don't think that's the kind of thing that can be accomplished by a small group of activists.

190
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,760
And I say small group because, I'm sorry to break it to you, but the vast majority of

191
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,440
Americans are not communists.

192
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,960
I think a lot of internet leftists have a vastly overinflated society.

193
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,960
And I'm not saying they're not communists.

194
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,640
I'm just saying they have a very very overinflated sense of how big and important they are.

195
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,920
I fell prey to it myself.

196
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:48,820
Like, I was so sure that Bernie was going to win the primary.

197
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,260
In part because, when I looked at my timeline, I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support

198
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,720
for Bernie and contempt for the mainstream Dems.

199
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:02,080
But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds, is a finely curated and

200
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,040
very unrepresentative sample of the population.

201
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,960
You have to remember that only 22% of Americans use Twitter at all.

202
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,300
Most users rarely tweet.

203
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,860
And 80% of tweets come from 10% of users.

204
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:20,200
So 80% of tweets come from 2% of Americans, and it's not a representative 2%.

205
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,420
According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population in that they're

206
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,080
on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats, more educated, and a higher

207
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,080
income.

208
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:35,660
And far-left, hammer-and-sickle Twitter is an even smaller, even more unrepresentative

209
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,180
sample within a sample.

210
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,140
We're talking about less than 0.1% of Americans.

211
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:45,480
And that less than 0.1% does have an outsize influence, because they're prolific tweeters,

212
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,100
and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform.

213
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,480
Which is why there's so much discourse about cancel culture, even though cancel culture

214
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,620
is produced by a relatively tiny group of people.

215
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,680
So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians cater to this retrograde soft

216
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,460
conservatism, you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.

217
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:08,300
Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign.

218
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,300
And I invited a group of people to join me.

219
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
And I invited a group of people to join me.

220
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,300
And I invited a group of people to join me.

221
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,300
And I invited a group of people to join me.

222
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,300
After some resourceful engagement, I convinced them to commit to supporting the process.

223
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,300
After some resourceful engagement, I convinced them to commit to supporting the process.

224
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:20,580
And I really recommend that leftists try doing this for at least one election, even though

225
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,300
it is the worst thing in the world and I hated it so much.

226
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,300
You know, you do have to listen to a lot of

227
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:30,200
I don't want Barack Hussein Obama redistributing my wealth.

228
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:35,460
Okay Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama is not sending his death panels out to your landscaping

229
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,480
business but whatever.

230
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities of which your fellow Republicans are in a

231
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:39,980
difficult position.

232
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:45,820
Americans actually care about. And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,

233
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,980
you know, I talked to union families, but I don't think I talked to a single communist. You know,

234
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,580
most people do not read theory. Most people are concerned primarily with themselves and their

235
00:12:56,580 --> 00:13:00,960
families. They want personal security and prosperity. And if you look at the talking

236
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:05,660
points used by politicians, they reflect that. That's why the right hammer is not about Antifa

237
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,520
so much. Because it works. Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.

238
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:16,420
And this idea of Antifa looters and riots, it scares the shit out of people. Of course,

239
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:23,400
in reality, Antifa is not scary. Like, I've met Antifa. And Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.

240
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:31,180
It's Ryan and his transgender, furry anarchist friends. But look, if what you want is socialism,

241
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:35,600
or even just social democracy, then you have a lot of work ahead of you,

242
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,600
in terms of outreach. You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness. But you don't want to

243
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,420
do that, because it requires that you stop owning the libs and start actually communicating with

244
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:52,560
them. You have to build alliances with, like, Facebook moms who ask ignorant questions, like,

245
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:57,920
what's Indigenous People's Day? And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the

246
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:02,320
height of praxis. And who probably watch ContraPoints, how embarrassing. You know,

247
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,640
you can't let your radical queer friends catch you associating with mainstream,

248
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:13,520
normie libs. How very bourgeois. But, revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.

249
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:20,340
Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution and overthrow the US

250
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:31,220
government. That's very valid. That's super hecking valid. That's extremely valid. I mean,

251
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:35,340
I guess I admire the ambition. Uh, just a couple quick follow-up questions, though.

252
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:41,700
Are you counting on the US military and police taking the side of the communists, or is your plan to overpower them?

253
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,260
Because unless you know something about the military that I don't, I don't think that

254
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,380
much of the military is going to defect to join a communist revolution. So there will have to be a war.

255
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:56,460
You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight. After the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from

256
00:14:56,460 --> 00:15:02,460
1917 to 1923. So you are going to need to raise a Red Army. I mean, you can't have a communist

257
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,460
revolution without a Red Army, right? So how's that going for you?

258
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:10,500
going, Tabitha? How many weapons have you amassed? How many units have you trained?

259
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:15,480
Why are we talking about this? Why am I even entertaining this notion? You know,

260
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,420
when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government, they actually mean

261
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:23,760
it. And you know they mean it because they have literal militias, the three percenters,

262
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,160
the boogaloo boys. They're stockpiling weapons and training to use them. They have ex-military

263
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:33,620
men in their ranks and connections to white supremacists within the police and the military.

264
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:40,780
Whereas when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter, it strikes me as ideation, not intent.

265
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,180
You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between two kinds of suicidal thinking. So

266
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,920
there's intent, which is when you have a plan for how you're going to do it, and then they have to

267
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,680
commit you because you're a danger to yourself. And then there's ideation, which is, you know,

268
00:15:55,700 --> 00:16:00,220
you're not actually going to do it, but you just have that inner monologue that's constantly saying,

269
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,500
I just want to die. There's no more joy.

270
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:08,060
I'm going to be left in this world. I just can't stand it anymore. I just want to end it all.

271
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:14,580
And then my psychiatrist says, well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro. And I say,

272
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:22,200
not again, doctor. Not again. So right-wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,

273
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:29,320
whereas left-wing radical discourse often amounts to revolutionary ideation. It's a kind of fantasy

274
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,180
escapism, an alternative to politics.

275
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:39,060
Plan a revolution. Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice.

276
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:44,540
Yeah, so a riot is the language of the unheard. But what kind of language is it?

277
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,380
What is the point of speaking through a riot, or a protest, or a strike? Is it just emotional

278
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:55,800
expression, like an angry diary entry? Or is the point not just to speak, but to be heard?

279
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:01,460
Heard by whomst? Who are you trying to persuade? The glob glob glob glob? No, you want to be

280
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,600
heard by the people with the power to change the world. You want to be heard by the people with the power to change the world.

281
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,540
You want to be heard by the people with the power to change things. So it matters whether the people

282
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:10,740
with power are likely to listen. This year, the U.S. has seen one of the biggest protest movements

283
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:16,080
in history. And what has that accomplished? Well, at the moment, we have a president promising to

284
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,160
double down on law and order, on military police suppression, a president who told a room full of

285
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,520
cops not to be too gentle with the people they arrest. And when you see these thugs being thrown

286
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:33,320
into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in rough. I said, please don't be too nice.

287
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:39,920
And let's be clear, both Biden and Copmala have an ugly record when it comes to crime and policing.

288
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:44,400
For most of his career, Biden has called for more policing, which is the opposite of what we need

289
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,200
right now. I'm right there with you, Tabby Chan. But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse

290
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,440
about policing and criminal justice. And Biden has responded by beginning to shift his position.

291
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,520
This year's Democratic platform includes things like stricter use of force standards,

292
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,720
banning chokeholds, restricting qualified immunity,

293
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:08,320
creating a registry of police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants, decriminalizing weed,

294
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,240
investing in crime prevention and social work. And is that good enough?

295
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,360
No, it's not good enough. But it's a start. It's progress. It shows that the Democrats are

296
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:22,640
at least willing to listen to protests. When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961,

297
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,400
he didn't want to propose a civil rights bill because that would have been super unpopular

298
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,920
with the Southern Democrats. But then 1963 happened, and there were protests and uprisings

299
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,720
in Washington, D.C., and the March on Washington that summer. And Kennedy listened.

300
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:43,040
The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality

301
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:48,720
that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.

302
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,000
He was moved by the protests, and he responded by introducing what became the

303
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,200
Civil Rights Act of 1964. But what if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963?

304
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,640
What if some fascist had been president? What if Trump had been president?

305
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:09,200
We might not have gotten a Civil Rights Act. So it does matter who's president. It actually

306
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,720
matters a lot. And please, Tabby Chun, do not let a fascist win to own the libs. God damn it.

307
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:22,720
All right, fam, let's open a new tab. Go to vote.gov and enter your state.

308
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,040
And yeah, I know this is boring, but I'm trying to think about the tantrum Trump

309
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:32,080
is going to throw when an entire nation rejects him, and I'm letting that motivate me.

310
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,000
Some states you can still register, so register now if you still haven't. If you're voting in

311
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,800
person, go to vote.org and find your polling place and make a plan for how you're going to get there.

312
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:51,200
Make sure your phone's charged, and you might want to bring some snacks or even some friends.

313
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,960
If you're like me, you need to set an alarm so you don't forget, and then just try not to get

314
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:02,000
inconsolably high until after you've placed your vote. Because we've all been living through a year

315
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:08,960
of financial crisis. And I, for one, think that we all deserve to begin 2021 by collectively
