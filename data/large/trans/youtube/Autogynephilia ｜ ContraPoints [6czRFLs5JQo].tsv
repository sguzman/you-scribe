0	2000	I
30000	41340	In 1989, a sex researcher named Ray Blanchard published a controversial, provocative, politically
41340	46520	incorrect theory claiming that trans women are not, as custom has it, essentially female
46520	48780	souls accidentally born into male bodies.
49000	54680	Instead, he claimed, they are men of two types, gay men who love straight men, and straight
54680	56020	men who love themselves.
56020	59720	For the latter condition, Blanchard coined the term autogynephilia.
60000	62580	New Greek for love of oneself as a woman.
62940	66980	It's a theory that contradicts what almost all trans women say and believe about themselves,
67200	71160	and affirms the common prejudice that trans people are really just sex perverts, which,
71460	74840	okay, some of us are, but not for the reasons Blanchard said.
90000	95180	One, just what the hell do I think I'm doing?
96300	100740	Rest assured, in this video I am going to argue that Blanchard's theory is false, but
100740	105340	a lot of trans women are probably nervously wondering why I'm using my platform to potentially
105340	110260	increase awareness of a sinister fringe theory that only adds to the stigma we all already
110260	110700	face.
110700	115940	After all, autogynephilia gives scientific legitimacy to our culture's most twisted
115940	117680	misrepresentations of trans women.
117680	118940	Who do you fuck with?
120000	125360	So it's understandable that to a lot of trans women, the prospect of this concept
125360	128060	gaining cultural traction is pretty terrifying.
128060	133200	However, I respond that, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transsexuals, I've had several
133200	137120	conversations with academics and journalists where it becomes clear that they believe in
137120	140480	Blanchard's theory, even if the cowards won't admit it to my face.
140480	145240	So as I see it, the damage is already done, what's needed now is an accessible, convincing
145240	146680	refutation of the theory.
146680	148940	I hope this video will accomplish three things.
148940	149940	1.
149940	152660	Persuasively argue that the wrong theory is wrong.
152660	153660	2.
153660	155660	Account for how a wrong theory became so influential.
155660	156660	3.
156660	161260	Move beyond some of the platitudes about trans people and open up a deeper discussion about
161260	163680	what it really means to be transgender.
163680	165020	Socrates?
165020	167020	You know the drill.
167020	168980	2.
168980	170440	Blanchard's Typology
170440	174620	The mainstream scientific view, endorsed by the World Professional Association for Transgender
174620	179780	Health, the DSM-5, and most practicing clinicians, is that the primary reason trans people trans
179780	182800	transition is to alleviate gender dysphoria.
182800	188820	Gender dysphoria is a state of social, emotional, anatomical, sexual, spiritual, and sartorial
188820	193400	angst relating to one's assigned birth sex, which is mostly relieved by socially and medically
193400	196600	transitioning to the gender of one's psychological identity.
196600	200820	This is what motivated me to transition, and I endorse the mainstream scientific view.
200820	204500	However, sex researcher Blanchard has a different theory.
204500	208500	According to Blanchard, trans women are driven to transition primarily by sexual motivations.
208500	213240	He didn't really bother to think about trans men or non-binary people, so you all
213240	214420	are excused.
214420	217060	You can just grab a beer and laugh it up.
217060	223100	Blanchard claims that trans women can be divided into two types of men, and yeah, I know, just
223100	224740	hold your objections for the end.
224740	227320	The first type are the homosexual transsexuals.
227320	231120	These gay boys cannot get enough dick, and who can blame them?
231120	236020	Essentially, the homosexual transsexuals are naturally effeminate gay men who transition
236020	237020	because 1.
237020	238020	1.
238020	241500	They're more disgusting of them as women than as very effeminate men, and 2.
241500	245240	Becoming women is a good sexual strategy for them since they do better as women in the
245240	250140	heterosexual dating market than as male femmes in the mask-for-mask dominated gay scene.
250140	254000	The second type of trans women are the autogynephilic transsexuals.
254000	259300	These inscrutable perverts can apparently get off just by looking in the mirror.
259300	264440	Blanchard describes autogynephiles as straight, bi, or self-avowed asexual men.
264440	267940	It doesn't really matter, because their primary sexual orientation is asexuality.
267940	272780	It's misdirected inward, leading to paraphilic sexual arousal at the thought of being or becoming
272780	275180	women, which is their true motivation to transition.
275180	278960	Now I'm going to argue that this theory is wrong, but first I want to acknowledge
278960	283660	that there does seem to be some observational validity to the claim that trans women tend
283660	286620	to fall into one of two clusters of correlated traits.
286620	291700	I'll replace the stigmatizing terms homosexual transsexual and autogynephile with more neutral
291700	297280	language, let's say cluster A and cluster B. Cluster A trans women are mostly androphilic,
297940	298940	attracted to men.
298940	303040	They transition relatively early in life and are very effeminate as children.
303040	307400	Cluster B trans women are mostly gynephilic, attracted to women, transition relatively
307400	310820	later in life, and have outwardly boyish childhoods.
310820	314320	When I first thought about this typology, it initially seemed pretty valid.
314320	318440	I went through the mental list of trans women I know, and found I could pretty easily sort
318440	319440	them.
319440	323180	Cluster A, cluster A, cluster B, cluster B. But as I've thought about it more, it's
323180	324180	partially unraveled.
324180	327940	Without even leaving my circle of acquaintances, I can think of a trans woman who falls into
327940	328940	one of two clusters.
328940	331320	A trans woman who followed all the cluster A patterns but now dates women, and a trans
331320	335200	woman who followed all the cluster B patterns but now exclusively dates men.
335200	340000	So while I think there may really be two genuine trends here, I interpret them merely as correlation
340000	342260	clusters that get fuzzy around the edges.
342260	347300	Blanchard, however, takes homosexual transsexuals and autogynephiles to be two sharply distinct
347300	351760	types, with two completely different psychosexual motivations to transition.
351760	356620	And this is what I strongly disagree with, the notion that male homosexuals' strategy,
356620	357940	or autogynephilic lust, is the same.
357940	361760	Transsexuals are the primary motivations to transition, and I have a lot of backup
361760	366740	here since trans women almost universally reject this characterization of their experience.
366740	370620	Now you'd think that'd be a major problem for the theory, but fortunately Blanchard
370620	375820	has an airtight response to that, namely that trans women who disagree with him are fucking
375820	376820	liars.
376820	379040	I mean that's really the scientific ideal, isn't it?
379040	381500	A theory that can't be falsified.
381500	383500	It's perfect.
383500	385500	3.
385500	386700	The Man Who Would Be Queen
386700	387700	3.
387700	388700	The Man Who Would Be Queen
388700	391220	Blanchard's theory likely would have been glanced at by a handful of sexologists before
391220	395680	fading into the endless sea of forgotten academic publications had it not been given
395680	401140	a major publicity boost by J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern psychology professor who endorsed
401140	406380	Blanchard's theory in a 2003 pop science book titled The Man Who Would Be Queen.
406380	407840	Great cover, Bailey.
407840	411540	Very controversial, very provocative, very politically incorrect.
411540	412940	I have been triggered.
412940	413940	Well done.
413940	415580	Now Bailey, I read your book, which, considering how much I enjoy your cream, is a very controversial,
415580	416580	very provocative, very politically incorrect, I have been triggered.
416580	417580	Well done.
417700	419500	The Man Who Would Be Queen was just amazingly bad.
419500	423360	The Man Who Would Be Queen is a frightening book for trans women because it's acutely
423360	427860	transphobic but also kind of vivid and well written, and it introduced a wide audience
427860	429400	to Blanchard's typology.
429400	433620	The first two parts of the book describe homosexual transsexuals, including Bailey's and his
433620	438540	male research assistant's observations that they're super fuckable and natural-born sex
438540	439540	workers.
439540	444380	I start upstairs to get the panoramic view and I see Kim for the first time on the stairs
444380	445380	dancing, posing.
445380	446380	She is spectacular.
446380	447380	She is spectacular.
447700	448700	She is spectacular.
448700	449700	Exotic.
449700	452700	I find out later that she is from Belize.
452700	454660	And sexy.
454660	460200	Her body is incredibly curvaceous, which is a clue that it may not be natural.
460200	467720	And I notice a very subtle and not unattractive angularity of the face, which is also not clearly
467720	471060	diagnostic on this tall siren.
471060	476140	It is difficult to avoid viewing Kim from two perspectives.
476140	477140	As a researcher.
477140	482140	But also as a single heterosexual man.
482140	484700	Wow Bailey, great science writing.
484700	489140	When he's done drooling all over the homosexual transsexuals, Bailey moves on to the autogynephilic
489140	494140	transsexuals, focusing almost entirely on a single case study of a trans woman he calls
494140	499140	Cher, whose backstory is a stomach-churning nightmare of autoerotic mania and transvestic
499140	500140	masturbation.
500140	505140	Bailey describes how Cher made videos of herself wearing female masks and vaginal prostheses,
505140	506140	while receiving anal sex from a sex worker.
506140	507140	Bailey says she has been able to get her anal sex from a sex robot of her own construction,
507140	508140	all to the accompaniment of a Donna Summers album and the moaning audio from a porno film.
508140	509140	It honestly sounds like something I would do in a video as a joke.
509140	510140	So well done Bailey, you've found an honest-to-god pervert.
510140	511140	And look, as a performance artist, I love the sex robot.
511140	512140	I admire it, I want it in my life.
512140	513140	But as a transsexual, I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.
513140	514140	You just found a person who built a sex robot.
514140	515140	That's not helpful.
515140	516140	I'm sorry.
516140	517140	I'm sorry.
517140	518140	I'm sorry.
518140	519140	I'm sorry.
519140	520140	I'm sorry.
520140	521140	I'm sorry.
521140	522140	I'm sorry.
522140	523140	I'm sorry.
523140	524140	I'm sorry.
524140	525140	I'm sorry.
525140	526140	I'm sorry.
526140	527140	I'm sorry.
527140	530240	I mean, Bailey, this has nothing to do with being trans.
530240	535740	You just found a- You just found a person who built a sex robot!
535740	537560	That's not how Bailey sees it, though.
537560	542080	He upholds Cher as an exemplary case of an autogynephiliac transsexual, claiming that
542080	546600	Cher's sexual fetishism is typical of the motivations of all trans women who aren't
546600	548420	exclusively attracted to men.
548420	553060	So Bailey's telling is that autogynephiles are these unfeminine male masturbators showing
553060	556080	up to gender clinics with bogus stories of how they always knew they
556080	560320	women in order to get genital reassignment surgery to satisfy their paraphilia.
560320	564240	Now what's striking about this to me is even for a defense of Blanchard's theory,
564240	567440	Bailey's account is more lurid and grotesque than it needs to be.
567440	571280	Bailey likes to think of himself as a dangerous libertine philosopher,
571280	573680	pursuing the light of truth wherever it may lead,
573680	577120	unrestrained by conventional morality and political correctness alike.
577120	578960	You're so filthy.
578960	581840	But what does the unrestrained pursuit of truth look like?
581840	584640	What objective methodologies does Bailey employ?
584640	588560	Well, for the most part, it seems like he just goes to gay bars in Chicago
588560	592480	and chats up trans women, turning these stories into case studies for his book.
592480	595520	Sounds like an awful lot of fun for scientific research.
595520	597360	You need a research assistant, Bailey?
597360	600240	The Man Who Would Be Queen is filled with sentences like,
600240	607760	There is no way to say this as sensitively as I would prefer, so I'll just go ahead.
608320	610480	All right, you edgy fuck, let's hear it.
611120	614400	Most homosexual transsexuals are
614400	614640	most
614640	618960	much better looking than most autogynephilic transsexuals.
619600	622240	We appreciate the feedback, Bailey, we really do.
622240	623760	But is this science?
623760	626960	It's effectively a straight cis man announcing his discovery
626960	630000	that young straight chicks are hotter than middle-aged lesbians
630000	633040	and trying to pass it off as a valid empirical observation.
633040	636560	And like the pop science cishet men have written over the past century
636560	639360	regarding the nature of females and homosexuals,
639360	643920	their observations about trans women are seriously lacking some vital perspectives.
643920	644400	This is what
644400	648960	we postmodernists mean when we complain that science often privileges a white,
648960	650640	cishet male perspective.
650640	653360	It's not that I hate men or male sexuality,
653360	658800	I just hate that the male sexual perspective is so powerful that it gets to call itself science.
658800	660800	It's not that there is no objective truth,
660800	663920	it's that this represents a very narrow window on it.
663920	666480	Wouldn't anyone care to hear a different perspective?
666480	667920	Well, how about mine?
670560	671360	Four.
671360	672560	My perspective.
672560	674240	From my perspective, Michael,
674240	676320	Bailey is a lecherous edgelord.
676320	678960	He's a man who, when I was a student at Northwestern,
678960	681760	was mostly famous for the fucksaw incident.
681760	682560	Google it.
682560	686080	Of course, that doesn't mean that the fundamental claims of his book aren't true.
686080	689360	Even if we could prove that Bailey gets together every weekend with Blanchard
689360	691920	to sacrifice a trans baby to Beelzebub,
691920	695840	it would still have no bearing on the scientific correctness of the theory,
695840	697280	which might still be true.
697280	699360	The problem is, it isn't true,
699360	701120	which I'll argue at length in a moment.
701120	704080	But first, it's worth noting that the theory has gained acceptance,
704080	706960	among a non-trivial number of academics and journalists.
706960	708400	Largely because, one,
708400	711840	it's often presented as the only supposedly scientific alternative
711840	714720	to mushy platitudes about women born in men's bodies,
714720	715440	and two,
715440	718080	many trans women have reacted to Bailey and Blanchard
718080	720400	with extreme vitriol and personal attacks,
720400	724160	resulting in the widespread perception that a bunch of triggered PC cucks
724160	727280	are throwing a narcissistic male-entitlement temper tantrum
727280	731360	because Bailey and Blanchard accurately call them out as paraphilic fetishists.
731360	733840	In her 2015 book, Galileo's Middle Finger,
733840	737440	bioethicist Alice Drager championed Bailey as the undeserving victim
737440	739760	of a hysterical SJW lynch mob.
739760	742080	But she gets so caught up in exonerating Bailey
742080	744000	of the personal accusations against him,
744000	746560	and in telling a bigger story about academic freedom
746560	749280	and how scientists are being silenced by PC cucks,
749280	752800	that she doesn't bother to check how good Bailey's science really is,
752800	755840	and ends up affirming the autogynephilia theory herself.
755840	758640	Now I'm certainly not gonna deny that trans people on the internet
758640	761440	can sometimes behave like a bit of an angry mob.
761440	763200	In fact, I may be on the receiving end
763200	765920	of one of those myself in about, oh, 20 minutes,
765920	767840	depending on how this video is received.
767840	770960	But there's not exactly a shortage of sleazy passive aggression
770960	772960	from the Blanchard and Bailey camp either.
772960	777200	Blanchard is known to seek out and comment on pornography made by his detractors,
777200	780160	and Drager is an advocate for the narcissistic rage theory
780160	782080	of trans backlash against Bailey.
782080	784640	Remember, according to autogynephilia theory,
784640	787520	many trans women are erotically fixated on themselves,
787520	790320	from which a dishonest person can make a conceptual leap
790320	792160	to saying that they're narcissists,
792160	792640	and hence,
792640	795360	any trans woman who raises her voice in this conversation
795360	800000	is accused of exhibiting narcissistic rage emanating from her wounded male ego.
800000	804160	Furthermore, like so many other professors in recent academic freedom controversies,
804160	808000	Blanchard and Bailey being ruthlessly silenced by PC cucks
808000	811040	has not really interfered with their academic careers,
811040	814800	nor their continued authority to misrepresent people with less power than them.
814800	819680	This is of course assuming that autogynephilia really is a misrepresentation of trans women,
819680	822400	and that's really the crux of this whole drama, isn't it?
822400	826000	So let's just leave the drama behind and dive right into that question,
826000	827760	pursuing the pure light of truth,
827760	829440	as we always do on this channel,
829440	830800	relying only on the facts,
830800	831520	the figures,
831520	832960	the scientific studies.
832960	833760	Just kidding.
833760	837120	If you really want to read a scientific argument against autogynephilia,
837120	838880	read Julia Serrano's article,
838880	840640	The Case Against Autogynephilia,
840640	842160	which pretty much sums it up.
842160	846320	Because I know that you didn't click on this video because you wanted to hear about science,
846320	848400	you came here because you wanted filth,
848400	850080	and I'll give you filth, Bailey.
850080	851680	I know that's what you want,
851680	853680	and I wanna give you what you want.
853680	855280	I wanna give it all up for you.
859840	862160	5. The False Dichotomy
862160	864080	Filth is coming, don't worry,
864080	867200	but before we get there there's one more thing we need to discuss.
867200	870640	Advocates of Blanchard's theory pretty much unanimously introduce it
870640	873600	as if it were the only possible alternative to what's called
873600	875520	The Feminine Essence Theory.
875520	880000	The Feminine Essence Theory says that trans women are female souls and male bodies,
880000	881680	that we are women from birth to death,
881680	886020	path, and that transition is merely an effort to make our accidental exterior match our
886020	887600	essential interior.
887600	894000	People like Draeger will tell you that TRANSACTIVISTS dogmatically adhere to this theory, and that
894000	897440	anyone who challenges it will be pursued by a ruthless witch hunt.
897440	901480	And of course, the only way to challenge it, we're told, is to defer to Blanchard's
901480	905240	typology of homosexual and autogynephilic transsexuals.
905240	909440	Now I object to this framing of the discussion, because I don't believe in Blanchard's
909440	912060	typology or the feminine essence theory.
912060	915320	There is no feminine singularity that made me a woman from birth.
915320	917160	I wasn't born a woman.
917160	921240	I was born a fucking baby, just like everyone else.
921240	924780	There's no such thing as a feminine essence or a masculine essence.
924780	929640	There's only biology, habitual behavior, and the way society responds to you, all of which
929640	933620	can be changed quite a lot, and all of which are currently changing for me.
933620	936660	Now there is an emotional appeal to the feminine essence theory.
936660	939440	I think most people have gender essentialist intuition.
939440	945060	And I admit I do feel, on some level, that I'm supposed to be a woman by nature.
945060	946900	And in a sense that may be true.
946900	950940	I don't think I chose to be trans, and it seems likely that there's something inherent
950940	954520	in my biology or psychology that led me to transition.
954520	959000	But that's not quite the same thing as essential womanhood, which intellectually I don't
959000	960180	think makes sense.
960180	962080	I think it's heartwarming gibberish.
962080	967220	But there is also, I think, a legitimate role in the discourse for heartwarming gibberish.
967220	969060	Sometimes you have to explain what it means to be trans.
969060	972660	To a person who believes that dogs go to heaven.
972660	978120	And in most circumstances, saying I'm a female soul in a male body gets the point across.
978120	980280	Not all language is philosophical.
980280	984220	It's a lot easier to explain what being trans is in essentialist terms.
984220	988820	To explain it without gender essentialism requires a whole complicated philosophical
988820	992240	discussion that most people simply aren't up to having.
992240	996320	But the useful platitudes become a problem when more analytically-minded people start
996320	998400	putting these things under the microscope.
998400	1001940	And then they end up concluding that trans people are just fetishists who are telling
1001940	1003440	lies about themselves.
1003440	1007580	So you're probably wondering, if I'm not a fetishist, and not essentially a woman,
1007580	1008580	then why am I transitioning?
1008580	1013640	Well, I keep saying this, but dysphoria really was the primary reason.
1013640	1017880	And shortly before I transitioned, I made a whole video about that, if you're curious.
1017880	1021080	You have to keep in mind that transitioning is not just for the bedroom.
1021080	1024860	When you decide you're going to live as a woman, you have to do that at the grocery
1024860	1026400	store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with your family.
1026400	1027400	You have to do that at the grocery store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner with
1027400	1028400	your family.
1028400	1029400	You have to do that at the grocery store and on airplanes and at Thanksgiving dinner
1029400	1030400	with your family, if you even still have a family.
1030400	1035080	It's kind of hard for me to imagine why someone would do that just to gratify a masturbatory
1035080	1036080	urge.
1036080	1039880	That said, is there some sexual aspect of being transgender?
1039880	1044160	Well of course there goddamn is, how could an adult decide to switch genders without
1044160	1046260	there being some connection to sexuality?
1046260	1050780	The problem is, autogynephilia is not a good description of that connection in most cases,
1050780	1053200	and it certainly isn't in my case.
1053200	1057400	But I'm a 29-year-old transsexual with a history of dating women and cross-dressing
1057400	1059760	in erotic situations, no less.
1059760	1062920	According to Blanchard's theory, I'm therefore an autogynephile.
1062920	1065400	It seems that I have some explaining to do.
1065400	1068400	Well, here's where the filth comes in.
1068400	1069400	6.
1069400	1071520	Contrapoints in erotic life
1071520	1075400	Come one, come all to the gender circus with your host Natalie.
1075400	1077580	Step right up, you filthy freaks.
1077580	1081440	One of the reasons it's difficult for trans women to refute Blanchard's theory is that
1081440	1086080	even arguing against it from your own experience is incredibly humiliating and degrading and
1086080	1087080	invalidating.
1087080	1091360	Unfortunately, I have no sense of self-respect or dignity whatsoever, so I'm willing to take
1091360	1092640	one for the team here.
1092640	1094300	Get your clipboards out, gentlemen!
1094300	1099080	I want to make this as easy as possible for the psychoanalysts at home.
1099080	1101520	I was born in 1988.
1101520	1105960	As a small child, I was not especially feminine nor especially masculine.
1105960	1111040	I was not interested in sports, and was just kind of physically inept.
1111040	1114840	My main childhood interest was music, and I learned several instruments.
1114840	1116960	In early adolescence, I was misdiagnosed with OCD.
1116960	1122580	The primary symptoms being spending too much time in the shower, and spending too much
1122580	1124200	time styling my hair.
1124200	1126200	My sexual development was kind of late.
1126200	1129160	I never masturbated till I was 15.
1129160	1134340	And I didn't fantasize about having sex with women, or with men, or even about becoming
1134340	1135340	a woman.
1135340	1138040	My fantasies were kind of platonic, almost.
1138040	1142740	I would sort of fantasize about women, but in a very abstract kind of way.
1142740	1146920	An early romantic disappointment involved my realization that women would never be a
1146920	1147920	woman.
1147920	1150960	They would be attracted to me in the same way that I was attracted to them.
1150960	1155520	In my late teens and early twenties, I was a long-haired, smooth-chested androgyne, which
1155520	1156680	suited me well.
1156680	1161360	It was around then that I first cross-dressed, when a woman I was seeing asked if she could
1161360	1164540	dress me up in her clothes, and do my makeup.
1164540	1167320	God yes, I said.
1167320	1171040	Throughout my twenties, I was on and off in relationships where there was this feminization
1171040	1172120	dynamic.
1172120	1175340	More women are into feminizing boys than you might think.
1175340	1176300	When I was feminized, it would just be me.
1176300	1179880	When I was feminized, we would just make out and not do anything penetrative, but just
1179880	1183120	sort of little proto-lesbian things, you know?
1183120	1187480	Now some women I was with were not into that, and some would practically lock their underwear
1187480	1189940	drawers when they found out I had done it in the past.
1189940	1194100	There was one period where I cut my hair short and quit that altogether, but it didn't last
1194100	1195820	more than a couple years.
1195820	1200780	When I had regular heterosexual sex, it was like my soul had to leave my body in order
1200780	1203620	for me to get the poison out, which is how I thought of it.
1203620	1205300	The cross-dressing was never a solo or a masturbatory activity.
1205300	1210180	There was always a partner, or sometimes several partners.
1210180	1212480	Bailey, are you paying attention to this?
1212480	1213560	This is for you.
1213560	1217620	What I liked about it was the way that dressing like a woman changed the way partners interacted
1217620	1220760	with my body, how they would kind of treat me like a woman.
1220760	1225060	I fully acknowledge that a lot of the feminization was pretty fetishistic.
1225060	1231060	There was a lot of short dresses and thigh highs, and occasionally also a BDSM submissive
1231060	1232160	aspect.
1232160	1233200	But over time, I realized that the fetish aspect wasn't really what I liked about it.
1233200	1234200	I didn't like it.
1234200	1235200	I didn't like it.
1235200	1235280	I didn't like it.
1235300	1236300	I didn't like it.
1236300	1237300	I didn't like it.
1237300	1238300	I didn't like it.
1238300	1239300	It wasn't humiliating for me to be feminized.
1239300	1240300	It was affirming.
1240300	1244740	And one day, I kind of realized that I didn't want to be feminized at all.
1244740	1247140	I wanted to be feminine.
1247140	1251440	In my mid-twenties, I first started really paying attention to trans women and thinking
1251440	1256240	about transitioning myself, but I thought that, since I didn't feel like a woman, that
1256240	1260180	I never would, and I thought that I would never pass and that I would just be a hideous
1260180	1261840	parody of womanhood.
1261840	1265200	Then about a year ago, thanks to this amazing online queer community that we have now, I
1265200	1268800	started developing more positive thinking about this.
1268800	1272840	I've always looked a little bit younger than my age, but last year I also started noticing
1272840	1277860	the first signs that I was going to age into the body of an older man, and that triggered
1277860	1279920	really intense gender dysphoria.
1279920	1283820	At the same time, I realized that I would have to transition to have any hope of a genuinely
1283820	1285260	fulfilling sex life.
1285260	1289240	And at that point, the need to transition felt so urgent that I could not wait.
1289240	1294200	So I got internet hormones from the Republic of Vanuatu, and I started taking those in
1294200	1298460	August until I could get a prescription from an informed consent clinic.
1298460	1301340	And since then, my life has drastically changed.
1301340	1305880	I live as a woman full-time now, and most of the changes aren't sexual, but the hormones
1305880	1308140	certainly do have sexual effects.
1308140	1313880	I now find myself attracted to both women and men, and the mere visual image of a woman
1313880	1316880	no longer turns me on the way it did.
1316880	1320900	Instead, I need there to be a certain kind of interpersonal connection.
1320900	1323640	I don't masturbate at all, and I haven't come in months.
1323640	1325400	Someone, please fuck me.
1325400	1330020	I guess the critical thing is that I've been wearing women's clothes, my clothes, for seven
1330020	1334820	consecutive months, and I have been turned on by it for zero percent of the time.
1334820	1338580	So the idea that I'm some kind of transvestite fetishist is ridiculous.
1338580	1342080	And I'm not turned on by the mere idea of having a female body either.
1342080	1344920	I mean, when there's developments, I'll check it out.
1344920	1347700	But I'm not like, oh yeah, I have tits now, that's so hot.
1347700	1350000	I mean, it's kind of hot.
1350000	1353640	But it's more about other people being into it than it is about me.
1353640	1354700	Being into it.
1354700	1358300	So as always, my sex drive is directed outward at other people.
1358300	1362880	The sexual aspect of my transsexuality is not about the target of lust being directed
1362880	1363980	inward.
1363980	1369640	It's about me wanting my sexual encounters to occur from the standpoint of a female body.
1369640	1372120	Or, you know, at least as close as I can get.
1372120	1376580	And since I started hormones, it's about my sexual desires coming from this psychologically
1376580	1382520	female place of vague bisexual interest activated by interpersonal connection.
1382520	1383520	Rather than being a woman.
1383520	1388060	Rather than intense, object-oriented male lust.
1388060	1392360	So that's my attempt to describe my sexual history without resorting to politically correct
1392360	1396440	cuckoldry or trans ideology.
1396440	1399960	Now I've read enough Blanchard to know that this description in no way lets me off the
1399960	1400960	hook for autogynephilia.
1400960	1407860	In fact, I'm what Blanchard would call a classic case of pseudobisexual behavioral autogynephilia.
1407860	1413020	Pseudobisexual because of course all trans women's experiences are lies, and because,
1413020	1417080	according to Blanchard, I only like guys because being filled up with their dicks makes
1417080	1419800	me feel like a girl, which is what I'm really into.
1419800	1424900	And behavioral because Blanchard describes different kinds of autogynephilia, like anatomic,
1424900	1429700	transvestic, behavioral, and physiological, according to what you supposedly fetishize.
1429700	1434320	And I'm turned on by sexually behaving like a woman, rather than simply wearing female
1434320	1436320	clothes or having female anatomy.
1436320	1441020	And I mean, okay, you can slap a Greek word on anything and make it sound scary, fake,
1441020	1442020	and pathological.
1442020	1443020	But I think this isn't a sense of reality.
1443020	1448020	It's an especially unfair way to characterize my experience, and here's why.
1448020	1450740	7.
1450740	1451740	Autophilia in general
1451740	1455680	I'm guessing that most people would be pretty reluctant to admit that they take any kind
1455680	1457980	of sexual interest in their own bodies.
1457980	1460840	It's sort of like admitting that you enjoy your own body odor.
1460840	1461840	Ew.
1461840	1464380	But how unusual is it to check yourself out?
1464380	1467980	To take some sexual interest in the sight or touch of your own body?
1467980	1472280	I've noticed that cis men seem to really like their own penises.
1472280	1476560	And taking pictures of their penises and sending them to other people.
1476560	1479140	Does that make them autoandrophiles?
1479140	1482000	Are they behavioral autophallophiles?
1482000	1484000	I can make up Greek words too, Blanchard.
1484000	1488640	I know a cis woman who, having just bought some expensive lingerie, told me,
1488640	1491160	It's not for men, it's for me.
1491160	1492160	What does that mean?
1492160	1497000	It means she enjoyed wearing sexy lingerie under her clothes because it made her feel
1497000	1498000	hot.
1498000	1500000	Is that cisvestic autogynephilia?
1500000	1501000	Likewise.
1501000	1505900	I used to date cis women, I know what they do, and I can tell you that women touching
1505900	1510640	their own breasts during sex or while masturbating is not at all uncommon.
1510640	1513060	Is that anatomical autogynephilia?
1513060	1518160	Twitter user Nathan of Oz pointed out that in the October 2017 issue of Cosmo, an article
1518160	1523620	on self-love tips recommends that its apparently cis female readers try stroking their own
1523620	1528980	feet or running a feather over their skin as a prelude to kneeling in front of a full-length
1528980	1530520	mirror and rubbing one out.
1530520	1533620	Possibly while squatting on a dildo.
1533620	1537480	Can you imagine the level of paraphilic male fetishism that would be read into this if
1537480	1539000	it was written by a trans woman?
1539000	1542720	I mean it's one step away from filming yourself fucking a sex robot.
1542720	1547480	And okay, Cosmo's sex advice is often ludicrous, but the point is, it seems like it's only
1547480	1551740	when it comes to trans women that we feel the need to whip out the suffix "-philia".
1551740	1556340	It seems what's going on here is a lot of pathologizing of normal female sexuality when
1556340	1558280	it exists in trans women.
1558280	1559420	But of course that raises the question, what is transphilia?
1559420	1560420	What is transphilia?
1560520	1563020	What is normal female sexuality?
1563020	1565980	8.
1565980	1569600	Normal Female Sexuality Switching from male to female hormones causes
1569600	1574220	your sex drive to be completely obliterated and then regrown in new form, which came as
1574220	1576620	more of a relief to me than I expected.
1576620	1581400	I don't think I realized the extent to which my own sexuality felt like a demonic possession
1581400	1585500	or alien infection until I was free of it, thank god.
1585500	1589660	When I had male hormones in me I needed to have an orgasm like every day, I was turned
1589660	1594820	on mainly by visual arousal cues, I was at a Kinsey 1 relative to my birth sex, and I
1594820	1600760	had a couple mild, typical, straight guy paraphilic kinks, no, not autogynephilia.
1600760	1604760	On female hormones I initially had no sex drive at all, but have started developing
1604760	1606960	very different patterns of arousal.
1606960	1612340	For instance, I never need to have an orgasm, I'm turned on mainly by interpersonal cues
1612340	1618000	like intimate physical contact or close emotional moments, I'm at around a 70-30 attraction
1618000	1619500	to women vs men.
1619500	1622220	And the paraphilic kinks have vanished without a trace.
1622220	1627840	Oh by the way, for the pharmacologists at home, this is 6mg estradiol and 200mg spironolactone
1627840	1628840	daily.
1628840	1633300	So my interpretation of all this is that I have what is a pretty typical female sexuality,
1633300	1635020	at least for a girl who's into girls.
1635020	1640360	I don't feel like I have some essentially male, pseudo-bisexual, behavioral autogynephilia.
1640360	1644300	One of the reasons why Blanchard has to come up with elaborate terminology like this is
1644300	1648800	he takes as foundational the presupposition that trans women are psychologically more like
1648800	1650540	cis men than cis women.
1650540	1655020	His studies therefore lack a cis female control group, meaning he didn't bother to apply
1655020	1657600	his autogynephilia survey to cis women.
1657600	1661980	But if he had, as Charles Moser did in 2009, he might have found that many of them were
1661980	1664140	classified as autogynephilic.
1664140	1669560	Blanchard's insistence on classifying trans women's sexuality as a variant on male sexuality
1669560	1674640	makes it seem paraphilic and unusual that trans women want to have sex as women.
1674640	1677140	But what do cis women want to have sex as?
1677140	1678140	Walruses?
1678140	1679720	I mean, no judgements.
1679720	1685900	This also explains his claim that non-exclusively androphilic trans women are pseudo-bisexual
1685900	1689920	because their attraction to men does not resemble gay male attraction to men.
1689920	1695460	The idea is that these trans women's attraction to men is not based on raw physical lust,
1695460	1700560	so it is therefore unlike gay male attraction to men, and is therefore pseudo.
1700560	1705180	That is, it's really an autogynephilic fantasy where the man is just a prop.
1705180	1707880	But what about straight cis women's attraction to men?
1707880	1711460	Is that based on raw physical lust for the male body?
1711460	1716200	I mean, sometimes it probably is, and I'm not a cis woman so I can't really say.
1716200	1722700	But I kind of suspect that cis female heterosexuality is not best described as raw physical lust
1722700	1724160	for the male body.
1724160	1729200	That is, I suspect it's quite different from cis male homosexuality, if I may risk
1729200	1731040	painting with broad strokes.
1731040	1735560	Take the case of Playgirl magazine, which at its peak published feminist articles alongside
1735560	1736560	Naked Hunks but never had the circulation of a trans woman.
1736560	1737560	It's not a real thing.
1737560	1740400	It's more of a representation of its male counterpart, and later on ended up just being
1740400	1741980	read by gay men.
1741980	1746240	From the perspective of female sexuality, I mean, men's bodies are nice, they have
1746240	1750860	great hands, great abs, great this part, it's all great.
1750860	1752460	But it's not that great.
1752460	1756420	And if you read pornography written by women, and notice that it's usually written and
1756420	1761840	not photographed, you don't find a predominant focus on vivid descriptions of male bodies.
1761840	1766300	Like in Fifty Shades of Grey, which I read for research purposes, there's some description
1767560	1770880	of male bodies, but it's not the main thing by any means.
1770880	1772960	There's a lot more sentences like,
1772960	1777560	To the right is an imposing U-shaped sofa that could seat ten adults comfortably.
1777560	1782620	It faces a state-of-the-art stainless steel, or maybe platinum for all I know.
1782620	1783980	Modern fireplace.
1783980	1789160	Near the kitchen area, in front of the glass wall, is a dining table surrounded by sixteen
1789160	1790160	chairs.
1790160	1794560	And tucked in the corner is a full-sized, shiny black grand piano.
1794560	1797440	Here, he hands me a glass of wine.
1797440	1801620	Even the glasses are rich, heavy, contemporary crystal.
1801620	1803340	It's like a Crate and Barrel catalog.
1803340	1804980	I'm getting so wet.
1804980	1809960	Christian is established as a man of good taste, as evinced by his contemporary crystal,
1809960	1815280	his playing Bach at the piano, and that's hot, because it's sexy to be wanted by someone
1815280	1816600	who's qualified.
1816600	1819720	It's not enough to be whistled at by a cat caller, they have no discernment.
1819720	1823200	I mean, they whistle at anything that looks vaguely female.
1823200	1824200	They whistle at me.
1824200	1825760	And I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.
1825760	1826760	I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.
1826760	1826960	I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.
1827440	1828440	I don't want to be whistled at by the kind of person who would whistle at me.
1828440	1832320	You want to be wanted by someone who, with their exquisite and discriminating taste,
1832320	1834400	selects you, the protagonist.
1834400	1838360	This is not a story about Christian's rippling abs and his tight buns.
1838360	1840880	It's not a story about wanting a man.
1840880	1844160	It's a story about being wanted by a man.
1844160	1846440	This is how the whole romance genre works.
1846440	1851020	You emotionally identify with the female protagonist, then you meet the sexy bad boy who's like
1851020	1856560	a pirate or the CEO of Business Incorporated, and then the hot part is just how badly this
1856560	1856760	guy wants you.
1856760	1862460	The protagonist, usually singling her out over other more qualified women, and eventually
1862460	1865940	giving up everything he loves to settle down and make babies with her.
1865940	1868160	And a lot of these stories are kind of silly.
1868160	1872340	They conflate female sexuality with women's economic dependence on men in a way that's
1872340	1878660	really problematic, but I fundamentally resonate with the wish to be wanted.
1878660	1882000	I want other people to think I'm sexy and want to fuck me, you know?
1882000	1885540	It makes me feel like I have value, and it fills up the void inside.
1885540	1886540	Is that so wrong?
1886760	1890080	9.
1890080	1891320	Female Vanity
1891320	1896100	The art critic John Berger wrote in his book Ways of Seeing about the European oil painting
1896100	1901400	trope of depainting a nude woman with a mirror and calling the painting vanity.
1901400	1904940	The mirror was often used as a symbol of the vanity of woman.
1904940	1907680	The moralizing, however, was mostly hypocritical.
1907680	1911060	You painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her.
1911060	1915420	You put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting vanity, thus morally condemning
1915420	1916560	the woman whose nakedness you despise.
1916560	1916600	9.
1916600	1917880	Female Vanity
1917880	1920700	The real function of the mirror was otherwise.
1920700	1925900	It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.
1925900	1931480	The notion of the vanity of woman is a misogynistic trope that originates in male projection.
1931480	1936280	It is the assumption that women enjoy looking at themselves in the same way that men enjoy
1936280	1940180	looking at them, and are hence complicit in their own objectification.
1940180	1944820	I think the concept of the autogynephilic transsexual woman is a combination of this
1944820	1945920	trope with a homophobic trope.
1945920	1952800	Misogyny casts women as narcissistic, vain, in love with themselves, and homophobia casts
1952800	1955280	queer men as hypersexual perverts.
1955280	1960080	The autogynephile is the ultimate combination of the two, the hypersexual pervert vainly
1960080	1962760	in love with the image of himself as a woman.
1962760	1963760	10.
1963760	1970000	Autogynephilia is a misogynistic trope that originates in the image of a woman.
1970000	1974840	It is a misogynistic trope that originates in the image of a woman.
1974840	1975800	10.
1975800	1977360	Autogynephilia is the ultimate combination of the two, the autogynephilia and the paraphilia
1977360	1978360	acceptance.
1978360	1981120	So this whole video I've been treating autogynephilia kind of like an accusation, from which I have
1981120	1982820	to exonerate myself.
1982820	1987120	And I think it's justifiable considering I'm objecting to misrepresentation, but some people
1987120	1992520	might wonder isn't this whole conversation getting kind of kink-shame-y, like, is autogynephilia
1992520	1993520	so wrong?
1993520	1995520	Well, no, it's not.
1995520	1996680	It's fine.
1996680	2000320	There definitely are men who get turned on by wearing women's clothes or thinking about
2000320	2005120	having a female body, and as paraphilias go, this is very harmless, and I don't think it's
2005120	2009100	anything to be ashamed of. But the question of whether genuinely autogynephilic trans women
2009100	2014520	exist is more complicated. The reason most trans women consider the label autogynephilia to be such
2014520	2020920	a stigma is that, as Blanchard says, women do not get turned on merely by the thought of being women.
2021160	2025960	Now as I've discussed, the problem with Blanchard is he overextends the concept of autogynephilia
2025960	2031420	to cover pretty much any sexual feeling a cluster B trans woman can have. But I'm actually inclined
2031420	2036900	to agree with him that being turned on merely by the thought of being a woman is a fundamentally
2036900	2041640	non-female state of mind, and one that feels quite foreign to me. So a lot of trans women,
2041780	2046540	I guess including me, have the idea that you can't be both a woman and an autogynephile,
2046820	2051220	hence the offense we take to being characterized in this way. However, things get messier when
2051220	2055560	you look into this some more. Are there some genuinely autogynephilic transsexuals?
2055940	2060440	Well, at first glance, the answer is yes. I mean, there's always one, isn't there?
2060440	2061400	In this case, though,
2061420	2066560	one is Anne Lawrence, a disciple of Blanchard and self-identified autogynephilic transsexual.
2066860	2073520	From 1998 to 2011, Lawrence collected 249 anonymous accounts of autogynephilia over the internet
2073520	2080020	and published them in her 2012 book, Men Trapped in Men's Bodies. Great title, Anne. Very provocative,
2080380	2086080	very controversial, very politically incorrect. I have been triggered. Well done. What is this
2086080	2090220	cover, though? Come on, Anne. Get a statue of hermaphroditus or something on there.
2090220	2091400	So this book is filled with a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff. It's a lot of stuff.
2091400	2095660	It's a lot of the stories of trans women who have a past or present of pretty autogynephilia-like
2095660	2101700	fantasy and behavior. So what do we make of that? Well, a lot of this stuff, like fantasies of being
2101700	2106360	women or having sex as women or arousal during cross-dressing, are what the trans community
2106360	2111700	has destigmatizingly termed cross-sex gender fantasy. And among trans women, particularly
2111700	2117540	prior to transition, this kind of thing is pretty common. You'll see it all over the place on trans
2117540	2121380	subreddits. There's a blog called CrossDreamers devoted to it. There's a blog called CrossDreamers
2121400	2125180	devoted to it. It's been written about by Zinnia Jones and Giulia Serrano. So within the trans
2125180	2130160	community, this isn't even controversial. It's not provocative. It's not politically incorrect.
2130600	2134660	But how do we make sense of this? Well, my thinking is that it's pretty hard to experience
2134660	2139460	genuine female sexuality when you've still got the evil magic of testosterone in your system.
2139820	2144380	So you've got to get that out, and then this paraphilic stuff tends to go away. But how is
2144380	2148800	this any different from Blanchard's theory of autogynephilia? Well, basically, it comes down to
2148800	2151380	this. Blanchard's theory claims that cross-dressing is a form of sexism. It's a form of sexism. It's a
2151400	2156880	gender fantasy or arousal is causal and essential. In this theory, if you're an autogynephilic
2156880	2162440	transsexual, you are essentially male, and any facsimile of womanhood you achieve can only be
2162440	2167980	honestly understood as the expression of an essentially male sexual urge. I reject the idea
2167980	2172420	that it's causal or essential, and I think the strongest piece of evidence that it isn't essential
2172420	2177840	is that even the rare trans women who identify as autogynephilic admit that after transition,
2177840	2180400	the cross-sex fantasy and arousal vanishes,
2180400	2185360	yet they continue to prefer living as trans women. Blanchard made this observation himself.
2210400	2220720	If these trans women are essentially men with a paraphilic desire to become women, why would they
2220720	2225940	continue preferring to live as women after the paraphilic desires go away? Well, this is where
2225940	2230840	things get really weird. According to Blanchard and Lawrence, the only way to explain this is to
2230840	2235760	shift the goalpost and say that actually, autogynephilia isn't a paraphilia at all.
2235760	2240360	It's actually a sexual orientation. So what happens when you transition is you
2240400	2246080	actually pair-bond with yourself, forming a kind of stale, sexless marriage with the woman you've
2246080	2251280	become. And if that sounds like it doesn't make any goddamn sense at all, it's because it doesn't.
2251280	2255920	A pair-bond is a social relationship between two or more people. Are you saying that trans women
2255920	2260960	are a man and a woman inside this- why do they continue falling in love with other people-
2260960	2264560	I can't even start with this. This video is too long, I'm getting cranky. Look, this seems like
2264560	2270400	the point where Occam's Razor shuts down Blanchard's theory. Like, okay, maybe I subconsciously created
2270400	2275920	a female alter-ego with which my original male ego has fallen in love. But maybe lots of things.
2275920	2281200	Maybe I subconsciously want to become my mother so I can fuck my father. Maybe the elder gods ripped
2281200	2286400	my primordial duality in twain, and now I'm yearning for my female half. Or maybe I'm just
2286400	2289120	a woman who wants someone to fuck me every once in a while.
2291120	2293680	11. True autogynephiles
2293680	2298480	Among the narratives recorded in Lawrence's book, there are, admittedly, a few accounts of trans
2298480	2300320	women whose primary sexuality is the same as that of a woman who has a male ego. And that's because
2300320	2304000	a woman's sexuality and motivation throughout their transition does appear to be genuinely
2304000	2308480	autogynephilic. And I'm not gonna say that these people are lying about their experiences,
2308480	2314080	because that would be a terrible thing to do. Ultimately, ContraPoints is not a channel about
2314080	2319200	judging people, so I'm not gonna say that these people aren't really trans. I mean, I find it
2319200	2325200	weird and hard to imagine, but whatever. I'm the one who's into people licking milk off my tits.
2325200	2329680	And wait till you see my sex robot. And look, if I had autogynephilic feelings,
2329680	2333920	I would just tell you. I've already admitted to things in this video that I wouldn't tell my own
2333920	2339360	diary on my deathbed. But I just don't. This theory doesn't describe my conscious motivations
2339360	2343600	to transition. And that's ultimately the reason most trans women hate this theory,
2343600	2347520	not because of wounded narcissism or shattered erotic delusions. We just
2347520	2351280	don't like being misrepresented. But you know who does love this theory?
2353040	2355120	She's been there literally the whole time.
2355120	2359360	You know, I realize that by talking about this, I'm subjecting myself to a lot of ruthless,
2359360	2364080	psychoanalysis. Whether it's gonna come from TERF Reddit, or trans people who are mad at me for
2364080	2370000	even talking about this, or who knows, maybe even Blanchard and Bailey themselves. So you know what,
2370000	2374560	why don't we just get that out of the way right now. It's time to put this tranny on trial.
2375200	2378320	12. The Autogynephilia Trial of ContraPoints
2379520	2384160	All rise. The Autogynephilia Department of the Sexology Court is now in session.
2384160	2385520	Judge Bailey presiding.
2386560	2389200	Calling the case of the gender-critical subreddit versus
2389360	2391520	ContraPoints. Are both sides ready?
2393520	2396320	District Attorney Cockbane, ready for the subreddit, Your Honor?
2397600	2398960	Ready, I guess.
2398960	2404160	Your Honor, ladies of the subreddit, the defendant is a man. A full-grown,
2404160	2407280	six-foot, wide-shouldered man in a dress.
2407280	2409200	It's really more of a hospital gown?
2409200	2413520	The evidence will show that the defendant is not a woman, but a male pervert,
2413520	2417040	role-playing as such, for his own twisted sexual amusement.
2417040	2418640	Abigail, what are you holding?
2418640	2420480	It's for horseback riding.
2420480	2424320	Your Honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following video clip,
2424320	2428240	uploaded to YouTube by the defendant on June 13th, 2016.
2438320	2439120	Oh, God.
2439120	2443920	Fishnets, garter belts, corsets. If these are not the trappings of an autogynephile,
2443920	2448400	then I don't have 2x chromosomes. Agreed. Well, what do you have to say for yourself?
2448640	2452080	Well, why do you think I had all that fetish stuff in the first place?
2452080	2455520	The court does not need to hear about your perverse masturbation rituals.
2455520	2457600	I bought that stuff for Rocky Horror.
2457600	2458320	What?
2458320	2462000	Rocky Horror Picture Show. I used to do Frankenfurter.
2462000	2465280	Your Honor, I'd like to admit into evidence the following photograph.
2465280	2469840	That's me at E Street Cinema in 2014. This one's on the house, Kiwi Farms.
2469840	2471840	Are you a Rocky Horror fan, Your Honor?
2471840	2472400	Am I?
2473200	2477600	It's just a jump to the left and take a step to the right.
2478960	2480240	Put your hands on your hips.
2481360	2486880	And bring your knees in tight. But it's the pelvic thrust.
2486880	2487600	Ew.
2487600	2490480	So you liked to dress up as another cross-dressing autogynephile.
2490480	2492240	How is that helping your case at all?
2492240	2496080	Well, I know Rocky Horror is problematic.
2496080	2497280	But when you're living as a man,
2497280	2501280	there aren't a lot of socially acceptable occasions to try out cross-dressing.
2501280	2504400	You know, it's basically Rocky Horror, Halloween,
2504400	2507680	pretty much any time it's socially allowed to be a freakish monster.
2507680	2508640	And come to think of it,
2508640	2513760	the scary monster autogynephile is a trope I've played with since the beginning of this channel.
2513760	2518320	The whole ContraPoints aesthetic is very like autogynephilia-chic.
2518320	2522640	I originally was going to have the narrator of this channel be more of a fictional character.
2522640	2526160	The idea was to be like autogynephile Harry Plinkett.
2526160	2528480	And part of that is that I kind of hated myself.
2528480	2530400	I thought I was just disgusting.
2530400	2533440	Part of it is that representing yourself as a scary monster
2533440	2536800	actually does capture something of the horror of gender dysphoria.
2536800	2538640	And part of it is that identifying with the horror of gender dysphoria,
2538640	2544520	with a scary monster version of yourself is actually kind of empowering, like cis feminists,
2544580	2549880	you have your thing about witches. Okay, but monster version or not, real women do not wear
2549880	2554340	fishnets and garter belts and corsets. This is just male fetishism. Well, it's true that cis
2554340	2559360	women generally don't dress that way, no. I mean, unless they're doing Rocky Horror, it's actually
2559360	2563640	pretty popular. But I never wear shit like that anymore. In fact, it actually causes gender
2563640	2567900	dysphoria because it makes me feel like a male cross-dresser. Sometimes trans women start out
2567900	2572760	with a fairly male conception of what women wear. I guess that's true. A lot of trans women
2572760	2577680	transition after a period of sort of trying things out as a cross-dresser or a drag queen.
2578020	2581860	But you know, it takes time to develop an authentic sense of female fashion. Like,
2581860	2583680	what did you wear when you were 14?
2589480	2594400	That's what I thought. But also, why not steal fashion ideas from drag queens and kinksters?
2594820	2597640	Cis women do. They have some good ideas. Without
2597640	2597880	drag queens and kinksters, they don't have any.
2597900	2602440	Without drag queens and kinksters, we'd have no contouring, no chokers. And what would we do then,
2602440	2606640	Abigail? What would we do then? I don't know what you would do. I think I could manage.
2606960	2609600	Your Honor, I would like to admit into evidence the following clip.
2610120	2615260	Is there a way to smash my ribs in? I'll smash them in. I'll smash the shit out of them.
2616380	2620000	These shoes are cute, and I'll finally be able to hit my head on the tops of door frames.
2621700	2627880	Would you fuck me? I wouldn't. Your Honor, the defendant literally tries on high heels and
2627900	2633480	corsets in front of a mirror before posing to himself the question, would you fuck me? This,
2633480	2636240	Your Honor, is peak trans.
2638760	2646920	How do we even need to have a trial about this? Well, that scene depicts a kind of anguish,
2647060	2651720	not sexual pleasure. Would you fuck me is obviously a reference to Silence of the Lambs,
2651960	2656920	and is what is known in the trans community as a joke. The corsets, the high heels, these were
2656920	2657840	primitive efforts.
2657840	2662300	at clawing my way out of manhood, and they're efforts that I've left behind. Now that I'm on
2662300	2667100	female hormones and I live this way full-time, I feel the way I'm supposed to feel, and I don't
2667100	2671480	need to lean on that stuff for validation. I mean, I still do some things that cis women don't do.
2671720	2676380	I sleep in a bra, which I'm pretty sure no cis woman has ever done. I do it because I need to
2676380	2681820	feel something, God, anything, taking up space on my chest. And feeling that reassures me enough
2681820	2686060	that I can fall asleep. Not so I can look at myself in the mirror, not so I can get off,
2686060	2687780	so I can simply fall asleep.
2688000	2692440	No one ever claimed that trans women are literally the same as cis women. We have many experiences
2692440	2696540	in common, but in other ways our experiences are very different. Yes, and you don't have the
2696540	2701640	oppression experiences that cis women have. Well, you know what, Abigail? You're right. For the most
2701640	2706260	part, I don't. But it's impossible for us to have an actual conversation about this because you're
2706260	2710400	just such a fucking asshole. And if you honestly want to talk about trans women and oppression
2710400	2715240	experiences, don't have this conversation with someone who started transitioning five months ago.
2715240	2717720	Go find someone who transitioned decades ago,
2717840	2720400	and talk to them about their experiences as women.
2720400	2723920	Your honor, the defendant does not bleed. I find that pretty conclusive.
2723920	2725600	As do I. Guilty as charged.
2725600	2729200	13. Final Thoughts
2729200	2734160	I think some cis people will be very congratulatory towards me for making this video. Some of them will
2734160	2739200	say things like, why can't all trans people be as calm and rational and open about their experiences
2739200	2743680	as you? Well, I'm very happy if you found the video elucidating, but I'd like cis people to
2743680	2744000	think a little bit harder about why not a lot of trans women talk about this. It's not just me, it's
2744000	2744080	not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me,
2744080	2747600	it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me, it's not just me.
2747600	2752320	It's humiliating, it's exhausting, and it's required me to publicize a detailed analysis
2752320	2756560	of my most private sexual feelings for the scrutiny of people who despise me. I've had
2756560	2761280	to discuss things that I'm honestly terrified to discuss, because I'm afraid that people will never
2761280	2766160	take me seriously as a woman, hence ruining any chance I have at happiness. For trans women,
2766160	2770720	this debate is intensely personal and risky. Our lives and happiness are at stake.
2770720	2773440	Meanwhile, Blanchard and Bailey are not just neutral,
2773440	2778560	devoted pursuers of scientific truth. They've continuously and needlessly been derisive and
2778560	2783680	cruel toward trans people, and they've misused their power as academic authorities to misrepresent
2783680	2788880	and humiliate us. No part of my present experience corresponds to the core claim of their theory.
2788880	2792960	I may drape myself in a hundred layers of defensive irony and depravity,
2792960	2798960	but I am at core a woman who is very thoroughly not in love with myself. So I have to hope,
2798960	2802960	for the sake of my own happiness, that someday I will be loved by someone who
2802960	2806080	thinks of me as a woman. Otherwise, I'm fucked.
2806080	2810400	This was a rough one girls, I dare say you've earned a song!
2814880	2823440	Thanks For the times that you've given me
2824960	2831600	The memories are all onto my mind
2831600	2831840	And now it's my turn For the times that you've given me
2831840	2832140	And now it's my turn
2832140	2832880	And now it's my turn
2832880	2832940	And now it's my turn
2832940	2847940	Now we've come to the end of our rainbow There's something I must say out loud
2847940	2870940	You're once, twice, three times a lady And I love all of you, yes I do
2871940	2876940	Yes, you're once, twice
2877940	2882940	Three times a lady
2883940	2890940	And I love all of you, yes I do
2891940	2898940	And I love you
2899940	2901940	One more time
2902940	2905940	And just a step to the right
2905940	2906940	Put your hands on your hips!
2908940	2910940	And bring your knees in tight
2911940	2913940	It's just a pelvic thrust
2914940	2917940	That really drives me insane
2918940	2922940	Let's do the time warp again
2924940	2929940	Let's do the time warp again
