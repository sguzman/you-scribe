WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:08.480
on the day that the female eunuch was issued in america a person in flapping draperies rushed up

00:08.480 --> 00:14.800
to me and grabbed my hand thank you it breathed hoarsely thank you so much for all you've done

00:14.800 --> 00:22.040
for us girls i smirked and nodded and stepped backward trying to extricate my hand from the

00:22.040 --> 00:29.860
enormous knuckly hairy beringan paw that clutched it the face staring into mine was thickly coated

00:29.860 --> 00:36.600
with a pancake makeup through which the stubble was already burgeoning in futile competition with

00:36.600 --> 00:43.880
a dine-out wig of immense luxuries and two pairs of false eyelashes against the bony ribs that

00:43.880 --> 00:50.520
could be counted through its flimsy scarf dress swung a polished steel woman's liberation emblem

00:50.520 --> 00:57.400
i should have said you're a man the female eunuch has done less than nothing for you

00:58.180 --> 00:58.980
piss off

00:58.980 --> 00:59.400
you

00:59.860 --> 01:09.080
let's go adult human females

01:09.080 --> 01:22.680
first of all a reminder that this video is a female only space so if there are any men here

01:22.680 --> 01:29.140
today get out i mean unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own

01:29.140 --> 01:29.840
in which case i'm going to let you know that this video is a female only space

01:29.840 --> 01:30.340
i'm going to let you know that this video is a male only space

01:30.340 --> 01:36.100
like comment subscribe so look it's 2019 and i think most people have heard about TERFs

01:36.100 --> 01:40.340
trans exclusionary radical feminists you know these fanatics like jermaine greer who call

01:40.340 --> 01:48.660
trans women it and think trans men are lost lesbian sisters you guys do know about trans men right male

01:48.660 --> 01:53.260
to female is not the only type of transgender person there's also people who were born well

01:53.860 --> 01:56.820
people who were assigned people who were always

01:56.820 --> 01:58.000
people who are born people who were always

01:58.000 --> 01:58.560
people who are always

01:58.560 --> 01:58.960
people who are always

01:58.960 --> 02:01.320
People who identify.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.760
TERFs don't like being called TERFs.

02:02.760 --> 02:05.640
They think it's a term of disparagement, which it is.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.960
They call themselves radical feminists, radfems,

02:07.960 --> 02:10.080
or lately, gender critical.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.920
The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity,

02:12.920 --> 02:15.820
gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal construct,

02:15.820 --> 02:17.560
and biological sex is the only thing

02:17.560 --> 02:19.180
that makes a person a man or a woman.

02:19.180 --> 02:20.380
In the past on this channel,

02:20.380 --> 02:23.160
I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry,

02:23.160 --> 02:25.180
man-hating bigots whose only real tactic

02:25.180 --> 02:27.280
is accusing trans women of being creepy men.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.520
And there definitely are some people

02:28.520 --> 02:30.740
who are really like that, but I wanna be fair.

02:30.740 --> 02:31.880
I wanna be balanced.

02:31.880 --> 02:33.960
So in preparation to make this video,

02:33.960 --> 02:36.420
I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people

02:36.420 --> 02:38.200
who used to be gender critical feminists

02:38.200 --> 02:39.520
to share their stories with me.

02:39.520 --> 02:41.020
And I got hundreds of responses,

02:41.020 --> 02:42.400
a lot of them from women who've had

02:42.400 --> 02:44.280
traumatic experiences with men,

02:44.280 --> 02:47.480
and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender

02:47.480 --> 02:50.020
where women and men are completely separate species,

02:50.020 --> 02:52.080
where women are safe and men are dangerous.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.260
And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people

02:54.260 --> 02:55.640
into their picture of the world,

02:55.640 --> 02:58.120
at first challenged their sense of stability

02:58.120 --> 02:59.080
and comfort.

02:59.080 --> 03:00.660
It was difficult emotional work,

03:00.660 --> 03:03.020
work they needed to do, but still difficult.

03:03.020 --> 03:04.180
And that makes total sense to me.

03:04.180 --> 03:06.020
Like it's very easy for me to understand

03:06.020 --> 03:07.360
why someone would feel that way.

03:07.360 --> 03:09.980
So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted

03:09.980 --> 03:11.560
to the gender critical worldview.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.860
And in this video, I don't just wanna parody TERFs.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.700
This time I wanna really engage with gender critical ideas

03:16.700 --> 03:19.440
in the public arena of free speech, open communication,

03:19.440 --> 03:21.040
dialogue, conversation, debate, idea,

03:21.040 --> 03:22.640
marketplace, expression, discourse.

03:22.640 --> 03:25.540
Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner rad femme.

03:25.540 --> 03:27.960
She's a little shy, sure, but she's here.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.020
Not queer, reads a lot of Germaine Greer.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.660
And when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty,

03:32.660 --> 03:35.420
she's feeling ex-extra biological.

03:35.420 --> 03:38.440
And when the full moon shines, she speaks.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.780
Oh, this is agony.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.240
I'm a biological woman trapped

03:44.240 --> 03:46.160
in the body of a male narcissist.

03:46.160 --> 03:47.760
Can you imagine?

03:47.760 --> 03:50.360
Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.600
But she's not a bigot, you know.

03:51.600 --> 03:53.620
I'm sure she doesn't hate trans people.

03:53.620 --> 03:56.700
She just has a few concerns.

03:56.700 --> 03:57.760
You know, it's like you're not even allowed

03:57.760 --> 04:01.180
to ask questions anymore or you're accused of transphobia.

04:01.180 --> 04:04.000
We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology

04:04.000 --> 04:06.920
that we, the public, never got a chance to debate.

04:06.920 --> 04:09.200
We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.480
yet here we are allowing biological males

04:11.480 --> 04:13.340
to run rampant in women's spaces,

04:13.340 --> 04:15.220
foisting penises on lesbians,

04:15.220 --> 04:18.260
and indoctrinating our children with the ludicrous dogma

04:18.260 --> 04:20.800
that girls can become boys with a change of costume.

04:20.800 --> 04:23.640
Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.240
She goes on like that for hours.

04:25.240 --> 04:27.520
It's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator shaft

04:27.520 --> 04:29.020
with the ghost of Anita Bryant.

04:29.020 --> 04:30.920
Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?

04:30.920 --> 04:32.860
Do you have any idea how many decades

04:32.860 --> 04:34.100
I fought for your rights?

04:34.100 --> 04:35.380
Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?

04:35.380 --> 04:36.980
Scholars remain divided.

04:36.980 --> 04:38.300
It does seem like it's getting harder

04:38.300 --> 04:40.380
to have conversations about difficult topics.

04:40.380 --> 04:41.780
You know, our children are coming of age

04:41.780 --> 04:44.620
in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face consequences

04:44.620 --> 04:47.160
for simply having a politically incorrect opinion

04:47.160 --> 04:48.420
about the Jewish question.

04:48.420 --> 04:49.920
It's PC run AMOC.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.000
It's a Hanna catastrophe.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.300
Problematic banter aside,

04:53.300 --> 04:55.300
the current discourse about transgender issues

04:55.300 --> 04:57.360
is an explosion of untreated sewage.

04:57.520 --> 04:59.080
We have far-right politicians menacing us

04:59.080 --> 05:00.700
with legal discrimination and erasure.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.900
We have fear mongering and hostility in the press.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.280
And that, combined with high rates of family rejection

05:05.280 --> 05:08.100
and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.

05:08.100 --> 05:10.760
So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing,

05:10.760 --> 05:13.760
and shield ourselves behind simple, unambiguous slogans.

05:13.760 --> 05:15.560
Trans women are women.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.500
Which is true.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.340
We are women.

05:17.340 --> 05:19.320
But, ooh, that was a sinister but.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.160
Watch out for that.

05:20.160 --> 05:22.160
What happens is that people who don't really understand

05:22.160 --> 05:24.580
trans issues, in other words, most people,

05:24.580 --> 05:27.380
have lots of unanswered questions about the details.

05:27.520 --> 05:30.420
In particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory,

05:30.420 --> 05:33.080
but not transfeminism, might wonder things like,

05:33.080 --> 05:34.160
how can you be a woman

05:34.160 --> 05:36.240
without the oppression experiences of girlhood?

05:36.240 --> 05:37.700
Why can't you just be a feminine man

05:37.700 --> 05:40.480
instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.280
Why are misogynistic gender ideologues

05:44.280 --> 05:47.240
erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?

05:47.240 --> 05:49.420
Trans people don't like engaging with these questions

05:49.420 --> 05:50.500
because most of the time,

05:50.500 --> 05:52.740
they're just brandished as weapons against us.

05:52.740 --> 05:53.880
You know, it's like when a man asks,

05:53.880 --> 05:56.040
if society is so sexist against women,

05:56.040 --> 05:57.500
then why is it that men are 90s

05:57.520 --> 06:00.480
and 7% of combat fatalities, feminazis?

06:00.480 --> 06:02.180
Like, you could sit there for three hours

06:02.180 --> 06:04.140
trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal,

06:04.140 --> 06:07.620
but wouldn't you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?

06:07.620 --> 06:08.980
Because nine times out of 10,

06:08.980 --> 06:11.680
that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities.

06:11.680 --> 06:13.220
He's just trolling you to shut down

06:13.220 --> 06:14.800
whatever actual point you are making.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.500
And the same goes for people telling me,

06:16.500 --> 06:18.760
you sure do like wearing nails and makeup.

06:18.760 --> 06:21.140
Is that all you think there is to being a woman?

06:21.140 --> 06:23.180
Could you define womanhood for me?

06:23.180 --> 06:24.620
Like, they don't actually care.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.960
They're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.860
But if you really are sincerely wondering

06:28.860 --> 06:30.720
about the answer to these troll questions,

06:30.720 --> 06:31.880
and many people are,

06:31.880 --> 06:33.940
then you actually need fairly complicated

06:33.940 --> 06:35.120
and nuanced answers,

06:35.120 --> 06:37.400
which is why they make such good troll questions,

06:37.400 --> 06:39.020
because they waste a lot of your time.

06:39.020 --> 06:40.960
In this video, I want to take at face value

06:40.960 --> 06:43.300
the questions and concerns associated

06:43.300 --> 06:46.000
with gender-critical hostility to trans people,

06:46.000 --> 06:47.960
and I want to try to give nuanced answers

06:47.960 --> 06:49.580
rather than dogmatic ones.

06:49.580 --> 06:52.200
Now, the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard,

06:52.200 --> 06:54.460
so I might fuck something up.

06:54.460 --> 06:56.640
And a lot of trans people want me to represent them

06:56.640 --> 06:58.020
absolutely perfectly.

06:58.020 --> 07:00.080
So, if I do fuck something up,

07:00.080 --> 07:02.460
well, just read me to filth on Twitter

07:02.460 --> 07:04.080
like you always do, you little shits.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.180
Love you.

07:05.180 --> 07:08.100
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.920
Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?

07:11.920 --> 07:14.760
We have 13 beautiful women on our show today.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.700
Only the catch is that some of them are actually men.

07:17.700 --> 07:19.240
Oops, wrong channel.

07:20.860 --> 07:23.480
Concern one, gender metaphysics.

07:23.480 --> 07:26.640
There is no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.960
There are no pink brains and blue brains.

07:28.960 --> 07:30.520
Just because you want to be a woman

07:30.520 --> 07:31.680
doesn't mean you are one.

07:31.680 --> 07:34.980
This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.

07:34.980 --> 07:37.200
Trans people often use metaphorical language

07:37.200 --> 07:39.640
to describe feelings that are difficult to put into words,

07:39.640 --> 07:41.380
and that's how I understand the trapped

07:41.380 --> 07:42.700
in the wrong body language.

07:42.700 --> 07:45.080
Is there literally such a thing as a male soul

07:45.080 --> 07:47.380
trapped in a female body, or vice versa?

07:47.380 --> 07:49.020
I personally don't believe there is,

07:49.020 --> 07:50.620
but I'm a little biased.

07:50.620 --> 07:52.940
I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman,

07:52.940 --> 07:55.400
and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine habit.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.040
As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting

08:00.040 --> 08:02.640
a correlation between binary transgender identity

08:02.640 --> 08:04.180
and cross-sex brain anatomy,

08:04.180 --> 08:05.980
but the evidence really doesn't justify claims

08:05.980 --> 08:08.980
about female brains and male bodies or anything like that.

08:08.980 --> 08:10.560
Brain differences between men and women

08:10.560 --> 08:12.420
are statistical averages of things

08:12.420 --> 08:14.180
like gray and white matter density,

08:14.180 --> 08:16.800
not, as the term female brain implies,

08:16.800 --> 08:20.320
distinct anatomical structures like penises and vaginas.

08:20.320 --> 08:21.900
So I personally don't believe

08:21.900 --> 08:23.600
in any gender metaphysics at all.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.640
I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person,

08:25.640 --> 08:28.400
so much for the unquestionable dogma of the trans cult,

08:28.400 --> 08:31.060
and that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man

08:31.060 --> 08:32.880
rather than as always having been a woman.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.260
But it's important to remember

08:34.260 --> 08:36.620
that while I may not fit the typical profile,

08:36.620 --> 08:39.200
I am not real and not valid.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.200
But in any case, I live as a woman now,

08:41.200 --> 08:44.020
and that's kind of just what's happening

08:44.020 --> 08:47.260
whether you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.

08:47.260 --> 08:49.860
My view is well expressed by Katherine McKinnon.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.220
I always thought I don't care

08:51.220 --> 08:53.640
how someone becomes a woman or a man.

08:53.640 --> 08:54.600
It doesn't matter to me.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.100
Anybody who identifies as a woman,

08:57.100 --> 09:00.060
wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman,

09:00.060 --> 09:02.160
as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.240
Concern two, gender stereotypes.

09:06.240 --> 09:08.020
What do you mean you live as a woman?

09:08.020 --> 09:10.320
You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes

09:10.320 --> 09:13.340
by putting on nails, makeup, and a fake girly voice?

09:13.340 --> 09:15.120
Listen, sweaty, first of all,

09:15.120 --> 09:18.080
my girly voice is very fucking real.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.680
Second, my clothes, makeup, voice,

09:20.680 --> 09:22.700
none of this makes me a woman.

09:22.700 --> 09:24.600
No trans woman thinks that femininity,

09:24.600 --> 09:26.100
and womanhood are the same.

09:26.100 --> 09:28.380
Rather, we're using a cultural language

09:28.380 --> 09:30.900
of feminine signifiers to prompt others

09:30.900 --> 09:32.380
to see us for what we are.

09:32.380 --> 09:34.480
Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends

09:34.480 --> 09:36.400
don't really understand why I'm presenting

09:36.400 --> 09:38.500
in such a meticulously feminine way.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.140
Like, they think I'm wearing ombre lips at 11 a.m.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.040
because I'm playing some kind of clout game,

09:43.040 --> 09:45.940
which I am, but also, if one person calls me sir,

09:45.940 --> 09:47.360
that's gonna ruin my day.

09:47.360 --> 09:49.920
So I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall

09:49.920 --> 09:52.720
in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.

09:52.720 --> 09:54.600
I think butch or gender non-conforming cis women,

09:54.600 --> 09:57.660
sometimes side-eye hyper-feminine trans women,

09:57.660 --> 09:59.380
because they don't identify with this vision

09:59.380 --> 10:01.780
of womanhood at all, and they've had to struggle

10:01.780 --> 10:04.540
since childhood against a society that's told them

10:04.540 --> 10:05.840
they have to be feminine.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.800
And I completely sympathize with that.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.720
I think there should be more gender freedom,

10:09.720 --> 10:11.600
less coercion, less restriction.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.960
But also, I have had to fight against the same society

10:14.960 --> 10:18.540
that told me I should really, really, really not be this.

10:18.540 --> 10:20.940
So, I feel like we should be able to form

10:20.940 --> 10:22.700
some kind of solidarity here.

10:22.700 --> 10:23.540
What, what, what?

10:24.600 --> 10:26.380
Sorry, abolish gender.

10:26.380 --> 10:28.780
But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs

10:28.780 --> 10:31.700
of masculinity and femininity, not conforming to them.

10:31.700 --> 10:35.700
Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.

10:35.700 --> 10:37.040
Abolish gender?

10:37.040 --> 10:39.260
Well, that sounds like an ambitious project

10:39.260 --> 10:43.320
for one transsexual, but I mean, I'll give it a try.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.880
Solanus be praised.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.820
No nails, no makeup.

10:46.820 --> 10:49.580
I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.

10:49.580 --> 10:50.800
I did it, everyone.

10:50.800 --> 10:52.440
I abolished gender.

10:52.440 --> 10:54.580
Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier.

10:54.600 --> 10:56.900
So, I should probably get rid of that.

10:56.900 --> 10:59.440
How is she though?

10:59.440 --> 11:01.940
She's feeling a little genderless.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.060
I guess the way I position my body is still gendered

11:04.060 --> 11:06.320
and there's a gendered cadence to my voice.

11:06.320 --> 11:08.980
So, what I'm gonna do is just hold my hands up genderlessly

11:08.980 --> 11:11.060
and speak in a genderless robot voice.

11:11.060 --> 11:14.500
My name is 5-4-6-6-4-1-7.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.080
I have no gender.

11:16.080 --> 11:18.160
Patriarchy is over.

11:18.160 --> 11:20.640
I guess English is still a patriarchal language, right?

11:20.640 --> 11:21.940
So, I should probably be communicating

11:21.940 --> 11:23.280
with a series of genderless sounds.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.100
Meow, meow.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.820
Meow, meow, meow, meow, I can't stand this.

11:26.820 --> 11:27.420
Fuck this.

11:27.420 --> 11:30.040
Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea.

11:30.040 --> 11:32.780
Like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth

11:32.780 --> 11:35.000
didn't determine what kind of life you could live?

11:35.000 --> 11:38.620
But that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change,

11:38.620 --> 11:40.220
kind of like abolish borders.

11:40.220 --> 11:42.680
Your utopian pipe dream is valid.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.880
And denying trans people their gender identity

11:44.880 --> 11:48.320
because abolish gender is kind of like denying citizenship

11:48.320 --> 11:50.480
to immigrants because abolish borders.

11:50.480 --> 11:51.820
Like, you're targeting the people

11:51.820 --> 11:54.600
who are the most vulnerable under the present system, and then,

11:54.600 --> 11:56.520
leveraging that system against them

11:56.520 --> 11:58.260
under the pretense of abolishing it.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.980
You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists

11:59.980 --> 12:02.220
in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments, like,

12:02.220 --> 12:05.160
why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?

12:05.160 --> 12:06.420
You should be abolishing gender,

12:06.420 --> 12:09.220
not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.300
No, they don't attack the gender expression

12:11.300 --> 12:13.040
of people with power and influence.

12:13.040 --> 12:15.020
They're all on Twitter harassing some poor,

12:15.020 --> 12:17.280
newly-out trans woman with 200 followers,

12:17.280 --> 12:18.820
and calling her a creepy man,

12:18.820 --> 12:20.840
and mocking her for being feminine ineptly,

12:20.840 --> 12:23.820
or being too feminine, or not being feminine enough.

12:24.600 --> 12:26.160
Like, when they say abolish gender,

12:26.160 --> 12:28.760
what they really mean is abolish trans people.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.000
It's almost like this is a hate movement

12:31.000 --> 12:33.880
hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist platitudes.

12:33.880 --> 12:36.380
But surely, I must be missing something.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.360
Concern four, male privilege.

12:40.360 --> 12:43.540
It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement

12:43.540 --> 12:46.100
that you think you can just claim womanhood for yourself

12:46.100 --> 12:48.620
without living any of the struggle that entails.

12:48.620 --> 12:52.180
So look, I'm a successful, white, middle-class trans woman.

12:52.180 --> 12:53.620
In the grand scheme of things,

12:53.620 --> 12:55.460
I'm really not very oppressed.

12:55.460 --> 12:58.960
I may not be the 1%, but I am the tranny 1%.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.020
So I don't like to complain

13:00.020 --> 13:02.060
about every little micro-aggression I experience,

13:02.060 --> 13:04.720
because under the circumstances,

13:04.720 --> 13:06.540
it just seems a little gauche.

13:06.540 --> 13:08.680
And I don't like things that are gauche.

13:08.680 --> 13:11.060
But I've had cis feminists of my race and class

13:11.060 --> 13:13.080
tell me that I have no idea what it's like

13:13.080 --> 13:14.980
to be talked over and interrupted by men.

13:14.980 --> 13:17.280
Actually, Kropotkin.

13:17.280 --> 13:19.040
Or to experience street harassment,

13:19.040 --> 13:20.580
or to have to treat every first date

13:20.580 --> 13:22.740
like a potentially life-threatening situation.

13:22.740 --> 13:25.900
And it's just bizarre to me that they think that.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.340
Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?

13:28.340 --> 13:30.320
You think men treat me as their equal?

13:30.320 --> 13:32.100
You think street harassers are gonna treat me

13:32.100 --> 13:35.100
with dignity and respect because I have a Y chromosome?

13:35.100 --> 13:37.340
Hey, beautiful, where you going, baby?

13:37.340 --> 13:38.260
Where you going?

13:38.260 --> 13:39.360
Oh, it's tranny.

13:39.360 --> 13:41.200
Excuse me, sir, my mistake.

13:41.200 --> 13:44.440
Please proceed freely to your destination.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.500
Come on, people, use your heads.

13:46.500 --> 13:49.060
When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it,

13:49.060 --> 13:49.900
what do you think the guy

13:49.900 --> 13:51.700
in the steps of the liquor store is gonna say?

13:51.700 --> 13:52.580
When a trans woman doesn't pass,

13:52.580 --> 13:55.900
it's not like society simply treats her like a man.

13:55.900 --> 13:58.000
No, you get treated as monster gender,

13:58.000 --> 13:59.740
pronouns it and spit,

13:59.740 --> 14:01.700
and male privilege is not a good description

14:01.700 --> 14:03.260
of that experience at all.

14:03.260 --> 14:04.620
Once you start passing as a woman,

14:04.620 --> 14:06.040
it's really a step up,

14:06.040 --> 14:07.840
even though women get treated bad,

14:07.840 --> 14:11.260
because it's still better to be a she than an it.

14:11.260 --> 14:13.580
Now, gender-critical feminists are really skeptical

14:13.580 --> 14:15.080
of the whole notion of passing.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.960
They think they can always clock a tran,

14:16.960 --> 14:18.900
and they assume everyone else can too.

14:18.900 --> 14:20.900
But that's just not reality.

14:20.900 --> 14:22.240
I mean, I'm only a year and a half

14:22.240 --> 14:23.480
into my transition,

14:23.480 --> 14:25.560
and at this point I've had zero surgeries,

14:25.560 --> 14:27.400
and it's been like six months

14:27.400 --> 14:29.320
since I was last misgendered offline.

14:29.320 --> 14:30.820
I mean, a person with a good eye for it

14:30.820 --> 14:32.060
will probably clock me,

14:32.060 --> 14:34.640
and maybe a lot of people have just been indoctrinated

14:34.640 --> 14:36.540
into politically correct gender ideology,

14:36.540 --> 14:39.160
but like, you really think the gas station attendant

14:39.160 --> 14:41.700
and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy

14:41.700 --> 14:43.300
are all calling me miss and ma'am

14:43.300 --> 14:45.760
because of post-modernism?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.060
I know some of you are gonna sneak off

14:47.060 --> 14:48.780
to your shitty little radfem forums

14:48.780 --> 14:51.360
and obsess over how manly and clockable I am, but like,

14:51.360 --> 14:52.080
at the end of the day, I'm a woman.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.840
At the end of the day, what am I gonna trust?

14:53.840 --> 14:56.560
The deranged hate posting of 25 frothing anons,

14:56.560 --> 14:59.860
or every social interaction I've had for months?

14:59.860 --> 15:02.320
I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.

15:02.320 --> 15:04.580
I'm ahi tuna, and you're mackerel sweaty.

15:04.580 --> 15:06.180
Take a fuckin' sip, babes.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.160
I love that.

15:11.820 --> 15:14.340
Concern five, male socialization.

15:14.340 --> 15:15.700
So you had a male upbringing,

15:15.700 --> 15:17.900
you never experienced the traumas of girlhood,

15:17.900 --> 15:20.000
you benefited from male privilege for decades,

15:20.000 --> 15:21.580
and now you think none of that matters?

15:22.080 --> 15:23.840
You are because of how you were socialized,

15:23.840 --> 15:25.400
not because of how you dress.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.000
All right, it's time to crack open the nuance.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.020
So on the one hand, you're partially right.

15:33.020 --> 15:35.060
I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled

15:35.060 --> 15:36.060
as a nine-year-old girl,

15:36.060 --> 15:37.760
or what that does to a child's psyche.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.380
That kind of thing didn't start happening to me

15:39.380 --> 15:40.360
till I was an adult,

15:40.360 --> 15:42.520
when I knew what I was getting into and was ready for it.

15:42.520 --> 15:44.860
That's very different from what cis women go through.

15:44.860 --> 15:47.140
My upbringing in adolescence has more in common

15:47.140 --> 15:49.040
with a typical man than a typical woman,

15:49.040 --> 15:51.200
and many of my experiences from those days,

15:51.200 --> 15:54.460
I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.

15:54.460 --> 15:56.720
I absolutely benefited from male privilege,

15:56.720 --> 15:58.580
and it did influence who I was.

15:58.580 --> 16:01.000
And who I was in my late teens and early 20s

16:01.000 --> 16:02.620
was an anti-feminist shithead

16:02.620 --> 16:04.440
who had no idea what women go through.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.640
And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that,

16:06.640 --> 16:07.880
because in trans discourse,

16:07.880 --> 16:10.620
it's just accepted as obvious that trans men

16:10.620 --> 16:12.440
know what it's like to be raised as women,

16:12.440 --> 16:15.340
and to be influenced by those formative female experiences.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.060
But when it comes to the early life experiences

16:17.060 --> 16:18.760
of trans women, we're supposed to say,

16:18.760 --> 16:21.080
"'When I was five years old, I loved wearing my mom's high

16:21.080 --> 16:23.220
heels,' or else say nothing at all."

16:23.220 --> 16:25.640
There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath,

16:25.640 --> 16:27.500
where she describes the way living as a woman

16:27.500 --> 16:29.480
stifles an adventurous spirit

16:29.480 --> 16:31.660
and her longing for a male experience.

16:31.660 --> 16:35.960
Yes, my consuming desires to mingle with road crews,

16:35.960 --> 16:39.140
sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars,

16:39.140 --> 16:43.960
to be part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording.

16:43.960 --> 16:48.280
All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl,

16:48.280 --> 16:51.080
a female, always supposedly in danger,

16:51.080 --> 16:53.040
of assault and battery.

16:53.040 --> 16:55.960
My consuming interest in men and their lives

16:55.960 --> 17:00.000
is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them,

17:00.000 --> 17:02.540
or as an invitation to intimacy.

17:02.540 --> 17:06.940
Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.

17:06.940 --> 17:09.600
I want to be able to sleep in an open field,

17:09.600 --> 17:13.220
to travel west, to walk freely at night."

17:13.220 --> 17:15.840
So I got to do all of that in my early twenties.

17:15.840 --> 17:19.040
And what I discovered is I hate sleeping in open fields.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.500
I despise the West.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.780
And I'd really rather stay inside,

17:22.780 --> 17:24.820
collecting ceramics and sucking dick.

17:24.820 --> 17:26.380
Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.420
And I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is a man

17:28.420 --> 17:31.020
because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews

17:31.020 --> 17:33.000
for reasons that are inconceivable to me.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.720
What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-twenties,

17:35.720 --> 17:38.400
I realized that I was inhabiting a gender, body,

17:38.400 --> 17:41.420
and sexual persona that were drastically wrong for me.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.920
And I tried every possible alternative to transitioning

17:43.920 --> 17:46.260
before realizing that I had an irrepressible need

17:46.260 --> 17:47.200
to become a woman.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.700
So I changed.

17:48.700 --> 17:49.760
And when I changed,

17:49.760 --> 17:51.580
society's treatment of me changed.

17:51.580 --> 17:53.760
Socialization doesn't end with childhood.

17:53.760 --> 17:55.320
It's a lifelong process.

17:55.320 --> 17:57.140
For example, when I transitioned,

17:57.140 --> 17:59.900
my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers,

17:59.900 --> 18:02.360
and radical feminist haters started commenting

18:02.360 --> 18:05.780
on my physical appearance about 20 to 30 times more often.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.460
And I had to get used to that being something

18:07.460 --> 18:08.780
that matters a lot more.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.400
That said, resocialization takes time.

18:11.400 --> 18:14.100
And sometimes trans people who are early in transition

18:14.100 --> 18:15.860
have most of that process ahead of them.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.540
I also think we have to take into account

18:17.540 --> 18:19.640
the age at which a person transitions.

18:19.760 --> 18:21.480
I'm Petrus, whomst we stan.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.320
Oh, we stan.

18:22.320 --> 18:23.160
We stan.

18:23.160 --> 18:24.000
Oh, we stan.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.820
I stan.

18:24.820 --> 18:25.660
Oh, we stan.

18:25.660 --> 18:26.720
She transitioned as a child,

18:26.720 --> 18:28.700
and I imagine was socialized more or less

18:28.700 --> 18:29.820
the same as a cis woman.

18:29.820 --> 18:32.400
Whereas, Caitlyn Jenner, whomst, well,

18:33.980 --> 18:34.820
just whomst.

18:34.820 --> 18:36.680
She made millions of dollars in men's sports.

18:36.680 --> 18:38.540
She had six children by three wives.

18:38.540 --> 18:41.000
She transitioned in retirement at age 65

18:41.000 --> 18:43.620
and told Buzzfeed that the hardest part of being a woman

18:43.620 --> 18:45.580
is figuring out what to wear.

18:46.580 --> 18:49.180
This is the only trans woman most people have heard of.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.200
It makes me want to cry.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.400
Like, I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman,

18:52.400 --> 18:54.280
but I am saying that anyone who wants to argue

18:54.280 --> 18:56.600
that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective

18:56.600 --> 18:58.100
doesn't have a leg to stand on.

18:58.100 --> 19:01.140
But also, trans women often don't experience

19:01.140 --> 19:03.300
male socialization the way cis men do.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.080
Many trans women are feminine and queer

19:05.080 --> 19:07.440
before they transition and have always experienced

19:07.440 --> 19:09.900
a kind of femphobia that is rooted in misogyny.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.840
Some trans women also identified as women

19:11.840 --> 19:14.220
years before transitioning and internalized

19:14.220 --> 19:15.940
society's messaging about women

19:15.940 --> 19:18.040
more than society's messaging about men.

19:18.040 --> 19:19.180
Now, that's still not the same

19:19.180 --> 19:21.440
as living in society as a girl from birth,

19:21.440 --> 19:22.840
but it's also pretty different

19:22.840 --> 19:25.000
from the socialization of most cis men.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.300
I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue

19:27.300 --> 19:29.920
that trans women never experience male privilege

19:29.920 --> 19:32.340
is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege

19:32.340 --> 19:34.660
as a proxy for calling us men.

19:34.660 --> 19:35.700
Pull up your zipper.

19:35.700 --> 19:38.180
Your male privilege is hanging out.

19:38.180 --> 19:40.820
I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point

19:40.820 --> 19:42.620
for many gender-critical feminists

19:42.620 --> 19:45.180
is that there's an element here of stolen valor,

19:45.180 --> 19:47.580
the sense of injustice that people are claiming

19:47.580 --> 19:49.160
their identity without experiencing it.

19:49.180 --> 19:52.180
It reminds me of what in the trans community

19:52.180 --> 19:54.180
are called transmedicalists,

19:54.180 --> 19:56.560
people who insist the only real trans people

19:56.560 --> 19:58.900
are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.560
In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing

20:01.560 --> 20:04.120
that confirms your identity is pain.

20:04.120 --> 20:07.020
What it is to be trans is to despise your body.

20:07.020 --> 20:10.080
What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.

20:10.080 --> 20:12.120
You didn't suffer like I've suffered.

20:12.120 --> 20:13.740
You don't know what it's like.

20:13.740 --> 20:15.240
You know, I'm tempted to strike back

20:15.240 --> 20:17.200
by saying that you don't know what it's like

20:17.200 --> 20:18.500
to occupy an identity so stigmatized

20:18.500 --> 20:19.040
that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity so stigmatized

20:19.040 --> 20:19.540
that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity so stigmatized

20:19.540 --> 20:22.040
that most of the people who are attracted to you in private

20:22.040 --> 20:24.040
are too ashamed to admit it in public.

20:24.040 --> 20:26.440
You don't know what it's like to have a body so non-normative

20:26.440 --> 20:28.700
that you're shut out of whole areas of society.

20:28.700 --> 20:32.060
I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest

20:32.060 --> 20:33.840
does nothing but to provoke infighting

20:33.840 --> 20:35.640
between trans women and cis women

20:35.640 --> 20:38.020
at a time when we should be marching side-by-side

20:38.020 --> 20:39.800
to destroy video games forever.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.560
Hashtag yes all gamers.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.440
Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.

20:45.440 --> 20:46.740
You don't know what it's like

20:46.740 --> 20:48.360
to grow up being shamed for your periods,

20:48.360 --> 20:50.040
to fear unwanted pregnancy,

20:50.040 --> 20:52.040
to have to fight for your right to abortion,

20:52.040 --> 20:54.280
to bear the pain of childbirth.

20:54.280 --> 20:57.400
Well, yeah, that's true.

20:57.400 --> 21:00.840
My inner Rad Femme sways in a gentle, victorious samba.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.680
I do think it's important for trans women

21:02.680 --> 21:04.520
to stand in solidarity with cis women

21:04.520 --> 21:07.000
on issues like period equity and abortion rights,

21:07.000 --> 21:08.840
and to learn about the experiences of cis women

21:08.840 --> 21:10.440
to form a more complete understanding

21:10.440 --> 21:11.640
of the female condition.

21:11.640 --> 21:14.120
But of course, no individual woman experiences

21:14.120 --> 21:15.880
all the things women experience,

21:15.880 --> 21:18.360
and individual women understand the meaning of womanhood.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.880
In drastically different ways.

21:19.880 --> 21:21.320
For some women, having babies

21:21.320 --> 21:23.480
is the most essentially womanly experience.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.800
For others, maybe it's having an abortion.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.720
I mean, not actually, but you know,

21:27.720 --> 21:29.640
TERFs pretend it is to own the trannies.

21:29.640 --> 21:32.040
For me, it's receiving 12-paragraph emails

21:32.040 --> 21:34.040
in my business inbox from married men

21:34.040 --> 21:35.800
struggling through the existential crisis

21:35.800 --> 21:38.760
of some kind of shemale-themed sexual awakening.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.120
Also, do you wanna be a guest

21:40.120 --> 21:42.440
on my podcast, Free Speech Radio?

21:42.440 --> 21:45.000
But also, not all women experience their womanhood

21:45.000 --> 21:46.360
as essentially oppressive,

21:46.360 --> 21:48.280
or centered around the pain of reproductive health.

21:48.360 --> 21:49.320
And that's not the only reason

21:49.320 --> 21:50.760
I'm not talking about the gender gap.

21:50.760 --> 21:51.480
I'm talking about the gender gap

21:51.480 --> 21:52.600
in the capacity of men.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.480
When Shania Twain sang,

21:53.480 --> 21:54.440
Man, I Feel Like a Woman,

21:54.440 --> 21:56.680
she wasn't talking about having a coat hanger abortion

21:56.680 --> 21:59.320
in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.560
Man, I feel like shit.

22:03.720 --> 22:06.840
Concern seven, erasing female vocabulary.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.720
Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary needed

22:09.720 --> 22:11.880
to discuss women's bodies and women's oppression.

22:11.880 --> 22:14.200
We are now expected to talk about pregnant people

22:14.200 --> 22:17.480
and menstruators just to appease the gender ideologues.

22:17.480 --> 22:18.840
I'm a menstruator.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.640
I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N,

22:21.640 --> 22:24.040
and I will not be erased.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.200
Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator or pregnant people

22:28.200 --> 22:28.920
and are thinking,

22:28.920 --> 22:31.160
what the fuck kind of Orwellian newspeak

22:31.160 --> 22:32.920
gender cuckoldry is that?

22:32.920 --> 22:36.040
Take a deep breath, clear your mind, here's the tea.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.600
Some medical organizations have recently begun using the term

22:38.600 --> 22:40.840
pregnant people instead of pregnant women.

22:40.840 --> 22:44.280
And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word menstruators

22:44.280 --> 22:46.600
in a tweet about the repeal of a tampon tax.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.960
This prompted some conservative TERF and Christian publications

22:49.960 --> 22:54.520
to post panicked commentaries warning that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.

22:54.520 --> 22:58.840
But in fact, medical language that assumes that everyone with a uterus is a woman

22:58.840 --> 23:02.760
erases trans men or non-binary people who menstruate and get pregnant.

23:02.760 --> 23:05.800
So saying pregnant women in this context erases them,

23:05.800 --> 23:09.000
whereas saying pregnant people includes them and cis women

23:09.000 --> 23:10.280
and doesn't erase anyone.

23:10.280 --> 23:10.920
Except for...

23:10.920 --> 23:13.720
...Cincinnatians, because we all know they're not people.

23:13.720 --> 23:15.960
Take your shitty chili elsewhere, but I'm a woman,

23:15.960 --> 23:17.480
not a goddamn menstruator.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.720
What kind of misogynistic madness is it to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?

23:21.720 --> 23:25.640
I actually agree with you that the word menstruator sounds pretty dehumanizing,

23:25.640 --> 23:29.000
and the trans men I've talked to about this aren't the biggest fans of it either.

23:29.000 --> 23:33.240
Sometimes it takes a while to settle on language that's both inclusive and usable,

23:33.240 --> 23:36.840
and my prediction is that menstruators is not gonna work out.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.520
Maybe people who menstruate?

23:38.520 --> 23:40.200
But why can't I just say woman?

23:40.200 --> 23:42.280
That's what I am.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.040
You can't just say woman.

23:44.040 --> 23:45.480
That is what you are.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.680
I'm just asking that you stop referring to yourself as a woman.

23:48.680 --> 23:53.080
Institutional medical language is designed to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.

23:53.080 --> 23:58.040
No one is proposing that we stop calling individual women pregnant women or expectant mothers.

23:58.040 --> 24:01.000
Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.

24:01.000 --> 24:03.960
I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.800
I notice you're not suggesting doctors start saying people with prostates.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.200
Though I am definitely suggesting that.

24:10.200 --> 24:15.480
But trans activists are invading feminist spaces and telling women we can't discuss our own bodies.

24:15.480 --> 24:19.640
I have no problem with cis feminists discussing or celebrating periods

24:19.640 --> 24:24.280
or wearing pussy hats at political marches or free bleeding all over the National Mall.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.480
I mean, someone has to.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.040
The National Mall is not gonna bleed on itself.

24:28.040 --> 24:32.120
I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate their reproductive anatomy

24:32.120 --> 24:36.200
in defiance of a society that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.

24:36.200 --> 24:41.320
The problem arises only when menstruation or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender trans men

24:41.320 --> 24:43.720
or exclude wombs whom doth not bleed.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.320
I mean, trans women do bleed.

24:45.320 --> 24:47.560
But only when we cut ourselves.

24:47.560 --> 24:53.640
No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.

24:54.760 --> 24:56.200
Concern 8.

24:56.200 --> 24:57.480
TERF is a slur.

24:58.040 --> 25:01.080
TERF is a slur designed to silence women.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.680
Nay, it is hate speech designed to incite violence against women.

25:04.680 --> 25:09.560
The word TERF is a pejorative for a person who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism.

25:09.560 --> 25:11.000
But it's not a slur.

25:11.000 --> 25:15.240
A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race, religion, gender, or sexuality.

25:15.720 --> 25:19.560
The word misogynist is pejorative, it has only negative connotations,

25:19.560 --> 25:22.440
and is often used as an insult, but it's not a slur.

25:22.440 --> 25:25.880
It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs, not a type of person.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.720
The same is true of the word TERF.

25:27.720 --> 25:32.440
It's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors that deserve to be derogated.

25:32.440 --> 25:35.320
The term gender critical is really a euphemism,

25:35.320 --> 25:40.200
recently created to replace TERF with a phrase that doesn't have such negative connotations.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.080
It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race realist,

25:43.080 --> 25:45.080
which was invented by racists wanting a

25:45.080 --> 25:47.960
more flattering and respectable description of their beliefs.

25:47.960 --> 25:52.200
I've used the term gender critical in this video to be inviting to fence-sitters,

25:52.200 --> 25:56.360
but I refuse to cooperate with racists who want me to use their euphemisms,

25:56.360 --> 25:58.840
and I generally do the same with TERFs.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.960
Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person.

26:01.960 --> 26:04.760
I usually like to call people by whatever they want to be called.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.400
But when it comes to race realist or gender critical,

26:08.040 --> 26:09.560
every time I use these phrases,

26:09.560 --> 26:13.720
I'm essentially becoming an accomplice in their scheme to legitimize bigotry.

26:13.720 --> 26:15.000
And I have especially...

26:15.000 --> 26:18.760
little patience for TERF requests for linguistic decorum,

26:18.760 --> 26:24.200
since most of the language used by TERFs is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful,

26:24.200 --> 26:26.600
harmful, and insulting to trans people.

26:26.600 --> 26:31.800
For instance, TERFs refer to any and all trans-related surgery as mutilation.

26:31.800 --> 26:36.280
They call trans women TIMs, an acronym for trans-identified males,

26:36.280 --> 26:39.720
and trans men TIFs, trans-identified females,

26:39.720 --> 26:42.760
obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.760
Just to give you a sample of typical TERF

26:44.760 --> 26:48.440
prose, here are a couple comments from literally the first thread I saw

26:48.440 --> 26:51.480
on the Gender Critical subreddit while I was working on this video.

26:51.480 --> 26:55.160
And I have to admit to considerably more contempt for the likes of

26:56.120 --> 27:00.440
since he makes a point of taking selfies with ridiculous,

27:00.440 --> 27:02.600
insulting-to-women facial expressions.

27:03.320 --> 27:07.800
I also get a good laugh at TIMs putting their hands up to their chins.

27:07.800 --> 27:11.480
They're trying to look all dainty and to hide their Adam's apple,

27:11.480 --> 27:13.960
but it only draws more attention to their

27:13.960 --> 27:14.680
ENORMAL

27:14.760 --> 27:15.960
MISS MAN hands.

27:15.960 --> 27:20.200
I saw an AGP photoshoot with this neanderthal in his 50s,

27:20.200 --> 27:23.320
was posing with one leg up like a flamingo,

27:23.320 --> 27:25.320
his hands dainty at his ear,

27:26.040 --> 27:27.960
in every photo,

27:27.960 --> 27:29.800
even group ones at events.

27:30.520 --> 27:34.120
Now I was just grossed out.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.160
So there it is.

27:35.160 --> 27:36.680
That's what this is really about.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.800
In this video, I've gone through a list of gender critical concerns,

27:39.800 --> 27:43.000
and I've provided responses I hope the average person will find fair.

27:43.000 --> 27:44.680
But I would be lying to you by omission,

27:44.680 --> 27:47.720
if I were to end this video without being real with you

27:47.720 --> 27:52.040
about what the core of the gender critical movement is actually about.

27:52.040 --> 27:55.320
See what TERFs do in public is advance what, on the surface,

27:55.320 --> 27:57.880
are a series of feminist critiques of trans people.

27:57.880 --> 28:00.440
For example, the critique that hyperfeminine trans women

28:00.440 --> 28:03.960
are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes designed to oppress women.

28:03.960 --> 28:08.680
At a glance, this appears to be a critique of the way some trans women behave and present themselves.

28:08.680 --> 28:13.720
But in the next breath, these same TERFs will argue that trans women are mannish, unfeminine perverts

28:13.720 --> 28:14.520
who are forcing masturbation on them.

28:14.520 --> 28:18.760
So if trans women being feminine is bad,

28:18.760 --> 28:21.000
and trans women being masculine is bad,

28:21.000 --> 28:25.320
then there really is no way that trans women could behave that TERFs would accept.

28:25.320 --> 28:29.240
So in fact, what TERFs really oppose is not trans women being feminine,

28:29.240 --> 28:31.080
or trans women being masculine,

28:31.080 --> 28:33.720
but trans women being trans women.

28:33.720 --> 28:39.400
In other words, the fundamental issue underlying all these phony concerns is transphobia.

28:39.400 --> 28:42.920
Simple animosity towards trans people's very existence.

28:42.920 --> 28:44.440
And it's pretty easy to recognize,

28:44.440 --> 28:47.240
just from the tone they use when they talk about us.

28:47.240 --> 28:50.280
When you read through the gender-critical subreddit or TERF Twitter,

28:50.280 --> 28:54.280
what you see is just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes

28:54.280 --> 28:59.240
draped over a jagged thorn tangle of visceral disgust and targeted hate.

28:59.240 --> 29:04.120
The pure, exuberant malice of it all is not even disguised in the Germaine Greer quote

29:04.120 --> 29:08.040
from the opening of this video, or in the average gender-critical forum post.

29:08.040 --> 29:11.640
The enormous, knuckly, hairy, beringed paw.

29:11.640 --> 29:14.120
The pancake makeup through which the stubble,

29:14.440 --> 29:15.880
was already burgeoning.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.200
This Neanderthal in his fifties.

29:18.200 --> 29:21.560
Ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.800
Now I was just grossed out.

29:23.800 --> 29:29.640
What gender-critical feminism really amounts to is a baroque palace of rationalizations

29:29.640 --> 29:33.080
built on a foundation of pure disgust.

29:33.080 --> 29:35.640
In this respect, it's just like homophobia.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.240
You know, I came of age when gay marriage was the most contentious social debate,

29:39.240 --> 29:40.840
and the arguments people made,

29:40.840 --> 29:42.280
that marriage was under attack,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.040
that the children would be traumatized,

29:44.040 --> 29:45.880
that bestiality would be next,

29:45.880 --> 29:50.200
that this tiny minority was undermining all our institutions with their outrageous demands,

29:50.200 --> 29:52.360
it was all just nonsense.

29:52.360 --> 29:55.800
If you got a conservative drunk, as I used to be able to do,

29:55.800 --> 29:57.880
Sylvia, I wish I could give you what I had,

29:57.880 --> 29:59.480
he would just blurt out the truth,

29:59.480 --> 30:04.360
which was that the sight of two grown men locking lips made him wanna vom.

30:04.360 --> 30:08.440
Homophobia and transphobia do not originate in the frontal cortex.

30:08.440 --> 30:12.600
They come from the lizard brain disgust response we evolved to deal with blood,

30:12.600 --> 30:13.800
infection, vomit, fear.

30:13.800 --> 30:16.360
It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance,

30:16.360 --> 30:19.960
because it's the same disgust I felt toward myself for years.

30:19.960 --> 30:25.160
It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman on the L platform in Chicago five years ago,

30:25.160 --> 30:28.760
and decided then and there to abandon my first attempt at transition.

30:28.760 --> 30:31.880
It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.

30:31.880 --> 30:34.920
It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,

30:34.920 --> 30:39.240
because transphobia is the only thing that's ever going to stop you from moving forward.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.640
It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,

30:41.640 --> 30:43.640
because transphobia is the only thing that's ever going to stop you from moving forward.

30:43.800 --> 30:44.360
It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,

30:44.360 --> 30:45.640
because transphobia is always the same.

30:45.640 --> 30:50.360
It always comes from the same place, and it's always expressed in the same kinds of ways.

30:50.360 --> 30:54.600
I recently rewatched that classic viral video from an old episode of Cops,

30:54.600 --> 30:59.240
where a police officer humiliates a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.

30:59.240 --> 31:02.840
The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID, misgenders her,

31:02.840 --> 31:06.760
deadnames her, mocks her clothes and makeup, and calls her a cross-dresser.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.920
It's all so repetitive and familiar.

31:08.920 --> 31:12.920
It's the same arsenal of petty sadism you see in the right-wing press,

31:12.920 --> 31:18.200
on 4chan, on doxxing forums, on gender-critical Reddit, it's all the same.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.600
What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair

31:20.600 --> 31:24.440
is her unbreakable wit and confidence in the face of transphobic abuse.

31:24.440 --> 31:26.760
The single most iconic moment is when,

31:26.760 --> 31:31.160
after being grilled in the back of the cop car amid a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering,

31:31.160 --> 31:33.320
she glances back at the cop and says,

31:33.320 --> 31:35.080
Excuse my beauty.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.120
Excuse your beauty.

31:36.120 --> 31:36.760
Okay.

31:36.760 --> 31:42.040
And that, right there, is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture,

31:42.040 --> 31:46.440
the resilience of trans women, the assumption of a regal posture,

31:46.440 --> 31:48.840
and even the most abject conditions.

31:48.840 --> 31:54.200
And that's really all you can do, because there's just no reasoning a transphobe out of bigotry.

31:54.200 --> 31:58.200
So, to any die-hard gender-critical feminists still watching this,

31:58.200 --> 32:01.880
what else can I say except, on behalf of all trans women,

32:01.880 --> 32:03.000
excuse my beauty,

32:03.720 --> 32:04.520
TERF.

32:12.040 --> 32:42.040


32:42.040 --> 32:45.040
Tongue pop is not the solution to every problem.

32:45.040 --> 32:45.880
Or is it?

32:45.880 --> 32:47.220
I posted an invitation to Twitter

32:47.220 --> 32:50.280
for people who used to be gender-critical feminists

32:50.280 --> 32:52.080
to chew me in the back of the head.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.440
It's PC run AMAC.

32:59.860 --> 33:00.700
AMAC.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.320
Look at it.

33:03.320 --> 33:04.160
Okay.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.000
It's so stupid.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.320
It's so stupid.

33:07.320 --> 33:08.540
Run AMAC.

33:08.540 --> 33:10.380
Corona Premier.

33:10.380 --> 33:11.220
See?

33:11.220 --> 33:12.880
Turf beer of choice.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.480
My chromosomes need to unwind

33:14.480 --> 33:16.660
after a hard day of hating trans people.

33:19.600 --> 33:20.820
It is absa...

33:20.820 --> 33:21.660
These titties.

33:21.660 --> 33:23.320
I just saw them and I just lost it.

33:23.320 --> 33:24.160
I just...

33:24.160 --> 33:25.000
It's just...

33:25.000 --> 33:26.020
What?

33:26.020 --> 33:28.560
I-M-A-W-M-B-Y-N.

33:28.560 --> 33:31.320
You do know how I struggle with spelling.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.160
V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

33:36.200 --> 33:39.040
No one knows what it's like

33:39.040 --> 33:40.260
to be a sad,

33:40.260 --> 33:41.680
trian,

33:41.680 --> 33:44.140
to be a trashcan

33:44.140 --> 33:45.500
for trap chasers,

33:45.500 --> 33:46.340
jizz.
