03:58.660 --> 04:00.320
to protect whatever deranged fantasy stories i need to tell myself to make it

04:00.320 --> 04:00.340
stories i need to tell myself to make it

04:00.340 --> 04:01.680
stories i need to tell myself to make it through the night

04:01.680 --> 04:01.700
through the night

04:01.700 --> 04:03.600
through the night it's probably just dry down there they're

04:03.600 --> 04:03.620
it's probably just dry down there they're

04:03.620 --> 04:06.080
it's probably just dry down there they're just ingrown hairs i'm sure plenty of

04:06.080 --> 04:06.100
just ingrown hairs i'm sure plenty of

04:26.160 --> 04:32.600
So look, Shapiro, Benny, baby, I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales, to melt

04:32.600 --> 04:37.800
away every crystal of my snowflakery, and henceforth dispense only the most scalding

04:37.800 --> 04:38.800
tea.

04:38.800 --> 04:39.800
All right, big boy?

04:39.800 --> 04:40.800
Let's have it.

04:40.800 --> 04:44.280
I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner, I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner

04:44.280 --> 04:45.280
a she.

04:45.280 --> 04:46.760
Because you can't change her sex, you can change her name.

04:46.760 --> 04:51.440
Caitlyn Jenner is a man, a biological man, and if he were born with high doses of estrogen

04:51.440 --> 04:54.180
in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman.

04:54.180 --> 04:55.180
You're determined by your chromosomes.

04:55.180 --> 05:00.660
So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype,

05:00.660 --> 05:02.780
that is, XX sex chromosomes.

05:02.780 --> 05:07.620
And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she, and to call you she would

05:07.620 --> 05:09.360
be tantamount to a lie.

05:09.360 --> 05:14.940
I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't like let a transgender

05:14.940 --> 05:17.060
like woman be called she or something.

05:17.060 --> 05:18.380
Because it is a lie.

05:18.380 --> 05:22.700
So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie, and you think that what it means

05:22.700 --> 05:23.700
to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you're not a she.

05:23.700 --> 05:24.700
You're not a she.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.100
You're a normal female karyotype.

05:26.100 --> 05:31.200
And if you think that when we call a trans woman she, we are saying that she has a normal

05:31.200 --> 05:32.560
female karyotype.

05:32.560 --> 05:38.100
But hold on, I'm a transgender woman, and I've never claimed to have a normal female

05:38.100 --> 05:43.280
karyotype, and yet my friends, lovers, and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am,

05:43.280 --> 05:46.220
girlfriend, ladies â€” good girl, good girl.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.320
Just like that.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.320
Don't stop.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.320
Don't stop.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.880
Are all of us deluded about my biology?

05:50.880 --> 05:51.880
No.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.820
It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro.

05:53.820 --> 05:54.100
It's the other way around.

05:54.700 --> 05:57.620
It is you who misunderstands language.

05:57.620 --> 05:59.420
You have deceptively framed the debate

05:59.420 --> 06:02.180
as a debate about biology, which it is not.

06:02.180 --> 06:04.040
We all agree on the biology.

06:04.040 --> 06:07.740
The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words,

06:07.740 --> 06:10.300
such as he, she, man, and woman.

06:10.300 --> 06:13.380
But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word?

06:13.380 --> 06:16.160
Well, there are two kinds of arguments we could make,

06:16.160 --> 06:18.140
descriptive or prescriptive.

06:18.140 --> 06:20.220
If we take the descriptive approach,

06:20.220 --> 06:22.820
then what we must do is act like anthropologists

06:22.820 --> 06:25.680
and study the way a word, for instance, she,

06:25.680 --> 06:27.700
is used by a linguistic community,

06:27.700 --> 06:30.420
and whatever the social convention is is what's correct.

06:30.420 --> 06:32.640
But if we take the prescriptive approach,

06:32.640 --> 06:33.980
then we must make an argument

06:33.980 --> 06:36.980
about the way the word she should be used,

06:36.980 --> 06:38.800
meaning we either defer to an authority,

06:38.800 --> 06:39.960
such as the dictionary,

06:39.960 --> 06:42.220
or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy,

06:42.220 --> 06:44.540
or we must have some goal that we want to accomplish

06:44.540 --> 06:47.880
by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.540
Now, if we take the descriptive approach,

06:49.540 --> 06:52.580
you lose, Ben Shapiro, because most people call me she,

06:52.580 --> 06:53.860
and that's all there is to it.

06:53.860 --> 06:58.820
What's more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical.

06:58.820 --> 07:00.820
You don't put an article before a pronoun.

07:00.820 --> 07:02.960
That's not how pronouns work, you silly dum-dum.

07:02.960 --> 07:06.360
Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905,

07:06.360 --> 07:08.400
while the English pronouns he and she

07:08.400 --> 07:10.240
originate in the Proto-Germanic language

07:10.240 --> 07:12.840
spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe,

07:12.840 --> 07:14.940
beginning around 500 BCE.

07:14.940 --> 07:17.740
Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person

07:17.740 --> 07:19.080
pronouns of the English language

07:19.080 --> 07:20.960
refer specifically to karyotype,

07:20.960 --> 07:22.500
it is you, and not I, who is a she.

07:22.500 --> 07:25.980
I, who is breaking from linguistic tradition, Ben Shapiro.

07:25.980 --> 07:27.960
However, as a trans woman,

07:27.960 --> 07:31.320
it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions.

07:31.320 --> 07:34.120
So, let's try out a prescriptive approach.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.200
Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used,

07:37.200 --> 07:40.660
how do we decide how a word should be used?

07:40.660 --> 07:42.840
Language is by nature ambiguous,

07:42.840 --> 07:44.940
and the way we attempt to disambiguate it

07:44.940 --> 07:47.360
is often motivated by political goals.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.340
Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she,

07:50.340 --> 07:52.500
because his political goal is to reinforce

07:52.500 --> 07:54.420
rigid conservative gender roles.

07:54.420 --> 07:57.820
Whereas, I think we should call trans women she,

07:57.820 --> 08:00.900
because my political goal is to live in a society

08:00.900 --> 08:02.980
where I can achieve the same level of sadness

08:02.980 --> 08:04.840
and dysfunction as everyone else.

08:04.840 --> 08:07.340
It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage

08:07.340 --> 08:08.400
from a decade ago.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.840
Opponents argue the dictionary

08:09.840 --> 08:11.560
and legal definition of marriage

08:11.560 --> 08:13.680
was union between a man and a woman.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.620
And the definition shouldn't be changed,

08:15.620 --> 08:18.740
because it's the definition.

08:18.740 --> 08:21.380
And how am I supposed to explain to my child?

08:21.380 --> 08:22.380
And on the other hand,

08:22.380 --> 08:25.080
Gay people argued that the definition should be changed,

08:25.080 --> 08:27.600
because they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness

08:27.600 --> 08:29.220
and dysfunction as everyone else.

08:29.220 --> 08:31.740
And they succeeded, because as it turns out,

08:31.740 --> 08:34.920
you can in fact change the definitions of words.

08:34.920 --> 08:38.200
The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the Bible.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.240
And for that matter, you can change the Bible.

08:40.240 --> 08:42.900
I mean, have you read the contemporary English version?

08:42.900 --> 08:45.220
The prose is atrocious, appalling.

08:45.220 --> 08:46.320
I won't stand for this.

08:46.320 --> 08:48.360
But unlike the debate about gay marriage,

08:48.360 --> 08:49.980
the question about trans womanhood

08:49.980 --> 08:52.360
is more than just a political and legal dispute.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.300
It seems to me that whatever Church, State,

08:54.300 --> 08:57.300
and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already are,

08:57.300 --> 08:58.960
and will continue to be, women.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.540
And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument

09:01.540 --> 09:05.360
posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime rival, Blair White.

09:05.360 --> 09:09.720
Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whomst is bad.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.920
The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting

09:11.920 --> 09:14.140
his usual position that pronouns are used

09:14.140 --> 09:17.540
to designate so-called biological men and biological women.

09:17.540 --> 09:19.740
Blair responds by observing that Ben's way

09:19.740 --> 09:22.860
of using pronouns is, in her case, completely impractical.

09:22.860 --> 09:25.720
Well, if you and I were to go to a business dinner,

09:25.720 --> 09:27.280
or any kind of dinner, and you were meeting me

09:27.280 --> 09:29.060
at a restaurant, and I was there first,

09:29.060 --> 09:32.080
and I was in an orange shirt, and you had to tell,

09:32.080 --> 09:34.960
you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blair,

09:34.960 --> 09:36.800
and they said, okay, and you had to describe me

09:36.800 --> 09:39.660
to take me to the table, you wouldn't say the man

09:39.660 --> 09:40.880
in the orange shirt, you would say Blair,

09:40.880 --> 09:42.180
you would say her over there.

09:42.180 --> 09:43.700
Ben then responds, saying,

09:43.700 --> 09:44.680
I think there's some truth to that,

09:44.680 --> 09:46.780
meaning that I think that there is a utility

09:46.780 --> 09:49.180
to the use of pronouns, but that's not quite the same

09:49.180 --> 09:52.200
as suggesting that a transgender woman is a she

09:52.200 --> 09:53.340
in the objective sense.

09:53.340 --> 09:54.640
And Blair responds to that

09:54.640 --> 09:56.760
with what I think is a very good analogy.

09:56.760 --> 09:59.020
For instance, if someone were to adopt children,

09:59.020 --> 10:01.500
there's no biological basis for calling them

10:01.500 --> 10:03.200
that kid's parents, because they're not.

10:03.200 --> 10:04.300
Like, they're just literally not,

10:04.300 --> 10:06.160
there's no link at all biologically,

10:06.160 --> 10:08.260
but there is a social reason to do it,

10:08.260 --> 10:09.480
and there's a legal reason to do it.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.080
Let's expand on that analogy.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.580
Suppose you're an adoptive parent,

10:12.580 --> 10:14.020
and you're arguing with someone who says

10:14.020 --> 10:16.600
your adopted child isn't really your child,

10:16.600 --> 10:18.280
and you aren't really a parent.

10:18.280 --> 10:19.180
As evidence, they point out that,

10:19.180 --> 10:21.420
point to the dictionary definition of parent,

10:21.420 --> 10:23.940
one that begets or brings forth offspring.

10:23.940 --> 10:27.100
You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue,

10:27.100 --> 10:29.000
therefore you are not a parent.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.880
Facts don't care about your feelings.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.240
No matter how much you love and care for this child,

10:33.240 --> 10:35.800
you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.

10:35.800 --> 10:38.060
I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument

10:38.060 --> 10:41.280
is being uncivil, yes, being provocative,

10:41.280 --> 10:43.940
controversial, politically incorrect.

10:43.940 --> 10:47.940
But they're not just impolite, they're also wrong.

10:47.940 --> 10:49.180
Because an adoptive parent

10:49.180 --> 10:51.300
is, socially and functionally,

10:51.300 --> 10:54.180
just as real a parent as a biological parent.

10:54.180 --> 10:57.640
And to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.460
So, what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?

11:00.460 --> 11:02.400
I would say that we actually do have different descriptions

11:02.400 --> 11:04.300
for adoptive parents than biological parents, right?

11:04.300 --> 11:06.340
You'll say in shorthand that they're parents,

11:06.340 --> 11:07.900
because they're all different types of parents,

11:07.900 --> 11:09.980
but we do say adoptive parents.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.680
Right, adoptive parents,

11:11.680 --> 11:13.800
an entirely valid type of parent.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.560
To call them parents is not a lie.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.020
And then the question becomes, okay, exactly, is the,

11:19.020 --> 11:21.820
the context that you were suggesting matters?

11:21.820 --> 11:23.560
In what context are we talking about the parents?

11:23.560 --> 11:24.860
Are we talking about a PTA meeting?

11:24.860 --> 11:26.840
Okay, this person is the legal guardian,

11:26.840 --> 11:28.580
and therefore the parent,

11:28.580 --> 11:30.000
because parenting has two aspects, right?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.620
There's the biological parentage,

11:31.620 --> 11:33.840
and then there is the actual role of parenting.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.620
So yes, there are some contexts

11:35.620 --> 11:36.840
where we do need to distinguish

11:36.840 --> 11:38.960
between biological and adoptive parents.

11:38.960 --> 11:41.400
For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk

11:41.400 --> 11:43.140
of some hereditary disease,

11:43.140 --> 11:46.220
they need to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.

11:46.220 --> 11:48.760
But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts,

11:48.760 --> 11:50.580
it doesn't matter in the slightest.

11:50.580 --> 11:51.840
In the dinner conversation,

11:51.840 --> 11:53.320
the same thing sort of holds true,

11:53.320 --> 11:55.140
meaning there is the biological role of woman,

11:55.140 --> 11:56.020
which you are not,

11:56.020 --> 11:58.160
and then there is the, you look like a woman,

11:58.160 --> 12:00.340
which is, I'm gonna describe you as a woman to the waiter

12:00.340 --> 12:01.800
when he comes to direct me to the table.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.420
Just when Ben seems on the cusp

12:03.420 --> 12:04.600
of having a breakthrough,

12:04.600 --> 12:06.360
he and Blair pause their argument

12:06.360 --> 12:09.780
to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.

12:09.780 --> 12:10.600
From what I've seen,

12:10.600 --> 12:13.380
a lot of your interactions with trans people,

12:13.380 --> 12:15.380
they always end up kind of ugly.

12:15.380 --> 12:16.220
You know what I mean?

12:16.220 --> 12:17.060
There was the, I think,

12:17.060 --> 12:18.600
I think the person's name was Zoe Turr,

12:18.600 --> 12:20.660
there was the threat of physical violence.

12:20.660 --> 12:22.360
What are your genetics, sir?

12:22.360 --> 12:25.640
You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.060
Yeah, I mean, what's hilarious about this, Blair,

12:27.060 --> 12:28.820
is literally the exact same thing

12:28.820 --> 12:30.140
that I'm saying to you right now

12:30.140 --> 12:33.080
is exactly what I said to Zoe Turr on the air.

12:33.080 --> 12:35.460
But that's not exactly true, is it, Ben?

12:35.460 --> 12:38.260
Zoe threatened you after you called her sir,

12:38.260 --> 12:40.620
and you didn't call Blair sir, did you?

12:40.620 --> 12:42.360
Why did you call Zoe sir?

12:42.360 --> 12:45.260
What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit,

12:45.260 --> 12:47.960
oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?

12:47.960 --> 12:50.340
I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.

12:50.340 --> 12:53.860
I suppose sir is a strictly biological term.

12:53.860 --> 12:56.120
Queen Guinevere said in days of old,

12:56.120 --> 13:00.400
I knight thee, Lancelot, thou that art karyotypically male.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.240
And you're exactly right.

13:01.240 --> 13:04.740
When people start yelling at each other or tweeting out F you,

13:04.740 --> 13:06.060
that's not a great way to change my mind.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.640
It turns out that's not particularly convincing.

13:07.640 --> 13:11.080
So what is a great way to change your mind, Ben Shapiro?

13:11.080 --> 13:13.720
Did Blair bud you an inch with her rationality,

13:13.720 --> 13:16.960
her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?

13:16.960 --> 13:17.960
It doesn't seem like she's going to change your mind.

13:17.960 --> 13:18.880
She did.

13:18.880 --> 13:19.960
At the end of this debate,

13:19.960 --> 13:23.180
you regurgitate your original position undigested.

13:23.180 --> 13:24.620
You know, I'm the editor of a pretty major site,

13:24.620 --> 13:26.200
and my basic rule is that

13:26.200 --> 13:27.640
when we're discussing people who are trans,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.440
we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman,

13:29.440 --> 13:31.480
and then refers to them by their biological pronoun,

13:31.480 --> 13:33.820
because biology is the nature of the pronoun.

13:33.820 --> 13:36.300
Biology is the nature of the pronouns?

13:36.300 --> 13:38.080
Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you

13:38.080 --> 13:40.460
that in most contexts that's not true for her?

13:40.460 --> 13:42.960
Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.300
There are some contexts where it makes sense

13:45.300 --> 13:47.140
to distinguish between adoptive parents

13:47.960 --> 13:48.960
and adoptive parents.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.660
Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts

13:51.660 --> 13:53.180
where it makes sense to distinguish

13:53.180 --> 13:55.460
between transgender and cisgender,

13:55.460 --> 13:58.100
or as you say, biological women.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.140
For instance, when discussing who needs access

14:00.140 --> 14:01.660
to certain reproductive healthcare

14:01.660 --> 14:03.220
you think should be illegal.

14:03.220 --> 14:05.260
But does this apply to pronouns?

14:05.260 --> 14:08.240
That is, are pronouns technical biological terms

14:08.240 --> 14:10.000
denoting karyotypes,

14:10.000 --> 14:11.860
or are they part of the everyday language

14:11.860 --> 14:13.920
we use to describe each other socially?

14:13.920 --> 14:15.820
The answer is obvious.

14:15.820 --> 14:17.960
There are no geneticists studying pronouns.

14:17.960 --> 14:20.600
In fact, there is not a single biology textbook

14:20.600 --> 14:22.260
with a chapter on the difference between

14:22.260 --> 14:24.700
a he and a she.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.200
There is no such thing as biological pronouns.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.920
This is a phrase invented in the last decade

14:29.920 --> 14:32.440
to describe the misgendering of trans people.

14:32.440 --> 14:33.920
So as a trans woman,

14:33.920 --> 14:37.260
I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.

14:37.260 --> 14:40.140
She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me,

14:40.140 --> 14:41.860
regardless of my anatomy,

14:41.860 --> 14:44.220
which is none of your business, Ben Shapiro.

14:44.220 --> 14:46.120
Fascinating though it is.

14:46.120 --> 14:46.960
And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother,

14:46.960 --> 14:47.960
that she is a trans woman,

14:47.960 --> 14:50.260
that her son is not her child,

14:50.260 --> 14:53.360
to call me he is not just rude or insensitive.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.820
It is, in effect, false.

14:55.820 --> 14:58.100
But it is also rude and insensitive.

14:58.100 --> 15:00.380
So even if you don't agree with me,

15:00.380 --> 15:01.880
you could still not.

15:01.880 --> 15:03.040
What's the harm, right?

15:03.040 --> 15:04.580
I teach my almost four year old girl

15:04.580 --> 15:06.480
that she can become a boy.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.880
Then I think that is not only lying to her,

15:07.880 --> 15:08.720
I think it's confusing her

15:08.720 --> 15:10.260
and I think it's damaging to her psyche.

15:10.260 --> 15:12.160
Oh yes, the classic argument.

15:12.160 --> 15:14.300
How do I explain to my child?

15:14.300 --> 15:16.480
Kill your shitty child for all I care.

15:16.480 --> 15:17.640
That's simply not my problem.

15:17.640 --> 15:20.400
I regret every night I spent with you, Ben Shapiro.

15:20.400 --> 15:23.040
I'm in a new relationship now with a lesbian.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.600
You and I are through.

15:24.600 --> 15:27.200
I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.680
It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.

15:36.680 --> 15:39.260
I won't allow my children to watch movies

15:39.260 --> 15:43.100
unless there's at least a bloodbath or maybe an orgy.

15:43.100 --> 15:45.380
But hey, I don't choose this schlock.

15:45.380 --> 15:46.500
I just present it.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.580
The second program

15:47.640 --> 15:50.000
of tonight's science fiction double feature

15:50.000 --> 15:51.420
is about a cult of chaos,

15:51.420 --> 15:54.480
hell bent on destroying Western civilization.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.140
I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.

16:01.820 --> 16:04.340
Hi boys, it's points again.

16:04.340 --> 16:06.540
Same queen, new look, try to keep up.

16:06.540 --> 16:09.560
In my previous video, nasty tea babe likes it rough,

16:09.560 --> 16:11.420
I made an argument about why it's correct

16:11.420 --> 16:12.920
to call trans women she,

16:12.920 --> 16:13.980
but I'd be bullshitting you

16:13.980 --> 16:17.000
if I only discussed fully integrated binary trans people.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.880
Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.

16:19.880 --> 16:22.760
Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort

16:22.760 --> 16:24.940
to continue the charade of misgendering them.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.720
The transgender woman from Orange is the New Black.

16:27.720 --> 16:28.560
I never watched that show.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.480
I've never watched that show either,

16:29.480 --> 16:30.760
but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.

16:30.760 --> 16:31.600
Oh.

16:31.600 --> 16:32.600
Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.

16:34.880 --> 16:36.720
I limited my argument to trans women

16:36.720 --> 16:39.520
who look the way society expects a woman to look

16:39.520 --> 16:43.000
because cis people have an easier time making sense of that.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.400
But the reality is that in a lot of cases,

16:45.400 --> 16:46.840
it's a little more complicated.

16:46.840 --> 16:49.600
Now, as far as early transition trans people go,

16:49.600 --> 16:51.480
I am fairly integrated.

16:51.480 --> 16:53.880
Society basically gets that I'm a woman.

16:53.880 --> 16:55.800
Without me having to explain my gender,

16:55.800 --> 16:59.360
strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.

16:59.360 --> 17:02.040
Hey, haven't I seen your videos on tgirllove.com?

17:02.040 --> 17:04.600
But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.

17:04.600 --> 17:08.280
I got called sir last week by the cashier at H&M.

17:08.280 --> 17:10.720
Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M,

17:10.720 --> 17:13.200
but needless to say, it was a desperate emergency.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.600
And by emergency, I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's.

17:16.840 --> 17:18.880
What happened next stays between me and the Lord,

17:18.880 --> 17:22.480
but suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched in-

17:24.480 --> 17:26.360
Okay, I embellished the story a little.

17:26.360 --> 17:27.400
He wasn't cute.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.040
So between being six foot one,

17:29.040 --> 17:30.800
the horrific transsexual squawking

17:30.800 --> 17:32.560
I try to pass off as my voice,

17:32.560 --> 17:34.760
and my tragic inability to conduct myself

17:34.760 --> 17:36.880
in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding,

17:36.880 --> 17:38.000
your girl remains,

17:38.000 --> 17:40.440
despite my desperate, painstaking efforts,

17:40.440 --> 17:41.680
somewhat clockable.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.320
You look great, hun.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.960
In that debate between Ben and Blair,

17:45.960 --> 17:46.800
Blair says that

17:46.840 --> 17:49.080
pronoun usage boils down to what you look like.

17:49.080 --> 17:52.080
But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.920
And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you

17:54.920 --> 17:56.680
largely based on your appearance.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.400
So appearance definitely matters,

17:58.400 --> 17:59.840
but in my opinion, passing,

17:59.840 --> 18:01.680
in the sense of looking like a cis woman,

18:01.680 --> 18:03.680
is really the most important thing.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.760
What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give off,

18:06.760 --> 18:10.760
the way you speak, the gestures, the conversational dynamic.

18:10.760 --> 18:12.680
That kind of stuff to me is what makes a person

18:12.680 --> 18:15.040
viscerally seem like a man or a woman.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.480
So my goal isn't necessarily

18:16.480 --> 18:19.080
to serve unclockable fish,

18:19.080 --> 18:21.240
so much as to embody a certain kind of

18:21.240 --> 18:23.880
diaphanous archetypal femininity.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.880
In layman's terms, girl dick energy.

18:25.880 --> 18:29.080
Also, I am gonna have a lot of plastic surgery, thank God.

18:29.080 --> 18:30.480
Last month, I released a video called

18:30.480 --> 18:33.000
Sexy Furry Pounded by Skinny T-Babe.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.760
And a lot of trans people got mad at me

18:34.760 --> 18:36.480
because they thought I was saying

18:36.480 --> 18:39.080
that performing your gender is the only thing that matters

18:39.080 --> 18:41.120
and that how you identify counts for nothing.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.600
But that's not what I think.

18:42.600 --> 18:45.120
I do prefer to argue that trans women are women

18:45.120 --> 18:46.320
because we live the lives of them,

18:46.320 --> 18:49.440
because I think that's a much more compelling argument

18:49.440 --> 18:52.280
than I'm a woman because I psychologically identify

18:52.280 --> 18:54.320
as a woman, which in my experience

18:54.320 --> 18:55.680
doesn't really persuade anyone.

18:55.680 --> 18:57.360
It's just too easy to poke holes in it.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.320
But identity definitely does matter,

18:59.320 --> 19:00.760
especially when it comes to pronouns.

19:00.760 --> 19:01.640
And I'll explain why.

19:01.640 --> 19:04.920
Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people

19:04.920 --> 19:07.800
are very sensitive about anyone telling them

19:07.800 --> 19:09.080
what pronouns to use.

19:09.080 --> 19:12.040
So I'm gonna try to be respectful of your feelings

19:12.040 --> 19:14.400
and what a difficult and personal issue

19:14.400 --> 19:15.440
this must be for you.

19:15.440 --> 19:16.280
After all,

19:16.320 --> 19:18.120
we live in a repressive political era

19:18.120 --> 19:20.160
despite the best efforts of hero professor,

19:20.160 --> 19:21.400
Jordan B. Peterson.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.320
But alas, he was too late.

19:23.320 --> 19:25.960
Now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech

19:25.960 --> 19:27.480
and sends people to jail for,

19:27.480 --> 19:30.440
oh, it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed?

19:30.440 --> 19:33.200
Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail

19:33.200 --> 19:34.560
for pronoun misuse.

19:46.320 --> 19:51.320
Oh, I guess that was a false alarm, huh?

19:51.440 --> 19:53.080
God damn it.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.960
Look, I'm not gonna tell you what pronouns you have to use.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.080
I'm just gonna tell you how I use pronouns

19:58.080 --> 19:59.360
and my reasoning behind it.

19:59.360 --> 20:01.720
And you are welcome to use your free speech

20:01.720 --> 20:05.200
to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you wanna be.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.040
Okay?

20:06.040 --> 20:07.800
So back to identity.

20:07.800 --> 20:12.120
If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets

20:12.120 --> 20:15.120
and a customer were to walk in looking like this,

20:15.120 --> 20:16.120
I might ordinarily defend myself.

20:16.120 --> 20:18.040
I might ordinarily default to female pronouns,

20:18.040 --> 20:19.840
but that would be wrong.

20:19.840 --> 20:22.720
Since I happen to know this person is not only a man,

20:22.720 --> 20:24.640
he is the man.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.000
YouTube's most regal makeup artist,

20:27.000 --> 20:28.840
his lordship, John McClane,

20:28.840 --> 20:31.160
and he uses he, him pronouns.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.680
Likewise, if I were approached by this person,

20:33.680 --> 20:36.800
I'd fall in love and then default to female pronouns.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.600
And this time I'd be correct,

20:38.600 --> 20:41.520
but not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,

20:41.520 --> 20:44.440
but because she's gender fluid drag queen, Courtney Act,

20:44.440 --> 20:45.880
who has the fucking audacity

20:45.880 --> 20:47.760
to be a more beautiful woman than I am,

20:47.760 --> 20:48.960
and who, so far as I know,

20:48.960 --> 20:50.880
uses male pronouns in boy mode

20:50.880 --> 20:53.880
and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.280
A lot of the complexities of gender, language,

20:56.280 --> 20:59.400
identity, and expression get played out in the world of drag.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.320
Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men

21:02.320 --> 21:04.520
who live as men and perform as women.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.600
Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon,

21:07.600 --> 21:11.280
Shea Coulee, and Violet Tchotchke, identify as non-binary.

21:11.280 --> 21:13.040
Others still are bio queens,

21:13.040 --> 21:15.200
cis women who perform as drag queens,

21:15.880 --> 21:20.000
and then there are trans women who are also drag queens,

21:20.000 --> 21:23.640
like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or, for that matter, me.

21:23.640 --> 21:24.600
I mean, look at me.

21:24.600 --> 21:25.600
Do you think I dress like this

21:25.600 --> 21:27.560
when I go to 7-Eleven at 2 a.m.?

21:27.560 --> 21:28.600
Because I do.

21:28.600 --> 21:32.400
Look what I've become, a bisexual, transsexual drag queen.

21:32.400 --> 21:34.640
Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake.

21:34.640 --> 21:36.720
I just, through pure coincidence,

21:36.720 --> 21:38.080
happened to be the most interesting

21:38.080 --> 21:39.480
and unique person who ever lived.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.240
I am so sorry, I can't help it.

21:41.240 --> 21:42.520
So let's recap.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.040
There are gender non-conforming men

21:44.040 --> 21:45.080
who present very femme,

21:45.080 --> 21:46.480
but use male pronouns.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.520
There are cis men who use female pronouns

21:48.520 --> 21:50.120
whenever they present female.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.440
There are gender-fluid people who use different pronouns

21:52.440 --> 21:54.360
depending on their current presentation.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.080
There are pre-transition trans people

21:56.080 --> 21:57.520
who identify as a gender

21:57.520 --> 21:59.400
other than the one they present and live as,

21:59.400 --> 22:00.960
and prefer other pronouns.

22:00.960 --> 22:03.880
So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks,

22:03.880 --> 22:05.320
because there's a lot of situations

22:05.320 --> 22:07.720
where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.

22:07.720 --> 22:11.800
So, as you can see, identity definitely is important,

22:11.800 --> 22:14.360
but it's also not the only thing that matters.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.840
If trans identity were the only thing that mattered,

22:17.840 --> 22:19.720
then there would be no need for a trans person

22:19.720 --> 22:21.920
to come out or do anything to transition,

22:21.920 --> 22:24.240
including requesting different pronouns,

22:24.240 --> 22:27.200
because pronouns belong to the social world of language,

22:27.200 --> 22:29.400
not to individual psychology.

22:29.400 --> 22:33.120
This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.280
You can identify however you like,

22:35.280 --> 22:38.480
but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.

22:38.480 --> 22:40.840
So if, for example, you're a trans woman

22:40.840 --> 22:42.320
still living as a man,

22:42.320 --> 22:43.880
then you are fully trans,

22:43.880 --> 22:45.040
your identity is fully valid,

22:45.080 --> 22:47.720
but until you begin living as a woman,

22:47.720 --> 22:50.760
your womanhood remains kind of hypothetical.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.360
And when I say living as a woman,

22:52.360 --> 22:53.960
I don't mean passing.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.400
There's too much emphasis on physical appearance,

22:56.400 --> 22:58.680
and not enough on social relationships.

22:58.680 --> 22:59.760
You know, you don't become a woman

22:59.760 --> 23:01.440
the first time you put on a dress.

23:01.440 --> 23:03.000
You become a woman the first time

23:03.000 --> 23:05.360
an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant

23:05.360 --> 23:07.840
and says, maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.280
My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.

23:10.280 --> 23:11.360
As far as I'm concerned,

23:11.360 --> 23:13.400
if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet,

23:13.400 --> 23:14.880
they are fully trans.

23:15.080 --> 23:17.320
I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact

23:17.320 --> 23:19.440
that a lot of people's gendered experience

23:19.440 --> 23:21.960
isn't entirely a product of how they identify.

23:21.960 --> 23:22.840
Put it this way,

23:22.840 --> 23:25.520
I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman,

23:25.520 --> 23:28.600
but my thought process behind it isn't always the same.

23:28.600 --> 23:31.320
Many trans women just seem like women to me,

23:31.320 --> 23:34.600
in literally the same way that cis women seem like women.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.880
And I use female pronouns for them effortlessly,

23:36.880 --> 23:38.560
just as I was trained to do from birth.

23:38.560 --> 23:41.880
This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.

23:41.880 --> 23:44.560
We want not necessarily to pass perfectly,

23:45.080 --> 23:47.960
just to seem like our genders to the people around us.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.480
As Laura Jane Grace put it,

23:49.480 --> 23:52.240
you want them to see you like they see every other girl.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.800
I want people calling me she not out of politeness

23:54.800 --> 23:57.880
or respect for my identity as a trans woman,

23:57.880 --> 24:00.280
but just because I seem like a woman to them.

24:00.280 --> 24:01.960
Because the reality is,

24:01.960 --> 24:05.120
not all trans women seem like a woman to me

24:05.120 --> 24:06.640
in that visceral way,

24:06.640 --> 24:09.160
and I live with this constant crushing anxiety

24:09.160 --> 24:11.440
that I don't seem like a woman to other people.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.920
I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen,

24:13.920 --> 24:15.240
and I cope with that fear

24:15.240 --> 24:17.400
by looking like a second-rate drag queen.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.160
But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears

24:20.160 --> 24:23.560
a 0% woman, if she tells me she's a trans woman,

24:23.560 --> 24:26.520
I'm gonna use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.480
Not just to be polite,

24:28.480 --> 24:30.920
but also because I wanna recognize the reality

24:30.920 --> 24:32.640
of her psychological experience,

24:32.640 --> 24:35.800
and especially because I wanna help her re-socialize

24:35.800 --> 24:38.360
and reintegrate into the world as her true gender.

24:38.360 --> 24:40.080
And of course, cis people,

24:40.080 --> 24:43.160
you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that,

24:43.920 --> 24:47.120
but if you refuse, you are being a shit-gibbon.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.680
And I would prefer that you not be a shit-gibbon.

24:49.680 --> 24:52.960
Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.760
An increasing number of people identify

24:54.760 --> 24:57.440
not as male or female, but as non-binary,

24:57.440 --> 25:00.360
an umbrella term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels

25:00.360 --> 25:02.920
such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,

25:02.920 --> 25:04.520
graygender, and so on.

25:04.520 --> 25:06.920
Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.800
In English, usually they.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.120
Now, if your first impulse is to argue

25:10.120 --> 25:12.400
that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense,

25:12.400 --> 25:15.400
consider that having gendered singular third-person pronouns

25:15.400 --> 25:18.440
at all is a particular feature of the English language

25:18.440 --> 25:20.840
that's by no means shared by all other languages,

25:20.840 --> 25:23.000
including Turkish, Korean, and Finnish,

25:23.000 --> 25:24.280
which don't have them at all.

25:24.280 --> 25:25.880
Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds

25:25.880 --> 25:26.840
coming out of your mouth

25:26.840 --> 25:28.840
that humans make up to suit our purposes.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.440
If you're new to using singular they,

25:30.440 --> 25:32.040
it is a little confusing at first,

25:32.040 --> 25:34.360
but with some practice, it gets pretty easy.

25:34.360 --> 25:35.840
They poured milk on me.

25:35.840 --> 25:37.280
I poured milk on them.

25:37.280 --> 25:39.080
They did anoint themself in their milk,

25:39.080 --> 25:40.960
and it was good, thus saith the Lord.

25:40.960 --> 25:42.360
So the polite thing to do here,

25:42.360 --> 25:44.960
is easy, if someone asks you to call them they,

25:44.960 --> 25:46.040
you call them they.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.560
But if you're like me,

25:47.560 --> 25:49.000
you don't wanna just do a thing

25:49.000 --> 25:52.000
because you dogmatically believe it's the woke thing to do.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.400
You wanna understand why you're doing it.

25:54.400 --> 25:57.200
I don't just wanna tolerate non-binary people.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.720
I want to be a convert.

25:58.720 --> 26:00.280
I wanna believe about them

26:00.280 --> 26:01.800
what they believe about themselves,

26:01.800 --> 26:03.680
so long as those beliefs are reasonable.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.440
So what do all these words mean?

26:05.440 --> 26:07.080
What are these people talking about?

26:07.080 --> 26:09.600
Remember earlier, we distinguished gender expression

26:09.600 --> 26:10.720
from gender identity.

26:10.720 --> 26:12.000
John McClane is feminine

26:12.000 --> 26:14.400
in expression, but a man in identity.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.560
Whereas I am a woman in identity,

26:16.560 --> 26:18.640
and in expression, I am a mess.

26:18.640 --> 26:21.080
Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's

26:21.080 --> 26:23.840
great contributions to humanity, art, science,

26:23.840 --> 26:27.520
spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futsch scale.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.120
The Futsch scale is a diagram that looks like this

26:30.120 --> 26:32.000
and quantifies from one to 10,

26:32.000 --> 26:33.680
or high femme to stone butch,

26:33.680 --> 26:35.760
the gender expression of a given domain,

26:35.760 --> 26:38.840
such as Mulan looks or Steven Universe characters.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.640
It can also be used more abstractly for weapons,

26:42.000 --> 26:43.880
Pokemon, or wind instruments.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.080
Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do

26:46.080 --> 26:49.520
with words like genderqueer, agender, graygender, and so on

26:49.520 --> 26:52.800
is to give to identity the same kind of specificity

26:52.800 --> 26:54.720
the Futsch scale gives to expression.

26:54.720 --> 26:57.520
But my input on this isn't really worth that much

26:57.520 --> 26:59.040
because I'm not non-binary.

26:59.040 --> 26:59.920
And to tell you the truth,

26:59.920 --> 27:01.800
I kind of feel for cis people here

27:01.800 --> 27:04.640
because all this talk about gender identity,

27:04.640 --> 27:07.520
a lot of the time, I don't really get it either.

27:07.520 --> 27:09.320
I look inside myself and ask,

27:09.320 --> 27:11.400
do I feel like a man or a woman?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.360
And over these years,

27:13.360 --> 27:16.000
the answer is still that I feel like shit.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.880
And that's how I experience gender.

27:17.880 --> 27:20.240
I live, I exist as a woman,

27:20.240 --> 27:21.640
which is the only way I can achieve

27:21.640 --> 27:24.720
the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.

27:24.720 --> 27:27.040
And I identify as trash.

27:27.040 --> 27:28.640
I guess there are certain moments

27:28.640 --> 27:30.400
that make me feel like a natural woman.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.760
Oh, listening to Aretha Franklin,

27:32.760 --> 27:35.160
the pain and ecstasy of penetration,

27:35.160 --> 27:37.320
waiting in a long ass line for the restroom,

27:37.320 --> 27:39.520
a big strong arm around my waist,

27:39.520 --> 27:41.880
being asked if I have any tampons, having tampons,

27:42.000 --> 27:43.560
in case someone asks,

27:43.560 --> 27:46.000
a dude explaining philosophy 101 to me

27:46.000 --> 27:47.920
and me going, oh really?

27:47.920 --> 27:49.040
Wow.

27:49.040 --> 27:49.880
But you know,

27:49.880 --> 27:52.120
these experiences mean different things to different people.

27:52.120 --> 27:54.040
So all I can really tell you is that

27:54.040 --> 27:58.280
I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures,

27:58.280 --> 27:59.640
that taking female hormones

27:59.640 --> 28:01.440
and having feminizing medical procedures

28:01.440 --> 28:03.440
makes me feel more at home in my body,

28:03.440 --> 28:06.000
and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman,

28:06.000 --> 28:08.480
socially, spiritually, sexually.

28:08.480 --> 28:10.680
So that's the jargon-free explanation of my gender

28:10.680 --> 28:11.600
as I see it.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.600
I don't even know what that would mean,

28:13.600 --> 28:15.920
but I do know that the life I live as a woman

28:15.920 --> 28:17.600
is the only life I have,

28:17.600 --> 28:20.480
and that, I think, is legitimate enough.

28:20.480 --> 28:23.240
So, I know what living as a woman means to me,

28:23.240 --> 28:25.720
but what does it mean to live a non-binary life?

28:25.720 --> 28:28.480
Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman,

28:28.480 --> 28:29.800
that's something that's gonna vary

28:29.800 --> 28:31.800
between individuals and cultures.

28:31.800 --> 28:34.120
Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions,

28:34.120 --> 28:36.040
such as the Hydra of South Asia,

28:36.040 --> 28:38.400
a local tribe that was born in the Middle East,

28:38.400 --> 28:40.040
and some of them have a lot of history

28:40.040 --> 28:41.440
that has been passed down for generations.

28:41.440 --> 28:43.480
In Asia, a legally recognized gender

28:43.480 --> 28:46.240
in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh

28:46.240 --> 28:47.880
wore the various two-spirit traditions

28:47.880 --> 28:49.920
of indigenous North American tribes.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.520
Non-indigenous American culture

28:51.520 --> 28:53.520
doesn't have a third gender tradition,

28:53.520 --> 28:56.040
but we do have individual non-binary people,

28:56.040 --> 28:57.600
some of whom are making content

28:57.600 --> 29:00.040
that has taught me a lot about non-binary experience,

29:00.040 --> 29:02.760
non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.

29:02.760 --> 29:04.000
We have a lot in common,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.080
binary and non-binary trans people.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.960
Even as a binary trans person,

29:07.960 --> 29:09.560
I used to live as one gender,

29:09.560 --> 29:11.080
and now I live as another gender.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.800
In itself is a pretty serious challenge

29:13.800 --> 29:15.440
to the stability of the binary,

29:15.440 --> 29:17.920
but many of the people who call themselves non-binary

29:17.920 --> 29:20.160
seem to be fighting for something more radical

29:20.160 --> 29:21.400
than what I'm fighting for,

29:21.400 --> 29:22.880
at least in my personal life.

29:22.880 --> 29:24.200
I'm just trying to assimilate

29:24.200 --> 29:26.320
into a pre-existing female gender role.

29:28.080 --> 29:30.440
As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed,

29:30.440 --> 29:32.840
the traditional female garb of my culture.

29:35.960 --> 29:36.800
No!

29:36.800 --> 29:38.280
Whereas non-binary people

29:38.280 --> 29:40.800
are trying to cast off these roles entirely,

29:41.440 --> 29:44.440
trying to create the society that includes them.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.480
And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes

29:46.480 --> 29:49.080
with some non-binary people who, for example,

29:49.080 --> 29:52.200
promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.920
Whereas, I love it when people assume my gender,

29:54.920 --> 29:57.160
provided they assume it correctly.

29:57.160 --> 29:58.880
Otherwise, I will throw you

29:58.880 --> 30:01.200
an imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.400
But what we all agree on is that many trans,

30:03.400 --> 30:05.680
non-binary, and gender non-conforming people

30:05.680 --> 30:08.640
find it easier to navigate the world using pronouns

30:08.640 --> 30:11.160
other than the ones that Ben Shapiro wants you to use.

30:11.440 --> 30:12.840
If you want me to call you they,

30:12.840 --> 30:14.080
I'm gonna call you they.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.200
And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer,

30:17.200 --> 30:19.000
to do or say anything,

30:19.000 --> 30:22.280
I do hope you use your free will to freely choose

30:22.280 --> 30:25.640
to use your freedom of speech to choose to do the same.

30:25.640 --> 30:26.480
Freely.

30:33.640 --> 30:36.880
Wow, at least there was a hideous monster this time.

30:36.880 --> 30:39.000
I'm talking about the female lead.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.480
Pfft, pfft.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.200
The show's over.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.200
I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor.

30:46.200 --> 30:48.960
So goodbye, my satanic subscribers.

30:48.960 --> 30:50.200
Until next week,

30:52.280 --> 30:53.520
go to hell.

31:11.440 --> 31:22.280
Oh, oh, oh, this is who I am, yeah, oh.

31:22.280 --> 31:33.280
We'll go hang in heaven, in heaven, in heaven.

31:41.440 --> 31:53.840
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
