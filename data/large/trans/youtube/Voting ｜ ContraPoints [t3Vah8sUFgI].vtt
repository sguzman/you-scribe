WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:16.800
Children, if I have to crawl off the goddamn floor on the morning of November 4th, brush

00:16.800 --> 00:22.600
aside the empty wine bottles, and pick up my phone to discover that Caligula Jackson

00:22.600 --> 00:31.520
is president for life, I am going to chew my way through the bathroom tile, and I will

00:31.520 --> 00:34.500
not stop until I reach the gates of hell.

00:36.860 --> 00:37.940
You know what, America?

00:38.260 --> 00:41.340
Things have not gone well.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.080
We're having a hard time.

00:43.160 --> 00:43.600
We are.

00:43.600 --> 00:49.980
Between the plague, the quarantine, the oppressive policing, the unrest in the streets, the rising

00:49.980 --> 00:52.600
tide of fascism, the criminalization.

00:52.600 --> 00:57.200
Criminal negligence of a president who's refused to admit the danger of a disease that

00:57.200 --> 00:59.720
has killed 200,000 people and counting.

01:00.440 --> 01:04.440
Of course, there's going to be some trumpet in the comments saying, it's not that big

01:04.440 --> 01:04.860
a deal.

01:05.020 --> 01:06.240
Calm down.

01:07.520 --> 01:09.700
People die all the time.

01:09.960 --> 01:13.400
Funny, that's not what she said about Benghazi.

01:13.600 --> 01:16.640
We kind of need a hero to lead us out of the darkness.

01:17.300 --> 01:22.040
And unfortunately, Uncle Joe is not really the man for the job.

01:22.040 --> 01:27.680
I was a Bernie supporter and I regret not being more vocal about it when I had the chance.

01:27.680 --> 01:30.160
So this time, I'm going to say something.

01:30.160 --> 01:34.920
Because even though Biden is not my boy, I still think that dethroning Trump by electing

01:34.920 --> 01:38.920
Biden is the single most important thing any American can do right now.

01:38.920 --> 01:42.460
So allow me to make my case gorge.

01:42.460 --> 01:46.600
By now leftist Twitter has already seen the title of this video and I'm sure they're firing

01:46.600 --> 01:48.360
off hot takes as we speak.

01:48.360 --> 01:49.880
Typical T-Thought Normie Radlib endorses the election of Donald Trump.

01:49.880 --> 01:50.880
I don't know if that's the right word.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.880
I don't know.

01:51.880 --> 01:52.880
I don't know.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.880
I don't know.

01:53.880 --> 01:54.880
I don't know.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.880
I haven't seen the current electoral farce.

01:55.880 --> 01:56.880
Is this your leftist queen of YouTube?

01:56.880 --> 02:00.520
Looks more like a rich Karen who'd rather complain about canceled culture than revolt

02:00.520 --> 02:03.000
against the neoliberal status quo.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Tabby chan.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Tabby chan.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.120
You know what, Tabitha?

02:06.120 --> 02:08.820
For once I'm actually going to take the bait.

02:08.820 --> 02:13.480
So this will be a conversation with the communist Twitter cat girl that lives in my brain.

02:13.480 --> 02:14.520
Ne-aw.

02:14.520 --> 02:20.040
I'm making this video because my timeline is full of leftist 22-year-olds who are so

02:20.040 --> 02:21.320
disillusioned with . . .

02:21.320 --> 02:25.880
that system that they intend not to vote in this election and yeah some of them are probably

02:25.880 --> 02:31.800
russian bots but that's fine maybe i can win over the russian bot vote so i really do understand

02:31.800 --> 02:36.920
the perspective that biden is not worth voting for because that was also my first reflex when

02:36.920 --> 02:42.760
he was nominated but on reflection i think to throw away this vote would be a terrible mistake

02:42.760 --> 02:47.320
don't make me in my bathroom tile children there's probably asbestos in that tile because america's

02:47.320 --> 02:52.680
so great even the floor is made of poison okay tabby chan give me your worst i want free health

02:52.680 --> 02:58.200
care student debt cancelled and worker ownership of the means of production biden won't give us

02:58.200 --> 03:01.880
any of that and i don't want to vote for someone who won't actually change things

03:02.440 --> 03:07.640
well listen tabby chan none of us want to vote for joe biden i don't want to vote for joe biden

03:07.640 --> 03:13.080
any more than i want to retile my bathroom but sometimes a situation gets so toxic and so

03:13.080 --> 03:17.240
dangerous well you have no choice but to get your hands dirty and in this election

03:17.320 --> 03:24.200
i consider a vote for biden primarily a vote against trump you know voting for a politician

03:24.200 --> 03:29.320
is not necessarily the same as supporting the politician i don't think anyone should

03:29.320 --> 03:35.560
stand joe biden i'm not asking you to like comment and subscribe to joe biden's only fans

03:35.560 --> 03:41.960
fascinating though i'm sure it is the president has a big stick to me voting is more of a

03:41.960 --> 03:47.160
utilitarian calculation based on the likely consequences of each candidate

03:47.160 --> 03:47.300
winning or losing the election it's not just a vote for the president it's a vote for the president

03:47.300 --> 03:54.260
It's not hero worship, it's not choosing a person to have a beer with, it's strategy.

03:54.260 --> 03:55.360
Bad strategy?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.040
Biden is no better than Trump.

03:57.040 --> 04:01.740
The Dems are just Republicans with a ceremonial facade of meaningless liberal civility.

04:01.740 --> 04:07.340
Well, I agree that the Democrats are sucky libs, but it's simply not true that there's

04:07.340 --> 04:10.060
no difference between them and the Republicans.

04:10.060 --> 04:14.740
I remember leftists saying in 2016 that there was no real difference between Trump and Hillary,

04:14.740 --> 04:19.620
but there's a lot of things that Trump did that Hillary would not have done.

04:19.620 --> 04:23.500
Things like filling the Supreme Court with anti-abortion fanatics, withdrawing from the

04:23.500 --> 04:27.540
Paris Agreement, appointing climate change deniers to head climate research, attempting

04:27.540 --> 04:31.860
to remove medical non-discrimination protections for trans people, constantly maligning the

04:31.860 --> 04:36.020
integrity of elections with no evidence, declaring the press the enemy of the people, calling

04:36.020 --> 04:40.880
white nationalist militias very fine people and telling them to stand by, aspiring to

04:40.880 --> 04:44.620
be an autocratic dictator and disdaining democracy itself, trivializing

04:44.620 --> 04:44.720
a democracy that is not a democracy.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.060
And a deadly pandemic in the name of delusional macho posturing.

04:48.060 --> 04:52.540
So sure, the Democrats suck in their libs, but it does make a real difference if they're

04:52.540 --> 05:03.680
in control instead of the Republicans, especially if you're a woman or LGBTQ or a human who

05:03.680 --> 05:05.280
lives on the planet Earth.

05:05.280 --> 05:10.080
So Biden will give us rainbow capitalism and streets named after Black Lives Matter, but

05:10.080 --> 05:12.600
he'll do nothing to bring about systemic change.

05:12.600 --> 05:13.600
Well, Tabby Chan.

05:13.600 --> 05:14.600
I'm sorry to say.

05:14.600 --> 05:16.480
I agree with you about that.

05:16.480 --> 05:20.980
I fully expect to vote for Biden and then protest to the administration that I voted

05:20.980 --> 05:21.980
for.

05:21.980 --> 05:27.020
So you sit here vote-shaming me and in the next breath admitting it won't do anything?

05:27.020 --> 05:31.240
You're a counter-revolutionary lib with no plan except just vote.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.240
Tabby Chan.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.240
Tabby Chan.

05:33.240 --> 05:36.060
Look, I promise I'm not as dumb as I apparently look, comrade.

05:36.060 --> 05:39.240
Why is it that when you tell people on the left to vote, they think you're saying quit

05:39.240 --> 05:43.940
your job, abandon your family, retreat from society, and fall into a deep slumber from

05:43.940 --> 05:48.300
which you emerge once every four years to vote for a shitty lib before fleeing into

05:48.300 --> 05:52.700
the forest and reentering a ritual slumber on a stone slab in an eldritch temple awaiting

05:52.700 --> 05:55.380
the return of Baals above?

05:55.380 --> 05:56.700
Voting doesn't take that long.

05:56.700 --> 05:58.480
At most it takes one day.

05:58.480 --> 06:00.440
You can vote and do other things also.

06:00.440 --> 06:04.220
I guess you're probably still mad about that white woman with the we'd be at brunch

06:04.220 --> 06:05.220
sign.

06:05.220 --> 06:10.380
And I feel you, though, to be honest, I would eat a Louis 16th style armchair with a pair

06:10.380 --> 06:13.320
of chopsticks if it meant I got to go to brunch right now.

06:13.320 --> 06:15.680
Could you be any bougier?

06:15.680 --> 06:16.680
Don't call me bougie.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.680
I'm beyond bougie.

06:17.680 --> 06:21.920
When my carriage passes by the bourgeoisie, I scoff at them openly.

06:21.920 --> 06:27.380
I've had enough of this rad lib merchant class trying to abolish my fiefdom.

06:27.380 --> 06:31.220
You're a famous YouTuber whose class interests do not align with mine.

06:31.220 --> 06:32.920
Why should I listen to what you say?

06:32.920 --> 06:33.920
Oh, you shouldn't.

06:33.920 --> 06:36.160
I don't know why anyone listens to me, honestly.

06:36.160 --> 06:40.160
But also, I am a degenerate class traitor, and in my opinion, influencers should be the

06:40.160 --> 06:41.160
first against the wall.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.160
Honestly, I just wish you'd guillotine me quickly.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.160
I'm not a class traitor.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.160
I just want to get it over with.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.120
You at least have to admire that about us, libs.

06:47.120 --> 06:51.160
We have a remarkable willingness to have polite conversations with people who are trying

06:51.160 --> 06:52.160
to kill us.

06:52.160 --> 06:57.100
Speaking of which, we've been talking a lot about my plan, but what is your plan,

06:57.100 --> 06:58.100
Tabitha?

06:58.100 --> 06:59.100
Uh, protest?

06:59.100 --> 07:00.100
Unionize?

07:00.100 --> 07:01.100
Mutual aid?

07:01.100 --> 07:02.100
Strikes?

07:02.100 --> 07:03.100
So I totally agree.

07:03.100 --> 07:04.640
Those are all good things to do.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.960
I've gone to protests myself this year.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.160
I've given to a mutual aid group.

07:09.160 --> 07:12.160
You know, you're right that voting won't fix all our problems, and it's good to get

07:12.160 --> 07:13.160
involved in local things.

07:13.160 --> 07:16.600
But it still matters who's on the Supreme Court, right?

07:16.600 --> 07:19.320
And who's leading the national response to the coronavirus.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.160
So in addition to whatever else you're doing, vote.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.540
Why participate in the charade of a farcical election?

07:26.540 --> 07:27.540
America is not democratic.

07:27.540 --> 07:30.540
It's a rigged, two-party corporadocracy.

07:30.540 --> 07:35.860
Well, I mean, yeah, there is a lot wrong with our elections.

07:35.860 --> 07:41.160
Big money financing campaigns, the electoral college, gerrymandering, voter suppression,

07:41.160 --> 07:42.160
DC being disenfranchised.

07:42.160 --> 07:48.160
All of this should obviously be changed, but I don't think that in this moment, leftists

07:48.160 --> 07:51.400
boycotting the election is an effective form of protest.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.400
Okay, but voting is for liberal normies who use Facebook and Reddit.

07:55.400 --> 07:56.400
Ew.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.780
Okay, yeah, it's true that voting is not cool.

07:58.780 --> 07:59.780
It's boring.

07:59.780 --> 08:00.780
It's incrementalist.

08:00.780 --> 08:04.600
It doesn't make you feel like you're owning the libs or being edgier than your parents.

08:04.600 --> 08:09.400
But you know, you could always vote in secret and then maintain your radical image around

08:09.400 --> 08:10.400
your friends.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.400
Isn't being involved in politics inherently not cool?

08:11.400 --> 08:17.020
Because politics is for people who care, people who believe in things, people who

08:17.020 --> 08:21.560
place their hope in fallible human beings, all of which is very not cool.

08:21.560 --> 08:26.780
I feel like so much of internet politics, whether radical or centrist, is just posturing.

08:26.780 --> 08:31.520
It's showcasing that you're funnier and smarter than the normies, that you see through all

08:31.520 --> 08:37.020
the bullshit, the corrupt system, the electoral farce, but all you're doing about it is sitting

08:37.020 --> 08:41.360
here shitposting and demeaning the people who are actually trying to accomplish what

08:41.400 --> 08:42.400
little can be accomplished.

08:42.400 --> 08:48.480
And in effect, edgy leftists who complain about both sides and do nothing are no different

08:48.480 --> 08:51.560
from edgy centrists who complain about both sides and do nothing.

08:51.560 --> 08:56.540
Okay, but you yourself said Trump is an aspiring autocrat who doesn't believe in democracy.

08:56.540 --> 09:00.180
Why bother voting against someone who won't leave office even if he loses?

09:00.180 --> 09:02.780
This ends in violence either way, so we may as well smash.

09:02.780 --> 09:08.100
Well, you're right, I don't expect Trump to go quietly, but if there's a decisive Biden

09:08.100 --> 09:09.400
victory, and it's not some kind of vote recount nightmare, then I'm not going to vote against

09:09.400 --> 09:10.400
him.

09:11.400 --> 09:15.220
I think the military will force Trump to leave.

09:15.220 --> 09:19.760
Don't get me wrong, Tabby Chan, times are tough, the president is a fascist, I think

09:19.760 --> 09:24.000
this country is closer to some kind of violent uprising than it's ever been in my life.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.140
But if it comes to smashing, you're going to want allies.

09:27.140 --> 09:32.700
And for a lot of people, Trump rejecting a decisive Biden victory, therefore rejecting

09:32.700 --> 09:36.720
democracy itself, that would legitimize smashing.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.680
So you should still want every Biden vote you can get.

09:39.680 --> 09:40.480
But capitalism is the root of the problem.

09:41.400 --> 09:45.880
The whole system is broken and voting won't change that.

09:45.880 --> 09:50.120
We don't need a democrat, we need to end capitalism.

09:50.120 --> 09:56.080
Tabitha, capitalism is an epic world economic order.

09:56.080 --> 10:02.380
When you say end capitalism, you're talking about a tectonic shift in global politics

10:02.380 --> 10:07.140
that is so much bigger than all of us that I don't really understand what course of action

10:07.140 --> 10:08.140
you're recommending.

10:08.140 --> 10:09.280
Like, before capitalism, there was feudalism.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.280
And feudalism is a very big thing.

10:10.280 --> 10:11.280
It's a huge thing.

10:11.280 --> 10:17.680
And feudalism ended over hundreds of years of complex shifts in population and production.

10:17.680 --> 10:22.020
Not because people just decided it was time to end feudalism.

10:22.020 --> 10:27.460
So won't capitalism end just whenever a new economic system overtakes it?

10:27.460 --> 10:31.040
I don't think that's the kind of thing that can be accomplished by a small group of activists.

10:31.040 --> 10:35.760
And I say small group because, I'm sorry to break it to you, but the vast majority of

10:35.760 --> 10:37.440
Americans are not communists.

10:37.440 --> 10:39.960
I think a lot of internet leftists have a vastly overinflated society.

10:39.960 --> 10:40.960
And I'm not saying they're not communists.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.640
I'm just saying they have a very very overinflated sense of how big and important they are.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.920
I fell prey to it myself.

10:44.920 --> 10:48.820
Like, I was so sure that Bernie was going to win the primary.

10:48.820 --> 10:54.260
In part because, when I looked at my timeline, I was seeing this unanimous ocean of support

10:54.260 --> 10:56.720
for Bernie and contempt for the mainstream Dems.

10:56.720 --> 11:02.080
But what I was seeing, and what we're all seeing on our feeds, is a finely curated and

11:02.080 --> 11:05.040
very unrepresentative sample of the population.

11:05.040 --> 11:08.960
You have to remember that only 22% of Americans use Twitter at all.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.300
Most users rarely tweet.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.860
And 80% of tweets come from 10% of users.

11:13.860 --> 11:20.200
So 80% of tweets come from 2% of Americans, and it's not a representative 2%.

11:20.200 --> 11:24.420
According to Pew Research, Twitter users differ from the general population in that they're

11:24.420 --> 11:29.080
on average younger, more likely to identify as Democrats, more educated, and a higher

11:29.080 --> 11:30.080
income.

11:30.080 --> 11:35.660
And far-left, hammer-and-sickle Twitter is an even smaller, even more unrepresentative

11:35.660 --> 11:37.180
sample within a sample.

11:37.180 --> 11:40.140
We're talking about less than 0.1% of Americans.

11:40.300 --> 11:45.480
And that less than 0.1% does have an outsize influence, because they're prolific tweeters,

11:45.480 --> 11:49.100
and their tweets get seen by public figures who use the platform.

11:49.100 --> 11:53.480
Which is why there's so much discourse about cancel culture, even though cancel culture

11:53.480 --> 11:56.620
is produced by a relatively tiny group of people.

11:56.620 --> 12:01.680
So if you want to understand why even Democratic politicians cater to this retrograde soft

12:01.680 --> 12:05.460
conservatism, you have to pull your head out of the radical bubble.

12:05.460 --> 12:08.300
Back in 2012, I volunteered to work on the Obama campaign.

12:08.300 --> 12:09.300
And I invited a group of people to join me.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.300
And I invited a group of people to join me.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.300
And I invited a group of people to join me.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.300
And I invited a group of people to join me.

12:12.300 --> 12:13.300
After some resourceful engagement, I convinced them to commit to supporting the process.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.300
After some resourceful engagement, I convinced them to commit to supporting the process.

12:14.300 --> 12:20.580
And I really recommend that leftists try doing this for at least one election, even though

12:20.580 --> 12:23.300
it is the worst thing in the world and I hated it so much.

12:23.300 --> 12:25.300
You know, you do have to listen to a lot of

12:25.300 --> 12:30.200
I don't want Barack Hussein Obama redistributing my wealth.

12:30.200 --> 12:35.460
Okay Ronald, I'm pretty sure Obama is not sending his death panels out to your landscaping

12:35.460 --> 12:37.480
business but whatever.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.480
Talking to voters teaches you the hard realities of which your fellow Republicans are in a

12:39.480 --> 12:39.980
difficult position.

12:40.300 --> 12:45.820
Americans actually care about. And when I was canvassing, I did talk to some left-wing people,

12:45.960 --> 12:50.980
you know, I talked to union families, but I don't think I talked to a single communist. You know,

12:51.100 --> 12:56.580
most people do not read theory. Most people are concerned primarily with themselves and their

12:56.580 --> 13:00.960
families. They want personal security and prosperity. And if you look at the talking

13:00.960 --> 13:05.660
points used by politicians, they reflect that. That's why the right hammer is not about Antifa

13:05.660 --> 13:10.520
so much. Because it works. Most people are afraid for their personal property and safety.

13:11.080 --> 13:16.420
And this idea of Antifa looters and riots, it scares the shit out of people. Of course,

13:16.500 --> 13:23.400
in reality, Antifa is not scary. Like, I've met Antifa. And Antifa, you know, Antifa is Ryan.

13:24.100 --> 13:31.180
It's Ryan and his transgender, furry anarchist friends. But look, if what you want is socialism,

13:31.180 --> 13:35.600
or even just social democracy, then you have a lot of work ahead of you,

13:35.680 --> 13:41.600
in terms of outreach. You have to engage people, educate, raise awareness. But you don't want to

13:41.600 --> 13:46.420
do that, because it requires that you stop owning the libs and start actually communicating with

13:46.420 --> 13:52.560
them. You have to build alliances with, like, Facebook moms who ask ignorant questions, like,

13:52.960 --> 13:57.920
what's Indigenous People's Day? And who think that Kamala Harris making sassy faces is the

13:57.920 --> 14:02.320
height of praxis. And who probably watch ContraPoints, how embarrassing. You know,

14:02.360 --> 14:05.640
you can't let your radical queer friends catch you associating with mainstream,

14:05.660 --> 14:13.520
normie libs. How very bourgeois. But, revolution. Revolution to end capitalism.

14:14.580 --> 14:20.340
Okay, so you're saying that your plan is to do a communist revolution and overthrow the US

14:20.340 --> 14:31.220
government. That's very valid. That's super hecking valid. That's extremely valid. I mean,

14:31.220 --> 14:35.340
I guess I admire the ambition. Uh, just a couple quick follow-up questions, though.

14:35.660 --> 14:41.700
Are you counting on the US military and police taking the side of the communists, or is your plan to overpower them?

14:41.700 --> 14:45.260
Because unless you know something about the military that I don't, I don't think that

14:45.260 --> 14:51.380
much of the military is going to defect to join a communist revolution. So there will have to be a war.

14:51.380 --> 14:56.460
You know, revolution doesn't happen overnight. After the Russian Revolution, there is the Civil War from

14:56.460 --> 15:02.460
1917 to 1923. So you are going to need to raise a Red Army. I mean, you can't have a communist

15:02.460 --> 15:05.460
revolution without a Red Army, right? So how's that going for you?

15:05.460 --> 15:10.500
going, Tabitha? How many weapons have you amassed? How many units have you trained?

15:11.340 --> 15:15.480
Why are we talking about this? Why am I even entertaining this notion? You know,

15:15.500 --> 15:19.420
when the far right talks about violence and overthrowing the government, they actually mean

15:19.420 --> 15:23.760
it. And you know they mean it because they have literal militias, the three percenters,

15:24.000 --> 15:29.160
the boogaloo boys. They're stockpiling weapons and training to use them. They have ex-military

15:29.160 --> 15:33.620
men in their ranks and connections to white supremacists within the police and the military.

15:33.620 --> 15:40.780
Whereas when leftists talk about revolution on Twitter, it strikes me as ideation, not intent.

15:41.200 --> 15:46.180
You know, psychiatrists have this distinction between two kinds of suicidal thinking. So

15:46.180 --> 15:50.920
there's intent, which is when you have a plan for how you're going to do it, and then they have to

15:50.920 --> 15:55.680
commit you because you're a danger to yourself. And then there's ideation, which is, you know,

15:55.700 --> 16:00.220
you're not actually going to do it, but you just have that inner monologue that's constantly saying,

16:00.220 --> 16:03.500
I just want to die. There's no more joy.

16:03.620 --> 16:08.060
I'm going to be left in this world. I just can't stand it anymore. I just want to end it all.

16:08.660 --> 16:14.580
And then my psychiatrist says, well, we could try putting you back on Lexapro. And I say,

16:14.880 --> 16:22.200
not again, doctor. Not again. So right-wing extremist discourse is a violent intent,

16:22.620 --> 16:29.320
whereas left-wing radical discourse often amounts to revolutionary ideation. It's a kind of fantasy

16:29.800 --> 16:32.180
escapism, an alternative to politics.

16:33.620 --> 16:39.060
Plan a revolution. Revolution is the spontaneous reaction to intolerable injustice.

16:39.660 --> 16:44.540
Yeah, so a riot is the language of the unheard. But what kind of language is it?

16:44.900 --> 16:50.380
What is the point of speaking through a riot, or a protest, or a strike? Is it just emotional

16:50.380 --> 16:55.800
expression, like an angry diary entry? Or is the point not just to speak, but to be heard?

16:56.160 --> 17:01.460
Heard by whomst? Who are you trying to persuade? The glob glob glob glob? No, you want to be

17:01.460 --> 17:03.600
heard by the people with the power to change the world. You want to be heard by the people with the power to change the world.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.540
You want to be heard by the people with the power to change things. So it matters whether the people

17:05.540 --> 17:10.740
with power are likely to listen. This year, the U.S. has seen one of the biggest protest movements

17:10.740 --> 17:16.080
in history. And what has that accomplished? Well, at the moment, we have a president promising to

17:16.080 --> 17:21.160
double down on law and order, on military police suppression, a president who told a room full of

17:21.160 --> 17:26.520
cops not to be too gentle with the people they arrest. And when you see these thugs being thrown

17:26.520 --> 17:33.320
into the back of a paddy wagon, you just see them thrown in rough. I said, please don't be too nice.

17:33.600 --> 17:39.920
And let's be clear, both Biden and Copmala have an ugly record when it comes to crime and policing.

17:39.920 --> 17:44.400
For most of his career, Biden has called for more policing, which is the opposite of what we need

17:44.400 --> 17:49.200
right now. I'm right there with you, Tabby Chan. But the 2020 protests have shifted the discourse

17:49.200 --> 17:55.440
about policing and criminal justice. And Biden has responded by beginning to shift his position.

17:55.440 --> 17:59.520
This year's Democratic platform includes things like stricter use of force standards,

17:59.520 --> 18:02.720
banning chokeholds, restricting qualified immunity,

18:02.720 --> 18:08.320
creating a registry of police misconduct, limiting no-knock warrants, decriminalizing weed,

18:08.320 --> 18:12.240
investing in crime prevention and social work. And is that good enough?

18:12.240 --> 18:17.360
No, it's not good enough. But it's a start. It's progress. It shows that the Democrats are

18:17.360 --> 18:22.640
at least willing to listen to protests. When John F. Kennedy first took office in 1961,

18:22.640 --> 18:26.400
he didn't want to propose a civil rights bill because that would have been super unpopular

18:26.400 --> 18:31.920
with the Southern Democrats. But then 1963 happened, and there were protests and uprisings

18:32.720 --> 18:36.720
in Washington, D.C., and the March on Washington that summer. And Kennedy listened.

18:36.720 --> 18:43.040
The events in Birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality

18:43.040 --> 18:48.720
that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them.

18:48.720 --> 18:54.000
He was moved by the protests, and he responded by introducing what became the

18:54.000 --> 18:59.200
Civil Rights Act of 1964. But what if Kennedy hadn't been president in 1963?

18:59.200 --> 19:02.640
What if some fascist had been president? What if Trump had been president?

19:03.120 --> 19:09.200
We might not have gotten a Civil Rights Act. So it does matter who's president. It actually

19:09.200 --> 19:16.720
matters a lot. And please, Tabby Chun, do not let a fascist win to own the libs. God damn it.

19:16.720 --> 19:22.720
All right, fam, let's open a new tab. Go to vote.gov and enter your state.

19:22.720 --> 19:27.040
And yeah, I know this is boring, but I'm trying to think about the tantrum Trump

19:27.040 --> 19:32.080
is going to throw when an entire nation rejects him, and I'm letting that motivate me.

19:32.720 --> 19:38.000
Some states you can still register, so register now if you still haven't. If you're voting in

19:38.000 --> 19:44.800
person, go to vote.org and find your polling place and make a plan for how you're going to get there.

19:44.800 --> 19:51.200
Make sure your phone's charged, and you might want to bring some snacks or even some friends.

19:51.200 --> 19:56.960
If you're like me, you need to set an alarm so you don't forget, and then just try not to get

19:56.960 --> 20:02.000
inconsolably high until after you've placed your vote. Because we've all been living through a year

20:02.720 --> 20:08.960
of financial crisis. And I, for one, think that we all deserve to begin 2021 by collectively

20:08.960 --> 20:15.600
purging from our lives this swindling, pestilent doofus. Vote him out.

20:32.720 --> 21:02.700
Judgment and justice will be done in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, and of the Holy Spirit, and of the Holy Spirit.

21:02.720 --> 21:32.700
For I know that I have made poor to you, and to the poor, and to the lowly, and to the lowly.

21:32.720 --> 22:02.700
For I know that I have made poor to you, and to the lowly, and to the lowly.

22:02.720 --> 22:32.700
For I know that I have made poor to you, and to the lowly, and to the lowly.

22:32.720 --> 23:02.700
For I know that I have made poor to you, and to the lowly, and to the lowly.

23:02.720 --> 23:14.720
The earth is now album of the knowledge that no truth sets the water before the sea.

23:14.720 --> 23:32.720
For I know the thoughts that I think are the increase of his government, and these filled me to evidence that were the thrones of David and Gabriel's kingdom,

23:32.720 --> 23:39.560
I want to establish the judgment and justice for the time.
