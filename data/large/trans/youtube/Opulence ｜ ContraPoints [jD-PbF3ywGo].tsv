0	29380	Oh, hey, Quaritch.
30000	31200	Hey, how are you, Quaritch?
31420	34040	Okay, listen, I know this looks bad.
34340	37140	I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine.
37260	38860	Well, fair enough.
39040	42080	But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?
42580	43260	How about this?
43560	46360	I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off,
46460	49020	but first you have to let me tell you my life story.
49300	51240	Fair? That's super fucking great.
51440	53640	Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.
53920	54940	I'll start at the beginning.
55720	58660	My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.
58660	61240	I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C.,
61240	63260	where the most exciting attraction for children
63260	65440	is the National Museum of Natural History.
65760	68500	At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children who,
68780	72760	might I add, deserve their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.
73140	76140	Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong,
76420	79180	I liked a good Stegosaurus as much as the next five-year-old,
79420	82440	but my real passion was the gem and mineral hall.
82840	84780	Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.
85020	87280	It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.
87280	91500	I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.
91920	94940	The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up
94940	98460	for my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.
98820	101840	Fuck you, Romano. I'm glad your father died.
102240	104200	Comrades, losers, and haters,
104660	107580	I would like to propose that aesthetic sensibility,
108100	111100	whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion, or music,
111600	113280	begins with absolute pleasure.
113840	116340	You rotate the crystal in your hand,
116340	118900	and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.
119280	120720	Your nape hair stands on end,
120880	122720	and a tingle goes down your spine.
122860	124000	Yes, God!
124180	127160	But as you get older, things get more complicated.
127760	129980	Northern Virginia is McMansion country,
130260	132960	and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,
133280	135480	I remember riding around in the back of the minivan,
135760	138400	looking at some stylistically jumbled monstrosities,
138620	140720	and I would get excited by some little detail,
140720	145320	like, say, a circle of fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.
145500	146320	But then my mom would say,
146560	149160	Look at this ostentatious trash!
149400	150200	So you learn.
150200	153700	You learn taste, according to the social class of your upbringing.
153700	156860	And with taste comes all this adult baggage,
156860	159860	snobbery, and pretense and conceit.
159860	162140	So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers,
162140	165300	but I assure you, I have nothing to do with taste.
165300	169780	I am but a simple queen, longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.
169780	174200	So, stripey sock cat girls of the heckin' revolutionary committee,
174200	175780	before you pass sentence,
176340	178340	allow me to make my case, Gorge.
197440	199440	One, success.
201060	202800	Oh, hey, how are you, Gorge?
202800	204240	Look, I like stuff.
204240	206240	I like shiny things.
206340	210200	For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.
210200	214820	But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.
214820	217120	There's a social context for it.
217120	219420	It generally means something.
219420	223640	Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace married a Turkmenistani dictator
223640	225560	and moved into a cheesecake factory?
225560	228080	Well, because he's trying to send a message.
228080	229500	Maybe to the world.
229500	230500	Maybe to himself.
230500	231500	He's saying,
231500	232500	Behold!
232500	233500	I am a winner.
233500	234560	A very stable genius, with one of the highest.
234560	235060	I am a winner.
235060	235560	I am a winner.
235560	237560	One of the highest IQs.
237560	240800	Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power.
240800	243260	From the pharaohs of Egypt, to the kings of France,
243260	246320	to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.
246320	248560	I guess God likes shiny things, too.
248560	253400	In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.
253400	258040	It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American dream.
258040	262040	The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.
262040	263040	In the words of Drake,
263040	264040	Started from the bottom, now we're here.
264040	265040	We're here.
265040	265540	We're here.
265560	269880	Started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.
269880	273400	Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.
273400	274400	You've made it.
274400	275400	You're rich, bitch.
275400	279940	Remember in high school when you had to read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?
279940	284060	The character Jay Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties, but he throws them
284060	289040	anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it, that he's a success, that he's
289040	290040	worth something.
290040	294380	And as we all remember, in the end, they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to
294380	295380	save the Hall of Hrothgar.
295560	299900	At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay about how the theme of
299900	304100	The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.
304100	305100	I got a D-.
305100	310800	I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like money, I like shining, I like those Balenciagas.
310800	311800	Fuck.
311800	315800	I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms and driving lambs and all
315800	318800	that shit, but teacher, pick me, pick me.
318800	323180	Let's talk about symbols, let's talk about allegory, let's talk about metaphor, let's
323180	324180	talk about themes.
324180	325400	Fellow students, I'm sorry.
325400	329580	Let us place the text in historical context.
329580	334040	Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper to making money moves.
334040	336640	That's the American Dream.
336640	341940	Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism, it's a celebration of success
341940	345780	for people who often come from backgrounds where that kind of success is really improbable.
345780	351440	Don't you think it's kinda weird that conservatives still say, rap music is the reason for the
351440	353640	problems with the blacks?
353640	354760	For conservatives, the American Dream.
354760	358240	The American Dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.
358240	363100	And is there any sector of our culture where the American Dream is more unironically celebrated
363100	364100	than hip-hop?
364100	365920	It's not just hip-hop, though.
365920	369160	Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.
369160	373380	You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci and the Ferraris and the Fendi
373380	375800	and the Bugattis and the Armani and the Maseratis.
375800	381500	Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit, which,
381500	384560	to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.
384560	388540	Turn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care, and replace it with a large-scale
388540	391440	figure of Donatella Versace holding a bottle of Cristal.
391440	395560	That's at least a more honest representation of our culture than the hypocritical cheese
395560	397800	verse currently inscribed on Liberty Island.
397800	400320	I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?
400320	403140	Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.
403140	404700	We have standards in this country.
404700	406340	Listen up, America.
406340	407620	We live in a society.
407620	411240	A society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
411240	413880	Not of climbers, but of...
413880	414400	Graspers.
414560	421160	To paraphrase Iain Danskin, maybe anyone can achieve the American dream, but everyone
421160	422160	cannot.
422160	425520	And the fact of the matter is, most people don't.
425520	429600	I mean, what would it even mean to be rich unless someone else was poor?
429600	432440	I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?
432440	434340	Not all the rich people, that's for sure.
434340	439060	So when you live in a society that constantly equates wealth and success, but which is also
439060	444120	so unequal that most people will never be wealthy, well...
444120	451720	What's the average person supposed to do?
451720	452720	Two.
452720	453720	Fantasy.
453720	454720	Sigh.
454720	455720	I wish the world were my gem collection.
455720	456720	I wish I owned everything.
456720	457720	I'm really just the worst kind of philistine, you know?
457720	463720	I go to an art museum and it's like, Monet, Rembrandt, okay, that's super fucking great,
463720	465120	but can I buy it?
465120	466120	Well, no.
466120	467120	I can't buy it.
467120	469720	The grim reality is, you can't own everything.
469720	471720	So what do you do?
471720	472720	Well...
472720	473720	You fake it.
473720	475720	You create an illusion.
475720	477720	I don't own this building.
477720	482320	And you boob off the streets of Baltimore and walk in here, as indeed you did.
482320	483320	But that's okay.
483320	484320	I need a witness.
484320	487320	I need you to see me here, among the other art.
487320	490320	Where I belong.
490320	493320	Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?
493320	495320	Makes me feel valuable.
495320	501320	You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent, because opulence is not abundance.
501320	503320	Opulence is the aesthetic.
503720	504720	Of abundance.
504720	508720	It is the aesthetic of owning everything.
508720	514720	The phrase opulence, you own everything is at this point basically a gay internet meme.
517720	521920	But it originally comes from the documentary Paris Is Burning, about the Harlem ballroom
521920	525720	culture in the 1980s, where it's proclaimed by MC Junior LaBeija.
525720	530720	O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E.
530720	531720	Opulence.
531720	532720	You own everything.
532720	534880	You own everything!
534880	538480	It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle of luxury and decadence.
538480	543440	In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says of the queer Black and Latin American participants of the Bulls,
543440	546400	You know, a lot of those kids that are in the Bulls, they don't have two of nothing.
547520	549120	Some of them don't even eat.
549120	552560	So, ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamour,
552560	555120	an illusion created by skillful artifice.
555120	558080	Participants walk categories like executive realness,
558080	561360	with the goal of being indistinguishable from a real executive.
561360	563920	Nowadays, every white queer says the word realness.
563920	565760	I guess in kind of a frivolous way.
565760	570720	I mean, Whomst Among Us honestly hasn't slipped into a dissociative fugue state,
570720	574160	dressed up as a clown, kidnapped a few neighborhood children,
574160	578000	and told the cops, I'm giving you John Wayne Gacy realness, hunty.
578000	579520	I did it, officer.
579520	581520	I did the cultural appropriation.
581520	582960	I am a colonizer.
582960	584560	I am part of the problem.
584560	585600	And I'm sorry.
585600	586960	Take me away, boys.
586960	587920	That's crazy.
587920	589520	That's mega coconuts.
589520	590800	I guess I should explain that
590800	595760	American slang works according to what we might call a trickle-up model of linguistics.
595760	599600	All the new words are invented by the most marginalized gay and trans people of color.
599600	603120	Then those words trickle up to straight black people and white gays,
603120	605600	and then finally white cishets start using them.
605600	609200	A lot of times the original meaning or context gets lost along the way.
609200	612320	So originally, realness, as Sean Faye put it,
612320	615840	was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume,
615840	620320	but a tragicomic disguise of the chasm between what is being emulated
620320	625200	and what is absent, namely racial justice, class equality, and safety.
625200	629680	Realness, in that sense, is a much more complicated and interesting concept
629680	632320	than the generic trans notion of passing.
632320	635760	Passing is just looking like a 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio girl.
635760	640080	Whereas in the ballroom sense, realness has a subtext of defying injustice.
640080	643360	You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle
643360	645760	that has been unjustly kept beyond your reach.
645760	649680	You're not really an executive, but you're looking like an executive.
649680	650160	And therefore, you're not just an executive.
650160	653200	You're showing the straight world that I can be an executive.
653200	655360	If I had the opportunity, I could be one.
655360	656960	Because I can look like one.
656960	660800	I think one reason there's been a surge of interest in 80s ballroom culture,
660800	663920	such as the FX drama Pose, which is set during the era,
663920	667200	is that it dramatizes an essential truth about America.
667200	670640	It's really important to people in this country to at least sometimes feel
670640	674160	like they're living a luxe life, even if in fact, they aren't.
674160	677920	Las Vegas is essentially an entire city that exploits that need.
677920	679520	Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio, and the San Francisco,
679520	684160	are designed to make you feel like a fancy bitch,
684160	686320	even though they're actually just high-rise traps,
686320	688080	designed to lure you in and take your money.
688080	689920	And if there's one thing I can't stand,
693360	694720	it's traps.
698720	701760	But the trap works, because part of what it is to be American
701760	704000	is to want to feel like a fancy bitch.
704000	705280	I actually love Vegas.
705280	707680	I was there last year for the only good YouTuber,
707680	709440	Lindsay Ellis's bachelorette party.
709520	712400	I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.
712400	715120	But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-forties,
715120	719120	I did once experience the first exciting stages of a gambling habit.
719120	721920	I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity,
721920	724080	and had some good luck playing blackjack.
724080	726080	I mean, I wasn't a high-roller or anything,
726080	728800	but my first time I walked out with an extra $200.
729440	731040	And that was a lot of money to me.
731040	734880	At the time, I was working a customer service job making $10 an hour,
734880	739360	so to make $200 in five minutes, that's worth 20 hours.
739360	742000	It's a soul-crushing customer service toil.
742560	744000	Before taxes.
744000	747760	So I went back and I went back, but I never got lucky again.
747760	750640	And fortunately, that was enough to discourage me.
750640	753120	I remember one time as I was leaving the casino,
753120	756480	I saw this man standing outside with this look on his face
756480	759760	that I have never seen on a human being before or since.
759760	765840	Just absolute shock, despair, this deep shame and self-disgust.
765840	767280	The kind of face that says,
767280	769120	I'm gonna have to explain to my wife
769120	772640	that I spent the kids' college savings on a high-limit slot machine.
772640	775200	And there is nothing opulent about that,
775200	778480	nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs with IV drips
778480	780720	trying to pay off their hospital bills.
780720	784720	America, we are a bad country.
784720	786320	Donald Trump is a Vegas man.
786320	788640	He's pulling this grift on the entire country.
788640	792960	And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence of the American dream
792960	795360	is more enchanting to the imagination
795360	798800	than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.
798800	802160	So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell,
802160	805760	but in fact, there are two very different types of magic at work.
805760	808720	For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex,
808720	810800	a demonstration of their wealth and power.
810800	813120	But for the marginalized and impoverished,
813120	817040	opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and power they've been denied.
817040	820480	The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function,
820480	825120	it's like the difference between a viper and a butterfly serving viper realness.
825840	827520	3. Class
828800	829840	Hey, how are you?
829840	831120	Hey, how are you?
831120	832320	Hey, how are you?
833280	834080	Hey, how are you?
834800	837760	People don't understand how difficult it is to be this blonde.
837760	840400	You know, a biological female that looks like me,
840400	844480	I'm afraid some transvestite psycho is gonna sneak in through a rear window
844480	846400	and I'll have to dial M for murder.
846400	848160	I get vertigo just thinking about it.
848160	852400	I've always found the Marxist analysis of class difficult to apply to the present day.
852400	856160	As a typical modern woman, it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to.
856160	858000	I haven't been hope, and I hope, and I hope, and I hope?
858000	859440	That's praxis.
859440	862080	Like bourgeoisie and proletariat?
862080	862800	Hoompst.
862800	863680	Who is she?
863680	865280	Where's her summer collection?
865280	867600	That's super fucking great, but can't I buy it?
867600	871520	Marx's typical examples are a factory owner and a factory worker.
871520	874320	Now, I could be am Shocker but personally,
874320	878080	I've never met a factory worker, or a factory owner for that matter.
878080	882160	They all must be on a brand trip to China work on the enfm's summer collection.
882160	884640	What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles,
884640	885760	is that the bougies own them out of proportion.
885760	886000	Just give them a sound interessante kick and I'm using all that subactus.
886000	890480	the means of production and the proles work for wages. But what about a bartender who owns the
890480	895760	bar she works in? What about YouTubers? Which side of the revolution are we on? I'm just trying to
895760	900080	figure out where I stand here. Because if the revolution starts on Twitter, my head is definitely
900080	904240	going in the basket. And then I'll have no choice but to do the conservative talk show circuit.
904240	908080	You know, like most people whose brains are detached from their bodies.
908080	910800	Maria Antoinette did nothing wrong, eh, are you?
910800	915040	I feel like a class analysis with only two classes must be overly simplistic.
915040	918560	My favorite book about class in America is Paul Fussell's Class,
918560	923120	A Guide Through the American Status System, which describes nine distinct classes.
923120	928080	Fussell is not as concerned with economic relations between classes as he is with status,
928080	931200	what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.
931200	935360	Things like education, style, taste, and attitude towards money.
935360	940080	Now the book was published in 1983, so a lot of the references and details are out of date,
940080	943680	but there's an eerie familiarity to a lot of the core observations.
943680	944960	And it's also just pretty funny.
945040	948800	Like his quasi-scientific observation that the higher your social class,
948800	953200	the smaller the balls in the sports you play. Or his description of middle class living rooms.
953200	958800	Your real middle class refuses to show any but the most bland books and magazines
958800	964960	on its coffee tables. Otherwise, expressions of opinion, awkward questions, or even ideas
964960	965600	might result.
965600	970320	One of Fussell's core themes is that it's not how much money you have that defines your class,
970320	974800	so much as how you got your money. If you had to work for your money, then you're not
974800	980720	really upper class. The upper class has inherited wealth, and as a result they're very confident.
980720	983360	They don't feel the need to prove themselves.
983360	987840	Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted their position on the ladder.
987840	992080	But then there's the middle class, who are social climbers, and who compensate for their
992080	997360	insecurities by, for example, placing a pretentious collage of university bumper
997360	1001760	stickers on the back of the family car. This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.
1001760	1004640	The higher and lower classes, there's some good in them, but, uh,
1004800	1009840	the middle classes are all affectation and conceit and pretense and concealment.
1009840	1015360	Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated by people with something to prove,
1015360	1019360	whether it's marginalised ballroom performers proving their worth to themselves,
1019360	1022960	or the new rich building McMansions to show off their wealth to others.
1022960	1027280	So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump. He inherited his wealth, so
1027280	1033280	he should know better than to have golden faucets. But he doesn't. As Fran Lebowitz said,
1033280	1034640	he's a poor person's identity.
1034640	1040080	He's a rich person's identity. And that's actually his charm. It's part of his mass appeal.
1040080	1045040	Trump behaves like a prole who won the lottery. So there's actually something kind of relatable,
1045040	1050080	unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic about the golden faucets. People who have wealth,
1050080	1054400	but not class, are actually very popular in this country.
1054400	1058720	We don't like class here, because class is exclusionary.
1058720	1064560	Whereas anyone can acquire wealth, we tell ourselves, so wealth feels potentially inclusive
1064560	1067600	of everyone, even though in practice, it isn't.
1067600	1071600	Now, the upper-class cultural elite in this country, the real classy people,
1071600	1076080	are mostly very unlike Trump. Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy,
1076080	1082240	they embrace the reserved old-money values of aristocratic wasps, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.
1082240	1086640	Fussell notes, for instance, that they tend to value privacy over showing off.
1086640	1090560	They like to live at the end of long driveways and houses away from public view.
1090560	1094320	They dress down while travelling so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.
1094560	1098000	These are essentially survival skills of the experienced rich.
1098000	1101120	If you flaunt your wealth too much, people might rob you,
1101120	1105280	or they might get envious and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.
1105280	1107120	Or worse, taxation.
1108240	1113600	Old money knows this, but new money just cannot resist the temptation to show off.
1113600	1116640	I actually wonder if the old waspy upper-class is dying out.
1116640	1120480	I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory of money over class.
1120480	1124480	His presidency validates the idea that you can be as vulgar as you want,
1124560	1126960	so long as you have the cash to back it up.
1126960	1130320	So the old-class system is dying out, and in its place,
1130320	1133680	we have universally adopted the mindset of the nouveau riche.
1133680	1135840	If you got it, flaunt it.
1135840	1138960	If you haven't got it, find a way to flaunt it anyway.
1138960	1143200	Now, I'm sure this is all very tragic and disappointing to people of class and taste,
1143200	1148960	but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur, it's actually fantastic news.
1150560	1152240	4. Taste
1152240	1152320	4. Taste
1152320	1154000	4. Taste
1154000	1158240	Listen comrades, I've been pretty down on opulence so far,
1158240	1161840	and I could continue analyzing it in terms of inequality and class struggle,
1161840	1163760	but you already know all that.
1164320	1166080	That's why you came to cut my head off.
1166640	1170160	But hold on, is that really all there is to aesthetics?
1170160	1172080	Marxist economic analysis?
1172080	1175600	Or the SJW version that makes everything about race and gender?
1175600	1179200	As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,
1179200	1182400	But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary,
1182400	1184000	to simultaneously enjoy music,
1184000	1184560	media,
1184560	1188480	while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.
1188480	1190480	So what about the enjoyment part?
1190480	1193360	Surely you wouldn't be ahead of Queen just for liking shiny thing.
1193360	1195680	Is there no room for art for art's sake?
1195680	1198560	The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen,
1198560	1202080	Fräulein Emanuel Hildegard Marlene Kennedy Davenport Kant,
1202080	1204800	said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested,
1204800	1207600	that is, completely free of any material desire.
1207600	1210720	Of course, Miss Thing also founded the hashtag nofap movement,
1210720	1213120	so I don't know how seriously we want to take that.
1213120	1213840	But it's actually true.
1213840	1216880	It's actually kind of similar to what Plato said about aesthetic sense,
1216880	1220240	that it merely begins with a desire for the bodies of beautiful boys,
1220240	1224160	which is really just a shadow of our true longing for the concept of beauty itself.
1224160	1228400	God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy is just a bunch of repressed homos
1228400	1230960	trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.
1230960	1232240	What must that be like?
1232240	1234640	From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart,
1234640	1238320	that must be super fucking hard for them, I can't even imagine.
1238320	1239920	I mean, it makes sense, really.
1239920	1241760	Straight men don't have these problems.
1241760	1243680	They got away with painting softcore for 500 years.
1243680	1245120	They never had to think about it.
1245120	1246640	I guess Nietzsche is the exception.
1246640	1251680	He was straight and a philosopher, but he was an incel and, let's be honest,
1251680	1253120	definitely a chaser.
1253120	1256240	The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history is the
1256800	1259360	respectable English gentleman, Oscar Wilde.
1259360	1260560	According to Wilde,
1260560	1266240	Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.
1266240	1267520	This is a fault.
1267520	1272160	Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.
1272160	1273520	For these, there is hope.
1273520	1278400	They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.
1278400	1280240	Spoken like a poet.
1280240	1281840	You want to be cultivated, don't you?
1282480	1283920	Don't you think I'm beautiful?
1283920	1285360	Look, I'll play it your way.
1285360	1288320	Let's swing back to the other side of the Sarkeesian pendulum here.
1290880	1295040	As sentimental as I personally am about art for art's sake and all of that,
1295040	1297600	but from a strictly sociological perspective,
1297600	1302000	I have to admit, taste is pretty intimately related to power.
1302000	1303040	When you go to a museum,
1303040	1307840	you look at various objects on pedestals under special lighting that makes them appear magical.
1307840	1310160	Now, that's also what you do in Bed Bath & Beyond,
1310160	1313840	but the difference is that at the museum, you can't buy anything.
1313840	1316800	And that turns out to be important for Kantian reasons.
1316800	1319680	In the retail context of commodity fetishism,
1319680	1323200	you correlate your aesthetic taste with material desire.
1323200	1327040	Whereas in the museum, because you can't buy anything,
1327040	1329680	you feel like your aesthetic pleasure is pure,
1329680	1332880	that you're simply enjoying out of context objects.
1333040	1334720	But of course, that's an illusion.
1334720	1336640	The museum is the context,
1336640	1340640	and the context is telling you that the things you're looking at are art.
1340640	1342960	So whoever decides what's in the museum,
1342960	1344960	decides what good taste is,
1344960	1346080	what's beautiful,
1346080	1347040	what's valuable.
1347040	1350320	Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.
1350320	1353760	Beyonce and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre,
1353760	1358320	conferring upon themselves the status and the cultural grandeur of the art.
1358320	1359840	But it's not just a flex.
1359840	1361680	It means something more than that
1361680	1362880	because of the racial disparity.
1362880	1368000	Black people and black art are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre.
1368000	1370800	So seeing Jay and Bey there looking so regal,
1370800	1374480	with black dancers even overshadowing canonical European art,
1374480	1376320	it's like a full moment.
1376320	1382400	A lot of people have a deep longing for the sense of dignity and grandeur conferred by classical art.
1382400	1388000	That's why trans women love that picture someone photoshopped of the three graces, but with dicks.
1388000	1391520	I'll admit that silly picture actually had an emotional effect on me.
1391520	1400800	Because here in The West, it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful until you've seen it sculpted in white marble.
1400800	1405280	Oh, speaking of which, white marble is a lie.
1405280	1414880	For most of art history history, scholars have insisted that the iconic ghostly whiteness of classical statues was a distinguishing feature of western sculpture,
1414880	1418640	proof of the elegant taste of the ancient Greeks and Romans.
1418640	1421520	In reality, of course, it turns out they were painted the color white,
1421520	1424180	of something a drag queen might wear to a quinceanera.
1424180	1427060	Scholars had been noticing paint remnants on these statues
1427060	1430260	for hundreds of years, but were totally in denial about it
1430260	1432360	because the pure whiteness of these figures
1432360	1433920	was like a sacred dogma.
1433920	1435620	Margaret Talbot in the New Yorker
1435620	1437880	attributes the dogma in part to
1437880	1440200	a tendency to equate whiteness
1440200	1443360	with beauty, taste, and classical ideals,
1443360	1447560	and to see color as alien, sensual, and garish.
1447560	1451760	In 2008, Fabio Berri, an art historian
1451760	1454160	who is now at Stanford, complained that
1454160	1456780	a boldly colored recreation of a statue
1456780	1459920	of the Emperor Augustus at the Vatican Museum
1459920	1463080	looked like a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.
1464440	1465540	Hey, how are you?
1465540	1468360	And you just know that when the news first broke,
1468360	1471320	some horrified WASP classicist turned to a colleague
1471320	1476320	and said, oh, Kingsley, it looks, it looks Mexican.
1477560	1481200	In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues,
1481200	1484480	some art historians have been harassed by the alt-right,
1484480	1486680	who don't take kindly to anyone questioning
1486680	1489180	their white supremacist myths about antiquity.
1489180	1491300	There's some pretty insidious, uh,
1491300	1493620	identitarian prejudices here
1493620	1496100	hiding out under the cloak of taste.
1496100	1499040	Good taste for upper and middle class white people
1499040	1501540	generally includes a reflexive disdain
1501540	1505540	for anything a little bit too colorful.
1505540	1506560	It's these classes that constantly use, you know,
1506560	1507520	the word, white supremacy, and white supremacy,
1507520	1511800	they use the words gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.
1511800	1513840	Joe Weldon, author of Fierce,
1513840	1516580	The History of Leopard Print, observes that
1516580	1520180	tacky as a concept refers to the lack of cultivation
1520180	1521880	or the resistance to taste,
1521880	1524340	and more often than not refers to tastes
1524340	1526340	that are not suitably conservative.
1526340	1529700	Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine, ethnic,
1529700	1533220	queer, deviant, not manly, not practical,
1533220	1536040	not business-like, not serious.
1536040	1537520	Aesthetic excess.
1537520	1540720	Particularly of colors, patterns, and bling
1540720	1544520	is especially offensive to conservative wasp taste.
1544520	1547440	Tacky is often where the imagination runs free,
1547440	1551320	where the heart is, where the soul is, and where the fun is.
1551320	1552460	Well, that's good news,
1552460	1554940	because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.
1554940	1556320	I can't imagine why.
1556320	1558180	Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.
1558180	1559320	Or camp.
1559320	1560680	People call me camp,
1560680	1563600	and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.
1563600	1566140	I suppose it depends on what camp means.
1566140	1567440	Camp was the theme of this year's
1567440	1569780	Met Gala, and my feed was flooded
1569780	1572800	with Brooklynite intellectuals competing to outwit each other
1572800	1576100	with the most erudite definition of what camp really is.
1576100	1579240	What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.
1579240	1581080	The first I'll call coward camp,
1581080	1584860	this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.
1584860	1587520	I have no respect for this whatsoever.
1587520	1589280	This is nothing but an anxious
1589280	1591840	and defensive refusal to take a risk.
1591840	1593680	You think you're safe from criticism
1593680	1595840	because your look is bad on purpose.
1595840	1596840	Fuck that.
1596840	1598900	Don't take a stand, you pussy bitch.
1598900	1602880	I take great offense to this as a person whose look is bad on accident,
1602880	1604960	and Susan Sontag agrees with me.
1604960	1607200	In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between
1607200	1609660	naive and deliberate camp.
1609660	1612620	Pure camp is always naive.
1612620	1617160	Camp which knows itself to be camp or camping is usually less satisfying.
1617160	1620600	Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness,
1620600	1624080	a grand artistic vision that gets a little out of control
1624080	1626000	and enters into absurd territory.
1626840	1627840	Hey, how are you?
1627840	1628840	I don't know.
1628840	1632520	My philosophy of style is that people should wear what looks good to them.
1632520	1635680	I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.
1635680	1637820	I think my aesthetic is good.
1637820	1641960	This is what looks good to me, though I'm aware other people might judge it.
1641960	1647020	I like what John Waters said about there being good bad taste and bad bad taste.
1647020	1652620	One must remember, there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.
1652620	1656000	To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.
1656000	1656720	I've wondered.
1656720	1661320	I've wondered for a long time why I'm so attracted to bad taste.
1661320	1664960	Like, I technically have the education to know better.
1664960	1669020	I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.
1669020	1670680	Why am I so tacky?
1670680	1675660	I think it's because I'm a transsexual, which lowers you at least a class.
1675660	1680180	If you were born upper class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now, bitch.
1680180	1684480	If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.
1684480	1685480	And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now, bitch.
1685480	1686480	If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.
1686480	1687480	And if you were born sexual-
1687480	1689460	Oh, sweaty.
1689460	1691500	You'd better start a revolution.
1691500	1692500	Marsha P. Johnson?
1692500	1693500	Hey, how're you?

1700200	1702740	Trans women have a special relationship with glamour.
1702740	1704820	At least, those of us who came of age in the 1960s.
1704820	1709540	At least the most basic everyday sense, GLAM is a way of styling yourself.
1709540	1711420	It is luxuriant hair.
1711420	1713000	It's high drama makeup.
1713000	1714260	It's long nails.
1714260	1715140	It's glitter everywhere.
1715140	1716200	It's posing like a fellow human.
1716200	1721000	a fashion model but originally the word glamour comes from the scottish word grammary meaning
1721000	1728040	magic or enchantment and glamour still involves a kind of illusion or charm cast on a spectator
1728040	1733800	the connection between glamour and opulence is explored in the 2004 essay viva mcglam is
1733800	1739400	transgenderism a critique of or capitulation to opulence-driven glamour models by transgender
1739400	1745800	writer and underground house music producer terry temlitz aka dj sprinkles sprinkles writes
1745800	1751400	europe's ruling elite used opulence as an ideological weapon to befuddle the lower classes
1751400	1757080	with glimpses of heaven on earth a lifestyle so foreign and unattainable that it could only be the
1757080	1763160	result of divination it is this spell of opulence that led to our current definition of glamour
1763160	1769560	which is more associated with wealth than magic sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour
1769560	1775480	or grammar that was associated with witchcraft paganism and sexual deviancy but in our capitalist
1775800	1782200	society glamour is a spell of opulence conjuring up what is often a fantasy of a lavish life
1782200	1787400	for example a lot of drag queens practice this sort of illusionism by impersonating celebrities
1787400	1792840	thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses pop stars and models second hand sprinkles is bothered
1792840	1797800	by the way this sort of second-hand glamour acquires its power from unquestioned social
1797800	1804920	hierarchies glamour is suspect as a critical-minded political forum because it is about social distance
1805800	1811160	integration the promise of the pop glam diva is not the promise of social transformation
1811160	1817560	but individual transformation in which the exploited becomes the exploiter it is the promise
1817560	1825240	of an individual's class mobility not social betterment or class critique it is by and large
1825240	1831160	the american dream now i have to admit this is a version of the american dream that hits pretty
1831160	1835560	close to home for me the overarching plot line of my whole entire youtube gender journey
1835800	1840440	is that i used to be a tragic mess and i'm still a tragic mess but when i started this
1840440	1845240	channel i was a broke gender dysphoric alcoholic cross-dressing tragic mess
1845240	1849800	i'd play a clip but honestly those videos are still too painful for me to even glance at
1849800	1854600	and now i mean look at me look how far i've come i look like a moderately talented female
1854600	1860200	impersonator hey how are you those first several months of transition though they were rough i had
1860200	1865640	a lot of trouble in the beginning i used to get laughed out of restaurants and i was so proud that
1865800	1871320	i wouldn't let anyone see how much that stuff hurt me you know i would say well them i know i'm
1871320	1878280	great and then i'd go cry my eyes out alone in my car and i was a youtuber that whole time too which
1879400	1884760	i mean the cyber bullying alone i don't think you can even imagine the extent of it if you
1884760	1890360	haven't been in that situation you know hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice picking apart
1890360	1895320	your face and body clocking your clothes and makeup digging up your past trying to deduce
1895800	1902520	your sexual pathology from the shape of your skull a lot of i mean a lot of it's hilarious to me now
1903160	1908760	but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain but that pain spurred me to work on my glow up
1908760	1914680	like it was the cure for cancer like my life depended on it which is basically how it felt
1914680	1921880	now sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as as one tweeter put it cripplingly obsessed with
1921880	1925400	passing and passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me but that was something that i wanted to
1925400	1932280	do for me but glam to me is not about passing i think i actually pass better in no makeup than i
1932280	1936760	do an eye shadow out to here you know a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here and people think
1936760	1942360	she's just really into makeup or instagram or cosplay or something but when i do it i think
1942360	1950600	it looks like drag which serves to call more attention to my situation but on youtube i mean
1950600	1955240	clearly i don't try to pass as a normal woman everyone here knows i'm trans anyway so i'm not going to pass as a normal woman
1955400	1961400	what's the point i would describe this presentation as female impersonator and that's basically what
1961400	1967880	i am a female female impersonator and i present this way because it's fun i find it artistically
1967880	1972920	fulfilling and let's be honest there's part of me that always wanted to be that kind of
1972920	1978520	larger-than-life superwoman but i'm also creating special effects for the camera as sprinkles says
1978520	1984760	glamour offers a strange over-performance of gender signifiers a tenuously woven layer of super
1985400	1991800	which is so distracting that it successfully hides the transgendered body beneath now a lot of
1991800	1997560	leftist trans people have grown disillusioned with the individual class mobility represented
1997560	2003640	by glamour as well as by transition glow-up narratives and i think that disillusionment
2003640	2009080	and a growing revolutionary sentiment are at the heart of this intense anger and resentment
2009080	2014920	i've noticed a lot of trans women have for drag queens for glamorous trans instagram models and
2015720	2022520	let's be honest for me here's sprinkles one more time as long as an mtf's public acceptance is
2022520	2027480	gauged by her ability to emulate glamorous body and style requirements that elude most
2027480	2033480	quote real women then i'll have to ask you to pardon this transgendered writer for not feeling
2033480	2040360	represented by rupaul any more than my mother feels represented by marilyn monroe or princess
2040360	2045320	die a lot of trans women are basically fed up with having to serve the world of fantasy
2045400	2050280	all the time they want to be seen for who they are without doing any of that they're fed up
2050280	2057160	with glamour they're fed up with realness they're fed up with rupaul and a lot of them are pretty
2057160	2065160	fed up with me and i open i open six envy the marxist art critic john berger called glamour
2065160	2070920	the happiness of being envied being envied is a solitary form of reassurance
2070920	2075320	it depends precisely upon not sharing your experiences with those who envy you
2075400	2080840	but being envied is a form of happiness only in the imagination the actual experience of being
2080840	2087880	envied sucks this is the risk of opulence it invites not just enchanted admiration but also
2087880	2095160	envy and where envy goes the guillotine follows or at least vindictive taxation this is why the
2095160	2100520	experienced rich know to tone down the opulence build a nice high wall around their properties
2100520	2105160	and make a lot of high-profile charitable donations we could call this kind of strategizing
2105400	2111160	the public relations of success it certainly helps to have a rags to riches story especially if you
2111160	2116680	can make other people feel included in some way in your success that's part of the appeal of hip-hop
2116680	2122120	opulence is that it seems to elevate not just a single performer but an entire underclass
2122680	2129320	conversely being perceived as exclusionary elitist or snobbish is going to cost you big in terms of
2129320	2135240	envy management youtube music critic todd in the shadows did a review of ariana grande's song seven
2135400	2140360	rings in which he basically drags ariana who apparently is white for appropriating a bunch
2140360	2145240	of hip-hop rags to riches signifiers without any of the subtext of starting from the bottom
2145240	2152040	she's not showcasing a triumph over adversity she's just a white girl who likes stuff we started
2152040	2158280	from the bottom now the whole team is here so in todd's words the song is a grotesque bullying
2158280	2164600	vip only privilege flex of a mean girl shoving her wealth in your face i actually like that song but
2165400	2171560	i'm into that sort of thing bully me mommy oh fellow students as a case study in the public
2171560	2177880	relations of success and envy management let us compare and contrast two successful youtubers
2177880	2182840	jeffree star and gigi gorgeous there's enough similarities between them for the differences to
2182840	2188360	be interesting they're both lgb and or t they're both white they're both blonde sometimes they're
2188360	2194120	both feminine they're both rich and they both flaunt their opulent lifestyles but nonetheless
2195400	2202440	they seem to like jeffree star whereas gigi well i don't want to say people don't like her but
2202440	2208760	they don't relate to her the best example of this is her 2017 video i wear walmart for a week
2208760	2215480	with its gasp inducing life to dislike ratio let's analyze what went wrong here so for today's video
2215480	2221080	i thought we would take it to a place i've never been walmart so that's a bad start gorge
2221080	2225400	most americans have been to walmart never having been marks your upbringing as a woman
2225400	2231240	as upper middle class at least treating going to walmart as some kind of challenge kind of comes
2231240	2236280	across as you and your rich friends being like what if we pretend to be poor for a day i wonder
2236280	2242920	if we're gonna see any people at walmart you know that website baby's crying the trauma gigi no you
2242920	2248200	need to turn the shade down like like 20 notches gorge i keep taking my on this cart i'm
2248200	2254680	literally gonna have bruises can someone remake these carts please it's dangerous they're gonna
2255400	2266040	gorge what should we get next it's maybe like a gown for a red carpet do they sell gowns here
2266040	2272120	this to me is peak gigi strolling down the aisles of walmart with a two liter bottle of mountain dew
2272120	2278360	that she's plucked from the shelves saying i need something for a red carpet do they have gowns here
2278360	2284920	this to me is an iconic fashion moment this is naive camp this is everything the idea that she
2285400	2301020	is giving people the privilege of a body first
2301020	2304680	this is the second time i've done a close reading of a gg
2304680	2309800	video it's getting kinda weird also why hasn't she answered my letters step on my throat mommy
2309800	2314600	now let's look at jeffree star jeffree does similar kinds of videos to gigi he's even done his own
2314600	2314680	video wearing white and hisété said why do you think you'd do a gg with a bar in black and not an ashley bar on it without a Smackdown Gardener's Stamping her face and then research what you also install as download aproof il Sister
2315400	2320040	for a day, which people loved. Now my first impulse when explaining the differences in
2320040	2324760	public perception is to scream sexism. And there's maybe a little of that going on.
2325140	2329600	I do think a rich woman is more irritating to people than a rich man, but there's clearly more
2329600	2334900	than that going on here. Jeffree's fans are, I assume, mostly women and not rich women,
2335280	2339780	regular women. The women who work at the dollar store love him. I'm like your biggest fan.
2340400	2344540	Ordinary people actually enjoy watching Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of designer bags
2344540	2349100	and clothes because they either live vicariously through him or they see him as aspirational.
2349100	2354000	It's the same reason why poor people have always enjoyed watching reality TV shows about the
2354000	2359600	extremely wealthy. The centerpiece of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's self-made. He represents
2359600	2364040	himself as having started from the bottom. You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing
2364040	2369500	and just generally seems like he hasn't let his wealth go to his head. A good example of this is
2369500	2374280	his private jet Burger King mukbang. Now at first you might think that a private jet is not very
2374280	2374520	relatable. But it's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not.
2374540	2380760	But the Burger King aspect brings it back down to earth. Jeffree seems like he's been to Burger
2380760	2386220	King before. He's able to order fluently. He's even kind of charming to the cashier. He doesn't
2386220	2393800	like scoff or pinch his nose at anything. Also, the Gucci barrette. Whereas Gigi, I mean, don't
2393800	2399380	get me wrong, I do love Gigi, but I don't know if sis would make it out of Burger King alive.
2399380	2404040	You know, she'd commit some terrible upper-class solacism. Like, I don't know,
2404040	2408980	not understanding the concept of a value meal. I'm sure Gigi would make an entertaining video,
2409160	2414660	just not a relatable video. You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis from the toilet seat
2414660	2418800	and do a story time about that. That's really when Gigi's at her best. She kind of comes back
2418800	2423040	down to earth whenever she's serving real transsexual housewives of Beverly Hills meets
2423040	2428600	David Cronenberg. So I'm like, I see this white little chiclet in my hand. I'm feeling with my
2428600	2433580	tongue and I'm like, oh my God. Economic inequality in this country has always been
2434040	2439260	controlled by the fact that people basically like the rich. Yeah, we judge people who live
2439260	2446280	in McMansions and we get irritated by elitist out of touch behavior, but ultimately we have no choice
2446280	2451920	but to stand. And the people we stand the hardest are people like Jeffree Star, who in a way seems
2451920	2457560	like a poor person who just so happens to be very rich. Now, if inequality increases enough,
2457560	2463800	I suspect the standing will stop because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend $69,000 in one trip to
2464040	2468600	a taunt store if what you're doing is fantasizing about what you would buy with that much money.
2468600	2473880	But if you're thinking about how $69,000 could pay off your life-ruining medical debt or about
2473880	2478500	how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments for your dying life, this kind of thing will
2478500	2483780	start getting under your skin. And eventually people will start building guillotines again.
2483780	2489540	In fact, the only way I can imagine a revolution happening in this country is if rich people start
2489540	2493620	behaving as badly as possible. So this isn't your dream job? No.
2494040	2496200	You're free, right? Oh, whatever you want. Okay, great.
2497760	2499560	7. Ruin
2502740	2511620	Good evening, gorge. Ever notice how most vampires are like counts or queens or at least rich? I
2511620	2517560	guess some are edgy biker teens, but I don't associate with that trash. Gothic horror really
2517560	2523440	got started as a genre with 18th and 19th century novels, which were usually set in an old decaying
2524040	2529500	mansion. By the late 19th century, the aristocracy had lost a lot of its relevance as a class,
2529500	2535560	so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula represented a dying world order and also
2535560	2539880	maybe the metaphorical bloodsucking of commoners by the landed gentry.
2539880	2545700	Vampires were also usually seducers, and the aristocrat seducer trope had actually played
2545700	2550860	an important role in turning public opinion against the nobility. So the gothic aesthetic
2550860	2553800	is an aesthetic of dead and decaying opulence.
2554040	2559500	And that aesthetic has evolved over time, from the ruins of a medieval castle to the iconic
2559500	2564660	haunted house, which in American horror is usually a decaying Victorian mansion.
2564660	2570540	It's a trope with an interesting backstory. During the Gilded Age, industrialization produced a new
2570540	2576000	wealthy class of people who built what were essentially 19th century McMansions. When the
2576000	2580860	Great Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian mansions were abandoned and began to decay,
2580860	2583800	which gave them morbid associations that made
2583800	2588960	them perfect for stories about hauntings and psychos and weirdos.
2588960	2596640	So ruined opulence becomes gothic, which kind of makes you think, we live in an age of opulence
2596640	2602100	and inequality and growing irritation with abusive men in power, the middle class is shrinking,
2602100	2607920	social unrest is on the rise, it seems like a new economic order could be on the horizon.
2607920	2613680	When the opulence of our age decays, will there be a new gothic aesthetic of ruined
2613800	2617580	shopping malls? Well, there kind of already is.
2617580	2623580	The urban explorer Dan Bell is a YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series, in which he explores
2623580	2628380	the ruins of abandoned shopping malls, for example, the now demolished Owings Mills Mall
2628380	2633840	just north of Baltimore. The mall opened in 1986 as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.
2633840	2640140	Champagne, gold dust, and pink feathers heralded in a new era for Owings Mills.
2640140	2643680	Today's opening of the Owings Mills Fashion Mall does not only mean a new,
2643800	2649380	high-fashion place to shop, it also means lots of new developments and jobs for Baltimore County.
2649380	2654840	It had a Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth Avenue. It was a big, high-end mall.
2654840	2661380	But in 1992, a woman who worked as a cleaner at Saks was murdered during an armed robbery on the
2661380	2665940	trail between the mall and the Baltimore metro station. After the murder, the mall got a
2665940	2672240	reputation for being unsafe, and slowly the stores closed down. Dan recorded two videos at Owings
2672240	2673380	Mills in 2015, when he was working at the Baltimore Metro Station. He said,
2673380	2679920	when only five of the original 155 stores remained, he takes us through the strangely
2679920	2688020	clean and empty halls, the drained fountains, the gutted food court. Watching these videos seems to
2688020	2694440	provoke an emotional response in a lot of people. Some say they feel nostalgic or sad, some express
2694440	2700560	rage at the waste and futility, some find it creepy or even horrifying, and some have a dark
2700560	2702960	sense of humor about the absurdity of it all. One commenter said,
2703380	2711480	I think it is still hitting people with slow-motion shock that the 20th century is really over. In the
2711480	2717900	80s, this looked like the start of a big new world of wealth for everyone. In fact, it was the last
2717900	2726000	gasp of 20th century general prosperity. I agree with all these comments, and I feel every one of
2726000	2733080	these emotions. I think there is a new aesthetic sensibility emerging here, a gothic aesthetic for
2733380	2740640	the 21st century, this decaying opulence that is the carcass of 20th century consumerism. Oh,
2740640	2746520	it gives me a chill, my nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down my spine.
2749100	2755820	The Owings Mills Mall was totally demolished in late 2016, and Dan's final video about it, we see
2755820	2762240	clips from his earlier Owings Mills videos intercut with absolutely post-apocalyptic footage of the
2762240	2763320	half-demolished ruin.
2763380	2770340	It's not like the feeling of exploring a ruined temple or abbey, where you somehow perceive the
2770340	2776520	spiritual significance of the original building. In a dead mall, you do sense the ghosts of the
2776520	2783120	shoppers and the workers, their aspirations and material longings, but what does the crumbling
2783120	2790380	wreckage of a J.C. Penney really mean? That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.
2793380	2801960	All right, comrades, I've said my piece. I'll come quietly. There's no reason to tie me down. I mean,
2801960	2810360	unless you're into that. In which case, by all means. No, I won't resist. I accept my fate.
2823380	2825380	Why am I even here?
2830380	2830780	05.!..
2830860	2831320	05.!..

2853380	2860300	Mano. I'm glad your father died. Let's just get that out there before I have to say it.
2860780	2862340	And let's be honest, definitely a tranny chaser.
2867060	2872540	Gosh, I sure do think I'm funny. But he was an incel and definitely a tranny chaser.
2873980	2879040	Look at me. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of what I've written. Huh?
2879040	2884340	Can't, yeah. But I'm saying his name wrong because I'm an asshole.
2886000	2891880	I hope you're enjoying this there and watching me rub snot into my hands as I shriek naked in a tub full of jewels.
2892240	2895760	How much leg do we want to get in here? A lot, I assume.
2896380	2899760	I'm just getting oil all over my fur. Great. It's not real fur, whatever.
2900420	2903260	Let me clarify that for the vegans in my comments section.
2903920	2907480	Ugh, moral people. There's one that I can't stand.
2909040	2911200	It's people who have some sense of decency.
2911860	2913980	Okay. Is a hair light really a good idea?
2914760	2918080	Why don't we illuminate my frizziness? Who invented that?
2918280	2921620	An asshole. But what about a bartender who owns the bar he works in?
2921940	2923800	I guess I'll say shitty to be feminist.
2924700	2927040	Christ. The demands of these people.
2927420	2928640	Those bucky teeth, man.
2930960	2935060	It's like, it's like being tabby. Tabby, tabby.
2935980	2939020	That is a question that will haunt me.
2939700	2940660	To the grave.
2942940	2944560	So happy and stupid.
2945700	2946180	Okay.
