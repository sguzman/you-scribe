0	12720	Hi guys! It's me, Tiffany Tumbles, transgender, YouTube sensation. Welcome to my world! Every
12720	19280	week I upload new beauty and makeup tutorials. Come get ready with me! So I'm going to go in
19280	26240	with the color Snowflake from my Winter Rose palette using a flaunt 325 brush. Smoke it out.
26240	32560	Do you want to just kind of judge it? That looks bomb. It's major. I'm vibing it. I'm obsessed.
32560	43360	It's literally snatched. Love, love, love. Yes. Okay. I'm not living for it. Oh my god.
44480	50560	I think I glued my eyes shut. Fuck. But I'm not just a pretty face. I also share plenty
50560	55040	of opinions about controversial social and political issues. Even though I'm trans,
55040	56240	I refuse to be.
56240	61760	a victim because I prefer to take control of my own life, which is why I support our president,
61760	66560	Donald J. Trump. Make traps gay again. Bye!
84480	86000	Hi! I'm Jackie
86240	92320	Jackson, host of the Freedom Report, where- I'm sorry, why does my studio look like a Japanese
92320	99760	drag queen redecorated an Italian bordello? It's hard to move past it. Anyway, tonight my guests
99760	104400	are two transgender YouTubers from opposite ends of the political spectrum, but I've brought them
104400	109120	here together to engage in a rational, free-thinking debate about a timeless question.
114880	115920	Are traps gay?
116240	121120	First guest is Adria Finley, host of the popular YouTube series Intersectional AF.
121840	122640	Clarence?
122640	128400	Hey YouTube, it's your girl Adria. Have you ever considered that transphobia is racist?
129680	134960	Okay. My other guest is returning to the show. It's Tiffany Tumbles. Now, Tiffany,
134960	138800	you've had a major change of heart since the last time you were on this program, isn't that right?
138800	143440	That's right, Jackie. It's pretty embarrassing, but I used to be a non-binary SJW.
143440	146080	You poor thing. Could you say a little bit about how you came-
146080	147840	I came to take the red pill.
147840	151120	Well, I posted a couple tweets about how there are only two genders,
151120	156160	and how I was tired of trendy teens who don't experience dysphoria calling themselves trans,
156160	161120	and next thing I know, everyone's calling me a TERF and a traitor, so I said, you know what?
161120	164720	I'm out. I'm not gonna put up with this culture of silencing and shame.
164720	167200	I think that's just so brave of you.
167200	171520	Yeah, wow, so brave of you to come on talk shows to discuss how silenced you are.
171520	176000	Shut up, Adria. I had just come out as trans, and I was putting myself out there online.
176080	181520	And then like that, the trans community dropped me like a piece of trash, and I had no support. Nothing.
181520	185040	I was absolutely alone. Do you have any idea what that felt like?
185040	189760	Your leftist allies are not your friends, Adria. One wrong move and you're dead to them.
189760	190880	Those are not friends.
190880	193120	Well, you have real friends now, Tiffany.
193120	196880	I think you're gonna fit right in with this new group of dangerous intellectuals
196880	199920	who are finally taking a stand against the authoritarian left
199920	202720	and speaking out against politically correct dogma.
202720	205520	Why don't we go ahead and roll a clip of one of Tiffany's newest videos?
206080	209680	So I'm gonna go in with a highlighter, pop it on my cheeks,
210320	214400	pop it on my brow till I'm literally blinding.
214400	215760	I am glowing.
216800	219840	She's doing all right, but I'm not living for it.
220640	222320	You know what else I'm not living for?
223600	224960	The Muslims.
224960	227360	Tiffany, you are so funny.
227360	230000	I'm sorry, are we just gonna ignore the blatant racism?
230000	231120	How is that racist?
231120	232880	Muslims are a religion, not a race.
232880	235680	Yeah, Adria, Muslims are a religion, not a race.
235680	238960	Well, in this country, Islam and race are inextricably tied together.
238960	239600	You can't just...
240400	242560	Look, you both know exactly what I'm talking about.
242560	244240	Let's try to get back on track here.
244240	246880	So, Adria, traps.
247600	248800	Are they gay?
248800	250800	Look, there's so many things wrong with the question
250800	253280	that the only way to answer it is to deconstruct it.
253280	255040	First of all, what are traps?
255040	256160	Are they trans women?
256160	257920	Because if you're calling trans women traps,
257920	262160	then you're directly playing into the lie that trans women are tricking or trapping men.
262160	265520	A lie that reinforces the mentality that causes men to murder us.
265680	268320	Well, I don't think trap is necessarily a trans woman.
268320	269440	What about anime?
269440	273040	Okay, so the word trap was invented by English-speaking anime fans.
273040	276640	The Japanese word is otokonoko, which just means a male cross-dresser.
276640	278640	There's no implication of tricking men.
278640	282720	But the word trap is sometimes used in English as a slur against trans women.
282720	284560	So when you tell us that's not what it means,
284560	287840	you're gaslighting the shit out of us because we've all heard it used as a slur.
287840	290080	Adria, you don't get to speak for all trans women.
290080	292080	We're not all offended all the time.
292080	294320	I actually happen to identify as a trap.
294320	295600	Yeah, Adria, she identifies.
295600	296720	She identifies as a trap.
296720	298720	Well, she's in the sunken place.
298720	300400	And Tiffany, that's pretty reckless.
300400	302720	Doesn't it bother you at all that if some guy murders you,
302720	303760	his defense is gonna be,
303760	305920	well, she was a trap, I was tricked.
305920	307840	And you'll have contributed to that way of thinking.
307840	309280	Well, what do you care, Adria?
309280	311200	No one's gonna be trapped by you anyway.
311200	312560	Oh, spicy.
312560	313920	The fuck did you just say?
313920	317200	I said, no shade, but you don't really look like a woman.
317200	320080	Jackie, are you gonna allow your guest to talk to me like this?
320080	322800	Well, Tiffany, you could stand to be a little nicer.
322800	325520	Look, dragging bitches is what I do.
325520	327200	Facts over feels, hunty.
327200	329760	Well, Adria, don't you think she has a bit of a point?
329760	331600	Like, if you wanna be taken seriously,
331600	333280	you could put a little more effort in.
333280	335440	I mean, what is this, a men's shirt?
335440	337520	How are you gonna attract men with that?
337520	339520	I'm not trying to attract men.
339520	340560	I'm a lesbian.
340560	343040	I'm sorry, maybe this is a stupid question,
343040	346800	but how can you be a trans woman and a lesbian?
346800	349840	Well, I'm a woman and I like women.
349840	351200	I don't know about that.
351200	352160	Sounds debatable.
352160	354560	I'm sorry, I didn't realize when I agreed to do this show
354560	355280	that I was signing up
355280	356800	for the transphobia special.
356800	358400	Transphobia?
358400	360720	Well, Adria, I think that's very unfair.
360720	364240	I mean, I've invited two trans women to be on my program
364240	366720	and I'll have you know that one of my best friends
366720	368480	happens to be a gay man.
368480	371040	And what could be transphobic about that?
371040	372480	See, Adria, you're the reason
372480	374160	why everyone hates trans people.
374160	376240	You're obnoxious and offended by everything
376240	377600	and everyone feels like they have to tread
377600	378720	on eggshells around you.
378720	379760	Thank you, Tiffany.
379760	381280	See, you're one of the good ones.
381280	382320	You're a good trans.
382320	384480	Is this what you wanna do with your life, Tiffany?
384480	385200	Be the laptop?
385200	386640	Dog of people like this?
386640	387200	No.
387200	389920	I wanna actually work toward the acceptance of trans people
389920	391840	by being patient and agreeable
391840	393040	and by looking the part
393040	394800	and not by screeching transphobia
394800	395680	at everyone who doesn't meet
395680	397440	your impossible standard of wokeness.
397440	400160	And you're gonna do that by identifying as a trap, huh?
400160	402400	Just keep reinforcing and excusing bigotry
402400	403840	until it magically goes away.
403840	405280	Well, does it occur to you, Tiffany,
405280	406560	that you're not gaining acceptance
406560	407920	for anyone but yourself
407920	409200	and the only reason you're accepted
409200	410960	is that you don't challenge the status quo?
410960	413280	I'm sorry, I need to interrupt this exchange of ideas
413280	414720	because I feel like we're just getting hung up
414720	416000	on terminology.
416000	418160	Look, Adria, if you don't like the word trap,
418160	419680	we just won't use the word trap.
419680	420960	The real question is,
420960	423280	is it gay to be attracted to trans women?
423280	424320	It is if you're a woman.
424320	425920	No, I mean for men.
425920	429120	Like, Tiffany, do you date straight men or gay men?
429120	431760	Well, all the men I've dated only date women,
431760	433680	but if they're attracted to me,
434800	436800	I mean, it's not the straightest thing, is it?
436800	437440	Why not?
437440	440000	You look like a woman and I know that you know
440000	442240	that gay men are not attracted to these tits.
442240	444560	Well, I am serving up fishy realness.
444720	446000	So, granted.
446000	447760	Well, doesn't she have a point, though, Adria?
447760	449920	I mean, sure, she looks like a woman,
449920	452480	but she does have XY chromosomes.
452480	454000	When was the last time you were attracted
454000	455680	to a person's chromosomes?
455680	457520	That's not how sexuality works.
457520	459840	We're attracted to a person's perceptible features,
459840	461440	not molecular biology.
461440	463280	Okay, sure, but I mean,
463280	465360	a lot of trans women still have their penis,
465360	468640	and you gotta admit, that seems kinda gay.
468640	471280	Jackie, you really have no clue what you're doing, do you?
471280	473440	We live in a world where there's no shortage of men
473440	474720	who wanna date trans women.
474720	477440	But there's an intense stigma on dating trans women,
477440	478720	and it's actually dangerous,
478720	481520	because what happens is if a man's friends find out
481520	483120	that the woman he's dating is trans,
483120	486000	he may try to preserve his toxic masculine dignity
486000	488960	by lashing out violently against the trans woman he's dating.
488960	490640	And this happens again and again.
490640	493600	And every time you suggest that dating a trans woman is gay,
493600	494960	you're adding to that stigma,
494960	496720	and you're making the world a more dangerous
496720	498160	and violent place for trans women.
498160	501200	All right, I'm not trying to use violent words or whatever.
501200	504000	I just don't understand how a person who's attracted to women
504000	506320	could be attracted to a person with a penis.
506320	508400	Well, if you wanna know, I'll tell you.
508400	509440	I am a lesbian.
509440	512400	I'm only attracted to women, including trans women.
512400	514240	And when I'm attracted to a trans woman,
514240	515760	I perceive her as a woman.
515760	518960	And if she has a penis, I perceive it not in isolation,
518960	521360	but as a part of her female body.
521360	524800	So I perceive it not as a male penis, but as a girl dick.
524800	526160	I'm sorry, what?
526160	527840	What is girl dick?
527840	529040	The feminine penis.
529040	529840	Oh no.
529840	530800	Oh, come on.
530800	532240	This is nonsense.
532240	533840	How could a penis possibly be?
533840	534640	Feminine.
534640	536880	Well, it's feminine because it's on a woman,
536880	539760	but also because hormones actually change the anatomy
539760	541920	and functionality of the penis.
541920	543680	Ugh, shut up, Adria.
543680	544640	Just shut up.
544640	545600	Wait, really?
545600	546560	How is it different?
546560	547920	Well, I'm glad you asked.
547920	550240	More needs to be said about the feminine penis.
550240	553040	Why is no one talking about the feminine penis?
553040	553760	Kill me now.
553760	555600	So to start with, it doesn't get as hard,
555600	557120	it doesn't really ejaculate,
557120	559280	and it has a different mouth feel.
559280	561040	Can we please talk about the mouth feel?
561040	563120	Why is no one talking about the mouth feel?
563120	565760	I don't think that's necessary.
565760	567920	I'm just trying to wrap my head around this.
567920	570480	You are attracted to women with dicks,
571200	572240	but not to men.
572240	573280	That's correct.
573280	574640	I don't like man dick.
574640	577440	It's coarse and rough and irritating,
577440	579120	and it comes everywhere.
579120	580320	Not like girl dick.
580320	582320	Girl dick is everything soft and smooth.
582320	583680	Ugh, what is that?
583680	584480	Star Wars?
584480	585120	Ugh.
585120	587280	Do you also build computers for a living?
587280	588640	I mean, guilty.
588640	590320	I also enjoy wearing knee socks.
593120	596240	And let me guess, your girlfriend is a communist cat girl.
596240	597360	My sweet love.
597360	599760	Wait, you're dating that crazy Antifa cat?
599760	601520	Well, we're in the same polycule.
601520	602480	I don't know what that means,
602480	604480	and I'm not, like, prejudiced or anything,
604480	608240	but I'm just not sold on this idea of trans lesbianism.
608240	611680	Like, if you're born male and you're attracted to women,
611680	613760	how is it not just heterosexuality?
613760	616240	Well, my girlfriend is also trans,
616240	619120	so if you follow your logic to its conclusion...
619680	620800	Okay, so.
621760	622560	You're a woman.
623120	624080	Who's born a man.
625040	626480	And you like women.
627120	628400	But you're dating a woman.
629200	630640	A woman who has a penis.
630640	633360	You are a female penis that used to be a male penis.
634160	636480	And you're attracted to women.
636480	637760	But you're born a man.
638640	640240	And you're attracted to women.
640240	644560	But the woman you're dating has a penis.
644560	646400	So that means you are gay.
646400	650240	But you're gay in the opposite way as the kind of gay that you were born as.
650240	652160	I can go over it with you again after the show,
652160	652960	if you need some extra time.
652960	656960	Why am I constantly surrounded by homosexuals?
656960	659280	Adria, just stop talking.
659280	661120	Look, I don't care what you do in private,
661120	662800	but I'm sorry to break it to you,
662800	665760	the world is not ready to hear about trans lesbianism.
665760	669280	What trans people need right now is people like you to keep a low profile,
669280	671760	and people like me to be our representatives.
671760	673520	Because I act like a normal woman,
673520	674960	and I date normal men,
674960	677600	and I don't have a cat girl girlfriend with a girl dick.
677600	678100	Ugh.
678720	680800	Also, I look fucking gorgeous.
680800	682720	I'm sorry, but that matters.
682720	686000	Well, you look just fine, but let's not get arrogant, sweetheart.
686000	687520	You're not Blair White.
687520	689920	Well, I haven't saved the money to have work done,
689920	691360	so that's not a fair comparison.
691360	692640	What work are you having done?
692640	694000	I'm gonna lower my hairline,
694000	695680	shave some bone off my jaw,
695680	697040	reshape my brow,
697040	698400	get some lip injections,
698400	700320	maybe botox my forehead.
700320	702640	Oh, and I'm gonna fix my nose, obviously.
702640	704320	What's wrong with your nose?
704320	706000	It's kind of big and mannish.
706000	707920	Well, my nose looks kind of like that.
707920	709600	Are you saying I look mannish?
709600	711200	Are you saying I look ugly?
711200	712560	What are you trying to say, Tiffany?
712720	713920	Why are you doing this to me?
713920	715200	Why are you doing this to women?
716080	717840	I'm not doing anything to women.
717840	718480	What?
718480	720960	Look, we can't all become hairless sex dolls.
721840	723840	That's a terrible thing to say to a trans woman.
723840	726000	She has to work really hard to be seen as female,
726000	726880	and you just don't.
726880	728400	Shut the hell up, Adria.
728400	729920	Don't get offended for me.
729920	731440	Don't condescend to me.
731440	732400	I'm not a victim.
733280	735520	Okay, so I'm not as young as I used to be,
736080	739200	but my fiancé still thinks I'm beautiful.
739200	740160	Oh my god.
740160	741840	I need to not be around straight people
741840	742640	for a long time.
742720	743360	I'm after this.
746960	748560	All right, let's forget about it.
748560	751360	I'm fine.
752080	753600	Tiffany, are you fine?
753600	754640	I am fine.
754640	756880	To be clear, I'm not fine with any of this.
756880	758880	Look, why don't we just edit this whole thing out?
758880	761280	Let's shoot the closer and we'll fix it in post.
762640	765680	Well, we may never know whether traps are gay,
765680	768560	but the important thing is that we talked about it.
768560	770640	I'm Jackie Jackson for The Freedom Report,
770640	772400	where the debate never stops.
772960	774800	Your mascara is running.
774800	775920	Get out of my studio.
775920	776800	Both of you.
778560	779060	Get out.
779840	780400	We're done.
788800	789680	Hi, Nick.
789680	790560	Yeah, I'm finished.
791680	792960	Well, it was a shit show.
794400	796320	No, Adria was fine.
796320	798000	She was cringe as fuck the whole time.
798000	798880	Let's have her back.
799440	800640	Tiffany was the problem.
800640	802560	She kept veering off message.
802560	804000	And she got emotional.
806080	807280	Yeah, don't invite her back.
809200	810400	Get Blair next time.
812160	812960	And the week after.
813520	814640	Can we get Kanye West?
814640	815520	We can't get Kanye.
816720	817680	Get Candace Owens.
818400	820400	Oh, and what have you done to my studio?
822240	823440	Hey, Adria, look.
824160	826960	I'm sorry I was rude to you back there, okay?
826960	828960	It's just that I've been working so hard
828960	830720	to win acceptance for trans people,
830720	831920	to show everyone that we're normal,
831920	833520	that we're just like them.
834080	837520	And when you show up looking like that
837520	838960	and acting like that,
838960	840560	it's just hard for me to watch
840560	842560	all my hard work be undone, you know?
842560	844400	Like, you can't be talking about
844400	847440	the feminine penis in front of cis people.
847440	849920	Tiffany, you need to get far away from me right now
849920	851600	for your own physical safety.
851600	853200	Oh my god, you crazy freak.
861920	863840	Donald Trump is right over here here,
863840	865400	500了我也
865400	867600	I said I can't make you guys cry
867600	881760	If you battery out,
881760	883840	you're getting out of here.
883840	884960	You're getting old.
884960	885600	I am.
885600	886080	I got Aquí,
886080	886240	and she sticks out
886240	887360	like a bee
887360	888320	You are not, black and white.
888320	889920	I got people who see me because I'm Pinocchio.
889920	890960	Don't blame ourselves for that.
890960	891760	We don't do that every day.
891760	896400	I hate Adria. She looks like a man-beast.
896400	900800	Society needs to stop enabling these ridiculous delusions.
900800	904880	Ah, this hun. People are gonna see this and they're gonna think this is what
904880	907840	trans people are.
907840	911520	You should not be representing us. They're nothing like me. I'm nothing like them.
911520	917040	I need you to relax.
921760	933200	No, I want to act a punk toward the acceptance of the truth.
933200	937680	Well, it sucked. You're gonna do that by identifying as a trap.
937680	943120	I look good, but Adria's fucking everything up.
943120	946400	All right, what are they saying?
947760	950160	Fuck it.
951760	967040	Okay, so I don't pass perfectly.
967040	970640	But at least I know that. I may have a mental illness, but I'm
970640	973920	I'm self-aware about it. I'm not delusional.
973920	978800	I'm not like Adria. I'm nothing like her.
979600	981600	You know, it's fine. It's gonna be fine.
982160	984880	I'm gonna have the work done. I can fix this.
985920	989920	It's my fault for not working harder. You can't just expect society to...
991600	992480	I'm not a victim.
994560	998240	I am in control of my life.
1002800	1005360	I wish I were a woman.
1007680	1009360	Or anything but this.
1011600	1017600	I'm destroying my body.
1017600	1023600	Who could ever love this?
1023600	1029600	I'm just mutilating myself.
1029600	1033600	It's so disgusting.
1033600	1037600	God, I'm so disgusting.
1037600	1039600	It's so disgusting.
1039600	1041600	It's so disgusting. God, I'm so disgusting.
1041600	1043600	It's so disgusting.
1051600	1055600	I'm just using another drink.
1056960	1059920	I am not a victim.
1059920	1061920	I'm in complete control.
1061920	1063920	I am not a victim.
1063920	1065920	I am in complete control.
1071600	1101580	I don't know.
1101600	1131580	I don't know.
1131600	1161580	I don't know.
1161600	1175120	Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tobles.
1175480	1177760	Welcome to my world.
1191600	1221580	Hi guys, it's me, Tiffany Tobles.
1221600	1223480	And it's you, dear, head in the sand.
1224500	1227960	It's not really ignorance of mine.
1228200	1230740	It's the willful bigot's fight.
1231260	1249500	There is one thing that I cannot stand.
1249500	1251580	And it's you, dear, head in the sand.
1251600	1252300	And it's you, dear, head in the sand.
1253060	1256640	And it's not really ignorance of mine.
1256920	1259500	It's just the willful bigot's fight.
1261280	1263740	Don't let them define us.
