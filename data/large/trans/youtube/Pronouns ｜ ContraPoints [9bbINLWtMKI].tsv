246080	246100	just ingrown hairs i'm sure plenty of
266160	272600	So look, Shapiro, Benny, baby, I invite you to disenchant all of my fairy tales, to melt
272600	277800	away every crystal of my snowflakery, and henceforth dispense only the most scalding
277800	278800	tea.
278800	279800	All right, big boy?
279800	280800	Let's have it.
280800	284280	I'm willing to call Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner, I'm not willing to call Caitlyn Jenner
284280	285280	a she.
285280	286760	Because you can't change her sex, you can change her name.
286760	291440	Caitlyn Jenner is a man, a biological man, and if he were born with high doses of estrogen
291440	294180	in his bloodstream, he would also not be a woman.
294180	295180	You're determined by your chromosomes.
295180	300660	So the argument is that what it means to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype,
300660	302780	that is, XX sex chromosomes.
302780	307620	And if you don't have that karyotype, then you're not a she, and to call you she would
307620	309360	be tantamount to a lie.
309360	314940	I was just wondering what you see the detriment of society, like why we can't like let a transgender
314940	317060	like woman be called she or something.
317060	318380	Because it is a lie.
318380	322700	So since you think that calling a trans woman she is a lie, and you think that what it means
322700	323700	to be a she is to have a normal female karyotype, then you're not a she.
323700	324700	You're not a she.
324700	326100	You're a normal female karyotype.
326100	331200	And if you think that when we call a trans woman she, we are saying that she has a normal
331200	332560	female karyotype.
332560	338100	But hold on, I'm a transgender woman, and I've never claimed to have a normal female
338100	343280	karyotype, and yet my friends, lovers, and most strangers call me she, her, miss, ma'am,
343280	346220	girlfriend, ladies â€” good girl, good girl.
346220	347320	Just like that.
347320	348320	Don't stop.
348320	349320	Don't stop.
349320	350880	Are all of us deluded about my biology?
350880	351880	No.
351880	353820	It is not I who misunderstands biology, Ben Shapiro.
353820	354100	It's the other way around.
354700	357620	It is you who misunderstands language.
357620	359420	You have deceptively framed the debate
359420	362180	as a debate about biology, which it is not.
362180	364040	We all agree on the biology.
364040	367740	The actual subject of the debate is the proper use of words,
367740	370300	such as he, she, man, and woman.
370300	373380	But how do we decide on the correct way to use a word?
373380	376160	Well, there are two kinds of arguments we could make,
376160	378140	descriptive or prescriptive.
378140	380220	If we take the descriptive approach,
380220	382820	then what we must do is act like anthropologists
382820	385680	and study the way a word, for instance, she,
385680	387700	is used by a linguistic community,
387700	390420	and whatever the social convention is is what's correct.
390420	392640	But if we take the prescriptive approach,
392640	393980	then we must make an argument
393980	396980	about the way the word she should be used,
396980	398800	meaning we either defer to an authority,
398800	399960	such as the dictionary,
399960	402220	or my ruler on your wrist, you naughty boy,
402220	404540	or we must have some goal that we want to accomplish
404540	407880	by approving some uses of the word and prohibiting others.
407880	409540	Now, if we take the descriptive approach,
409540	412580	you lose, Ben Shapiro, because most people call me she,
412580	413860	and that's all there is to it.
413860	418820	What's more, your usage of a she and a he is ungrammatical.
418820	420820	You don't put an article before a pronoun.
420820	422960	That's not how pronouns work, you silly dum-dum.
422960	426360	Also, human sex chromosomes were discovered in 1905,
426360	428400	while the English pronouns he and she
428400	430240	originate in the Proto-Germanic language
430240	432840	spoken during the pre-Roman Iron Age of Northern Europe,
432840	434940	beginning around 500 BCE.
434940	437740	Therefore, by insisting that the singular third-person
437740	439080	pronouns of the English language
439080	440960	refer specifically to karyotype,
440960	442500	it is you, and not I, who is a she.
442500	445980	I, who is breaking from linguistic tradition, Ben Shapiro.
445980	447960	However, as a trans woman,
447960	451320	it's not generally in my interest to defer to traditions.
451320	454120	So, let's try out a prescriptive approach.
454120	457200	Without simply appealing to the way a word is already used,
457200	460660	how do we decide how a word should be used?
460660	462840	Language is by nature ambiguous,
462840	464940	and the way we attempt to disambiguate it
464940	467360	is often motivated by political goals.
467360	470340	Ben Shapiro thinks we should not call trans women she,
470340	472500	because his political goal is to reinforce
472500	474420	rigid conservative gender roles.
474420	477820	Whereas, I think we should call trans women she,
477820	480900	because my political goal is to live in a society
480900	482980	where I can achieve the same level of sadness
482980	484840	and dysfunction as everyone else.
484840	487340	It's analogous to the debate about same-sex marriage
487340	488400	from a decade ago.
488400	489840	Opponents argue the dictionary
489840	491560	and legal definition of marriage
491560	493680	was union between a man and a woman.
493680	495620	And the definition shouldn't be changed,
495620	498740	because it's the definition.
498740	501380	And how am I supposed to explain to my child?
501380	502380	And on the other hand,
502380	505080	Gay people argued that the definition should be changed,
505080	507600	because they wanted to achieve the same level of sadness
507600	509220	and dysfunction as everyone else.
509220	511740	And they succeeded, because as it turns out,
511740	514920	you can in fact change the definitions of words.
514920	518200	The dictionary is simply a usage guide, it's not the Bible.
518200	520240	And for that matter, you can change the Bible.
520240	522900	I mean, have you read the contemporary English version?
522900	525220	The prose is atrocious, appalling.
525220	526320	I won't stand for this.
526320	528360	But unlike the debate about gay marriage,
528360	529980	the question about trans womanhood
529980	532360	is more than just a political and legal dispute.
532360	534300	It seems to me that whatever Church, State,
534300	537300	and Merriam-Webster decide, trans women already are,
537300	538960	and will continue to be, women.
538960	541540	And to see why, I want to elaborate on an argument
541540	545360	posed to Ben Shapiro by my sometime rival, Blair White.
545360	549720	Yes, even though she's one of the YouTubers whomst is bad.
549720	551920	The debate begins with Ben Shapiro asserting
551920	554140	his usual position that pronouns are used
554140	557540	to designate so-called biological men and biological women.
557540	559740	Blair responds by observing that Ben's way
559740	562860	of using pronouns is, in her case, completely impractical.
562860	565720	Well, if you and I were to go to a business dinner,
565720	567280	or any kind of dinner, and you were meeting me
567280	569060	at a restaurant, and I was there first,
569060	572080	and I was in an orange shirt, and you had to tell,
572080	574960	you know, the host, I'm here to meet my friend, Blair,
574960	576800	and they said, okay, and you had to describe me
576800	579660	to take me to the table, you wouldn't say the man
579660	580880	in the orange shirt, you would say Blair,
580880	582180	you would say her over there.
582180	583700	Ben then responds, saying,
583700	584680	I think there's some truth to that,
584680	586780	meaning that I think that there is a utility
586780	589180	to the use of pronouns, but that's not quite the same
589180	592200	as suggesting that a transgender woman is a she
592200	593340	in the objective sense.
593340	594640	And Blair responds to that
594640	596760	with what I think is a very good analogy.
596760	599020	For instance, if someone were to adopt children,
599020	601500	there's no biological basis for calling them
601500	603200	that kid's parents, because they're not.
603200	604300	Like, they're just literally not,
604300	606160	there's no link at all biologically,
606160	608260	but there is a social reason to do it,
608260	609480	and there's a legal reason to do it.
609480	611080	Let's expand on that analogy.
611080	612580	Suppose you're an adoptive parent,
612580	614020	and you're arguing with someone who says
614020	616600	your adopted child isn't really your child,
616600	618280	and you aren't really a parent.
618280	619180	As evidence, they point out that,
619180	621420	point to the dictionary definition of parent,
621420	623940	one that begets or brings forth offspring.
623940	627100	You did not beget or bring forth offspring, they argue,
627100	629000	therefore you are not a parent.
629000	630880	Facts don't care about your feelings.
630880	633240	No matter how much you love and care for this child,
633240	635800	you'll never be anything but a glorified kidnapper.
635800	638060	I think it's clear that the person who makes this argument
638060	641280	is being uncivil, yes, being provocative,
641280	643940	controversial, politically incorrect.
643940	647940	But they're not just impolite, they're also wrong.
647940	649180	Because an adoptive parent
649180	651300	is, socially and functionally,
651300	654180	just as real a parent as a biological parent.
654180	657640	And to say otherwise is not just rude, it's false.
657640	660460	So, what do you have to say to that, Ben Shapiro?
660460	662400	I would say that we actually do have different descriptions
662400	664300	for adoptive parents than biological parents, right?
664300	666340	You'll say in shorthand that they're parents,
666340	667900	because they're all different types of parents,
667900	669980	but we do say adoptive parents.
669980	671680	Right, adoptive parents,
671680	673800	an entirely valid type of parent.
673800	676560	To call them parents is not a lie.
676560	679020	And then the question becomes, okay, exactly, is the,
679020	681820	the context that you were suggesting matters?
681820	683560	In what context are we talking about the parents?
683560	684860	Are we talking about a PTA meeting?
684860	686840	Okay, this person is the legal guardian,
686840	688580	and therefore the parent,
688580	690000	because parenting has two aspects, right?
690000	691620	There's the biological parentage,
691620	693840	and then there is the actual role of parenting.
693840	695620	So yes, there are some contexts
695620	696840	where we do need to distinguish
696840	698960	between biological and adoptive parents.
698960	701400	For instance, if a doctor is assessing a child's risk
701400	703140	of some hereditary disease,
703140	706220	they need to know if the parents are adoptive or biological.
706220	708760	But at the PTA meeting, and in most other contexts,
708760	710580	it doesn't matter in the slightest.
710580	711840	In the dinner conversation,
711840	713320	the same thing sort of holds true,
713320	715140	meaning there is the biological role of woman,
715140	716020	which you are not,
716020	718160	and then there is the, you look like a woman,
718160	720340	which is, I'm gonna describe you as a woman to the waiter
720340	721800	when he comes to direct me to the table.
721800	723420	Just when Ben seems on the cusp
723420	724600	of having a breakthrough,
724600	726360	he and Blair pause their argument
726360	729780	to congratulate themselves on how civil their discussion is.
729780	730600	From what I've seen,
730600	733380	a lot of your interactions with trans people,
733380	735380	they always end up kind of ugly.
735380	736220	You know what I mean?
736220	737060	There was the, I think,
737060	738600	I think the person's name was Zoe Turr,
738600	740660	there was the threat of physical violence.
740660	742360	What are your genetics, sir?
742360	745640	You cut that out now, or you'll go home in an ambulance.
745640	747060	Yeah, I mean, what's hilarious about this, Blair,
747060	748820	is literally the exact same thing
748820	750140	that I'm saying to you right now
750140	753080	is exactly what I said to Zoe Turr on the air.
753080	755460	But that's not exactly true, is it, Ben?
755460	758260	Zoe threatened you after you called her sir,
758260	760620	and you didn't call Blair sir, did you?
760620	762360	Why did you call Zoe sir?
762360	765260	What kind of reaction were you hoping to elicit,
765260	767960	oh distinguished destroyer of snowflakes?
767960	770340	I suppose you were just sticking to the facts.
770340	773860	I suppose sir is a strictly biological term.
773860	776120	Queen Guinevere said in days of old,
776120	780400	I knight thee, Lancelot, thou that art karyotypically male.
780400	781240	And you're exactly right.
781240	784740	When people start yelling at each other or tweeting out F you,
784740	786060	that's not a great way to change my mind.
786060	787640	It turns out that's not particularly convincing.
787640	791080	So what is a great way to change your mind, Ben Shapiro?
791080	793720	Did Blair bud you an inch with her rationality,
793720	796960	her even temper, her civility, her aesthetic?
796960	797960	It doesn't seem like she's going to change your mind.
797960	798880	She did.
798880	799960	At the end of this debate,
799960	803180	you regurgitate your original position undigested.
803180	804620	You know, I'm the editor of a pretty major site,
804620	806200	and my basic rule is that
806200	807640	when we're discussing people who are trans,
807640	809440	we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman,
809440	811480	and then refers to them by their biological pronoun,
811480	813820	because biology is the nature of the pronoun.
813820	816300	Biology is the nature of the pronouns?
816300	818080	Didn't Blair just demonstrate to you
818080	820460	that in most contexts that's not true for her?
820460	822960	Remember the analogy of adoptive parents.
822960	825300	There are some contexts where it makes sense
825300	827140	to distinguish between adoptive parents
827960	828960	and adoptive parents.
828960	831660	Likewise, there are some scientific and medical contexts
831660	833180	where it makes sense to distinguish
833180	835460	between transgender and cisgender,
835460	838100	or as you say, biological women.
838100	840140	For instance, when discussing who needs access
840140	841660	to certain reproductive healthcare
841660	843220	you think should be illegal.
843220	845260	But does this apply to pronouns?
845260	848240	That is, are pronouns technical biological terms
848240	850000	denoting karyotypes,
850000	851860	or are they part of the everyday language
851860	853920	we use to describe each other socially?
853920	855820	The answer is obvious.
855820	857960	There are no geneticists studying pronouns.
857960	860600	In fact, there is not a single biology textbook
860600	862260	with a chapter on the difference between
862260	864700	a he and a she.
864700	867200	There is no such thing as biological pronouns.
867200	869920	This is a phrase invented in the last decade
869920	872440	to describe the misgendering of trans people.
872440	873920	So as a trans woman,
873920	877260	I'm reintegrating myself into society as a woman.
877260	880140	She pronouns are therefore most appropriate for me,
880140	881860	regardless of my anatomy,
881860	884220	which is none of your business, Ben Shapiro.
884220	886120	Fascinating though it is.
886120	886960	And just as it's incorrect to tell an adoptive mother,
886960	887960	that she is a trans woman,
887960	890260	that her son is not her child,
890260	893360	to call me he is not just rude or insensitive.
893360	895820	It is, in effect, false.
895820	898100	But it is also rude and insensitive.
898100	900380	So even if you don't agree with me,
900380	901880	you could still not.
901880	903040	What's the harm, right?
903040	904580	I teach my almost four year old girl
904580	906480	that she can become a boy.
906480	907880	Then I think that is not only lying to her,
907880	908720	I think it's confusing her
908720	910260	and I think it's damaging to her psyche.
910260	912160	Oh yes, the classic argument.
912160	914300	How do I explain to my child?
914300	916480	Kill your shitty child for all I care.
916480	917640	That's simply not my problem.
917640	920400	I regret every night I spent with you, Ben Shapiro.
920400	923040	I'm in a new relationship now with a lesbian.
923040	924600	You and I are through.
924600	927200	I'm getting an abortion and you can't stop me.
933400	936680	It's disgusting what they allow on TV these days.
936680	939260	I won't allow my children to watch movies
939260	943100	unless there's at least a bloodbath or maybe an orgy.
943100	945380	But hey, I don't choose this schlock.
945380	946500	I just present it.
946500	947580	The second program
947640	950000	of tonight's science fiction double feature
950000	951420	is about a cult of chaos,
951420	954480	hell bent on destroying Western civilization.
954480	957140	I sure hope there's more sex and violence this time.
961820	964340	Hi boys, it's points again.
964340	966540	Same queen, new look, try to keep up.
966540	969560	In my previous video, nasty tea babe likes it rough,
969560	971420	I made an argument about why it's correct
971420	972920	to call trans women she,
972920	973980	but I'd be bullshitting you
973980	977000	if I only discussed fully integrated binary trans people.
977000	979880	Everyone basically calls them by their pronouns already.
979880	982760	Dingbats like Ben Shapiro have to exert conscious effort
982760	984940	to continue the charade of misgendering them.
984940	987720	The transgender woman from Orange is the New Black.
987720	988560	I never watched that show.
988560	989480	I've never watched that show either,
989480	990760	but she's on the cover of Time Magazine.
990760	991600	Oh.
991600	992600	Or he's on the cover of Time Magazine.
994880	996720	I limited my argument to trans women
996720	999520	who look the way society expects a woman to look
999520	1003000	because cis people have an easier time making sense of that.
1003000	1005400	But the reality is that in a lot of cases,
1005400	1006840	it's a little more complicated.
1006840	1009600	Now, as far as early transition trans people go,
1009600	1011480	I am fairly integrated.
1011480	1013880	Society basically gets that I'm a woman.
1013880	1015800	Without me having to explain my gender,
1015800	1019360	strangers usually default to she, her, miss, ma'am.
1019360	1022040	Hey, haven't I seen your videos on tgirllove.com?
1022040	1024600	But the truth is, I don't pass perfectly.
1024600	1028280	I got called sir last week by the cashier at H&M.
1028280	1030720	Not that I usually deign to shop at H&M,
1030720	1033200	but needless to say, it was a desperate emergency.
1033200	1036600	And by emergency, I mean I met a cute busboy at P.F. Chang's.
1036840	1038880	What happened next stays between me and the Lord,
1038880	1042480	but suffice to say that my blouse was irrevocably drenched in-
1044480	1046360	Okay, I embellished the story a little.
1046360	1047400	He wasn't cute.
1047400	1049040	So between being six foot one,
1049040	1050800	the horrific transsexual squawking
1050800	1052560	I try to pass off as my voice,
1052560	1054760	and my tragic inability to conduct myself
1054760	1056880	in a manner befitting a lady of good breeding,
1056880	1058000	your girl remains,
1058000	1060440	despite my desperate, painstaking efforts,
1060440	1061680	somewhat clockable.
1061680	1063320	You look great, hun.
1064240	1065960	In that debate between Ben and Blair,
1065960	1066800	Blair says that
1066840	1069080	pronoun usage boils down to what you look like.
1069080	1072080	But it really does kind of boil down to what you look like.
1072080	1074920	And it's true that most strangers will choose a pronoun for you
1074920	1076680	largely based on your appearance.
1076680	1078400	So appearance definitely matters,
1078400	1079840	but in my opinion, passing,
1079840	1081680	in the sense of looking like a cis woman,
1081680	1083680	is really the most important thing.
1083680	1086760	What matters more to me is the kind of vibe you give off,
1086760	1090760	the way you speak, the gestures, the conversational dynamic.
1090760	1092680	That kind of stuff to me is what makes a person
1092680	1095040	viscerally seem like a man or a woman.
1095040	1096480	So my goal isn't necessarily
1096480	1099080	to serve unclockable fish,
1099080	1101240	so much as to embody a certain kind of
1101240	1103880	diaphanous archetypal femininity.
1103880	1105880	In layman's terms, girl dick energy.
1105880	1109080	Also, I am gonna have a lot of plastic surgery, thank God.
1109080	1110480	Last month, I released a video called
1110480	1113000	Sexy Furry Pounded by Skinny T-Babe.
1113000	1114760	And a lot of trans people got mad at me
1114760	1116480	because they thought I was saying
1116480	1119080	that performing your gender is the only thing that matters
1119080	1121120	and that how you identify counts for nothing.
1121120	1122600	But that's not what I think.
1122600	1125120	I do prefer to argue that trans women are women
1125120	1126320	because we live the lives of them,
1126320	1129440	because I think that's a much more compelling argument
1129440	1132280	than I'm a woman because I psychologically identify
1132280	1134320	as a woman, which in my experience
1134320	1135680	doesn't really persuade anyone.
1135680	1137360	It's just too easy to poke holes in it.
1137360	1139320	But identity definitely does matter,
1139320	1140760	especially when it comes to pronouns.
1140760	1141640	And I'll explain why.
1141640	1144920	Now first, I should acknowledge that a lot of cis people
1144920	1147800	are very sensitive about anyone telling them
1147800	1149080	what pronouns to use.
1149080	1152040	So I'm gonna try to be respectful of your feelings
1152040	1154400	and what a difficult and personal issue
1154400	1155440	this must be for you.
1155440	1156280	After all,
1156320	1158120	we live in a repressive political era
1158120	1160160	despite the best efforts of hero professor,
1160160	1161400	Jordan B. Peterson.
1161400	1163320	But alas, he was too late.
1163320	1165960	Now we have Bill C-16, which compels speech
1165960	1167480	and sends people to jail for,
1167480	1170440	oh, it's been more than a year since Bill C-16 passed?
1170440	1173200	Let's check in on how many people have gone to jail
1173200	1174560	for pronoun misuse.
1186320	1191320	Oh, I guess that was a false alarm, huh?
1191440	1193080	God damn it.
1193080	1195960	Look, I'm not gonna tell you what pronouns you have to use.
1195960	1198080	I'm just gonna tell you how I use pronouns
1198080	1199360	and my reasoning behind it.
1199360	1201720	And you are welcome to use your free speech
1201720	1205200	to choose how much of an obstinate hobgoblin you wanna be.
1205200	1206040	Okay?
1206040	1207800	So back to identity.
1207800	1212120	If I were a cashier at the Emporium of Ethereal Trinkets
1212120	1215120	and a customer were to walk in looking like this,
1215120	1216120	I might ordinarily defend myself.
1216120	1218040	I might ordinarily default to female pronouns,
1218040	1219840	but that would be wrong.
1219840	1222720	Since I happen to know this person is not only a man,
1222720	1224640	he is the man.
1224640	1227000	YouTube's most regal makeup artist,
1227000	1228840	his lordship, John McClane,
1228840	1231160	and he uses he, him pronouns.
1231160	1233680	Likewise, if I were approached by this person,
1233680	1236800	I'd fall in love and then default to female pronouns.
1236800	1238600	And this time I'd be correct,
1238600	1241520	but not because she's a cis woman or a trans woman,
1241520	1244440	but because she's gender fluid drag queen, Courtney Act,
1244440	1245880	who has the fucking audacity
1245880	1247760	to be a more beautiful woman than I am,
1247760	1248960	and who, so far as I know,
1248960	1250880	uses male pronouns in boy mode
1250880	1253880	and female pronouns in girl mode, as do most queens.
1253880	1256280	A lot of the complexities of gender, language,
1256280	1259400	identity, and expression get played out in the world of drag.
1259400	1262320	Some queens, like RuPaul, just identify as cis men
1262320	1264520	who live as men and perform as women.
1264520	1267600	Others, like Courtney, Sasha Velour, Jinx Monsoon,
1267600	1271280	Shea Coulee, and Violet Tchotchke, identify as non-binary.
1271280	1273040	Others still are bio queens,
1273040	1275200	cis women who perform as drag queens,
1275880	1280000	and then there are trans women who are also drag queens,
1280000	1283640	like Peppermint, Imp Queen, or, for that matter, me.
1283640	1284600	I mean, look at me.
1284600	1285600	Do you think I dress like this
1285600	1287560	when I go to 7-Eleven at 2 a.m.?
1287560	1288600	Because I do.
1288600	1292400	Look what I've become, a bisexual, transsexual drag queen.
1292400	1294640	Look, I didn't intend to become this much of a snowflake.
1294640	1296720	I just, through pure coincidence,
1296720	1298080	happened to be the most interesting
1298080	1299480	and unique person who ever lived.
1299480	1301240	I am so sorry, I can't help it.
1301240	1302520	So let's recap.
1302520	1304040	There are gender non-conforming men
1304040	1305080	who present very femme,
1305080	1306480	but use male pronouns.
1306480	1308520	There are cis men who use female pronouns
1308520	1310120	whenever they present female.
1310120	1312440	There are gender-fluid people who use different pronouns
1312440	1314360	depending on their current presentation.
1314360	1316080	There are pre-transition trans people
1316080	1317520	who identify as a gender
1317520	1319400	other than the one they present and live as,
1319400	1320960	and prefer other pronouns.
1320960	1323880	So you really can't just rely on the way a person looks,
1323880	1325320	because there's a lot of situations
1325320	1327720	where the way they look doesn't tell you the whole story.
1327720	1331800	So, as you can see, identity definitely is important,
1331800	1334360	but it's also not the only thing that matters.
1335080	1337840	If trans identity were the only thing that mattered,
1337840	1339720	then there would be no need for a trans person
1339720	1341920	to come out or do anything to transition,
1341920	1344240	including requesting different pronouns,
1344240	1347200	because pronouns belong to the social world of language,
1347200	1349400	not to individual psychology.
1349400	1353120	This is an idea I tried to explore in my sexy furry video.
1353120	1355280	You can identify however you like,
1355280	1358480	but gender is also social, structural, and interpersonal.
1358480	1360840	So if, for example, you're a trans woman
1360840	1362320	still living as a man,
1362320	1363880	then you are fully trans,
1363880	1365040	your identity is fully valid,
1365080	1367720	but until you begin living as a woman,
1367720	1370760	your womanhood remains kind of hypothetical.
1370760	1372360	And when I say living as a woman,
1372360	1373960	I don't mean passing.
1373960	1376400	There's too much emphasis on physical appearance,
1376400	1378680	and not enough on social relationships.
1378680	1379760	You know, you don't become a woman
1379760	1381440	the first time you put on a dress.
1381440	1383000	You become a woman the first time
1383000	1385360	an older female relative turns to you at a restaurant
1385360	1387840	and says, maybe you should order the salad, sweetie.
1387840	1390280	My point is not to invalidate anyone's identity.
1390280	1391360	As far as I'm concerned,
1391360	1393400	if a trans person hasn't transitioned yet,
1393400	1394880	they are fully trans.
1395080	1397320	I'm just trying to be realistic about the fact
1397320	1399440	that a lot of people's gendered experience
1399440	1401960	isn't entirely a product of how they identify.
1401960	1402840	Put it this way,
1402840	1405520	I will always use female pronouns for a trans woman,
1405520	1408600	but my thought process behind it isn't always the same.
1408600	1411320	Many trans women just seem like women to me,
1411320	1414600	in literally the same way that cis women seem like women.
1414600	1416880	And I use female pronouns for them effortlessly,
1416880	1418560	just as I was trained to do from birth.
1418560	1421880	This, I think, is the goal for most binary trans people.
1421880	1424560	We want not necessarily to pass perfectly,
1425080	1427960	just to seem like our genders to the people around us.
1427960	1429480	As Laura Jane Grace put it,
1429480	1432240	you want them to see you like they see every other girl.
1432240	1434800	I want people calling me she not out of politeness
1434800	1437880	or respect for my identity as a trans woman,
1437880	1440280	but just because I seem like a woman to them.
1440280	1441960	Because the reality is,
1441960	1445120	not all trans women seem like a woman to me
1445120	1446640	in that visceral way,
1446640	1449160	and I live with this constant crushing anxiety
1449160	1451440	that I don't seem like a woman to other people.
1451440	1453920	I'm terrified of looking like a third-rate drag queen,
1453920	1455240	and I cope with that fear
1455240	1457400	by looking like a second-rate drag queen.
1457400	1460160	But look, even if a person is giving my eyes and ears
1460160	1463560	a 0% woman, if she tells me she's a trans woman,
1463560	1466520	I'm gonna use female pronouns no matter what she looks like.
1466520	1468480	Not just to be polite,
1468480	1470920	but also because I wanna recognize the reality
1470920	1472640	of her psychological experience,
1472640	1475800	and especially because I wanna help her re-socialize
1475800	1478360	and reintegrate into the world as her true gender.
1478360	1480080	And of course, cis people,
1480080	1483160	you legally have the freedom to refuse to do that,
1483920	1487120	but if you refuse, you are being a shit-gibbon.
1487120	1489680	And I would prefer that you not be a shit-gibbon.
1489680	1492960	Now, we need to address the genderqueer elephant in the room.
1492960	1494760	An increasing number of people identify
1494760	1497440	not as male or female, but as non-binary,
1497440	1500360	an umbrella term encompassing a bunch of more specific labels
1500360	1502920	such as genderqueer, genderfluid, agender,
1502920	1504520	graygender, and so on.
1504520	1506920	Many of these people use a non-binary pronoun.
1506920	1508800	In English, usually they.
1508800	1510120	Now, if your first impulse is to argue
1510120	1512400	that singular they is ungrammatical nonsense,
1512400	1515400	consider that having gendered singular third-person pronouns
1515400	1518440	at all is a particular feature of the English language
1518440	1520840	that's by no means shared by all other languages,
1520840	1523000	including Turkish, Korean, and Finnish,
1523000	1524280	which don't have them at all.
1524280	1525880	Language is just a bunch of fucking sounds
1525880	1526840	coming out of your mouth
1526840	1528840	that humans make up to suit our purposes.
1528840	1530440	If you're new to using singular they,
1530440	1532040	it is a little confusing at first,
1532040	1534360	but with some practice, it gets pretty easy.
1534360	1535840	They poured milk on me.
1535840	1537280	I poured milk on them.
1537280	1539080	They did anoint themself in their milk,
1539080	1540960	and it was good, thus saith the Lord.
1540960	1542360	So the polite thing to do here,
1542360	1544960	is easy, if someone asks you to call them they,
1544960	1546040	you call them they.
1546040	1547560	But if you're like me,
1547560	1549000	you don't wanna just do a thing
1549000	1552000	because you dogmatically believe it's the woke thing to do.
1552000	1554400	You wanna understand why you're doing it.
1554400	1557200	I don't just wanna tolerate non-binary people.
1557200	1558720	I want to be a convert.
1558720	1560280	I wanna believe about them
1560280	1561800	what they believe about themselves,
1561800	1563680	so long as those beliefs are reasonable.
1563680	1565440	So what do all these words mean?
1565440	1567080	What are these people talking about?
1567080	1569600	Remember earlier, we distinguished gender expression
1569600	1570720	from gender identity.
1570720	1572000	John McClane is feminine
1572000	1574400	in expression, but a man in identity.
1574400	1576560	Whereas I am a woman in identity,
1576560	1578640	and in expression, I am a mess.
1578640	1581080	Let us meditate upon one of lesbian culture's
1581080	1583840	great contributions to humanity, art, science,
1583840	1587520	spirituality, sexuality, metaphysics, the Futsch scale.
1587520	1590120	The Futsch scale is a diagram that looks like this
1590120	1592000	and quantifies from one to 10,
1592000	1593680	or high femme to stone butch,
1593680	1595760	the gender expression of a given domain,
1595760	1598840	such as Mulan looks or Steven Universe characters.
1598840	1601640	It can also be used more abstractly for weapons,
1602000	1603880	Pokemon, or wind instruments.
1603880	1606080	Maybe what non-binary people are trying to do
1606080	1609520	with words like genderqueer, agender, graygender, and so on
1609520	1612800	is to give to identity the same kind of specificity
1612800	1614720	the Futsch scale gives to expression.
1614720	1617520	But my input on this isn't really worth that much
1617520	1619040	because I'm not non-binary.
1619040	1619920	And to tell you the truth,
1619920	1621800	I kind of feel for cis people here
1621800	1624640	because all this talk about gender identity,
1624640	1627520	a lot of the time, I don't really get it either.
1627520	1629320	I look inside myself and ask,
1629320	1631400	do I feel like a man or a woman?
1632000	1633360	And over these years,
1633360	1636000	the answer is still that I feel like shit.
1636000	1637880	And that's how I experience gender.
1637880	1640240	I live, I exist as a woman,
1640240	1641640	which is the only way I can achieve
1641640	1644720	the same level of sadness and dysfunction as everyone else.
1644720	1647040	And I identify as trash.
1647040	1648640	I guess there are certain moments
1648640	1650400	that make me feel like a natural woman.
1650400	1652760	Oh, listening to Aretha Franklin,
1652760	1655160	the pain and ecstasy of penetration,
1655160	1657320	waiting in a long ass line for the restroom,
1657320	1659520	a big strong arm around my waist,
1659520	1661880	being asked if I have any tampons, having tampons,
1662000	1663560	in case someone asks,
1663560	1666000	a dude explaining philosophy 101 to me
1666000	1667920	and me going, oh really?
1667920	1669040	Wow.
1669040	1669880	But you know,
1669880	1672120	these experiences mean different things to different people.
1672120	1674040	So all I can really tell you is that
1674040	1678280	I prefer to express myself with diaphanous feminine gestures,
1678280	1679640	that taking female hormones
1679640	1681440	and having feminizing medical procedures
1681440	1683440	makes me feel more at home in my body,
1683440	1686000	and that I like it when other people treat me as a woman,
1686000	1688480	socially, spiritually, sexually.
1688480	1690680	So that's the jargon-free explanation of my gender
1690680	1691600	as I see it.
1692000	1693600	I don't even know what that would mean,
1693600	1695920	but I do know that the life I live as a woman
1695920	1697600	is the only life I have,
1697600	1700480	and that, I think, is legitimate enough.
1700480	1703240	So, I know what living as a woman means to me,
1703240	1705720	but what does it mean to live a non-binary life?
1705720	1708480	Well, just like what it means to be a man or a woman,
1708480	1709800	that's something that's gonna vary
1709800	1711800	between individuals and cultures.
1711800	1714120	Some cultures have ancient third gender traditions,
1714120	1716040	such as the Hydra of South Asia,
1716040	1718400	a local tribe that was born in the Middle East,
1718400	1720040	and some of them have a lot of history
1720040	1721440	that has been passed down for generations.
1721440	1723480	In Asia, a legally recognized gender
1723480	1726240	in India, Pakistan, Nepal, and Bangladesh
1726240	1727880	wore the various two-spirit traditions
1727880	1729920	of indigenous North American tribes.
1729920	1731520	Non-indigenous American culture
1731520	1733520	doesn't have a third gender tradition,
1733520	1736040	but we do have individual non-binary people,
1736040	1737600	some of whom are making content
1737600	1740040	that has taught me a lot about non-binary experience,
1740040	1742760	non-binary bodies, and non-binary life.
1742760	1744000	We have a lot in common,
1744000	1746080	binary and non-binary trans people.
1746080	1747960	Even as a binary trans person,
1747960	1749560	I used to live as one gender,
1749560	1751080	and now I live as another gender.
1751440	1753800	In itself is a pretty serious challenge
1753800	1755440	to the stability of the binary,
1755440	1757920	but many of the people who call themselves non-binary
1757920	1760160	seem to be fighting for something more radical
1760160	1761400	than what I'm fighting for,
1761400	1762880	at least in my personal life.
1762880	1764200	I'm just trying to assimilate
1764200	1766320	into a pre-existing female gender role.
1768080	1770440	As you can see by the normal way I'm dressed,
1770440	1772840	the traditional female garb of my culture.
1775960	1776800	No!
1776800	1778280	Whereas non-binary people
1778280	1780800	are trying to cast off these roles entirely,
1781440	1784440	trying to create the society that includes them.
1784440	1786480	And sometimes that puts me at cross-purposes
1786480	1789080	with some non-binary people who, for example,
1789080	1792200	promote the practice of always asking for someone's pronouns.
1792200	1794920	Whereas, I love it when people assume my gender,
1794920	1797160	provided they assume it correctly.
1797160	1798880	Otherwise, I will throw you
1798880	1801200	an imaginary Canadian pronoun jail.
1801200	1803400	But what we all agree on is that many trans,
1803400	1805680	non-binary, and gender non-conforming people
1805680	1808640	find it easier to navigate the world using pronouns
1808640	1811160	other than the ones that Ben Shapiro wants you to use.
1811440	1812840	If you want me to call you they,
1812840	1814080	I'm gonna call you they.
1814080	1817200	And though I cannot and will not force you, viewer,
1817200	1819000	to do or say anything,
1819000	1822280	I do hope you use your free will to freely choose
1822280	1825640	to use your freedom of speech to choose to do the same.
1825640	1826480	Freely.
1833640	1836880	Wow, at least there was a hideous monster this time.
1836880	1839000	I'm talking about the female lead.
1839000	1840480	Pfft, pfft.
1841440	1843200	The show's over.
1843200	1846200	I'm gonna go take my tits out at a funeral parlor.
1846200	1848960	So goodbye, my satanic subscribers.
1848960	1850200	Until next week,
1852280	1853520	go to hell.
1871440	1882280	Oh, oh, oh, this is who I am, yeah, oh.
1882280	1893280	We'll go hang in heaven, in heaven, in heaven.
1901440	1913840	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
