00:00.000 --> 00:11.240
Bring me another bottle of Moab, told you Antoine. Apparently the world is ending.

00:11.240 --> 00:13.520
But where is he?

00:13.520 --> 00:20.880
Sometimes I'm so goddamn beautiful it makes me want to throw up. Ugh, I'll get it myself.

00:30.000 --> 00:53.000
Antoine? There you are. Ugh, it's this nerd again.

00:53.000 --> 00:59.000
Hey, Doc. Can you bring me my smelling salts, please?

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
I'll think about it.

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Have you watched my video yet?

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
The one about the apocalypse?

01:04.000 --> 01:08.000
No, Marie. It's not about the apocalypse. It's about how to stop climate change.

01:08.000 --> 01:15.000
You goddamn liberals always want me to watch some video on YouTube where some boring transsexual lectures me about social justice.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.000
Well, I can't stand that.

01:16.000 --> 01:19.000
Well, why don't you watch a few minutes and then I'll bring you your smelling salts.

01:19.000 --> 01:24.000
This is extortion. You're singing to this just to shove your liberal agenda down my throat.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
My God. You cucks will stop at nothing.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
That's right. Open wide.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
No.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
No.

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
No.

01:36.000 --> 01:40.000
Welcome to the lab. The lab of aesthetic climatology.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
Is it hot in here or is the world just like this now?

01:43.000 --> 01:46.000
Imagine that this is the Earth.

01:46.000 --> 01:50.000
This is what the Earth would look like if you stabbed it with a giant knife.

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
In 1976, a beta cuck named Al Gore led the first congressional hearings on global warming.

01:55.000 --> 01:59.000
For the next several decades, he devoted much of his career to raising public awareness

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
about the grave predictions of climate science.

02:01.000 --> 02:06.000
In particular, the disastrous effects of global warming induced by industrial carbon dioxide emissions.

02:06.000 --> 02:12.000
Gore's activism culminated in 2006 with the release of his documentary An Inconvenient Truth.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
But a month before its release, Comedy Central aired an episode of South Park ridiculing Gore

02:17.000 --> 02:22.000
as a hysterical buffoon obsessed with warning the nation about a mythological creature called Man-Bear-Pig.

02:22.000 --> 02:27.000
It is half man, half bear, and half pig.

02:27.000 --> 02:31.000
The episode portrays Gore as a narcissistic attention-seeking alarmist,

02:31.000 --> 02:35.000
an issue-haver, a care-about, a sibilant moral f**k.

02:35.000 --> 02:38.000
I'm super serial, you guys.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
We all had a good laugh at Gore's foolishness.

02:44.000 --> 02:51.000
After all, no one likes a complainer, a critic, a moralist, a killjoy, a naysayer, a bearer of bad news.

02:51.000 --> 02:56.000
And in fact, a lot of us probably remember Man-Bear-Pig better than we remember An Inconvenient Truth.

02:57.000 --> 03:01.000
A lot of the backlash against Gore seems to fit a pattern described in the brilliant video essay

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
Why Are You So Angry? by Innuendo Studios.

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
Part two of the essay describes a phenomenon I'll call the Angry Jack Effect.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
It works like this.

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
You're at a barbecue shoving brisket into your front hole

03:12.000 --> 03:17.000
when you notice the person seated next to you declines to eat any meat because they're vegan.

03:17.000 --> 03:20.000
Your immediate instinctual reaction is anger at the vegan

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
because, even if they're not really judging you,

03:22.000 --> 03:27.000
the mere fact that they're a vegan means that they probably have reasons

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
for not eating meat.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.000
And that means there might be reasons why you shouldn't eat meat.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
So what you do is you lash out at the vegan and you tell them,

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Oh, so you think you're better than me, huh?

03:37.000 --> 03:42.000
Well, I'll have you know that eating meat is perfectly natural and, um, evolution

03:42.000 --> 03:46.000
and people who don't eat meat, well, their bones fall out.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
And besides, you're a hypocrite anyway

03:48.000 --> 03:53.000
because more animals die when they plow the fields for your stupid fucking vegetables, you moral jerk.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Of course, this is not really a rational response to the situation.

03:56.000 --> 04:00.000
This is you subconsciously protecting your ego from potential guilt,

04:00.000 --> 04:03.000
from the potential accusation that you're a bad person,

04:03.000 --> 04:08.000
and you're protecting the lifestyle that you enjoy and are accustomed to from a potential threat.

04:08.000 --> 04:12.000
And this is essentially how people have been reacting to Al Gore for decades.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
He's a fun ruiner criticizing our high-emission way of life,

04:15.000 --> 04:18.000
and instead of engaging sincerely with the critique,

04:18.000 --> 04:21.000
we lash out at him so we don't have to think about it.

04:21.000 --> 04:25.000
The problem is that, scientifically speaking, climate change is in fact real,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
and Gore was right all along.

04:30.000 --> 04:35.000
So now it's current year, and the global temperature has risen 1°C above the pre-industrial average,

04:35.000 --> 04:38.000
which is on track with the projections presented in Gore's film.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.000
Now, 1°C doesn't sound like much, but to get a sense of scale,

04:41.000 --> 04:47.000
consider that the last ice age was only 4.5°C cooler than the 20th century norm.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.000
We are already at 1°C warmer than the pre-industrial average,

04:50.000 --> 04:55.000
and current scientific models put us on track for 3°C warmer by the end of the century.

04:55.000 --> 05:00.000
An outcome that would, among other catastrophes, completely flood Shanghai and Miami.

05:00.000 --> 05:05.000
Scientists have long recommended that we limit warming to 2°C in order to avert global cataclysm.

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

05:08.000 --> 05:14.000
warns that even 2°C of warming could result in an iceless Arctic summer at least once a decade,

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
the destruction of nearly every coral reef,

05:16.000 --> 05:20.000
and a heightened frequency of tropical cyclones, droughts, and famines around the world.

05:20.000 --> 05:24.000
The report therefore recommends that we limit warming to 1.5°C,

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
a goal that requires drastic and unprecedented reduction in emissions within the next 12 years,

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
and net zero emissions by 2050.

05:31.000 --> 05:36.000
But even limiting warming to 2°C requires a significant reduction in emissions.

05:36.000 --> 05:41.000
Otherwise, we're on track for 3°C of warming, and possibly even 4°C or more,

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
a situation that could be near apocalyptic.

05:44.000 --> 05:49.000
Look, Doc, this is just the same liberal media bullshit we've all heard for decades.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Weather changes sometimes.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
You were just talking about the ice age.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
First it was cold, now it's getting warmer.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That's just nature.

05:56.000 --> 06:00.000
Do you honestly think that all the world's leading climate scientists

06:00.000 --> 06:05.000
just forgot to take into account that weather changes sometimes?

06:05.000 --> 06:08.000
Isn't it obvious to you that this whole guilt trip about carbon emissions

06:08.000 --> 06:10.000
is just an attack on the American way of life,

06:10.000 --> 06:14.000
another excuse for big government to take away my freedom?

06:14.000 --> 06:16.000
What freedom? Are you an oil company?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
Well, what if I sexually identify as an oil company?

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Isn't that what you liberals think?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
My identity is valid.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
No, it isn't.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
Bring me my smelling salts.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Watch the goddamn video.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.000
Imagine the year is 2100.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
I want you to picture the Earth as a human vagina,

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
and imagine you're a gynecologist,

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
and you're using a speculum to examine the inside of a watermelon.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.000
How does that make you feel, kids?

06:42.000 --> 06:47.000
I bet you wish your irresponsible, gas-guzzling parents had done something to stop this.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
So, we may have a global climate catastrophe fast approaching,

06:50.000 --> 06:55.000
but at least our political leaders are responsible, rational, and scientifically literate, right?

06:55.000 --> 06:57.000
Is there climate change yet?

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
Will it go back like this?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
I mean, will it change back?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
Probably, that's what I think.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
I believe it goes this way.

07:03.000 --> 07:07.000
Donald Trump has a consistent history of climate change denial,

07:07.000 --> 07:10.000
from his 2012 claim that global warming is a Chinese hoax

07:10.000 --> 07:12.000
aimed at undermining American manufacturing,

07:12.000 --> 07:15.000
to his tweet last week that it's very cold outside,

07:15.000 --> 07:17.000
therefore, whatever happened to global warming?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.000
Of course, the term global warming refers to

07:19.000 --> 07:22.000
the increase in the global average temperature,

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
temperature continuing to vary by region.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.000
In fact, global warming could cause some regions to become much colder,

07:27.000 --> 07:31.000
for instance, if the ocean current known as the Atlantic Conveyor Belt is disrupted,

07:31.000 --> 07:35.000
chilling the North Atlantic and potentially making European winters more severe.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
But Trump doesn't know or care about any of that.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.000
He's kind of the anti-Al Gore, you know?

07:40.000 --> 07:43.000
A real man, who takes what he wants by any means necessary,

07:43.000 --> 07:47.000
and won't be slowed down by any worries about what's factual,

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
or scientific, or true, or good,

07:49.000 --> 07:53.000
or consensual, or just, or safe, or legal, or even possible.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.000
He's the kind of man who Americans collectively want,

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
on some sub-rational, erotic level,

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
to brutally dominate us like an ancient Chinese god emperor.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Burn the scholars! Build the wall!

08:04.000 --> 08:07.000
But the problem, at least for those of you who don't actively enjoy

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
civilization's plunge into primeval darkness,

08:10.000 --> 08:13.000
is that the notion that there's any actual scientific controversy

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
about the role of carbon emissions in global warming is simply false.

08:17.000 --> 08:20.000
A 2013 analysis of the scientific literature on climate change

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
found that 97% of papers published on the subject

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
supported the conclusion that humans caused global warming,

08:26.000 --> 08:29.000
and the consensus has only increased over time.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.000
Climate change denial is considered an oddity in Europe,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
but is very common in America,

08:33.000 --> 08:38.000
largely as a result of a massive campaign of manufactured uncertainty and misinformation

08:38.000 --> 08:41.000
that goes back to the early 1990s,

08:41.000 --> 08:44.000
when the Western Fuels Association developed a strategy to

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
quote,

08:45.000 --> 08:48.000
They positioned global warming as theory, not fact,

08:48.000 --> 08:51.000
and spent half a million dollars researching the most effective way

08:51.000 --> 08:54.000
to promote that message via a propaganda campaign.

08:54.000 --> 08:58.000
Climate denialist talking points, promoted by organizations in the subsequent decades,

08:58.000 --> 09:02.000
have been statistically linked to funding from ExxonMobil and the Koch family,

09:02.000 --> 09:05.000
and denialism has been frequently pushed by Republican politicians,

09:05.000 --> 09:08.000
perhaps most vocally, Senator James Inhofe,

09:08.000 --> 09:11.000
whose campaigns are financed by oil and energy companies,

09:11.000 --> 09:14.000
and who's presented on the Senate floor such compelling arguments

09:14.000 --> 09:16.000
as throwing a snowball to own the libs.

09:19.000 --> 09:23.000
Denialist talking points have trickled down from the reptilian overlords

09:23.000 --> 09:25.000
to the ordinary YouTube comment goblins,

09:25.000 --> 09:28.000
where they provide ammunition for the angry jack effect.

09:28.000 --> 09:32.000
Just like Al Gore, or any messenger of inconvenient information,

09:32.000 --> 09:36.000
climate scientists themselves have for years been targets of endless harassment.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Michael Mann, the original publisher of the hockey stick graph,

09:39.000 --> 09:42.000
has received thousands of hate messages, death threats,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
even white powder in the mail.

09:44.000 --> 09:47.000
The mental health of many climate scientists is actually suffering

09:47.000 --> 09:51.000
as a result of harassment, denial, the bleak political situation,

09:51.000 --> 09:54.000
and the daily grind of studying a cataclysmic future.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
It's likely that this video will attract some deniers,

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
and I therefore invite my audience to use the denialist debunking resource

10:00.000 --> 10:03.000
listed in the top comment below to refute such claims as

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
there's still scientific controversy about the cause of climate change,

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
there isn't, what if the sun is getting hotter,

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
it's not, at least in the relevant timeframe,

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
and science is a liar sometimes.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.000
But even if you don't believe in science,

10:16.000 --> 10:19.000
maybe you'll find it convincing that even many oil companies,

10:19.000 --> 10:22.000
including ExxonMobil, now acknowledge climate change is real

10:22.000 --> 10:24.000
and caused by human activity.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
In fact, at the behest of oil companies,

10:26.000 --> 10:30.000
the state of Texas is now seeking at least $12 billion in public funds

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
to build a 60-mile spine of seawalls along the Gulf Coast,

10:33.000 --> 10:36.000
largely to protect oil refineries from rising tides

10:36.000 --> 10:38.000
and more severe tropical storms.

10:38.000 --> 10:42.000
After Hurricane Harvey, Texas lobbied Congress for $61 billion

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
to quote,

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
future-proof the state,

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
despite the fact that many of its top politicians

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
are public climate change deniers.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.000
You remember how it used to be called global warming?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
And then magically the theory changed to climate change?

10:54.000 --> 10:55.000
Sure.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.000
The reason is it wasn't warming.

10:56.000 --> 11:00.000
Do not listen to the cant of these sneering reptoids.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.000
The science is clear.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.000
Climate change is real and humans are causing it.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.000
If even ExxonMobil says it's real,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.000
it's probably real.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.000
There's really no point in digging in your heels

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
and refusing to look at the evidence

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
just because you don't want it to be true.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
None of us want it to be true.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.000
Okay, fine.

11:18.000 --> 11:21.000
So maybe the world is getting a teensy bit warmer.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.000
And maybe humans have something to do with it.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Now can you give me my smelling salts?

11:26.000 --> 11:27.000
Fine.

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Look, Doc, I gotta say,

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
maybe the scientists are right.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
Maybe it is happening.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
But to be honest with you,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.000
I'm having a hard time caring about this.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.000
Like, at all.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
How can you not care about this?

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
We're talking about the future of the planet.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Well, I don't care about the planet.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.000
I care about me.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
Well, don't you live on the planet?

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Mm-hmm.

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
And don't you care what happens to the planet you live on?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.000
No.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.000
God damn it.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
Watch the video.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
If you picture the Earth as a watermelon,

12:01.000 --> 12:02.000
you can see there's the outer shell here

12:02.000 --> 12:04.000
that traps the red flesh.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.000
And if you leave it out at midnight,

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
the stalkers...

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
The stalkers come for the red flesh.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
Before describing the details of our doom,

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
let's take a moment to review how we got where we are.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
The modern science of anthropogenic climate change

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
began in 1896,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.000
when a Swedish science jerk called Svante Arrhenius

12:21.000 --> 12:23.000
published a study titled

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Upon the Temperature of the Earth,

12:27.000 --> 12:30.000
in which he predicted that industrial carbon dioxide production

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
would eventually have a warming effect on the planet.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
By 1960, scientists had demonstrated

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
that the level of CO2 in the atmosphere

12:36.000 --> 12:38.000
was in fact rising,

12:38.000 --> 12:40.000
and President Buckin-Johnson's science advisory

12:40.000 --> 12:43.000
committee warned that industrial CO2 emissions

12:43.000 --> 12:45.000
could have a greenhouse warming effect.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.000
The Stanford Research Institute warned

12:47.000 --> 12:51.000
the American Petroleum Institute in 1968

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
that continued emissions would lead to Antarctic melting

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
and rising sea levels.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
But nothing was really done about it until 1988,

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
when NASA announced to the US Senate

13:00.000 --> 13:03.000
that the Earth was warmer than at any time in modern history,

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
that the warming could be attributed to human causes

13:05.000 --> 13:07.000
with 99% certainty,

13:07.000 --> 13:09.000
and that the warming was worsening heat waves,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
storms, and droughts.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
That same year, the IPCC was formed

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
to provide world leaders with a summary

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
of the science on climate change

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
and its political and economic impacts.

13:19.000 --> 13:22.000
So it started to seem like something was going to change.

13:22.000 --> 13:24.000
But by the early 1990s,

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
the oil and energy-funded climatology denial industry

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
was up and running in the United States,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
despite the fact that oil companies

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
had known climate change was happening for decades,

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
and Republican politicians became mouthpieces

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
for the so-called skeptic cause.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.000
Meanwhile, the Clinton administration

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
signed the Kyoto Protocol,

13:41.000 --> 13:44.000
pledging the United States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,

13:44.000 --> 13:47.000
a pledge that the Bush administration then refused to make good on.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.000
The 2012 Republican platform stated,

13:49.000 --> 13:51.000
against all scientific consensus, that

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
quote,

13:58.000 --> 14:00.000
Then, finally, in 2015,

14:00.000 --> 14:02.000
things seemed to be changing for the better.

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
195 nations, including China, India,

14:05.000 --> 14:07.000
and the United States under Obama,

14:07.000 --> 14:09.000
became parties to the Paris Agreement,

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
which established the goal of limiting

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
the increase in global temperature

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
to well below 2 degrees Celsius.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
By the very next year, Donald Trump

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
was elected President of the United States

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
on a platform of outright climate science denial.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Trump has since begun withdrawing

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
the United States from the Paris Agreement,

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
appointed a climate change denier

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
the head of the Environmental Protection Agency,

14:29.000 --> 14:31.000
and released his America First Energy Plan,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.000
which encourages unregulated burning of fossil fuels.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
So it's with a particular sense of doom

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
that we now receive the grim 2018 Iron Curtain.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
The world has already warmed 1 degree Celsius,

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
resulting in significant melting of both polar ice caps,

14:43.000 --> 14:45.000
increased average temperatures,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.000
increased extreme weather events,

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
and increased mosquito-borne illnesses

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
like malaria, dengue, and Zika.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.000
If drastic action is taken

14:53.000 --> 14:55.000
to reduce carbon emissions 49% by 2030,

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
and to net-zero carbon by 2050,

14:57.000 --> 14:59.000
global warming will still increase

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
resulting in a doubling of populations

15:03.000 --> 15:05.000
exposed to water and air pollution.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
The global warming will increase

15:07.000 --> 15:09.000
to 1.5 degrees above the pre-industrial average,

15:09.000 --> 15:11.000
reducing water scarcity and drought,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
and an estimated $10 trillion

15:13.000 --> 15:15.000
in annual flood damage losses from sea-level rise.

15:15.000 --> 15:17.000
But with the current political situation,

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
the goal of reducing warming to 1.5 degrees

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
is quickly slipping out of reach.

15:21.000 --> 15:23.000
By the end of this century,

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
we're likely to see at least 2 degrees of warming,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.000
which will lead to the eventual displacement

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
of 200 million people in coastal regions.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
3 degrees of warming will flood

15:31.000 --> 15:33.000
many of the world's major coastal cities,

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
including Shanghai, Miami,

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Osaka, Rio de Janeiro,

15:37.000 --> 15:39.000
Alexandria, and Hong Kong.

15:39.000 --> 15:41.000
4 degrees of warming will be close to the difference

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
between early 20th century temperatures

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
and the last ice age.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
A global crisis of hundreds of millions of refugees

15:47.000 --> 15:49.000
from island and coastal areas

15:49.000 --> 15:51.000
will be exacerbated by severe droughts

15:51.000 --> 15:53.000
and water scarcity,

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
trillions of dollars of damage to the economy,

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
famines, starvation, terrorism, and war.

15:57.000 --> 15:59.000
So it's not just the poor polar bears

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
and coral reefs.

16:01.000 --> 16:03.000
There are real human consequences to this.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.000
See? This is why you should care.

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
It's not just about the planet,

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
it's about the millions of people who are going to die,

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
and their homes.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Oh, jeez, wow.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.000
Gosh, that's really just too bad.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.000
What kind of response is that?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Look, Doc,

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
people die all the time.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
What am I supposed to do, cry about it?

16:23.000 --> 16:25.000
No, you're supposed to take political action.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
Yeah, I guess I

16:27.000 --> 16:29.000
could do

16:29.000 --> 16:31.000
that, but

16:31.000 --> 16:33.000
this bath is

16:33.000 --> 16:35.000
very relaxing.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Well, look, even if you only care

16:37.000 --> 16:39.000
about yourself, you do realize that

16:39.000 --> 16:41.000
when the coastal cities flood,

16:41.000 --> 16:43.000
we're going to have to take in tens of millions of refugees, right?

16:43.000 --> 16:45.000
Are you going to be okay with that?

16:45.000 --> 16:47.000
No.

16:47.000 --> 16:49.000
Well, then you'd better do something to reduce carbon emissions.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
No!

16:51.000 --> 16:53.000
Well, then you'd better be ready to take in a lot of refugees.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.000
No!

16:55.000 --> 16:57.000
You do realize, right, that in a hundred years,

16:57.000 --> 16:59.000
everyone is going to look back on people like you,

16:59.000 --> 17:01.000
and they're going to hate you so much

17:01.000 --> 17:03.000
for what you allowed to happen to this planet.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.000
Well, those are future people.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.000
I am alive now.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
And besides, if what you're saying is true,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.000
it's the apocalypse anyway, so why not just

17:11.000 --> 17:13.000
party and enjoy ourselves, right?

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
But it's not the apocalypse, though.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.000
Calling it the apocalypse is literally just another form

17:17.000 --> 17:19.000
of denialism, because we still have

17:19.000 --> 17:21.000
a little bit of time to fix the problem.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.000
Please, God, please,

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
just try to focus on solving the problem

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
while we still have time.

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
So, you're saying the world is ending. Cheers to that.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.000
The world is not ending.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
It's just getting shittier.

17:33.000 --> 17:35.000
Well, what am I supposed to do about it?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.000
Alright, let me just re-up here.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
.

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.000
.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.000
.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.000
.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.000
.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.000
.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.000
.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.000
.

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.000
.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.000
.

18:07.000 --> 18:11.000
.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.000
.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.000
.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.000
.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
.

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.000
.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.000
.

18:35.000 --> 18:37.000
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

19:04.000 --> 19:06.460
If you want to do your part to stop climate change,

19:06.460 --> 19:08.660
there are some lifestyle changes you can make.

19:08.660 --> 19:10.380
You can use LED light bulbs,

19:10.380 --> 19:12.680
you can drive a hybrid or electric car,

19:12.680 --> 19:14.500
you can use public transportation,

19:14.500 --> 19:16.500
you can try not to fly very often,

19:16.500 --> 19:17.800
you can eat less red meat.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.340
But the reality is, just 100 companies

19:20.340 --> 19:23.680
are responsible for 71% of global emissions,

19:23.680 --> 19:25.140
and the burden of stopping this

19:25.140 --> 19:27.780
can't really be placed on individual consumers.

19:27.780 --> 19:30.100
The companies themselves do not care.

19:30.100 --> 19:31.200
Left to their own devices,

19:31.200 --> 19:33.180
they will only pursue short-term profit.

19:33.180 --> 19:35.440
They will ask the government to build them sea walls

19:35.440 --> 19:37.660
while continuing to emit greenhouse gases.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.200
Climate change is exactly the kind of problem

19:40.200 --> 19:43.340
that capitalism is really ill-equipped to solve.

19:43.340 --> 19:45.100
The timeframe involved is short enough

19:45.100 --> 19:47.720
that scientists can predict total catastrophe

19:47.720 --> 19:49.160
in the foreseeable future,

19:49.160 --> 19:51.560
but just long enough not to enter into

19:51.560 --> 19:54.560
the shareholder-pleasing decision-making of corporations.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.320
So unless there's a drastic change

19:56.320 --> 19:57.740
in the next couple decades,

19:57.740 --> 20:01.180
this is going to be capitalism's great Chinese famine moment,

20:01.180 --> 20:03.160
only potentially, it'll be much, much worse.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.660
This is probably the most important issue

20:05.660 --> 20:07.780
facing humanity in the 21st century,

20:07.780 --> 20:10.640
so we kinda need to fix it by any means necessary,

20:10.640 --> 20:12.920
beginning with rapid political change.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.700
If that means direct action, it means direct action.

20:15.700 --> 20:18.020
For instance, organizing, participating in,

20:18.020 --> 20:20.320
or supporting a massive general strike.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.360
You also should demand that your politicians

20:22.360 --> 20:24.700
take a strong stance against climate change

20:24.700 --> 20:26.300
and the companies that cause it.

20:26.300 --> 20:29.880
And if you're American, vote this monumental ding-dong

20:29.880 --> 20:33.120
out of the Oval Office in 2020 before the entire planet

20:33.120 --> 20:35.280
shrinks and transforms into a corn cob.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.620
So let me get this straight.

20:41.620 --> 20:44.980
You want me to go vegan, drive a Prius, and vote Democrat.

20:44.980 --> 20:46.980
You're basically asking me to completely change

20:46.980 --> 20:49.680
who I am as a person and become everything I hate.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.240
Yeah, pretty much.

20:51.240 --> 20:52.980
But it's not about what I want.

20:52.980 --> 20:55.000
It's about what everyone has to do

20:55.000 --> 20:57.120
to preserve the survival of humanity.

20:57.120 --> 21:01.120
Well, electric cars, veganism.

21:01.120 --> 21:02.560
Who can even afford that shit?

21:03.120 --> 21:06.060
Well, you can't afford it if you drink less champagne.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.860
I shall do no such thing.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.440
Well, maybe you could drink Prosecco.

21:09.440 --> 21:13.380
I will not stoop to drinking Italian dishwater.

21:13.380 --> 21:15.180
You know, eating plant-based meals

21:15.180 --> 21:17.180
actually costs less than eating meat.

21:17.180 --> 21:22.180
Oh, okay, so just never again enjoy the morning aroma

21:22.340 --> 21:26.400
of bacon sizzling on the skillet, barbecued ribs,

21:26.400 --> 21:31.400
fried chicken, corn dogs, spicy pork belly, lamb chops,

21:31.400 --> 21:32.040
bloody steaks.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.040
