0	11400	Imagine how a woman feels. Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels. Imagine the
11400	17520	sweet smell of her perfume. Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against
17520	22600	yours. Imagine her letting you get on top of her and insert your p***s inside her,
22600	31660	softly moaning as it slides in. Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm p***s wrapped
31660	38180	around every inch of your c***. Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every
38180	44100	thrust. Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as
44100	51480	she possibly can and begging you to c*** inside her as you release every ounce of
51480	52580	your c***.
52600	60500	Then imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards and looking
60500	70840	beside you to see a person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate
70840	72940	way possible.
72940	81820	You will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in
81820	82580	your face are too small.
82580	83880	You will never get to experience this because you are not the proper shape.
83880	84880	You will never get to experience this because you are not the proper shape.
84880	85880	Have a nice day.
85880	86880	Hello boys.
86880	87880	Let's talk about bone structure.
87880	107460	There is something basically Soviet about the way the internet names things.
107460	110700	Stalin had portmanteaus like Agitprop, Politburo and Kompromat.
110700	111700	And we have Wevelet.
111700	112460	You know.
112460	116780	webinar, podcast, and incel, short for involuntary celibate.
116780	118980	The word incel was invented in the late 90s
118980	121320	by a lonely bisexual called Alana,
121320	122660	who created a website called
122660	125220	Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project
125220	126760	that was essentially a safe space
126760	129420	for people who just couldn't get it in.
129420	132040	But in our own miserable moment of internet history,
132040	135000	the word incel refers to a more specific community
135000	138220	of mostly heterosexual men centered around forums
138220	141180	like incel.me and r slash brain cells.
141180	143860	This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press
143860	145120	because for the last few years,
145120	146700	they've been churning out mass murderers
146700	149040	faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies.
149040	151080	But most incels aren't violent killers.
151080	153420	They're just men who've formed an identity
153420	154780	around not getting laid.
154780	156860	In this video, I don't want to mock incels
156860	159680	or lecture them or even sympathize with them.
159680	161700	I just want to understand who they are
161700	163120	and why they're like this.
163120	164840	To start with, sometimes the best way
164840	167700	to understand a person's world is to learn their language.
167700	170120	And the language of the incels,
170120	170960	well,
171180	172700	you'll see.
172700	175160	First base, incelese.
175160	177180	Does it ever bother you that the word women
177180	180620	makes adult females sound just a little bit too human?
180620	182540	Well, incels have a solution to that.
182540	185040	They've taken to calling women femoines.
187700	189240	The choice of vocabulary tells us
189240	190640	how incels think of women,
190640	192180	not as sisters or mothers
192180	193960	and certainly not as autonomous people,
193960	196580	but as a kind of foreign and scrutable object
196580	199440	comparable to a natural resource, an optenium,
199440	200820	to which incels believe all men
201180	202440	are entitled and to which they feel
202440	204140	they have been unjustly denied.
204140	205720	There's a long tradition of nerdy men
205720	209300	talking about women in nerdily misogynistic ways.
209300	211340	I'm reminded of famed rocket scientist
211340	214500	Werner von Braun's remark about female astronauts.
214500	218940	We are reserving 110 pounds of payload
218940	220940	for recreational equipment.
220940	222680	Which is not to say that alpha males
222680	224920	are less misogynistic than nerds,
224920	228380	but simply that nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny.
228380	231180	Now, femoid is about as neutral a term as incels have,
231180	233780	for women, and it's only downhill from there.
233780	237080	There's the usual standbys, bitches, sluts, whores,
237080	240400	all conveying a searing resentment of female sexuality,
240400	242400	the pinnacle of which is represented
242400	245260	by the bespoke incel coinage, roasty,
245260	246500	which I'm sorry to inform you,
246500	249100	refers to the incel belief that the human vulva
249100	251380	become mutilated through repeated penetration
251380	254200	by different men, though not through repeated penetration
254200	255800	by the same man, interestingly,
255800	258280	and thereby come to resemble roast beef.
258280	260700	Now, by definition, incels haven't actually observed
260700	263840	any vaginas, but to incels, anatomy is more a matter
263840	266520	of metaphysical speculation than crude science.
266520	268200	Though if you ask me, the right metaphor
268200	272020	for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour grapes.
274080	277680	Of course, not all femoids are created equal.
277680	279760	There are various subspecies.
279760	283980	The becky, or normie, femoid is to be contrasted
283980	287520	with the stacy, or sexually desirable femoid,
287520	290700	whose distinguishing features include makeup,
290700	292900	a slightly more masculine look,
292900	294400	a more masculine style of hair,
294400	296060	and a more Improvised look.
296060	299140	Stacy, on point, never works a day in her life.
299140	302820	Naturally curvy body gives men instant erections,
302820	306020	big tits and ass show fertility.
306020	308000	Leave my buns alone, you savages!
308000	310320	The stacy, naturally, has a male counterpart,
310320	312580	whom incels call the chad.
312580	317480	A chad is a hunky alpha whose hands are always prepared
317480	319840	to grab nearby fertile pussy.
319840	323100	He has a sloped forehead with a strong brow,
323640	328600	ram-bow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital plate.
328600	332740	It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad
332740	335720	exhibiteth a brow-ridge most pronounced,
336200	341040	whereas the skull of the Virgin is most inadequate in this regard,
341380	347940	predisposing such specimens to an abject existence of lamentation and cuckoldry.
347940	350020	It's time to talk about bone structure.
350300	351940	According to a classic incel meme,
351940	358780	The difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally a few millimeters of bone.
359320	361920	I would like to propose a sociological theory.
362380	363320	Farpington's Law.
363820	366680	Once bigotry or self-loathing permeate a given community,
367140	370220	it is only a matter of time before deep metaphysical significance
370220	373100	is assigned to the shape of human skulls.
373360	375060	Why skulls, you ask?
375340	377920	Well, the best explanation I can come up with
377920	381320	is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable.
381320	385360	It's therefore the perfect symbol of the intrinsic and permanent characteristics
385360	388400	that bigots like to assign to certain groups of people.
388760	392720	If you believe, for example, that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior,
393280	397540	you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape of a skull and saying,
397940	400100	Well, that's the reason why.
400320	401300	It's just nature.
401660	403280	There's nothing that can be done about it.
403480	407520	And that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy.
407920	410060	Mankind is divided into two groups of people.
410280	411940	The chads with the fuckable skulls
411940	415120	and the incels whose bones come up a few millimeters short.
416700	417860	Corndog, anyone?
418300	418940	I'm really hungry.
419900	422940	Of course, it's not just the skulls the incels blame for their sexlessness.
423340	427360	They have a whole dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of involuntary celibacy.
427620	430080	Height cells are inceled due to their inferior stature,
430080	434240	whereas mental cells can't attract women because of mental illness or autism,
434600	437160	or they're addicts and then called drug cells.
437920	442240	Wrist cells, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists.
442240	446020	Now, obsessing about your wrist size does seem a little weird.
446020	446520	Oh, yeah?
446520	451240	Is it a little weird that the average dildo has more girth than my wrist?
451240	455040	Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist?
455040	456580	But yeah, obviously,
456580	463160	obsessing about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even many women's is completely irrational body dysmorphia.
463160	467200	And the reason why no one wants to be with me or even talk to me is my shitty personality.
467200	467800	Even though,
467800	473300	literal 80 IQ men who have nothing to talk about except who won the game last night
473300	476000	are still able to attract a loving partner.
477680	478180	Interesting.
478180	480680	A significant number of incels are not white,
480680	483580	in which case their unfuckability is attributed to race,
483580	486460	and they are accordingly termed apologies in advance,
486460	487460	black cells,
488680	491180	rice cells, curry cells, and so on.
491180	493840	Which is not to say that all non-white men are celibate.
493840	497800	There are, of course, the occasional chads of color with their superior skills,
497800	499600	skulls, and towering stature,
499600	504840	whom the incels have christened Tyrones, Changs, and Chadpreets.
504840	506640	I'm so sorry.
506640	510640	So you can be incel because of your looks, your height, your mind, or your race,
510640	514960	but what unites them all is the conviction that love and sex are forever out of reach.
514960	518800	Unless, of course, you delusionally imagine that you can ascend,
518800	520920	that is, escape your inceldom.
520920	525380	If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any possibility of improvement,
525380	527680	well, that makes you the lowest of the low.
527680	530260	A sad and sorry hope-cel.
530980	533980	Second base, the red pill.
533980	536520	So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview,
536520	539980	the stacys, the chads, the incels, and the normies.
539980	545060	From these elements, incels have constructed a theory of human nature and sexuality,
545060	547140	which they call the red pill.
547140	550440	Incels share the red pill worldview with the rest of the manosphere,
550440	553380	that is, pick-up artists, men's rights activists,
553380	557060	and the voluntary celibate community known as Men Going Their Own Way,
557060	558440	abbreviated MGTOW.
558440	562100	According to red pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous.
562100	564760	Hypergamy, new Greek for marrying above,
564760	569180	refers to the practice of seeking relationships with men above one's social status,
569180	572760	and also, in incel usage, above one's attractiveness.
572760	578140	According to incels, physical attractiveness is naturally distributed equally between the sexes.
578140	583260	So, if you were to assign numerical ratings to attractiveness, as incels like to do,
583260	586360	there would be about as many, say, 8 out of 10 women, as 8 out of 10 men.
586360	594160	Incels believe that in a just world, a 5 out of 10 man would naturally wind up in a relationship with his looks match,
594160	598480	that is, a 5 out of 10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.
598480	602480	But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women,
602480	607160	who, regardless of their own attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad.
607160	609700	Incels sometimes call this the 80-20 rule,
609700	613980	the idea that only the top 20% of men will ever be desired by women.
613980	615900	Now, since most heterosexual men do end up being attracted to men,
615900	620140	you might be raising your eyebrow at that idea.
620140	622140	But incels have an explanation.
622140	628480	According to the red pill theory, women often pursue a mating strategy called alpha-fucks-beta-bucks.
628480	631900	This means that in her 20s, a woman will, as incels say,
631900	635700	ride the cock carousel, sleeping with as many chads as possible.
635700	640740	But as she ages into her 30s, she will settle down with a beta-normie whom she's not really attracted to,
640740	642900	but whom she will use for financial support,
642900	645700	all the while continuously cuckolding him on the alpha-cock carousel.
645900	650900	Before inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything he's worth in a divorce settlement,
650900	654600	and running off to the Mediterranean with all the children and a new chad boyfriend,
654600	659820	while the beta-cock is left behind to fester in alimony payments, solitude, and poverty.
659820	664060	So the upshot of the red pill theory is that for men, there are three possible outcomes.
664060	668060	Either you're an incel, doomed to a lifetime of excruciating loneliness and resentment,
668060	672240	or you're a normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife,
672240	675860	who will divorce you, win custody of the children, and run off with all your money.
675900	680980	Or you could be an alpha, an independent, promiscuous man,
680980	684660	who sleeps with lots of women and forms attachments to none of them.
684660	687780	In the red pill philosophy, there are two ways to become alpha.
687780	690480	The first is simply to be a chad by nature.
690480	692900	The second is to become a pickup artist.
692900	697400	Red-pilled pickup artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe,
697400	702200	that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable.
702200	704780	The difference is that pickup artists are not celibate.
704780	705900	In fact, they try to have sex with women.
705900	709400	They try to have sex with as many women as possible by following a series of strategies
709400	713920	and scripts known as game, as described by the book of that title, as well as by the
713920	719480	red-pilled pickup artist, Roosh V, author of a book called Bang, a new mascara from
719480	720480	Benefit.
720480	725940	So, the tube is bomb, I am living, let's see what the wand looks like.
725940	728080	Oh.
728080	729080	It's so big.
729080	730680	I wonder what Roosh is up to lately.
730680	732140	I bake my own bread.
732140	734780	Yes, I am outing myself as a baker.
734780	736540	As someone who likes to cook.
736540	737960	I'm not a woman.
737960	743980	I am ultra-masculine as you can see, but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing.
743980	745500	And men like scientific things.
745500	747960	I used to be a, a scientist.
747960	748960	Well, Roosh, you know what?
748960	753880	If it means you leave women alone, I hope you enjoy your new life as an ultra-masculine
753880	754880	baker.
754880	757780	Sorry, I mean bread scientist.
757780	762020	So remember, the red pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20%
762020	764020	or less of men are really attractive to women.
764020	768460	Dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism is a pretext for enabling women to behave
768460	772420	however they want while consigning men to emasculation and impotence.
772420	776260	The black pill is the additional realization that one's place in the sexual marketplace
776260	780620	is genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships are forever
780620	784180	out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible, and there's nothing one can
784180	786720	do except lie down and rot.
786720	791700	The black pill is essentially dogmatic hopelessness about dating, and about life in general.
791700	792920	It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call sexism.
792920	793920	It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call sexism.
794020	798660	It's called catastrophizing, a cognitive distortion where anxiety or depression leads
798660	803180	you to infer apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks and anxieties.
803180	806800	For instance, a catastrophizing person might begin with the thought, oh no, I'm gonna
806800	810580	be late for work, and from there infer, my boss is gonna be angry, I'm gonna lose
810580	814180	my job, I'm not gonna be able to get another job, I'm gonna be unemployed forever, my
814180	816640	family will starve, oh god, we're all gonna die.
816640	821640	Each step in this sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is
821640	822640	completely absurd.
822640	823640	This is exactly how the black pill works.
823640	827800	You start with experiences of rejection and isolation.
827800	831160	From there, you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never be attractive
831160	834920	to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy, that women
834920	838700	did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the social trends
838700	842180	that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and your only
842180	843680	option is to lie down and rot.
843680	847440	Of course, not all incels take things quite so far, but a lot of them do.
847440	852360	On incel forums, suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often tagged suafuel
852360	853360	or ropefuel.
853640	857220	This is what they make you want to kill yourself, usually because they're reminders of how hopeless
857220	861680	the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that incels are missing out on the incredible
861680	863400	bliss of sex and romance.
863400	868180	Now if you suggest to incels that posting suafuel on forums already populated by lonely
868180	873160	and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that oh it's
873160	877700	just dark humor, it's just a cope, throw us a bone here, but a lot of the suicidal stuff
877700	881980	shows no signs of humor, and it's common to see people express pretty extreme states of
881980	882800	depression, which is not surprising.
883640	887760	Since hopelessness is the logical conclusion of the black-pill worldview.
887760	892000	One's possibility for happiness is determined by the genetics of height, frame, and facial
892000	893000	bone structure.
893000	896740	And if you don't have these gifts, there's no relief but to cope or rope.
896740	899840	Now it's pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these kids.
899840	903940	You want to grab them by their black ops t-shirts, shake them a bit, and tell them there are
903940	907140	millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they're
907140	910600	their own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some
910600	913120	friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows?
913120	913620	Make some money.
913640	917400	Maybe they'll develop a disposition that women find a little more approachable.
917400	920740	Essentially, you want to tell them, clean your room, bucko.
920740	924500	In fact, for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of advice,
924500	927980	Jordan Peterson is probably helpful, because he's telling them a lot of what they need
927980	931960	to hear, and he's kind of a sexist old man, so they might actually listen.
931960	934680	But most incels don't want to hear this kind of advice.
934680	937400	In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression.
937400	942260	You are, in effect, chad-splaining their oppression to them, when you give basic advice like take
942260	943120	a shower, be more confident.
943120	948660	To people who've already experienced a lifetime of rejection and isolation, and who believe
948660	950260	they've already tried everything.
950260	955140	So they despise this kind of advice, and devote endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility
955140	956960	and insensitivity of it.
956960	958640	Just go out to parties, bro.
958640	962600	Instead of hating on women all day, why don't you losers just try being confident?
962600	964920	Like this average looking guy.
964920	965920	Confidence is key.
965920	967860	You incels need some hobbies.
967860	969440	Try reading some books.
969440	970440	Women love intelligence.
970440	972120	It works for me, bro.
972120	973120	Aw.
973120	974120	I need to get out.
974120	979880	No one knows what it's like to be hated.
979880	984340	To incels, their worldview seems ironclad, and has built-in defenses against anyone who
984340	986040	would try to change their minds.
986040	989880	So if you want to understand incels, and in particular, if you want to understand why
989880	994700	their community produces so many mass murderers, you have to understand that the black pill
994700	997560	is more than the dogma that you can't get laid.
997560	1001880	It's also the dogma that because you can't get laid, you can never be happy.
1001880	1002960	So what we have in our hands here is this.
1002960	1006140	It's not just a bunch of angry internet misogynists.
1006140	1011780	It's at worst a kind of death cult, complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy.
1011780	1016140	It is not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude that since
1016140	1020960	triumph is impossible, why not try revenge?
1020960	1022220	Third base.
1022220	1023220	Tinder is garbage.
1023220	1027620	I know I said I wasn't going to sympathize with incels, and I know they don't want my
1027620	1031960	sympathy anyway, and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil.
1031960	1034160	But on some level, I can't help it.
1034160	1038200	The internet is for introverts, so I'm sure a lot of people watching this feel the same
1038200	1039200	way.
1039200	1040380	I bet some of you have been this guy.
1040380	1042200	I have been this guy.
1042200	1045840	So look, I'm going to tell you something I've never really come out about on this channel,
1045840	1051480	so this is like a really vulnerable moment for me, but I used to live as a man.
1051480	1055560	And I'm not proud of that, but I'm ready to move on if you're ready to forgive.
1055560	1061240	I'm in the unusual situation of being a woman who dates men who used to be a man who dates women.
1061960	1063720	What kind of fucked up shit is that?
1063720	1065140	Is that even allowed?
1065140	1069020	Alright, cop down lesbian stans, I'm still attracted to women.
1069020	1070640	And those who lieth betwixt.
1070640	1071640	Cats.
1071640	1073640	The inherent eroticism of the sea.
1073640	1074640	Mmm, yeah.
1074640	1080320	Don't you just want to get in there?
1080320	1081320	Take me, mommy.
1081320	1083200	But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately.
1083200	1084780	I gotta get my hetero on.
1084780	1090200	What I'm getting at is I've used Tinder both as a man seeking women and as a woman seeking
1090200	1091200	men.
1091200	1093380	And that gives me some relevant experiences.
1093380	1097380	When you're a man, the strategy is you've gotta send a lot of messages, because women
1097380	1103000	get a lot of messages, and then you just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys.
1103000	1109220	Whereas if you're a woman, you get to lie recumbent on your chaise longue and receive
1109220	1110220	the inquiries.
1110220	1112440	Let's see how we're doing here.
1112440	1113760	How many men have liked me on Tinder?
1113760	1116880	I'm paying $30 for this information, so this better be good.
1116880	1118880	I have 2,500 likes.
1118880	1119880	That's a lot of Baltimore.
1119880	1120880	That's a lot of Baltimore.
1120880	1123900	That's a lot of Baltimore-ian men who swiped right on a tran.
1123900	1125900	What a divine city.
1125900	1133160	Oh, that's so nice of them to be interested in me.
1133160	1135100	Let's see what kind of messages I got.
1135100	1136440	Dick or no dick?
1136440	1138280	Pre-op or post-op?
1138280	1139700	Did you cut your dick off?
1139700	1141260	Oh my god.
1141260	1142880	I'm gonna cut it off, okay?
1142880	1143880	Jesus.
1143880	1149140	I will let you smash my pussy so, so hard if you just be patient.
1149140	1150140	It's a whole process.
1150880	1151880	That's not a pussy.
1151880	1152880	That's a fuckhole.
1152880	1155880	You'll never know what it's like to squeeze life out of your sacred passage.
1155880	1156880	Well, that's true.
1156880	1163940	I'm not gonna be squeezing any life out unless something goes very seriously wrong, and I
1163940	1168160	assure you that none of the passages I have down there have ever been or ever will be
1168160	1169160	sacred.
1169160	1171160	Abigail, leave my fuckhole out of this.
1171160	1174880	When I first started using this app, I was messaging with a guy who seemed super chill.
1174880	1175880	He was gonna take me to a concert.
1175880	1176880	I was like, it seems like a lot for a first date, but we'll try it.
1176880	1177880	He was like, you know what?
1177880	1178880	I don't know.
1178880	1179880	I don't know.
1179880	1181320	I'm gonna try it.
1181320	1184720	Fifteen minutes after we agreed to that, he sends me a message.
1184720	1187580	What color panties are you wearing?
1187580	1193100	I would love to smell them.
1193100	1194100	Can we get coffee first?
1194100	1198640	The hell of it is, I probably would've let him smell my panties, but this is the thing
1198640	1200020	you bring up on the third fuck.
1200020	1202000	You don't open with panty sniffing.
1202000	1205320	Like, the only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you're gonna murder
1205320	1206320	me.
1206320	1207320	And you're already fucking it up.
1207320	1208880	So this is the experience of women on Tinder.
1208880	1214700	we're drowning in dick and most of it is terrible not all i do have some very sweet messages and i
1214700	1218780	haven't been using the app in a couple months so if i didn't respond to you or if we didn't match
1218780	1225200	it's not because i rejected you it's because i don't like the app people screenshot my profile
1225200	1230560	and they post it online and they call me contra points and like i'm just too famous for this shit
1230560	1236380	my life is hard so girls we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad
1236380	1241220	dicks that's constantly pointed at us in dating apps but how would you feel if instead of that
1241220	1246320	you were just getting radio silence like the incels get i can't speak for other women but
1246320	1252880	personally i prefer the firing squad of dicks you know at least these pricks care enough about my
1252880	1258600	pussy to be an asshole about my dick i feel sorry for men on dating apps i really do you have to
1258600	1262620	deal with a lot of rejection and that must be difficult these apps are especially brutal to
1262620	1266360	people who aren't photogenic if you're meeting people at a bar or a party you might strike
1266360	1270300	up a conversation with someone who you're not initially physically attracted to but then
1270300	1274900	maybe they're super funny or charming or maybe they're attracted to me and that's an attractive
1274900	1280740	quality in another person that they appreciate how beautiful i am but on tinder you're just
1280740	1285980	browsing a catalog of faces and gatekeeping who even gets to talk to you in the first place
1285980	1290820	red pillars have a really gross way of talking about dating in terms of sexual market value
1290820	1296340	but like dating kind of is a marketplace or at least you can analyze it like one and our culture
1296340	1301720	is so visual and these apps are so picture centered that bone structure like it's not the
1301720	1306240	only thing that matters but it matters a great deal and this is where i do have sympathy for
1306240	1311600	the incels because as a trans woman i know what it's like to obsess over millimeters of bone
1311600	1316020	i actually had to interrupt work on this video to go to a consultation for facial feminization
1316020	1321100	surgery so i can pay luxury car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters of bone here and
1321100	1326120	there because it must needs be remarked that the skull of the female exhibited
1326340	1331060	a brow ridge less pronounced i mean i'm just as obsessed with bone structure as the goddamn
1331060	1335620	men cells because i think certain parts of my face make me look like a man and i worry about
1335620	1340580	it every day we're all obsessed with the bones honey we all have bones inside us we all love
1340580	1346980	touching bones you want to take a measurement from the supraorbital ridge to the lambdoid suture
1347620	1354660	and multiply that figure by pi to calculate what we call the chat circumference
1355700	1356200	why is no one talking to me?
1356340	1358180	why is no one talking about the chad circumference?
1358180	1364900	fourth base just the tip there's another way i think my experience as a trans woman is relevant
1364900	1369940	to the incel discussion and that's that i recognize delusional self-loathing when i see it
1369940	1374820	i'm far from the first to point out that the supreme gentleman incel mass murderer elliot
1374820	1380820	roger was apart from his narcissistic psychopath personality an eminently bangable twink i'm not
1380820	1385700	going to show you pictures of incels but on their forums they do sometimes post selfie threads
1385700	1392260	and you can't say this on incel forums without enraging them but in confidence from one pretend
1392260	1398420	clinician to another let me tell you that the truth about incels is that almost all of them
1398420	1403300	are completely normal looking guys but of course that's not the feedback they get from other incels
1403300	1406900	the feedback they get is that their chins are weak their hair is thin their skin is
1406900	1410740	garbage and there's no hope whatsoever no woman will ever love them and there are
1410740	1415540	true cells with no option but to lie down and rot and the interesting thing is those guys pose for
1415540	1421860	selfies to those threads knowing that's the kind of feedback they're gonna get so why why do they
1421860	1427780	do it well i'll tell you a little story there is a website on the internet called 4chan.org
1427780	1433780	that has a board called lgbt a few years ago this was used mainly by the 25 gay men who
1433780	1441460	actually like milo yiannopoulos but recently it's used mostly by men who are entertaining
1441460	1445380	the notion of becoming women and by early transition trans women
1445540	1451860	the board is jokingly called tttt now i've recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition
1451860	1458900	but the memory is still fresh and let me tell you it is a painful awkward humiliating stage of life
1458900	1464580	so the trans women of tttt are tragic they're basically still in man mode which is why they're
1464580	1470980	using 4chan and i bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels for incels the core
1470980	1475520	frustration is that they can't get laid for tttt it's that they can't get laid they can't get laid
1475540	1479620	they can't pass as female both groups post selfies knowing they're going to get brutal
1479620	1484100	unconstructive feedback and both groups have a weird vocabulary with which to express their
1484100	1491460	anxieties for instance on tttt a major piece of jargon is hun a slur used by trans women
1491460	1496100	for other trans women which basically means that you look like a man in a dress
1496100	1500580	which is what every trans woman is afraid of and there's another commonality with incels too
1500580	1504500	with all bigots and self-loathers which if you've been paying attention
1505060	1505460	you've already seen it
1505540	1506180	already guessed
1507060	1509940	you will never be seen as a woman because of your head size
1509940	1514500	have all the surgeries in the world your massive man noggin will stay the same
1514500	1520980	lel this freak thinks he has very soft facial features his head is huge lel
1520980	1525140	and the huns on reddit are hug boxing him and telling him that there are women with big heads
1525780	1531060	uh no there aren't there aren't women with heads that do that and ffs won't change you might
1531060	1535060	as well repress you transition with a man's head you will be clocked you will be looked at as a
1535060	1535460	freak
1536020	1537780	will never be seen as a woman
1537780	1538420	100%
1539220	1541220	this is why i'm not transitioning
1542100	1548660	thank you skull people for showing me the way and that no matter what i do i will always be
1548660	1554980	a manly man skull wise you saved me the embarrassment of being a literal
1554980	1556340	big-headed man in the dress
1556340	1563060	it is evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile be much more voluminous and the
1563060	1564540	facial plane wider be one with you at last rights do i hold a war Joanna uso what the real Amy wrote
1564540	1564980	was that fade worse visible I liked erasными man as a female. guten like that man wouldn't crack up.
1564980	1568260	It always comes back to the skulls. Every time.
1568260	1573140	The other interesting thing about TTTT is I used to get posted there a lot.
1573140	1577540	For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed me as inspiration.
1578180	1581220	Yikes. Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon.
1581220	1585380	If I'm not looked at as a big skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well,
1586740	1590980	that means that some of their transitions might go well too.
1590980	1596660	And that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing and hopelessness.
1596660	1600180	So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain why I didn't pass,
1600180	1603220	why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me
1603220	1604900	shouldn't even fucking think about it.
1604900	1607540	They shouldn't transition at all. They should just repress.
1607540	1609140	They should lie down and rot.
1609140	1610740	And I used to read this stuff all the time.
1610740	1613460	Like, I would specifically seek out threads about me.
1614020	1619540	Which might seem strange, considering I had hundreds of fans telling me I was a gorgeous
1619540	1620500	goddess every day.
1620500	1620980	So,
1620980	1622660	why did I turn away from that?
1622660	1627940	To intentionally seek out this dismal den of Huns talking about how my giant Hun skull is
1627940	1633380	clockable at a thousand paces and my voice sounds like a ridiculous Muppet falsetto hybrid
1633380	1635380	of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.
1635380	1639780	Well, basically there was part of my brain that just simply refused to believe it when
1639780	1641540	people told me I was gorgeous.
1641540	1644100	And for semi-plausible reasons.
1644100	1648260	A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous no matter
1648260	1649220	what they look like.
1649220	1650660	That's where the word Hun
1650660	1651460	comes from.
1651460	1652500	You look great, Hun.
1654260	1658900	So what TTTT is saying about Reddit hugboxing is true to some extent.
1658900	1664740	There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces.
1664740	1668260	So I came to regard all compliments as everyone is beautiful.
1668260	1669940	Politically correct cuckoldry.
1669940	1674740	And there would be this thrill of going to TTTT and reading other people saying what
1674740	1677540	my deepest anxieties told me was really true.
1677540	1680340	And that was always painful, but there was a kind of
1680340	1681540	pleasure, too.
1681540	1682660	There was a rush.
1682660	1683540	It's exciting.
1683540	1686820	To burst out of the politically correct bubble and say what you're really thinking.
1686820	1690340	That personality doesn't matter because big skulled chads get all the girls.
1690340	1694180	That ContraPoints is a big skulled Hun with a voice like nails on a shockboard.
1694180	1698500	And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I was just doing research.
1698500	1700740	I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying.
1700740	1702500	It's simply my job.
1702500	1704820	But soon I realized it wasn't just research.
1704820	1706900	And it was infecting me away from the computer.
1706900	1708980	This ridiculous vocabulary.
1708980	1709780	Huns.
1709780	1710820	AGP.
1710820	1713460	It was popping up in my head at unexpected times.
1713460	1715860	It was starting to color how I thought about myself.
1715860	1720020	And worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other trans women.
1720020	1723460	And that's the moment I realized, I need to stop looking at this stuff right now or
1723460	1724980	I'm going to become a monster.
1724980	1727700	And once that happens, it's going to be very difficult to fix.
1727700	1730100	This is exactly how the incel black pill works.
1730100	1732500	There's something infectious about these vocabularies.
1732500	1737220	Like on days I've been working on this video, I'll go out at night and these words just
1737220	1739460	involuntarily show up in my thoughts.
1739460	1741300	That bartender is such a chad.
1741300	1743380	He's totally hype-mocking that tiny cock.
1743380	1747300	And the tragic thing is, some incels don't realize what this is doing to their minds
1747300	1748500	until it's too late.
1748500	1749380	Let's face it.
1749380	1752260	Black pills are suey fuel.
1752260	1754580	And a lot of us can't handle them.
1754580	1759060	I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it since I loved uncovering
1759060	1761940	secrets that society had been hiding from me.
1761940	1767380	But it has affected my mental health in a bad way.
1767940	1768500	I made my
1768500	1774100	first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago, and I've never needed to do that before.
1774100	1779940	I could always talk myself out of it through logic, but my mind is ruined now.
1780660	1784500	This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm,
1784500	1788740	prototypically teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock puppet accounts.
1788740	1793380	But the more sophisticated adult version of this involves intentionally seeking out abusive and
1793380	1796340	disparaging comments about yourself made by other people.
1796340	1798340	I have a long history of doing this.
1798340	1800500	Intentionally looking for abusive comments.
1800500	1804820	Especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears.
1804820	1805700	Why?
1805700	1806900	I don't know.
1806900	1808660	Why do people cut themselves?
1808660	1812500	Part of it is what we could call masochistic epistemology.
1812500	1814260	Whatever hurts is true.
1814260	1816420	I've recently gotten much better about this.
1816420	1821220	I haven't been to any of the worse places in a couple months, and my mental health is
1821220	1822260	much improved.
1822260	1826500	So incels, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position
1826500	1827780	worthy of rational debate.
1827780	1828200	Because these are the same people who have been there for longer than I have done.
1828200	1828300	So, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position worthy of rational debate. Because these are the same people who have been there for longer than I have done.
1828300	1832580	ideas and arguments, you're not using them the way rational people use arguments. You're
1832580	1836620	using them as razorblades to abuse yourselves. And I know, because I've done the exact
1836620	1841980	same thing. The incel worldview is catastrophizing. It's an anxious death spiral. And the solution
1841980	1846700	to that has to be therapeutic, not logical. A lot of you are lonely. You've been bullied
1846700	1850780	and neglected. You feel left behind by society. But what you're doing when you're reading
1850780	1856300	incel forums is you're slowly internalizing a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves
1856300	1860400	and at other people in your situation, and at women, and you're forming mental habits
1860400	1863800	that are going to make it very difficult for you to live a happy life. So what you have
1863800	1868820	to do is get off those forums as fast as possible. I'm going to post a link in the description
1868820	1873800	of this video to instructions on how to block certain websites from your computer, because
1873800	1877540	for me, that's what it took.
1877540	1881380	Fifth base. Anal.
1881380	1886300	So the incel reddit transgender 4chan analogy has a limit, and that limit is that
1886300	1892460	for a significant subset of the incel community, their primary hatred is not directed at themselves,
1892460	1898460	but at women. And they really hate women. Like, I'm basically a professional internet bigotry
1898460	1902540	scholar at this point, I look at this kind of stuff all the time, but researching this video,
1902540	1907340	I was honestly kinda shocked at the intensity of misogyny on incel forums.
1907340	1910860	I won't show the worst of it, but we're talking blaming women for rape,
1910860	1915820	saying they deserve to be raped, calls for state mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but,
1916300	1920700	most of all, just a kind of generalized, misinformed rage.
1920700	1924380	I hate women. I really do.
1924380	1930540	Every time I look at them, my blood pressure shoots through the roof, when they're gabbing
1930540	1936700	on the cell phone about Paris Hilton, when they're adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time
1936700	1941340	rifling through their stupid purse, when they whine to me about their period,
1941340	1946220	when they blither on and on about some artist, film director, musician, nobody gives a-
1946300	1952300	flipping fuck about when they cry and expect your personal sympathy but most of all i hate them
1952300	1960380	because they're smug hyperactive little bitches made that way by our shithole society look what
1960380	1966060	uncontrolled feminism and the media has hi stacy it's tracy well i was at the mall the other day
1966060	1972460	with amber heather jenna and trish and we were talking about paris hilton a very relevant
1972460	1977260	cultural figure in 2018 they live in this cartoon caricature world where it's easy to avoid thinking
1977260	1981660	of women as fully human and that's where my sympathy runs dry because this kind of hatred
1981660	1986940	just needs a spark to turn to violence so insults i know you're not gonna listen to anything i say
1986940	1992140	and you're just gonna say that i'm a tranny and a faggot and a degenerate and to that i say how dare
1992140	1996620	you say things that are entirely true but also vol sell if you wouldn't and i know you don't
1996620	2001020	listen to suggestions about how you probably actually could have healthy relationships so
2001020	2002380	no one can really reach you until
2002460	2006620	you get out of those forums and allow yourselves to be reached but by way of a closing remark i
2006620	2011260	guess i simply invite you to consider that you don't even need a warm body or a sex robot to
2011260	2017500	satisfy the erotic longing you know when i was your age in 1975 every teenage boy had a stratocaster
2017500	2023500	in his bedroom it was the outlet for his sexual frustration what i'm suggesting is the manosphere
2023500	2028940	exists because rock and roll is dead but there's other options think about the eroticism of a
2028940	2032060	rainstorm the clap of thunder
2033180	2039100	the rustle of the leaves the steam rising off the warm pavement
2045660	2052460	and whether you're a chad a stacy an incel or a hun you can always return to the caress of
2052460	2062060	our dark mother the sea whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body
2062460	2088800	as a
2088800	2089560	of
2089560	2090460	my
2090460	2091260	own
2091260	2092280	work
2092460	2103400	Whew, is it hot in here or is it just me?
