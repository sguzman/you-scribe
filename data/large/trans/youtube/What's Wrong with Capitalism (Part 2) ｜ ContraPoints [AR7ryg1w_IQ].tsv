0	2000	I
15000	19920	Like stuff I like this and I like this and I like this I
19920	29720	Like stuff and I want more stuff
30920	37780	My child hearken to my voice. It is I Socrates. Oh, no. What do you want?
37780	40360	I haven't seen you at the symposium of late
40760	46680	Well, yeah, because you kind of hate women and it was getting me down my child without my guidance
46680	48680	You have become a slave to mere appetite
48680	55820	Have you forgotten what I've taught you about the true meaning of happiness the rational contemplation of truth and justice?
56300	60140	Look, I tried that and honestly, I don't think it's really my thing
60300	66260	I'm a dum-dum and I like shiny things. Ah, but my child these are pleasures for the pigs
66940	70700	Happiness can only be acquired through the contemplation of beauty itself
71440	75080	Perfectly exemplified in the supple bodies of young boys
75920	78640	Okay, thank you for your feedback. We'll take that away
78680	84260	I'm just a dum-dum who likes shiny things and these are questions really better left to the philosophers
84260	87380	Which is why I'm not going to present my original ideas in this video
87380	92300	Instead, I will be interpreting one of the most influential works of anti-capitalist philosophy ever produced
92300	98300	A series in multiple volumes that examines deeply the importance of the idea of happiness
98300	100300	And I hope you enjoy it
100300	102300	And I hope you enjoy it
102300	104300	And I hope you enjoy it
104300	106300	And I hope you enjoy it
106300	108300	And I hope you enjoy it
108680	110680	And I hope you enjoy it
110680	112680	And I hope you enjoy it
112680	114680	And I hope you enjoy it
114680	116680	I'll see you in the next video
138680	143640	and a $1 ice cream to a $1,000 ice cream that's made of gold,
143640	147880	and a $1 bagel to a $1,000 bagel that's made of gold.
147880	149000	It is a lot of gold.
149000	150680	What do I do with the gold on my fingers?
150680	151800	A gongipreneur!
151800	156440	Now to the untrained eye, Worth It may seem like insipid YouTube click fodder.
156440	161560	But we intellectuals, well, we have a taste for insights that penetrate a little deeper.
161560	163800	We like to take it all in.
163800	164520	Ah!
164520	170440	The Worth It boys, Andrew, Adam, Steven, these are not mere content creators,
170440	174360	mere actors, dancing monkeys performing for ad revenue.
174360	179640	They're philosophers, spiritual leaders even, and what they've accomplished on YouTube,
179640	184200	quite honestly, far surpasses the combined insights of Marx, Engels,
184200	189560	Lenin, Sartre, Trotsky, Luxembourg, Gramsci, Luk√°cs, Zarathustra,
189560	192120	and even our dear bread mom, Kropotkin.
192120	194120	I've of course read each of these great thinkers
194120	194520	completely.
194520	196360	It works many, many times.
196360	200760	But I always come away dissatisfied, and I find myself returning, yet again,
200760	204360	to the unparalleled masterworks of Andrew, Adam, and Steve.
204360	209000	See, each episode of Worth It poses to the viewer a fundamental question.
209000	210680	Is it worth it?
210680	211800	We may never know.
211800	216920	Take, for instance, the case of the $2 pizza versus the $2,000 gold pizza.
216920	218680	Which is the better deal?
218680	222440	I mean, how would we even begin to answer such a perplexing riddle?
222440	224120	Well, according to Karl Marx,
224120	227320	the value of a commodity must be understood in two ways.
227320	233000	On the one hand, there's the use value, the commodity's capacity to satisfy some human need.
233000	236040	And on the other hand, there is the exchange value,
236040	240760	the quantity determining the ratio by which a commodity is exchangeable with every other
240760	246360	commodity, deriving from objectified labor over time and expressed in terms of price.
246360	248360	But let's not oversimplify things.
248360	253960	Clearly, Andrew, Adam, and Steve are inviting us, the viewers of Worth It, to understand,
253960	259640	the use-value-exchange-value dichotomy, not as a mere hierarchical binary,
259640	264680	but as a sort of Deleuzian rhizome, a non-arborescent multiplicity,
264680	269000	with as many sinuous interconnections as the truffles on the pizza itself.
269000	270600	Am I making myself clear?
270600	271160	I'm not.
271160	274840	It's almost as if the philosophers are simply burdening me with jargon
274840	277160	and not actually helping me think through this any better.
277160	282120	So, let's throw philosophy in the trash and start over from the beginning.
282120	283080	Fuck this!
283960	293640	I like stuff.
293640	295160	And I like shiny things.
295160	297240	Now, that's something everyone can understand,
297240	302360	so let's take that as the first axiom of the economic theory I'll be developing in this video.
302360	306040	So, given that I like stuff and I like shiny things,
306040	307480	let's return to the question.
307480	310120	Is a $2,000 pizza worth it?
310120	313640	Well, it is covered in gold, and gold is shiny,
313640	315000	so I do like that.
315000	318440	But the pizza itself seems kinda gross.
318440	321320	It's got squid ink dough smeared with foie gras,
321320	325400	stilton cheese, black truffles, gold flakes, and caviar.
325400	328920	These flavors are overwhelming and they don't make any sense together.
328920	332200	The only thing they have in common is being really expensive.
332200	335560	It's like the culinary equivalent of Donald Trump's apartment.
335560	340040	But Andrew and Steven sit there with New York's financial district for a backdrop,
340040	343320	and they try to pretend that the pizza doesn't taste like golden shit.
343640	348840	I'm honestly speechless.
348840	349720	I feel weird.
349720	350520	Is it the gold?
350520	352200	I just ate $250.
353000	355000	I feel kinda like I'm committing a crime.
355000	358680	And that's what $1,250 looks like.
359320	364600	There's this kind of sadness that sets in as they realize that the $2,000 pizza
364600	369320	isn't worth it at all, and they start to feel almost like they've done something immoral.
369320	373080	It's a feeling I've had many times myself after spending too much money
373080	377720	on some gilded piece of trash in a vain attempt to fill the hollow in my soul.
377720	379560	Is there a name for that feeling?
379560	383080	Well, I like to call it fucking neoliberalism.
383080	386280	In a post-scarcity luxury communist utopia,
386280	390600	a bad pizza covered in gold would just be a bad pizza covered in gold.
390600	393880	You might be mad at the chef for making a disappointing pizza,
393880	397960	but you probably wouldn't be overcome with feelings of emptiness and guilt.
397960	401800	To fully understand why a $2,000 pizza is not worth it,
401800	402280	you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.
402280	402520	You have to understand it in a way that is not worth it, and you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.
402520	403080	You have to understand it in a way that is not worth it, and you have to understand it in a way that is not worth it.
403080	404920	in the context of capitalism.
404920	409320	The price, $2,000, tells you the exchange value of the pizza,
409320	413320	and if you live in America, you have an instinctive sense for what that means,
413320	416680	because you know all the other things you could buy with $2,000.
416680	422360	For a lot of people, $2,000 would buy a few months of food, or health care, or golden nails.
422360	425720	And there's a lot of families who sit around the kitchen table every evening
425720	428520	worrying about how they're going to afford golden nails.
428520	432280	And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem
432280	432680	And it's that awareness that makes the shitty $2,000 pizza seem
432680	437400	not just aesthetically disappointing, but almost obscene, or even immoral.
437400	441640	But of course to call it immoral is actually to misidentify the real problem.
441640	444280	So it's not like those shitty YouTube comments that go
444280	448040	Pizzas in Africa could have eaten those children, how dare you!
448040	451480	Because the problem isn't that Andrew, Adam, and Steven are bad people
451480	455000	for buying an expensive flatbread smeared with gilded cream cheese.
455000	459080	The problem is our economy fundamentally operates in a way that makes inevitable
459080	462600	these repulsive juxtapositions of scarcity and abundance.
462600	465800	That's why I don't really agree with a philosopher, Peter Singer,
465800	469240	who has this idea that many of the world's problems could be solved
469240	473160	if privileged American college students would just become hedge fund managers
473160	476680	and donate most of their income to buying mosquito nets in the Congo.
476680	479640	I mean sure, that would probably help with certain situations,
479640	483560	but it's not going to change the fact that the global economy is structured around
483560	487880	cheap, exploited labor at the bottom, and $2,000 pizzas at the top.
487880	492520	Another way to approach this issue might be to ask, who are the goddamn reptiles?
492600	494920	Well, they're certainly not the Jews.
494920	499960	I want to be clear, get everyone on the same page, that I'm not blaming the Jews for anything.
500840	503480	Except, you know, cucking the white race.
503480	505720	But to be fair, someone had to cuck them.
505720	507960	The white race has really been getting on my nerves lately.
507960	509640	So the lizards are not the Jews.
509640	511960	They're not reptilians from Alpha Draconis.
511960	515080	They're not freemasons or globalists or the gay agenda.
515080	519000	But the key insight is that they're not even really the capitalists.
519000	521640	The lizards are capital itself.
521640	522120	And what are they?
522120	522360	They're the capitalists.
522360	522440	They're the capitalists.
522440	522520	They're the capitalists.
522520	522580	They're the capitalists.
522580	522600	They're the capitalists.
522600	523480	What does that mean?
523480	524600	Well, I don't know.
524600	527320	But it does make me sound like I've read a lot of Marx, doesn't it?
527320	530760	What I'm trying to say is that the problems with our economy are not just the product
530760	534040	of greed or some other personal moral defect of the wealthy.
534040	537160	Of course, some capitalists are terrible people.
537160	538680	But some probably aren't.
538680	542920	And either way, the virtues or vices of the rich are sort of beside the point.
542920	547320	So the real point of the golden pizza is that it's emblematic of the fact that the extreme
547320	551640	economic inequalities of our society are laughably unjustifiable.
551640	552440	If I were to translate this into English, I would say that the golden pizza is the
552440	552680	golden pizza.
552680	555480	If I were to translate the meaning of the golden pizza into an argument, it would go
555480	556600	something like this.
556600	561560	Capitalism as we know it is a defective economic system because, although it's good at creating
561560	566120	large amounts of wealth, it distributes that wealth in an incredibly inefficient way, where
566120	571320	efficiency is understood not as the capacity to maximize total wealth, but as the capacity
571320	573000	to maximize human happiness.
573000	575160	Now I need to explain what I mean about happiness.
575160	576040	Here's a question.
576040	579800	Should the economy serve humanity, or should humanity serve the economy?
579800	582420	It seems obvious to me that the economy should serve the economy.
582420	583300	It should serve humanity.
583300	587700	So what I look for in a good economic system is that it produces the most happiness for
587700	589060	the people who are a part of it.
589060	592820	So if you're willing to go along with this, the first question we should ask is, does
592820	595060	having more wealth make people happier?
595060	599540	And we actually have data about that, at least within the context of our own economic system.
599540	604260	And the data shows that more income does lead to more happiness, up to a certain point.
604260	610180	But the happiness benefit of increased income plateaus somewhere between $65,000 and $95,000
610180	610660	a year.
610660	610740	That's a lot of money.
610740	610820	That's a lot of money.
610820	610900	That's a lot of money.
610900	610980	That's a lot of money.
610980	611060	That's a lot of money.
611060	611300	That's a lot of money.
611300	611540	That's a lot of money.
611540	611620	That's a lot of money.
611620	611700	That's a lot of money.
611700	611780	That's a lot of money.
611780	616020	And the reason why happiness increases up to the threshold is that at lower income
616020	621380	levels, more income means less stress about paying rent, or mortgages, or medical bills,
621380	622500	or college tuition.
622500	627380	But once you pass the threshold, more income basically just translates into more disappointing
627380	628500	golden pizzas.
628500	633940	If that interpretation is correct, then the current income distribution seems really irrational,
633940	636260	at least if the goal is to maximize happiness.
636260	640900	The income distribution in the United States is skewed toward the upper extreme, so that
640900	646740	the national mean income is around $72,000, right in the plateau zone, but the national
646740	651060	median income is around $59,000, significantly below it.
651060	658180	Furthermore, 1% of the population are making more than $389,000 a year, several times the
658180	659700	peak happiness threshold.
659700	664980	So at least to my naive eyes, what it looks like is that millions of people in this country
664980	670260	don't have enough money to securely afford food, housing, education, and healthcare,
670260	675460	while a few million others are, like, constantly gorging themselves on golden pizzas or something.
675460	677780	But I'm guessing it's even worse than that.
677780	681780	Because it's not just that some people don't have enough money to meet all of their needs,
681780	685700	it's that they have to be poor while other people are rich.
685700	690580	And since people compare themselves to others, that leads to all kinds of additional anxieties
690580	692740	and resentments and social tensions.
692740	697060	There's a study of capuchin monkeys that shows if you reward one monkey for a task
697060	700100	with a delicious grape, and a monkey in the adjacent cage
700100	704100	with a shitty cucumber, the monkey who gets the cucumber loses his shit.
704100	708180	And if you do this to humans for long enough, they start building guillotines.
708180	710020	But that's just how it looks to me.
710020	710900	I could be wrong.
710900	716100	I mean, I'm not an economic theorist, and honestly, I don't really understand how the
716100	717060	economy works.
717060	719940	I don't even check my own bank account balance very often.
719940	722660	I make the videos, I swipe the card.
722660	727780	So look, if I'm wrong and capitalism is good, actually, just leave a comment and I'll be
727780	729140	happy to be proven wrong.
729140	729940	But before you do that, I want to thank you for watching this video.
729940	730020	I hope you enjoyed it, and I'll see you in the next one.
730020	730080	Bye!
730100	733220	But let's get some of the more obvious objections out of the way.
733220	737220	Income inequality exists because not everyone does the same jobs.
737220	741300	Some people work harder than others, and those people deserve to make more money.
741300	745940	Well, sweatshop workers work really hard, and they barely make any money at all.
745940	749940	And a lot of people who work minimum wage have to work multiple jobs just to sustain
749940	751300	themselves and their families.
751300	754980	It's actually a ton of work, and they barely make enough money to survive.
754980	757620	But minimum wage workers are unskilled workers.
757620	759940	Why would anyone become an innovator or medical
759940	762660	researcher if they could make a good living as a janitor?
762660	766420	Well, janitorial work is pretty important, actually.
766420	770740	Someone has to cook and clean, and I think people who do such necessary work deserve
770740	771540	a decent living.
771540	775620	But I also think a lot of people would find janitorial work boring, and I think that the
775620	780740	kind of personality that likes to innovate and invent often isn't driven mainly by profit
780740	781300	anyway.
781300	785460	Jonas Salk never patented his polio vaccine, even though he could have made millions of
785460	789860	dollars from it, because he just cared about humanity, and he was driven by a purpose,
789860	791460	beyond personal profit.
791460	796180	In fact, a lot of great historical scientists were upper-class people who didn't need to
796180	800660	work for a living at all, and were just driven by their own passion and curiosity.
800660	802180	So let me get this straight.
802180	806980	You criticise capitalism, and yet you yourself make money on the internet.
806980	808100	Hypocrite much?
808100	813140	A few years ago, I was a broke philosophy graduate student, and when I criticised capitalism
813140	814740	then, people used to say,
814740	817940	Why don't you stop whining and get a real job and earn a living?
817940	819620	You just resent capitalism because you don't have enough money to make a living.
819620	819780	You don't have enough money to make a living.
819780	819860	You don't have enough money to make a living.
819860	822500	You're too lazy to put in the work it takes to succeed.
822500	827300	So if people who are failing under capitalism can't criticise it because they're just resentful,
827300	831700	and people who are succeeding under capitalism can't criticise it because they're hypocrites,
831700	836340	then, according to you, is anyone allowed to criticise capitalism?
836340	840820	Capitalism may have problems, but it's the best economic system there is.
840820	844260	You wouldn't want to live in Soviet Russia or Maoist China, would you?
844260	845540	Well, no, I wouldn't.
846420	847460	Hello.
847460	849140	I'm Tatyana Tankikova.
849140	849780	I'm here to...
849780	851300	I'm here to defend Stalin.
851300	851940	Fuck off!
852740	854340	Do svidaniya, fascist.
854340	856020	Do svidaniya, fascist.
856020	859540	So, granted, a lot of past communist regimes were shitty.
859540	863380	But that doesn't mean that the current system is the best and final system for all time.
863380	868180	My approach to this topic is not to try to resurrect Soviet communism or anything like that,
868180	873620	but rather to identify problems with the current system that seem to cause unhappiness and instability.
873620	876660	Okay, but I like stuff.
876660	878180	I like stuff too.
878180	879700	I think a lot of people have this instinct,
879700	883620	this instinctive fear that if capitalism goes, so does everything we love.
883620	887540	I mean, when I think of communism in particular, I think of austerity,
887540	894420	scarcity, conformity, undrinkable victory gin, the end of fashion, all art required to be propaganda,
894420	897860	just an all-around nightmare situation for a person of my persuasion.
897860	900980	And it's not for no reason at all that I have these anxieties,
900980	904500	since there was an aspect of that to some past communist societies.
904500	909540	But the stuff I'm worried about ‚Äî booze, makeup, art, baths ‚Äî these things existed,
909540	912580	long before capitalism, and they'll exist long after it.
912580	915860	And I know different types of people will have different things they're concerned about.
915860	916900	Straight guys will be like,
916900	920020	Will there be video games after capitalism? Oh god!
920020	921380	And yeah, there will be.
921380	924660	Tetris is a Soviet game, and it's one of the best games of the 80s.
929140	931780	Some of the stuff we like could probably even be improved,
931780	934100	if it were liberated from capitalist pressures.
934100	937940	I mean, look what capitalism and the pressure to turn a profit has done to movies.
937940	939340	The last time I was reading the,
939340	942740	only book I've ever read, Ways of Seeing by John Berger,
942740	946580	I noticed this description of glamour in the context of advertising.
946580	949700	Its promise is not of pleasure, but of happiness.
949700	952820	Happiness as judged from the outside by others.
952820	956180	The happiness of being envied is glamour.
956180	960180	And I felt kind of attacked, because glamour is very important to us.
960180	961940	And by us, I mean the gays.
961940	967460	The Ls, the Gs, the Bs, the Ts, and all those filthy, filthy Qs.
967460	968980	But isn't it kind of true that,
968980	970460	at least in advertising,
970460	975260	the function of glamour is to provoke feelings of envy and inadequacy in the beholder,
975260	976860	in the service of selling you shit?
976860	980460	But the advertising function, I think, is an appropriation of glamour,
980460	981900	not something essential to it.
981900	984300	And maybe, glamour would actually be liberated
984300	986700	if it weren't constantly conflated with advertising.
986700	989820	So I guess my message to socialists of the world is that,
989820	991580	actually, stuff is good.
991580	992540	Glamour is good.
992540	993740	Video games are good.
993740	994780	Luxury is good.
994780	995820	Baths are good.
995820	998940	I mean, even gold is good if you don't abuse it
998980	999620	horribly.
999620	1002100	You know, the most offensive thing about the golden pizza
1002100	1005740	is ultimately that the two dollar pizza is actually better.
1005740	1007300	The golden pizza is an affront,
1007300	1010260	not just to the people whose medical bills it could have paid,
1010260	1013060	but it's an affront to gustatory pleasure itself.
1013060	1015260	So I guess my final take here is,
1015260	1017900	actually, champagne socialism is good.
1017900	1020820	But I'm not talking about the champagne classes becoming socialist.
1020820	1023860	I'm talking about redistributing the goddamn champagne.
1023860	1024660	All right.
1024660	1026700	Now that I've gotten these objections out of the way,
1026700	1028340	I'm finally ready to get started.
1028980	1030620	Which you've all been waiting for.
1030620	1033060	How to end capitalism once and for all.
1033060	1034660	Well, I don't know.
1034660	1036060	Who do you people think I am?
1036060	1038260	I'm a socially conscious YouTube entertainer,
1038260	1040180	not transsexual Gandhi.
1040180	1041380	I mean, according to Marxism,
1041380	1044020	we can't just start the revolution whenever we feel like it.
1044020	1045540	Capitalism has to fail,
1045540	1048540	and that'll bring about the conditions that make revolution inevitable.
1048540	1052180	So I guess we just try to relax and wait for that to happen.
1054020	1056020	I'm sure it's bound to happen any day now.
1058980	1064220	You know, maybe we should do something in the meantime.
1064220	1065740	Uh, so, I don't know.
1065740	1068180	I guess vote Labour.
1068180	1069780	Tweet radically.
1069780	1072540	Try to eat more vegetables.
1072540	1077500	Try not to be manipulated into waging war against other downtrodden people.
1077500	1083300	And can we please not hand more power to the absolute worst dingbats our society has on offer?
1084460	1085580	No.
1085580	1087020	No voting.
1087020	1088220	Smashing.
1088220	1089820	Well, you know what?
1089820	1091660	Since she's the one with the plan, apparently,
1091660	1093940	I guess just do whatever she says.
1093940	1095700	Rebel girl!
1095700	1097420	Rebel girl!
1097420	1098220	Rebel girl!
1098220	1101340	Tabby, why don't you go take a bath?
1101340	1103260	Meow.
1103260	1104180	Mm.
1104180	1105220	Good kitty.
1105220	1106620	Don't close the door!
1106620	1107540	Dear comrades,
1107540	1110940	the Central Catgirl Committee has determined that ContraPoints is,
1110940	1112020	and always has been,
1112020	1114540	counter-revolutionary bourgeois revisionism.
1114540	1118100	The Department of Information has therefore replaced the remainder of this video
1118100	1120380	with a tribute to the immortal science of tabia-,
1121180	1122540	dirt, dirt.
1122540	1127140	No.
1127140	1127940	No‚Äî
1127940	1128680	No!
1128680	1129940	22
1159940	1189920	Thank you.
1189940	1195320	Thank you.
