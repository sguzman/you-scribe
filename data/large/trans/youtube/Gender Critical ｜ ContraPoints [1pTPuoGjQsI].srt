1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,480
on the day that the female eunuch was issued in america a person in flapping draperies rushed up

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,800
to me and grabbed my hand thank you it breathed hoarsely thank you so much for all you've done

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:22,040
for us girls i smirked and nodded and stepped backward trying to extricate my hand from the

4
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:29,860
enormous knuckly hairy beringan paw that clutched it the face staring into mine was thickly coated

5
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:36,600
with a pancake makeup through which the stubble was already burgeoning in futile competition with

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,880
a dine-out wig of immense luxuries and two pairs of false eyelashes against the bony ribs that

7
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:50,520
could be counted through its flimsy scarf dress swung a polished steel woman's liberation emblem

8
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:57,400
i should have said you're a man the female eunuch has done less than nothing for you

9
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,980
piss off

10
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,400
you

11
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:09,080
let's go adult human females

12
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:22,680
first of all a reminder that this video is a female only space so if there are any men here

13
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:29,140
today get out i mean unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own

14
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:29,840
in which case i'm going to let you know that this video is a female only space

15
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,340
i'm going to let you know that this video is a male only space

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,100
like comment subscribe so look it's 2019 and i think most people have heard about TERFs

17
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,340
trans exclusionary radical feminists you know these fanatics like jermaine greer who call

18
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:48,660
trans women it and think trans men are lost lesbian sisters you guys do know about trans men right male

19
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:53,260
to female is not the only type of transgender person there's also people who were born well

20
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,820
people who were assigned people who were always

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,000
people who are born people who were always

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,560
people who are always

23
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:58,960
people who are always

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,320
People who identify.

25
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,760
TERFs don't like being called TERFs.

26
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,640
They think it's a term of disparagement, which it is.

27
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,960
They call themselves radical feminists, radfems,

28
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,080
or lately, gender critical.

29
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,920
The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity,

30
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,820
gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal construct,

31
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,560
and biological sex is the only thing

32
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,180
that makes a person a man or a woman.

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,380
In the past on this channel,

34
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,160
I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry,

35
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,180
man-hating bigots whose only real tactic

36
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,280
is accusing trans women of being creepy men.

37
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,520
And there definitely are some people

38
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,740
who are really like that, but I wanna be fair.

39
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,880
I wanna be balanced.

40
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,960
So in preparation to make this video,

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,420
I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people

42
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,200
who used to be gender critical feminists

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,520
to share their stories with me.

44
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,020
And I got hundreds of responses,

45
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,400
a lot of them from women who've had

46
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,280
traumatic experiences with men,

47
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,480
and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender

48
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,020
where women and men are completely separate species,

49
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:52,080
where women are safe and men are dangerous.

50
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,260
And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people

51
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,640
into their picture of the world,

52
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,120
at first challenged their sense of stability

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,080
and comfort.

54
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,660
It was difficult emotional work,

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,020
work they needed to do, but still difficult.

56
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,180
And that makes total sense to me.

57
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:06,020
Like it's very easy for me to understand

58
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,360
why someone would feel that way.

59
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,980
So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted

60
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,560
to the gender critical worldview.

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,860
And in this video, I don't just wanna parody TERFs.

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,700
This time I wanna really engage with gender critical ideas

63
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,440
in the public arena of free speech, open communication,

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
dialogue, conversation, debate, idea,

65
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,640
marketplace, expression, discourse.

66
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,540
Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner rad femme.

67
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,960
She's a little shy, sure, but she's here.

68
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,020
Not queer, reads a lot of Germaine Greer.

69
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,660
And when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty,

70
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:35,420
she's feeling ex-extra biological.

71
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:38,440
And when the full moon shines, she speaks.

72
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,780
Oh, this is agony.

73
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,240
I'm a biological woman trapped

74
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,160
in the body of a male narcissist.

75
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,760
Can you imagine?

76
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,360
Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure.

77
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,600
But she's not a bigot, you know.

78
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,620
I'm sure she doesn't hate trans people.

79
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:56,700
She just has a few concerns.

80
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,760
You know, it's like you're not even allowed

81
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,180
to ask questions anymore or you're accused of transphobia.

82
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:04,000
We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology

83
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,920
that we, the public, never got a chance to debate.

84
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:09,200
We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy,

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,480
yet here we are allowing biological males

86
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,340
to run rampant in women's spaces,

87
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,220
foisting penises on lesbians,

88
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,260
and indoctrinating our children with the ludicrous dogma

89
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,800
that girls can become boys with a change of costume.

90
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,640
Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.

91
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,240
She goes on like that for hours.

92
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,520
It's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator shaft

93
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,020
with the ghost of Anita Bryant.

94
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,920
Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?

95
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,860
Do you have any idea how many decades

96
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,100
I fought for your rights?

97
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,380
Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?

98
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,980
Scholars remain divided.

99
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,300
It does seem like it's getting harder

100
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,380
to have conversations about difficult topics.

101
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,780
You know, our children are coming of age

102
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,620
in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face consequences

103
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,160
for simply having a politically incorrect opinion

104
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,420
about the Jewish question.

105
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,920
It's PC run AMOC.

106
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,000
It's a Hanna catastrophe.

107
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,300
Problematic banter aside,

108
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
the current discourse about transgender issues

109
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,360
is an explosion of untreated sewage.

110
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,080
We have far-right politicians menacing us

111
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,700
with legal discrimination and erasure.

112
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,900
We have fear mongering and hostility in the press.

113
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,280
And that, combined with high rates of family rejection

114
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,100
and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.

115
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,760
So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing,

116
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,760
and shield ourselves behind simple, unambiguous slogans.

117
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,560
Trans women are women.

118
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:16,500
Which is true.

119
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,340
We are women.

120
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,320
But, ooh, that was a sinister but.

121
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,160
Watch out for that.

122
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
What happens is that people who don't really understand

123
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,580
trans issues, in other words, most people,

124
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,380
have lots of unanswered questions about the details.

125
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,420
In particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory,

126
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:33,080
but not transfeminism, might wonder things like,

127
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,160
how can you be a woman

128
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,240
without the oppression experiences of girlhood?

129
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,700
Why can't you just be a feminine man

130
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,480
instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?

131
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,280
Why are misogynistic gender ideologues

132
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,240
erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?

133
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,420
Trans people don't like engaging with these questions

134
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,500
because most of the time,

135
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,740
they're just brandished as weapons against us.

136
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,880
You know, it's like when a man asks,

137
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:56,040
if society is so sexist against women,

138
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,500
then why is it that men are 90s

139
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,480
and 7% of combat fatalities, feminazis?

140
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,180
Like, you could sit there for three hours

141
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:04,140
trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal,

142
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:07,620
but wouldn't you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?

143
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,980
Because nine times out of 10,

144
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,680
that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities.

145
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,220
He's just trolling you to shut down

146
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:14,800
whatever actual point you are making.

147
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,500
And the same goes for people telling me,

148
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,760
you sure do like wearing nails and makeup.

149
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,140
Is that all you think there is to being a woman?

150
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,180
Could you define womanhood for me?

151
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,620
Like, they don't actually care.

152
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,960
They're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.

153
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,860
But if you really are sincerely wondering

154
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,720
about the answer to these troll questions,

155
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,880
and many people are,

156
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,940
then you actually need fairly complicated

157
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,120
and nuanced answers,

158
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,400
which is why they make such good troll questions,

159
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,020
because they waste a lot of your time.

160
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,960
In this video, I want to take at face value

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,300
the questions and concerns associated

162
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,000
with gender-critical hostility to trans people,

163
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,960
and I want to try to give nuanced answers

164
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,580
rather than dogmatic ones.

165
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:52,200
Now, the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard,

166
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,460
so I might fuck something up.

167
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,640
And a lot of trans people want me to represent them

168
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,020
absolutely perfectly.

169
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:00,080
So, if I do fuck something up,

170
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,460
well, just read me to filth on Twitter

171
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,080
like you always do, you little shits.

172
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,180
Love you.

173
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:08,100
Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.

174
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,920
Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?

175
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,760
We have 13 beautiful women on our show today.

176
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,700
Only the catch is that some of them are actually men.

177
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,240
Oops, wrong channel.

178
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:23,480
Concern one, gender metaphysics.

179
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,640
There is no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.

180
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,960
There are no pink brains and blue brains.

181
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,520
Just because you want to be a woman

182
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,680
doesn't mean you are one.

183
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,980
This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.

184
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:37,200
Trans people often use metaphorical language

185
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,640
to describe feelings that are difficult to put into words,

186
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,380
and that's how I understand the trapped

187
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,700
in the wrong body language.

188
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,080
Is there literally such a thing as a male soul

189
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,380
trapped in a female body, or vice versa?

190
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,020
I personally don't believe there is,

191
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,620
but I'm a little biased.

192
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,940
I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman,

193
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,400
and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine habit.

194
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,040
As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting

195
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,640
a correlation between binary transgender identity

196
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,180
and cross-sex brain anatomy,

197
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,980
but the evidence really doesn't justify claims

198
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,980
about female brains and male bodies or anything like that.

199
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,560
Brain differences between men and women

200
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,420
are statistical averages of things

201
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,180
like gray and white matter density,

202
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,800
not, as the term female brain implies,

203
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,320
distinct anatomical structures like penises and vaginas.

204
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,900
So I personally don't believe

205
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,600
in any gender metaphysics at all.

206
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,640
I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person,

207
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,400
so much for the unquestionable dogma of the trans cult,

208
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,060
and that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man

209
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,880
rather than as always having been a woman.

210
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,260
But it's important to remember

211
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,620
that while I may not fit the typical profile,

212
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,200
I am not real and not valid.

213
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
But in any case, I live as a woman now,

214
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,020
and that's kind of just what's happening

215
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,260
whether you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.

216
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,860
My view is well expressed by Katherine McKinnon.

217
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,220
I always thought I don't care

218
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,640
how someone becomes a woman or a man.

219
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,600
It doesn't matter to me.

220
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,100
Anybody who identifies as a woman,

221
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,060
wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman,

222
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,160
as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.

223
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,240
Concern two, gender stereotypes.

224
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,020
What do you mean you live as a woman?

225
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:10,320
You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes

226
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,340
by putting on nails, makeup, and a fake girly voice?

227
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,120
Listen, sweaty, first of all,

228
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,080
my girly voice is very fucking real.

229
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,680
Second, my clothes, makeup, voice,

230
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,700
none of this makes me a woman.

231
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,600
No trans woman thinks that femininity,

232
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,100
and womanhood are the same.

233
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,380
Rather, we're using a cultural language

234
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,900
of feminine signifiers to prompt others

235
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,380
to see us for what we are.

236
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:34,480
Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends

237
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,400
don't really understand why I'm presenting

238
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,500
in such a meticulously feminine way.

239
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,140
Like, they think I'm wearing ombre lips at 11 a.m.

240
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,040
because I'm playing some kind of clout game,

241
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,940
which I am, but also, if one person calls me sir,

242
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,360
that's gonna ruin my day.

243
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,920
So I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall

244
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,720
in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.

245
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,600
I think butch or gender non-conforming cis women,

246
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,660
sometimes side-eye hyper-feminine trans women,

247
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,380
because they don't identify with this vision

248
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:01,780
of womanhood at all, and they've had to struggle

249
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,540
since childhood against a society that's told them

250
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,840
they have to be feminine.

251
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,800
And I completely sympathize with that.

252
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,720
I think there should be more gender freedom,

253
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,600
less coercion, less restriction.

254
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,960
But also, I have had to fight against the same society

255
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,540
that told me I should really, really, really not be this.

256
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,940
So, I feel like we should be able to form

257
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,700
some kind of solidarity here.

258
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,540
What, what, what?

259
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,380
Sorry, abolish gender.

260
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,780
But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs

261
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,700
of masculinity and femininity, not conforming to them.

262
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,700
Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.

263
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,040
Abolish gender?

264
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,260
Well, that sounds like an ambitious project

265
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:43,320
for one transsexual, but I mean, I'll give it a try.

266
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,880
Solanus be praised.

267
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,820
No nails, no makeup.

268
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.

269
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,800
I did it, everyone.

270
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,440
I abolished gender.

271
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,580
Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier.

272
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,900
So, I should probably get rid of that.

273
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,440
How is she though?

274
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,940
She's feeling a little genderless.

275
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,060
I guess the way I position my body is still gendered

276
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,320
and there's a gendered cadence to my voice.

277
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,980
So, what I'm gonna do is just hold my hands up genderlessly

278
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,060
and speak in a genderless robot voice.

279
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,500
My name is 5-4-6-6-4-1-7.

280
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,080
I have no gender.

281
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,160
Patriarchy is over.

282
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,640
I guess English is still a patriarchal language, right?

283
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,940
So, I should probably be communicating

284
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,280
with a series of genderless sounds.

285
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:24,100
Meow, meow.

286
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,820
Meow, meow, meow, meow, I can't stand this.

287
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,420
Fuck this.

288
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,040
Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea.

289
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,780
Like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth

290
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:35,000
didn't determine what kind of life you could live?

291
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,620
But that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change,

292
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,220
kind of like abolish borders.

293
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,680
Your utopian pipe dream is valid.

294
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,880
And denying trans people their gender identity

295
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,320
because abolish gender is kind of like denying citizenship

296
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,480
to immigrants because abolish borders.

297
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,820
Like, you're targeting the people

298
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,600
who are the most vulnerable under the present system, and then,

299
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,520
leveraging that system against them

300
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,260
under the pretense of abolishing it.

301
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,980
You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists

302
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,220
in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments, like,

303
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,160
why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?

304
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,420
You should be abolishing gender,

305
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:09,220
not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.

306
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,300
No, they don't attack the gender expression

307
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,040
of people with power and influence.

308
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,020
They're all on Twitter harassing some poor,

309
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,280
newly-out trans woman with 200 followers,

310
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,820
and calling her a creepy man,

311
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,840
and mocking her for being feminine ineptly,

312
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,820
or being too feminine, or not being feminine enough.

313
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,160
Like, when they say abolish gender,

314
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,760
what they really mean is abolish trans people.

315
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:31,000
It's almost like this is a hate movement

316
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,880
hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist platitudes.

317
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,380
But surely, I must be missing something.

318
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,360
Concern four, male privilege.

319
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,540
It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement

320
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,100
that you think you can just claim womanhood for yourself

321
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,620
without living any of the struggle that entails.

322
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:52,180
So look, I'm a successful, white, middle-class trans woman.

323
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,620
In the grand scheme of things,

324
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,460
I'm really not very oppressed.

325
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:58,960
I may not be the 1%, but I am the tranny 1%.

326
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,020
So I don't like to complain

327
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,060
about every little micro-aggression I experience,

328
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,720
because under the circumstances,

329
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,540
it just seems a little gauche.

330
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,680
And I don't like things that are gauche.

331
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,060
But I've had cis feminists of my race and class

332
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,080
tell me that I have no idea what it's like

333
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,980
to be talked over and interrupted by men.

334
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,280
Actually, Kropotkin.

335
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,040
Or to experience street harassment,

336
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,580
or to have to treat every first date

337
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,740
like a potentially life-threatening situation.

338
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,900
And it's just bizarre to me that they think that.

339
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,340
Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?

340
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,320
You think men treat me as their equal?

341
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,100
You think street harassers are gonna treat me

342
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,100
with dignity and respect because I have a Y chromosome?

343
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,340
Hey, beautiful, where you going, baby?

344
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,260
Where you going?

345
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,360
Oh, it's tranny.

346
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,200
Excuse me, sir, my mistake.

347
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,440
Please proceed freely to your destination.

348
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,500
Come on, people, use your heads.

349
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,060
When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it,

350
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:49,900
what do you think the guy

351
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,700
in the steps of the liquor store is gonna say?

352
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,580
When a trans woman doesn't pass,

353
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,900
it's not like society simply treats her like a man.

354
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,000
No, you get treated as monster gender,

355
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,740
pronouns it and spit,

356
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,700
and male privilege is not a good description

357
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,260
of that experience at all.

358
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,620
Once you start passing as a woman,

359
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,040
it's really a step up,

360
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,840
even though women get treated bad,

361
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:11,260
because it's still better to be a she than an it.

362
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,580
Now, gender-critical feminists are really skeptical

363
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,080
of the whole notion of passing.

364
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,960
They think they can always clock a tran,

365
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,900
and they assume everyone else can too.

366
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,900
But that's just not reality.

367
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,240
I mean, I'm only a year and a half

368
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,480
into my transition,

369
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,560
and at this point I've had zero surgeries,

370
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,400
and it's been like six months

371
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,320
since I was last misgendered offline.

372
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,820
I mean, a person with a good eye for it

373
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,060
will probably clock me,

374
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,640
and maybe a lot of people have just been indoctrinated

375
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,540
into politically correct gender ideology,

376
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,160
but like, you really think the gas station attendant

377
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,700
and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy

378
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,300
are all calling me miss and ma'am

379
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,760
because of post-modernism?

380
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,060
I know some of you are gonna sneak off

381
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,780
to your shitty little radfem forums

382
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,360
and obsess over how manly and clockable I am, but like,

383
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,080
at the end of the day, I'm a woman.

384
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,840
At the end of the day, what am I gonna trust?

385
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,560
The deranged hate posting of 25 frothing anons,

386
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,860
or every social interaction I've had for months?

387
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,320
I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.

388
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,580
I'm ahi tuna, and you're mackerel sweaty.

389
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:06,180
Take a fuckin' sip, babes.

390
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,160
I love that.

391
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,340
Concern five, male socialization.

392
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:15,700
So you had a male upbringing,

393
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,900
you never experienced the traumas of girlhood,

394
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,000
you benefited from male privilege for decades,

395
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,580
and now you think none of that matters?

396
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,840
You are because of how you were socialized,

397
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,400
not because of how you dress.

398
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,000
All right, it's time to crack open the nuance.

399
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,020
So on the one hand, you're partially right.

400
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,060
I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled

401
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,060
as a nine-year-old girl,

402
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,760
or what that does to a child's psyche.

403
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,380
That kind of thing didn't start happening to me

404
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,360
till I was an adult,

405
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,520
when I knew what I was getting into and was ready for it.

406
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,860
That's very different from what cis women go through.

407
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,140
My upbringing in adolescence has more in common

408
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:49,040
with a typical man than a typical woman,

409
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,200
and many of my experiences from those days,

410
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,460
I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.

411
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,720
I absolutely benefited from male privilege,

412
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,580
and it did influence who I was.

413
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,000
And who I was in my late teens and early 20s

414
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,620
was an anti-feminist shithead

415
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,440
who had no idea what women go through.

416
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,640
And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that,

417
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,880
because in trans discourse,

418
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,620
it's just accepted as obvious that trans men

419
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,440
know what it's like to be raised as women,

420
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,340
and to be influenced by those formative female experiences.

421
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,060
But when it comes to the early life experiences

422
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,760
of trans women, we're supposed to say,

423
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,080
"'When I was five years old, I loved wearing my mom's high

424
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,220
heels,' or else say nothing at all."

425
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,640
There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath,

426
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,500
where she describes the way living as a woman

427
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,480
stifles an adventurous spirit

428
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,660
and her longing for a male experience.

429
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:35,960
Yes, my consuming desires to mingle with road crews,

430
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,140
sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars,

431
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:43,960
to be part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording.

432
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,280
All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl,

433
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:51,080
a female, always supposedly in danger,

434
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,040
of assault and battery.

435
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,960
My consuming interest in men and their lives

436
00:16:55,960 --> 00:17:00,000
is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them,

437
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,540
or as an invitation to intimacy.

438
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:06,940
Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.

439
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,600
I want to be able to sleep in an open field,

440
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,220
to travel west, to walk freely at night."

441
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:15,840
So I got to do all of that in my early twenties.

442
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,040
And what I discovered is I hate sleeping in open fields.

443
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,500
I despise the West.

444
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,780
And I'd really rather stay inside,

445
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,820
collecting ceramics and sucking dick.

446
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,380
Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman.

447
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,420
And I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is a man

448
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,020
because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews

449
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,000
for reasons that are inconceivable to me.

450
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,720
What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-twenties,

451
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,400
I realized that I was inhabiting a gender, body,

452
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,420
and sexual persona that were drastically wrong for me.

453
00:17:41,420 --> 00:17:43,920
And I tried every possible alternative to transitioning

454
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,260
before realizing that I had an irrepressible need

455
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,200
to become a woman.

456
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,700
So I changed.

457
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,760
And when I changed,

458
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,580
society's treatment of me changed.

459
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,760
Socialization doesn't end with childhood.

460
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,320
It's a lifelong process.

461
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,140
For example, when I transitioned,

462
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,900
my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers,

463
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,360
and radical feminist haters started commenting

464
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,780
on my physical appearance about 20 to 30 times more often.

465
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,460
And I had to get used to that being something

466
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,780
that matters a lot more.

467
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,400
That said, resocialization takes time.

468
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,100
And sometimes trans people who are early in transition

469
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,860
have most of that process ahead of them.

470
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,540
I also think we have to take into account

471
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,640
the age at which a person transitions.

472
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,480
I'm Petrus, whomst we stan.

473
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,320
Oh, we stan.

474
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,160
We stan.

475
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,000
Oh, we stan.

476
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,820
I stan.

477
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,660
Oh, we stan.

478
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:26,720
She transitioned as a child,

479
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,700
and I imagine was socialized more or less

480
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,820
the same as a cis woman.

481
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,400
Whereas, Caitlyn Jenner, whomst, well,

482
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,820
just whomst.

483
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,680
She made millions of dollars in men's sports.

484
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,540
She had six children by three wives.

485
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,000
She transitioned in retirement at age 65

486
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,620
and told Buzzfeed that the hardest part of being a woman

487
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,580
is figuring out what to wear.

488
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,180
This is the only trans woman most people have heard of.

489
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,200
It makes me want to cry.

490
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,400
Like, I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman,

491
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,280
but I am saying that anyone who wants to argue

492
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,600
that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective

493
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,100
doesn't have a leg to stand on.

494
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,140
But also, trans women often don't experience

495
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,300
male socialization the way cis men do.

496
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,080
Many trans women are feminine and queer

497
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,440
before they transition and have always experienced

498
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,900
a kind of femphobia that is rooted in misogyny.

499
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,840
Some trans women also identified as women

500
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,220
years before transitioning and internalized

501
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,940
society's messaging about women

502
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,040
more than society's messaging about men.

503
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,180
Now, that's still not the same

504
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,440
as living in society as a girl from birth,

505
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,840
but it's also pretty different

506
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,000
from the socialization of most cis men.

507
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,300
I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue

508
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,920
that trans women never experience male privilege

509
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,340
is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege

510
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,660
as a proxy for calling us men.

511
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:35,700
Pull up your zipper.

512
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,180
Your male privilege is hanging out.

513
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:40,820
I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point

514
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,620
for many gender-critical feminists

515
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,180
is that there's an element here of stolen valor,

516
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:47,580
the sense of injustice that people are claiming

517
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,160
their identity without experiencing it.

518
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,180
It reminds me of what in the trans community

519
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:54,180
are called transmedicalists,

520
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,560
people who insist the only real trans people

521
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,900
are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.

522
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,560
In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing

523
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,120
that confirms your identity is pain.

524
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,020
What it is to be trans is to despise your body.

525
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:10,080
What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.

526
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:12,120
You didn't suffer like I've suffered.

527
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,740
You don't know what it's like.

528
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,240
You know, I'm tempted to strike back

529
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,200
by saying that you don't know what it's like

530
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,500
to occupy an identity so stigmatized

531
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,040
that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity so stigmatized

532
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:19,540
that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity so stigmatized

533
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,040
that most of the people who are attracted to you in private

534
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,040
are too ashamed to admit it in public.

535
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,440
You don't know what it's like to have a body so non-normative

536
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,700
that you're shut out of whole areas of society.

537
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,060
I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest

538
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,840
does nothing but to provoke infighting

539
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,640
between trans women and cis women

540
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,020
at a time when we should be marching side-by-side

541
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,800
to destroy video games forever.

542
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,560
Hashtag yes all gamers.

543
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,440
Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.

544
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,740
You don't know what it's like

545
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,360
to grow up being shamed for your periods,

546
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,040
to fear unwanted pregnancy,

547
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,040
to have to fight for your right to abortion,

548
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:54,280
to bear the pain of childbirth.

549
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,400
Well, yeah, that's true.

550
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,840
My inner Rad Femme sways in a gentle, victorious samba.

551
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,680
I do think it's important for trans women

552
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,520
to stand in solidarity with cis women

553
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,000
on issues like period equity and abortion rights,

554
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,840
and to learn about the experiences of cis women

555
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,440
to form a more complete understanding

556
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,640
of the female condition.

557
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,120
But of course, no individual woman experiences

558
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,880
all the things women experience,

559
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,360
and individual women understand the meaning of womanhood.

560
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,880
In drastically different ways.

561
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,320
For some women, having babies

562
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,480
is the most essentially womanly experience.

563
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,800
For others, maybe it's having an abortion.

564
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,720
I mean, not actually, but you know,

565
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,640
TERFs pretend it is to own the trannies.

566
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,040
For me, it's receiving 12-paragraph emails

567
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,040
in my business inbox from married men

568
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,800
struggling through the existential crisis

569
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:38,760
of some kind of shemale-themed sexual awakening.

570
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,120
Also, do you wanna be a guest

571
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,440
on my podcast, Free Speech Radio?

572
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:45,000
But also, not all women experience their womanhood

573
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,360
as essentially oppressive,

574
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,280
or centered around the pain of reproductive health.

575
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,320
And that's not the only reason

576
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,760
I'm not talking about the gender gap.

577
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,480
I'm talking about the gender gap

578
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,600
in the capacity of men.

579
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,480
When Shania Twain sang,

580
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,440
Man, I Feel Like a Woman,

581
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,680
she wasn't talking about having a coat hanger abortion

582
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,320
in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.

583
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,560
Man, I feel like shit.

584
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,840
Concern seven, erasing female vocabulary.

585
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,720
Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary needed

586
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,880
to discuss women's bodies and women's oppression.

587
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,200
We are now expected to talk about pregnant people

588
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,480
and menstruators just to appease the gender ideologues.

589
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,840
I'm a menstruator.

590
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,640
I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N,

591
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,040
and I will not be erased.

592
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,200
Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator or pregnant people

593
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:28,920
and are thinking,

594
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:31,160
what the fuck kind of Orwellian newspeak

595
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,920
gender cuckoldry is that?

596
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:36,040
Take a deep breath, clear your mind, here's the tea.

597
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,600
Some medical organizations have recently begun using the term

598
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,840
pregnant people instead of pregnant women.

599
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,280
And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word menstruators

600
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,600
in a tweet about the repeal of a tampon tax.

601
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,960
This prompted some conservative TERF and Christian publications

602
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:54,520
to post panicked commentaries warning that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.

603
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:58,840
But in fact, medical language that assumes that everyone with a uterus is a woman

604
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,760
erases trans men or non-binary people who menstruate and get pregnant.

605
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,800
So saying pregnant women in this context erases them,

606
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,000
whereas saying pregnant people includes them and cis women

607
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,280
and doesn't erase anyone.

608
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,920
Except for...

609
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,720
...Cincinnatians, because we all know they're not people.

610
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,960
Take your shitty chili elsewhere, but I'm a woman,

611
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,480
not a goddamn menstruator.

612
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,720
What kind of misogynistic madness is it to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?

613
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:25,640
I actually agree with you that the word menstruator sounds pretty dehumanizing,

614
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,000
and the trans men I've talked to about this aren't the biggest fans of it either.

615
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,240
Sometimes it takes a while to settle on language that's both inclusive and usable,

616
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,840
and my prediction is that menstruators is not gonna work out.

617
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,520
Maybe people who menstruate?

618
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,200
But why can't I just say woman?

619
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,280
That's what I am.

620
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,040
You can't just say woman.

621
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,480
That is what you are.

622
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:48,680
I'm just asking that you stop referring to yourself as a woman.

623
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:53,080
Institutional medical language is designed to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.

624
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:58,040
No one is proposing that we stop calling individual women pregnant women or expectant mothers.

625
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,000
Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.

626
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,960
I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.

627
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:07,800
I notice you're not suggesting doctors start saying people with prostates.

628
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
Though I am definitely suggesting that.

629
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:15,480
But trans activists are invading feminist spaces and telling women we can't discuss our own bodies.

630
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,640
I have no problem with cis feminists discussing or celebrating periods

631
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,280
or wearing pussy hats at political marches or free bleeding all over the National Mall.

632
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,480
I mean, someone has to.

633
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,040
The National Mall is not gonna bleed on itself.

634
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,120
I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate their reproductive anatomy

635
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:36,200
in defiance of a society that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.

636
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:41,320
The problem arises only when menstruation or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender trans men

637
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:43,720
or exclude wombs whom doth not bleed.

638
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,320
I mean, trans women do bleed.

639
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:47,560
But only when we cut ourselves.

640
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:53,640
No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.

641
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,200
Concern 8.

642
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,480
TERF is a slur.

643
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,080
TERF is a slur designed to silence women.

644
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,680
Nay, it is hate speech designed to incite violence against women.

645
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:09,560
The word TERF is a pejorative for a person who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism.

646
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,000
But it's not a slur.

647
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,240
A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race, religion, gender, or sexuality.

648
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,560
The word misogynist is pejorative, it has only negative connotations,

649
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,440
and is often used as an insult, but it's not a slur.

650
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,880
It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs, not a type of person.

651
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,720
The same is true of the word TERF.

652
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,440
It's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors that deserve to be derogated.

653
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,320
The term gender critical is really a euphemism,

654
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:40,200
recently created to replace TERF with a phrase that doesn't have such negative connotations.

655
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,080
It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race realist,

656
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,080
which was invented by racists wanting a

657
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,960
more flattering and respectable description of their beliefs.

658
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:52,200
I've used the term gender critical in this video to be inviting to fence-sitters,

659
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,360
but I refuse to cooperate with racists who want me to use their euphemisms,

660
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,840
and I generally do the same with TERFs.

661
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,960
Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person.

662
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,760
I usually like to call people by whatever they want to be called.

663
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:07,400
But when it comes to race realist or gender critical,

664
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,560
every time I use these phrases,

665
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:13,720
I'm essentially becoming an accomplice in their scheme to legitimize bigotry.

666
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,000
And I have especially...

667
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,760
little patience for TERF requests for linguistic decorum,

668
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:24,200
since most of the language used by TERFs is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful,

669
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,600
harmful, and insulting to trans people.

670
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,800
For instance, TERFs refer to any and all trans-related surgery as mutilation.

671
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,280
They call trans women TIMs, an acronym for trans-identified males,

672
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:39,720
and trans men TIFs, trans-identified females,

673
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,760
obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.

674
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Just to give you a sample of typical TERF

675
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,440
prose, here are a couple comments from literally the first thread I saw

676
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,480
on the Gender Critical subreddit while I was working on this video.

677
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,160
And I have to admit to considerably more contempt for the likes of

678
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,440
since he makes a point of taking selfies with ridiculous,

679
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,600
insulting-to-women facial expressions.

680
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,800
I also get a good laugh at TIMs putting their hands up to their chins.

681
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,480
They're trying to look all dainty and to hide their Adam's apple,

682
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,960
but it only draws more attention to their

683
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,680
ENORMAL

684
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,960
MISS MAN hands.

685
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,200
I saw an AGP photoshoot with this neanderthal in his 50s,

686
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,320
was posing with one leg up like a flamingo,

687
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,320
his hands dainty at his ear,

688
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,960
in every photo,

689
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,800
even group ones at events.

690
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,120
Now I was just grossed out.

691
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,160
So there it is.

692
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,680
That's what this is really about.

693
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,800
In this video, I've gone through a list of gender critical concerns,

694
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,000
and I've provided responses I hope the average person will find fair.

695
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,680
But I would be lying to you by omission,

696
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:47,720
if I were to end this video without being real with you

697
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:52,040
about what the core of the gender critical movement is actually about.

698
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:55,320
See what TERFs do in public is advance what, on the surface,

699
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,880
are a series of feminist critiques of trans people.

700
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,440
For example, the critique that hyperfeminine trans women

701
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,960
are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes designed to oppress women.

702
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,680
At a glance, this appears to be a critique of the way some trans women behave and present themselves.

703
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,720
But in the next breath, these same TERFs will argue that trans women are mannish, unfeminine perverts

704
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,520
who are forcing masturbation on them.

705
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,760
So if trans women being feminine is bad,

706
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,000
and trans women being masculine is bad,

707
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:25,320
then there really is no way that trans women could behave that TERFs would accept.

708
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:29,240
So in fact, what TERFs really oppose is not trans women being feminine,

709
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,080
or trans women being masculine,

710
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,720
but trans women being trans women.

711
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,400
In other words, the fundamental issue underlying all these phony concerns is transphobia.

712
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:42,920
Simple animosity towards trans people's very existence.

713
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,440
And it's pretty easy to recognize,

714
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,240
just from the tone they use when they talk about us.

715
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,280
When you read through the gender-critical subreddit or TERF Twitter,

716
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:54,280
what you see is just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes

717
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:59,240
draped over a jagged thorn tangle of visceral disgust and targeted hate.

718
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,120
The pure, exuberant malice of it all is not even disguised in the Germaine Greer quote

719
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:08,040
from the opening of this video, or in the average gender-critical forum post.

720
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,640
The enormous, knuckly, hairy, beringed paw.

721
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,120
The pancake makeup through which the stubble,

722
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,880
was already burgeoning.

723
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,200
This Neanderthal in his fifties.

724
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,560
Ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.

725
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,800
Now I was just grossed out.

726
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:29,640
What gender-critical feminism really amounts to is a baroque palace of rationalizations

727
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,080
built on a foundation of pure disgust.

728
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,640
In this respect, it's just like homophobia.

729
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,240
You know, I came of age when gay marriage was the most contentious social debate,

730
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,840
and the arguments people made,

731
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,280
that marriage was under attack,

732
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,040
that the children would be traumatized,

733
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,880
that bestiality would be next,

734
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,200
that this tiny minority was undermining all our institutions with their outrageous demands,

735
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,360
it was all just nonsense.

736
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,800
If you got a conservative drunk, as I used to be able to do,

737
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,880
Sylvia, I wish I could give you what I had,

738
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,480
he would just blurt out the truth,

739
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:04,360
which was that the sight of two grown men locking lips made him wanna vom.

740
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,440
Homophobia and transphobia do not originate in the frontal cortex.

741
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,600
They come from the lizard brain disgust response we evolved to deal with blood,

742
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,800
infection, vomit, fear.

743
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,360
It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance,

744
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,960
because it's the same disgust I felt toward myself for years.

745
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,160
It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman on the L platform in Chicago five years ago,

746
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:28,760
and decided then and there to abandon my first attempt at transition.

747
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,880
It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.

748
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,920
It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,

749
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,240
because transphobia is the only thing that's ever going to stop you from moving forward.

750
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,640
It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,

751
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,640
because transphobia is the only thing that's ever going to stop you from moving forward.

752
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,360
It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,

753
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,640
because transphobia is always the same.

754
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:50,360
It always comes from the same place, and it's always expressed in the same kinds of ways.

755
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,600
I recently rewatched that classic viral video from an old episode of Cops,

756
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,240
where a police officer humiliates a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.

757
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,840
The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID, misgenders her,

758
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,760
deadnames her, mocks her clothes and makeup, and calls her a cross-dresser.

759
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:08,920
It's all so repetitive and familiar.

760
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:12,920
It's the same arsenal of petty sadism you see in the right-wing press,

761
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,200
on 4chan, on doxxing forums, on gender-critical Reddit, it's all the same.

762
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,600
What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair

763
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:24,440
is her unbreakable wit and confidence in the face of transphobic abuse.

764
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,760
The single most iconic moment is when,

765
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,160
after being grilled in the back of the cop car amid a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering,

766
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,320
she glances back at the cop and says,

767
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,080
Excuse my beauty.

768
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,120
Excuse your beauty.

769
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:36,760
Okay.

770
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:42,040
And that, right there, is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture,

771
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:46,440
the resilience of trans women, the assumption of a regal posture,

772
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,840
and even the most abject conditions.

773
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,200
And that's really all you can do, because there's just no reasoning a transphobe out of bigotry.

774
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,200
So, to any die-hard gender-critical feminists still watching this,

775
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,880
what else can I say except, on behalf of all trans women,

776
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
excuse my beauty,

777
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,520
TERF.

778
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:42,040


779
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Tongue pop is not the solution to every problem.

780
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:45,880
Or is it?

781
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,220
I posted an invitation to Twitter

782
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:50,280
for people who used to be gender-critical feminists

783
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,080
to chew me in the back of the head.

784
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,440
It's PC run AMAC.

785
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,700
AMAC.

786
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,320
Look at it.

787
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,160
Okay.

788
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,000
It's so stupid.

789
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,320
It's so stupid.

790
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,540
Run AMAC.

791
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:10,380
Corona Premier.

792
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,220
See?

793
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,880
Turf beer of choice.

794
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,480
My chromosomes need to unwind

795
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,660
after a hard day of hating trans people.

796
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,820
It is absa...

797
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,660
These titties.

798
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,320
I just saw them and I just lost it.

799
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,160
I just...

800
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,000
It's just...

801
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,020
What?

802
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:28,560
I-M-A-W-M-B-Y-N.

803
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,320
You do know how I struggle with spelling.

804
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,160
V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.

805
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,040
No one knows what it's like

806
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,260
to be a sad,

807
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,680
trian,

808
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:44,140
to be a trashcan

809
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,500
for trap chasers,

810
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,340
jizz.
