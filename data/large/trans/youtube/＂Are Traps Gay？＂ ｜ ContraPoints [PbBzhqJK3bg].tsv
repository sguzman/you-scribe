0	19640	Hello, my devilish darlings! It is I, Lenora LaVey, your hostess of horror, and I'm here
19640	25640	to warn you that some viewers may find tonight's program disturbing. There will be discussion
25640	31580	of transphobic slurs and violence, and graphic displays of anime. Ugh. So if that's gonna
31580	38800	make you sad, please don't watch this. Unless you enjoy sadness. I know I do. But your macabre
38800	44500	mother wants you to take care of yourself, so here, I made you a wet pot of hot tea and
44500	49240	you can take it out on the balcony and pour it on some pedestrians. That always cheers
49240	51240	me up!
51240	54440	1. Traps
54440	63400	Gentlemen of the Academy, it is my duty to submit to you the findings of my latest memetic
63400	69980	research. Many sleepless nights have I lingered in all the great libraries of Europe, scrutinizing
69980	77720	volumes ancient and modern, in search of the answer to two fundamental questions. What
77720	81500	are traps? And be they gay?
81500	84420	With respect to the former inquiry, I adjure you that you will not be able to find any
84420	85420	answer to these questions.
85420	91660	2. A treatise by the lady scholar known as the pedantic Romantic, wherein the derivation
91660	96660	of the word trap is traced to patrons of animated pictures from the Orient.
96660	97660	Curious.
97660	103180	The chronicle begins in the first years of the present century, when devotees of picture
103180	108660	forums would proclaim the idiom, it's a trap, alongside the likeness of one Admiral
108660	113380	Akbar, to suggest that some manner of deception had taken place.
113380	114380	3. Contemporaneous.
114380	120120	The most notorious to this was a most whimsical mania for depictions of nymphic Japonesques,
120120	125720	to some of which the aforementioned slogan would be rejoined. The implication being
125720	130740	that the subject of the portrait was not in sooth a daughter of Eve, but rather that the
130740	136180	spectator had fallen prey to some manner of transvestite skullduggery.
136180	142500	Furthermore, it appears that from the first, the designation trap has signified not only
142500	144220	transvestites, but transeptites.
144220	151240	And this must needs be remarked, for it is evident such persons ofttimes inflame the
151240	153000	lust of ordinary men.
153000	159300	It is hence with respect to this phenomenon I pose my second question thus. Fellas, is
159300	160300	it gay?
160300	164180	I'm sorry, who are you talking to?
164180	171220	Gentlemen of the Academy, did you get thrown out of Dairy Queen again? It must needs be
171220	172220	remarked.
172220	173220	Please stop breaking into my room.
173220	174220	I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
175120	176120	You don't want to enter my house?
176120	177560	I shall be the queen of dairy.
177560	183240	I'm sure you will be.
183240	184340	Cross dresser!
184340	185340	Hi!
185340	186340	I'm Natalie Wynn.
186340	188060	Biological woman.
188060	191080	Can't we pan the camera down?
191080	194700	My hair is less high?
196040	197300	Are traps gay?
197300	199100	The meme that will not die.
199100	204180	Originating around 15 years ago on 4chan, the word trap refers to either a male crossdresser
204220	206720	or a trans woman, especially in a context
206720	208680	of neotenous kawaii decadence.
208680	212020	The meme, are traps gay, is a mostly jokey debate
212020	214580	about the sexuality of men attracted to dick girls,
214580	216280	futanari, MTFs.
216280	218500	You know, a lot of these men don't know or care
218500	220000	about the difference between a trans woman
220000	222460	and a crossdresser, so it's kind of pointless
222460	223600	to get hung up on that.
223600	225900	The meme peaked in popularity about a year ago
225900	227660	when someone released the worst specimens
227660	229840	of the white race into the wild.
229840	231420	All traps gay.
231420	233280	One of life's most important questions.
233280	235040	Are traps gay?
235040	239600	Traps are gay, yes.
239600	243140	Will there be transsexuals in the ethnic state?
244940	245980	Hopefully not.
245980	247680	To the men who meme about this topic,
247680	249160	it's all lighthearted fun.
249160	250940	It's part of a wider game they like to play
250940	252040	called Is It Gay?
252040	254620	You know, is it gay to have an MMF threesome
254620	256180	only if the balls touch?
256180	257460	Don't cross the streams.
257460	258760	And so on.
258760	261780	But to many trans women, the meme and the word trap itself
261780	262940	are highly offensive.
262940	264900	In fact, last year when I first proposed
264900	266600	making a video about this topic,
266600	268680	many trans people on Twitter were outraged
268680	270080	because they felt that this topic
270080	272260	is just too harmful to even discuss.
272260	274620	So here's the challenge I face making this video.
274620	276700	On the one hand, there's people who are gonna be upset
276700	279480	and offended that I'm making a video about this topic at all.
279480	281380	And on the other hand, there are people who think
281380	283660	this is all just harmless otaku shit posting
283660	285840	and who are gonna be annoyed by my trigger warnings.
285840	288200	But first, to the people who think it's too offensive,
288200	289800	here's what I have to say for myself.
289800	292400	I've always believed that if you wanna persuade anyone,
292400	294040	it helps to meet them where they're at.
294040	297580	And in this case, rtrapsgay is where people are at.
297580	298740	At one of my YouTube meetups,
298740	300380	I met a high school teacher who told me
300380	302420	that he overheard some of his male students
302420	304740	joking in the hallway about rtrapsgay.
304740	307780	When those teenage boys go home and Google rtrapsgay,
307780	309380	who do you wanna explain it to them?
309380	312440	Your choices are Milo Yiannopoulos, this guy,
312440	315480	a Scottish hate crime convict named Count Dankula,
315480	316640	or this tran.
316640	318620	And at the risk of sounding arrogant,
318620	320220	I think it should be me.
320220	322200	You know, as trans women, we have little influence,
322200	323140	in society.
323140	324860	The people who lead the conversations about us
324860	326700	are bigger and stronger than we are,
326700	329200	so we're like a jogger racing against a car.
329200	331920	The only way to win is to hijack the car.
331920	336140	And so, this video is my attempt to hijack the conversation
336140	338580	that straight men are having about us.
338580	341960	As always, my aspiration is to derive a woke conclusion
341960	343200	from edgy premises,
343200	345740	to shitpost my way to the moral high ground.
345740	348700	Now, straight men, isn't all this offense taking
348700	350440	just more politically correct cuckoldry
350440	352200	designed to take away your free speech?
352200	354780	Well, I assure you, there will be no taking
354780	356300	of your free speech on this channel,
356300	358440	unless you clock my makeup, dickbag.
358440	359880	Comment deleted.
359880	362560	But, if you wanna know why trans women are offended
362560	365140	by Are Traps Gay?, I'm happy to tell you.
365140	366480	Not to silence you, of course,
366480	369760	but just in case you have the intellectual curiosity
369760	372800	to wanna know why someone different from you
372800	375560	might be hurt by something that seems harmless to you.
375560	379360	So, well, let's put it this way.
379360	381840	Two, trans panic.
382200	385360	The 1990 documentary, Paris is Burning,
385360	387860	depicts the ball culture of black and Latinx
387860	389980	gay and transgender people in New York City
389980	391480	in the late 1980s.
391480	393780	One of the main storylines follows a trans woman
393780	395600	named Venus Extravaganza,
395600	398920	who describes her precarious existence as a sex worker.
398920	402380	I was with a guy, and he was playing with my titties
402380	404440	till he touched me down there.
404440	407480	He felt it, and he seen it, and he like totally flipped out.
407480	409420	He said, you fucking faggot.
409420	410460	You're a freak.
410460	411880	You're a victim of AIDS,
411880	413200	and you're trying to give me AIDS.
413200	414060	What are you, crazy?
414060	414900	You're a homo.
414900	416000	I should kill you.
416000	419520	And like, I was really terrified,
419520	421560	so I just jumped out the window.
421560	423440	During the filming of Paris is Burning,
423440	426380	Venus was choked to death, presumably by a client.
426380	429320	Her body was discovered four days later under a hotel bed.
429320	430780	Trans women, in my country,
430780	432880	almost entirely trans women of color,
432880	435120	are murdered at a disgracefully high rate,
435120	437960	reaching a record of 29 deaths in 2017.
437960	440180	The men who murder trans women often claim
440180	441640	they were provoked to violence
441880	444020	by alleged deception of their victims.
444020	446540	This is what's called the trans panic defense
446540	447980	when legally invoked,
447980	450460	as in the 2004 trial of the killers
450460	452960	of the teenage trans girl, Gwen Araujo.
452960	454820	One of the killers, who had sex with Gwen
454820	456220	before learning she was trans,
456220	458360	cried, I can't be fucking gay,
458360	459920	before beating her to death.
459920	462440	Men are often willing to side with these killers,
462440	465000	saying that if trans women don't want to get murdered,
465000	466960	then they shouldn't trick men.
466960	468220	But what you have to understand is,
468220	471060	first, men usually do know when they're having sex
471060	471900	with a trans woman.
471900	473280	Like, if you have a dick,
473280	476040	it's pretty hard, actually, to have sex with someone
476040	477540	and have them not notice it.
477540	481260	And second, a lot of men view trans women's entire existence
481260	483240	as itself a kind of trickery.
483240	485240	A black trans woman named Elan Nettles
485240	487140	was murdered in Harlem in 2013
487140	490300	by a man whose friends had mocked him for flirting with her.
490300	492060	All she did to provoke him
492060	494640	was walk down the street with two friends.
494640	496940	The common thread here is not deception
496940	498300	on the part of the victims,
498300	500960	but rather the drive of the killers to protect
500960	503640	their social standing as masculine and straight.
503640	506720	But being perceived as a kind of fraudulent lure
506720	509500	is something that many trans women across class and race
509500	511160	experience some version of,
511160	516000	because men view femininity itself as a kind of enticement,
516000	519920	as the orchidaceous invitation to a proboscis.
519920	522200	I was just reading a Twitter thread by a trans woman
522200	524760	who was attacked recently by a man at a bar
524760	526060	who started flirting with her
526060	529000	until he realized she was trans and then punched her.
529000	530060	Like, what was she supposed to do
530060	530940	to stop that from happening?
530940	532380	Just stay at home?
532380	535420	For trans women, fears about men retaliating against us
535420	537620	for existing actually limit our freedom.
537620	539100	There's bars I won't go into
539100	542100	because I don't trust the clientele to side with me
542100	544160	if some shit like that goes down.
544160	545620	And I've had little scares.
545620	547120	I was in the back of an Uber once
547120	549540	and the driver comes on a little flirty, you know,
549540	550560	what's your name?
550560	551560	Are you a student?
551560	552980	And I'm thinking, wow,
552980	555420	he thinks I'm young enough to be a student.
555420	557220	But at some point he goes silent
557220	559940	and suddenly I'm getting a very icy glare
559940	560660	in the rear view mirror.
560660	562660	Like, fucking clocked.
562660	564580	And for a second I'm like, fuck,
564580	566660	I'm gonna die in the back of this car.
566660	567940	And of course I didn't die.
567940	571200	The rest of the ride was quiet, but it was fine.
571200	572860	I mean, I'm gonna be fine
572860	574780	because white middle-class transsexuals
574780	576220	don't get murdered in this country.
576220	578860	The murder issue exists at a specific intersection
578860	580400	of gender, class, and race.
580400	582520	And it's really not my oppression to claim.
582520	584840	You know, I sometimes hear white, bougie, middle-class,
584840	586880	computer programmer trans women be like,
586880	589380	we're getting murdered in the streets.
589380	590300	Who's we?
590300	592340	It's not white middle-class trans women.
592340	595400	So the trans panic murder issue is really not my lane.
595400	598360	It exists at this intersection of masculinity and race.
598360	600000	And it's really not a conversation
600000	601600	that should be led by a white woman,
601600	604960	especially when there's so, so, so many things
604960	607200	to critique about white masculinity.
607200	609540	Let's talk about some now.
609540	612020	Three, taking offense.
612020	613980	Okay, back to traps.
613980	615800	Now this is my lane.
615800	617900	I'm not sure anything's ever been more my lane.
617900	620100	Ah, the exquisite pleasure of being
620300	622320	entitled to the soapbox.
622320	625540	So boys, I've showed you how trans women's freedom
625540	628320	is abridged by our need to navigate around men
628320	629820	who view our gender presentation,
629820	633440	in fact, our very existence, as a kind of trap.
633440	635440	I think it should therefore be pretty clear
635440	637740	why trans women are not the biggest fans
637740	639140	of you using that word for us,
639140	641740	or for Fudanari, or cross-dressers, or whatever.
641740	644360	I mean, to be honest, if someone calls me a trap,
644360	646380	my response is more like, wow,
646380	648740	a transphobe thought I looked like a woman.
648740	650240	But that's because I'm so pathetic,
650240	652260	I have to go dumpster diving for validation.
652260	654100	But the rest of the trans women out there,
654100	656360	the ones with dignity and self-respect,
656360	658340	you should definitely not call them traps.
658340	660460	Of course, some trans women will overstate the case
660460	663140	and say the word trap is literally getting trans women killed,
663140	666180	which, I can't find any examples of the word trap
666180	667720	being connected to a murder,
667720	671540	but why don't we stop using the word before someone dies?
671540	674160	Because what you're doing when you call trans women traps
674160	675760	is you're showing that you think of us
675760	677180	the exact same way as the men
677180	679140	who try to justify attacking us.
679140	680960	When a man kills a trans woman,
680960	683240	literally the argument he trots out in court
683240	684540	is that he was trapped.
684540	686360	And that's what you're reminding us of
686360	687900	when you use that word.
687900	690340	And that's why trans women are getting triggered over it.
690340	692200	You know, sometimes people have good reasons
692200	693600	for being triggered by things,
693600	695640	and this is one of those times.
695640	698300	So, if I were a different kind of creator,
698300	699780	I could really end this video now.
699780	701860	I think I've made a pretty convincing case
701860	705120	that trans women are justifiably offended by the word trap.
705120	708020	But if I leave it at that, and this is for you, Twitter,
708020	710080	this is why I'm making this video.
710080	713300	If I simply argue that are traps gay is offensive,
713300	714600	then here's what happens.
714600	717260	First, a lot of people simply don't give a shit.
717260	718800	In fact, me telling them it's offensive
718800	720460	only makes them wanna say it more,
720460	722100	because they feel on a deep level
722100	724700	that they are by nature superior to trans people.
724700	726960	So an uppity telling them what words
726960	729320	they're allowed to say completely enrages them.
729320	731460	So they'll comment, traps are gay, lol,
731460	733780	just to reaffirm their superiority over me
733780	736100	and that I have no power or influence over them.
736100	738020	And there's really nothing I can do about those,
738020	738860	trans people.
738860	740980	But another group of people,
740980	742960	the socially progressive liberals,
742960	745860	they'll say, okay, so since you're offended by it,
745860	747520	I won't say the word trap anymore.
747520	749040	And they'll be super woke about it,
749040	750380	and they'll post Twitter call-outs
750380	752420	canceling anyone who uses the word trap,
752420	754820	and they'll be very respectful and compassionate
754820	756640	toward trans people in public,
756640	758960	so long as it makes them look good
758960	762020	to indulge and pity this tragic third-world country
762020	763060	of a gender minority.
763060	765360	But then they'll go home at night,
765360	768020	and in that twilight between consciousness and sleep,
768020	771980	their inner voice will whisper, but are traps gay?
771980	773580	And then, years later,
773580	776240	when their son brings home a transgender girlfriend,
776240	779140	we'll suddenly watch all that shallow wokeness vanish
779140	781280	like so much politically correct vapor.
781280	785200	Real acceptance has to be built on real understanding.
785200	786880	So it's not enough for me to argue
786880	789400	that are traps gay is offensive.
789400	794400	I also have to argue whether traps are gay.
794900	796860	So are traps gay?
796860	797860	Let's watch this.
797860	800220	Watch an instructional video to learn more.
816040	817840	Four, the philosopher.
819760	821020	Hello, boys.
821020	823960	It is I, the half-queen, points.
823960	826000	After 30 days and 30 nights,
826000	827860	the philosopher descended from the mountain
827860	830860	on top and to the gathered villagers thus spake.
830860	833460	Are traps gay, said he,
833460	836400	to whom the half-queen thus replied.
836400	837960	Hmm, let's see.
837960	839320	Let me think about it.
839320	840160	Oh.
842580	844040	I'm gonna stop saying trap now
844040	846640	because it's not a good word, as has been explained.
846640	848440	In fact, it's really best to treat it like a slur.
848440	851960	So what we're really asking here is if a man is attracted to
851960	854620	or has sex with a trans woman, is that gay?
854620	857800	Well, the simple answer is no, because trans women are,
857800	861200	and a man having sex with a woman is,
862300	865600	let's see here, according to the experts I've consulted,
865600	867140	it is not in fact gay.
867140	868800	But that's not the most persuasive answer
868800	870720	because in order to find it convincing,
870720	873600	you already have to believe that trans women are women.
873600	876520	And unfortunately, if you ask the average person about this,
876520	878040	what they say is something like,
878040	880740	sure, I think trans women are women,
880740	884680	but they shouldn't expect men to wanna date them
884680	887020	unless they're into that sort of thing.
887020	891560	Oh, and what sort of thing is that?
891560	893780	Usually when a man tells you he's dating a woman
893780	895240	and you say, oh, what's she like?
895240	897280	And he says, she's from Cincinnati,
897280	900640	your response is not, oh, David,
900640	904420	I didn't realize you were into that sort of thing.
904420	907360	In other words, these people tell you trans women are women,
907360	910220	but, and then they say something that shows
910220	913480	they don't really think trans women are women at all.
913480	916740	So since test audiences have proven shaky on that point,
916740	919640	it would basically be circular reasoning for me
919640	922560	to try to argue that attraction to trans women isn't gay
922560	924500	because trans women are women,
924500	926240	since the womanhood of trans women
926240	928800	is precisely the point that's being disputed.
928800	931160	So maybe the observational approach is better.
931160	933100	The facts are indisputable.
933100	935920	Many heterosexual men are attracted to trans women
935920	937940	and comparatively few gay men are.
937940	940680	Now to trans women, this is just an obvious fact
940680	942700	about our everyday experience in the world.
942700	945600	We know who's attracted to us and who isn't.
945600	946420	So to us,
946740	949580	this completely unnecessary debate is as impractical
949580	952400	as the question of whether the sun will rise tomorrow.
952400	954160	Sure, philosophers can say,
954160	957100	but how do we know the sun will rise tomorrow?
957100	960020	To which the correct response is shut the fuck up, nerd.
960020	962080	Stop playing 3D chess against your own brain
962080	963840	and find a real thing to worry about.
963840	965560	It's just a basic fact of experience
965560	967000	that the sun rises every morning.
967000	969920	And to trans women, it's a basic fact of experience
969920	971680	that the people who are attracted to us
971680	973900	are people who are attracted to women.
973900	975160	Of the cis men I've been with
975160	976740	since I started my transition,
976740	978400	all identify as straight
978400	980360	and all had only ever been with cis women
980360	982280	until this trend came along.
982280	984400	Am I really so powerful as a seductress
984400	986760	that lifetime heterosexuals are turning gay
986760	988340	over these tiny tits?
988340	990520	Let's not get cocky.
991520	994420	I mean, if a man is attracted to women and not to men
994420	995900	and he perceives me as a woman
995900	997620	and is attracted to me as a woman
997620	998780	and he sleeps with me
998780	1001000	and then he continues being attracted to women
1001000	1002240	and not to men,
1002240	1004680	in what world is that anything but a straight man?
1004680	1006580	What wild maze of reasoning do you have
1006580	1008900	to invent to argue that this man is really gay?
1008900	1011580	Well, we all know exactly how this maze of reasoning goes,
1011580	1013000	beginning with the obvious.
1013000	1015340	What about the penis?
1015340	1017480	Ah, yes, the penis.
1017480	1018920	Look, baby, we'll get to the penis.
1018920	1020300	Don't you worry about that.
1020300	1022000	But first, I should remind everyone
1022000	1025140	that a lot of trans women do in fact have vaginas
1025140	1026760	because they got five.
1026760	1027600	The surgery.
1030340	1031800	In fact, I've been thinking of signing up
1031800	1033120	for a vagina myself,
1033120	1035860	but the thing is I make too much money for Medicaid now,
1035860	1037680	so I have to form an LLC,
1037680	1040780	become my own employer so I can give myself health benefits,
1040780	1042620	and ugh, it's so much paperwork.
1042620	1044720	You have to become an unincorporated legal entity
1044720	1046640	in this country just to get a .
1046640	1048660	Of course, transphobic radical feminists will say
1048660	1050920	it's not a real vagina, just a fuckhole,
1050920	1053880	because a real vagina is a sacred passage.
1053880	1055080	And that's fine by me.
1055080	1057240	What am I gonna do with a sacred passage anyway?
1057240	1058680	Get fingered by the Pope?
1058680	1059520	Pass.
1059520	1061300	Straight men don't get hung up on this.
1061300	1063620	I guarantee you no straight man has ever thought
1063620	1065240	of a vagina as a sacred passage.
1065240	1066900	They're either grossed out by it
1066900	1068320	or they're trying to climb inside.
1068320	1070000	What I'm trying to say is in the past,
1070000	1072360	I've been a little uncertain about getting a vagina
1072360	1074520	because my genital dysphoria isn't that bad.
1074520	1077640	And besides, chicks with dicks are very in right now,
1077640	1079360	very 2019, very trending.
1079360	1080600	And being a dick girl,
1080600	1083000	it's kind of like being a legendary Pokemon, you know?
1083000	1085440	People take interest, people pay attention to you,
1085440	1086940	and isn't that what we all want?
1086940	1088280	But unfashionable though it is,
1088280	1091020	I do think I want the surgery because,
1091020	1094260	well, guys, can I confess something kind of dark to you?
1094260	1095140	I have this really, really, really, really, really,
1095140	1097280	really fucked up fetish
1097280	1101080	where I want a boy to put his penis in my vagina.
1101080	1102200	Crazy, right?
1102200	1103160	I mean, I like anal,
1103160	1105780	but the gross thing about anal is you have to eat well.
1105780	1107200	Ew, I don't want to eat well.
1107200	1109560	I want to shove garbage into my mouth hole and get dicked.
1109560	1110740	Is that a crime?
1110740	1112120	It is kind of a scary surgery though.
1112120	1113720	Like what if my vagina sucks?
1113720	1115440	I'm afraid I have some bad news.
1115440	1117360	The tests are back and are showing that
1117360	1121440	in the medical terminology, your vagina does indeed suck.
1121440	1124740	The point is the easy sell version of the argument I'm making
1124740	1127180	is that there's nothing homosexual about a man's attraction
1127180	1129860	to a trans woman who's been on hormones a couple years.
1129860	1132400	She has female skin, she smells like a woman,
1132400	1135140	she has breasts, she's giving hair, body, face,
1135140	1136980	she's post-op and has a vagina.
1136980	1139140	Now even in this situation, people will still say
1139140	1140960	it's gay because of the chromosomes.
1140960	1143500	But look, human beings have five senses
1143500	1145740	and none of them can detect chromosomes.
1145740	1147320	Sexual attraction is not based
1147320	1149440	on some chromosomal metaphysics of gender.
1149440	1150920	It's based on perception.
1150920	1153620	And if you're a man and you perceive someone as a woman
1153620	1154680	and you're attracted to her
1154680	1157580	as a woman, then you are having a heterosexual moment,
1157580	1158420	my dude.
1158420	1159900	Congratulations, you're a breeder.
1159900	1162420	Now the argument people make is, okay, fine.
1162420	1165600	It's straight if you mistake her for a biological woman.
1165600	1167940	But if you know she's a man and you're still attracted,
1167940	1170520	then it's gay.
1170520	1173040	So look, if you believe that trans women are men,
1173040	1175740	then that belief might interfere with your perceptions
1175740	1177380	and it might change the relationship
1177380	1179740	between your perceptions and your sexual response.
1179740	1182680	But more likely is that you still will feel attraction
1182680	1183800	to the trans woman.
1183800	1186560	Only if you value your identity as a straight man,
1186560	1188480	you'll feel ashamed of your attraction
1188480	1190040	and you'll try to fight and deny it.
1190040	1192040	And you'll probably end up treating trans women
1192040	1193520	like absolute garbage.
1193520	1196900	Now, if I wanted to make the SJW 101 type response here,
1196900	1198940	I would say trans women are women
1198940	1200780	because they identify as women.
1200780	1204280	And so every heterosexual man who's experiencing attraction
1204280	1206880	to a trans woman is necessarily experiencing
1206880	1209580	heterosexual attraction because of the way
1209580	1212380	the person he's attracted to identifies.
1212380	1213340	But that's just replacing the black and white male and female
1213340	1215720	with the black and white thinking of a biology dogma
1215720	1218220	with the black and white thinking of an identity dogma.
1218220	1220940	But human sexuality is not black and white.
1220940	1222480	It's not even shades of gray.
1222480	1224160	It's a multicolor acid trip.
1224160	1226500	It's centaur Donna Summer charging at you
1226500	1227620	with a spanking paddle.
1227620	1230340	So sexual attraction is not based on chromosomes,
1230340	1233760	but it's not usually based on psychological identity either.
1233760	1236140	Most of the time, initial attraction anyway
1236140	1238360	is based on what I'd call presentation,
1238360	1239640	how you look and act.
1239640	1241380	And I think that's especially true of men.
1241380	1243140	They get turned on by that initial visual pull,
1243140	1243980	pop.
1243980	1246280	They see, they conquer, they come.
1246280	1248040	I mean, you have to admire the simplicity of it.
1248040	1250260	Sometimes I wish I were a man.
1250260	1253500	So look, if what you want is a woman who pops,
1253500	1256240	then rest assured there are plenty of trans women who pop.
1256240	1257760	Maybe you don't think I pop,
1257760	1259180	but you'd be hard pressed to argue
1259180	1261420	that any number of trans models and actresses
1261420	1263840	don't pop as much as any cis woman pops.
1263840	1265380	So the pop is undeniable.
1265380	1266960	No one's questioning the pop.
1266960	1268120	In fact, without the pop,
1268120	1269300	it never would have occurred to men
1269300	1270860	to call trans women traps
1270860	1272380	because they wouldn't be trapped
1272380	1274700	if they weren't attracted in the first place.
1274700	1276700	But a lot of men seem to think that the pop,
1276700	1279100	the visual presentation of a trans woman,
1279100	1281260	is some kind of illusion or facade
1281260	1283040	that at some point will be dropped,
1283040	1285000	revealing that our womanhood is a sham
1285000	1286200	and that we're really men.
1286200	1287820	Now, here's a big difference
1287820	1290060	between dating a trans woman and dating a drag queen.
1290060	1291800	If you date a cis drag queen,
1291800	1294220	at some point, you're getting a man, honey,
1294220	1297260	as explained by the only good YouTuber, Jasmine Masters.
1297260	1299780	I don't wanna date nobody who wanna date me like this
1299780	1300800	because this comes off,
1300800	1302220	and you're not doing nothing with this.
1302220	1306180	But if you date me, there's no de-dragging.
1306180	1308160	There's no moment where I become a man.
1308160	1310700	Baby, what you see is what you got.
1310700	1311540	At least on this side.
1311540	1313040	This is my natural side,
1313040	1315820	and this is my biological side.
1315820	1317240	When we're discussing people who are trans,
1317240	1319060	we immediately say in the first paragraph trans woman
1319060	1321120	and then refer to them by their biological pronoun
1321120	1324020	because biology is the nature of the pronoun, so.
1324020	1325620	Everyone's always hating on trans women
1325620	1327740	for being stereotypically feminine,
1327740	1329480	so why do you think that in the bedroom
1329480	1330740	we'd be any other way?
1330740	1332140	Part of it is that people are really,
1332140	1334220	really ignorant about hormone replacement therapy
1334220	1335640	and what it does for trans women.
1335640	1337880	It feminizes our skin, our smell,
1337880	1339340	our body fat distribution.
1339340	1340860	It makes us grow breasts.
1340860	1343040	That's right, these are my very real,
1343040	1345100	very biological titties.
1345100	1346200	I mean, I'm wearing a push-up bra,
1346200	1347980	but at least there's something to push up now.
1347980	1349320	Here, I'll show you.
1351000	1351920	I mean, they're small,
1351920	1354260	but it's not by any measure a male chest,
1354260	1355940	and what I have is very real,
1355940	1358800	very biological, and very female.
1358800	1361420	You people think everything to do with trans women is fake,
1362140	1363920	it's fake boobs, fake hair,
1363920	1366000	but that's prejudice more than observation.
1366000	1367600	Like, I've noticed that whether or not
1367600	1369420	I actually wear a wig in a video
1369420	1372540	has exactly zero effect on how many people comment
1372540	1373880	to call me a man in a wig,
1373880	1375480	so I may as well just wear wigs,
1375480	1376860	and I may as well get my boobs done, too,
1376860	1378800	since people are gonna call them fake either way,
1378800	1380960	but for what it's worth, this is my real hair,
1380960	1383820	at least on this half, and these are my real boobs,
1383820	1386260	and if I bring home a gentleman or a lady,
1386260	1387760	all that stays on in bed,
1387760	1389420	and it's there when I wake up in the morning,
1389420	1391320	but what about the penis?
1391320	1392140	All right!
1392140	1395640	Look, if the penis is feminine, how is that gay?
1395640	1396520	I rest my case.
1396520	1397660	Roll credits.
1399500	1402800	You can't make me lose.
1402800	1405300	Six, the feminine penis.
1405300	1408380	Look, some guys want the Ts and the D,
1408380	1409480	and that's the T.
1409480	1412060	Now, a lot of people assume that the involvement of a dick,
1412060	1414620	even a lady dick, makes any sexual interaction
1414620	1417400	with a man gay, but isn't male homosexuality
1417400	1421000	usually understood as attraction to men,
1421000	1422120	and not merely to,
1422120	1425120	penises, wherever they may arise?
1425120	1426820	I think there probably are some gay men
1426820	1430160	who really just like dick, and I'm not judging.
1430160	1432300	I'm not here to attack anyone's preferences,
1432300	1433760	but being a straight man,
1433760	1435780	I don't really think that's best understood
1435780	1438100	as a man attracted to vaginas.
1438100	1439960	You call women pussy, but then you're always like,
1439960	1441400	ew, period.
1441400	1442500	I'm a straight man.
1442500	1444800	I'm not used to putting a towel down when I fuck.
1444800	1446020	I don't know how to use a condom
1446020	1448200	because I expect cis women to be on birth control
1448200	1449440	and do everything for me,
1449440	1450120	and then you have straight incels online calling libies,
1450120	1451120	and then you have straight incels online calling libies,
1451120	1452120	and then you have straight incels online calling libies,
1452120	1453260	and then you have straight incels online calling libies,
1453260	1455660	and generally putting on a show of vaginal disgust.
1455660	1457180	I mean, if you're gonna date cis women
1457180	1458580	or post-op trans women,
1458580	1459700	I think you owe it to them
1459700	1461740	to be a little more vagina positive.
1461740	1463020	Because even though straight men are like,
1463020	1464740	ew, dicks, that's gay,
1464740	1466920	you guys also kind of love dicks.
1466920	1468180	You're always drawing them.
1468180	1469860	Your buildings look like dicks.
1469860	1471500	Your porn all has dicks in it.
1471500	1473120	So what about dicks on chicks?
1473120	1475360	Well, men like chicks and men like dicks,
1475360	1477300	so what's the problem, officer?
1477300	1479640	I think the booming popularity of T-girl porn
1479640	1480520	speaks for itself.
1480520	1481560	On PornHub,
1481560	1484380	The shemale category contains more videos
1484380	1486100	than other such popular categories
1486100	1488840	as rough sex, orgy, and webcam,
1488840	1490900	and it's mostly straight men who watch it.
1490900	1493680	When adultempire.com moved their T-Girl content
1493680	1495500	from their gay site to their straight site,
1495500	1497120	views increased 50%.
1497120	1499840	In 2016, the same year North Carolina passed
1499840	1502560	a transphobic and discriminatory bathroom bill,
1502560	1504940	the adult site Game Link's top-selling titles
1504940	1508160	in North Carolina were My Transsexual Teacher,
1508160	1512780	Shemale Shenanigans, and Joey Silvera's Transvisions 6.
1512780	1514760	A lot of straight men first find out
1514760	1516360	about trans women through porn,
1516360	1518880	which isn't great since most T-Girl porn
1518880	1522200	is not transpositive and uses dehumanizing slurs
1522200	1523840	like shemale and tranny,
1523840	1525480	which is how you end up living in a country
1525480	1527480	full of people who will jerk off to you
1527480	1528960	but won't give you rights.
1528960	1532120	So to a lot of men, that's the representation we have.
1532120	1534480	Shemales, trannies, and Caitlyn Jenner.
1534480	1536280	Great, I love that for us.
1536280	1537800	Now there probably are some men
1537800	1540480	who will always be put off by a woman's having a dick,
1540480	1541560	and you know what?
1541560	1542620	That's fine.
1542620	1546660	Not every man can be a poet, a visionary, a sage.
1546660	1547840	You like what you like.
1547840	1549920	I'm not here to police anyone's desires.
1549920	1551040	In fact, quite the opposite.
1551040	1554120	I'm here to liberate men of sophisticated taste
1554120	1556360	from society's cruel and unjust prejudice
1556360	1558060	against their T-Girl-loving ways.
1558060	1560400	But liberation begins with understanding.
1560400	1562880	So who are the men who love trans girls?
1562880	1564820	Well, according to trans women I've talked to
1564820	1566640	in my own personal experience,
1566640	1567760	the men who date us can be
1567760	1569980	divided into three general groups.
1569980	1572720	Group one are men who, to be honest,
1572720	1575000	are actually kind of put off by the dick,
1575000	1577760	but they're so attracted to the woman it's attached to
1577760	1579040	that they're willing to work around it
1579040	1582020	or wait for it to grow on them.
1583160	1585640	Group two are men who are attracted to trans women
1585640	1587220	including their penises,
1587220	1589900	but they don't specifically fetishize the penis,
1589900	1591880	so they wouldn't mind if their trans lover
1591880	1594000	had genital reassignment and got a vagina.
1594000	1595280	And then group three are men
1595280	1597480	who specifically fetishize chicks with dicks,
1597480	1601220	and often want to worship the penis or be penetrated by it.
1601220	1604340	Now group three are what the trans community calls chasers.
1604340	1606480	Dating chasers is generally a bad idea
1606480	1607840	because their attraction to us
1607840	1610200	is based around fetishizing our genitals,
1610200	1611440	which is often the part of us
1611440	1613200	that we're most uncomfortable with.
1613200	1614760	So if you're a T-Girl who likes men,
1614760	1617140	group two is really Goldilocks perfection
1617140	1620220	unless you really like topping or you've had the surgery.
1620220	1621240	Now I should say that group two
1621240	1623020	does include some bisexual men,
1623020	1624720	and bisexual people of either gender
1624720	1626680	can be great partners if you're trans.
1626680	1628460	You like girls, you like dick.
1628460	1629680	I'm a girl with a dick.
1629680	1630800	Let's make this happen.
1630800	1633240	That said, if someone views that part of me as male
1633240	1635640	and wants me to do with it what men do with it,
1635640	1637240	then pass, not interested.
1637240	1638560	Now, you might be wondering,
1638560	1642380	what is this post-modern neo-Marxist SJW insanity?
1642380	1644660	How could I view it as anything other than a male part?
1644660	1645940	It's a fucking penis!
1645940	1647460	Well, I'm glad you asked.
1647460	1650560	I always jump at the opportunity to enlighten someone
1650560	1652960	about the ecstasies of the feminine penis.
1652960	1655880	You see, there are three factors that make a penis feminine.
1656680	1658500	Usage and physiology.
1658500	1660060	So first, context.
1660060	1662860	Picture in your mind's eye a feminine woman.
1662860	1664960	Now, picture her with a penis.
1664960	1667760	That's not a man's penis, that's a woman's penis.
1667760	1670760	It's feminine because of the context that it's in.
1670760	1672280	Second, usage.
1672280	1674460	A lesson in penis etiquette.
1674460	1677860	A gentleman need not be coy about his penis.
1677860	1680420	He may flaunt, he may brandish, he may tug,
1680420	1682860	he may penetrate, he may order you to get on your knees
1682860	1684280	like a good girl and .
1686680	1690240	As it is a truth universally acknowledged
1690240	1694760	that a lady of good breeding never brandishes her penis.
1694760	1696360	When she rises from the bath,
1696360	1699400	she covers it gracefully with a demure hand,
1699400	1703140	and when not in use, she keeps it carefully stowed away.
1703140	1706240	Here's how to tuck your penis like a lady.
1706240	1710800	The first step is to put on a set of vicious stiletto claws.
1710800	1712860	This doesn't make things any easier,
1712860	1714820	but it does build character.
1714820	1716660	Next, you want to take not one, but two, two, three, four,
1716660	1720100	but two pairs of cotton-lined, polyspandex,
1720100	1723700	bikini-cut panties, at least one size too small,
1723700	1725980	and pull them most of the way up your legs.
1725980	1729840	Now, there's just no way to put this delicately, my dears.
1729840	1731340	You're gonna take your claw,
1731340	1733220	and you're gonna grab your scrotum,
1733220	1735040	and you're gonna yank that bubble gum
1735040	1736380	back into your peach crease.
1736380	1738060	Now hold it back with one hand,
1738060	1740780	and with your other hand, push your penis back,
1740780	1743820	pressing those little legs up into your pelvis.
1743820	1746220	Bring your thighs together to hold everything in place,
1746220	1747900	and then pull your panties up.
1747900	1751060	Front first, then back, run your hand over it
1751060	1753400	to make sure nothing's seeping out the sides,
1753400	1756820	and then voila, it's like it was never there.
1756820	1758980	For more information, you can purchase my book,
1758980	1761100	Tuck Your Penis, with a new foreword
1761100	1762940	by Dr. Jordan B. Peterson.
1762940	1764720	I've now explained both the context
1764720	1766920	and the usage of the feminine penis,
1766920	1768980	so let us now turn to physiology.
1768980	1771640	Most people don't realize that taking feminizing hormones
1771640	1774240	actually changes the anatomy and functionality
1774240	1776100	of the genitals, shrinking everything
1776100	1778200	down and softening everything up.
1778200	1780540	That means changes to a little thing
1780540	1782480	not a lot of people are talking about,
1782480	1784920	but something I've been trying to raise awareness of,
1784920	1787920	you know, start a conversation, open a dialogue,
1787920	1792920	really get people talking about seven, the mouth feel.
1798180	1803180	Oh hi, it's me, Natalie Nguyen, your tasting specialist.
1803400	1805280	I have tasted everything.
1806100	1808840	Both the trans and the oral penis.
1808840	1811220	And I've been able to discover that this is almost
1811220	1814820	the same thing as the royal flush of oral sex.
1814820	1818200	Girl dick, boy dick, girl pussy,
1818200	1821660	and let us not forget about the masculine clitoris.
1821660	1825560	But today, we amuse the palate with the feminine penis.
1825560	1829160	Now, with respect to flavor, the feminine penis
1829160	1831880	has more sweetness than the masculine penis
1831880	1835880	and fewer truffle notes, while retaining the fundamental dick, umami.
1836100	1842220	To mouthfeel, the feminine penis is of course softer and smoother than the masculine penis
1842220	1844400	and does not become as turgid.
1844400	1851860	And as for the cum taste, well, it is a known fact that girl cum is clear, liquid, and tastes
1851860	1857880	of saline, whereas boy cum is milky, viscous, and more acidic.
1857880	1866020	It is therefore the consensus among sommeliers that sucking a female penis is not gay.
1866020	1867020	Cheers!
1874120	1877120	8. Being straight is pretty gay
1877120	1881880	So I've been trying to clear up some misconceptions about sex with trans women, but ultimately,
1881880	1886980	you kinda just need to try it yourself to fully, viscerally understand why sex with
1886980	1889380	a trans woman is sex with a woman.
1889380	1893900	Now, we must always be wary of being overly simplistic in our thinking.
1893900	1894900	Sexuality is complicated.
1894900	1895900	And while it's undeniable,
1895900	1902080	that many straight men are attracted to trans women, the messy reality is that a lot of
1902080	1905340	straight men are also attracted to male cross-dressers.
1905340	1909320	Before I transitioned, I was a cross-dresser, and I didn't present super womanly either,
1909320	1911680	like fully Dr. Frankenfurter.
1911680	1913300	And that's why I'm so iconic.
1913300	1918340	I showed the world that in two years, you can transition from literally Dr. Frankenfurter
1918340	1922020	to a very real, very biological drag queen.
1922020	1925000	But even when I was that baritone-voiced transvestite, I still got sex with a woman.
1925000	1928680	I still got semi-regular messages from men being like,
1928680	1934100	So, I'm a straight man, but I'm like, really attracted to you when you dress as a woman
1934100	1937120	and it's really making me question my sexuality.
1937120	1941620	Now, I could flatter myself with some kind of retcon and be like, well maybe those men
1941620	1946480	just picked up on my inherently womanly, female energy essence that I've always had since
1946480	1951500	I was born a female, biological soul trapped in the body of a cross-dressing baby.
1951500	1952500	But let's be real.
1952500	1954000	There are straight men who fuck cross-dressers.
1954000	1955000	There are straight men who fuck cross-dressers.
1955000	1957000	There are straight men who fuck drag queens.
1957000	1961760	There are straight-identifying men who fuck other straight-identifying men.
1961760	1963040	What is going on here?
1963040	1964040	Straight men, what is your deal?
1964040	1965040	Who are you?
1965040	1966040	What is your life?
1966040	1967040	How did you become straight?
1967040	1968180	Did they recruit you?
1968180	1969540	Were you groomed?
1969540	1970540	I blame the parents.
1970540	1974380	Let's go back to the game you guys like to play, the one I call, Is This Gay?
1974380	1979380	The commonly understood definition of homosexual acts is that they're sex acts between people
1979380	1980380	of the same gender.
1980380	1984760	But I've heard men argue that if a woman puts on a strap-on and pegs a guy, then that's gay.
1985000	1988660	Or that it's gay if a man enjoys a woman touching his nipples.
1988660	1993540	To be clear, we're talking about one man and one woman, Eve sucking Adam's nipples, and
1993540	1996020	according to these men, it's totally gay.
1996020	2001120	What that shows is that the idea of heterosexuality includes much more than just sex between a
2001120	2002180	man and a woman.
2002180	2006560	It actually encompasses a complex series of rituals that must be performed by people who
2006560	2008400	are playing the correct roles.
2008400	2012640	So if a man deviates from his assigned part in the approved bedroom activities, then according
2012640	2014760	to this very fragile view of heterosexuality,
2015000	2017060	he ceases to be straight.
2017060	2021400	Even a man's own relationship with his body is policed by these narrow confines.
2021400	2026580	For instance, some men won't even wash their own assholes for fear that some involuntary
2026580	2031560	twinge of anal pleasure might transform them irrevocably into raving homos.
2031560	2034920	I mean to be fair, before I washed my asshole, I was a quarterback.
2034920	2035920	Now I'm a cheerleader.
2035920	2039800	B-I-C-T-R-O, why don't tell the coach I was a guy?
2039800	2044440	This obsession with the details of what sex is allowed and what prohibited reminds me
2044440	2049320	of what psychologist Jonathan Haidt calls an ethics of purity and degradation.
2049320	2053260	Basically it's a style of moral thinking that treats the body like a temple that must
2053260	2057900	be protected from desecration, which means you have to obey laws about how you can fuck
2057900	2061680	and what you can eat, so for example religious dietary laws.
2061680	2067660	I think this hyper-masculine hetero-man code is basically an ethics of purity, a kind of
2067660	2072500	kosher law governing straightness, and the is this gay game is its theology.
2072500	2073600	Now this whole line of thinking has been reducing over the years.
2073600	2074300	I'm not sure if it's true or not.
2074300	2079180	It was introduced to absurdity pretty effectively by, of all people, Count Dankula.
2079180	2084860	If you class yourself as a straight man, and you're masturbating, that means that you're
2084860	2087420	touching a dick, and that's gay.
2087420	2090340	Well memed my lord, well memed.
2090340	2095620	The pinnacle of the whole conversation is reached when Dankula concludes that since a woman inherits
2095620	2101260	half her DNA from her father, she's technically half a man, and therefore having sex with a
2101260	2103840	woman is pretty gay.
2104300	2108940	Obviously this is shit-posting, but it's logically just as good an argument as traps
2108940	2110840	are gay because chromosomes.
2110840	2115140	So I think what we have here is a very bad theory about what it is to be gay.
2115140	2117360	So what is being gay?
2117360	2118360	Socrates.
2118360	2119360	Hmm.
2119360	2122400	On second thought, I don't know her.
2122400	2123400	9.
2123400	2125800	Being gay is good actually.
2125800	2129060	Sometimes when you've been arguing about something for more than half an hour, it's
2129060	2132540	good to take a step back and ask yourself, why are we even asking this question in the
2132540	2133540	first place?
2133540	2136820	Why does it even matter whether attraction to trans women is gay or straight?
2136820	2141660	It seems like the most pressing reason is that a lot of men equate straightness with
2141660	2145420	manhood, and they defend their manhood at all costs.
2145420	2149780	Now men, this might be difficult to hear, and maybe you don't want to hear it from me,
2149780	2154800	but this idea of manhood is hurting you, and it's hurting cis women, and it's hurting trans
2154800	2156860	women, and it's hurting gay people.
2156860	2159720	For one thing, it makes you really really bad at sex.
2159720	2162180	Who wants to sleep with a guy who is so hung up on homophobic paranoia that he can't even
2162180	2163180	have sex?
2163540	2165480	He can't even enjoy his own body.
2165480	2168380	Having your nipples sucked does not make you gay.
2168380	2170680	Being pegged does not make you gay.
2170680	2175260	Sucking another man's dick, just to try it, does not make you gay.
2175260	2176260	And why?
2176260	2181540	Because being gay is a socially constructed identity defined as a type of person who is
2181540	2184740	persistently attracted to people of the same gender.
2184740	2188480	If you're persistently attracted to people of the same gender, and you identify with
2188480	2190840	the word gay, then you're gay.
2190840	2191660	If not, then you're not.
2191660	2192660	And nothing you can do will change that.
2192660	2193160	9.
2193540	2194540	Being Gay
2194540	2198780	So that's one reason to stop worrying about this, and reason two is that being gay is
2198780	2199780	good actually.
2199780	2203220	I mean, why would you be worried about this if you didn't think being gay was bad?
2203220	2208060	Now, I don't identify as gay except in some pan-LGBT cultural sense.
2208060	2209060	We the gays.
2209060	2215240	But as a queer person, I can't help but be a little bit wounded by the fact that straight
2215240	2219200	men are so obsessed with proving that they aren't like us.
2219200	2222160	But that is not a wound I am going to dwell on.
2222160	2223480	Because life is much too short for that.
2223480	2227880	I don't want to waste any more time processing your homophobic baggage.
2227880	2228880	Are traps gay?
2228880	2229880	Baby, who cares?
2229880	2230880	Just do it feels good.
2230880	2236940	That's the simple answer, but the truth is that when people say, traps are gay but there's
2236940	2241600	nothing wrong with being gay, that is nothing but a sneaky attempt to call trans women men
2241600	2247240	and to reinforce the stigma against dating us among the group of people who are in fact
2247240	2248900	most attracted to us.
2248900	2252720	Because it is mostly straight men and not gay men who like us.
2252720	2257380	And the gay stigma is the reason why only a small fraction of the men who are attracted
2257380	2259980	to us are willing to openly date us.
2259980	2262020	And the stigma is very real.
2262020	2267080	A straight man who dates a trans woman takes on some of the burden of queerness.
2267080	2271960	Men who date us can be mocked by other men, they can be rejected by their families, they
2271960	2277200	experience, in short, a sample of the difficulty all queer people face.
2277200	2282120	But a real man, in my opinion, is not the kind of man who lets other people's prejudices
2282120	2284000	control his life.
2284000	2289900	A real man does not act like an insecure little boy afraid of what people will say about him.
2289900	2296000	A real man owns what he likes and is not ashamed of the women he loves.
2296000	2303800	And so, my edgy little boys, by that measure, I may be a woman, but I'm still more of a
2303800	2305060	man than you.
2312120	2315100	10.
2315100	2317000	I have feelings too.
2317000	2323640	Well, I guess today we learned that Are Traps Gay? is not a debate worth winning, because
2323640	2328740	just by participating, we're accepting the validity of an insincere question and the
2328740	2331160	bigoted assumptions it relies on.
2331160	2335500	Now, some harsh words have been said about men tonight, and I think that harshness is
2335500	2336500	deserved.
2336500	2337840	Hashtag not all gamers.
2337840	2341120	But also, this video completely centers men's feelings.
2341120	2342120	And if you want to know more, click here.
2342120	2344320	And I have feelings too, goddammit.
2344320	2349340	And some of those feelings are not all that different from the anxieties men have.
2349340	2352060	Let me explain.
2352060	2353060	Let me explain.
2353060	2358000	So I identify my sexuality as queer and poly, which in my case is politically correct terminology
2358000	2359920	for confused slutbag.
2359920	2364880	Before I transitioned, I dated women, and I still do have lesbicious and lesbinaical
2364880	2365880	feelings.
2365880	2370380	But early in my transition, I encountered a lot of TERF shit, and it really scared me
2370380	2371100	off dating cis lesbians.
2371100	2372100	Which I never did.
2372120	2373120	Which I never have.
2373120	2376740	Even before I transitioned, the question, do I want to fuck men, had been in the back
2376740	2378680	of my head for a long time.
2378680	2382160	But about a year ago, I was like, I want to fuck men.
2382160	2384240	I want to fuck men.
2384240	2388280	But when I first started messing around with men, I mean I was terrified.
2388280	2389280	Because men are scary.
2389280	2393360	And in my early transition, I'd only dated bisexual trans people and enbies.
2393360	2396780	And as an aside, some of those experiences were really revelatory.
2396780	2400040	A person with a vagina can be fully a man in bed.
2400040	2401280	That teaches you something about gender.
2401280	2401920	It might be hard to believe.
2402120	2403120	It might be hard to learn otherwise.
2403120	2409620	And loving a trans woman, like, I still sometimes do struggle to fully believe that I'm a real
2409620	2410620	woman.
2410620	2415380	But to experience another trans woman, not just as a woman, but as like the radiant model
2415380	2419340	of womanhood, that's an experience that's meant a lot to me.
2419340	2423680	And if you're attracted to women, and that's an experience you haven't had, you're missing
2423680	2424680	out.
2424680	2428160	But what I was going to say is bisexual trans and non-binary people are a pretty safe group
2428160	2430680	of people to date when you're early in transition.
2430680	2432120	Because they're pretty chill about anatomy.
2432120	2433120	And presentation.
2433120	2436960	But if you're going to date cishet men, you need to be serving women.
2436960	2439800	And I guess you don't need to, but it doesn't hurt.
2439800	2442000	And I did wonder if I was woman enough for it.
2442000	2446000	So the first couple of times I was so afraid, I was like, when I take my clothes off, is
2446000	2448280	he going to think I'm a man?
2448280	2450720	Basically my anxiety was, are traps gay?
2450720	2453360	But what I ended up doing is just working up to things gradually.
2453360	2455620	And of course, you start by sucking dick.
2455620	2460620	That's very safe, because like, what red blooded man is going to turn down a t-girl blowjob?
2460620	2461560	And it doesn't involve my dick.
2461560	2462080	It's not my dick.
2462120	2463120	It's not my junk in any way.
2463120	2467840	But then I got a little bolder, and I got with a guy who like, years before I transitioned,
2467840	2469460	we'd been guy friends.
2469460	2474120	So to then have a sexual experience where it was very much between a man and a woman,
2474120	2476300	like, that shit is super hot.
2476300	2480360	Recently I took what seemed like the biggest risk, and I let a straight guy go down on
2480360	2484960	me, and I was so nervous about that, because like, what if he thinks I'm a man?
2484960	2486360	What if he's repulsed?
2486360	2489500	Can you feel like a woman while your dick is being sucked?
2489500	2491360	The answer is yes.
2491360	2493680	It was so hot.
2493680	2494680	I loved it.
2494680	2495680	He loved it.
2495680	2501120	And just knowing that he'd never done that before, but I would just say it's special.
2501120	2502120	Ten out of ten.
2502120	2504740	And you know what he told me after?
2504740	2508800	He told me he liked the mouth feel.
2508800	2511360	Everyone's talking about it now, bitches.
2511360	2516560	So look, I really don't want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women,
2516560	2519360	because I mean, I was anxious too, in the other direction.
2519360	2520360	But I do want to shame men for being anxious about dating trans women, because I mean,
2520360	2521360	I was anxious too, in the other direction.
2521360	2524440	I do want to shame men for treating trans women like they're dirty little secrets.
2524440	2528780	And I do want to shame men for dehumanizing us and voting away our rights by day, while
2528780	2530980	jerking off to shemale porn by night.
2530980	2535020	And I do want to shame men for refusing to date us because they're not fucking strong
2535020	2540320	enough to shoulder one hundredth of the burden of stigma that every trans woman carries every
2540320	2541680	moment of every day.
2541680	2546140	And I do want to shame men for attacking their trans girlfriends because they couldn't
2546140	2549600	stand being treated like a gay man for five minutes.
2549600	2550600	That is pathetic.
2550600	2555480	If you're so worried about proving you're a man, why don't you start by standing up
2555480	2558780	for the women you love, you chicken shit cowards.
2558780	2561920	So look, what I'm asking for is so basic.
2561920	2563760	Don't call human beings traps.
2563760	2566720	If you're attracted to trans women, don't be ashamed of it.
2566720	2568640	It's okay, you can date us.
2568640	2570600	We're more than just jack off material.
2570600	2573920	If you aren't attracted to trans women, respect the people who are.
2573920	2577880	If you do date a trans woman, treat her like a princess, because god knows she's been
2577880	2578880	through enough shit.
2578880	2579880	And finally, protect her.
2579880	2583660	Protect trans women of color at all costs.
2583660	2586320	All I want here is basic human decency.
2586320	2588980	Is that really too much to ask?
2588980	2594860	Well, this is the internet, so yes, yes it is.
2594860	2596940	God damn it.
2596940	2601980	Well, that was long.
2601980	2609720	I suppose the lesson is, as Sigmund Freud said,
2609720	2615520	sometimes a cigar is just a beautiful woman's penis.
2615520	2633720	You must think that you are so unique, trying to educate all the free, blissfully,
2633720	2636720	unaware of how crude, hurt before, bigoted, and plain rude.
2636720	2637720	But you're not.
2637720	2638720	You're not.
2638720	2639720	You're not.
2639720	2653520	Oh my god, think about all the things that you have said to us.
2653520	2657200	All the things that you say come up everyday.
2657200	2664520	There is one thing that I cannot stand.
2664520	2665720	And it's you dear, head in the sand.
2665720	2666680	It's not really ignorance of mine.
2666680	2667680	It's the willful bigot's avocado.
2667680	2668680	Oh.
2668680	2675960	There is one thing that I cannot stand
2675960	2678720	And it's you, dear, head in the sand
2678720	2683340	There's no release from ignorance in my mind
2683340	2686520	Just the willful bigots who find us
2686520	2690240	Don't let them define us
