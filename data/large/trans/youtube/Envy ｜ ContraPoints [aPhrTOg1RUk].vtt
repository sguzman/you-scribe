00:00.000 --> 00:19.760
So, April 27, 2017 was the greatest day in the history of twitter.com.net.gov.

00:19.760 --> 00:26.000
I realize that to you children, Twitter is an app, but to us MILFs, it remains a website.

00:26.000 --> 00:30.240
You have to dial in.

00:30.240 --> 00:33.780
Hello operator, connect me to hell.

00:33.780 --> 00:41.240
This was the day that Fyre Festival, a luxury music event hosted by Ja Rule and some charlatan,

00:41.240 --> 00:45.100
was scheduled to begin on a private island in the Bahamas.

00:45.100 --> 00:49.620
There was a lot of hype, Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid endorsed the festival on Instagram,

00:49.620 --> 00:54.760
there was a promo video full of supermodels, tickets were selling for thousands of dollars.

00:54.760 --> 01:00.120
One Twitter thread summarized the marketing as exclusivity, conspicuous consumption, and

01:00.120 --> 01:06.260
many, many promises of excellent selfies for your already insufferable Instagram.

01:06.260 --> 01:12.220
So when the day arrived and the advertised best in food, art, music, and adventure turned

01:12.220 --> 01:17.460
out to be two slices of pallid American cheese languishing over sliced bread in an atmosphere

01:17.460 --> 01:22.260
that can only be described as muddy third world shantytown, I mean, if you weren't

01:22.260 --> 01:24.740
on Twitter that day, I don't think you can even imagine.

01:24.740 --> 01:27.160
The revelry.

01:27.160 --> 01:32.420
Just learned about Fyre Festival, aka Ja Rule's concentration camp for Instagram models

01:32.420 --> 01:33.800
and rich white kids.

01:33.800 --> 01:36.960
Yuppie Hunger Games hosted by Ja Rule.

01:36.960 --> 01:41.200
Finish your food, there's starving millennial influencers in Fyre Festival.

01:41.200 --> 01:45.400
Instagram entitled rich kids, meet Lord of the Flies.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.400
Let them eat salad.

01:47.400 --> 01:53.000
It was a shuddering climax of pent-up class rage.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.200
You know, maybe millennials couldn't get Bernie Sanders.

01:54.200 --> 01:59.220
But at least those sandwiches were garbage.

01:59.220 --> 02:08.180
Jamila Jameel is an English actress who's just extremely pretty.

02:08.180 --> 02:09.820
Imagine looking like this.

02:09.820 --> 02:10.820
Imagine being perfect.

02:10.820 --> 02:13.040
Why are you doing this to me, Jamila?

02:13.040 --> 02:15.560
Why are you doing this to women?

02:15.560 --> 02:20.620
One day on Instagram, an ordinary peasant told the queen, Jamila, your skin is so perfect,

02:20.620 --> 02:21.620
uwu.

02:21.620 --> 02:22.620
And Jamila replied,

02:22.620 --> 02:23.660
My skin is currently perfect.

02:23.660 --> 02:25.200
My skin is currently clear because

02:25.200 --> 02:32.260
A. Privileged people have more access to good quality nutrition and also our lives are significantly

02:32.260 --> 02:35.400
less stressful than those with less privilege.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.700
I also get to sleep more because of this.

02:37.700 --> 02:41.940
All of these things keep my hormones in balance and I'm able to address food intolerances

02:41.940 --> 02:42.940
easily.

02:42.940 --> 02:46.900
B. I believe that trans rights are human rights.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.660
C. I exfoliate twice a week.

02:49.660 --> 02:50.660
Oh boy.

02:50.660 --> 02:52.660
Jamila, they're gonna cut your head off, Gorge.

02:52.660 --> 02:53.660
I'll protect you, queen.

02:53.660 --> 02:56.100
Could she be any more annoying?

02:56.100 --> 02:58.940
Someone wandered on Twitter to 77,000 likes.

02:58.940 --> 03:03.200
This trend of fake self-awareness legit makes me want to rip my hair out.

03:03.200 --> 03:07.500
Now look, to be fair, everything Jamila said is true.

03:07.500 --> 03:12.040
Being privileged does make it easier to spend time and money on cosmetics.

03:12.040 --> 03:18.820
But Jamila's acknowledging this, this recitation of all the complex socioeconomic factors that

03:18.820 --> 03:21.660
account for why she's prettier than you, doesn't take any of the sting out of inequality.

03:21.660 --> 03:22.660
I'm not saying she's not pretty.

03:22.660 --> 03:23.660
I'm not saying she's not beautiful.

03:23.660 --> 03:24.660
I'm just saying she's got a lot of quality.

03:24.660 --> 03:25.660
Does it?

03:25.660 --> 03:30.400
And that's kind of at odds with what activists used to say, which is that you should check

03:30.400 --> 03:31.400
your privilege.

03:31.400 --> 03:36.140
A suggestion which the privileged seem to have taken to heart, since the rich and famous

03:36.140 --> 03:41.800
now go around delivering these orations on how fortunate they are compared to the rabble.

03:41.800 --> 03:46.100
And this of course turns out to be far more annoying than when they acted oblivious to

03:46.100 --> 03:47.100
it.

03:47.100 --> 03:48.100
I don't have any beauty secrets.

03:48.100 --> 03:51.100
I guess I just drink lots of water.

03:51.100 --> 03:52.660
Take me, mother.

03:52.660 --> 03:57.960
A similar scandal occurred when Kim Kardashian tweeted about her birthday party at the height

03:57.960 --> 04:00.160
of the coronavirus pandemic.

04:00.160 --> 04:03.280
Forty and feeling so humbled and blessed.

04:03.280 --> 04:07.380
There is not a single day that I take for granted, especially during these times when

04:07.380 --> 04:10.300
we are all reminded of the things that truly matter.

04:10.300 --> 04:15.200
After two weeks of multiple health screens and asking everyone to quarantine, I surprised

04:15.200 --> 04:19.760
my closest inner circle with a trip to a private island where we could pretend things were

04:19.760 --> 04:21.660
normal for just a brief moment in time.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.660
I realized that I was not alone.

04:22.660 --> 04:26.020
I realized that for most people, this is something that is so far out of reach right

04:26.020 --> 04:27.020
now.

04:27.020 --> 04:31.900
So in moments like these, I'm humbly reminded of how privileged my life is.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.160
Hashtag this is 40.

04:34.160 --> 04:35.580
Tag me, bitch.

04:35.580 --> 04:40.680
So like Jamila, Kim is attempting some kind of privilege checking maneuver.

04:40.680 --> 04:43.500
And once again, it has not gone well.

04:43.500 --> 04:49.160
You are the Marie Antoinette of the 21st century bragging about being humble and letting us

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
eat cake.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.080
Millions of Americans sick and suffering.

04:52.080 --> 04:58.700
Standing for hours in food lines and being evicted as you flaunt your wealth and privilege.

04:58.700 --> 05:04.400
Your tweet made ten times worse by hashtag tone deaf, humbled and blessed line, hashtag

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
gross.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.400
Happy birthday.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.400
Mmm.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.440
I hope somebody got you an alphabet book as a gift so you can read them motherfuckin'.

05:11.440 --> 05:16.800
So the response on Twitter resembles moral outrage, but what people were upset about

05:16.800 --> 05:18.440
was not that she had the party.

05:18.440 --> 05:21.440
I mean, wouldn't you escape to a private island if you got that MILF money?

05:21.440 --> 05:29.060
The problem was more that she tweeted about it, and that the tweet was maybe, just maybe,

05:29.060 --> 05:30.720
a little bit yikesy.

05:30.720 --> 05:35.740
But if having the party wasn't wrong, then why was tweeting about it wrong?

05:35.740 --> 05:37.400
This isn't a good look.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.900
We say bad optics.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.900
Not relatable.

05:41.900 --> 05:43.520
Relatable.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.160
Relatability is not a moral category.

05:46.160 --> 05:49.960
This is public relations, it's not ethics, and it definitely isn't socialism.

05:49.960 --> 05:50.960
Like, I'm pretty sure Karl Marx is a socialist.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.480
I'm pretty sure Karl Marx never said,

05:52.480 --> 05:57.200
The problem with the bourgeoisie is they are not relatable.

05:57.200 --> 06:00.560
They can't read the room and it isn't a good look.

06:00.560 --> 06:03.260
This should have stayed in the drafts.

06:03.260 --> 06:04.260
Hashtag tone deaf.

06:04.260 --> 06:09.520
Isn't the issue that, when Kim tweeted this, most people were trapped in quarantine?

06:09.520 --> 06:12.280
We didn't get to have birthday parties.

06:12.280 --> 06:16.000
Some people couldn't even travel to visit their dying relatives.

06:16.000 --> 06:20.580
So watching Kim get to travel and celebrate her birthday like normal was…

06:20.960 --> 06:22.580
painful.

06:22.580 --> 06:26.920
Pain at the good fortune of others is how Aristotle defined envy.

06:26.920 --> 06:33.840
And I think it's interesting that whenever social media erupts in outrage over luxury

06:33.840 --> 06:41.740
music festivals, or Kim K's birthday party, or Jameela Jamil's privileged pores, no

06:41.740 --> 06:43.640
one ever uses the word envy.

06:43.640 --> 06:49.360
It's like we're averting our eyes, avoiding confrontation with this dark aspect of our

06:49.360 --> 06:50.360
own psychology.

06:50.360 --> 06:54.860
So in this video, I want to take a long, hard look at envy.

06:54.860 --> 06:55.860
What is it?

06:55.860 --> 06:57.260
Where does it come from?

06:57.260 --> 07:00.020
And seriously, what is Jameela Jamil's skincare routine?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.480
Drop it in the comments, bestie!

07:01.480 --> 07:03.600
Okay, so what is envy?

07:03.600 --> 07:08.840
Pain at the good fortune of others is not a bad start, but there's more to it than that.

07:08.840 --> 07:15.220
Envy is a syndrome, a complex of poisonous thoughts and feelings about people who have

07:15.220 --> 07:17.980
what we want, but cannot get.

07:17.980 --> 07:19.980
It's not simply wanting what another person has.

07:19.980 --> 07:24.080
That's greed, which is a much more wholesome sin.

07:24.080 --> 07:29.340
Because simply wanting what someone has can inspire us, it can fuel our own ambition,

07:29.340 --> 07:32.020
it can even motivate us to improve ourselves.

07:32.020 --> 07:36.100
And sometimes people call that envy, but it's not really envy.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.420
It's emulation, or admiration.

07:38.420 --> 07:40.480
At worst, it's what the Bible calls coveting.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.480
It covets.

07:41.480 --> 07:47.480
Envy is something darker, it's not just wanting what someone has, it's begrudging

07:47.480 --> 07:48.820
them what they have.

07:48.820 --> 07:49.820
You might even hate the person.

07:49.820 --> 07:49.940
You might even hate the person.

07:49.940 --> 07:49.960
You might even hate the person.

07:49.980 --> 07:53.420
You might even hate the person you envy, and want them to lose what they have, to be

07:53.420 --> 07:59.660
humiliated and destroyed, even if their downfall doesn't benefit you in any way.

07:59.660 --> 08:04.520
Like Satan, who is willing to lose heaven just to spite God, according to the poet John

08:04.520 --> 08:05.520
Milfton.

08:05.520 --> 08:08.160
It's gonna be 90 minutes of MILF jokes, kids, so strap in.

08:08.160 --> 08:12.060
So envy is malicious, it's a force of destruction.

08:12.060 --> 08:18.420
For an example of the distinction between envy and emulation, think about incels, involuntary

08:18.420 --> 08:19.420
celibates.

08:19.420 --> 08:22.580
Men who can't get girlfriends and are bitter about it online.

08:22.580 --> 08:28.420
It was incels who contributed to our culture the concept of chads, that is beautiful, wealthy,

08:28.420 --> 08:29.900
masculine men.

08:29.900 --> 08:36.040
For incels, taking the red pill means buying into an ideology which says that women only

08:36.040 --> 08:41.880
want to date chads, or else they want to marry beta cucks just to take their beta bucks.

08:41.880 --> 08:45.220
Gas keep, gate boss, girl light.

08:45.220 --> 08:49.380
So if you're an incel, you can either go to the gym and try to become a chad, that's a

08:49.380 --> 08:54.700
bad emulation, the aspiration to attain what another person has, or, and this is the more

08:54.700 --> 09:00.360
popular option, you can take the black pill, which means believing that chadhood is genetically

09:00.360 --> 09:04.980
determined at birth, there is no hope, no woman will ever want you, and therefore happiness

09:04.980 --> 09:08.160
is impossible, you may as well lie down and rot.

09:08.160 --> 09:14.300
This mindset of resentment has inspired so many mass murders, there's an entire Wikipedia

09:14.300 --> 09:16.700
timeline dedicated to tracking them.

09:16.700 --> 09:17.380
And the essential motivation for this violence is...

09:17.380 --> 09:17.880
The black pill.

09:17.880 --> 09:18.380
The black pill.

09:18.380 --> 09:18.880
The black pill.

09:18.880 --> 09:19.380
The black pill.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.660
Inまり's day, one indication of it all, is, envy.

09:21.060 --> 09:22.500
The incels failed ambition.

09:22.500 --> 09:27.580
And sense of incurable, predestined inferiority turns venomous.

09:27.580 --> 09:33.580
The logic behind the violence is, if I can't get a girlfriend, if I can't get what I want,

09:33.740 --> 09:35.260
then no one can.

09:35.260 --> 09:37.160
In the words of a murderer.

09:37.160 --> 09:42.380
The day of retribution, is my attempt to destroy everything I cannot have."

09:42.600 --> 09:48.700
But most incels aren't murderers, most of the time envy is most harmful to the person

09:48.700 --> 09:49.200
who envies.

09:49.380 --> 09:54.080
The philosopher Max Scheler called it a self-poisoning of the mind.

09:54.500 --> 09:58.360
There's a Christian saying that envy is the only sin that gives no pleasure.

09:58.840 --> 10:00.560
Because the other sins are fun, right?

10:01.120 --> 10:02.960
Greed, gluttony, lust.

10:03.480 --> 10:05.120
That's what I call a good time.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.300
But envy is misery.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.360
Though I wouldn't go so far as to say it gives no pleasure.

10:10.680 --> 10:16.580
Fire Festival is an art installation where mediocre people realize what their lives would

10:16.580 --> 10:18.320
be like without rich parents.

10:18.320 --> 10:19.780
Parents, yes.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.760
Rich refugee crisis.

10:22.340 --> 10:25.360
We're living in a moment of growing inequality and resentment.

10:25.820 --> 10:26.620
Look around you.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.380
We've got the guillotine memes.

10:28.580 --> 10:31.240
We've got edgy teens tweeting eat the rich.

10:31.460 --> 10:32.580
And none of this is new.

10:32.960 --> 10:37.820
The slogan eat the rich actually originates with the philosopher of the French Revolution,

10:38.040 --> 10:40.420
Jacques Gabor, who supposedly said,

10:40.680 --> 10:46.820
When the people have no more to eat, they will eat the rich.

10:46.820 --> 10:47.640
And fair enough.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.300
It's a good source.

10:48.480 --> 10:48.980
It's a protein.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.320
But take it from me, kids.

10:50.320 --> 10:53.720
Cannibalism is one of those tricky things.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.360
It's hard to do just once.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.800
You develop a taste for it.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.700
It's like they say at NA meetings.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.000
Once you've wore, you just want more.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.100
Also, who counts as the rich?

11:03.100 --> 11:04.100
Am I the rich?

11:04.100 --> 11:08.300
I certainly hope so, because I want you to eat me.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.300
Stop it.

11:10.300 --> 11:11.500
See this is why I quit academia.

11:11.500 --> 11:14.840
If I was a professor, I'd have to behave myself.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.500
And I don't want to behave myself.

11:16.500 --> 11:17.500
I want to be bad.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.100
Do you want to be bad?

11:18.100 --> 11:19.300
Do you want to be bad with me?

11:19.300 --> 11:20.700
Let's be bad.

11:20.700 --> 11:46.860
So you might think that envy is simply the

11:46.860 --> 11:47.220
The rich.

11:47.220 --> 11:47.560
The rich.

11:47.560 --> 11:52.440
simply the product of inequality, and that societies that have more inequality have more

11:52.440 --> 11:57.320
envy. I used to assume that too, but the more I think about it, the more I realize that might not

11:57.320 --> 12:03.560
be true. Envy is a basic part of human nature. It exists in all societies and all economic systems,

12:03.560 --> 12:08.120
and it begins anytime two or more people start comparing themselves.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.760
Part 2. The Desire for Mommy's Milk

12:10.760 --> 12:19.640
According to Sigmund Freud, or as I call him, Daddy, the first stage of human development is

12:19.640 --> 12:25.560
the oral stage, in which the primary concern is oral gratification, which is of course provided

12:25.560 --> 12:30.040
by mommy milkies. Am I doing too much? I'll tone it down, just a little bit.

12:30.040 --> 12:34.680
So look, I get that a lot of people are skeptical about Freud, and it's true,

12:34.680 --> 12:40.600
he was a bit of a crackpot coke fiend who had some zany ideas. Like penis envy. Maybe there's

12:40.600 --> 12:40.740
truth to that, but I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't

12:40.740 --> 12:40.880
know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Hmm.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.260
Transgender men who experienced that. But I don't think it's a basic

12:44.260 --> 12:49.140
factor for the female condition. As for castration anxiety, is that a dare?

12:49.140 --> 12:52.900
Because I take that personally. I'm giving it very serious consideration, doctor,

12:52.900 --> 12:57.780
but I feel like even when Freud is wrong he's often at least onto something. Like,

12:57.780 --> 13:03.460
with the oedipus complex, it's not that you literally desire your mother right that would

13:03.460 --> 13:10.580
be weird, it's more that you desire an archetype. Mother. Right? Mommy. You guys get it. Gen Z

13:10.580 --> 13:15.360
tiktok lesbians get it they're the ones who got me started on this milf shit i'm a reverse socrates

13:15.360 --> 13:21.180
i've been corrupted by the young my innocent and delicate nature has been defiled so freud says

13:21.180 --> 13:26.900
that in the first two years of life libido is primarily focused on mommy's milk and it's also

13:26.900 --> 13:33.340
in this stage that envy first emerges so i was the oldest child in my family and i was less than two

13:33.340 --> 13:37.900
years old when my brother was born so i don't remember this because i was one year old but my

13:37.900 --> 13:44.040
family tells me that when my brother was born i was just insanely jealous oh and i guess now is a

13:44.040 --> 13:49.260
good time to discuss the difference between jealousy and envy scholars agree that there is a

13:49.260 --> 13:55.780
difference and usually and usually they describe the difference in one of two ways the first is

13:55.780 --> 14:00.740
that jealousy is defensive it's a kind of protectiveness over what is rightfully yours

14:00.740 --> 14:07.060
whereas envy is offensive it's resentment over what someone else has that you lack and the second

14:07.060 --> 14:07.880
difference is that

14:07.880 --> 14:13.220
envy is between two people the envier and the envied whereas jealousy typically involves three

14:13.220 --> 14:19.080
people as in romantic jealousy where you have the subject the romantic object and then the rival and

14:19.080 --> 14:24.020
the subject is jealous of the rival because they're protective of their relationship with the romantic

14:24.020 --> 14:29.340
object and that's also the dynamic of sibling rivalry just substituting the romantic object

14:29.340 --> 14:34.080
for mommy of course in ordinary english people are always going to say jealousy when they really mean

14:34.080 --> 14:37.860
envy probably because jealousy has less negative connotations

14:37.880 --> 14:42.880
and i think it's pointless to try to fight that like i wouldn't go around correcting people but

14:42.880 --> 14:48.800
just keep in mind that there is a difference so sibling rivalry is that envy or jealousy well i

14:48.800 --> 14:54.240
think it's both because initially you're defensive of your privileged only child relationship with

14:54.240 --> 15:00.160
your parents but a new baby often gets more attention at least in your paranoid toddler brain

15:00.160 --> 15:06.000
and you might be envious of that and in romantic jealousy you may also envy the rival if she has

15:06.000 --> 15:07.720
qualities that you wish you had

15:07.880 --> 15:13.200
you know young kids are little egotists who are very sensitive to when another child might be

15:13.200 --> 15:20.480
getting preferential treatment one of the favorite phrases of tiny babies is it's not fair it's not

15:21.040 --> 15:29.360
fair tell me about it bambino and i've got bad news life is not getting any more fair than this

15:29.360 --> 15:34.400
according to the bible one of the first events in human history is the story of cain

15:37.040 --> 15:37.680
i don't know why

15:37.880 --> 15:42.080
i said it in spanish i guess i just thought it would sound cool was i wrong

15:43.200 --> 15:49.920
it just sounds so much better than cain king and abel cain and abel god tells cain and abel

15:49.920 --> 15:57.440
each to make a sacrifice and then god prefers abel's you know because god loves meat then

15:57.440 --> 16:01.760
in an act of malicious envy toward abel in spite towards god the father

16:01.760 --> 16:07.600
kain kills his younger brother in my earliest memories of my brother i already loved him

16:07.880 --> 16:12.320
and i don't remember the envy so i guess i wasn't a cain cain

16:12.320 --> 16:16.320
so i must have somehow worked through this without resorting to murder

16:17.300 --> 16:23.900
freud says that the older sibling's envy of the younger leads to a recognition of impotence because

16:23.900 --> 16:29.940
at first you selfishly want to be the special most loved child but you see that your parents love

16:29.940 --> 16:35.340
your sibling just as much as you and you're powerless to do anything about it so your ambition

16:35.340 --> 16:42.460
to superiority fails and so you have no choice but to repress your ambition to superiority as well as

16:42.460 --> 16:49.340
your envy and the result of that repression is what we could call herd instinct solidarity this

16:49.340 --> 16:55.260
feeling of identifying with a group the equal siblings and as you get older the herd instinct

16:55.260 --> 17:01.980
evolves into feelings about justice duty community and equality but freud thought these feelings

17:01.980 --> 17:09.660
retain a vestige of repressed envy if i can't be the favorite if i can't have special privileges

17:10.380 --> 17:17.980
then no one can and from these observations freud made the generalization social justice means that

17:17.980 --> 17:26.140
we deny ourselves many things so that others may have to do without them as well okay so we don't

17:26.140 --> 17:31.900
want other people to have anything we can't have so we enviously insist on equality

17:31.980 --> 17:37.580
as a defense against the greater prosperity of others now i don't think i completely agree with

17:37.580 --> 17:42.220
that like i think freud is definitely onto something here but don't some of our community

17:42.220 --> 17:50.700
feelings also come from a place of genuine care for other people i cared for someone once

17:52.300 --> 18:01.340
wrong well we'll come back to that later let's put a pin in me for now a pin in it for now in order to

18:01.340 --> 18:01.900
make it work for you

18:01.980 --> 18:05.180
freud i mean let's put a pin in freud

18:06.700 --> 18:13.980
in a 1966 book titled envy a theory of social behavior the sociologist helmut shook argued

18:13.980 --> 18:18.860
that rather than being that is a very german name helmut shook it's putting me in a german mood

18:18.860 --> 18:25.980
sweetie hello myna liban hoyta gifts i know yes video i just get worse at german every year shook

18:25.980 --> 18:31.340
argued that rather than being the result of social or economic inequality envy is a universal across

18:31.340 --> 18:37.900
all human societies including very egalitarian ones for example in tribal and village cultures

18:37.900 --> 18:43.820
around the world there's often a concept of black magic or witchcraft which are thought to be used

18:43.820 --> 18:48.940
by envious people to bewitch the ones they envy you're probably familiar with the concept of the

18:48.940 --> 18:54.140
evil eye which originates in ancient greece or maybe even earlier than that cultures all over

18:54.140 --> 19:01.260
the world today understand the evil eye as a kind of curse cast by the malignant gaze of an enemy's

19:01.340 --> 19:05.660
envious person now you might be thinking that sounds superstitious but i actually think the

19:05.660 --> 19:12.140
concept of the evil eye reveals a more sophisticated awareness of envy and of the social danger that it

19:12.140 --> 19:17.580
poses you've probably seen these amulets around there's an emoji for them now which are supposed

19:17.580 --> 19:23.180
to protect against the evil eye it's called a nazar which comes from the arabic word for sight

19:23.180 --> 19:27.900
or surveillance similar to the origin of the english word envy which is the latin invidia

19:27.900 --> 19:31.260
which just means to look at so there's an agreement across the

19:31.340 --> 19:37.260
cultures that envy is related to sight the malevolent gaze the evil eye and these amulets

19:37.260 --> 19:42.540
show that a lot of people are afraid of being envied and want to protect themselves i was just

19:42.540 --> 19:47.420
watching this turkish youtube channel with an episode on the evil eye and the host explains

19:47.420 --> 19:54.860
that for muslims it's customary to say or god has willed it when admiring a person or object

19:54.860 --> 20:00.060
you know to avoid unintentionally cursing them i love that it's like no envy like no homo but no

20:01.340 --> 20:07.660
love the top comment on that video says you want to protect yourself from the evil green eye monster

20:07.660 --> 20:13.260
well don't tell others about your ideas goals or wishes don't be flaunting your accomplishments on

20:13.260 --> 20:19.660
social media or posting pictures of your children that's how you avoid being jinxed see this is where

20:19.660 --> 20:25.580
kim kardashian went wrong with her birthday post clearly no one in the kardashian cinematic universe

20:25.580 --> 20:29.660
has ever heard of the evil eye wait i thought these people were armenians why haven't they heard

20:29.660 --> 20:30.460
a thief oh

20:31.500 --> 20:37.820
okay never mind every piece of media they've ever produced is about flaunting an enviable lifestyle

20:37.820 --> 20:44.700
this is a particularly american thing most americans have no concept of the fear of envy

20:44.700 --> 20:49.500
like there's advertisements here that literally promise if you buy this exclusive

20:49.500 --> 20:55.980
luxury vibrator you'll be the envy of all your friends as if it's a good thing to be envied oh

20:55.980 --> 21:01.260
but it is not if people envy you they gossip about you right they seethe over your success

21:01.340 --> 21:07.500
and celebrate your misfortunes being envied is basically the opposite of being loved so why would

21:07.500 --> 21:12.700
anyone want to be envied well it's a contradiction of human nature on the one hand we need to be

21:12.700 --> 21:20.220
loved but then there's this other drive in us this like homeric striving for fame and glory and

21:20.220 --> 21:26.140
riches which is kind of in conflict with our need to be loved in a past gilded age there were stories

21:26.140 --> 21:29.500
like citizen kane and sunset boulevard which warned what a sad and lonely life would be like in the

21:29.500 --> 21:31.340
past gilded age there were stories like citizen kane and sunset boulevard which warned what a sad and

21:31.340 --> 21:35.380
lonely thing success can become.

21:35.380 --> 21:41.140
In ancient democratic Athens, there was a practice called ostracismos, which is the

21:41.140 --> 21:44.340
origin of the English word ostracism.

21:44.340 --> 21:48.460
Ostracism was a procedure where the Athenians would assemble, and each person would write

21:48.460 --> 21:54.140
the name of a person they wanted to ostracize on a pottery shard called an ostracon.

21:54.140 --> 21:58.740
And whoever got the most votes would simply be banished from the city for ten years, no

21:58.740 --> 21:59.740
questions asked.

21:59.740 --> 22:04.660
I love the ancient world, things were so direct.

22:04.660 --> 22:09.780
Often this was used to remove someone who was becoming too prominent or too arrogant

22:09.780 --> 22:10.980
or just annoying.

22:10.980 --> 22:14.880
According to Plutarch, I'm just going to read this from Wikipedia, in one anecdote

22:14.880 --> 22:21.920
about Aristides, known as Aristides the Just, who was ostracized in 482, an illiterate citizen

22:21.920 --> 22:26.940
not recognizing him came up to ask him to write the name Aristides on his ostracon.

22:26.940 --> 22:29.300
When Aristides asked why, the man replied,

22:29.300 --> 22:32.540
It was because he was sick of hearing him being called the Just.

22:32.540 --> 22:33.540
It's good!

22:33.540 --> 22:34.540
It's so good!

22:34.540 --> 22:39.180
See, this is why the idea of cancel culture is absurd.

22:39.180 --> 22:41.980
This has been going on since the dawn of civilization.

22:41.980 --> 22:47.200
People in most cultures, not all, but most cultures understand that being envied is a

22:47.200 --> 22:51.980
massive social liability, so it's best not to draw too much attention to yourself.

22:51.980 --> 22:56.460
According to a Tamil saying, the tree that bears fruit will be stoned.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.580
This is sometimes called Tall Poppy Syndrome.

22:58.580 --> 22:59.300
Tall Poppy Syndrome.

22:59.300 --> 23:01.940
Tallest poppies in the garden will be cut.

23:01.940 --> 23:07.800
Shook argues that the fear of envy is a major inhibiting force in many societies.

23:07.800 --> 23:12.820
In Haiti, G.E. Simpson found that a peasant will seek to disguise his true economic position

23:12.820 --> 23:16.920
by purchasing several smaller fields rather than one larger piece of land.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.420
For the same reason, he will not wear good clothes.

23:19.420 --> 23:24.300
He does this intentionally to protect himself against the envious black magic of his neighbors.

23:24.300 --> 23:28.300
Now this kind of thing is not unheard of in America, like I've known people from seriously

23:28.300 --> 23:29.300
wealthy families.

23:29.300 --> 23:35.220
They dress like gutter punks, like they're trying to pass as poor.

23:35.220 --> 23:40.940
But in general, Americans don't openly acknowledge fear of envy, in the way many other cultures

23:40.940 --> 23:41.940
do.

23:41.940 --> 23:42.940
And I don't think that's an accident.

23:42.940 --> 23:47.360
We're a nation of show-offs, and so the taboo against discussing envy is related to

23:47.360 --> 23:50.540
our whole national ethos of shoving our wealth in everyone's face.

23:50.540 --> 23:54.820
But though the fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely

23:54.820 --> 23:56.860
still there, only repressed.

23:56.860 --> 23:57.940
Confined to the realm of dreams and art.

23:57.940 --> 23:58.940
The fear of envy isn't widely talked about or admitted here, it's definitely still

23:58.940 --> 24:00.580
there, only repressed.

24:00.580 --> 24:08.500
In the movie Black Swan, Nina is a perfection-obsessed ballerina who achieves her dream of getting

24:08.500 --> 24:13.920
the lead role in Swan Lake, after which her life and mind are totally unraveled by fear

24:13.920 --> 24:15.180
of envy.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.220
Black magic, black swan.

24:17.220 --> 24:22.420
At first we see how Nina's success comes at the very real cost of being envied.

24:22.420 --> 24:27.900
By her ex-ballerina mother, by the other girls in the company, and by the former lead ballerina

24:27.900 --> 24:28.900
she's replaced.

24:28.940 --> 24:29.940
Did you suck his c**k?

24:29.940 --> 24:30.940
Not all of us have to.

24:30.940 --> 24:31.940
I love Winona Ryder so much.

24:31.940 --> 24:32.940
I love Natalie Portman so much.

24:32.940 --> 24:33.940
I love Mila Kunis so much.

24:33.940 --> 24:34.940
I just like women.

24:34.940 --> 24:35.940
Where's my shock wand?

24:35.940 --> 24:36.940
Stop it.

24:36.940 --> 24:37.940
Stop stanning.

24:37.940 --> 24:38.940
But reasonable fear of envy becomes paranoia, as Nina begins hallucinating black swan doppelgangers

24:38.940 --> 24:39.940
and is seduced by bisexual demon Mila Kunis, who's trying to steal her role.

24:39.940 --> 24:40.940
You gotta watch out for those bisexual demons.

24:40.940 --> 24:41.940
They'll getcha.

24:41.940 --> 24:42.940
Did you hear that?

24:42.940 --> 24:43.940
I don't.

24:43.940 --> 24:44.940
I don't.

24:44.940 --> 24:45.940
I don't.

24:45.940 --> 24:46.940
I don't.

24:46.940 --> 24:47.940
I don't.

24:47.940 --> 24:48.940
I don't.

24:48.940 --> 24:49.940
I don't.

24:49.940 --> 24:50.940
I don't.

24:50.940 --> 24:51.940
I don't.

24:51.940 --> 24:52.940
I don't.

24:52.940 --> 24:53.940
I don't.

24:53.940 --> 24:54.940
I don't.

24:54.940 --> 24:55.940
I don't.

24:55.940 --> 24:56.940
I don't.

24:56.940 --> 24:57.940
I don't.

24:57.940 --> 24:58.940
I don't.

24:58.940 --> 24:59.940
I don't.

24:59.940 --> 25:00.940
I don't.

25:00.940 --> 25:01.940
I don't.

25:01.940 --> 25:02.940
Stop.

25:02.940 --> 25:07.140
You could argue that Nina is actually suffering a kind of self-envy, where she envies the

25:07.140 --> 25:13.560
disinhibited, sexually liberated, corrupted part of herself that's capable of adult eroticism

25:13.560 --> 25:16.160
and also of dancing the black swan.

25:16.160 --> 25:21.020
So she imagines that part of herself as an envious rival who's trying to replace her.

25:21.020 --> 25:24.900
It's like her mind is split between two impulses.

25:24.900 --> 25:30.780
There's her dominant White Swan Impulse, which we could call the Squidward personality, perfectionistic

25:30.780 --> 25:35.240
and orderly, but reserved, priggish, stiff.

25:35.240 --> 25:40.520
And then there's her repressed Black Swan Impulse, which we could call the SpongeBob

25:40.520 --> 25:45.180
personality, intuitive, chaotic, ecstatic.

25:45.180 --> 25:51.300
In SpongeBob SquarePants, the character Squidward is fundamentally a figure of envy, stemming

25:51.300 --> 25:52.300
from failed ambition.

25:52.300 --> 25:56.480
Hello, you've reached the house of unrecognized talent.

25:56.480 --> 26:01.640
Squidward aspires to artistic achievement, but remains a mediocrity, partly because of

26:01.640 --> 26:05.760
his overly dry, doctrinaire attitude towards art.

26:05.760 --> 26:10.180
SpongeBob is Squidward's social equal, they're literally neighbors, and they both work the

26:10.180 --> 26:14.580
same fast food service job for the same exploitative capitalist.

26:14.580 --> 26:20.020
But SpongeBob is a Mozartian intuitive genius, who's able to transform the most mundane

26:20.020 --> 26:22.280
activities, glowing bubbles, flippin' bubbles, into the world of art.

26:22.280 --> 26:26.060
From flipping burgers, into a kind of aesthetic rapture.

26:26.060 --> 26:31.840
Squidward intensely envies SpongeBob's uninhibited joy and intuitive creativity, but he can't

26:31.840 --> 26:34.500
admit that envy to himself.

26:34.500 --> 26:40.240
So he convinces himself that what he's really feeling is contempt, snobbish disdain for

26:40.240 --> 26:42.660
SpongeBob's childish behavior.

26:42.660 --> 26:47.220
What the people want is culture, not dancing bubbles.

26:47.220 --> 26:50.520
Though deep down, Squidward really wants what SpongeBob has.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.520
It's beautiful!

26:51.520 --> 26:52.060
It's beautiful!

26:52.280 --> 26:54.800
Uh, I mean, uh.

26:54.800 --> 26:58.320
Which we see when he can't help himself from blowing bubbles, or when he trades away

26:58.320 --> 27:02.480
all of his possessions for the chewing gum wrapper that in SpongeBob's hands was a

27:02.480 --> 27:04.520
source of infinite entertainment.

27:04.520 --> 27:09.380
A lot of people my age who watched SpongeBob as a kid rewatch it now, and are horrified

27:09.380 --> 27:14.600
to discover that they identify with Squidward, whereas as children, they identified with

27:14.600 --> 27:15.600
SpongeBob.

27:15.600 --> 27:18.660
Well, you either die as SpongeBob, or you live long enough to see yourself become the

27:18.660 --> 27:19.660
Squidward.

27:19.660 --> 27:20.660
Future!

27:20.660 --> 27:21.520
And there's a lot more to it.

27:21.520 --> 27:26.840
And there's a pain in becoming Squidward, which is usually explained as the disappointing

27:26.840 --> 27:30.400
drudgery of adult life, or simply loss of childhood.

27:30.400 --> 27:35.840
I would argue that envy of childhood is the distinctive Squidwardian emotion.

27:35.840 --> 27:36.840
Squidwardian?

27:36.840 --> 27:37.840
Are we saying that word?

27:37.840 --> 27:40.260
Are we really saying that word out loud?

27:40.260 --> 27:41.920
To an audience of millions?

27:41.920 --> 27:42.920
Okay!

27:42.920 --> 27:48.520
It's basically the same dynamic as Salieri's envy of Mozart in Amadeus.

27:48.520 --> 27:49.520
Oh my god, the evil eye killed Mozart!

27:49.520 --> 27:50.520
Oh my god!

27:50.520 --> 27:51.520
Oh my god!

27:51.520 --> 27:52.520
It's the evil eye!

27:52.520 --> 27:53.520
You gotta watch out for that one, kids!

27:53.520 --> 27:57.680
If a mysterious stranger shows up on your doorstep at midnight asking you to compose

27:57.680 --> 28:01.420
a requiem math for your own father, just say no!

28:01.420 --> 28:07.540
So in SpongeMadeus Mozart pants, we have a diligent-tho-stuffy wannabe envying the effortless

28:07.540 --> 28:10.220
playfulness of the spontaneous genius.

28:10.220 --> 28:11.220
Ah!

28:11.220 --> 28:12.220
Ah!

28:12.220 --> 28:13.220
Ah!

28:13.220 --> 28:14.220
Ah!

28:14.220 --> 28:15.220
Ah!

28:15.220 --> 28:16.220
Ah!

28:16.220 --> 28:17.220
Ah!

28:17.220 --> 28:18.220
Ah!

28:18.220 --> 28:19.220
Ah!

28:19.220 --> 28:20.220
Ah!

28:20.220 --> 28:28.000
So Squidward's envy of SpongeBob is, well, it's Apollo's envy of Dionysus.

28:28.200 --> 28:32.380
Look, if we were to view SpongeBob SquarePants through the philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche,

28:32.520 --> 28:34.300
stay with me ladies, I have an angle here,

28:34.420 --> 28:38.480
we could say that Squidward represents what Nietzsche called the Apollonian impulse,

28:38.480 --> 28:41.320
while SpongeBob represents the Dionysian.

28:41.640 --> 28:46.300
Nietzsche thought there were two conflicting artistic drives in the human personality.

28:46.300 --> 28:50.840
The Apollonian, named after the Greek god Apollo, is the drive towards self-control,

28:51.260 --> 28:53.360
order, logic, morality.

28:53.880 --> 28:59.900
And the Dionysian, named after Dionysus, is the drive toward intoxication, frenzy, passion,

29:00.120 --> 29:00.600
intuition.

29:01.080 --> 29:05.520
Both SpongeBob and Amadeus present these two drives in conflict,

29:05.520 --> 29:09.020
with the Apollonian envying the Dionysian.

29:09.440 --> 29:13.260
Of course, this is a misrepresentation of how art is actually created,

29:13.620 --> 29:16.280
because Nietzsche's whole point is that you need a balance

29:16.280 --> 29:17.400
of the two drives.

29:17.640 --> 29:21.780
In reality, you cannot have a pure Dionysian artist like SpongeBob,

29:22.120 --> 29:26.740
because creating good art requires at least some level of discipline in ordering.

29:27.100 --> 29:29.120
See? It is all in the technique.

29:29.340 --> 29:31.480
Otherwise, you're just some drunk idiot with a guitar.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.120
Get off the stage!

29:33.240 --> 29:36.520
So Black Swan is, in a way, actually more realistic.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.920
In order to give the perfect performance,

29:39.380 --> 29:43.740
Mina has to unify her fragmented personality and dance both swans,

29:43.920 --> 29:46.220
resolving the envious rivalry between her

29:46.220 --> 29:48.220
and the two artistic impulses.

29:48.800 --> 29:49.800
It was perfect.

29:55.440 --> 29:59.920
Another movie about fear of envious ballerina doppelgangers

30:00.840 --> 30:01.840
Can you guess it?

30:01.840 --> 30:05.040
is Jordan Peele's 2019 horror film Us,

30:05.300 --> 30:10.800
which dramatizes the repressed economic guilt and fear of the American middle class.

30:11.040 --> 30:15.580
We meet the Wilsons, a moderately affluent family with a vacation house

30:15.580 --> 30:20.680
and a boat, along with the Tylers, a slightly better-off white family,

30:21.100 --> 30:22.460
whom the Wilsons envy.

30:22.800 --> 30:24.280
You saw their new car, right?

30:24.540 --> 30:25.240
You had to do it.

30:25.260 --> 30:27.660
You just had to get that thing to fuck with me, too.

30:27.660 --> 30:33.360
One night, the Wilsons' vacation home is invaded by a family of their own monstrous doppelgangers.

30:33.900 --> 30:36.320
Red, the only doppelganger who can speak,

30:36.720 --> 30:40.540
explains that her family is metaphysically tethered to the Wilsons,

30:41.040 --> 30:43.780
living wretched and destitute versions of their lives

30:43.780 --> 30:45.560
in a liminal backroom's office.

30:45.580 --> 30:46.220
Underworld.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.580
It's super-fucking-liminal.

30:47.580 --> 30:49.580
I'm on Ambien at an AA meeting.

30:49.580 --> 30:50.480
Not again.

30:50.480 --> 30:55.380
Once upon a time, there was a girl, and the girl had a shadow.

30:55.760 --> 30:58.760
The two were connected, tethered together.

30:59.500 --> 31:04.100
When the girl ate, her food was given to her warm and tasty.

31:04.540 --> 31:10.500
But when the shadow was hungry, she had to eat rabbit, raw and bloody.

31:11.020 --> 31:13.400
We later find out that all over the US,

31:13.400 --> 31:15.400
oh, US spells us,

31:15.580 --> 31:17.580
hey, that's the title of the movie.

31:17.580 --> 31:19.580
Ohhhh.

31:19.580 --> 31:23.580
The tethered have risen up to kill their privileged doppelgangers

31:23.580 --> 31:25.580
and to link arms across the country

31:25.580 --> 31:29.580
in a dark parody of the real-world 1986 homelessness fundraiser

31:29.580 --> 31:31.580
Hands Across America.

31:31.580 --> 31:37.580
So my reading of Us is that it's an expression of middle-class guilt about privilege

31:37.580 --> 31:39.580
and fear of envy.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.580
It's not a movie about the working class.

31:41.580 --> 31:43.580
If it was a movie about the working class,

31:43.580 --> 31:45.580
then the working class would be able to speak humanly.

31:45.580 --> 31:49.580
And would not be scary monsters who make animal sounds

31:49.580 --> 31:51.580
and stagger around like zombies.

31:51.580 --> 31:57.580
This is a movie about the anxious middle class's nightmare of the working class.

31:57.580 --> 32:03.580
Us represents in a self-aware way what other home invasion movies represent unconsciously.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.580
The fear of the envious poor.

32:05.580 --> 32:07.580
Of revolution.

32:07.580 --> 32:09.580
Of slave revolt.

32:09.580 --> 32:11.580
Tell me you did not just reference Home Alone.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.580
But Us diverges from other home invasion movies

32:13.580 --> 32:15.580
by not just being fearful about the underclass,

32:15.580 --> 32:17.580
but also guilty.

32:17.580 --> 32:19.580
The idea of the tethered underclass

32:19.580 --> 32:21.580
represents life as a zero-sum game

32:21.580 --> 32:23.580
where every moment of your happiness

32:23.580 --> 32:25.580
is bought with someone else's suffering.

32:25.580 --> 32:27.580
It's an incredibly guilty fantasy.

32:27.580 --> 32:29.580
An internalization of the black magic logic

32:29.580 --> 32:31.580
of people who blame their own misfortunes

32:31.580 --> 32:33.580
on the people they envy.

32:33.580 --> 32:35.580
As Shook puts it,

32:35.580 --> 32:37.580
my neighbor's harvest

32:37.580 --> 32:39.580
can only have turned out better than mine.

32:39.580 --> 32:41.580
And it's not just me.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.580
My neighbor's harvest

32:43.580 --> 32:45.580
can only have turned out better than mine.

32:45.580 --> 32:47.580
Because he has somehow succeeded in reducing mine by black magic.

32:47.580 --> 32:49.580
So the fear of envy

32:49.580 --> 32:51.580
and the guilt of success

32:51.580 --> 32:53.580
are repressed in American culture.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.580
But they still find expression in movies.

32:55.580 --> 32:57.580
Jordan Peele is kind of like the Charles Dickens

32:57.580 --> 32:59.580
of the 21st century.

32:59.580 --> 33:01.580
Us actually reminds me of A Christmas Carol.

33:01.580 --> 33:03.580
A story about the guilt of the rich

33:03.580 --> 33:05.580
if ever there was one.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.580
You know, Scrooge is visited by ghosts

33:07.580 --> 33:09.580
who show him how wretched and sad

33:09.580 --> 33:11.580
the lives of his employees are

33:11.580 --> 33:13.580
and how he'll die alone

33:13.580 --> 33:15.580
and hated by everyone

33:15.580 --> 33:17.580
and his funeral is only attended by businessmen

33:17.580 --> 33:19.580
on the condition that lunch is provided.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.580
Dickens was truly the master

33:21.580 --> 33:23.580
of scaring the rich straight.

33:23.580 --> 33:25.580
So maybe fear of envy

33:25.580 --> 33:27.580
can serve a softly regulatory function

33:27.580 --> 33:29.580
by motivating charity

33:29.580 --> 33:31.580
and generosity in the rich.

33:31.580 --> 33:33.580
But in general, I'm suspicious of envy

33:33.580 --> 33:35.580
as a motivation for politics.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.580
Because remember,

33:37.580 --> 33:39.580
the basic logic of envy is

33:39.580 --> 33:41.580
if I can't have it,

33:41.580 --> 33:43.580
I can't.

33:43.580 --> 33:45.580
Which is a purely negative, destructive

33:45.580 --> 33:47.580
style of thinking.

33:47.580 --> 33:49.580
It's taking privileges away

33:49.580 --> 33:51.580
not for the material benefit of the underprivileged

33:51.580 --> 33:53.580
but merely for the psychological satisfaction

33:53.580 --> 33:55.580
of the envious person.

33:55.580 --> 33:57.580
And that's even worse

33:57.580 --> 33:59.580
when you consider that envy is subjective.

33:59.580 --> 34:01.580
It doesn't necessarily target

34:01.580 --> 34:03.580
objective power and privilege.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.580
So envy in politics

34:05.580 --> 34:07.580
is not by any means

34:07.580 --> 34:09.580
relegated to the left.

34:09.580 --> 34:11.580
Conservative politics is brimming with envy.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.580
In the debate about forgiving student loan debt,

34:13.580 --> 34:15.580
you often hear people say

34:15.580 --> 34:17.580
I had to pay my student loans

34:17.580 --> 34:19.580
so they should too.

34:19.580 --> 34:21.580
Debt forgiveness is not fear.

34:21.580 --> 34:23.580
The logic here is

34:23.580 --> 34:25.580
since I didn't get my student debt forgiven,

34:25.580 --> 34:27.580
no one should.

34:27.580 --> 34:29.580
It's intergenerational envy.

34:29.580 --> 34:31.580
Which is a pretty common thing.

34:31.580 --> 34:33.580
Usually older generations

34:33.580 --> 34:35.580
envying the young.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.580
Kids these days have it so easy.

34:37.580 --> 34:39.580
When I was young, we ate nails for breakfast

34:39.580 --> 34:41.580
and sent text messages

34:41.580 --> 34:43.580
to the phone.

34:43.580 --> 34:45.580
The feeling is basically

34:45.580 --> 34:47.580
it's not fair that kids these days

34:47.580 --> 34:49.580
don't have to suffer like I suffered.

34:49.580 --> 34:51.580
Or think about the concept

34:51.580 --> 34:53.580
of a welfare queen

34:53.580 --> 34:55.580
which openly reeks of envy and white resentment.

34:55.580 --> 34:57.580
Or the way conservatives talk about immigration.

34:57.580 --> 34:59.580
It's all this envious suspicion

34:59.580 --> 35:01.580
about illegal immigrants

35:01.580 --> 35:03.580
sneaking in

35:03.580 --> 35:05.580
and getting government handouts

35:05.580 --> 35:07.580
without having to pay taxes.

35:07.580 --> 35:09.580
I had to work hard for my money

35:09.580 --> 35:11.580
so why should these people get a free ride?

35:11.580 --> 35:13.580
What is an illegal immigrant

35:13.580 --> 35:15.580
is actually like,

35:15.580 --> 35:17.580
except in the imagination

35:17.580 --> 35:19.580
of people who envy them.

35:19.580 --> 35:21.580
Envy is felt more intensely

35:21.580 --> 35:23.580
by prideful people.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.580
So it's especially sharp

35:25.580 --> 35:27.580
when it targets people

35:27.580 --> 35:29.580
who are supposed to be beneath you.

35:29.580 --> 35:31.580
The Jewish radical feminist

35:31.580 --> 35:33.580
Andrea Dworkin

35:33.580 --> 35:35.580
made what I think

35:35.580 --> 35:37.580
is a pretty compelling argument

35:37.580 --> 35:39.580
that both antisemitism

35:39.580 --> 35:41.580
and misogyny

35:41.580 --> 35:43.580
are the main protagonists

35:43.580 --> 35:45.580
of Tolstoy's story

35:45.580 --> 35:47.580
The Kreutzer Sonata

35:47.580 --> 35:49.580
who resents that women and Jews

35:49.580 --> 35:51.580
find a kind of paradoxical power

35:51.580 --> 35:53.580
in their own oppression.

35:53.580 --> 35:55.580
Just like the Jews

35:55.580 --> 35:57.580
as they pay us back for their oppression

35:57.580 --> 35:59.580
by financial domination

35:59.580 --> 36:01.580
so it is with women.

36:01.580 --> 36:03.580
Ah, you want us to be traitors only?

36:03.580 --> 36:05.580
Alright.

36:05.580 --> 36:07.580
As traitors we will dominate you,

36:07.580 --> 36:09.580
say the Jews.

36:09.580 --> 36:11.580
Ah, you want us to be merely objects of sensuality?

36:11.580 --> 36:13.580
This dominance of men by women

36:13.580 --> 36:15.580
is experienced by the men

36:15.580 --> 36:17.580
as real. Emotionally real.

36:17.580 --> 36:19.580
Sexually real. Psychologically real.

36:19.580 --> 36:21.580
It emerges as the reason

36:21.580 --> 36:23.580
for the wrath of the misogynist.

36:23.580 --> 36:25.580
The woman appears to control sex.

36:25.580 --> 36:27.580
The man needs it.

36:27.580 --> 36:29.580
This causes his rage

36:29.580 --> 36:31.580
at her perceived power over him.

36:31.580 --> 36:33.580
Women control access

36:33.580 --> 36:35.580
to what men want

36:35.580 --> 36:37.580
which gives women a kind of indirect power

36:37.580 --> 36:39.580
that some men envy.

36:39.580 --> 36:41.580
They envy the sexual power

36:41.580 --> 36:43.580
of women.

36:43.580 --> 36:45.580
It doesn't matter to the misogynist

36:45.580 --> 36:47.580
that, especially at the time

36:47.580 --> 36:49.580
Tolstoy was writing,

36:49.580 --> 36:51.580
women objectively have less power

36:51.580 --> 36:53.580
in society than men.

36:53.580 --> 36:55.580
He envies women because they have

36:55.580 --> 36:57.580
what he desires.

36:57.580 --> 36:59.580
Likewise, it didn't matter

36:59.580 --> 37:01.580
to Weimar anti-Semites

37:01.580 --> 37:03.580
that Jewish people were a marginalized minority.

37:03.580 --> 37:05.580
Anti-Semitism is often rooted

37:05.580 --> 37:07.580
in an envious obsession

37:07.580 --> 37:09.580
with the disproportionate influence

37:09.580 --> 37:11.580
and affluence of Jewish people.

37:11.580 --> 37:13.580
There are no differences between men

37:13.580 --> 37:15.580
which feed envy,

37:15.580 --> 37:17.580
but subjective perception,

37:17.580 --> 37:19.580
the optics of envy.

37:21.580 --> 37:23.580
Magic mirror

37:23.580 --> 37:25.580
on the wall,

37:25.580 --> 37:27.580
who's the cuntest of them all?

37:29.580 --> 37:31.580
Thou art

37:31.580 --> 37:33.580
cunt, my queen.

37:33.580 --> 37:35.580
But hold,

37:35.580 --> 37:37.580
a lovely maid

37:37.580 --> 37:39.580
I see.

37:39.580 --> 37:41.580
Oh yes,

37:41.580 --> 37:43.580
I see.

37:43.580 --> 37:45.580
What?

37:45.580 --> 37:47.580
In a way,

37:47.580 --> 37:49.580
I'm kind of just in the beginning

37:49.580 --> 37:51.580
of this whole transition,

37:51.580 --> 37:53.580
you know, like a young little girl

37:53.580 --> 37:55.580
going through all these things,

37:55.580 --> 37:57.580
having a sleepover with the girls.

37:57.580 --> 37:59.580
What do we do on a sleepover?

37:59.580 --> 38:01.580
Do we have like pillow fights

38:01.580 --> 38:03.580
and all that stuff?

38:03.580 --> 38:05.580
Alas,

38:05.580 --> 38:07.580
she is more cunt than thee.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.580
My pussy's stunting on the gram

38:09.580 --> 38:11.580
The classic 1937 Disney movie

38:11.580 --> 38:13.580
Snow White and the Wicked Milf

38:13.580 --> 38:15.580
is the story of a quote

38:15.580 --> 38:17.580
vain and wicked queen

38:17.580 --> 38:19.580
who obsessively envies the beauty

38:19.580 --> 38:21.580
of her own stepdaughter.

38:21.580 --> 38:23.580
Are you sure this one's for children?

38:23.580 --> 38:25.580
Every day the milf queen asks the mirror

38:25.580 --> 38:27.580
who's the fairest one of all

38:27.580 --> 38:29.580
and the mirror responds that the queen is the fairest

38:29.580 --> 38:31.580
till one day it says the stepdaughter

38:31.580 --> 38:33.580
Snow White is the fairest

38:33.580 --> 38:35.580
which sends the queen into an envious fury

38:35.580 --> 38:37.580
resulting in a series of bizarre murder attempts.

38:37.580 --> 38:39.580
So first of all,

38:39.580 --> 38:41.580
why don't we talk plot holes, ding?

38:41.580 --> 38:43.580
Are we really supposed to believe

38:43.580 --> 38:45.580
that this is more beautiful

38:45.580 --> 38:47.580
than this?

38:47.580 --> 38:49.580
Uh, ding!

38:49.580 --> 38:51.580
Isn't Snow White like 12 years old?

38:51.580 --> 38:53.580
What's going on, Walt?

38:53.580 --> 38:55.580
Why don't you take a seat?

38:55.580 --> 38:57.580
Maybe she's not 12, I don't know.

38:57.580 --> 38:59.580
It's hard to tell because she's constantly

38:59.580 --> 39:01.580
surrounded by manlets.

39:01.580 --> 39:03.580
But she's just so boring.

39:03.580 --> 39:05.580
And the queen is such a baddie.

39:05.580 --> 39:07.580
Step on my throat, mother.

39:07.580 --> 39:09.580
This is a horny video.

39:09.580 --> 39:11.580
I can feel the pulse back in my veins.

39:11.580 --> 39:13.580
So despite the injustice done

39:13.580 --> 39:15.580
to its lead milf,

39:15.580 --> 39:17.580
Snow White does illustrate some interesting things

39:17.580 --> 39:19.580
about envy.

39:19.580 --> 39:21.580
Once again, we have black magic and witchcraft

39:21.580 --> 39:23.580
as an expression of envy.

39:23.580 --> 39:25.580
We have the age difference,

39:25.580 --> 39:27.580
intergenerational envy,

39:27.580 --> 39:29.580
the envy of youth.

39:29.580 --> 39:31.580
It kind of reminds me of those millennial women

39:31.580 --> 39:33.580
who hit 30 and suddenly feel a need

39:33.580 --> 39:35.580
to rage against Gen Z.

39:35.580 --> 39:37.580
Pretty counterproductive since

39:37.580 --> 39:39.580
if you're worried about seeming old,

39:39.580 --> 39:41.580
it's probably not helping your case gorge.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.580
You might wonder if there's also jealousy

39:43.580 --> 39:45.580
involved with the evil queen.

39:45.580 --> 39:47.580
Like, is she worried that the king is gonna fall in love

39:47.580 --> 39:49.580
with his own daughter?

39:49.580 --> 39:51.580
Well, I don't think so.

39:51.580 --> 39:53.580
Because we never even see the king.

39:53.580 --> 39:55.580
The queen doesn't mention him.

39:55.580 --> 39:57.580
It's not about the king.

39:57.580 --> 39:59.580
So there's no romantic jealousy involved.

39:59.580 --> 40:01.580
It's just one woman envying another woman

40:01.580 --> 40:03.580
over beauty for its own sake.

40:03.580 --> 40:05.580
We stan a Bechdel test passing

40:05.580 --> 40:07.580
movie about women hating each other.

40:07.580 --> 40:09.580
Gatekeep? Gas Girl?

40:09.580 --> 40:11.580
Gas Keep? Light Boss?

40:11.580 --> 40:13.580
In fact, in the original Brothers Grimm version,

40:13.580 --> 40:15.580
the queen first tries killing Snow White

40:15.580 --> 40:17.580
with beauty accessories,

40:17.580 --> 40:19.580
poisoning a comb and lacing her to death

40:19.580 --> 40:21.580
with a corset.

40:21.580 --> 40:23.580
I wish I could die that way.

40:23.580 --> 40:25.580
What's really striking is the pure

40:25.580 --> 40:27.580
kamikaze malignity of it all.

40:27.580 --> 40:29.580
This queen, who we know

40:29.580 --> 40:31.580
is obsessed with her look,

40:31.580 --> 40:33.580
is willing to transform herself with witchcraft

40:33.580 --> 40:35.580
into an ugly old hag

40:35.580 --> 40:37.580
just to give Snow White

40:37.580 --> 40:39.580
the poisoned apple.

40:39.580 --> 40:41.580
Disguising herself as an old hag

40:41.580 --> 40:43.580
parallels Satan disguising himself as a serpent.

40:43.580 --> 40:45.580
I mean, you could actually argue

40:45.580 --> 40:47.580
that the queen is simply a persona of Satan.

40:47.580 --> 40:49.580
It's paradise lost all over again.

40:49.580 --> 40:51.580
Which also happens to be

40:51.580 --> 40:53.580
the title of my memoir.

40:53.580 --> 40:55.580
The queen is incredibly petty,

40:55.580 --> 40:57.580
because even according to the, again,

40:57.580 --> 40:59.580
wrong and tasteless mirror,

40:59.580 --> 41:01.580
she's still the second most beautiful woman

41:01.580 --> 41:03.580
in the world.

41:03.580 --> 41:05.580
How could someone so close to the top of the hierarchy

41:05.580 --> 41:07.580
still be consumed by envy?

41:07.580 --> 41:09.580
Well,

41:09.580 --> 41:11.580
basically, because that's how envy works.

41:11.580 --> 41:13.580
It's petty,

41:13.580 --> 41:15.580
it's subjective,

41:15.580 --> 41:17.580
and it's indifferent to the magnitude of the inequality

41:17.580 --> 41:19.580
or to the absolute

41:19.580 --> 41:21.580
position on the overall hierarchy.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.580
So you can be the second best in the world

41:23.580 --> 41:25.580
and still be

41:25.580 --> 41:27.580
obsessively envious of the one

41:27.580 --> 41:29.580
person who may barely even be above you.

41:29.580 --> 41:31.580
In fact, there's studies showing

41:31.580 --> 41:33.580
that Olympic silver medalists

41:33.580 --> 41:35.580
are actually less satisfied with their prize

41:35.580 --> 41:37.580
than bronze medalists.

41:37.580 --> 41:39.580
Probably because the bronze medalist is just happy

41:39.580 --> 41:41.580
to be on the podium at all,

41:41.580 --> 41:43.580
while the silver medalist is so close to first,

41:43.580 --> 41:45.580
they can't help but wonder

41:45.580 --> 41:47.580
what if?

41:47.580 --> 41:49.580
Humans form our sense of identity and self-worth

41:49.580 --> 41:51.580
not by comparing ourselves to any absolute

41:51.580 --> 41:53.580
standard, but by comparing ourselves

41:53.580 --> 41:55.580
to each other. And we're more likely

41:55.580 --> 41:57.580
to compare ourselves to the people who are around

41:57.580 --> 41:59.580
us than we are to people who are far away.

41:59.580 --> 42:01.580
We could call this

42:01.580 --> 42:03.580
the proximity effect of envy.

42:03.580 --> 42:05.580
We're more likely to envy people who are

42:05.580 --> 42:07.580
close to us, or similar to us.

42:07.580 --> 42:09.580
Especially people we're in competition with.

42:09.580 --> 42:11.580
That's why social media

42:11.580 --> 42:13.580
is such a nightmare. It's an incubator

42:13.580 --> 42:15.580
of envy, because it puts everyone

42:15.580 --> 42:17.580
next to everyone else.

42:17.580 --> 42:19.580
So we're all being compared, all in competition.

42:19.580 --> 42:21.580
And it can destroy your

42:21.580 --> 42:23.580
self-esteem, because you're comparing

42:23.580 --> 42:25.580
your actual life

42:25.580 --> 42:27.580
to these idealized images.

42:27.580 --> 42:29.580
And it also turns public figures into

42:29.580 --> 42:31.580
lightning rods for envy,

42:31.580 --> 42:33.580
because of the numeric visibility

42:33.580 --> 42:35.580
of popularity and success.

42:35.580 --> 42:37.580
It's a perverse consequence

42:37.580 --> 42:39.580
of the proximity effect that

42:39.580 --> 42:41.580
envy within an oppressed class

42:41.580 --> 42:43.580
is often more venomous and obsessive

42:43.580 --> 42:45.580
than envy for the oppressor.

42:45.580 --> 42:47.580
So for example, in Snow White

42:47.580 --> 42:49.580
and Black Swan,

42:49.580 --> 42:51.580
you have women envying other women.

42:51.580 --> 42:53.580
Because women are often in

42:53.580 --> 42:55.580
competition with each other.

42:55.580 --> 42:57.580
And I know it's kind of a misogynistic trope.

42:57.580 --> 42:59.580
In media, there's constant portrayals of

42:59.580 --> 43:01.580
vain and envious women.

43:01.580 --> 43:03.580
Jealous bitches fighting

43:03.580 --> 43:05.580
over men, over youth,

43:05.580 --> 43:07.580
over beauty.

43:07.580 --> 43:09.580
It's like drag queen femininity.

43:09.580 --> 43:11.580
It becomes her femininity.

43:11.580 --> 43:13.580
On guard!

43:13.580 --> 43:15.580
Bitch!

43:15.580 --> 43:17.580
So yeah, it's kind of a misogynistic trope.

43:17.580 --> 43:19.580
But...

43:19.580 --> 43:21.580
How do I put this delicately?

43:21.580 --> 43:23.580
Sometimes reality is misogynistic.

43:23.580 --> 43:25.580
Like when my eyelash won't stay glued on.

43:25.580 --> 43:27.580
The patriarchy's machinations

43:27.580 --> 43:29.580
are clearly to blame.

43:29.580 --> 43:31.580
In her 1976 essay, Trashing

43:31.580 --> 43:33.580
The Dark Side of Sisterhood,

43:33.580 --> 43:35.580
feminist Jo Freeman wrote about her ostracism

43:35.580 --> 43:37.580
from within the women's movement.

43:37.580 --> 43:39.580
I've been watching for years

43:39.580 --> 43:41.580
and I'm starting to say as the movement

43:41.580 --> 43:43.580
consciously destroys anyone within it

43:43.580 --> 43:45.580
who stands out in any way.

43:45.580 --> 43:47.580
And she quotes a speech by fellow feminist

43:47.580 --> 43:49.580
Anselma del Olio.

43:49.580 --> 43:51.580
And who do they attack?

43:51.580 --> 43:53.580
Achievement or accomplishment of any kind

43:53.580 --> 43:55.580
would seem to be the worst crime.

43:55.580 --> 43:57.580
Do anything that every other woman

43:57.580 --> 43:59.580
secretly or otherwise feels she could do

43:59.580 --> 44:01.580
just as well, and you're in for it.

44:01.580 --> 44:03.580
You are immediately labeled a thrill-seeking

44:03.580 --> 44:05.580
opportunist, a ruthless mercenary

44:05.580 --> 44:07.580
out to make her fame and fortune

44:07.580 --> 44:09.580
in the bodies of selfless sisters

44:09.580 --> 44:11.580
who have buried their abilities

44:11.580 --> 44:13.580
and sacrificed their ambitions

44:13.580 --> 44:15.580
for the greater glory of feminism.

44:15.580 --> 44:17.580
Freeman speculates.

44:17.580 --> 44:19.580
The primary reason there have been

44:19.580 --> 44:21.580
so few great women blank

44:21.580 --> 44:23.580
is not merely that greatness

44:23.580 --> 44:25.580
has been undeveloped

44:25.580 --> 44:27.580
or unrecognized, but that women

44:27.580 --> 44:29.580
exhibiting potential for achievement

44:29.580 --> 44:31.580
are punished by both women and men.

44:31.580 --> 44:33.580
The fear of success

44:33.580 --> 44:35.580
is quite rational when one knows

44:35.580 --> 44:37.580
that the consequence of achievement

44:37.580 --> 44:39.580
is hostility and not praise.

44:39.580 --> 44:41.580
So at no point in this essay

44:41.580 --> 44:43.580
does Jo Freeman use the word envy.

44:43.580 --> 44:45.580
But as usual, envy is right

44:45.580 --> 44:47.580
below the surface, causing

44:47.580 --> 44:49.580
all the trouble.

44:49.580 --> 44:51.580
So Freeman is describing

44:51.580 --> 44:53.580
how people from marginalized groups

44:53.580 --> 44:55.580
whose ambition raises them above

44:55.580 --> 44:57.580
the typical limits set by marginalization

44:57.580 --> 44:59.580
are often ostracized

44:59.580 --> 45:01.580
from their own communities.

45:01.580 --> 45:03.580
But she has no causal explanation

45:03.580 --> 45:05.580
for why this happens.

45:05.580 --> 45:07.580
I have an explanation. The explanation is envy.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.580
Women are more likely to envy other women.

45:09.580 --> 45:11.580
Trans women are more likely

45:11.580 --> 45:13.580
to envy other trans women.

45:13.580 --> 45:15.580
Oh god, am I really gonna go there?

45:15.580 --> 45:17.580
If we did this topic justice,

45:17.580 --> 45:19.580
this video would be nine centuries long.

45:19.580 --> 45:21.580
Angar!

45:21.580 --> 45:23.580
Bitch!

45:23.580 --> 45:25.580
A lot of people assume that trans women

45:25.580 --> 45:27.580
envy cis women. And there is some truth to that.

45:27.580 --> 45:29.580
There definitely was a time in my life

45:29.580 --> 45:31.580
when I used to envy cis women

45:31.580 --> 45:33.580
for being cis women.

45:33.580 --> 45:35.580
But now I kind of just don't even allow myself

45:35.580 --> 45:37.580
to have the thought,

45:37.580 --> 45:39.580
to be a cis woman.

45:39.580 --> 45:41.580
So in a way, because becoming a cis woman

45:41.580 --> 45:43.580
is impossible, it's unobtainable,

45:43.580 --> 45:45.580
I actually envy cis women less.

45:45.580 --> 45:47.580
So trans women are more likely

45:47.580 --> 45:49.580
to envy other trans women.

45:49.580 --> 45:51.580
Because of the proximity effect

45:51.580 --> 45:53.580
and because another trans woman

45:53.580 --> 45:55.580
represents an actual possibility

45:55.580 --> 45:57.580
of what I, a trans woman,

45:57.580 --> 45:59.580
could become.

45:59.580 --> 46:01.580
She's a standard to which I could

46:01.580 --> 46:03.580
plausibly compare myself.

46:03.580 --> 46:05.580
Here's a post someone made on my own fan subreddit.

46:05.580 --> 46:07.580
Am I the only one who finds it hard

46:07.580 --> 46:09.580
to watch trans creators?

46:09.580 --> 46:11.580
Before I realized I was a trans woman,

46:11.580 --> 46:13.580
I fucking loved people like ContraPoints,

46:13.580 --> 46:15.580
Nick Spears, and other trans creators.

46:15.580 --> 46:17.580
But ever since I realized I was trans,

46:17.580 --> 46:19.580
I just get this angry, resentful feeling

46:19.580 --> 46:21.580
in the pit of my stomach whenever I get recommended

46:21.580 --> 46:23.580
any of these videos.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.580
I seriously loved ContraPoints,

46:25.580 --> 46:27.580
but whenever I try to watch any of her videos,

46:27.580 --> 46:29.580
I just want to scream.

46:29.580 --> 46:31.580
I have this feeling toward passing trans people in general.

46:31.580 --> 46:33.580
I feel such hatred for them, and I don't know why.

46:33.580 --> 46:35.580
Am I just a toxic person?

46:35.580 --> 46:37.580
Well, sweetie, you're not a toxic person.

46:37.580 --> 46:39.580
At least not any worse than anyone else.

46:39.580 --> 46:41.580
It's just that human nature

46:41.580 --> 46:43.580
is a toxic person.

46:43.580 --> 46:45.580
And that angry, resentful feeling

46:45.580 --> 46:47.580
in the pit of your stomach

46:47.580 --> 46:49.580
that makes you want to scream

46:49.580 --> 46:51.580
and feel such a hatred has a name.

46:51.580 --> 46:53.580
And the name is Envy.

46:53.580 --> 46:55.580
I actually admire the person who wrote this post

46:55.580 --> 46:57.580
because they're doing the best that any of us

46:57.580 --> 46:59.580
can do, really,

46:59.580 --> 47:01.580
which is noticing the feeling

47:01.580 --> 47:03.580
without endorsing the feeling.

47:03.580 --> 47:05.580
I wish that more people could feel things

47:05.580 --> 47:07.580
without rushing to a rational,

47:07.580 --> 47:09.580
even if they don't want to.

47:09.580 --> 47:11.580
It isn't rationality itself,

47:11.580 --> 47:13.580
often simply the attempt to make our feelings contagious.

47:13.580 --> 47:15.580
Sometimes people have no self-awareness

47:15.580 --> 47:17.580
about it at all.

47:17.580 --> 47:19.580
For example, there's a certain kind of

47:19.580 --> 47:21.580
boomer transsexual who complains that

47:21.580 --> 47:23.580
when I transitioned,

47:23.580 --> 47:25.580
I had to go through rigorous medical gatekeeping,

47:25.580 --> 47:27.580
but kids these days just waltz on in

47:27.580 --> 47:29.580
and walk out with hormones.

47:29.580 --> 47:31.580
It's intergenerational envy,

47:31.580 --> 47:33.580
trans addition.

47:33.580 --> 47:35.580
It was hard for me, so it should be hard for everyone.

47:35.580 --> 47:37.580
Like the student debt-dippy.

47:37.580 --> 47:39.580
If I can't have it, no one can.

47:39.580 --> 47:41.580
And look, I do have sympathy

47:41.580 --> 47:43.580
and admiration for older trans people.

47:43.580 --> 47:45.580
Like, being trans in 2021

47:45.580 --> 47:47.580
is already the maximum

47:47.580 --> 47:49.580
level of adversity that I can handle.

47:49.580 --> 47:51.580
I cannot imagine how hard

47:51.580 --> 47:53.580
it was to do this in the 80s.

47:53.580 --> 47:55.580
However, the pain of envy

47:55.580 --> 47:57.580
is not a valid argument.

47:57.580 --> 47:59.580
Envy is not sacred rage.

47:59.580 --> 48:01.580
And the malignant demands of envious people

48:01.580 --> 48:03.580
should be ignored.

48:03.580 --> 48:05.580
God, this community.

48:05.580 --> 48:07.580
The constant competition.

48:07.580 --> 48:09.580
The cringing.

48:09.580 --> 48:11.580
It makes it really hard to get along with other trans people.

48:11.580 --> 48:13.580
Oh, speaking of which.

48:13.580 --> 48:15.580
Gay tangent, everybody. Gay tangent.

48:15.580 --> 48:17.580
Envy presents kind of a unique

48:17.580 --> 48:19.580
problem to same-sex attracted people.

48:19.580 --> 48:21.580
Because of the increased risk

48:21.580 --> 48:23.580
of envying the very people

48:23.580 --> 48:25.580
you're attracted to.

48:25.580 --> 48:27.580
I wanna the ones I envy.

48:27.580 --> 48:29.580
You know, it's the classic

48:29.580 --> 48:31.580
do I want you or do I want to be you

48:31.580 --> 48:33.580
problem. I've heard feminine queer

48:33.580 --> 48:35.580
women say they could never date another

48:35.580 --> 48:37.580
femme because they're worried

48:37.580 --> 48:39.580
they would just end up envying her.

48:39.580 --> 48:41.580
So dating masculine women solves that

48:41.580 --> 48:43.580
problem. Because having separate roles,

48:43.580 --> 48:45.580
separate aesthetics, separate

48:45.580 --> 48:47.580
categories helps to avert

48:47.580 --> 48:49.580
proximity envy between

48:49.580 --> 48:51.580
partners. Unfortunately,

48:51.580 --> 48:53.580
I am not that smart.

48:53.580 --> 48:55.580
Basically, I am attracted

48:55.580 --> 48:57.580
to femininity. But I also want to

48:57.580 --> 48:59.580
embody a kind of feminine archetype

48:59.580 --> 49:01.580
myself. I'm not masculine

49:01.580 --> 49:03.580
and I don't wanna be. You know, I used to think

49:03.580 --> 49:05.580
I'd only wanna date another trans woman

49:05.580 --> 49:07.580
because of the mutual understanding

49:07.580 --> 49:09.580
but I've kind of realized that at this point

49:09.580 --> 49:11.580
it may actually be more psychologically healthy

49:11.580 --> 49:13.580
for me to open up to dating cis women.

49:13.580 --> 49:15.580
I used to not wanna do that because I was

49:15.580 --> 49:17.580
afraid it would make me feel like a man. But at this point

49:17.580 --> 49:19.580
honestly, just

49:19.580 --> 49:21.580
be a man. Whatever.

49:21.580 --> 49:23.580
It's fine.

49:23.580 --> 49:25.580
As a drag queen once said,

49:25.580 --> 49:27.580
I'm more of a man than you'll ever be. I'm more of a woman

49:27.580 --> 49:29.580
than you'll ever have. Yes, glad.

49:29.580 --> 49:31.580
Can we get the tequila out of the frame please?

49:31.580 --> 49:33.580
I think at a distance

49:33.580 --> 49:35.580
it's okay to indulge the attraction

49:35.580 --> 49:37.580
emulation ambiguity. But if

49:37.580 --> 49:39.580
you wanna actually have a relationship with someone,

49:39.580 --> 49:41.580
you have to make up your mind

49:41.580 --> 49:43.580
that you desire this woman

49:43.580 --> 49:45.580
and you do not wanna be her.

49:45.580 --> 49:47.580
Because think about it from the other perspective.

49:47.580 --> 49:49.580
What could be less attractive

49:49.580 --> 49:51.580
than someone who literally wants

49:51.580 --> 49:53.580
to be you? Teacher,

49:53.580 --> 49:55.580
make her stop copying

49:55.580 --> 49:57.580
me. Like as much as I joke every

49:57.580 --> 49:59.580
episode about how Buffalo Bill

49:59.580 --> 50:01.580
is an iconic trans legend,

50:01.580 --> 50:03.580
you don't wanna date that bitch.

50:03.580 --> 50:05.580
Imagine trying to date Eve

50:05.580 --> 50:07.580
from All About Eve. Pass.

50:07.580 --> 50:09.580
Hard pass.

50:09.580 --> 50:11.580
So if you're a queer woman, or a queer anything honestly,

50:11.580 --> 50:13.580
and you find yourself envying your

50:13.580 --> 50:15.580
partner, my advice is

50:15.580 --> 50:17.580
stop overthinking a good situation.

50:17.580 --> 50:19.580
An enviable woman wanted to be with

50:19.580 --> 50:21.580
you. So sit back,

50:21.580 --> 50:23.580
relax, and enjoy

50:23.580 --> 50:25.580
the clout. I get it though.

50:25.580 --> 50:27.580
It's complicated.

50:27.580 --> 50:29.580
We're all supposed to proudly affirm what we

50:29.580 --> 50:31.580
truly desire, but how do you know

50:31.580 --> 50:33.580
what you truly desire? Do I want

50:33.580 --> 50:35.580
mommy? Or do I wanna

50:35.580 --> 50:37.580
be the mommy?

50:37.580 --> 50:39.580
Yes. Just yes.

50:39.580 --> 50:41.580
Anyway,

50:41.580 --> 50:43.580
let's go back to talking about Sigmund Freud.

50:43.580 --> 50:45.580
The mother half took over completely.

50:53.580 --> 50:55.580
Do I look okay? Is my head on

50:55.580 --> 50:57.580
straight? So,

50:57.580 --> 50:59.580
we keep running into this avoidance

50:59.580 --> 51:01.580
of the word envy.

51:01.580 --> 51:03.580
And people especially cannot seem

51:03.580 --> 51:05.580
to notice when they themselves are

51:05.580 --> 51:07.580
feeling envious. Like that person who

51:07.580 --> 51:09.580
was puzzled over the angry, resentful

51:09.580 --> 51:11.580
feeling in the pit of their stomach without

51:11.580 --> 51:13.580
being able to name what they were feeling.

51:13.580 --> 51:15.580
There's two reasons why people are usually in

51:15.580 --> 51:17.580
denial about their own envy. One is

51:17.580 --> 51:19.580
guilt, and the other is shame.

51:19.580 --> 51:21.580
Shame. Shame

51:21.580 --> 51:23.580
because admitting to yourself that you

51:23.580 --> 51:25.580
envy someone implies

51:25.580 --> 51:27.580
that you feel inferior to them,

51:27.580 --> 51:29.580
which is shameful. It wounds

51:29.580 --> 51:31.580
the ego. And guilt

51:31.580 --> 51:33.580
because envy is malicious.

51:33.580 --> 51:35.580
If you envy someone, you may feel angry

51:35.580 --> 51:37.580
and miserable about their success

51:37.580 --> 51:39.580
and good fortune, and you may wish

51:39.580 --> 51:41.580
to see them ruined or brought down.

51:41.580 --> 51:43.580
That's cruel and antisocial.

51:43.580 --> 51:45.580
It goes against most ideas

51:45.580 --> 51:47.580
of morality, and it's a thought that's

51:47.580 --> 51:49.580
usually not socially acceptable

51:49.580 --> 51:51.580
to admit. So envy is shameful,

51:51.580 --> 51:53.580
guilty,

51:53.580 --> 51:55.580
and socially unacceptable. And we

51:55.580 --> 51:57.580
deal with that by suppressing it

51:57.580 --> 51:59.580
from our awareness. But it is still

51:59.580 --> 52:01.580
there, and in order to maintain

52:01.580 --> 52:03.580
the denial, we have to convince ourselves

52:03.580 --> 52:05.580
that this angry, resentful

52:05.580 --> 52:07.580
feeling in the pit of our stomach

52:07.580 --> 52:09.580
is actually something else.

52:09.580 --> 52:11.580
Think about how in Spongebob,

52:11.580 --> 52:13.580
Squidward shows contempt for

52:13.580 --> 52:15.580
Spongebob's childishness

52:15.580 --> 52:17.580
for blowing bubbles, for having fun at

52:17.580 --> 52:19.580
work, when in fact,

52:19.580 --> 52:21.580
Squidward envies Spongebob's

52:21.580 --> 52:23.580
uninhibited joy and intuitive

52:23.580 --> 52:25.580
creativity. But he can't allow

52:25.580 --> 52:27.580
himself to have the thought that he

52:27.580 --> 52:29.580
envies Spongebob, because that would

52:29.580 --> 52:31.580
mean recognizing the intolerably

52:31.580 --> 52:33.580
shameful truth that he

52:33.580 --> 52:35.580
feels inferior to Spongebob.

52:35.580 --> 52:37.580
So what he does instead is

52:37.580 --> 52:39.580
convince himself that what he really is

52:39.580 --> 52:41.580
is a refined sophisticate

52:41.580 --> 52:43.580
scoffing at this childish

52:43.580 --> 52:45.580
fool.

52:49.580 --> 52:51.580
We could call this envy to

52:51.580 --> 52:53.580
contempt sublimation.

52:53.580 --> 52:55.580
Sublimation is a psychoanalytic

52:55.580 --> 52:57.580
term, which means that you transform

52:57.580 --> 52:59.580
an ego-wounding feeling

52:59.580 --> 53:01.580
or socially unacceptable longing

53:01.580 --> 53:03.580
into something more

53:03.580 --> 53:05.580
ego-flattering or socially acceptable.

53:05.580 --> 53:07.580
So the classic example used by Freud

53:07.580 --> 53:09.580
is the transformation of sexual

53:09.580 --> 53:11.580
urges of erotic

53:11.580 --> 53:13.580
energy into creative

53:13.580 --> 53:15.580
expression. It's like the founder of the

53:15.580 --> 53:17.580
NoFap movement, Lady Gaga,

53:17.580 --> 53:19.580
once said,

53:19.580 --> 53:21.580
I have this weird thing that if I sleep with someone,

53:21.580 --> 53:23.580
they're gonna take my creativity from me through my

53:23.580 --> 53:25.580
So according to Freud,

53:25.580 --> 53:27.580
the vast majority of erotic longings

53:27.580 --> 53:29.580
can never be fulfilled.

53:29.580 --> 53:31.580
Tell me about it, Sigmund. Ugh.

53:31.580 --> 53:33.580
Misery.

53:33.580 --> 53:35.580
There's a positive side to this, supposedly,

53:35.580 --> 53:37.580
which is that you can sublimate your

53:37.580 --> 53:39.580
erotic longings into a more

53:39.580 --> 53:41.580
socially acceptable productivity.

53:41.580 --> 53:43.580
So, you know, instead of slicking the bean,

53:43.580 --> 53:45.580
maybe you write novels

53:45.580 --> 53:47.580
about thirsty vampires, or

53:47.580 --> 53:49.580
for that matter, philosophical treatises

53:49.580 --> 53:51.580
about the will to power.

53:51.580 --> 53:53.580
Oh, we'll get to you. Freud thought that

53:53.580 --> 53:55.580
civilization itself is built at the cost

53:55.580 --> 53:57.580
of our instincts, most of which

53:57.580 --> 53:59.580
we have to sacrifice in order to

53:59.580 --> 54:01.580
live in a society. So like erotic

54:01.580 --> 54:03.580
impulses, I think envy can

54:03.580 --> 54:05.580
be sublimated, which is what's happening

54:05.580 --> 54:07.580
when it becomes contempt.

54:07.580 --> 54:09.580
Another example is the blog

54:09.580 --> 54:11.580
McMansion Hell, which makes fun of the

54:11.580 --> 54:13.580
tasteless architecture of suburban

54:13.580 --> 54:15.580
ostentatious trash.

54:15.580 --> 54:17.580
I would argue that part of the fun of this blog

54:17.580 --> 54:19.580
is the pleasure and relief

54:19.580 --> 54:21.580
of looking down

54:21.580 --> 54:23.580
at the rich.

54:23.580 --> 54:25.580
Because looking enviously up at the rich

54:25.580 --> 54:27.580
is painful. It makes you feel

54:27.580 --> 54:29.580
inferior. And a way to

54:29.580 --> 54:31.580
alleviate that pain is to sublimate

54:31.580 --> 54:33.580
envy, and pretend

54:33.580 --> 54:35.580
that you're an aristocratic

54:35.580 --> 54:37.580
esthete, scoffing at the vulgar

54:37.580 --> 54:39.580
taste of the Ereveste.

54:39.580 --> 54:41.580
These flying buttresses are an

54:41.580 --> 54:43.580
extremely poor taste.

54:43.580 --> 54:45.580
Another example is shit-talking

54:45.580 --> 54:47.580
plastic surgery. I once heard a

54:47.580 --> 54:49.580
trans woman say, at least I don't look

54:49.580 --> 54:51.580
like a botched sex doll.

54:51.580 --> 54:53.580
The subtext is, there's a certain kind of

54:53.580 --> 54:55.580
trans woman influencer who lives in LA

54:55.580 --> 54:57.580
and has a lot of cosmetic surgery

54:57.580 --> 54:59.580
to achieve a doll-like aesthetic.

54:59.580 --> 55:01.580
But it costs a lot of money to look

55:01.580 --> 55:03.580
like this. And a lot of trans women can't

55:03.580 --> 55:05.580
afford surgeries that they want.

55:05.580 --> 55:07.580
And one way to cope with frustrated

55:07.580 --> 55:09.580
desire is to convince yourself

55:09.580 --> 55:11.580
that the thing that's out of reach

55:11.580 --> 55:13.580
is not worth having anyway.

55:13.580 --> 55:15.580
See also the discourse on Twitter

55:15.580 --> 55:17.580
about how passing is transphobic.

55:17.580 --> 55:19.580
There's an ancient Greek fable where

55:19.580 --> 55:21.580
a fox wants some grapes, but he can't

55:21.580 --> 55:23.580
reach the vine. So he walks away bitterly

55:23.580 --> 55:25.580
and says, well the grapes are

55:25.580 --> 55:27.580
transphobic anyway. The cisgender

55:27.580 --> 55:29.580
version of this is maybe the not like

55:29.580 --> 55:31.580
other girls meme. Which is classic

55:31.580 --> 55:33.580
envy to contempt sublimation.

55:33.580 --> 55:35.580
The trope is usually that other

55:35.580 --> 55:37.580
girls are popular and slutty.

55:37.580 --> 55:39.580
They have fake tans and fake nails.

55:39.580 --> 55:41.580
They like partying and makeup

55:41.580 --> 55:43.580
and stupid music for idiots.

55:43.580 --> 55:45.580
But I'm quirky and real.

55:45.580 --> 55:47.580
I listen to Pink Floyd

55:47.580 --> 55:49.580
and read books and eat lots

55:49.580 --> 55:51.580
of pizza late at night.

55:51.580 --> 55:53.580
Alone and sad.

55:53.580 --> 55:55.580
There's usually a subtext of anxiety

55:55.580 --> 55:57.580
about inferiority. The other girls

55:57.580 --> 55:59.580
being more socially accepted,

55:59.580 --> 56:01.580
feminine, and put together.

56:01.580 --> 56:03.580
A lot of times the other girls

56:03.580 --> 56:05.580
don't even exist, right? They're a media

56:05.580 --> 56:07.580
construct of idealized womanhood.

56:07.580 --> 56:09.580
Like where are these other girls

56:09.580 --> 56:11.580
who've never eaten pizza and enjoy

56:11.580 --> 56:13.580
wearing makeup at 9am on a Saturday morning?

56:13.580 --> 56:15.580
Are they between the sofa cushions?

56:15.580 --> 56:17.580
Did you put them in with the other laundry?

56:17.580 --> 56:19.580
Are the other girls in the room with us

56:19.580 --> 56:21.580
right now? So the feeling of inferiority

56:21.580 --> 56:23.580
toward the other girls is

56:23.580 --> 56:25.580
reframed as a kind of contemptuous

56:25.580 --> 56:27.580
hipster superiority. Which is

56:27.580 --> 56:29.580
really just an ego defensive persona

56:29.580 --> 56:31.580
of resentment. Like Janice

56:31.580 --> 56:33.580
in Mean Girls. She's not even really a lesbian.

56:33.580 --> 56:35.580
She's Lebanese.

56:35.580 --> 56:37.580
Regina got confused.

56:37.580 --> 56:39.580
And then she dances with a boy at the end.

56:39.580 --> 56:41.580
And is readmitted into girlhood.

56:41.580 --> 56:43.580
Thank you for that Tina Fey, that's very helpful.

56:43.580 --> 56:45.580
Great.

56:45.580 --> 56:47.580
Another way we can reframe feelings of

56:47.580 --> 56:49.580
envious inferiority is by

56:49.580 --> 56:51.580
transforming them into moral

56:51.580 --> 56:53.580
superiority. Moral superiority

56:53.580 --> 56:55.580
often being the refuge

56:55.580 --> 56:57.580
of people with nothing better

56:57.580 --> 56:59.580
to feel superior about. We don't have to

56:59.580 --> 57:01.580
feel guilty or ashamed of envy

57:01.580 --> 57:03.580
if we convince ourselves that we're

57:03.580 --> 57:05.580
actually experiencing

57:05.580 --> 57:07.580
is justified, legitimate

57:07.580 --> 57:09.580
hatred. So for example,

57:09.580 --> 57:11.580
think of the morality around sexuality.

57:11.580 --> 57:13.580
Part 69

57:13.580 --> 57:15.580
Sluts. Yeah, what are you gonna do

57:15.580 --> 57:17.580
about it? Cancel me?

57:17.580 --> 57:19.580
On guard!

57:19.580 --> 57:21.580
Bitch! Why does everyone hate

57:21.580 --> 57:23.580
sluts so much? Sluts never did nothing

57:23.580 --> 57:25.580
wrong to nobody. Open sexual

57:25.580 --> 57:27.580
promiscuity is in a way analogous

57:27.580 --> 57:29.580
to opulence. You're conspicuously

57:29.580 --> 57:31.580
enjoying something that other

57:31.580 --> 57:33.580
people want, but may not be able

57:33.580 --> 57:35.580
to get. Many cultures have

57:35.580 --> 57:37.580
norms about modesty. For example,

57:37.580 --> 57:39.580
expecting women to cover their hair

57:39.580 --> 57:41.580
in public. This is usually explained

57:41.580 --> 57:43.580
as prophylaxis against male

57:43.580 --> 57:45.580
lust, but I wonder if it also

57:45.580 --> 57:47.580
serves to prevent a more

57:47.580 --> 57:49.580
generalized envy, which female

57:49.580 --> 57:51.580
beauty has a way of attracting.

57:51.580 --> 57:53.580
Men often slut shame

57:53.580 --> 57:55.580
because they want to control female sexuality.

57:55.580 --> 57:57.580
And by female sexuality,

57:57.580 --> 57:59.580
I do mean male sexuality.

57:59.580 --> 58:01.580
Because often what they're really struggling

58:01.580 --> 58:03.580
to control is their own

58:03.580 --> 58:05.580
desire. But slut shaming is also

58:05.580 --> 58:07.580
done pretty viciously by

58:07.580 --> 58:09.580
women to each other. And that's a

58:09.580 --> 58:11.580
complicated thing. It's more than just

58:11.580 --> 58:13.580
envy. Sometimes it comes from a sense that

58:13.580 --> 58:15.580
a woman who's having casual sex

58:15.580 --> 58:17.580
with a lot of men is compromising

58:17.580 --> 58:19.580
the collective sex withholding

58:19.580 --> 58:21.580
power of the group. Almost like

58:21.580 --> 58:23.580
she's crossing a picket line. But there's

58:23.580 --> 58:25.580
also sometimes a resentment

58:25.580 --> 58:27.580
that a woman who's showing skin

58:27.580 --> 58:29.580
is using her body to get

58:29.580 --> 58:31.580
unearned attention.

58:31.580 --> 58:33.580
And that smells like envy to me.

58:33.580 --> 58:35.580
I don't use my body to get attention.

58:35.580 --> 58:37.580
So no one should.

58:37.580 --> 58:39.580
The repressed feeling is

58:39.580 --> 58:41.580
maybe I'm a little jealous that she's

58:41.580 --> 58:43.580
getting all this attention by posting

58:43.580 --> 58:45.580
thirst traps. But you don't think that.

58:45.580 --> 58:47.580
You think, I

58:47.580 --> 58:49.580
am above this. Because I

58:49.580 --> 58:51.580
am chaste. I

58:51.580 --> 58:53.580
have class. I

58:53.580 --> 58:55.580
am a feminist. I would also

58:55.580 --> 58:57.580
suggest accusing her of pandering to the

58:57.580 --> 58:59.580
male gaze. That's, of course, the

58:59.580 --> 59:01.580
feminist way of calling someone a

59:01.580 --> 59:03.580
lowdown hobag skank.

59:03.580 --> 59:05.580
So again we have envy to contempt

59:05.580 --> 59:07.580
sublimation. And often the contempt

59:07.580 --> 59:09.580
is moral. Virtuous.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.580
The psychological

59:11.580 --> 59:13.580
need to convince ourselves

59:13.580 --> 59:15.580
that envy is morality

59:15.580 --> 59:17.580
can become so strong

59:17.580 --> 59:19.580
that we actually start inventing things

59:19.580 --> 59:21.580
to be outraged about. Take

59:21.580 --> 59:23.580
for instance the tendency to imagine

59:23.580 --> 59:25.580
that the wealthy and powerful are

59:25.580 --> 59:27.580
enjoying wild satanic

59:27.580 --> 59:29.580
orgies and indulging all the

59:29.580 --> 59:31.580
forbidden salacious pleasures

59:31.580 --> 59:33.580
that we ourselves are denied.

59:33.580 --> 59:35.580
Like QAnon, these conspiracy

59:35.580 --> 59:37.580
theorists who want us to imagine

59:37.580 --> 59:39.580
Hillary Clinton reclining

59:39.580 --> 59:41.580
in a garden of earthly delights

59:41.580 --> 59:43.580
sampling the pleasures of

59:43.580 --> 59:45.580
ephibes.

59:45.580 --> 59:47.580
Live, laugh, love

59:47.580 --> 59:49.580
that for her. Envy is very

59:49.580 --> 59:51.580
imaginative when it comes to the

59:51.580 --> 59:53.580
hedonistic extravagance of the envied.

59:53.580 --> 59:55.580
Let's talk about Marie Antoinette,

59:55.580 --> 59:57.580
the queen of France who was guillotined

59:57.580 --> 59:59.580
by the revolution. If you know

59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.580
one thing about Marie Antoinette,

01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.580
it's probably that when she heard about a family

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:05.580
famine where the people had no bread,

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:07.580
she infamously responded,

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.580
let them eat cake.

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:11.580
What an evil bitch.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:13.580
How could she say that? Well,

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:15.580
she didn't.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.580
She never said it.

01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:19.580
It's a lie. The phrase

01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:21.580
let them eat cake, originally

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:23.580
let them eat brioche, first appeared

01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.580
in Rousseau's Confessions, written in

01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:27.580
1765 when Marie

01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:29.580
Antoinette was nine years old.

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:31.580
Rousseau attributed the line to

01:00:31.580 --> 01:00:33.580
a great princess.

01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:35.580
It's probably no one ever said this.

01:00:35.580 --> 01:00:37.580
It's kind of like how the most famous photo

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.580
of Paris Hilton is the one where

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.580
she's wearing a stop being poor

01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.580
t-shirt. What an evil

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.580
bitch. How could she wear that?

01:00:45.580 --> 01:00:47.580
Well, she didn't.

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:49.580
It's photoshopped.

01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:51.580
The actual shirt said stop being

01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:53.580
desperate. Envy likes to

01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.580
fabricate the diabolical

01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.580
crimes of its enemies. I assume

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.580
to compliment the hedonistic extravagance.

01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:01.580
I mean, what is a Disney villain

01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580
if not an opulent homosexual

01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:05.580
seen through the eyes of the envious?

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.580
I'm gonna try lowering

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.580
the ISO because it's so f***ing bright in here

01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:11.580
now. Okay, well it's a

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:13.580
much lower ISO. What if I get another

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:15.580
white over here? That's what this channel's really about.

01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:17.580
One biological female's quest

01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:19.580
to create a harmonious color story.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.580
In the years leading up to and

01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:23.580
during the French Revolution,

01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.580
Marie Antoinette was constantly defamed

01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:27.580
in these sleazy tabloids

01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:29.580
called libelle.

01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:31.580
It's the same root as the English word libel.

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.580
The often pornographic libelle

01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:35.580
depicted the queen as a bisexual

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.580
demon who was constantly having

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.580
drunken orgies and sexually manipulating

01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:41.580
everyone around her. All of which

01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:43.580
is very interesting, but

01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:45.580
none of which is true.

01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:47.580
The historian Robert Darnton called it

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.580
an avalanche of defamation

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:51.580
that has no parallel in the

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.580
history of vilification. This

01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:55.580
woman took the blame,

01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.580
the moral blame, for the

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.580
structural failings of a broken

01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.580
economic system. And by the time

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:03.580
she was brought before the revolutionary tribe

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.580
in 1793,

01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.580
the actual person Marie Antoinette

01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:09.580
had long ago been overshadowed

01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:11.580
by the libellous caricature of her.

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:13.580
Now there was maybe one

01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:15.580
good reason for executing the former

01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:17.580
queen, which is that the legitimacy

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:19.580
of your new republic is a

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.580
little more secure when you don't have

01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:23.580
living monarchs hanging around.

01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:25.580
Someone better tell the English.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:27.580
But the problem with that reasoning

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:29.580
is it has nothing to do with whether

01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:31.580
or not the queen deserved

01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.580
to die. And beheading a recently

01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:35.580
widowed mother of two in front of

01:02:35.580 --> 01:02:37.580
a jeering crowd for political expediency

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.580
might weigh a little

01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.580
heavy on the conscience.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.580
So the revolution had to convince themselves

01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:45.580
that the queen deserved it.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:47.580
Which was pretty easy after decades

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.580
of, again, false and

01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:51.580
defamatory gossip. In her biography

01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.580
of Marie Antoinette, Antonia

01:02:53.580 --> 01:02:55.580
Frazier describes how

01:02:55.580 --> 01:02:57.580
the prison guards separated Marie

01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.580
from her eight-year-old son, who they

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.580
plied with alcohol and groomed

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.580
into accusing his own mother

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.580
of incestuous abuse.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.580
To justify killing Marie

01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.580
Antoinette, they had to destroy

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.580
the idea of this woman

01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:13.580
as a mother. So she was convicted

01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:15.580
of what may as well have been

01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:17.580
crimes against ethics in games journalism

01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:19.580
and sent to the guillotine

01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:21.580
where her last words were

01:03:21.580 --> 01:03:23.580
sorry to the executioner for

01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.580
stepping on his foot.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.580
Uh, women stop

01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:29.580
apologizing challenge. This is what a

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.580
girl boss winning looks like.

01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:33.580
So Marie Antoinette literally

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.580
did nothing wrong.

01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.580
Hey, how are you?

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:39.580
An innocent milf was killed

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.580
that day and I, for one,

01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.580
won't stand for it.

01:03:43.580 --> 01:03:45.580
So look, we have a

01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:47.580
psychological incentive

01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:49.580
to believe that people whom

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:51.580
we envy are immoral monsters.

01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.580
Because then, we get to label our

01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:55.580
hatred and violence toward them justice.

01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.580
Cruelty generally

01:03:57.580 --> 01:03:59.580
cannot conceptualize itself

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.580
as cruelty. And part of the

01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.580
reason for that is that calling

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:05.580
cruelty what it is

01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.580
takes the fun out of it.

01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.580
It reminds me of the second best day

01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.580
in the history of Twitter.

01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:13.580
October 1st, 2020.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.580
The day that Trump got COVID.

01:04:15.580 --> 01:04:17.580
And I'm gonna be honest, I have never

01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:19.580
felt more schadenfreude

01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.580
in my entire life.

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:23.580
Well, well, well.

01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.580
If it isn't the leopards eating people's faces

01:04:25.580 --> 01:04:27.580
party having their faces eaten by

01:04:27.580 --> 01:04:29.580
leopards.

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:35.580
Last time I ate cake.

01:04:35.580 --> 01:04:37.580
Like Dan Savage said,

01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:39.580
it felt like Ronald Reagan got AIDS.

01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:41.580
The next day, I tweeted,

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:43.580
These last 24 hours have been the first time

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:45.580
I've genuinely enjoyed Twitter in years.

01:04:45.580 --> 01:04:47.580
Because this website is good for one thing only,

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.580
reveling in the cruelest of human impulses.

01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:51.580
And someone responded to that

01:04:51.580 --> 01:04:53.580
saying,

01:04:53.580 --> 01:04:55.580
Oh my god, could you even be

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:57.580
a bigger killjoy?

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.580
But why was I being a killjoy?

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.580
The tweet was about how much I was enjoying it.

01:05:01.580 --> 01:05:03.580
Well, for most people, I guess not

01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:05.580
me, but for normal people,

01:05:05.580 --> 01:05:07.580
for other girls, cruelty is only

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:09.580
pleasurable as long as they can convince

01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:11.580
themselves it's something other than

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:13.580
cruelty. Justice served.

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.580
So again, reason,

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.580
rationality, are often the attempt

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.580
to publicly communicate,

01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:21.580
to evangelize our

01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.580
private feelings. And morality,

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:25.580
ethics, and justice

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:27.580
are often put forward

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:29.580
as the respectable public

01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.580
face of private

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.580
envy, vindictiveness,

01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:35.580
and hatred. But is this a

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.580
corruption of morality?

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.580
Or have we stumbled onto something

01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.580
darker? What if morality

01:05:41.580 --> 01:05:43.580
itself is simply the

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.580
expression of some kind of

01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.580
sadomasochistic urge?

01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.580
It's too early for this.

01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:51.580
I mean, it's literally 7am

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:53.580
where I'm filming. I don't know how this keeps

01:05:53.580 --> 01:05:55.580
happening to me. My head gets cut off one afternoon,

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.580
puts me in a philosophical mood.

01:05:57.580 --> 01:05:59.580
The next morning,

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:01.580
I've stayed up all night and I'm still talking about

01:06:01.580 --> 01:06:03.580
the philosophes.

01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.580
Meow meow.

01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.580
Hello again, kittens.

01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.580
Let's talk about justice, uwu.

01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:11.580
I look like a Supreme Court justice.

01:06:11.580 --> 01:06:13.580
So nya? So to meow your?

01:06:13.580 --> 01:06:15.580
It would actually be fierce if I wasn't,

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.580
you know, if I wasn't being nyadily.

01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.580
Look, I've been seeing a lot

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.580
of comments lately along the lines of

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.580
Natalie used to do serious

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.580
academic arguments. Now she

01:06:25.580 --> 01:06:27.580
only cares about makeup.

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:29.580
Alright, you little shits. You want

01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:31.580
book learning? I'm gonna learn you so

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:33.580
hard. I'm gonna learn you so hard you're gonna

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:35.580
have a god damn

01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:37.580
headache in the morning. Friedrich

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:39.580
Nietzsche. Friedrich

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.580
Wilhelm Nietzsche. Do you mind if I call you Fred?

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:45.580
Friedrich was a German philosopher

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:47.580
who had a lot to say about

01:06:47.580 --> 01:06:49.580
envy and morality. But before

01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.580
we get into that, I want to say a little bit about his

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:53.580
life, because it's just very

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:55.580
funny. Nietzsche's famous for his concept

01:06:55.580 --> 01:06:57.580
of the Ubermensch, but Friedrich

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:59.580
sweet,

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.580
beautiful little Friedrich,

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.580
he was not what most people think of as an Ubermensch.

01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.580
Friedrich was a chronically

01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.580
ill, chronically in pain,

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:09.580
nearly blind incel

01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:11.580
who probably slept with a prostitute

01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:13.580
once and got syphilis and

01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:15.580
died. Life is

01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.580
funny. Sad, but funny.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.580
In the introduction to Beyond

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.580
Good and Evil, the editor says

01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:23.580
though he prided himself on being

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.580
comfortable with women, he does not seem to have been

01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.580
very successful in establishing emotionally

01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.580
satisfying relationships with them,

01:07:29.580 --> 01:07:31.580
which is hardly surprising.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:33.580
I love when the introduction to a book is just a

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:35.580
brutal roast of the author.

01:07:35.580 --> 01:07:37.580
Who wrote this? Rolf Peter Horstmann.

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.580
You're killing it, Rolf. You're a savage.

01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:41.580
I adore. Friedrich's books

01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:43.580
sold a dismal number of copies

01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:45.580
in his lifetime. What emerges

01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:47.580
is a picture of a totally isolated,

01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:49.580
highly neurotic man who had

01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.580
to try hard to avoid thinking of

01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:53.580
himself as a complete failure.

01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.580
Aww. He was also doing huge doses of

01:07:57.580 --> 01:07:59.580
opium, relatable, and writing himself

01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:01.580
prescriptions for sleeping pills using

01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:03.580
the name Dr. Nietzsche.

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.580
Dr. Nietzsche? Pretty sure I got a Xanax

01:08:05.580 --> 01:08:07.580
prescription from that guy once.

01:08:07.580 --> 01:08:09.580
Behind a Dairy Queen.

01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:11.580
Nietzsche was also a failed musician and

01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:13.580
was in love with the composer Richard Wagner's

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:15.580
wife.

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.580
The Virgin Nietzsche contra the

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.580
Chad Wagner. You beta cuck.

01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:21.580
Why did I do that?

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:23.580
Can we all agree that Catgirl Nietzsche

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.580
is by far the most cursed thing I've ever done?

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:27.580
I just want to mom this guy, honestly.

01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:29.580
I don't even care that he's a misogynist.

01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.580
His misogyny is simply

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.580
too sad to be offended by. You know, I think

01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:35.580
it's interesting that a person this

01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:37.580
pathetic can also be a genius

01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:39.580
whose name will never die. He's someone

01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:41.580
who had a lot of reason to be envious

01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:43.580
and self-pitying, but his philosophy

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.580
couldn't be more against that.

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.580
And as a person of pathetic experience

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.580
myself, that is unironically kind

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:51.580
of inspiring to me. So let's

01:08:51.580 --> 01:08:53.580
go in. In his book on the

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:55.580
genealogy of morality, Frederick

01:08:55.580 --> 01:08:57.580
wants to explain the origin

01:08:57.580 --> 01:08:59.580
of the concepts of good and evil.

01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:01.580
Under what conditions did man invent

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.580
the value judgments good and evil, and

01:09:03.580 --> 01:09:05.580
what value do they themselves have?

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.580
Have they to now obstructed or

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:09.580
promoted human flourishing? Hang on, my food's

01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:11.580
here. That's right, you're getting a mukbang,

01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:13.580
sweetie. Did you think I was gonna sit at this

01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.580
giant table and not be eating something?

01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:17.580
This video's been going on more than an hour, so I assume

01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:19.580
you guys are drunk by now, and we're just kind of

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:21.580
hanging out at this point. You guys can't even

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.580
see. Well, here. I've got

01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:25.580
a bunch of sushi, and it's my mission to eat

01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:27.580
all of this while summarizing the entire life

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:29.580
and work of Friedrich Nietzsche.

01:09:29.580 --> 01:09:31.580
Trisha Paytas, Nikocado, consider

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:33.580
this a challenge. So Frederick argues

01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:35.580
that good and bad, not

01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:37.580
good and evil, that's different, we'll get to that,

01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:39.580
but good and bad were originally

01:09:39.580 --> 01:09:41.580
the self-affirming values

01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.580
of people with power.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:45.580
So to be good meant to be powerful,

01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:47.580
strong, beautiful, healthy.

01:09:47.580 --> 01:09:49.580
And to be bad meant to be

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.580
weak, sick,

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:53.580
common, ugly.

01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.580
I'm gonna eat one like a cat.

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.580
And Frederick supports this speculation

01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.580
with etymology. So in a lot

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.580
of languages, the word that means morally

01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:03.580
good or spiritually noble

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:05.580
originally meant noble in the sense

01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:07.580
of aristocratic, the propertied

01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:09.580
class. Like in Buddhism,

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.580
the Arya Satyani, that's

01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:13.580
Sanskrit for noble truths.

01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:15.580
Arya means noble.

01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.580
And Arya is used to mean spiritually

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:19.580
noble, but earlier it meant

01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:21.580
the aristocracy, the rich.

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.580
And originally, it was just the name that a culture

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.580
in northern India gave themselves,

01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:27.580
the Aryans. I'm really

01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:29.580
working not to get soy sauce on this list.

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:31.580
This was later misunderstood by Europeans

01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:33.580
who wrongly thought

01:10:33.580 --> 01:10:35.580
that Aryan was a race.

01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:37.580
Oops.

01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:39.580
Goddammit.

01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:41.580
Goddammit, kids. Can we not?

01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:43.580
Frederick traces the origin of the

01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.580
German word gut, or the English

01:10:45.580 --> 01:10:47.580
good, to the name of the Goths.

01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:49.580
No, not those Goths.

01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:51.580
The Scandinavian people who invaded Europe.

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.580
Frederick calls them the blonde

01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:55.580
beasts of prey. I like to

01:10:55.580 --> 01:10:57.580
stalk my prey in the small hours

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.580
of the night.

01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:01.580
The German word schlecht, which means

01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.580
bad, is related to schlicht, which

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:05.580
means plain, simple, originally

01:11:05.580 --> 01:11:07.580
common, low, not

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:09.580
aristocratic, not noble.

01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:11.580
So good and bad

01:11:11.580 --> 01:11:13.580
were originally the values of warrior

01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:15.580
aristocrats who were like Homeric

01:11:15.580 --> 01:11:17.580
heroes celebrating themselves.

01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:19.580
And Frederick calls their value

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.580
system master morality.

01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:23.580
This glorification of combat,

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.580
feasting, athleticism,

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.580
sexual conquest,

01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:29.580
beauty. These things

01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:31.580
were called good. And their

01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:33.580
opposites, weakness, impotence,

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:35.580
ugliness, were called bad.

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.580
The ancient nobles worshipped

01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:39.580
noble gods who acted like them

01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:41.580
and shared their values. I mean, if I created

01:11:41.580 --> 01:11:43.580
a personal goddess, I think we all know

01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:45.580
what animal that would be. Me and the ancient

01:11:45.580 --> 01:11:47.580
Egyptians on the same page. So for

01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:49.580
example, Roman warriors could

01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:51.580
worship Mars, the god of war.

01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:53.580
And it was like they were worshipping themselves.

01:11:53.580 --> 01:11:55.580
They were dumb jocks, worshipping

01:11:55.580 --> 01:11:57.580
dumb jock gods. Well, good for them.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.580
But what about the people who got shoved

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.580
into lockers? Well,

01:12:01.580 --> 01:12:03.580
Frederick's example, and this is gonna

01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:05.580
create some misunderstandings later,

01:12:05.580 --> 01:12:07.580
but his example is

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.580
the Jews who were colonized

01:12:09.580 --> 01:12:11.580
by the Romans in Judea.

01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:13.580
And it's certainly not that the Jews didn't try

01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:15.580
to revolt. Oh, they did.

01:12:15.580 --> 01:12:17.580
Multiple times.

01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.580
But for several centuries, the Romans were

01:12:19.580 --> 01:12:21.580
just too powerful. No one could stop

01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:23.580
them. So the question is, what

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:25.580
happens psychologically to people

01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:27.580
who are oppressed and who lack the

01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.580
power to overthrow the oppressor?

01:12:29.580 --> 01:12:31.580
Well, in that case,

01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:33.580
frustrated vindictiveness builds over

01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:35.580
time to become this deep

01:12:35.580 --> 01:12:37.580
bitterness which Nietzsche gave the French

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:39.580
name, Résentiment.

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:41.580
Resentment in English.

01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:47.580
I don't speak French. I just enjoy

01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:49.580
making vaguely French noises.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:55.580
I don't like the English, but I like the French even less.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.580
Because they're always dressed so well, and they speak a sexier language

01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.580
than me. Stop it! This is your final

01:12:59.580 --> 01:13:01.580
warning, comprendez-vous? Good wine, though.

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:03.580
I'll give them that. So there's a German word,

01:13:03.580 --> 01:13:05.580
Neid, which means envy.

01:13:05.580 --> 01:13:07.580
So why is Frederick using this

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:09.580
French term, Résentiment?

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.580
What's going on, Frederick? Why are you speaking

01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:13.580
French? Are you nervous?

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:15.580
You trying to impress me? Nietzsche must

01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:17.580
have said Résentiment because he thought

01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:19.580
it was something different than envy.

01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.580
I think the difference is resentment,

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:23.580
and I'm just gonna use the English word so I don't sound like an

01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:25.580
asshole. Resentment is born

01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:27.580
not just of wanting what someone

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.580
has, but of a permanent frustration

01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.580
of the desire for resentment.

01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:33.580
Revenge. It's born of weakness,

01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.580
inability to get revenge.

01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.580
Now revenge itself

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.580
implies weakness, at least a

01:13:39.580 --> 01:13:41.580
temporary weakness. We say revenge

01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:43.580
is best served cold,

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.580
but actually, revenge is only

01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.580
served cold.

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.580
If it's served hot, if someone slaps

01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:51.580
you and you slap them back immediately,

01:13:51.580 --> 01:13:53.580
that's retaliation, not revenge.

01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.580
You brought

01:13:55.580 --> 01:13:57.580
this on yourself. Revenge is only

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.580
a possibility when you can't

01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:01.580
retaliate immediately. So you become

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.580
vindictive. You start plotting and

01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:05.580
scheming. But if you're too weak,

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:07.580
too impotent to have any

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.580
hope of revenge, then you become

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:11.580
resentful. So Nietzsche's argument is

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.580
that a person who's too weak to get material

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.580
revenge can instead

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:17.580
get psychological revenge

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:19.580
by creating a new morality.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.580
In Frederick's words,

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:23.580
the beginning of the slave's revolt

01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.580
in morality occurs when

01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:27.580
Résentiment itself turns creative

01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:29.580
and gives birth to values.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.580
This is a little high concept for a mukbang,

01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:33.580
isn't it? What are you doing, Frederick?

01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:35.580
So while master morality says that good

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:37.580
is power, riches, health, and

01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.580
strength, and bad is the

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:41.580
opposite, slave morality,

01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:43.580
the morality of resentment, says

01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:45.580
blessed are the poor, the

01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:47.580
meek, the sick, the powerless.

01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:49.580
This is the good

01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.580
of slave morality, and its opposite

01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:53.580
is not the bad, but a new concept,

01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:55.580
the evil. And what

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.580
is evil? Well, everything

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.580
that master morality says is good.

01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:01.580
Power. Wealth.

01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.580
Conquest. Sexual

01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.580
satisfaction.

01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.580
He's talking about

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:13.580
Christianity here, he's not talking about

01:15:13.580 --> 01:15:15.580
Judaism. But Frederick thinks of

01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.580
Christianity as the spiritual revenge

01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:19.580
of the Jews against the Romans,

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.580
an inversion of the empire's

01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:23.580
values. But he also thinks

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:25.580
that slave morality is fundamentally

01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.580
dishonest. It's like the fox

01:15:27.580 --> 01:15:29.580
and the grapes. Not being

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.580
able to take revenge is called

01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:33.580
not wanting to take revenge.

01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:35.580
It might even be called

01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:37.580
forgiveness. Slave morality

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.580
says that weakness is

01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:41.580
righteous. Submission to people you

01:15:41.580 --> 01:15:43.580
hate is called obedience.

01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:45.580
Having to wait is

01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.580
called patience.

01:15:47.580 --> 01:15:49.580
Inability to satisfy sexual desire

01:15:49.580 --> 01:15:51.580
is called chastity,

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:53.580
purity, and so on. And while

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.580
master morality is born of saying

01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.580
yes to yourself, as a powerful,

01:15:57.580 --> 01:15:59.580
noble beast

01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:01.580
of prey, slave morality

01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:03.580
is born of saying no

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.580
to the master and everything he has

01:16:05.580 --> 01:16:07.580
that you can't. I like to have

01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:09.580
my belly rubbed. Scratch my

01:16:09.580 --> 01:16:11.580
back above my tail, please.

01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.580
I'm gonna put the rest of the fish away because it's getting warm

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:15.580
and I'm full. This has not been a successful

01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:17.580
mukbang. It turns out that it's actually very difficult

01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.580
to do a mukbang while

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:21.580
talking. I should have thought this through a little harder.

01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.580
So slave morality is born of a repressed

01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:25.580
desire for revenge, but that desire

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:27.580
for revenge never completely disappears.

01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.580
It's there, for example, in the Christian

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.580
idea of the Last Judgment.

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.580
No need to take revenge

01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:35.580
against the wicked, my sheep. God

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:37.580
will do that for us. And in the meantime,

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.580
being weak

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:41.580
is good, actually.

01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:43.580
I find this book thrilling

01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:45.580
to read, honestly. And I'm not

01:16:45.580 --> 01:16:47.580
easily thrilled. Especially not

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:49.580
by philosophers. I think this book in particular

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.580
gets me because, especially

01:16:51.580 --> 01:16:53.580
if you were raised Christian, this is

01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:55.580
so the opposite of everything

01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:57.580
you were ever taught to believe that it almost feels

01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:59.580
like, dirty.

01:16:59.580 --> 01:17:01.580
Should I be reading this? Is this allowed?

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.580
Because even if you're not religious,

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.580
most of us still agree with a lot of

01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:07.580
Christian morality. Like, yeah, Jesus

01:17:07.580 --> 01:17:09.580
was a good guy. Blessed

01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:11.580
are the meek. Sure. But then

01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:13.580
Frederick comes along and he's like,

01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:15.580
hmm, morality is just a cope

01:17:15.580 --> 01:17:17.580
for frustrated vindictiveness.

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.580
And you're like, I need to lie down.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:21.580
Where's my smelling salts?

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:33.580
But wait, there's more.

01:17:33.580 --> 01:17:35.580
This gets even darker. Nietzsche

01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:37.580
thinks that over the last two millennia of European

01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.580
history, slave morality has

01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:41.580
triumphed. Saint Paul made

01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:43.580
Christianity marketable, the

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:45.580
Emperor Constantine converted,

01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.580
and by the Middle Ages, even

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.580
kings and aristocrats were kneeling down

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:51.580
not to powerful warrior gods

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:53.580
made in their own image, but to

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:55.580
a god that was weak.

01:17:55.580 --> 01:17:57.580
Suffering. Victimized.

01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.580
Oppressed.

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:01.580
Mmm. So by the 19th

01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:03.580
century, slave morality had become

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.580
the only morality.

01:18:05.580 --> 01:18:07.580
And it's not just Christianity, either.

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:09.580
The secular version of these values

01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.580
became socialism, anarchism.

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:13.580
About freethinkers and

01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.580
atheists, Nietzsche has this

01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:17.580
to say.

01:18:21.580 --> 01:18:23.580
Okay, the poison.

01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.580
What is the poison?

01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.580
Well, Frederick thinks that resentment

01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.580
poisons the mind,

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.580
and turns humans against our own

01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:33.580
natural instincts. Not just against

01:18:33.580 --> 01:18:35.580
aggression, but against sexuality,

01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:37.580
against ambition,

01:18:37.580 --> 01:18:39.580
against power, against life

01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:41.580
itself. And there's two possible

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.580
outcomes of this. One is

01:18:43.580 --> 01:18:45.580
that resentment becomes a political

01:18:45.580 --> 01:18:47.580
movement. The conspiracy of those

01:18:47.580 --> 01:18:49.580
who suffer. The tyranny of

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:51.580
the herd. The revolution

01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:53.580
that eats itself. Only we

01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.580
are good and just, is what they say.

01:18:55.580 --> 01:18:57.580
As though health, success, strength,

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.580
pride, and the feeling of power

01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:01.580
were in themselves depravities

01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:03.580
for which penance, bitter penance

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.580
will one day be exacted. Among them

01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.580
we find plenty of vengeance seekers

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.580
disguised as judges

01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:11.580
with the word justice continually in their mouth

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.580
like poisonous spittle.

01:19:13.580 --> 01:19:15.580
So you get the mentality of a hyper-moralistic

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.580
resentment mob. Which I'm sure

01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:19.580
we're all familiar with. The other outcome

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:21.580
is that this moralism turns

01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:23.580
inward and attacks the individual

01:19:23.580 --> 01:19:25.580
conscience, producing

01:19:25.580 --> 01:19:27.580
asceticism, self-denial,

01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:29.580
guilt. Because slave morality

01:19:29.580 --> 01:19:31.580
condemns not only the external

01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:33.580
beasts of prey who are oppressing us

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:35.580
but also the beast

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:37.580
of prey within. Our own

01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:39.580
animal instincts. What Christianity

01:19:39.580 --> 01:19:41.580
calls sin.

01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:43.580
So Frederick thinks that modern humans

01:19:43.580 --> 01:19:45.580
have become sick.

01:19:45.580 --> 01:19:47.580
We hate ourselves. We hate our

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:49.580
own nature. We hate

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.580
life itself. I mean

01:19:51.580 --> 01:19:53.580
is he wrong? You see a girl

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:55.580
boss winning. I only

01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:57.580
see the will to power.

01:19:57.580 --> 01:19:59.580
Frederick thinks of modern men as

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:01.580
once proud wildcats who

01:20:01.580 --> 01:20:03.580
become domesticated house pets

01:20:03.580 --> 01:20:05.580
at the cost of everything

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:07.580
great in the human spirit.

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:09.580
That's very valid

01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:11.580
Frederick.

01:20:11.580 --> 01:20:13.580
That's super hecking

01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:15.580
valid. So look I've been

01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:17.580
pretty positive about Nietzsche so far

01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.580
but I do have a couple critiques I want to say.

01:20:19.580 --> 01:20:21.580
One is that Frederick

01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:23.580
associating slave morality with

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:25.580
the Jews is very irresponsible.

01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:27.580
Even though he didn't intend to be

01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:29.580
anti-semitic and even though he was outspoken

01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:31.580
against anti-semitism in his own time

01:20:31.580 --> 01:20:33.580
when you keep referring to the Christian

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.580
values you're critiquing as

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:37.580
Jewish hatred and Jewish revenge

01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:39.580
some people might get

01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:41.580
the wrong idea. And some people did

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:43.580
Frederick. Like your dumbass sister

01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:45.580
Elizabeth Nietzsche who became a literal

01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.580
alternative

01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:49.580
ethno-identitarian. God damn it

01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:51.580
Liz. Kind of goth goals though.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.580
Yes that kind of goth. You're

01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:55.580
right this time. My other critique is that

01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:57.580
it doesn't seem to have occurred to Frederick

01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.580
that genuinely caring about other people

01:20:59.580 --> 01:21:01.580
is an option. Like not because

01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:03.580
caring about other people is repressing your

01:21:03.580 --> 01:21:05.580
true selfish nature, but just because

01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.580
caring about other people is

01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:09.580
part of your nature. And isn't it?

01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.580
Isn't caring about other people

01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:13.580
also in our nature? I do think

01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:15.580
most of what Nietzsche says about resentment

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.580
accurately describes a

01:21:17.580 --> 01:21:19.580
very real thing. But it's not

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.580
the only thing. There is genuine

01:21:21.580 --> 01:21:23.580
care and love in this world

01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:25.580
I've been told. I've heard rumors.

01:21:25.580 --> 01:21:27.580
And I'm even gonna go so far as to say

01:21:27.580 --> 01:21:29.580
hashtag not all Christians. Christ

01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:31.580
I'm defending the Christians. What does this channel

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:33.580
come to? There are Christians

01:21:33.580 --> 01:21:35.580
maybe not most, but still some

01:21:35.580 --> 01:21:37.580
for whom love and forgiveness

01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:39.580
are genuine experiences

01:21:39.580 --> 01:21:41.580
and not just some kind of

01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:43.580
twisted impotent

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.580
passive aggressive vengeance.

01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:47.580
Where I agree with Nietzsche and with Freud

01:21:47.580 --> 01:21:49.580
is I do think a lot of the

01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:51.580
emotional foundation of justice

01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:53.580
and morality is

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.580
retribution, envy

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:57.580
or some combination of the two.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.580
But maybe it doesn't have to be that way.

01:21:59.580 --> 01:22:01.580
There's a famous Martin Luther King

01:22:01.580 --> 01:22:03.580
quote responding to Nietzsche

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:05.580
What is needed is a realization

01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:07.580
that power

01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:09.580
without love is reckless

01:22:09.580 --> 01:22:11.580
and abusive and that love without power

01:22:11.580 --> 01:22:13.580
is sentimental and anemic.

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:15.580
Power at its best

01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:17.580
is love

01:22:17.580 --> 01:22:19.580
implementing the demands of justice

01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:21.580
and justice at its

01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:23.580
best is love correcting

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.580
everything that stands

01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:27.580
against love.

01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:29.580
So Reverend King concedes to Nietzsche

01:22:29.580 --> 01:22:31.580
that to simply call power

01:22:31.580 --> 01:22:33.580
evil is a sickness

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:35.580
anemic. But there still needs

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.580
to be some kind of emotional or spiritual

01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.580
force that keeps humanity

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:41.580
from tearing itself apart. And maybe

01:22:41.580 --> 01:22:43.580
something like this Christian idea

01:22:43.580 --> 01:22:45.580
of love for humanity is the missing

01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:47.580
piece. Because without something like that

01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.580
I just see retribution

01:22:49.580 --> 01:22:51.580
and envy snowballing

01:22:51.580 --> 01:22:53.580
into human self destruction.

01:22:53.580 --> 01:22:55.580
And I hate that for us. It's not very

01:22:55.580 --> 01:22:57.580
sliving of us. Do you guys know about sliving?

01:22:57.580 --> 01:22:59.580
Do you even subscribe to Paris Hilton's

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:01.580
YouTube channel? She doesn't have as many subscribers

01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:03.580
as I do but you know. I try to support

01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:05.580
smaller creators.

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:07.580
Sliving is basically slaying and living

01:23:07.580 --> 01:23:09.580
your best life into one word. It's the new

01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.580
that's hot. Maybe I'll do a video about

01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:13.580
love when I'm in a better mood.

01:23:13.580 --> 01:23:15.580
So for now, well

01:23:15.580 --> 01:23:17.580
let's put it this way. God is

01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.580
dead and we have killed

01:23:19.580 --> 01:23:21.580
him, yeah?

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:23.580
It's living.

01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:33.580
So let us give him

01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:35.580
all we see.

01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:41.580
Okay. I'm moisturized. I'm primed.

01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:43.580
I've proven my academic credentials.

01:23:43.580 --> 01:23:45.580
Now it's time to do my makeup.

01:23:45.580 --> 01:23:47.580
That's right children, I'm going full

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.580
Bailey Sarian. I'm going full

01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:51.580
suspish. So I guess I should

01:23:51.580 --> 01:23:53.580
say something about the political implications

01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:55.580
of all this since, uh, I guess

01:23:55.580 --> 01:23:57.580
this channel's about politics. Sometimes

01:23:57.580 --> 01:23:59.580
I have to read my own Wikipedia article

01:23:59.580 --> 01:24:01.580
to remember what I'm doing with my life.

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:03.580
But this morality of resentment,

01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:05.580
of impotence, and permanently

01:24:05.580 --> 01:24:07.580
frustrated revenge, judges

01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.580
that power

01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:11.580
is evil. I don't use foundation, I just

01:24:11.580 --> 01:24:13.580
use concealer. I know that's like not

01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:15.580
how you're supposed to do makeup, but I don't need to be good

01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:17.580
at makeup, okay? I have a million subscribers on

01:24:17.580 --> 01:24:19.580
YouTube. I don't need to be good.

01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.580
There was a New York Times article about young

01:24:21.580 --> 01:24:23.580
women's attitudes toward political ambition

01:24:23.580 --> 01:24:25.580
and one of the women who was interviewed said

01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:27.580
as a white woman, I know

01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:29.580
I have unearned privilege. So

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:31.580
am I really the best person to be in leadership?

01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:33.580
Uh, yes.

01:24:33.580 --> 01:24:35.580
Yes you are. Because we need leaders

01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.580
like you who are capable of

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:39.580
questioning the legitimacy of their own

01:24:39.580 --> 01:24:41.580
authority. Otherwise, we're

01:24:41.580 --> 01:24:43.580
just going to be stuck with another blonde beast of

01:24:43.580 --> 01:24:45.580
prey. And of course it's good to be

01:24:45.580 --> 01:24:47.580
aware of your privilege, especially

01:24:47.580 --> 01:24:49.580
as a leader, but let's not be so

01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:51.580
self-effacing that we efface

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:53.580
ourselves off the face of the earth.

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:55.580
This is the self-sabotage of

01:24:55.580 --> 01:24:57.580
resentment values. If you think

01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.580
power is evil, then you've given

01:24:59.580 --> 01:25:01.580
up on the ambition to acquire any

01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:03.580
power, which virtually guarantees

01:25:03.580 --> 01:25:05.580
your political irrelevance, since

01:25:05.580 --> 01:25:07.580
like MLK said, you have to at least

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.580
have some power to implement

01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:11.580
the demands of justice. Remember

01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:13.580
what incels call taking the black

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.580
pill, this conviction that the reason

01:25:15.580 --> 01:25:17.580
you don't have a girlfriend is just that you're

01:25:17.580 --> 01:25:19.580
genetically undesirable. There's

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:21.580
nothing you can do to change it, and

01:25:21.580 --> 01:25:23.580
I guess women are just too shallow

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.580
to be attracted to all the amazing hatred

01:25:25.580 --> 01:25:27.580
and spite that festers in your heart.

01:25:27.580 --> 01:25:29.580
For a lot of black-pilled incels,

01:25:29.580 --> 01:25:31.580
it seems like there's only one thing left in

01:25:31.580 --> 01:25:33.580
life that they enjoy, which is

01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:35.580
simply the pleasure of complaining.

01:25:35.580 --> 01:25:37.580
Of moaning in pain.

01:25:37.580 --> 01:25:39.580
It reminds me of a comment from

01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:41.580
Dostoevsky's second most

01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.580
horrible protagonist.

01:25:43.580 --> 01:25:45.580
Even in toothache there is enjoyment.

01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:47.580
In that case, of course, people are not spiteful in silence

01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:49.580
but moan. But they are not candid

01:25:49.580 --> 01:25:51.580
moans, they are malignant moans.

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:53.580
And the malignancy is the whole point.

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:55.580
The moan is a protest

01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.580
against the meaninglessness of pain.

01:25:57.580 --> 01:25:59.580
And part of the satisfaction of

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:01.580
moaning is inflicting your

01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:03.580
pain on other people.

01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:05.580
This kind of malignant moaning,

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.580
it's kind of the opposite of music.

01:26:07.580 --> 01:26:09.580
Because a lot of music, like blues,

01:26:09.580 --> 01:26:11.580
is benevolent moaning

01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:13.580
that transforms pain into pleasure.

01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:15.580
I mean, that's what blues is all about.

01:26:15.580 --> 01:26:17.580
My woman don't love me no more, but I know her

01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:19.580
sister will. You know, optimism.

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:21.580
I think a lot of incel discourse

01:26:21.580 --> 01:26:23.580
is really just malignant moaning.

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:25.580
Right, it's not an attempt to diagnose

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:27.580
or solve any problem.

01:26:27.580 --> 01:26:29.580
It's just a contagious expression of misery.

01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:31.580
A moan of pain that

01:26:31.580 --> 01:26:33.580
masquerades as a political agenda.

01:26:33.580 --> 01:26:35.580
Sexual Marxism, they call it.

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.580
The redistribution of sex.

01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:39.580
State-mandated GFs.

01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:41.580
That's very valid.

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:43.580
Of course, they don't actually expect any of this

01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.580
to happen. That's not

01:26:45.580 --> 01:26:47.580
the point. So incels are kind of

01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:49.580
a universal punching bag online.

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:51.580
It's very easy to point and laugh

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.580
at them. But what's harder is to look

01:26:53.580 --> 01:26:55.580
in the mirror and notice how these

01:26:55.580 --> 01:26:57.580
exact same tendencies

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.580
are rampant in our own communities.

01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:01.580
So the incel black pill is just one

01:27:01.580 --> 01:27:03.580
instance of what I call an ideology

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:05.580
of resentment. A discourse

01:27:05.580 --> 01:27:07.580
that outwardly appears like moral

01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:09.580
or political critique, but which on examination

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.580
is mainly just a resentful

01:27:11.580 --> 01:27:13.580
moan. The goal of resentment

01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:15.580
politics is not to improve

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:17.580
conditions. In fact, the

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.580
resentful person is full of contempt

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:21.580
for any morally compromised

01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:23.580
sellouts who are

01:27:23.580 --> 01:27:25.580
attempting to enact plausible reforms.

01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:27.580
They don't want victory.

01:27:27.580 --> 01:27:29.580
They don't want power. They want to endlessly

01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:31.580
critique power.

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:33.580
Because for them, critique is

01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:35.580
an important psychological defense

01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:37.580
against feeling

01:27:37.580 --> 01:27:39.580
impotent. Shaler described

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.580
it this way.

01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.580
What am I going to do with my eyes?

01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.580
I think a pink kind of

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:55.580
look. We've been doing a lot of pink looks.

01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:57.580
I love that hay fever look.

01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.580
As a general rule, the more radical

01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:01.580
a political community claims to be,

01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:03.580
the more likely it is

01:28:03.580 --> 01:28:05.580
to be a community of resentment.

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.580
Self-styled radicals will tell you,

01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:09.580
superficial surface reforms do not

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:11.580
interest us. The problem must

01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:13.580
be critiqued at its root.

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:15.580
And then the root turns out to be this universal

01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:17.580
all-encompassing evil, right?

01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:19.580
Society itself.

01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.580
The system. The machine.

01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:23.580
A resentment ideologue always

01:28:23.580 --> 01:28:25.580
imagines himself to be engaged in a

01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.580
kind of satanic revolt

01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:29.580
against an omnipotent,

01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:31.580
omnipresent enemy. Okay,

01:28:31.580 --> 01:28:33.580
I need to do makeup for a second.

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:35.580
It's harder than it looks to be a makeup vlogger.

01:28:35.580 --> 01:28:37.580
It's hard to talk while doing this. And nothing short of

01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:39.580
total revolution counts as any sort of

01:28:39.580 --> 01:28:41.580
victory whatsoever. We have to dismantle

01:28:41.580 --> 01:28:43.580
the entire system.

01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:45.580
Burn it all down.

01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:47.580
I guess it's pedestrian to point out that this is

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:49.580
the revolutionary utopian equivalent

01:28:49.580 --> 01:28:51.580
of Christians awaiting the last judgment.

01:28:51.580 --> 01:28:53.580
Our kingdom is coming, comrades!

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:55.580
Often the appeal of utopian

01:28:55.580 --> 01:28:57.580
ideology is similar to religion.

01:28:57.580 --> 01:28:59.580
It's not about healthcare,

01:28:59.580 --> 01:29:01.580
higher wages,

01:29:01.580 --> 01:29:03.580
relief from police violence.

01:29:03.580 --> 01:29:05.580
Those are actual goals that could be

01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:07.580
demanded, worked for, and achieved.

01:29:07.580 --> 01:29:09.580
Utopian ideology instead

01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:11.580
promises relief from some

01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:13.580
general malaise.

01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:15.580
Alienation.

01:29:15.580 --> 01:29:17.580
And so ironically, it can have the same

01:29:17.580 --> 01:29:19.580
opiate effect that Marx ascribes

01:29:19.580 --> 01:29:21.580
to religion. But release from

01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:23.580
the general anguish of human existence

01:29:23.580 --> 01:29:25.580
is not a political goal.

01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:27.580
There's been many revolutions in the last

01:29:27.580 --> 01:29:29.580
few centuries, and so far

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:31.580
zero utopias.

01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.580
Resentment, envy,

01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.580
and hunger, for that matter,

01:29:35.580 --> 01:29:37.580
are not satiated by the downfall

01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:39.580
of the old regime. When the people

01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:41.580
have no bread, they eat the rich.

01:29:41.580 --> 01:29:43.580
And when the rich

01:29:43.580 --> 01:29:45.580
are gone, they eat

01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:47.580
each other. And because of the proximity

01:29:47.580 --> 01:29:49.580
effect, envy may actually

01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:51.580
increase after the revolution.

01:29:51.580 --> 01:29:53.580
You may actually be more envious of a

01:29:53.580 --> 01:29:55.580
favored comrade, a

01:29:55.580 --> 01:29:57.580
successful citoyen, oui,

01:29:57.580 --> 01:29:59.580
a kulak, than you ever were of the

01:29:59.580 --> 01:30:01.580
aristocrats. So envy turns

01:30:01.580 --> 01:30:03.580
paranoid and imaginative

01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.580
in revolutionary moments.

01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:07.580
It gets sublimated into morality,

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.580
and the accusations

01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:11.580
start flying. That citizen

01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.580
is conspiring against the revolution.

01:30:13.580 --> 01:30:15.580
That peasant is hoarding grain.

01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:17.580
So the guillotine starts slicing

01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:19.580
thousands of heads off, the gulags

01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:21.580
fill up, or an authoritarian

01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:23.580
strongman takes over just to

01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:25.580
announce another revolution

01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.580
two decades later. The things people will do

01:30:27.580 --> 01:30:29.580
to stay relevant, honestly.

01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:31.580
And for what? What long-term

01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:33.580
egalitarian utopia results?

01:30:33.580 --> 01:30:35.580
Socialism with Chinese characteristics?

01:30:37.580 --> 01:30:39.580
So look, I do understand

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:41.580
that sometimes you just have to

01:30:41.580 --> 01:30:43.580
do a revolution. And if I'd been there in

01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.580
1789, I'm sure

01:30:45.580 --> 01:30:47.580
I'd be storming the Bastille myself.

01:30:47.580 --> 01:30:49.580
But I just wish we could stop being so doe-eyed about it.

01:30:49.580 --> 01:30:51.580
Revolution is a bloody nightmare that

01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.580
happens because society is collapsing

01:30:53.580 --> 01:30:55.580
and people are desperate. At worst,

01:30:55.580 --> 01:30:57.580
revolution is nothing more than a

01:30:57.580 --> 01:30:59.580
violent day of retribution. And at

01:30:59.580 --> 01:31:01.580
best, it lays the groundwork for future

01:31:01.580 --> 01:31:03.580
incremental progress. But it will never

01:31:03.580 --> 01:31:05.580
usher in utopia, nor is it the

01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:07.580
antidote to a vague sense of unease, which

01:31:07.580 --> 01:31:09.580
I'm sorry to report, is

01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.580
simply the resting state of an unsedated

01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.580
human mind. Now I'm not

01:31:13.580 --> 01:31:15.580
saying, as some conservatives do,

01:31:15.580 --> 01:31:17.580
that all leftist or all

01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.580
egalitarian politics is born of

01:31:19.580 --> 01:31:21.580
envy. No. This is a

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.580
specific subtype. There are

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.580
plenty of reasons, other than

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:27.580
envy or fear of envy, to oppose

01:31:27.580 --> 01:31:29.580
an economic distribution where

01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.580
some people have billions of dollars

01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:33.580
while other people are dying because they can't afford

01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.580
insulin. Objectively, that is

01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:37.580
not an efficient use of resources to

01:31:37.580 --> 01:31:39.580
promote human well-being. And personally,

01:31:39.580 --> 01:31:41.580
I just don't want to live in a country

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.580
where people are dying because they

01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:45.580
can't afford medicine. And I'm willing to pay

01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:47.580
however many taxes it takes

01:31:47.580 --> 01:31:49.580
for that not to happen. So while I'm

01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:51.580
putting down straw-man versions of my

01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:53.580
argument, I'm also not

01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:55.580
saying, oh, let's just stop being

01:31:55.580 --> 01:31:57.580
envious. No. That's

01:31:57.580 --> 01:31:59.580
impossible. I think envy is like libido.

01:31:59.580 --> 01:32:01.580
It's a basic force of human

01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:03.580
nature that's more or less

01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:05.580
unstoppable. But with the right leadership,

01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:07.580
I think that envy can

01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.580
potentially be sublimated

01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:11.580
or redirected into something

01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.580
more constructive. Because raw

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.580
envy is a very bad

01:32:15.580 --> 01:32:17.580
basis for egalitarian politics.

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.580
It often targets the wrong people,

01:32:19.580 --> 01:32:21.580
like millionaires instead of billionaires.

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:23.580
And eventually, it turns the revolution against

01:32:23.580 --> 01:32:25.580
itself. And you get the circular firing

01:32:25.580 --> 01:32:27.580
squad. The self-cannibalism.

01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.580
The problem I see on the left today

01:32:29.580 --> 01:32:31.580
is that without any genuine political

01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:33.580
outlet, resentment mostly manifests

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.580
as morality. Morality

01:32:35.580 --> 01:32:37.580
itself being a way to

01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.580
vent envious aggression and vindictiveness.

01:32:39.580 --> 01:32:41.580
On the left, we claim to be so

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:43.580
impersonal, right? We're all about structural

01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:45.580
analysis. The material

01:32:45.580 --> 01:32:47.580
conditions. Systems of

01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:49.580
power. Intersectional identity

01:32:49.580 --> 01:32:51.580
hierarchies. But if you look at what people

01:32:51.580 --> 01:32:53.580
actually spend their time doing here,

01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:55.580
it's all this obsessive moral

01:32:55.580 --> 01:32:57.580
policing. I wonder if because

01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:59.580
leftists can't seem to win on any

01:32:59.580 --> 01:33:01.580
major political stage, we feel

01:33:01.580 --> 01:33:03.580
disempowered. And so this moral

01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.580
fanaticism is a

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.580
psychological substitute. Like with Marie

01:33:07.580 --> 01:33:09.580
Antoinette, it's easier to blame

01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:11.580
people than systems. Also,

01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:13.580
structural analysis is

01:33:13.580 --> 01:33:15.580
very boring, and destroying people

01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:17.580
with gossip is extremely entertaining.

01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:19.580
This obsessive

01:33:19.580 --> 01:33:21.580
moral policing also gets

01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:23.580
turned inward and becomes leftist

01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:25.580
guilt. You know, this useless

01:33:25.580 --> 01:33:27.580
internalized scolding.

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.580
I think I'm done with my makeup. What do we

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.580
think? Leave a comment. I'm always hesitant

01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:33.580
to do anything about skincare, since last time

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.580
I did skincare, I was critiqued by Hyram.

01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.580
So I am gonna spray my face a couple

01:33:37.580 --> 01:33:39.580
times with this Tatcha skin

01:33:39.580 --> 01:33:41.580
mist, if that's okay with Hyram.

01:33:41.580 --> 01:33:43.580
It feels good to finally address this

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:45.580
feud. Clear the air.

01:33:45.580 --> 01:33:47.580
I look a lot better with makeup.

01:33:47.580 --> 01:33:49.580
I don't want to say that I don't have natural beauty,

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:51.580
it's just that it's very much enhanced by

01:33:51.580 --> 01:33:53.580
painting a different face on top of

01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:55.580
my face. But hey, at least this way

01:33:55.580 --> 01:33:57.580
I've kind of earned it, you know?

01:33:57.580 --> 01:33:59.580
Because it's my skill. So there's a podcast

01:33:59.580 --> 01:34:01.580
called Guilty Feminist that's been

01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:03.580
running for years. And I haven't listened in a

01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:05.580
while, but in the early episodes, they'd bring

01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:07.580
on these women who would confess their

01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:09.580
feminist sins. You know,

01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:11.580
hi, my name is Amber,

01:34:11.580 --> 01:34:13.580
I'm a feminist, but

01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:15.580
I enjoy being choked

01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:17.580
in bed. It's

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:19.580
hard being a woman. Not only are you being

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:21.580
choked, you also feel guilty

01:34:21.580 --> 01:34:23.580
about it. The same moral hand-wringing

01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:25.580
happens with body positivity.

01:34:25.580 --> 01:34:27.580
When you make loving your body into

01:34:27.580 --> 01:34:29.580
a moral imperative, not

01:34:29.580 --> 01:34:31.580
only are you still going to hate your body,

01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:33.580
but now you're also going to feel guilty

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.580
about hating your body because it makes you a

01:34:35.580 --> 01:34:37.580
bad feminist. So there was one problem,

01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:39.580
and now there's two problems.

01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:41.580
Thanks, morality. That's very

01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:43.580
helpful. Now I want to take a moment to

01:34:43.580 --> 01:34:45.580
acknowledge that a lot of conservatives

01:34:45.580 --> 01:34:47.580
have made some version of the

01:34:47.580 --> 01:34:49.580
argument I'm making in this video.

01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:51.580
For example, Jordan Peterson

01:34:51.580 --> 01:34:53.580
and Camille Paglia have argued

01:34:53.580 --> 01:34:55.580
that academic postmodernists

01:34:55.580 --> 01:34:57.580
are motivated by resentment. The argument

01:34:57.580 --> 01:34:59.580
is that deconstructionist

01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:01.580
literary theory is a kind of envious

01:35:01.580 --> 01:35:03.580
vengeance against the beauty

01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:05.580
and virtuosity of canonical

01:35:05.580 --> 01:35:07.580
great art. And yeah, there's probably

01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.580
some truth to that. A lot of academics

01:35:09.580 --> 01:35:11.580
are field artists, but I was even more

01:35:11.580 --> 01:35:13.580
manqué than that. I've noticed that

01:35:13.580 --> 01:35:15.580
working-class, non-academic socialists

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:17.580
do tend to be more

01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:19.580
productive and more self-advancing,

01:35:19.580 --> 01:35:21.580
involved in unionizing or organizing.

01:35:21.580 --> 01:35:23.580
Whereas, it's usually people who

01:35:23.580 --> 01:35:25.580
went to college. I went to

01:35:25.580 --> 01:35:27.580
college!

01:35:27.580 --> 01:35:29.580
Presumably because they had middle

01:35:29.580 --> 01:35:31.580
class ambitions at some point,

01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:33.580
but whose middle-class ambitions have

01:35:33.580 --> 01:35:35.580
failed. Who become the great

01:35:35.580 --> 01:35:37.580
critiquers of capital. I mean, I can tell you

01:35:37.580 --> 01:35:39.580
from experience that when I was eating

01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:41.580
Chef Boyardee over my master's degree,

01:35:41.580 --> 01:35:43.580
that's when I was most likely to say things like

01:35:43.580 --> 01:35:45.580
According to Antonio Gramsci,

01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:47.580
in the logic of late-stage capitalism,

01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.580
the culturally hegemonic neoliberal

01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.580
ideology manufactures the consent

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:53.580
of the civilian.

01:35:53.580 --> 01:35:55.580
Uh, so point taken. But some conservatives

01:35:55.580 --> 01:35:57.580
take this argument way too

01:35:57.580 --> 01:35:59.580
far and try to argue that the entire

01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:01.580
left is nothing but a coalition

01:36:01.580 --> 01:36:03.580
of resentment. Like there's a video on YouTube

01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:05.580
of the philosophy professor Steven

01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.580
Hicks doing a version of the

01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.580
post-modernism is resentment argument,

01:36:09.580 --> 01:36:11.580
and in the comments section there's a bunch of people

01:36:11.580 --> 01:36:13.580
saying, this describes Black

01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:15.580
Lives Matter, Antifa, and

01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.580
the Democrats. Does

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:19.580
it though? I mean, any political movement

01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:21.580
is gonna have people in it who suffer

01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:23.580
from resentment poisoning. But Black Lives

01:36:23.580 --> 01:36:25.580
Matter, at its core,

01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:27.580
is about the right not to be murdered

01:36:27.580 --> 01:36:29.580
by police. The slogan,

01:36:29.580 --> 01:36:31.580
Black Lives Matter, is an affirmation

01:36:31.580 --> 01:36:33.580
of the value of Black life.

01:36:33.580 --> 01:36:35.580
So, that seems like something even

01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:37.580
Nietzsche would approve of. Huey Newton,

01:36:37.580 --> 01:36:39.580
the co-founder of the Black Panther Party,

01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.580
was inspired by Nietzsche to

01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:43.580
create the slogan, All Power to the People.

01:36:43.580 --> 01:36:45.580
When we coined the expression

01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:47.580
All Power to the People, we had in mind

01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:49.580
emphasizing the word power, for

01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:51.580
we recognize that the will to power is

01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:53.580
the basic drive of man. But it is

01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:55.580
incorrect to seek power over people.

01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:57.580
We have been subjugated to the dehumanizing

01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.580
power of exploitation and

01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:01.580
racism for hundreds of years, and

01:37:01.580 --> 01:37:03.580
the Black community has its will to power

01:37:03.580 --> 01:37:05.580
also. What we seek, however,

01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:07.580
is not power over people, but the

01:37:07.580 --> 01:37:09.580
power of control of our own destiny.

01:37:09.580 --> 01:37:11.580
That, to me, is a

01:37:11.580 --> 01:37:13.580
role model for how to do identity politics

01:37:13.580 --> 01:37:15.580
without centering resentment.

01:37:15.580 --> 01:37:17.580
It's instead an affirmation of

01:37:17.580 --> 01:37:19.580
self-determination and self-respect.

01:37:19.580 --> 01:37:21.580
Like Nietzsche would say, it's saying

01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:23.580
yes to yourself. Whereas, if your

01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:25.580
whole political project is defined in the

01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:27.580
negative, then you're allowing yourself

01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.580
to be defined by your enemies. I find

01:37:29.580 --> 01:37:31.580
feminism is prone to this, where even

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.580
and in fact especially the most radical

01:37:33.580 --> 01:37:35.580
feminists cannot seem to escape

01:37:35.580 --> 01:37:37.580
this resentful consciousness of being

01:37:37.580 --> 01:37:39.580
the second sex and defining themselves

01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.580
against men.

01:37:41.580 --> 01:37:43.580
Earlier I mentioned Andrea Dworkin in a

01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:45.580
positive way. She's the most radical of

01:37:45.580 --> 01:37:47.580
radical feminists, and my first

01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:49.580
impulse is actually to defend her

01:37:49.580 --> 01:37:51.580
because she's very widely hated

01:37:51.580 --> 01:37:53.580
and most of the people who hate her

01:37:53.580 --> 01:37:55.580
hate a caricature. Like in that Steven

01:37:55.580 --> 01:37:57.580
Hicks video, Hicks summarizes

01:37:57.580 --> 01:37:58.580
Dworkin as,

01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:03.580
literally in the preface to her most

01:38:03.580 --> 01:38:05.580
famous book, Dworkin says,

01:38:05.580 --> 01:38:07.580
If one's sexual experience

01:38:07.580 --> 01:38:09.580
has always and without exception

01:38:09.580 --> 01:38:11.580
been based on dominance,

01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:13.580
how could one understand that this

01:38:13.580 --> 01:38:15.580
book does not say that all

01:38:15.580 --> 01:38:17.580
men are rapists or that all intercourse

01:38:17.580 --> 01:38:19.580
is rape? Listen Hicks,

01:38:19.580 --> 01:38:21.580
I get that you're a full professor and I'm

01:38:21.580 --> 01:38:23.580
just a makeup vlogger, but my gut

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:25.580
feeling on this one is, before

01:38:25.580 --> 01:38:27.580
criticizing a book, maybe

01:38:27.580 --> 01:38:29.580
read the book. Just a thought.

01:38:29.580 --> 01:38:31.580
Get it together prof. You're being owned

01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:33.580
online by a makeup vlogger. I mean

01:38:33.580 --> 01:38:35.580
there's no shame in that, it happens to me all the time.

01:38:35.580 --> 01:38:37.580
That being said, I do think that Hicks

01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:39.580
is coincidentally correct

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:41.580
that Dworkin is a theorist

01:38:41.580 --> 01:38:43.580
of resentment. What Dworkin does

01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:45.580
say in this book is arguably

01:38:45.580 --> 01:38:47.580
even more bleak than what is falsely

01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.580
attributed to her. The book is called

01:38:49.580 --> 01:38:51.580
Intercourse. She wrote a book called Intercourse.

01:38:51.580 --> 01:38:53.580
Imagine writing a book called Intercourse.

01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:55.580
I can actually easily imagine that, never mind.

01:38:55.580 --> 01:38:57.580
So this is an argument about the

01:38:57.580 --> 01:38:59.580
meaning of sex. Penetration

01:38:59.580 --> 01:39:01.580
to be specific. Dworkin

01:39:01.580 --> 01:39:03.580
argues that penetration expresses

01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:05.580
domination, invasion,

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:07.580
occupation, possession, contempt,

01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:09.580
degradation. So it's

01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:11.580
against the Freudian male

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:13.580
castration anxiety interpretation

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.580
where it's, you know, fear of

01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:17.580
being devoured by the woman.

01:39:17.580 --> 01:39:19.580
Imagine being afraid of that. Imagine

01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:21.580
being afraid of that. I'm gonna get a

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:23.580
facelift someday, and I'm

01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:25.580
gonna look like this.

01:39:25.580 --> 01:39:27.580
I'm perfect.

01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.580
I certainly don't agree,

01:39:29.580 --> 01:39:31.580
with everything she says, but isn't

01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:33.580
Dworkin closer to the truth here? Closer than

01:39:33.580 --> 01:39:35.580
Freud, anyway. You know, think about what men

01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:37.580
typically say to women during

01:39:37.580 --> 01:39:39.580
the act. Do they say,

01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:41.580
Help, I'm being devoured.

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:43.580
Never heard that one. Have you?

01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:45.580
No, usually it's more along the lines of

01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:47.580
You like that, don't you?

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:49.580
You little... Etc. And of course

01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:51.580
you can eroticize being subjugated

01:39:51.580 --> 01:39:53.580
and degraded, and enjoy it.

01:39:53.580 --> 01:39:55.580
And I think Dworkin would argue that most women

01:39:55.580 --> 01:39:57.580
do eroticize subjugation because

01:39:57.580 --> 01:39:59.580
they're taught to. But enjoying it

01:39:59.580 --> 01:40:01.580
she'd have to say, doesn't

01:40:01.580 --> 01:40:03.580
change the meaning of what's happening.

01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:05.580
So I think Dworkin says some things that are

01:40:05.580 --> 01:40:07.580
very true, and some things that are off the fucking rails.

01:40:07.580 --> 01:40:09.580
Where she loses me is where she

01:40:09.580 --> 01:40:11.580
starts getting blackpilled, and this book,

01:40:11.580 --> 01:40:13.580
this is the feminist blackpill.

01:40:13.580 --> 01:40:15.580
It is 250 pages of

01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:17.580
hopeless misery and rage. She

01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:19.580
says, Male-dominant gender

01:40:19.580 --> 01:40:21.580
hierarchy seems immune to

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:23.580
reform. This may be because

01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:25.580
intercourse itself is immune

01:40:25.580 --> 01:40:27.580
to reform. Uh, okay, so

01:40:27.580 --> 01:40:29.580
women will never be free, and

01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:31.580
until men stop putting the P in the V.

01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:33.580
We can dream, Andrea.

01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:35.580
We can dream! Like

01:40:35.580 --> 01:40:37.580
most ideology of resentment, this book

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:39.580
is totally dismissive of any

01:40:39.580 --> 01:40:41.580
plausible reforms that might

01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:43.580
actually improve the situation of women.

01:40:43.580 --> 01:40:45.580
Instead, preferring to wallow in the

01:40:45.580 --> 01:40:47.580
endless violence, filth, and

01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.580
objection of it all. I also think it's

01:40:49.580 --> 01:40:51.580
symptomatic that Dworkin identifies as a

01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:53.580
lesbian, but in that second wave

01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:55.580
political way. Quoting from

01:40:55.580 --> 01:40:57.580
the foreword, to Dworkin, it was a

01:40:57.580 --> 01:40:59.580
badge of rebellion against the patriarch

01:40:59.580 --> 01:41:01.580
hierarchy. In 30 plus years of knowing

01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:03.580
her, I've never heard of a single romance

01:41:03.580 --> 01:41:05.580
with a woman not one. This is not

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:07.580
surprising to me from the author of a

01:41:07.580 --> 01:41:09.580
250 page book about sex

01:41:09.580 --> 01:41:11.580
that not once pauses to even

01:41:11.580 --> 01:41:13.580
imagine the possibility of

01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:15.580
intimacy between women. Because it's not a

01:41:15.580 --> 01:41:17.580
lesbianism that's about saying yes to

01:41:17.580 --> 01:41:19.580
women. It's a lesbianism that's about

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:21.580
saying no to men. You know, people

01:41:21.580 --> 01:41:23.580
think that lesbians are the biggest man haters,

01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:25.580
but I don't think that's true. I think

01:41:25.580 --> 01:41:27.580
lesbians just don't think

01:41:27.580 --> 01:41:29.580
about men that much. The only men I

01:41:29.580 --> 01:41:31.580
think about are Fred Nietzsche and

01:41:31.580 --> 01:41:33.580
Oedipus the King.

01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:35.580
It's straight women who are usually the real

01:41:35.580 --> 01:41:37.580
man haters, because they're stuck with this.

01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:39.580
And love is closer to hatred

01:41:39.580 --> 01:41:41.580
than neutrality. So what does Andrea Dworkin

01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:43.580
actually want? What would she say

01:41:43.580 --> 01:41:45.580
yes to, if she said yes to anything?

01:41:45.580 --> 01:41:47.580
Sometimes women have trouble saying what they want,

01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.580
because no one ever told them they could.

01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.580
Romance. That's what Joan

01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:53.580
Didion said is the real desire of the women's

01:41:53.580 --> 01:41:55.580
movement. Joan Didion, of course, being

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:57.580
not like other girls. Dworkin offers occasional

01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:59.580
glimpses of a positive desire.

01:41:59.580 --> 01:42:01.580
Despite all efforts to socialize

01:42:01.580 --> 01:42:03.580
women to one intercourse, women still

01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:05.580
want a more diffuse and tender sensuality

01:42:05.580 --> 01:42:07.580
that involves the whole body in a

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:09.580
polymorphous tenderness. That does sound

01:42:09.580 --> 01:42:11.580
nice. I'm so lonely.

01:42:11.580 --> 01:42:13.580
I think it's a bit bold to speak

01:42:13.580 --> 01:42:15.580
for all women, though. Like, there are

01:42:15.580 --> 01:42:17.580
definitely women out there who, uh,

01:42:17.580 --> 01:42:19.580
they don't make love. Anastasia,

01:42:19.580 --> 01:42:21.580
they f***

01:42:21.580 --> 01:42:23.580
hard. I'm really sleepy, and

01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.580
this bed right behind me just looks

01:42:25.580 --> 01:42:27.580
so nice. Get in here right now.

01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:29.580
What if I just go to sleep?

01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:31.580
And then wake up, and then just record

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:33.580
the rest of the video when I wake up. I don't want to do it

01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.580
now. I'll get Pikachu. That'll make this easier.

01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:37.580
Isn't it better for me to have a friend?

01:42:37.580 --> 01:42:39.580
Pikachu is the most adorable Pokemon.

01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:41.580
Why? Because he's the yellowest.

01:42:41.580 --> 01:42:43.580
Name one thing more yellow than Pikachu.

01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:45.580
You can't name anything. You can't think of anything.

01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:47.580
So if diffuse and tender sensuality

01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.580
is what you want, then just

01:42:49.580 --> 01:42:51.580
say that. Is that what you want, Pikachu?

01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:53.580
I bet it is.

01:42:53.580 --> 01:42:55.580
And Dworkin did get married.

01:42:55.580 --> 01:42:57.580
To a gay man. So I

01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:59.580
guess she found what she wanted.

01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:01.580
Lucky.

01:43:01.580 --> 01:43:03.580
Envying

01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:05.580
Andrea Dworkin. Is that really what we've

01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:07.580
sunk to around here? You know, I've been noticing

01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:09.580
the poison creeping

01:43:09.580 --> 01:43:11.580
into my mind lately. I know this isn't

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:13.580
very original, but I had

01:43:13.580 --> 01:43:15.580
a bad year. You know, I fell in love with my

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:17.580
best friend like a gay idiot,

01:43:17.580 --> 01:43:19.580
got my heart comprehensively

01:43:19.580 --> 01:43:21.580
broken, and then COVID hit

01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:23.580
and gave me a year of solitude

01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:25.580
to spiral deeper

01:43:25.580 --> 01:43:27.580
into a hell of my own making.

01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:29.580
You know, I stopped saying yes to life.

01:43:29.580 --> 01:43:31.580
And I started saying yes to chasing

01:43:31.580 --> 01:43:33.580
the dragon. By which I mean

01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:35.580
playing Spyro the Dragon. One of the

01:43:35.580 --> 01:43:37.580
greatest appropriate for all ages

01:43:37.580 --> 01:43:39.580
video games of all time.

01:43:39.580 --> 01:43:41.580
Look at him gooooooo

01:43:41.580 --> 01:43:43.580
I'm taking the hair clips out. I catch

01:43:43.580 --> 01:43:45.580
myself having bitter spinster thoughts.

01:43:45.580 --> 01:43:47.580
It's because I'm trans.

01:43:47.580 --> 01:43:49.580
It's because I'm gay. That's

01:43:49.580 --> 01:43:51.580
why I'll die alone. Yeah, that's the reason

01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:53.580
I'm alone. Definitely not because I don't

01:43:53.580 --> 01:43:55.580
leave the house. See, I am not immune

01:43:55.580 --> 01:43:57.580
to incel-tier

01:43:57.580 --> 01:43:59.580
brain poisoning. And you really can't

01:43:59.580 --> 01:44:01.580
use political theorizing as

01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:03.580
an excuse not to fix your

01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:05.580
life. Society did

01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:07.580
this to me. A transphobic

01:44:07.580 --> 01:44:09.580
society made me hate myself.

01:44:09.580 --> 01:44:11.580
Well,

01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:13.580
yeah, that's true.

01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:15.580
But at a certain point, you have

01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:17.580
to take responsibility for your own

01:44:17.580 --> 01:44:19.580
mind, and decide to stop being

01:44:19.580 --> 01:44:21.580
an accomplice in your own annihilation.

01:44:21.580 --> 01:44:23.580
Since we keep referencing Paradise Lost,

01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:25.580
the mind is its own place, and in

01:44:25.580 --> 01:44:27.580
itself can make a heaven of hell a hell of

01:44:27.580 --> 01:44:29.580
heaven. Yeah, squad. So I asked

01:44:29.580 --> 01:44:31.580
myself, what kind of mind

01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:33.580
do I want to be? Do I want to obsess

01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:35.580
over what I lack? Concede

01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:37.580
society's judgment of my inferiority?

01:44:37.580 --> 01:44:39.580
Become a self-hating, self-pitying,

01:44:39.580 --> 01:44:41.580
envious, resentful little

01:44:41.580 --> 01:44:43.580
nothing? Or, do I want

01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.580
to get off the goddamn

01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:47.580
floor, stop chasing the dragon,

01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:49.580
and say yes to life?

01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:51.580
The answer, of course, is that

01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:53.580
I long to return to the sweet womb

01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:55.580
of my dark mother. But we're not gonna do

01:44:55.580 --> 01:44:57.580
that, because there's plenty of time to numb

01:44:57.580 --> 01:44:59.580
the pain after you die. The sweet

01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:01.580
embrace of death is the darkest mother of all.

01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:03.580
Also, nothing is

01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:05.580
less attractive than an

01:45:05.580 --> 01:45:07.580
envious, resentful,

01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:09.580
self-pitying person. It's beyond

01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:11.580
a personality flaw. It's

01:45:11.580 --> 01:45:13.580
a personality deformity

01:45:13.580 --> 01:45:15.580
that can ruin whatever chance at happiness

01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:17.580
you have. So, in the short

01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:19.580
time that you're alive, you have to

01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.580
discover that which is noble

01:45:21.580 --> 01:45:23.580
in yourself, and say yes to it.

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:25.580
You know, don't say no to getting older.

01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:27.580
Say yes to being a MILF.

01:45:27.580 --> 01:45:29.580
Yes. Yes.

01:45:29.580 --> 01:45:31.580
What I'm really trying to say here is

01:45:31.580 --> 01:45:33.580
Spongebob Squarepants is the

01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:35.580
ubermensch. Spongebob says

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:37.580
yes to life, and so should we.

01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:39.580
Yes to ourselves. Yes to

01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:41.580
art. Yes to sensuality.

01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:43.580
Yes to the world. Yes.

01:45:43.580 --> 01:45:45.580
Yes.

01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:47.580
We.

01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:49.580
Is this really how we're ending the video?

01:45:49.580 --> 01:45:51.580
I guess.

01:45:51.580 --> 01:45:53.580
Okay, bye!

01:45:59.580 --> 01:46:09.580
Oh, so what

01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:11.580
if my fantasies make no sense? You wanna

01:46:11.580 --> 01:46:13.580
talk about things that don't make sense?

01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:15.580
Heterosexuality. Let's put that under the microscope,

01:46:15.580 --> 01:46:17.580
hmm? You want me to believe

01:46:17.580 --> 01:46:19.580
that a straight woman who knows

01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.580
the difference between magenta and mauve

01:46:21.580 --> 01:46:23.580
is gonna date a straight man

01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:25.580
who thinks it's gay to wash his underwear,

01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:27.580
and that's just gonna work out fine.

01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:29.580
You think it's safe to raise a child in that

01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:31.580
environment? I don't think so.

01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:33.580
Not on my watch.

01:46:33.580 --> 01:46:35.580
See, I think straight men should date each other.

01:46:35.580 --> 01:46:37.580
They can sit on the couch all day playing Xbox

01:46:37.580 --> 01:46:39.580
and then each other. And then straight women

01:46:39.580 --> 01:46:41.580
can pair off, decoupage

01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:43.580
some shit, and eat each other out.

01:46:43.580 --> 01:46:45.580
Isn't that better? Isn't that more

01:46:45.580 --> 01:46:47.580
rational? I wish I could wiggle these cat ears.

01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:49.580
Like, I wish I had anatomical

01:46:49.580 --> 01:46:51.580
control over them. Hello?

01:46:51.580 --> 01:46:53.580
Yes, Dr. Spiegel?

01:46:53.580 --> 01:46:55.580
Yes, it's me again.

01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:57.580
I have a suggestion. What do we even have here?

01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:59.580
We've got tuna, salmon,

01:46:59.580 --> 01:47:01.580
some squid,

01:47:01.580 --> 01:47:03.580
mackerel, shrimp,

01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:05.580
some, I think it's yellowtail,

01:47:05.580 --> 01:47:07.580
clam,

01:47:07.580 --> 01:47:09.580
some rolls. I've never been as much into rolls.

01:47:09.580 --> 01:47:11.580
I'm a cat, you know, I like fish.

01:47:11.580 --> 01:47:13.580
You start adding too much avocado and rice into things.

01:47:13.580 --> 01:47:15.580
It's an affront to my

01:47:15.580 --> 01:47:17.580
feline nature.

01:47:29.580 --> 01:47:33.580
Yes, I'm sure.

01:47:33.580 --> 01:47:35.580
To make sure it's not too much,

01:47:35.580 --> 01:47:37.580
get the phone ready,

01:47:37.580 --> 01:47:39.580
you find a place where

01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:42.640
you can actually

01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:44.640
eat them.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:59.480
Give you some

01:47:59.580 --> 01:48:12.060
Thank you for watching!

01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:15.760
Doctor, I think if a breeze comes into the window, I could die.
