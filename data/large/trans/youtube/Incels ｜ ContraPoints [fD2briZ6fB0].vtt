00:00.000 --> 00:11.400
Imagine how a woman feels. Imagine how soft and warm her skin feels. Imagine the

00:11.400 --> 00:17.520
sweet smell of her perfume. Imagine her tenderly pressing her soft lips against

00:17.520 --> 00:22.600
yours. Imagine her letting you get on top of her and insert your p***s inside her,

00:22.600 --> 00:31.660
softly moaning as it slides in. Imagine the walls of her tight, soft, warm p***s wrapped

00:31.660 --> 00:38.180
around every inch of your c***. Imagine her breathing getting heavier with every

00:38.180 --> 00:44.100
thrust. Imagine her wrapping her arms and legs around you, holding you as close as

00:44.100 --> 00:51.480
she possibly can and begging you to c*** inside her as you release every ounce of

00:51.480 --> 00:52.580
your c***.

00:52.600 --> 01:00.500
Then imagine the feeling of pure satisfaction and peace that comes afterwards and looking

01:00.500 --> 01:10.840
beside you to see a person that cares about you and has accepted you in the most intimate

01:10.840 --> 01:12.940
way possible.

01:12.940 --> 01:21.820
You will never get to experience this because your skeleton is too small or the bones in

01:21.820 --> 01:22.580
your face are too small.

01:22.580 --> 01:23.880
You will never get to experience this because you are not the proper shape.

01:23.880 --> 01:24.880
You will never get to experience this because you are not the proper shape.

01:24.880 --> 01:25.880
Have a nice day.

01:25.880 --> 01:26.880
Hello boys.

01:26.880 --> 01:27.880
Let's talk about bone structure.

01:27.880 --> 01:47.460
There is something basically Soviet about the way the internet names things.

01:47.460 --> 01:50.700
Stalin had portmanteaus like Agitprop, Politburo and Kompromat.

01:50.700 --> 01:51.700
And we have Wevelet.

01:51.700 --> 01:52.460
You know.

01:52.460 --> 01:56.780
webinar, podcast, and incel, short for involuntary celibate.

01:56.780 --> 01:58.980
The word incel was invented in the late 90s

01:58.980 --> 02:01.320
by a lonely bisexual called Alana,

02:01.320 --> 02:02.660
who created a website called

02:02.660 --> 02:05.220
Alana's Involuntary Celibacy Project

02:05.220 --> 02:06.760
that was essentially a safe space

02:06.760 --> 02:09.420
for people who just couldn't get it in.

02:09.420 --> 02:12.040
But in our own miserable moment of internet history,

02:12.040 --> 02:15.000
the word incel refers to a more specific community

02:15.000 --> 02:18.220
of mostly heterosexual men centered around forums

02:18.220 --> 02:21.180
like incel.me and r slash brain cells.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.860
This group has recently gotten a lot of bad press

02:23.860 --> 02:25.120
because for the last few years,

02:25.120 --> 02:26.700
they've been churning out mass murderers

02:26.700 --> 02:29.040
faster than Marvel can make Avengers movies.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.080
But most incels aren't violent killers.

02:31.080 --> 02:33.420
They're just men who've formed an identity

02:33.420 --> 02:34.780
around not getting laid.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.860
In this video, I don't want to mock incels

02:36.860 --> 02:39.680
or lecture them or even sympathize with them.

02:39.680 --> 02:41.700
I just want to understand who they are

02:41.700 --> 02:43.120
and why they're like this.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.840
To start with, sometimes the best way

02:44.840 --> 02:47.700
to understand a person's world is to learn their language.

02:47.700 --> 02:50.120
And the language of the incels,

02:50.120 --> 02:50.960
well,

02:51.180 --> 02:52.700
you'll see.

02:52.700 --> 02:55.160
First base, incelese.

02:55.160 --> 02:57.180
Does it ever bother you that the word women

02:57.180 --> 03:00.620
makes adult females sound just a little bit too human?

03:00.620 --> 03:02.540
Well, incels have a solution to that.

03:02.540 --> 03:05.040
They've taken to calling women femoines.

03:07.700 --> 03:09.240
The choice of vocabulary tells us

03:09.240 --> 03:10.640
how incels think of women,

03:10.640 --> 03:12.180
not as sisters or mothers

03:12.180 --> 03:13.960
and certainly not as autonomous people,

03:13.960 --> 03:16.580
but as a kind of foreign and scrutable object

03:16.580 --> 03:19.440
comparable to a natural resource, an optenium,

03:19.440 --> 03:20.820
to which incels believe all men

03:21.180 --> 03:22.440
are entitled and to which they feel

03:22.440 --> 03:24.140
they have been unjustly denied.

03:24.140 --> 03:25.720
There's a long tradition of nerdy men

03:25.720 --> 03:29.300
talking about women in nerdily misogynistic ways.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.340
I'm reminded of famed rocket scientist

03:31.340 --> 03:34.500
Werner von Braun's remark about female astronauts.

03:34.500 --> 03:38.940
We are reserving 110 pounds of payload

03:38.940 --> 03:40.940
for recreational equipment.

03:40.940 --> 03:42.680
Which is not to say that alpha males

03:42.680 --> 03:44.920
are less misogynistic than nerds,

03:44.920 --> 03:48.380
but simply that nerds have a nerdy style of misogyny.

03:48.380 --> 03:51.180
Now, femoid is about as neutral a term as incels have,

03:51.180 --> 03:53.780
for women, and it's only downhill from there.

03:53.780 --> 03:57.080
There's the usual standbys, bitches, sluts, whores,

03:57.080 --> 04:00.400
all conveying a searing resentment of female sexuality,

04:00.400 --> 04:02.400
the pinnacle of which is represented

04:02.400 --> 04:05.260
by the bespoke incel coinage, roasty,

04:05.260 --> 04:06.500
which I'm sorry to inform you,

04:06.500 --> 04:09.100
refers to the incel belief that the human vulva

04:09.100 --> 04:11.380
become mutilated through repeated penetration

04:11.380 --> 04:14.200
by different men, though not through repeated penetration

04:14.200 --> 04:15.800
by the same man, interestingly,

04:15.800 --> 04:18.280
and thereby come to resemble roast beef.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.700
Now, by definition, incels haven't actually observed

04:20.700 --> 04:23.840
any vaginas, but to incels, anatomy is more a matter

04:23.840 --> 04:26.520
of metaphysical speculation than crude science.

04:26.520 --> 04:28.200
Though if you ask me, the right metaphor

04:28.200 --> 04:32.020
for a veteran vag is not roast beef, but sour grapes.

04:34.080 --> 04:37.680
Of course, not all femoids are created equal.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.760
There are various subspecies.

04:39.760 --> 04:43.980
The becky, or normie, femoid is to be contrasted

04:43.980 --> 04:47.520
with the stacy, or sexually desirable femoid,

04:47.520 --> 04:50.700
whose distinguishing features include makeup,

04:50.700 --> 04:52.900
a slightly more masculine look,

04:52.900 --> 04:54.400
a more masculine style of hair,

04:54.400 --> 04:56.060
and a more Improvised look.

04:56.060 --> 04:59.140
Stacy, on point, never works a day in her life.

04:59.140 --> 05:02.820
Naturally curvy body gives men instant erections,

05:02.820 --> 05:06.020
big tits and ass show fertility.

05:06.020 --> 05:08.000
Leave my buns alone, you savages!

05:08.000 --> 05:10.320
The stacy, naturally, has a male counterpart,

05:10.320 --> 05:12.580
whom incels call the chad.

05:12.580 --> 05:17.480
A chad is a hunky alpha whose hands are always prepared

05:17.480 --> 05:19.840
to grab nearby fertile pussy.

05:19.840 --> 05:23.100
He has a sloped forehead with a strong brow,

05:23.640 --> 05:28.600
ram-bow chin, strong jawline, flat occipital plate.

05:28.600 --> 05:32.740
It must needs be remarked that the skull of the Chad

05:32.740 --> 05:35.720
exhibiteth a brow-ridge most pronounced,

05:36.200 --> 05:41.040
whereas the skull of the Virgin is most inadequate in this regard,

05:41.380 --> 05:47.940
predisposing such specimens to an abject existence of lamentation and cuckoldry.

05:47.940 --> 05:50.020
It's time to talk about bone structure.

05:50.300 --> 05:51.940
According to a classic incel meme,

05:51.940 --> 05:58.780
The difference between Chad and non-Chad is literally a few millimeters of bone.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.920
I would like to propose a sociological theory.

06:02.380 --> 06:03.320
Farpington's Law.

06:03.820 --> 06:06.680
Once bigotry or self-loathing permeate a given community,

06:07.140 --> 06:10.220
it is only a matter of time before deep metaphysical significance

06:10.220 --> 06:13.100
is assigned to the shape of human skulls.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.060
Why skulls, you ask?

06:15.340 --> 06:17.920
Well, the best explanation I can come up with

06:17.920 --> 06:21.320
is that a skull is inanimate and unchangeable.

06:21.320 --> 06:25.360
It's therefore the perfect symbol of the intrinsic and permanent characteristics

06:25.360 --> 06:28.400
that bigots like to assign to certain groups of people.

06:28.760 --> 06:32.720
If you believe, for example, that a certain race or gender is intellectually inferior,

06:33.280 --> 06:37.540
you can justify your belief by pointing to the shape of a skull and saying,

06:37.940 --> 06:40.100
Well, that's the reason why.

06:40.320 --> 06:41.300
It's just nature.

06:41.660 --> 06:43.280
There's nothing that can be done about it.

06:43.480 --> 06:47.520
And that is exactly the way incels think about love and celibacy.

06:47.920 --> 06:50.060
Mankind is divided into two groups of people.

06:50.280 --> 06:51.940
The chads with the fuckable skulls

06:51.940 --> 06:55.120
and the incels whose bones come up a few millimeters short.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.860
Corndog, anyone?

06:58.300 --> 06:58.940
I'm really hungry.

06:59.900 --> 07:02.940
Of course, it's not just the skulls the incels blame for their sexlessness.

07:03.340 --> 07:07.360
They have a whole dictionary of jargon explaining the causes of involuntary celibacy.

07:07.620 --> 07:10.080
Height cells are inceled due to their inferior stature,

07:10.080 --> 07:14.240
whereas mental cells can't attract women because of mental illness or autism,

07:14.600 --> 07:17.160
or they're addicts and then called drug cells.

07:17.920 --> 07:22.240
Wrist cells, on the other hand, are doomed by their overly delicate wrists.

07:22.240 --> 07:26.020
Now, obsessing about your wrist size does seem a little weird.

07:26.020 --> 07:26.520
Oh, yeah?

07:26.520 --> 07:31.240
Is it a little weird that the average dildo has more girth than my wrist?

07:31.240 --> 07:35.040
Is it weird at all that some men have thicker dicks than my wrist?

07:35.040 --> 07:36.580
But yeah, obviously,

07:36.580 --> 07:43.160
obsessing about my tiny wrists that are smaller than even many women's is completely irrational body dysmorphia.

07:43.160 --> 07:47.200
And the reason why no one wants to be with me or even talk to me is my shitty personality.

07:47.200 --> 07:47.800
Even though,

07:47.800 --> 07:53.300
literal 80 IQ men who have nothing to talk about except who won the game last night

07:53.300 --> 07:56.000
are still able to attract a loving partner.

07:57.680 --> 07:58.180
Interesting.

07:58.180 --> 08:00.680
A significant number of incels are not white,

08:00.680 --> 08:03.580
in which case their unfuckability is attributed to race,

08:03.580 --> 08:06.460
and they are accordingly termed apologies in advance,

08:06.460 --> 08:07.460
black cells,

08:08.680 --> 08:11.180
rice cells, curry cells, and so on.

08:11.180 --> 08:13.840
Which is not to say that all non-white men are celibate.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.800
There are, of course, the occasional chads of color with their superior skills,

08:17.800 --> 08:19.600
skulls, and towering stature,

08:19.600 --> 08:24.840
whom the incels have christened Tyrones, Changs, and Chadpreets.

08:24.840 --> 08:26.640
I'm so sorry.

08:26.640 --> 08:30.640
So you can be incel because of your looks, your height, your mind, or your race,

08:30.640 --> 08:34.960
but what unites them all is the conviction that love and sex are forever out of reach.

08:34.960 --> 08:38.800
Unless, of course, you delusionally imagine that you can ascend,

08:38.800 --> 08:40.920
that is, escape your inceldom.

08:40.920 --> 08:45.380
If you falsely and pathetically believe that there is any possibility of improvement,

08:45.380 --> 08:47.680
well, that makes you the lowest of the low.

08:47.680 --> 08:50.260
A sad and sorry hope-cel.

08:50.980 --> 08:53.980
Second base, the red pill.

08:53.980 --> 08:56.520
So we have the building blocks of the incel worldview,

08:56.520 --> 08:59.980
the stacys, the chads, the incels, and the normies.

08:59.980 --> 09:05.060
From these elements, incels have constructed a theory of human nature and sexuality,

09:05.060 --> 09:07.140
which they call the red pill.

09:07.140 --> 09:10.440
Incels share the red pill worldview with the rest of the manosphere,

09:10.440 --> 09:13.380
that is, pick-up artists, men's rights activists,

09:13.380 --> 09:17.060
and the voluntary celibate community known as Men Going Their Own Way,

09:17.060 --> 09:18.440
abbreviated MGTOW.

09:18.440 --> 09:22.100
According to red pill theory, women are by nature hypergamous.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.760
Hypergamy, new Greek for marrying above,

09:24.760 --> 09:29.180
refers to the practice of seeking relationships with men above one's social status,

09:29.180 --> 09:32.760
and also, in incel usage, above one's attractiveness.

09:32.760 --> 09:38.140
According to incels, physical attractiveness is naturally distributed equally between the sexes.

09:38.140 --> 09:43.260
So, if you were to assign numerical ratings to attractiveness, as incels like to do,

09:43.260 --> 09:46.360
there would be about as many, say, 8 out of 10 women, as 8 out of 10 men.

09:46.360 --> 09:54.160
Incels believe that in a just world, a 5 out of 10 man would naturally wind up in a relationship with his looks match,

09:54.160 --> 09:58.480
that is, a 5 out of 10 woman, equivalently attractive to himself.

09:58.480 --> 10:02.480
But sadly, this just system has been ruined by hypergamous women,

10:02.480 --> 10:07.160
who, regardless of their own attractiveness, are only interested in dating Chad.

10:07.160 --> 10:09.700
Incels sometimes call this the 80-20 rule,

10:09.700 --> 10:13.980
the idea that only the top 20% of men will ever be desired by women.

10:13.980 --> 10:15.900
Now, since most heterosexual men do end up being attracted to men,

10:15.900 --> 10:20.140
you might be raising your eyebrow at that idea.

10:20.140 --> 10:22.140
But incels have an explanation.

10:22.140 --> 10:28.480
According to the red pill theory, women often pursue a mating strategy called alpha-fucks-beta-bucks.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.900
This means that in her 20s, a woman will, as incels say,

10:31.900 --> 10:35.700
ride the cock carousel, sleeping with as many chads as possible.

10:35.700 --> 10:40.740
But as she ages into her 30s, she will settle down with a beta-normie whom she's not really attracted to,

10:40.740 --> 10:42.900
but whom she will use for financial support,

10:42.900 --> 10:45.700
all the while continuously cuckolding him on the alpha-cock carousel.

10:45.900 --> 10:50.900
Before inevitably abandoning him, taking him for everything he's worth in a divorce settlement,

10:50.900 --> 10:54.600
and running off to the Mediterranean with all the children and a new chad boyfriend,

10:54.600 --> 10:59.820
while the beta-cock is left behind to fester in alimony payments, solitude, and poverty.

10:59.820 --> 11:04.060
So the upshot of the red pill theory is that for men, there are three possible outcomes.

11:04.060 --> 11:08.060
Either you're an incel, doomed to a lifetime of excruciating loneliness and resentment,

11:08.060 --> 11:12.240
or you're a normie, destined to wind up in a sexless marriage with an unfaithful wife,

11:12.240 --> 11:15.860
who will divorce you, win custody of the children, and run off with all your money.

11:15.900 --> 11:20.980
Or you could be an alpha, an independent, promiscuous man,

11:20.980 --> 11:24.660
who sleeps with lots of women and forms attachments to none of them.

11:24.660 --> 11:27.780
In the red pill philosophy, there are two ways to become alpha.

11:27.780 --> 11:30.480
The first is simply to be a chad by nature.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.900
The second is to become a pickup artist.

11:32.900 --> 11:37.400
Red-pilled pickup artists believe basically the same things about women that incels believe,

11:37.400 --> 11:42.200
that they are hypergamous, duplicitous, and fuckable, but not lovable.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.780
The difference is that pickup artists are not celibate.

11:44.780 --> 11:45.900
In fact, they try to have sex with women.

11:45.900 --> 11:49.400
They try to have sex with as many women as possible by following a series of strategies

11:49.400 --> 11:53.920
and scripts known as game, as described by the book of that title, as well as by the

11:53.920 --> 11:59.480
red-pilled pickup artist, Roosh V, author of a book called Bang, a new mascara from

11:59.480 --> 12:00.480
Benefit.

12:00.480 --> 12:05.940
So, the tube is bomb, I am living, let's see what the wand looks like.

12:05.940 --> 12:08.080
Oh.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.080
It's so big.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.680
I wonder what Roosh is up to lately.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.140
I bake my own bread.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.780
Yes, I am outing myself as a baker.

12:14.780 --> 12:16.540
As someone who likes to cook.

12:16.540 --> 12:17.960
I'm not a woman.

12:17.960 --> 12:23.980
I am ultra-masculine as you can see, but baking and cooking in general is a scientific thing.

12:23.980 --> 12:25.500
And men like scientific things.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.960
I used to be a, a scientist.

12:27.960 --> 12:28.960
Well, Roosh, you know what?

12:28.960 --> 12:33.880
If it means you leave women alone, I hope you enjoy your new life as an ultra-masculine

12:33.880 --> 12:34.880
baker.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.780
Sorry, I mean bread scientist.

12:37.780 --> 12:42.020
So remember, the red pill is the realization that women are hypergamous by nature, 20%

12:42.020 --> 12:44.020
or less of men are really attractive to women.

12:44.020 --> 12:48.460
Dating is a sexual marketplace, and feminism is a pretext for enabling women to behave

12:48.460 --> 12:52.420
however they want while consigning men to emasculation and impotence.

12:52.420 --> 12:56.260
The black pill is the additional realization that one's place in the sexual marketplace

12:56.260 --> 13:00.620
is genetically determined, that one is a permanent virgin, that sex and relationships are forever

13:00.620 --> 13:04.180
out of reach, and hence that happiness is impossible, and there's nothing one can

13:04.180 --> 13:06.720
do except lie down and rot.

13:06.720 --> 13:11.700
The black pill is essentially dogmatic hopelessness about dating, and about life in general.

13:11.700 --> 13:12.920
It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call sexism.

13:12.920 --> 13:13.920
It's the pinnacle of what psychotherapists call sexism.

13:14.020 --> 13:18.660
It's called catastrophizing, a cognitive distortion where anxiety or depression leads

13:18.660 --> 13:23.180
you to infer apocalyptic conclusions from mundane setbacks and anxieties.

13:23.180 --> 13:26.800
For instance, a catastrophizing person might begin with the thought, oh no, I'm gonna

13:26.800 --> 13:30.580
be late for work, and from there infer, my boss is gonna be angry, I'm gonna lose

13:30.580 --> 13:34.180
my job, I'm not gonna be able to get another job, I'm gonna be unemployed forever, my

13:34.180 --> 13:36.640
family will starve, oh god, we're all gonna die.

13:36.640 --> 13:41.640
Each step in this sequence is sort of plausible, but the leap from step one to step seven is

13:41.640 --> 13:42.640
completely absurd.

13:42.640 --> 13:43.640
This is exactly how the black pill works.

13:43.640 --> 13:47.800
You start with experiences of rejection and isolation.

13:47.800 --> 13:51.160
From there, you infer that you are unattractive to women, that you will never be attractive

13:51.160 --> 13:54.920
to any woman, that you will be forever alone, that you will always be unhappy, that women

13:54.920 --> 13:58.700
did this to you, that feminism empowered women to do this to you, that the social trends

13:58.700 --> 14:02.180
that made this possible are only getting worse, that humanity itself is doomed and your only

14:02.180 --> 14:03.680
option is to lie down and rot.

14:03.680 --> 14:07.440
Of course, not all incels take things quite so far, but a lot of them do.

14:07.440 --> 14:12.360
On incel forums, suicidal ideation is very common, and posts are often tagged suafuel

14:12.360 --> 14:13.360
or ropefuel.

14:13.640 --> 14:17.220
This is what they make you want to kill yourself, usually because they're reminders of how hopeless

14:17.220 --> 14:21.680
the incel situation is, or how devastating it is that incels are missing out on the incredible

14:21.680 --> 14:23.400
bliss of sex and romance.

14:23.400 --> 14:28.180
Now if you suggest to incels that posting suafuel on forums already populated by lonely

14:28.180 --> 14:33.160
and depressed people is maybe not the most responsible idea, they respond that oh it's

14:33.160 --> 14:37.700
just dark humor, it's just a cope, throw us a bone here, but a lot of the suicidal stuff

14:37.700 --> 14:41.980
shows no signs of humor, and it's common to see people express pretty extreme states of

14:41.980 --> 14:42.800
depression, which is not surprising.

14:43.640 --> 14:47.760
Since hopelessness is the logical conclusion of the black-pill worldview.

14:47.760 --> 14:52.000
One's possibility for happiness is determined by the genetics of height, frame, and facial

14:52.000 --> 14:53.000
bone structure.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.740
And if you don't have these gifts, there's no relief but to cope or rope.

14:56.740 --> 14:59.840
Now it's pretty tempting to just mom the shit out of these kids.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.940
You want to grab them by their black ops t-shirts, shake them a bit, and tell them there are

15:03.940 --> 15:07.140
millions of men with small wrists and weak chins getting laid every day, that they're

15:07.140 --> 15:10.600
their own worst enemies, that they need to get off the computer, go outside, make some

15:10.600 --> 15:13.120
friends, stop hating women, get some hobbies, and who knows?

15:13.120 --> 15:13.620
Make some money.

15:13.640 --> 15:17.400
Maybe they'll develop a disposition that women find a little more approachable.

15:17.400 --> 15:20.740
Essentially, you want to tell them, clean your room, bucko.

15:20.740 --> 15:24.500
In fact, for the young men in this demographic who are receptive to that kind of advice,

15:24.500 --> 15:27.980
Jordan Peterson is probably helpful, because he's telling them a lot of what they need

15:27.980 --> 15:31.960
to hear, and he's kind of a sexist old man, so they might actually listen.

15:31.960 --> 15:34.680
But most incels don't want to hear this kind of advice.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.400
In fact, they view it as essentially a microaggression.

15:37.400 --> 15:42.260
You are, in effect, chad-splaining their oppression to them, when you give basic advice like take

15:42.260 --> 15:43.120
a shower, be more confident.

15:43.120 --> 15:48.660
To people who've already experienced a lifetime of rejection and isolation, and who believe

15:48.660 --> 15:50.260
they've already tried everything.

15:50.260 --> 15:55.140
So they despise this kind of advice, and devote endless posts to bitterly mocking the futility

15:55.140 --> 15:56.960
and insensitivity of it.

15:56.960 --> 15:58.640
Just go out to parties, bro.

15:58.640 --> 16:02.600
Instead of hating on women all day, why don't you losers just try being confident?

16:02.600 --> 16:04.920
Like this average looking guy.

16:04.920 --> 16:05.920
Confidence is key.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.860
You incels need some hobbies.

16:07.860 --> 16:09.440
Try reading some books.

16:09.440 --> 16:10.440
Women love intelligence.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.120
It works for me, bro.

16:12.120 --> 16:13.120
Aw.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.120
I need to get out.

16:14.120 --> 16:19.880
No one knows what it's like to be hated.

16:19.880 --> 16:24.340
To incels, their worldview seems ironclad, and has built-in defenses against anyone who

16:24.340 --> 16:26.040
would try to change their minds.

16:26.040 --> 16:29.880
So if you want to understand incels, and in particular, if you want to understand why

16:29.880 --> 16:34.700
their community produces so many mass murderers, you have to understand that the black pill

16:34.700 --> 16:37.560
is more than the dogma that you can't get laid.

16:37.560 --> 16:41.880
It's also the dogma that because you can't get laid, you can never be happy.

16:41.880 --> 16:42.960
So what we have in our hands here is this.

16:42.960 --> 16:46.140
It's not just a bunch of angry internet misogynists.

16:46.140 --> 16:51.780
It's at worst a kind of death cult, complete with an eternal hell and an omnipotent enemy.

16:51.780 --> 16:56.140
It is not surprising that that state of mind leads a few of them to conclude that since

16:56.140 --> 17:00.960
triumph is impossible, why not try revenge?

17:00.960 --> 17:02.220
Third base.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.220
Tinder is garbage.

17:03.220 --> 17:07.620
I know I said I wasn't going to sympathize with incels, and I know they don't want my

17:07.620 --> 17:11.960
sympathy anyway, and I know it's bad praxis to sympathize with the devil.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.160
But on some level, I can't help it.

17:14.160 --> 17:18.200
The internet is for introverts, so I'm sure a lot of people watching this feel the same

17:18.200 --> 17:19.200
way.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.380
I bet some of you have been this guy.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.200
I have been this guy.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.840
So look, I'm going to tell you something I've never really come out about on this channel,

17:25.840 --> 17:31.480
so this is like a really vulnerable moment for me, but I used to live as a man.

17:31.480 --> 17:35.560
And I'm not proud of that, but I'm ready to move on if you're ready to forgive.

17:35.560 --> 17:41.240
I'm in the unusual situation of being a woman who dates men who used to be a man who dates women.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.720
What kind of fucked up shit is that?

17:43.720 --> 17:45.140
Is that even allowed?

17:45.140 --> 17:49.020
Alright, cop down lesbian stans, I'm still attracted to women.

17:49.020 --> 17:50.640
And those who lieth betwixt.

17:50.640 --> 17:51.640
Cats.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.640
The inherent eroticism of the sea.

17:53.640 --> 17:54.640
Mmm, yeah.

17:54.640 --> 18:00.320
Don't you just want to get in there?

18:00.320 --> 18:01.320
Take me, mommy.

18:01.320 --> 18:03.200
But I have been on a heterosexual kick lately.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.780
I gotta get my hetero on.

18:04.780 --> 18:10.200
What I'm getting at is I've used Tinder both as a man seeking women and as a woman seeking

18:10.200 --> 18:11.200
men.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.380
And that gives me some relevant experiences.

18:13.380 --> 18:17.380
When you're a man, the strategy is you've gotta send a lot of messages, because women

18:17.380 --> 18:23.000
get a lot of messages, and then you just gotta try to be less of an ogre than the other fuckboys.

18:23.000 --> 18:29.220
Whereas if you're a woman, you get to lie recumbent on your chaise longue and receive

18:29.220 --> 18:30.220
the inquiries.

18:30.220 --> 18:32.440
Let's see how we're doing here.

18:32.440 --> 18:33.760
How many men have liked me on Tinder?

18:33.760 --> 18:36.880
I'm paying $30 for this information, so this better be good.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.880
I have 2,500 likes.

18:38.880 --> 18:39.880
That's a lot of Baltimore.

18:39.880 --> 18:40.880
That's a lot of Baltimore.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.900
That's a lot of Baltimore-ian men who swiped right on a tran.

18:43.900 --> 18:45.900
What a divine city.

18:45.900 --> 18:53.160
Oh, that's so nice of them to be interested in me.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.100
Let's see what kind of messages I got.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.440
Dick or no dick?

18:56.440 --> 18:58.280
Pre-op or post-op?

18:58.280 --> 18:59.700
Did you cut your dick off?

18:59.700 --> 19:01.260
Oh my god.

19:01.260 --> 19:02.880
I'm gonna cut it off, okay?

19:02.880 --> 19:03.880
Jesus.

19:03.880 --> 19:09.140
I will let you smash my pussy so, so hard if you just be patient.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.140
It's a whole process.

19:10.880 --> 19:11.880
That's not a pussy.

19:11.880 --> 19:12.880
That's a fuckhole.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.880
You'll never know what it's like to squeeze life out of your sacred passage.

19:15.880 --> 19:16.880
Well, that's true.

19:16.880 --> 19:23.940
I'm not gonna be squeezing any life out unless something goes very seriously wrong, and I

19:23.940 --> 19:28.160
assure you that none of the passages I have down there have ever been or ever will be

19:28.160 --> 19:29.160
sacred.

19:29.160 --> 19:31.160
Abigail, leave my fuckhole out of this.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.880
When I first started using this app, I was messaging with a guy who seemed super chill.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.880
He was gonna take me to a concert.

19:35.880 --> 19:36.880
I was like, it seems like a lot for a first date, but we'll try it.

19:36.880 --> 19:37.880
He was like, you know what?

19:37.880 --> 19:38.880
I don't know.

19:38.880 --> 19:39.880
I don't know.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.320
I'm gonna try it.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.720
Fifteen minutes after we agreed to that, he sends me a message.

19:44.720 --> 19:47.580
What color panties are you wearing?

19:47.580 --> 19:53.100
I would love to smell them.

19:53.100 --> 19:54.100
Can we get coffee first?

19:54.100 --> 19:58.640
The hell of it is, I probably would've let him smell my panties, but this is the thing

19:58.640 --> 20:00.020
you bring up on the third fuck.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.000
You don't open with panty sniffing.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.320
Like, the only point of in-app messaging is for me to figure out if you're gonna murder

20:05.320 --> 20:06.320
me.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.320
And you're already fucking it up.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.880
So this is the experience of women on Tinder.

20:08.880 --> 20:14.700
we're drowning in dick and most of it is terrible not all i do have some very sweet messages and i

20:14.700 --> 20:18.780
haven't been using the app in a couple months so if i didn't respond to you or if we didn't match

20:18.780 --> 20:25.200
it's not because i rejected you it's because i don't like the app people screenshot my profile

20:25.200 --> 20:30.560
and they post it online and they call me contra points and like i'm just too famous for this shit

20:30.560 --> 20:36.380
my life is hard so girls we do a lot of complaining about the firing squad of bad

20:36.380 --> 20:41.220
dicks that's constantly pointed at us in dating apps but how would you feel if instead of that

20:41.220 --> 20:46.320
you were just getting radio silence like the incels get i can't speak for other women but

20:46.320 --> 20:52.880
personally i prefer the firing squad of dicks you know at least these pricks care enough about my

20:52.880 --> 20:58.600
pussy to be an asshole about my dick i feel sorry for men on dating apps i really do you have to

20:58.600 --> 21:02.620
deal with a lot of rejection and that must be difficult these apps are especially brutal to

21:02.620 --> 21:06.360
people who aren't photogenic if you're meeting people at a bar or a party you might strike

21:06.360 --> 21:10.300
up a conversation with someone who you're not initially physically attracted to but then

21:10.300 --> 21:14.900
maybe they're super funny or charming or maybe they're attracted to me and that's an attractive

21:14.900 --> 21:20.740
quality in another person that they appreciate how beautiful i am but on tinder you're just

21:20.740 --> 21:25.980
browsing a catalog of faces and gatekeeping who even gets to talk to you in the first place

21:25.980 --> 21:30.820
red pillars have a really gross way of talking about dating in terms of sexual market value

21:30.820 --> 21:36.340
but like dating kind of is a marketplace or at least you can analyze it like one and our culture

21:36.340 --> 21:41.720
is so visual and these apps are so picture centered that bone structure like it's not the

21:41.720 --> 21:46.240
only thing that matters but it matters a great deal and this is where i do have sympathy for

21:46.240 --> 21:51.600
the incels because as a trans woman i know what it's like to obsess over millimeters of bone

21:51.600 --> 21:56.020
i actually had to interrupt work on this video to go to a consultation for facial feminization

21:56.020 --> 22:01.100
surgery so i can pay luxury car amounts of money to shave off a few millimeters of bone here and

22:01.100 --> 22:06.120
there because it must needs be remarked that the skull of the female exhibited

22:06.340 --> 22:11.060
a brow ridge less pronounced i mean i'm just as obsessed with bone structure as the goddamn

22:11.060 --> 22:15.620
men cells because i think certain parts of my face make me look like a man and i worry about

22:15.620 --> 22:20.580
it every day we're all obsessed with the bones honey we all have bones inside us we all love

22:20.580 --> 22:26.980
touching bones you want to take a measurement from the supraorbital ridge to the lambdoid suture

22:27.620 --> 22:34.660
and multiply that figure by pi to calculate what we call the chat circumference

22:35.700 --> 22:36.200
why is no one talking to me?

22:36.340 --> 22:38.180
why is no one talking about the chad circumference?

22:38.180 --> 22:44.900
fourth base just the tip there's another way i think my experience as a trans woman is relevant

22:44.900 --> 22:49.940
to the incel discussion and that's that i recognize delusional self-loathing when i see it

22:49.940 --> 22:54.820
i'm far from the first to point out that the supreme gentleman incel mass murderer elliot

22:54.820 --> 23:00.820
roger was apart from his narcissistic psychopath personality an eminently bangable twink i'm not

23:00.820 --> 23:05.700
going to show you pictures of incels but on their forums they do sometimes post selfie threads

23:05.700 --> 23:12.260
and you can't say this on incel forums without enraging them but in confidence from one pretend

23:12.260 --> 23:18.420
clinician to another let me tell you that the truth about incels is that almost all of them

23:18.420 --> 23:23.300
are completely normal looking guys but of course that's not the feedback they get from other incels

23:23.300 --> 23:26.900
the feedback they get is that their chins are weak their hair is thin their skin is

23:26.900 --> 23:30.740
garbage and there's no hope whatsoever no woman will ever love them and there are

23:30.740 --> 23:35.540
true cells with no option but to lie down and rot and the interesting thing is those guys pose for

23:35.540 --> 23:41.860
selfies to those threads knowing that's the kind of feedback they're gonna get so why why do they

23:41.860 --> 23:47.780
do it well i'll tell you a little story there is a website on the internet called 4chan.org

23:47.780 --> 23:53.780
that has a board called lgbt a few years ago this was used mainly by the 25 gay men who

23:53.780 --> 24:01.460
actually like milo yiannopoulos but recently it's used mostly by men who are entertaining

24:01.460 --> 24:05.380
the notion of becoming women and by early transition trans women

24:05.540 --> 24:11.860
the board is jokingly called tttt now i've recently moved beyond that first stage of my transition

24:11.860 --> 24:18.900
but the memory is still fresh and let me tell you it is a painful awkward humiliating stage of life

24:18.900 --> 24:24.580
so the trans women of tttt are tragic they're basically still in man mode which is why they're

24:24.580 --> 24:30.980
using 4chan and i bring them up because they remind me a lot of incels for incels the core

24:30.980 --> 24:35.520
frustration is that they can't get laid for tttt it's that they can't get laid they can't get laid

24:35.540 --> 24:39.620
they can't pass as female both groups post selfies knowing they're going to get brutal

24:39.620 --> 24:44.100
unconstructive feedback and both groups have a weird vocabulary with which to express their

24:44.100 --> 24:51.460
anxieties for instance on tttt a major piece of jargon is hun a slur used by trans women

24:51.460 --> 24:56.100
for other trans women which basically means that you look like a man in a dress

24:56.100 --> 25:00.580
which is what every trans woman is afraid of and there's another commonality with incels too

25:00.580 --> 25:04.500
with all bigots and self-loathers which if you've been paying attention

25:05.060 --> 25:05.460
you've already seen it

25:05.540 --> 25:06.180
already guessed

25:07.060 --> 25:09.940
you will never be seen as a woman because of your head size

25:09.940 --> 25:14.500
have all the surgeries in the world your massive man noggin will stay the same

25:14.500 --> 25:20.980
lel this freak thinks he has very soft facial features his head is huge lel

25:20.980 --> 25:25.140
and the huns on reddit are hug boxing him and telling him that there are women with big heads

25:25.780 --> 25:31.060
uh no there aren't there aren't women with heads that do that and ffs won't change you might

25:31.060 --> 25:35.060
as well repress you transition with a man's head you will be clocked you will be looked at as a

25:35.060 --> 25:35.460
freak

25:36.020 --> 25:37.780
will never be seen as a woman

25:37.780 --> 25:38.420
100%

25:39.220 --> 25:41.220
this is why i'm not transitioning

25:42.100 --> 25:48.660
thank you skull people for showing me the way and that no matter what i do i will always be

25:48.660 --> 25:54.980
a manly man skull wise you saved me the embarrassment of being a literal

25:54.980 --> 25:56.340
big-headed man in the dress

25:56.340 --> 26:03.060
it is evident the cranial vault of the autogynephile be much more voluminous and the

26:03.060 --> 26:04.540
facial plane wider be one with you at last rights do i hold a war Joanna uso what the real Amy wrote

26:04.540 --> 26:04.980
was that fade worse visible I liked erasными man as a female. guten like that man wouldn't crack up.

26:04.980 --> 26:08.260
It always comes back to the skulls. Every time.

26:08.260 --> 26:13.140
The other interesting thing about TTTT is I used to get posted there a lot.

26:13.140 --> 26:17.540
For a while I had some stans on the board who basically viewed me as inspiration.

26:18.180 --> 26:21.220
Yikes. Because of course that kind of post is frowned upon.

26:21.220 --> 26:25.380
If I'm not looked at as a big skulled manly freak, if my transition is going well,

26:26.740 --> 26:30.980
that means that some of their transitions might go well too.

26:30.980 --> 26:36.660
And that is an unacceptable conclusion for a community founded on self-loathing and hopelessness.

26:36.660 --> 26:40.180
So it was necessary for the rest of the board to explain why I didn't pass,

26:40.180 --> 26:43.220
why I would never pass, and why anyone who looked less good than me

26:43.220 --> 26:44.900
shouldn't even fucking think about it.

26:44.900 --> 26:47.540
They shouldn't transition at all. They should just repress.

26:47.540 --> 26:49.140
They should lie down and rot.

26:49.140 --> 26:50.740
And I used to read this stuff all the time.

26:50.740 --> 26:53.460
Like, I would specifically seek out threads about me.

26:54.020 --> 26:59.540
Which might seem strange, considering I had hundreds of fans telling me I was a gorgeous

26:59.540 --> 27:00.500
goddess every day.

27:00.500 --> 27:00.980
So,

27:00.980 --> 27:02.660
why did I turn away from that?

27:02.660 --> 27:07.940
To intentionally seek out this dismal den of Huns talking about how my giant Hun skull is

27:07.940 --> 27:13.380
clockable at a thousand paces and my voice sounds like a ridiculous Muppet falsetto hybrid

27:13.380 --> 27:15.380
of Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh.

27:15.380 --> 27:19.780
Well, basically there was part of my brain that just simply refused to believe it when

27:19.780 --> 27:21.540
people told me I was gorgeous.

27:21.540 --> 27:24.100
And for semi-plausible reasons.

27:24.100 --> 27:28.260
A lot of trans people on the internet tell other trans people they look gorgeous no matter

27:28.260 --> 27:29.220
what they look like.

27:29.220 --> 27:30.660
That's where the word Hun

27:30.660 --> 27:31.460
comes from.

27:31.460 --> 27:32.500
You look great, Hun.

27:34.260 --> 27:38.900
So what TTTT is saying about Reddit hugboxing is true to some extent.

27:38.900 --> 27:44.740
There is a kind of a priori and dogmatic flattery that prevails in some trans spaces.

27:44.740 --> 27:48.260
So I came to regard all compliments as everyone is beautiful.

27:48.260 --> 27:49.940
Politically correct cuckoldry.

27:49.940 --> 27:54.740
And there would be this thrill of going to TTTT and reading other people saying what

27:54.740 --> 27:57.540
my deepest anxieties told me was really true.

27:57.540 --> 28:00.340
And that was always painful, but there was a kind of

28:00.340 --> 28:01.540
pleasure, too.

28:01.540 --> 28:02.660
There was a rush.

28:02.660 --> 28:03.540
It's exciting.

28:03.540 --> 28:06.820
To burst out of the politically correct bubble and say what you're really thinking.

28:06.820 --> 28:10.340
That personality doesn't matter because big skulled chads get all the girls.

28:10.340 --> 28:14.180
That ContraPoints is a big skulled Hun with a voice like nails on a shockboard.

28:14.180 --> 28:18.500
And at first I justified the habit by telling myself I was just doing research.

28:18.500 --> 28:20.740
I have to keep tabs on what the bigots are saying.

28:20.740 --> 28:22.500
It's simply my job.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.820
But soon I realized it wasn't just research.

28:24.820 --> 28:26.900
And it was infecting me away from the computer.

28:26.900 --> 28:28.980
This ridiculous vocabulary.

28:28.980 --> 28:29.780
Huns.

28:29.780 --> 28:30.820
AGP.

28:30.820 --> 28:33.460
It was popping up in my head at unexpected times.

28:33.460 --> 28:35.860
It was starting to color how I thought about myself.

28:35.860 --> 28:40.020
And worse, it was starting to infect how I thought about other trans women.

28:40.020 --> 28:43.460
And that's the moment I realized, I need to stop looking at this stuff right now or

28:43.460 --> 28:44.980
I'm going to become a monster.

28:44.980 --> 28:47.700
And once that happens, it's going to be very difficult to fix.

28:47.700 --> 28:50.100
This is exactly how the incel black pill works.

28:50.100 --> 28:52.500
There's something infectious about these vocabularies.

28:52.500 --> 28:57.220
Like on days I've been working on this video, I'll go out at night and these words just

28:57.220 --> 28:59.460
involuntarily show up in my thoughts.

28:59.460 --> 29:01.300
That bartender is such a chad.

29:01.300 --> 29:03.380
He's totally hype-mocking that tiny cock.

29:03.380 --> 29:07.300
And the tragic thing is, some incels don't realize what this is doing to their minds

29:07.300 --> 29:08.500
until it's too late.

29:08.500 --> 29:09.380
Let's face it.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.260
Black pills are suey fuel.

29:12.260 --> 29:14.580
And a lot of us can't handle them.

29:14.580 --> 29:19.060
I gleefully indulged in this subreddit the moment I discovered it since I loved uncovering

29:19.060 --> 29:21.940
secrets that society had been hiding from me.

29:21.940 --> 29:27.380
But it has affected my mental health in a bad way.

29:27.940 --> 29:28.500
I made my

29:28.500 --> 29:34.100
first call to the suicide hotline a few weeks ago, and I've never needed to do that before.

29:34.100 --> 29:39.940
I could always talk myself out of it through logic, but my mind is ruined now.

29:40.660 --> 29:44.500
This is a form of what psychologists are calling digital self-harm,

29:44.500 --> 29:48.740
prototypically teens who leave themselves abusive comments from sock puppet accounts.

29:48.740 --> 29:53.380
But the more sophisticated adult version of this involves intentionally seeking out abusive and

29:53.380 --> 29:56.340
disparaging comments about yourself made by other people.

29:56.340 --> 29:58.340
I have a long history of doing this.

29:58.340 --> 30:00.500
Intentionally looking for abusive comments.

30:00.500 --> 30:04.820
Especially ones that cut to the core of my deepest insecurities and fears.

30:04.820 --> 30:05.700
Why?

30:05.700 --> 30:06.900
I don't know.

30:06.900 --> 30:08.660
Why do people cut themselves?

30:08.660 --> 30:12.500
Part of it is what we could call masochistic epistemology.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.260
Whatever hurts is true.

30:14.260 --> 30:16.420
I've recently gotten much better about this.

30:16.420 --> 30:21.220
I haven't been to any of the worse places in a couple months, and my mental health is

30:21.220 --> 30:22.260
much improved.

30:22.260 --> 30:26.500
So incels, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position

30:26.500 --> 30:27.780
worthy of rational debate.

30:27.780 --> 30:28.200
Because these are the same people who have been there for longer than I have done.

30:28.200 --> 30:28.300
So, I'm not going to respond to your worldview like it's an intellectual position worthy of rational debate. Because these are the same people who have been there for longer than I have done.

30:28.300 --> 30:32.580
ideas and arguments, you're not using them the way rational people use arguments. You're

30:32.580 --> 30:36.620
using them as razorblades to abuse yourselves. And I know, because I've done the exact

30:36.620 --> 30:41.980
same thing. The incel worldview is catastrophizing. It's an anxious death spiral. And the solution

30:41.980 --> 30:46.700
to that has to be therapeutic, not logical. A lot of you are lonely. You've been bullied

30:46.700 --> 30:50.780
and neglected. You feel left behind by society. But what you're doing when you're reading

30:50.780 --> 30:56.300
incel forums is you're slowly internalizing a cruel and distorted way of looking at yourselves

30:56.300 --> 31:00.400
and at other people in your situation, and at women, and you're forming mental habits

31:00.400 --> 31:03.800
that are going to make it very difficult for you to live a happy life. So what you have

31:03.800 --> 31:08.820
to do is get off those forums as fast as possible. I'm going to post a link in the description

31:08.820 --> 31:13.800
of this video to instructions on how to block certain websites from your computer, because

31:13.800 --> 31:17.540
for me, that's what it took.

31:17.540 --> 31:21.380
Fifth base. Anal.

31:21.380 --> 31:26.300
So the incel reddit transgender 4chan analogy has a limit, and that limit is that

31:26.300 --> 31:32.460
for a significant subset of the incel community, their primary hatred is not directed at themselves,

31:32.460 --> 31:38.460
but at women. And they really hate women. Like, I'm basically a professional internet bigotry

31:38.460 --> 31:42.540
scholar at this point, I look at this kind of stuff all the time, but researching this video,

31:42.540 --> 31:47.340
I was honestly kinda shocked at the intensity of misogyny on incel forums.

31:47.340 --> 31:50.860
I won't show the worst of it, but we're talking blaming women for rape,

31:50.860 --> 31:55.820
saying they deserve to be raped, calls for state mandated girlfriends and sex slaves, but,

31:56.300 --> 32:00.700
most of all, just a kind of generalized, misinformed rage.

32:00.700 --> 32:04.380
I hate women. I really do.

32:04.380 --> 32:10.540
Every time I look at them, my blood pressure shoots through the roof, when they're gabbing

32:10.540 --> 32:16.700
on the cell phone about Paris Hilton, when they're adjusting their lipstick and taking up my time

32:16.700 --> 32:21.340
rifling through their stupid purse, when they whine to me about their period,

32:21.340 --> 32:26.220
when they blither on and on about some artist, film director, musician, nobody gives a-

32:26.300 --> 32:32.300
flipping fuck about when they cry and expect your personal sympathy but most of all i hate them

32:32.300 --> 32:40.380
because they're smug hyperactive little bitches made that way by our shithole society look what

32:40.380 --> 32:46.060
uncontrolled feminism and the media has hi stacy it's tracy well i was at the mall the other day

32:46.060 --> 32:52.460
with amber heather jenna and trish and we were talking about paris hilton a very relevant

32:52.460 --> 32:57.260
cultural figure in 2018 they live in this cartoon caricature world where it's easy to avoid thinking

32:57.260 --> 33:01.660
of women as fully human and that's where my sympathy runs dry because this kind of hatred

33:01.660 --> 33:06.940
just needs a spark to turn to violence so insults i know you're not gonna listen to anything i say

33:06.940 --> 33:12.140
and you're just gonna say that i'm a tranny and a faggot and a degenerate and to that i say how dare

33:12.140 --> 33:16.620
you say things that are entirely true but also vol sell if you wouldn't and i know you don't

33:16.620 --> 33:21.020
listen to suggestions about how you probably actually could have healthy relationships so

33:21.020 --> 33:22.380
no one can really reach you until

33:22.460 --> 33:26.620
you get out of those forums and allow yourselves to be reached but by way of a closing remark i

33:26.620 --> 33:31.260
guess i simply invite you to consider that you don't even need a warm body or a sex robot to

33:31.260 --> 33:37.500
satisfy the erotic longing you know when i was your age in 1975 every teenage boy had a stratocaster

33:37.500 --> 33:43.500
in his bedroom it was the outlet for his sexual frustration what i'm suggesting is the manosphere

33:43.500 --> 33:48.940
exists because rock and roll is dead but there's other options think about the eroticism of a

33:48.940 --> 33:52.060
rainstorm the clap of thunder

33:53.180 --> 33:59.100
the rustle of the leaves the steam rising off the warm pavement

34:05.660 --> 34:12.460
and whether you're a chad a stacy an incel or a hun you can always return to the caress of

34:12.460 --> 34:22.060
our dark mother the sea whose salty embrace envelops every contour of your naked body

34:22.460 --> 34:48.800
as a

34:48.800 --> 34:49.560
of

34:49.560 --> 34:50.460
my

34:50.460 --> 34:51.260
own

34:51.260 --> 34:52.280
work

34:52.460 --> 35:03.400
Whew, is it hot in here or is it just me?
