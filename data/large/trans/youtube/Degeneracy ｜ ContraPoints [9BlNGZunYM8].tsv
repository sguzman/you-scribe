0	20440	Hello, boys!
20440	24440	I get a lot of people on YouTube calling me degenerate, but I'm still not sure what
24440	25440	that means.
25440	30000	I try to be open to criticism, so I've decided that what I need is a glorious night of wisdom
30000	33880	to set me straight, and I think I've found just the man.
33880	40240	Some call him the valiant champion of Mother Europe, the ever-chosen of the gods, the radiant
40240	42060	paladin of the Fourth Reich.
42060	46240	But to this priestess of blasphemies, he'll always be the golden one.
46240	54240	A young prince, chosen to take the mantle of the ages.
54240	58400	Oh my god.
58400	59400	Look at his butt.
59400	59900	Oh my god.
60000	63800	Daddy, can I have some meat?
63800	66800	Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys.
66800	68280	Oh daddy.
68280	71760	You know, Lars, things have really changed since the last time we talked.
71760	76720	I'm a fair maiden now, to a certain extent, and I've been chaste since I started my transition,
76720	79240	so in a sense, I'm a virgin.
79240	82680	And I don't know about the rest of these decadent sluts, but I, for one, care about
82680	84660	a little thing called purity.
84660	89020	So now that my decade of gender dysphoric, alcohol-drenched debasement seems to be coming
89020	89880	to a close,
89880	92820	I think I'm really ready to begin the training, master.
92820	97480	But first, let us fend off degeneracy by purifying ourselves in a bath of Swedish lake water
97480	99280	in pure absinthe.
99280	100680	It's time.
100680	106680	Till now, I've always got my eye on my own.
106680	111680	I never really cared until I met you.
119880	128500	You know, the only thing I care about is being able to experience the same thing I did.
128500	132580	And I'm glad I can.
132580	135540	But first, let us fend off this…
135540	136540	Uh…
136540	137540	What?
137540	138540	Is this the bad kind of cultural appropriation?
138540	139540	It is, isn't it?
139540	140540	Well mmmmmm.
140540	141540	They're shiny, and I want them.
141540	142540	It's not my fault Black people have good ideas.
142540	143540	What am I supposed to do?
143540	144540	Not steal them?
144540	146880	I'll pop it out.
146880	148680	Alright, thou resplendent champion of the North.
148680	149680	Hit me with the upstart!
149680	157760	with your finest wisdom i'm gonna go train some shoulders and admire myself in the mirror that's
157760	168480	always a nice thing to do well at least we agree on something aha autogynephilic narcissist exposed

293540	293640	so
293920	294920	so so
294920	300520	well i've locked my t i popped my e let's talk about degeneracy what are people talking about
300520	305080	when they call something or someone degenerate well let's take a look at some examples from my
305080	309960	youtube comments section and see if we can figure it out from context transgender communist
309960	315480	degenerate kill yourself you degenerate tranny freak degen tranny lal trannies grow out of their
315480	319320	degeneracy by the time they're senior citizens or at least that's what i would assume since you
319320	323800	never see old dudes in dresses lol what's up with that this is degeneracy you ought to be
323800	331980	slung from a tree everybody likes to rhyme you little homos our future cannon fodder a bunch of physically weak degenerate dogs the end
331980	337700	awww these people are trying so hard to upset me they've only got one card in the deck though alas
337700	348800	anyway what i'm gathering from that sumptuous sampling of the choicest fuck boys is that like a burly nord with his fair maiden the accusation of degeneracy is usually paired with a loathing of queerness
348800	353640	now it's not always just about queerness in fact fascists and social conservatives use the word
353640	359900	Degeneracy as a catch-all term to refer to queers, non-whites, communists, communists,
359900	363640	people with disabilities, basically anyone who gets killed when the fascists win.
363640	367720	But where does the word Degeneracy come from? Let's watch an instructional video to learn
367720	368720	more.
368720	374280	The word Degenerate comes from the Latin prefix
374280	379980	D, which means away from, and the Latin word genus, which means race or kind. So, to be
379980	384320	degenerate is to no longer be of your race or kind, and if you think this already sounds
384320	386820	pretty fashy, you've been paying attention.
386820	391960	The current use of the term degenerate crystallized in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Lamarckian
391960	396540	proto-evolutionary biology, bourgeois disgust toward the urban working class, and a growing
396540	401880	colonialist awareness of supposedly inferior ethnic groups gave rise to Degeneration Theory,
401880	406240	the idea that civilization is in decline due to biological devolution.
406240	409960	Hold on, are these the exact same dingbats responsible for scientific racism?
409960	414960	The exact same dingbats, yes, and one of the chief dingbats was the French aristocrat
414960	419840	Arthur de Gabenot, one of the intellectual grandfathers of Nazism. Gabenot wrote a book
419840	424100	called Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races, in which he developed the idea of the
424100	428560	Aryan master race, warned that miscegenation would lead to social chaos, and gave the word
428560	431360	degenerate its modern fashy definition.
431360	432360	Milord?
432360	438680	The word degenerate, when applied to a people, means that the people no longer has the same
438680	439680	intrinsic value as the people themselves.
439680	439800	Degenerate.
439960	446280	As it had before, because it has no longer the same blood in its veins, continual adulterations
446280	452740	having gradually affected the quality of the blood. In fact, the man of a decadent time,
452740	457900	the degenerate man, properly so called, is a different being from the racial point of
457900	463540	view, from the heroes of the great ages. I think I'm right in concluding that the human
463540	469680	race in all its branches has a secret repulsion from the crossing of blood.
469680	475740	Notice that the degenerate man is the product of a decadent time, and decadence is a concept
475740	482000	closely related to degeneracy. Decadence literally means decay, which, like degeneracy, implies
482000	486920	a fall from a previous state of grace. By the late 19th century, concerns about decadence
486920	489740	were everywhere in the European cultural imagination.
489740	493540	During this period, German nationalist composer Richard Wagner wrote his essay condemning
493540	498360	Jewishness in music, which he first published under the pseudonym Freigedank, which literally
498360	499400	means free thought.
499400	502360	That's right, he pulled the goddamn free speech card.
507460	512260	Then the Jewish doctor Max Nordau published a pseudo-medical book called Degeneration,
512260	516080	accusing Wagner and other contemporary artists of degeneracy. And around the same time, a
516080	519940	bunch of queer, absinthe-swilling artists reclaimed the word decadence as the title
519940	521400	of their movement.
521400	525940	Everyone was accusing everyone of degeneracy and decadence. It was 4chan writ large.
525940	528460	So the idea that Western civilization has become decadent is not exactly true. It's
528460	528480	just a myth.
529400	535540	Not at all. The idea that European civilization is in some way suicidal or self-destructive
535540	540160	goes back to the 18th century, when scholarship about the fall of the Roman Empire led to
540160	544860	speculation about what causes civilizations to decline. And one of the hypotheses was
544860	550220	that effeminate hedonistic emperors and general decadence left the Romans vulnerable to butch
550220	552160	Visigoths and Vandals.
552160	553460	Is there any truth to that?
553460	558460	No. It's vulgar pseudo-history encouraged by social conservatives. The decadent emperors,
558460	564180	Nero, Caligula, Elagabalus, reigned from the 1st to the 3rd centuries. The empire didn't
564180	567480	collapse till the end of the 5th century, which leaves at least 200 years between the
567480	571400	decadence and the collapse, at which time the empire was thoroughly Christian. And in
571400	575860	any case, the eastern half of the empire still survived for another thousand years.
575860	581060	Well, hail Caligula! But you know, a lot of people still believe this story about ancient
581060	586180	civilizations collapsing because of the queers. Here's feminist Camille Poglia on how the
586180	588300	transgenders destroy civilizations.
588460	596960	The movement toward androgyny occurs in late phases of culture, as a civilization is starting
596960	597960	to unravel.
597960	601960	Hang on a second. I'm going to need to shift up a gear for this.
601960	608700	You can find it again and again and again through history in the Greek art. You can
608700	616220	see it happening. All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures of handsome
616220	616580	nude young men athletes that used to be very role playing. And you can see it happening.
616580	617580	And you can see it happening. All of a sudden, there's a kind of, you know, the sculptures
617580	618460	of handsome nude young men athletes that used to be very role playing. And you can see it
618460	619460	happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can
619460	620460	see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And then you
620460	621460	can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And
621460	622460	you can see it happening. And you can see it happening. And you can see it happening.
622460	623460	It's very robust, okay, in the archaic period. It suddenly began to seem like wet noodles
623460	624140	towards the end, okay.
624140	626700	People who live in such times, okay, feel that they're very sophisticated. They're
626700	626960	cosmopolitan.
626960	629060	Domestic divisiveness and yearly
629060	633260	And homosexuality, heterosexuality, so on, anything goes and so on.
633260	639700	But from the perspective of historical distance, you can see it's a culture that no longer
639700	646400	believes in itself. And then what you invariably get are people who are convinced of the power
646400	647100	of heroic blush.
647100	653100	of the power of heroic masculinity, on the edges, whether they're the Vandals or the Huns,
653100	660100	or whether they're the barbarians of ISIS, you see them starting to mass on the upsides of the culture.
660100	666100	And that's what we have right now. There is a tremendous and rather terrifying disconnect
666100	674100	between the infatuation with the transgender movement in our own culture and what's going on out there.
674100	678100	I mean, that's why I'm concerned. I feel it's ominous.
678100	686100	I question whether the transgender choice is indeed genuine in every single case.
688100	693100	Riley J. Dennis. Why did you destroy ancient Rome?
698100	704100	So the idea is that our infatuation with effeminate decadence means we're going to be destroyed by real men.
704100	709100	You know, like ISIS. This doesn't deserve a response. We're moving on.
709100	712100	Where does fuckin' Nietzsche fit into all of this?
712100	715100	Oh god, do we really have to do this?
715100	719100	So there's this dead German asshole named Friedrich N...
719100	722100	who's every edgy 19-year-old's favorite philosopher.
722100	726100	Hey baby, the ladies tell me I'm Apollonian in the streets.
726100	729100	Dionysian in the stree... in the... in the...
729100	731100	Shhhhh. Go to sleep.
731100	734100	Basically what he said is that the moral system of Western Europe,
734100	737100	and modern culture, especially Christianity, is decadent,
737100	740100	in the sense that, unlike pre-Socratic Greek society,
740100	743100	we have all these hangups about guilt and sin and the afterlife.
743100	747100	And Nietzsche says these ideas originate with people who are weak and sick,
747100	752100	and that they repress our basic biological instincts to value strength and beauty and worldly happiness.
752100	756100	In practice, this turns out to be a Rorschach test that everyone reads their own ideas into.
756100	762100	There's a fascist interpretation that says we need to cast off the slave morality idea of universal human equality
762100	764100	to make way for the triumph of beefy Aryans.
764100	768100	And then there's the more progressive interpretation that says we need to stop worrying about, like,
768100	772100	fucking Christian morality, man, and reinstate the cult of Dionysus,
772100	777100	which, okay, I'd be down to go to that party, especially if we don't have to talk about Nietzsche.
782100	788100	What all this is leading up to is simply the point that by the time 20th century fascism was really kicking into gear,
788100	792100	European society was already primed with a couple centuries of degeneracy discourse.
792100	800100	Racist pseudoscience was combined with degeneration theory and Wagnerian mysticism to produce the core ideas of National Socialism.
800100	806100	Namely, one, the German people and nation are like a biological organism that is prone to infection and decay.
806100	813100	Two, Jews, Poles, Roma, homosexuals, communists, and the disabled are degenerate elements that contribute to decay.
813100	819100	And three, the degenerate elements must be purged in order to secure the health and existence of the organism.
819100	820100	So there you have it.
820100	823100	The history of degeneration theory from Foppington to fascism.
823100	825100	Well, thanks for the history lesson, Doc.
825100	832100	One particular thing I've noticed about modern fascists is they're especially obsessed with breeding bountiful crops of white babies.
832100	836100	Nazis call the Jews vermin, but it's the white people they think should breed like rats.
836100	840100	And they specifically loathe anything that stands in the way of fit white reproduction,
840100	848100	including, as they see it, being gay, being trans, being queer, being fat, being a beta male, being a slut,
848100	850100	being a feminist, not getting married,
850100	851100	not having kids,
851100	852100	having kids that aren't white,
852100	853100	masturbating,
853100	854100	looking at porn,
854100	855100	drinking alcohol,
855100	856100	doing drugs,
856100	857100	using birth control,
857100	859100	having abortions.
861100	864100	Condoms and orgies and mass immigration
864100	868100	Malt liquor forties and miscegenation
868100	871100	Boys who use dildos and girls with cock rings
871100	876100	These are my favorite degenerate things
876100	877100	Very cute.
877100	879100	But don't you think they might have a point about the drugs and alcohol?
879100	883100	Oh god damn, fine, we'll talk about the alcohol thing.
886100	890100	There's like ContraPoint's fans now who watch my videos and look up to me,
890100	893100	so I have to be responsible and I hate it.
893100	896100	So look, if you're gonna drink, I'm certainly not gonna stop you,
896100	899100	but don't even think about driving, okay?
899100	902100	Drink lots of water and pace yourself.
902100	904100	There's plenty of time to be blackout when you're dead,
904100	906100	and you're gonna be if you don't take it slow.
906100	908100	Alcohol is dangerous.
908100	910100	It's unhealthy, it's only fun in moderation,
910100	914100	and it can put you in really vulnerable situations with really horrible people.
914100	919100	So I would never recommend that anyone get involved with alcohol for any reason.
921100	924100	I mean, unless you like having fun and feeling good.
924100	926100	Where were we?
928100	931100	Absinthe and coffee and bitchy sarcasm
931100	935100	Estrogen crying and fruitless orgasms
935100	938100	Antifa furries and denby drag kings
938100	943100	These are my favorite degenerate things
950100	952100	Hi there.
952100	959100	I hope you're having a soothing degenerate bath.
960100	967100	What I want you to do is just lie back and try to relax.
968100	974100	And I am just going to slowly start to drip
974100	978100	hot candle wax all over you.
986100	988100	So for fascists and identitarians,
988100	992100	anything that doesn't contribute to the greater cause of white procreation is degenerate.
992100	995100	And individual fascists differ on what those things are.
995100	997100	Most of them agree that homosexuality is degenerate,
997100	1000100	because apparently gay people can't raise children.
1000100	1005100	Fascists venerate nuclear families of one dominant white man and one subservient white woman
1005100	1010100	because they view the situation as the perfect factory for churning out clean-cut heterosexual white kids.
1010100	1014100	And if you soften the emphasis on whiteness, you get basic social conservatism.
1014100	1017100	So this really isn't just about fascism,
1017100	1021100	though I do like to talk about the fascists because they have the biggest muscles.
1021100	1025100	Speaking of which, a lot of rightists have realized that in the 21st century,
1025100	1028100	the social conservative position is not very cool.
1028100	1032100	So what they do is they say they of course have no problem with individual homosexuals,
1032100	1035100	what they have a problem with is the gay agenda.
1035100	1038100	What they have a problem with, essentially, is queerness.
1038100	1040100	Now, what is queerness?
1040100	1043100	Well, people have all kinds of scholastic debates about this,
1043100	1047100	but in its most generic sense, queer means that you have some kind of weird sex thing.
1047100	1051100	So either your gender is all fucked up, or you have creative tastes and sexual partners.
1051100	1054100	But unlike the words homosexual or transgender,
1054100	1057100	queer is tinged with a connotation of rebellion,
1057100	1063100	often rebellion against the heteronormative commandments of marriage, monogamy, procreation, and productivity.
1063100	1068100	So social conservatives and even a few fascists claim that they're willing to tolerate gay and transgender people,
1068100	1074100	but only if you shut up about it, conform to straight society, and try to act as normal as possible.
1074100	1078100	What they can't stand is loud nonconformist queerness, because think of the children.
1078100	1083100	We're talking pride parades, activists, leather daddies, gender fucks,
1083100	1086100	gangsters, polyamorists, sing it with me,
1086100	1090100	these are my favorite degenerate things.
1090100	1096100	To fascists, the pursuit of individual happiness must be subservient to the health and success of the race.
1096100	1101100	So in a sense, traditionalism is a much more collectivistic philosophy than even communism,
1101100	1104100	which only demands the communal ownership of the means of production.
1104100	1109100	At least in theory, communism doesn't tell you what gender to be or who and how to fuck.
1109100	1112100	In practice, though, there's not a single position on the political spectrum
1112100	1114100	that's immune to complaining about degeneracy.
1114100	1117100	While I was researching this video, I randomly came across an article
1117100	1121100	from an American communist newspaper from 1976 that claims,
1121100	1125100	While we communists suppose attacks on anyone by the bourgeoisie, including homosexuals,
1125100	1128100	we do not uphold homosexuality as a democratic right.
1128100	1133100	Homosexuality is a form of social sickness, a form of social perversion.
1133100	1138100	It is a form of bourgeois ideology, which appeals especially to the petty bourgeoisie
1138100	1141100	because of its appearance as sexual freedom.
1141100	1145100	Homosexuality arose from class oppression and the oppression of women.
1145100	1149100	Geez, fellow degenerates, we're kinda short on allies out here, huh?
1149100	1152100	We've got the fascists calling us sexual Bolshevists,
1152100	1155100	and meanwhile the communists are calling us bourgeois decadents.
1155100	1157100	Why does everyone hate decadence so much?
1157100	1160100	Is pleasure really so wrong?
1171100	1189100	Listen, I don't want my position to be misunderstood.
1189100	1194100	I know that most people will probably always be straight, cis, monogamous, and procreative.
1194100	1196100	And you know, that's probably for the best.
1196100	1199100	Someone needs to have the babies and keep society running.
1199100	1201100	All we gentle decadents ask is,
1201100	1204100	to be allowed to enjoy our special delights and peace.
1204100	1207100	My goal is not to purge masculinity from society or anything of the kind.
1207100	1211100	In the perfect society created by me, there will be plenty of beefy studs around,
1211100	1212100	so don't you worry about that.
1212100	1215100	And that's the difference between me and the fascists.
1215100	1218100	I want a society where people like me are simply allowed to exist.
1218100	1222100	And, this is the important part, where people not like me are simply allowed to exist.
1222100	1226100	Fascists want a society where only people like them are allowed to exist.
1226100	1228100	The queer quest is to survive.
1228100	1230100	The fascist quest is to be the only survivor.
1231100	1234100	Society can tolerate for thousands of years the existence of priests,
1234100	1237100	which is to say, bejeweled men in dresses who have no children
1237100	1239100	and are a giant tax-exempt drain on the economy.
1239100	1243100	Well, you can certainly tolerate queer people who crack Nazi codes
1243100	1245100	and write you musicals and sing you songs.
1245100	1249100	So if you think the meaning of life is to create as many white babies as possible,
1249100	1252100	you know what? Fine. Go make white babies.
1252100	1255100	But I really must insist upon my right, and the right of all degenerates,
1255100	1258100	to coexist alongside you in our own decadent communities
1258100	1260100	of race mixing, sexual anarchy, and rock and roll.
1261100	1265100	Rock and roll.
1265100	1270100	Rock on gold dust woman
1270100	1273100	Take your silver spoon
1273100	1276100	Take your grave
1280100	1284100	Wake up in the morning
1284100	1289100	See your sunrise loves to go down
1291100	1299100	Lousy lovers pick their prey
1299100	1304100	But they never cry out loud
1304100	1308100	Cry out
1308100	1310100	Well, did she make you cry?
1310100	1312100	Make you break down?
1312100	1314100	Shatter your illusions of love?
1314100	1317100	Tell me, is it over now?
1317100	1320100	Do you know how to pick up the pieces and go?
1320100	1328100	Oh, yeah.
1328100	1331100	Rock on ancient queen
1331100	1339100	Follow those who fell in your shadow
1339100	1341100	That was dagged up.
1341100	1345100	Rulers make bad lovers
1345100	1348100	You better put your kingdom up for sale.
1348100	1352100	One more time.
1352100	1355100	Oh, did she make you cry?
1355100	1357100	Make you break down?
1357100	1359100	Shatter your illusions of love?
1359100	1362100	Well, tell me, is it over now?
1362100	1365100	Do you know how
1365100	1369100	To pick up the pieces and go?
1369100	1376100	Rock and roll.
1378100	1381100	Rock on gold dust woman
1381100	1382980	Take your silver spoon
1382980	1384100	Take your silver spoon
1384100	1385540	Pick up your grave
