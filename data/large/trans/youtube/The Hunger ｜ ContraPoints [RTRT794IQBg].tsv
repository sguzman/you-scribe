59620	67540	you say it only matters that you say we don't discriminate here between what is true or false

73380	81140	the important thing is that you never stop talking because that's what freedom is all about

124080	147500	400 referring to what you do if not giving it your best version but let's Сам
147500	147580	im
147580	147620	the studio
147620	147820	do we share so no reaction
147820	148260	remember when you jak is~!
148260	148660	is you know we're like when you watchdeep listening right now we will leaving the is sometimes
148660	148900	através of the lost holy water times like ought to stop producing gambling right now angels listen no fear
148900	154280	Anarchy? What does that even mean? Jackie, the enemy has taken control of our culture.
154760	160320	The radical left and the corporate media, they're replacing the nuclear family with aimless
160320	166200	fornication. They're tearing apart the social fabric and normal Americans are being silenced.
166720	174080	That's why we're seeing all this woke, cancel culture, PC, CRT, SJW, globo, homo, pomo, nomo.
174080	178960	The people pushing this agenda, they don't want us resisting our captivity in Babylon.
179420	184500	And that's why we're seeing so many attacks today on the most persecuted minority in America,
185220	192200	the Christian majority. Virginia, I appreciate your pious gibberish, but could you be a little
192200	198300	more specific? Of course, Jackie. Religious liberties are under attack. We're losing our
198300	203820	right to teach biblical morality to children who are growing up in public schools run by
203820	204060	socialists. We're losing our right to teach biblical morality to children who are growing up
204060	209900	social engineers who laugh at God and would rather have gender neutral bathrooms and drag
209900	215740	queen story hour than teach young people about the wonder working power of the precious blood
215740	221440	of the lamb. Yes, we do still have a constitution in this country. I'm sorry that you feel offended
221440	226620	by it. Believe it or not, the founding fathers actually wanted to protect us from whatever
226620	231680	twisted necromancy these people think is Christianity. Jackie, these communists are
231680	233680	polluting the innocence of children.
234060	239500	And if you speak out against the grooming, they call you a bigot. Parents get no say anymore.
239840	245900	They're being vilified just for having legitimate concerns about the deviant lifestyles promoted in
245900	250840	schools. You know, one day your kids will come home and you won't even recognize them anymore.
251240	256960	That's the real agenda here. Sexual indoctrination. This generation that's coming up,
256960	263800	20% identify as LGBT, 40% are attempting suicide, and the remaining
263800	271820	70% are being delivered directly into the hands of pornographers, satanic cultists, or worse,
272460	278540	Episcopalians. No. No, I won't stand for that. I'm sorry, what does this have to do with drugs?
278740	285360	Well, everything. Addiction and sexual brokenness. These are two heads of the same serpent,
285360	292540	symptoms of the same cultural leprosy. Single mothers, weak, emasculated fathers,
292680	293680	childhood.
293800	299420	Is anyone going to ask me what I think? Why was I invited onto this podcast to sit here and listen
299420	305620	to the ramblings of a bigoted hate preacher? Well, God has nothing to do with hate. Christ is the
305620	310660	definition of love. Well, I'm not talking about Christ, Virginia. I'm talking about you. Justine,
310660	317500	if she doesn't hate anyone, then how can she be a bigot? You liberals call everyone who disagrees
317500	323540	with you a bigot. Exactly. Why can't you just leave your emotions out of it for once and have a calm,
323800	328260	rational conversation with people who have different opinions?
328260	334780	Okay, well, let's see how that goes. Jackie, regular Americans like me are just trying to
334780	341160	set people free from sexual brokenness and protect the rights of children. Kids who are struggling
341160	346660	with gender confusion should have the right to access reparative therapy that will make them
346660	353580	whole again. Reparative therapy? You mean handing gay children over to exorcists for years of torture?
353800	360160	What a terrible wound of self-disgust to inflict on young people, telling them they're broken and
360160	364980	polluted and they need God to make them whole. You people are selling the cure to a sickness
364980	371940	you created. Are you cancel-culturing me right now? Oh my god, she's totally cancel-culturing
371940	378140	you right now. Are you thought-policing me? No, I'm trying to stop you from thought-policing
378140	382280	everyone else. You're saying it should be a thought crime? You're saying that I am a thought
382280	383780	criminal? Justine, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
383780	387860	because I happen to believe in the traditional biblical definition of marriage
387860	389940	between a man and a woman who form a covenant before God
389940	392340	who gave his only begotten son to wash away the sins of the world
392340	394180	when he died on the cross and was resurrected three days later,
394240	395200	all glory to his name.
396400	399000	Jackie, these are the silencing tactics of the radical left.
399380	402300	And I'm sure the blue check Twitter mob is already coming for me
402300	403680	because you can't say anything anymore.
403680	408040	And Christians like me, our voices are being silenced.
409080	410640	You know who's really being silenced?
411840	413600	People who are silent.
414540	417480	Being silent is a big part of being silenced.
417800	419540	That's what being silenced means.
420140	421840	So who's really being silenced?
422280	423880	Not people on podcasts.
424440	428560	Not rich morons screaming into the biggest megaphone in world history
428560	430080	about how silenced they are.
430080	435420	No, the people who are silenced are people we never hear from.
436040	438860	Because, and I really can't emphasize this enough,
439440	441100	they are silenced.
441680	442720	People in prison.
442720	445160	Queer teenagers in conservative towns.
445480	448620	The actual downtrodden and oppressed people of this country.
448940	450620	Not you, Miss America.
451320	453220	Not you, Mother Superior.
453800	454800	You're not silenced.
455340	457840	You just know that what you're saying is indefensible.
458380	460880	So you defend your right to say it.
461260	463840	Okay, but if I'm not being silenced,
464220	466800	then why can't I say the N-word?
467060	468900	Why do you want to say the N-word?
468900	471880	So I only have freedom of speech
471880	472680	when I can,
472880	476040	which conforms to your liberal ideology?
476600	478200	God, damn it, Jackson.
478200	479520	Um...
479520	482820	That sounds a little bit like...
482840	484880	Bein' silenced?
485480	487040	She's stonewalling me.
487040	488480	All over America today,
488480	491240	white parents are having to sit their children down
491240	495640	and explain that there's certain words they just can't say
495960	497740	because of the color of their skin.
498600	501600	Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.
501600	502680	would be turned down.
502720	504120	turning in his grave.
504120	504960	Would he?
504960	506740	I mean, he's definitely turning in his grave,
506740	508100	but not for the reasons you think.
508100	510200	Jackie, can I bring this back on topic
510200	512000	and share the good news of the gospel?
512000	513040	That's not the topic.
513040	515380	I have prayed on this, and honestly,
515380	518700	the Holy Spirit has filled me with so much compassion
518700	522040	for young people struggling with same-sex temptation.
522040	524880	You know, when I look out at all these angry people
524880	529120	at the pride parade, doing all this sexual acting out
529120	531200	and wearing provocative clothing
531200	533640	in a desperate bid for attention,
533640	535840	I see the broken childhoods,
535840	538880	and I see the craving for acceptance and belonging,
538880	540300	and I feel for them.
540300	541140	I really do.
541140	544620	Wow, you're such a good person for taking pity
544620	546760	on the poor, sad homos.
546760	548760	You know, what you people really love
548760	551740	is the aesthetic of being compassionate,
551740	553900	but all you're really doing is calling into question
553900	556040	the worthiness of other people's lives.
556040	559500	Yeah, Virginia, why can't you just live and let live,
559500	560660	you know?
560660	562720	Whatever happened to love your neighbor?
562720	565620	Jackie, anyone who knows me will tell you
565620	569100	that I'm the most compassionate person that they know,
569100	573080	but love your neighbor doesn't mean anything goes.
573080	576380	And it certainly doesn't mean that we all just bow down
576380	580480	to the intimidation tactics of the secular ruling elite.
580480	583260	It doesn't mean that we can't ask questions
583260	586060	about this narrative we're all being force-fed
586060	588260	that God and scripture have no place
588260	590060	in American life anymore,
590060	596060	that we're all supposed to submit to the takeover of these Marxist plutocrats imposing their
596060	601380	queer ideology which says that if your child comes home from school and announces she's
601380	606820	a different gender this week, then you have no choice but to surrender her to the surgeon's
606820	607820	knife.
607820	613440	Slicing up tiny little children's bodies, that's where this is headed.
613440	615120	The shrine of Moloch.
615120	620040	Oh my god, no one is slicing up children's bodies, what are you talking about?
620040	621540	You absolute lunatic.
621540	627480	Well, speaking of the transgenders, in the interest of full disclosure, I feel I should
627480	633800	let our listeners know that one of our guests this week used to be a man.
633800	637600	Isn't that right, Justine Tableau?
637600	640960	Or should I say, Justin?
640960	643600	Oh come on, really?
643600	646960	Alright, we're doing this.
650040	663100	Are you smoking a cigarette in the studio?
663100	665040	Is this a throwback to the 1970s?
665040	669600	No, it's a throw forward to the 20 I don't give a fucks.
669600	675100	Well, don't mind if I do.
675100	679280	Nothing wrong with the proud history of good American tobacco.
679280	680040	Good Virginia tobacco.
680040	681040	Jackie.

689720	692840	Excuse me, Jackie, I'm really not comfortable with this.
692840	699380	I was not warned that there would be a transgender here today, and I really have nothing to say
699380	702440	to this eunuch servant of Jezebel.
702440	707480	Well, I wasn't planning to spend my day seated across from a goddamn exorcist, but here we
707480	708480	are.
708480	709480	Virginia.
709480	711040	Are you prepared to get splashed?
711040	717160	Then you can get out of the free speech zone, because you're about to get wet.
717160	718660	Excuse me?
718660	722660	I agreed to this podcast because I thought you were a conservative.
722660	724440	I'm a libertarian.
724440	726360	Anything goes baby USA.
726360	733160	Jackie, the problem with libertarians is that a society with no values cannot function.
733160	737960	Christians tried to warn you that if you changed the definition of marriage, it would be a
737960	738960	free for all.
738960	741200	And now, here we are.
741200	744580	96.5 genders are being taught in American classrooms.
744580	747960	It seems we've forgotten that God created Adam and Eve.
747960	755340	Not Adam and Eve, and Kai and Jaden, and Caden and Lilith and Ashton and Schuyler and Rainbow.
755340	758480	Homosexuality is a gateway drug to transgenderism.
758480	764040	And from there, it's just one step away to pedophilia and bestiality.
764040	765760	And that's the real agenda here.
765760	767960	These people want to lower the age of consent.
767960	768960	And legally.
768960	773560	They have socialized sodomy with all the beasts that walk the Earth and the birds
773560	776220	of the sea and all the fishes of the sky.
776220	777220	All of them?
777220	787980	What do Ready Slide and Random
787980	789520	Uh-huh.
789520	792740	You know what I thought?
792740	793860	Just...
793860	795340	Prejudice.
795340	796400	Still?
796400	797400	None?
797400	798400	None?
798400	803480	super provocative super brave and super bold we're living in Orwell's nightmare but you're
803480	808760	a freedom fighter and you refuse to be silenced amazing look I just think it's great that three
808760	814380	people with differing opinions can all sit down in a room and have a respectful conversation
814380	820540	well cheers to us is it great you know I don't think it's that great and I don't think there's
820540	825720	anything respectful about the two of you sitting here interrogating the morality of queer people
825720	832660	something you know absolutely nothing about oh I know more than you might think I used to be
832660	842220	a homosexual you what no I'm not doing this today I'm sorry you used to be a homosexual that's right
842220	848380	Jackie before I was saved here we go I used to be a lesbian that's who I thought I was I lived
848380	855460	that lifestyle you used to be a lesbian okay name five things you love about men this should be
855460	855700	good
855700	860440	gather around everyone let's all witness the power of Christ I'm sure this will be very convincing
860440	868140	I love the Lord who does not command me to be straight he commands me to be holy fear not
868140	876240	you will no longer live in shame for your creator will be your husband okay well if you want to be
876240	881320	the bride of Christ then by all means but you know keep it in the bedroom I'm tired of you
881320	885440	people shoving your lifestyle in everyone's face Virginia I'm confused I thought people
885440	893000	are just born that way like Jesus can't change that Jackie the mainstream media establishment
893000	898780	doesn't want you to know that people like me exist because that goes against their narrative
898780	905980	but recovered homosexuals should be allowed to tell our stories the ploy of the enemy is to make
905980	913440	us feel that we cannot change but what if every addict said well I'm just a junkie that's who I am
913440	915180	I sexually identify as a homosexual I'm just a junkie that's who I am I sexually identify as a
915180	924980	alcoholic so Jesus can't change me well that's a good point uh no it isn't gay is just a feeling
924980	933320	homosexual lust same-sex temptation that's a feeling not an identity like maybe you struggle
933320	938880	with wrath but you don't identify as wrathful maybe sometimes you want to punch a guy in the
938880	945020	face I want to punch you in the face and yet you haven't punched me lo and behold you have a
945180	952560	desire without acting on the desire when I was saved I left behind the false identity I used to
952560	958320	walk in and I was delivered by Christ's transformative love my old self has been
958320	965280	crucified with Christ it is no longer I who lives but Christ lives in me but before I made God Lord
965280	974160	of my desires I was controlled by sin by drugs by alcohol by homosexuality so you used to be cool
975180	982560	wow behold the power of Christ you think it's cool to be contaminated in fornication yes I do
982560	988920	it's pretty cool I'm sure we're all a little contaminated in fornication is this a joke
988920	997940	to you do you find this humorous yeah I don't because I have glimpsed the gates of hell
997940	1004380	where unrepentant souls endure the horrors of sin away from God shut out from grace
1005180	1008360	tormented by unyielding guilt and shame
1012140	1019340	yes we've all been to Cincinnati can we wrap this back around to the drug topic Virginia
1019340	1025340	you're saying you used to be an addict that's right Jackie what were you addicted to Miracle
1025340	1034280	Whip veggie tales uh communion wafers maybe no I was addicted to alcohol to pornography
1035180	1045500	to lusting after women and to hype hype you Virginia lamb were a hype addict look Virginia
1045500	1053000	can you drop a quick story time on this because I am intrigued Jackie I would love to testify you
1053000	1060260	know growing up I never really felt connected to my mother girl not this when I left home I was lost
1060260	1064880	I was a wretch I was on fire and I rebuked that fire
1065180	1073700	I used foul language I went out clubbing I cut my hair off I gained weight I was tempted by same
1073700	1078980	sex attraction and I struggled with gender confusion you know I was always a little more
1078980	1084980	masculine I'd even started down the path toward transgendered I used to shoot up testosterone
1084980	1089600	that's why my voice is a little lower yeah the two of you sound kind of the same honestly if
1089600	1094700	I didn't know I don't think I could tell which one of you is the man neither of us is the man
1095180	1101720	Lynn though if anything this one's the man she he's the one injecting testosterone God has healed
1101720	1110480	the feminine within me all along God was tugging at my heart but for me the road to heaven led
1110480	1119360	through hell I felt a terrible void inside I lived in the flesh I lived in sin with another
1119360	1124940	woman hoping to satisfy that hunger here we go when I gazed upon her beauty I thought
1125180	1132380	sunlight had broken through the clouds but the light I saw was nothing but the fire of my own
1132380	1143300	wickedness I knew that lifestyle was wrong but I couldn't quit until she broke my heart and then
1144860	1149600	I was cast into the outer darkness yeah she probably got tired of your
1149600	1152540	Jesus it was like a part of me was ripped away
1153560	1155000	and I was left to face
1155000	1161560	brokenness alone what was she a capricorn no a sagittarius well there's your problem
1162280	1169320	next time maybe try a water sign stop interrupting i'm living for the drama jackie i was alone
1169960	1179240	i was suicidal i was an addict i was lost until one day i decided to go to church with my mom
1180200	1189080	and i was surrounded by these women singing what can wash away my sin what can make me whole again
1189880	1200200	nothing but the blood of jesus that washes white as snow and i felt this tingling all over my body
1200200	1207800	and i knew i was hearing the voice of god for the very first time not just the words of the hymn
1207800	1209160	but the voice of the father
1209800	1215640	speaking directly to me yes we all like music and suddenly my pain made sense
1216440	1223160	i don't have to live this way anymore in that moment i was transfigured by the holy spirit
1223160	1230520	i was cleansed i was healed i was delivered i was sanctified i was redeemed my guilty
1230520	1238840	stains were washed away and i exchanged my brokenness and pain for his loving grace okay so
1239960	1248040	i'm confused do you eat dick now what's your deal jackie my deal is that i entered the throne room
1248040	1254120	with a repentant heart and rebuked the enemy that keeps me from the father when i found jesus
1254120	1262040	i found someone who truly loves me and through obedience to him my identity is no longer in my
1262040	1269000	attractions but in christ you know what i think virginia i think that you are immoderate in love
1269000	1274760	and a moderate with substances and so you need an imaginary father figure to make all the rules
1274760	1280200	because you can't control yourself but your weakness doesn't mean that everyone else should
1280200	1287080	have to live in a state of enforced mental infancy mental infancy bondage to the flesh
1287080	1298520	is mental infancy i know justin the chains of sin i know the murmuring complaints of the flesh the itch the ache the shame and ill秒
1299000	1306060	I lived in mud. I lived in filth. I know the thorns, the seething cauldron, the great whirlwind
1306060	1312760	that whips sinners round an endless wheel of pain. But my shame was hammered to the cross
1312760	1318340	for those who belong to Christ have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
1320000	1328420	Virginia, who are you trying to impress with this ostentatious sexual anorexia? Who is the
1328420	1334120	beneficiary of your erotic constipation? God? I really don't think he cares, Gorge.
1334800	1340940	Celibacy is not a good deed. To me, this all just sounds like a lot of words to say that you're gay
1340940	1345660	and you hate yourself. I don't think I could have put it less succinctly myself.
1345960	1352620	Is it hate to worship the glory of God over the glory of self? Where's my nail? Is it hate to be
1352620	1357740	anchored to the Savior's will that leads me from temptation? Damn it. To walk with purpose,
1358100	1358400	abide by God's will? Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it.
1358400	1365260	Abiding in the identity of who God made me? Is it hate to heal the brokenness and be made whole
1365260	1370920	through radical obedience to the Holy Spirit? Have you been made whole, Virginia? Because to me,
1371020	1376420	it sounds like you amputate half of your own soul and you call it sin and shame. Well,
1376920	1383100	that's my definition of sexual brokenness. Why am I being lectured about amputation by a castrato?
1383320	1387760	She's hilarious. She's a wit. We are all half angel and half beast.
1387760	1394760	The flesh must die so the spirit may live. The soul, by definition, is not the flesh.
1395060	1401920	Have you really wandered so far astray? Have you feasted with such profligacy on apples of
1401920	1407920	Sodom that you think the urge to fornicate is half the soul? No, Virginia, that's not what I think.
1408420	1414420	What I think is that you have a vulgar, cracker-barrel understanding of human sexuality
1414420	1417420	and you're on a save-the-children type moral crusade.
1417760	1422920	Because you lack the adult capacity to face the demons in your own head.
1422920	1429480	You talk about the flesh and same-sex temptation. Well, what even is that, Virginia?
1430240	1436720	I want specifics. What is this terrible thing you're so afraid you're gonna do if Jesus stops
1436720	1442900	holding your hand for 10 minutes? What? You think you're gonna rail a line of hype off a stripper's
1442900	1447740	tits? Excuse me? Answer this. What do you think erotic love is a design?
1447760	1459740	For? Wait, I know this one. Sex. No, that's too easy. Erotic love is not aimless pleasure-seeking.
1460420	1469060	It's a longing for connection, for recognition, for wholeness, to traverse the lonely void that
1469060	1477280	separates us from each other, to liberate repressed energy, to feel alive. Love is not the flesh.
1477760	1483880	It's not temptation. It's nothing like the urge to punch someone in the face. It's nothing like
1483880	1492640	being an alcoholic. It's not a craving. It's a yearning. The desire for reunion with our other
1492640	1500860	half, Aristophanes. But you people don't understand that. Because you are vulgarians. You
1500860	1506020	have no sense of humanity. And you have no sense of the erotic. Well, that sounds like a bunch of
1506020	1506500	liberal,
1506500	1507200	liberal,
1507200	1507700	liberal,
1507700	1508840	sexist bullcrap.
1508840	1516460	Jackie, your brain is so small. It's just so tiny. Look at me.
1517180	1521320	You're a dum-dum. Okay? And I'm gonna need you to stop talking.
1521320	1527180	As usual, the cancel culture woke stoppo is trying to silence me.
1527180	1533800	Shh, Jackie. I really am trying to silence you this time. Because you're so stupid. And I can't
1533800	1535660	stand it anymore. So shut up.
1535660	1537140	I'm giving you the bullshit.
1537140	1544900	giving you the plague liberal okay well i hope it kills me because i'm done see i'll never get sick
1544900	1551300	because every day i drink a pint of antifungal hedgehog medication doctors don't want you to
1551300	1557300	know about it i could not possibly be more done you may be done but i'm not well you people never
1557300	1564100	are are you you want to talk about yearning i mean i get it i used to live in shame i know the
1564100	1569620	insatiable longing to be with another woman yes we've all noticed let me tell you it is not
1569620	1577940	freedom it is bondage you do not possess the flesh justin tableau the flesh possesses you rebuke it
1578500	1586260	and be free or perish as a slave for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life
1586260	1593220	and christ jesus our lord you people do love to rebuke things don't you justin the love you yearn
1593220	1594060	for can only be found in the sacrifice reward of your own blood jesus our lord you people do love to rebuke things don't you justin the love you yearn for can only
1594060	1602360	be found in Jesus. Only he can fill the void. I know. I used to be like you, Justin. I was lost.
1602600	1609280	I was blind. I was confused in my identity. I used to reject the gospel until my sin took
1609280	1615280	everything from me and I needed a savior. And then I called out to God for salvation
1615280	1623400	and he came to me as a loving father. It's not too late for you, Justin. You are so loved.
1624060	1631200	God loves you. But this? This is not God's intent for you. It is ridiculous to me that
1631200	1636220	you think you know God's intent. The height of cosmological narcissism. I'm sorry,
1636220	1641900	has Reddit gone offline? Have we run out of fedoras in America? I'm just trying to
1641900	1645940	understand why you hate God. I'm just trying to understand why you hate love.
1646300	1654020	God is love. Is he? The only love worth having. What you call love. The sin I used to live in.
1654060	1660860	The world, the flesh, and the devil. That only ever brought me pain. Yes, because heartbreak is
1660860	1669840	painful. Love is painful. The poets are unanimous. Love is bittersweet, says Sappho. Eros, giver of
1669840	1675960	pain. What's Sappho? A pagan pornographer. The sort of filth these people want to teach to
1675960	1681700	children. Well, if the Aeolian lyric poets can't tell us what love is, then goddammit,
1681900	1683620	I don't know who can.
1684500	1691740	God for one. God has a sexual plan for all of us. That's hot. God's plan is for male and female to
1691740	1698060	be one flesh. Men's and women's bodies fit together for the purpose of creating children.
1698180	1703700	You do realize you don't need a man to have a baby, right? Seminal fluids are not difficult
1703700	1710060	to come by, even in this economy. You have a guy? A semen guy? That's just most guys.
1710220	1714040	Look, I do need to brush up on my apologetics, but-
1714040	1719960	Since I'm among heathens, clearly, I will do my best to argue not from faith,
1720520	1727700	but from reason. I love reason. Do you? Tell me this, Justin, which is better? A love that is
1727700	1734160	eternal, or a love that can be ripped away at any moment? I'm sorry your girlfriend left you,
1734260	1738200	that must have been really hard. Just answer the question. Nothing is eternal, Virginia.
1738720	1743100	Except maybe sanctimonious assholes. Isn't a love that is eternal,
1744040	1750760	superior to a love that is fleeting? Yes, Socrates, it is certain. And don't you yearn?
1750960	1757700	Not just for a love in the moment, but for a love that lasts eternity? Yes, Socrates,
1757920	1768560	that is evident. And isn't eternal love what we call God? Yes, Virginia, we all want to be loved,
1768560	1771480	but sometimes we don't get what we want.
1772480	1774000	So you have-
1774040	1776100	I have no argument.
1776200	1777160	Do I really need an argument?
1777660	1782500	This is just a semantic trick. You're saying that God is eternal love, and then
1782500	1787060	magically that must exist because you defined it that way?
1787160	1792360	So you don't have an argument? I'm sorry.
1792500	1792980	Interesting.
1793140	1797480	I didn't prepare to have a debate about neoplatonism with a five-alarm lesbo
1797480	1803720	cosplaying as a trad wife. I'm supposed to take this seriously? Why? Why am I even here? What am
1803720	1809680	I doing? Why am I talking to these people? I think you're here because God led you here, Justin.
1810040	1816180	I don't think God leads people to podcasts. Clearly, this transgender identity of yours
1816180	1823440	is a defense against the emptiness you feel inside. There's a hunger in your soul. No pleasure
1823440	1831380	of the flesh can satisfy. Do you not feel the thirst in your body like a parched land? Well,
1831940	1833660	yeah, I feel the thirst.
1833720	1835400	I'm sure we all feel the thirst.
1835480	1837160	If I may quote Psalm 63.
1837400	1838040	Please don't.
1838120	1846400	You, God, are my God. Earnestly, I seek you. I thirst for you. My whole being longs for you
1846400	1853800	in a dry and parched land where there is no water. Because your love is better than life.
1854380	1862720	My lips will glorify you. I will praise you as long as I live. And in your name, I will raise up
1862720	1863680	my hands.
1864160	1872760	I will be fully satisfied as in the richest of foods. With singing lips, my mouth will praise you.
1874200	1880800	Virginia, go to therapy, says the delusional man who thinks he's a woman. You're the one who needs
1880800	1886660	to go to therapy. No, you go to therapy. I'll pray for you. I'll pray for you. I will pray
1886660	1893120	straight to Satan. Look, can't we just agree that we are all a little Looney Tunes? You have your
1893120	1901000	Jesus bullshit. You have your gender nonsense. And I, well, I'm sure I must have something.
1901460	1908620	The free market. Right. We all have our little delusions. The important thing is that we cling
1908620	1914900	to them. And we never let go, no matter how much evidence gets in the way. Because that's what
1914900	1922520	makes us free. And freedom is what makes America great. Other countries, they don't have choices.
1923400	1930740	But in America, we have the freedom to choose whatever we want. So can we do drugs? No,
1931020	1935580	that's illegal. I thought you said we could choose. Yes, but we have to make the right
1935580	1941260	choices. And what if we want to make the wrong choices? Well, the boot of the law will crush
1941260	1947120	you without mercy. You will be locked in a tiny cage. That is literally the opposite of freedom.
1947320	1952820	Well, we have to be tough on crime. It's the only way to keep this country free. We have to build,
1952920	1953100	rina.
1953120	1960000	more prisons. Who decides what the right and wrong choices are? Well, father decides. Father
1960000	1966400	always decides. And do you always do what father says? Of course, we always do what father says.
1967320	1973920	Why? Because father says so. Why can't you just admit that you hate God because you want to sleep
1973920	1978800	with men? Oh, I don't want to sleep with men. Yes, you do. You're a man who struggles with gender
1978800	1985380	confusion and same-sex temptation. No, I'm not. I'm a lesbian, just like you, girl. My heart was
1985380	1993100	also broken by a woman. I thought she was a cat girl. She turned out to be a fuck boy. You are a
1993100	2000740	straight man. I mean, at this point, I wish. But no, definitely a gay woman. We're all stuck with it.
2000740	2008380	Hold on. So you're attracted to women, but you became a woman. Does that mean you're attracted
2008380	2008780	to your...
2008800	2009940	Self? No.
2010200	2011220	In the mirror?
2011620	2016420	No, because I'm not a fucking animal that can't tell the difference between my own reflection
2016420	2022720	and a different person. Desire is always for something that you lack. You can't desire
2022720	2030680	yourself because you're already one with yourself. Desire feeds on absence. It reaches out across
2030680	2035960	a void. I don't know. I think if I was a lesbian, I'd fuck me.
2035960	2038660	Okay. Well, thank you for sharing.
2038800	2046380	Aren't a lot of serial killers transgender? Do you have bodies in your basement? You better watch
2046380	2051620	out or you're gonna be next. Are those clothes even yours? Or are you wearing the clothes of
2051620	2058540	your victims? Jackie, I will drizzle a red wine reduction over your liver, and I will feast upon
2058540	2065460	it. Jackie, these transsexuals, they're the greediest of all perverts. It's not enough for
2065460	2068660	you to possess a woman. You also have to appropriate female...
2068660	2073580	...female beauty for yourself. Who said anything about female beauty, Virginia? You're the
2073580	2077120	one who keeps bringing that up. Nice. Got her!
2077120	2081980	Shut up, dum-dum. I said it to hurt her, not to entertain you. You stay out of this.
2081980	2088120	Look, so you're a straight man. You could've had a wife. You could've raised a family.
2088120	2092820	Your life could've meant something. But you threw it all away? You really think having
2092820	2098440	babies is the only way to have a meaningful life? Do you have babies? Well, priests don't
2098440	2104100	have babies. Maybe think of queer people as priests. Except, you know, the people we
2104100	2109520	have sex with are adults. Whoa! Okay. That's Catholics. That's not Christians. It's kind
2109520	2115080	of crossing a line, don't you think? Oh, has free speech gone too far? Now it's gone too
2115080	2121140	far? Can we have a civil conversation, please? Is it impossible to have a civil conversation
2121140	2126400	in America today? Well, that ship has sailed and sunk. Virginia, I believe you are about
2126400	2127400	to exercise Christian humility by... ...having sex with a woman. I don't know. I don't know.
2127400	2128400	I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't
2128440	2132220	want to hear you 심erely explaining why your barren life of self-flagellation is more
2132220	2140560	meaningful than mine. I walk with the spirit until I go to glory. That's my meaning. Your
2140560	2147520	meaning...is what? To fabricate an already-fading illusion of feminine beauty until you rot
2147520	2155080	away unresurrected in the earth? And for what? To mutilate God's image and to live a lie?
2155080	2157740	Anything else would be a lie.
2157740	2164260	exists I'm sure his mind is bigger than yours and with or without your approval and understanding
2164260	2173920	I will always be the way I am look can't we reach a reasonable compromise I think you should have
2173920	2183360	the right to do whatever sick shit that you're into just leave children out of it like whatever
2183360	2191760	this is keep this away from children and that's why we should increase police funding to fight
2191760	2208860	the war on drugs I'm just trying to help you understand how lost you really are I know my
2208860	2212880	place in this world I've found a love family
2213360	2222400	belonging fellowship in the church have you found fellowship in the lgbt2a dollar sign community
2222400	2230400	well obviously not because it's a bunch of wounded people wounding each other case in point though
2230400	2238320	you are one of the worst I've ever seen so you're alone you're far from God's grace and you have
2238320	2243280	no cat girl gf can you honestly say that you're happy
2243280	2243340	you're far from God's grace and you have no cat girl gf can you honestly say that you're happy
2243340	2250460	that you're fulfilled that you have purpose that you have
2273340	2284060	still you're reliable and open and the way you seem and the reason for being here so
2284060	2288380	that you just be loved is
2288380	2298540	beautiful you say roll over surrender
2299000	2301500	for me
2301500	2302700	impressive
2302700	2303200	right
2303200	2303440	Hello?
2309600	2310040	Jesus.
2311680	2313440	Don't say that name in front of me.
2313600	2314920	How did you get in my house?
2315620	2318020	Oh, I get into a lot of people's houses.
2318960	2319840	Who are you?
2320540	2321320	What are you?
2321320	2324660	Well, I used to be an angel.
2325460	2326300	And now?
2327440	2331320	Let's just say I'm in a different line of work.
2331320	2333820	A satanic visitation.
2334340	2340600	At this time of year, at this time of night, in this part of the country, localized entirely within my bathroom?
2341380	2341860	Yes.
2342440	2344280	Is this going to be a weird sex thing?
2345040	2346500	Do you want it to be?
2346800	2347220	No.
2347740	2349140	Look, I've had a terrible day.
2349140	2350860	I'm really not in the mood for this.
2351620	2353240	Well, I can help you with that.
2353840	2354480	Can you?
2355140	2355620	Sure.
2356040	2357200	I can help with anything.
2357680	2360720	Depression, anxiety, insomnia.
2361320	2366920	Pain, boredom, failure, shame.
2368340	2369340	Shame?
2370340	2371340	Is it the shame?
2371940	2374000	Well, yeah, there's the shame.
2374000	2375660	There's always going to be the shame.
2376140	2377640	But it's a complex cocktail.
2377640	2378560	There's the heartbreak.
2378560	2380440	There's the loneliness, the self-loathing.
2380980	2382500	I'm a parched land, Luce.
2382980	2385640	I've got the hunger, the emptiness inside.
2385740	2388340	Oh, emptiness inside.
2388880	2390220	Well, baby girl, let me fill you up.
2390220	2390900	Let me fill you up.
2390900	2391300	Let me fill you up.
2391320	2394600	I thought you said this wasn't going to be a weird sex thing.
2394700	2396220	It's not a weird sex thing.
2397260	2398680	Potions, Justine.
2399340	2399940	Potions.
2400420	2403460	I have potions that will fill the emptiness inside.
2404640	2405280	Potions?
2406400	2410340	Elixirs, serums, tonics, medicaments.
2411160	2412840	Think of me as a salesman.
2413540	2414720	An apothecary.
2415800	2416300	A dealer.
2417580	2419680	Are you trying to get demonetized?
2420240	2420720	Sorry.
2421320	2423320	What potions do you have?
2423320	2427320	Well, this is one of my favorites.
2427320	2430320	It's called hype.
2430320	2432320	This will make you come alive.
2432320	2434320	You'll jump right out of your shell.
2434320	2439320	Say goodbye to shyness, self-doubt, inhibition.
2439320	2443320	You'll have energy, confidence, charisma.
2443320	2445320	You'll finally get things done.
2445320	2448320	You'll connect with people.
2448320	2450320	You'll always know just what to say.
2451320	2454320	Lucy, the time for that was about 12 hours ago.
2454320	2458320	At this point, I just want the pain to stop.
2459320	2460320	Pain?
2460320	2464320	Well, I surely have something for that.
2464320	2467320	It's called void.
2467320	2472320	One drop of this and all the pain will melt away.
2472320	2474320	The aches of the body.
2474320	2476320	The agitation of desire.
2476320	2478320	The sting of heartbreak.
2478320	2479320	Boredom.
2479320	2480320	Grief.
2480320	2482320	And shame.
2482320	2490320	All of that will fade away under a warm blanket of serenity and love.
2491320	2493320	Yes, I know what void is.
2493320	2495320	But that's a very hard potion.
2495320	2498320	And it's a dark path that I don't want to go down.
2498320	2502320	Baby, it's my job to lead people down dark paths.
2502320	2505320	You'd really rather sit there in your little tub of sadness?
2505320	2507320	All alone?
2507320	2514320	What, do you need a clear mind to process how bad you were on that podcast?
2514320	2515320	Because it was embarrassing.
2515320	2516320	Humiliating, honestly.
2516320	2518320	It was difficult to watch.
2518320	2519320	Shut up.
2519320	2521320	Is it some kind of masochism?
2521320	2524320	You just want to feel all the pain, man?
2524320	2526320	Because you're not impressing anyone.
2526320	2528320	I mean, what is your plan for this evening?
2528320	2531320	You're going to sit around stalking your ex on social media all night?
2531320	2533320	Because that is pathetic.
2533320	2535320	And it's so unnecessary.
2535320	2538320	Because you're choosing to feel bad.
2538320	2543320	When with one drop of void, you can be in bliss.
2545320	2546320	Pass.
2547320	2549320	The cool kids are doing it.
2549320	2551320	The cool kids are absolutely not doing it.
2551320	2553320	Because it's not the 90s.
2553320	2555320	Kids today are vaping Benadryl.
2555320	2557320	Don't you keep up with this?
2557320	2560320	Okay, I mean, I respect your choice.
2560320	2562320	But I'm not going anywhere.
2562320	2564320	I will stay right here.
2564320	2574320	And I will remind you every minute for hundreds of consecutive minutes that your pain is optional.
2574320	2577320	And I have the antidote right here.
2577320	2581320	But I guess you'd just rather feel pain.
2581320	2583320	And shame.
2583320	2585320	And humiliation.
2585320	2587320	And heartbreak.
2587320	2589320	And boredom.
2589320	2591320	Loneliness.
2591320	2593320	Despair.
2593320	2596320	Disappointment.
2596320	2598320	Failure.
2598320	2600320	Anguish.
2600320	2602320	Frustration.
2602320	2605320	Look, I'm a smart person, okay?
2605320	2609320	And I'm not going to let you turn me into some kind of pathetic junkie.
2609320	2611320	Pathetic?
2611320	2615320	Is it pathetic to feel good?
2615320	2619320	Because when I look at you, I see someone who feels bad.
2619320	2621320	And to me,
2621320	2624320	that's pathetic.
2624320	2628320	Well, the thing about that...
2633320	2635320	Okay, just give me the cocktail void.
2635320	2637320	Well, that didn't take a lot of convincing.
2637320	2639320	I thought I was going to be here all night.
2639320	2641320	Well, my will is weak, okay?
2641320	2643320	Can I have the potion, please?
2643320	2645320	Alright, well, let's be a little patient.
2645320	2647320	You should really do this the right way, okay?
2647320	2649320	It's called harm reduction.
2649320	2652320	What you're going to do is put one drop,
2652320	2654320	and only one drop,
2654320	2657320	of pure void into water.
2657320	2659320	This is important.
2659320	2662320	Do not do too many drops.
2662320	2664320	What happens if I do too many drops?
2664320	2666320	Oh, you'll probably die.
2666320	2667320	I'll die?
2667320	2669320	I told you it was important.
2669320	2671320	Well, how many drops is too many drops?
2671320	2674320	Well, it's difficult to say exactly.
2674320	2676320	It depends on a lot of factors.
2676320	2677320	Seriously?
2677320	2678320	But it's your first time.
2678320	2680320	So just do one.
2689320	2692320	So, do I just drink it, or...
2692320	2693320	Of course you drink it.
2693320	2695320	It's a purely fictional magical potion
2695320	2698320	utterly disconnected from any real-world social issues.
2698320	2700320	What else would you do with it?
2700320	2701320	Okay.
2708320	2712320	Good girl.
2712320	2714320	I don't feel anything.
2714320	2716320	Okay, well, give it a minute.
2716320	2717320	In about 15 seconds,
2717320	2719320	you are not going to know the meaning of the word pain.
2719320	2721320	Are you ready for that?
2721320	2722320	Lucy,
2722320	2725320	I have never been more ready for anything
2725320	2729320	in my god damn life.
2738320	2740320	There she goes.
2742320	2743320	Thank god!
2745320	2747320	Well don't thank god, thank me.
2747320	2749320	I will not have a father taking credit for my work.
2749320	2750320	Ahhhhh.
2750320	2752320	The Thin Sleeves
2755320	2759320	Boyfriend
2759320	2789300	To be continued...
2789320	2810380	Lucy? Lucy? Luciferia? Mother? A doctor? Mother-doctor? Doctor-mother? Mom? Mother-void? Mother-void?
2811960	2812520	Yes?
2814760	2818060	Help me, Doctor. I'm being cancelled.
2818940	2819300	Oh, no.
2819320	2823180	So a bunch of furries are mad at you online. So what?
2823760	2827680	You don't understand, Doctor. I'm in love with this furry.
2828400	2832560	You really are far from God. You're further from God than I am.
2832740	2835600	Lucy, can I get a drop?
2836240	2840620	A drop? I thought you didn't want to go down dark paths.
2842000	2843740	Doctor, my pain is at a ten.
2844680	2848920	I thought I was going to get to tempt you all over again. I'm a little disappointed,
2848920	2855300	honestly. I enjoy the thrill of the chase. But there's no chase with you. No chase at all.
2855660	2861680	You're easy. An easy little void slut. A slut for the void.
2862800	2868580	Lucy, if I wanted a sermon, I'd have called the other guy. Please, just give me the void so I can
2868580	2876020	fill the emptiness. If it's the void you want, the void you shall have. But you don't call me Lucy
2876040	2877300	anymore, understand?
2878120	2878340	Yes?
2878340	2887060	call me mommy now because I own you yes mommy dearest
2908340	2935840	you
2938340	2968320	Thank you.
2968340	2974220	Five drops already. Escalating, aren't we?
2974540	2977180	Well, yeah, because one drop doesn't really work anymore.
2978040	2979920	So you're going to do five drops?
2980120	2985600	Just to take the edge off. I need five drops to take the edge off, so I'm going to do five drops.
2986400	2993060	Oh, wow. If it's just to take the edge off, that's a very convincing argument. By all means, continue.
2993660	2996540	Well, thank you for being supportive. Cheers.
2998340	3028320	Thank you.
3028340	3030340	Cheers.
3058340	3068880	That was dumb. That was so dumb.
3074300	3075380	Shit.
3080260	3081900	I need to quit.
3083900	3086400	I've got to quit. I'm going to quit.
3088340	3089860	Oh, you're going to quit, are you?
3090180	3093920	Yes, Mother. I'm going to quit. I just...
3093920	3095760	Good luck.
3096840	3102140	I'll quit after one more drop.
3102240	3102940	Of course.
3109300	3111940	All right, that's it. Never again.
3113620	3114420	I'm quitting.
3117620	3118320	I quit.
3118340	3119000	I quit.
3122120	3127740	It's just a simple matter of giving up the only thing that makes me feel like life is worth living.
3130660	3132140	How hard could that be?
3148340	3158340	No. I can't do this. I can't do this.
3158340	3160720	Shit. Shit.
3173020	3177620	Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Lucy. Lucy!
3178340	3183340	Lucy, I'm with the flurry. Wake up, Lucy. Lucy, wake up. Wake up!
3208340	3210340	I'm with the flurry.
3238340	3240340	I'm with the flurry.
3268340	3298320	Thank you.
3298340	3328320	Thank you.
3328340	3358320	Thank you.
3358340	3388320	Thank you.
3388340	3418320	Thank you.
3418340	3448320	Thank you.
3448340	3453440	Thank you.
