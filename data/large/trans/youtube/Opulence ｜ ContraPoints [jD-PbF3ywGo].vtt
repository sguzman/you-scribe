WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:29.380
Oh, hey, Quaritch.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.200
Hey, how are you, Quaritch?

00:31.420 --> 00:34.040
Okay, listen, I know this looks bad.

00:34.340 --> 00:37.140
I know you think I'm bougie and you're here to take me to the guillotine.

00:37.260 --> 00:38.860
Well, fair enough.

00:39.040 --> 00:42.080
But before you do, can a dying queen make one request?

00:42.580 --> 00:43.260
How about this?

00:43.560 --> 00:46.360
I'm the new Scheherazade, so you can cut my head off,

00:46.460 --> 00:49.020
but first you have to let me tell you my life story.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.240
Fair? That's super fucking great.

00:51.440 --> 00:53.640
Now sit down, bitch, and allow me to explain myself.

00:53.920 --> 00:54.940
I'll start at the beginning.

00:55.720 --> 00:58.660
My earliest memories are of aesthetic bliss.

00:58.660 --> 01:01.240
I was raised in a suburb of Washington, D.C.,

01:01.240 --> 01:03.260
where the most exciting attraction for children

01:03.260 --> 01:05.440
is the National Museum of Natural History.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.500
At least, it's the most exciting attraction for nerdy children who,

01:08.780 --> 01:12.760
might I add, deserve their abuse at the hands of dumber, cooler children.

01:13.140 --> 01:16.140
Kids usually gather around the fossils, and don't get me wrong,

01:16.420 --> 01:19.180
I liked a good Stegosaurus as much as the next five-year-old,

01:19.420 --> 01:22.440
but my real passion was the gem and mineral hall.

01:22.840 --> 01:24.780
Ugh, the sparkle and shimmer.

01:25.020 --> 01:27.280
It inspired me to start my own little gem collection.

01:27.280 --> 01:31.500
I had amethyst, quartz, obsidian, jade.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.940
The little pleasure of each stone was almost enough to make up

01:34.940 --> 01:38.460
for my sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Romano, forcing me to pee my pants in public.

01:38.820 --> 01:41.840
Fuck you, Romano. I'm glad your father died.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.200
Comrades, losers, and haters,

01:44.660 --> 01:47.580
I would like to propose that aesthetic sensibility,

01:48.100 --> 01:51.100
whether for gemstones, architecture, fashion, or music,

01:51.600 --> 01:53.280
begins with absolute pleasure.

01:53.840 --> 01:56.340
You rotate the crystal in your hand,

01:56.340 --> 01:58.900
and are dazzled by the sparkle and the light.

01:59.280 --> 02:00.720
Your nape hair stands on end,

02:00.880 --> 02:02.720
and a tingle goes down your spine.

02:02.860 --> 02:04.000
Yes, God!

02:04.180 --> 02:07.160
But as you get older, things get more complicated.

02:07.760 --> 02:09.980
Northern Virginia is McMansion country,

02:10.260 --> 02:12.960
and while my family lived in a more modest colonial,

02:13.280 --> 02:15.480
I remember riding around in the back of the minivan,

02:15.760 --> 02:18.400
looking at some stylistically jumbled monstrosities,

02:18.620 --> 02:20.720
and I would get excited by some little detail,

02:20.720 --> 02:25.320
like, say, a circle of fake battlements atop a misplaced tower.

02:25.500 --> 02:26.320
But then my mom would say,

02:26.560 --> 02:29.160
Look at this ostentatious trash!

02:29.400 --> 02:30.200
So you learn.

02:30.200 --> 02:33.700
You learn taste, according to the social class of your upbringing.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.860
And with taste comes all this adult baggage,

02:36.860 --> 02:39.860
snobbery, and pretense and conceit.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.140
So I don't know what you've heard from my accusers,

02:42.140 --> 02:45.300
but I assure you, I have nothing to do with taste.

02:45.300 --> 02:49.780
I am but a simple queen, longing for the pleasure of my childhood gems.

02:49.780 --> 02:54.200
So, stripey sock cat girls of the heckin' revolutionary committee,

02:54.200 --> 02:55.780
before you pass sentence,

02:56.340 --> 02:58.340
allow me to make my case, Gorge.

03:17.440 --> 03:19.440
One, success.

03:21.060 --> 03:22.800
Oh, hey, how are you, Gorge?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.240
Look, I like stuff.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.240
I like shiny things.

03:26.340 --> 03:30.200
For me, there really is still a simple, childlike pleasure to it all.

03:30.200 --> 03:34.820
But the adult reality is, opulence is more than just shimmer and sparkle.

03:34.820 --> 03:37.120
There's a social context for it.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.420
It generally means something.

03:39.420 --> 03:43.640
Why does Donald Trump's apartment look like Liberace married a Turkmenistani dictator

03:43.640 --> 03:45.560
and moved into a cheesecake factory?

03:45.560 --> 03:48.080
Well, because he's trying to send a message.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.500
Maybe to the world.

03:49.500 --> 03:50.500
Maybe to himself.

03:50.500 --> 03:51.500
He's saying,

03:51.500 --> 03:52.500
Behold!

03:52.500 --> 03:53.500
I am a winner.

03:53.500 --> 03:54.560
A very stable genius, with one of the highest.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.060
I am a winner.

03:55.060 --> 03:55.560
I am a winner.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.560
One of the highest IQs.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.800
Powerful people have often used opulence to symbolize their power.

04:00.800 --> 04:03.260
From the pharaohs of Egypt, to the kings of France,

04:03.260 --> 04:06.320
to even the humble servants of the world's major religions.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.560
I guess God likes shiny things, too.

04:08.560 --> 04:13.400
In America, opulence more specifically means not just power, but success.

04:13.400 --> 04:18.040
It is the trophy by which you show the world that you've achieved the American dream.

04:18.040 --> 04:22.040
The plotline of our central cultural myth is the story of rags to riches.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.040
In the words of Drake,

04:23.040 --> 04:24.040
Started from the bottom, now we're here.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.040
We're here.

04:25.040 --> 04:25.540
We're here.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.880
Started from the bottom, now the whole team's fucking here.

04:29.880 --> 04:33.400
Opulence is the aesthetic display that you're here.

04:33.400 --> 04:34.400
You've made it.

04:34.400 --> 04:35.400
You're rich, bitch.

04:35.400 --> 04:39.940
Remember in high school when you had to read The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Sparknotes?

04:39.940 --> 04:44.060
The character Jay Gatsby doesn't even like opulent mansion parties, but he throws them

04:44.060 --> 04:49.040
anyway just to show his crush Daisy that he's made it, that he's a success, that he's

04:49.040 --> 04:50.040
worth something.

04:50.040 --> 04:54.380
And as we all remember, in the end, they get married and defeat the monster Grendel to

04:54.380 --> 04:55.380
save the Hall of Hrothgar.

04:55.560 --> 04:59.900
At least, that's what I wrote in my 10th grade English essay about how the theme of

04:59.900 --> 05:04.100
The Great Gatsby is money always leads to happiness.

05:04.100 --> 05:05.100
I got a D-.

05:05.100 --> 05:10.800
I like dollars, I like diamonds, I like money, I like shining, I like those Balenciagas.

05:10.800 --> 05:11.800
Fuck.

05:11.800 --> 05:15.800
I'm sure Cardi B really does like diamonds and red bottoms and driving lambs and all

05:15.800 --> 05:18.800
that shit, but teacher, pick me, pick me.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.180
Let's talk about symbols, let's talk about allegory, let's talk about metaphor, let's

05:23.180 --> 05:24.180
talk about themes.

05:24.180 --> 05:25.400
Fellow students, I'm sorry.

05:25.400 --> 05:29.580
Let us place the text in historical context.

05:29.580 --> 05:34.040
Everyone knows that Cardi B went from being a teenage stripper to making money moves.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.640
That's the American Dream.

05:36.640 --> 05:41.940
Hip-hop opulence isn't just gratuitous glitz and hedonism, it's a celebration of success

05:41.940 --> 05:45.780
for people who often come from backgrounds where that kind of success is really improbable.

05:45.780 --> 05:51.440
Don't you think it's kinda weird that conservatives still say, rap music is the reason for the

05:51.440 --> 05:53.640
problems with the blacks?

05:53.640 --> 05:54.760
For conservatives, the American Dream.

05:54.760 --> 05:58.240
The American Dream is supposed to be the solution to poverty.

05:58.240 --> 06:03.100
And is there any sector of our culture where the American Dream is more unironically celebrated

06:03.100 --> 06:04.100
than hip-hop?

06:04.100 --> 06:05.920
It's not just hip-hop, though.

06:05.920 --> 06:09.160
Flaunted wealth is pretty inescapable throughout pop culture.

06:09.160 --> 06:13.380
You can't even turn on the radio without hearing about the Gucci and the Ferraris and the Fendi

06:13.380 --> 06:15.800
and the Bugattis and the Armani and the Maseratis.

06:15.800 --> 06:21.500
Our entire culture has been replaced by a parade of overpriced Italian bullshit, which,

06:21.500 --> 06:24.560
to be clear, I'm completely in favor of.

06:24.560 --> 06:28.540
Turn down the Statue of Liberty for all I fucking care, and replace it with a large-scale

06:28.540 --> 06:31.440
figure of Donatella Versace holding a bottle of Cristal.

06:31.440 --> 06:35.560
That's at least a more honest representation of our culture than the hypocritical cheese

06:35.560 --> 06:37.800
verse currently inscribed on Liberty Island.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.320
I guess Cristal's French, isn't it?

06:40.320 --> 06:43.140
Well, no one really drinks Italian booze.

06:43.140 --> 06:44.700
We have standards in this country.

06:44.700 --> 06:46.340
Listen up, America.

06:46.340 --> 06:47.620
We live in a society.

06:47.620 --> 06:51.240
A society of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.880
Not of climbers, but of...

06:53.880 --> 06:54.400
Graspers.

06:54.560 --> 07:01.160
To paraphrase Iain Danskin, maybe anyone can achieve the American dream, but everyone

07:01.160 --> 07:02.160
cannot.

07:02.160 --> 07:05.520
And the fact of the matter is, most people don't.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.600
I mean, what would it even mean to be rich unless someone else was poor?

07:09.600 --> 07:12.440
I mean, who's gonna polish your golden toilet?

07:12.440 --> 07:14.340
Not all the rich people, that's for sure.

07:14.340 --> 07:19.060
So when you live in a society that constantly equates wealth and success, but which is also

07:19.060 --> 07:24.120
so unequal that most people will never be wealthy, well...

07:24.120 --> 07:31.720
What's the average person supposed to do?

07:31.720 --> 07:32.720
Two.

07:32.720 --> 07:33.720
Fantasy.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.720
Sigh.

07:34.720 --> 07:35.720
I wish the world were my gem collection.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.720
I wish I owned everything.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.720
I'm really just the worst kind of philistine, you know?

07:37.720 --> 07:43.720
I go to an art museum and it's like, Monet, Rembrandt, okay, that's super fucking great,

07:43.720 --> 07:45.120
but can I buy it?

07:45.120 --> 07:46.120
Well, no.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.120
I can't buy it.

07:47.120 --> 07:49.720
The grim reality is, you can't own everything.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.720
So what do you do?

07:51.720 --> 07:52.720
Well...

07:52.720 --> 07:53.720
You fake it.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.720
You create an illusion.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.720
I don't own this building.

07:57.720 --> 08:02.320
And you boob off the streets of Baltimore and walk in here, as indeed you did.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
But that's okay.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.320
I need a witness.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.320
I need you to see me here, among the other art.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.320
Where I belong.

08:10.320 --> 08:13.320
Being seen that way, it makes me feel good, you know?

08:13.320 --> 08:15.320
Makes me feel valuable.

08:15.320 --> 08:21.320
You know, you don't actually need wealth to be opulent, because opulence is not abundance.

08:21.320 --> 08:23.320
Opulence is the aesthetic.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.720
Of abundance.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.720
It is the aesthetic of owning everything.

08:28.720 --> 08:34.720
The phrase opulence, you own everything is at this point basically a gay internet meme.

08:37.720 --> 08:41.920
But it originally comes from the documentary Paris Is Burning, about the Harlem ballroom

08:41.920 --> 08:45.720
culture in the 1980s, where it's proclaimed by MC Junior LaBeija.

08:45.720 --> 08:50.720
O-P-U-L-E-N-C-E.

08:50.720 --> 08:51.720
Opulence.

08:51.720 --> 08:52.720
You own everything.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.880
You own everything!

08:54.880 --> 08:58.480
It's not a celebration of a real lifestyle of luxury and decadence.

08:58.480 --> 09:03.440
In fact, as Pepper LaBeija says of the queer Black and Latin American participants of the Bulls,

09:03.440 --> 09:06.400
You know, a lot of those kids that are in the Bulls, they don't have two of nothing.

09:07.520 --> 09:09.120
Some of them don't even eat.

09:09.120 --> 09:12.560
So, ballroom opulence is a fantasy of wealth and glamour,

09:12.560 --> 09:15.120
an illusion created by skillful artifice.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.080
Participants walk categories like executive realness,

09:18.080 --> 09:21.360
with the goal of being indistinguishable from a real executive.

09:21.360 --> 09:23.920
Nowadays, every white queer says the word realness.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.760
I guess in kind of a frivolous way.

09:25.760 --> 09:30.720
I mean, Whomst Among Us honestly hasn't slipped into a dissociative fugue state,

09:30.720 --> 09:34.160
dressed up as a clown, kidnapped a few neighborhood children,

09:34.160 --> 09:38.000
and told the cops, I'm giving you John Wayne Gacy realness, hunty.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.520
I did it, officer.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.520
I did the cultural appropriation.

09:41.520 --> 09:42.960
I am a colonizer.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.560
I am part of the problem.

09:44.560 --> 09:45.600
And I'm sorry.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.960
Take me away, boys.

09:46.960 --> 09:47.920
That's crazy.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.520
That's mega coconuts.

09:49.520 --> 09:50.800
I guess I should explain that

09:50.800 --> 09:55.760
American slang works according to what we might call a trickle-up model of linguistics.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.600
All the new words are invented by the most marginalized gay and trans people of color.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.120
Then those words trickle up to straight black people and white gays,

10:03.120 --> 10:05.600
and then finally white cishets start using them.

10:05.600 --> 10:09.200
A lot of times the original meaning or context gets lost along the way.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.320
So originally, realness, as Sean Faye put it,

10:12.320 --> 10:15.840
was not just a sassy byword for a convincing costume,

10:15.840 --> 10:20.320
but a tragicomic disguise of the chasm between what is being emulated

10:20.320 --> 10:25.200
and what is absent, namely racial justice, class equality, and safety.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.680
Realness, in that sense, is a much more complicated and interesting concept

10:29.680 --> 10:32.320
than the generic trans notion of passing.

10:32.320 --> 10:35.760
Passing is just looking like a 5'2 happy baby bouncy bio girl.

10:35.760 --> 10:40.080
Whereas in the ballroom sense, realness has a subtext of defying injustice.

10:40.080 --> 10:43.360
You're using artifice to create the illusion of a lifestyle

10:43.360 --> 10:45.760
that has been unjustly kept beyond your reach.

10:45.760 --> 10:49.680
You're not really an executive, but you're looking like an executive.

10:49.680 --> 10:50.160
And therefore, you're not just an executive.

10:50.160 --> 10:53.200
You're showing the straight world that I can be an executive.

10:53.200 --> 10:55.360
If I had the opportunity, I could be one.

10:55.360 --> 10:56.960
Because I can look like one.

10:56.960 --> 11:00.800
I think one reason there's been a surge of interest in 80s ballroom culture,

11:00.800 --> 11:03.920
such as the FX drama Pose, which is set during the era,

11:03.920 --> 11:07.200
is that it dramatizes an essential truth about America.

11:07.200 --> 11:10.640
It's really important to people in this country to at least sometimes feel

11:10.640 --> 11:14.160
like they're living a luxe life, even if in fact, they aren't.

11:14.160 --> 11:17.920
Las Vegas is essentially an entire city that exploits that need.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.520
Vegas hotels like the Venetian, the Bellagio, and the San Francisco,

11:19.520 --> 11:24.160
are designed to make you feel like a fancy bitch,

11:24.160 --> 11:26.320
even though they're actually just high-rise traps,

11:26.320 --> 11:28.080
designed to lure you in and take your money.

11:28.080 --> 11:29.920
And if there's one thing I can't stand,

11:33.360 --> 11:34.720
it's traps.

11:38.720 --> 11:41.760
But the trap works, because part of what it is to be American

11:41.760 --> 11:44.000
is to want to feel like a fancy bitch.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.280
I actually love Vegas.

11:45.280 --> 11:47.680
I was there last year for the only good YouTuber,

11:47.680 --> 11:49.440
Lindsay Ellis's bachelorette party.

11:49.520 --> 11:52.400
I felt like a fancy bitch, and I wasn't tempted to gamble.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.120
But when I was younger, when I was in my mid-forties,

11:55.120 --> 11:59.120
I did once experience the first exciting stages of a gambling habit.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.920
I happened to go to the casino once out of curiosity,

12:01.920 --> 12:04.080
and had some good luck playing blackjack.

12:04.080 --> 12:06.080
I mean, I wasn't a high-roller or anything,

12:06.080 --> 12:08.800
but my first time I walked out with an extra $200.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.040
And that was a lot of money to me.

12:11.040 --> 12:14.880
At the time, I was working a customer service job making $10 an hour,

12:14.880 --> 12:19.360
so to make $200 in five minutes, that's worth 20 hours.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.000
It's a soul-crushing customer service toil.

12:22.560 --> 12:24.000
Before taxes.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.760
So I went back and I went back, but I never got lucky again.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.640
And fortunately, that was enough to discourage me.

12:30.640 --> 12:33.120
I remember one time as I was leaving the casino,

12:33.120 --> 12:36.480
I saw this man standing outside with this look on his face

12:36.480 --> 12:39.760
that I have never seen on a human being before or since.

12:39.760 --> 12:45.840
Just absolute shock, despair, this deep shame and self-disgust.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.280
The kind of face that says,

12:47.280 --> 12:49.120
I'm gonna have to explain to my wife

12:49.120 --> 12:52.640
that I spent the kids' college savings on a high-limit slot machine.

12:52.640 --> 12:55.200
And there is nothing opulent about that,

12:55.200 --> 12:58.480
nor the people at the slots in wheelchairs with IV drips

12:58.480 --> 13:00.720
trying to pay off their hospital bills.

13:00.720 --> 13:04.720
America, we are a bad country.

13:04.720 --> 13:06.320
Donald Trump is a Vegas man.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.640
He's pulling this grift on the entire country.

13:08.640 --> 13:12.960
And it keeps working because the fantasy opulence of the American dream

13:12.960 --> 13:15.360
is more enchanting to the imagination

13:15.360 --> 13:18.800
than any abstract mathematics of economic equality.

13:18.800 --> 13:22.160
So it may seem like Americans are all under the same spell,

13:22.160 --> 13:25.760
but in fact, there are two very different types of magic at work.

13:25.760 --> 13:28.720
For the wealthy and powerful, opulence is a flex,

13:28.720 --> 13:30.800
a demonstration of their wealth and power.

13:30.800 --> 13:33.120
But for the marginalized and impoverished,

13:33.120 --> 13:37.040
opulence is a simulacrum of the wealth and power they've been denied.

13:37.040 --> 13:40.480
The aesthetic might be similar, but in terms of function,

13:40.480 --> 13:45.120
it's like the difference between a viper and a butterfly serving viper realness.

13:45.840 --> 13:47.520
3. Class

13:48.800 --> 13:49.840
Hey, how are you?

13:49.840 --> 13:51.120
Hey, how are you?

13:51.120 --> 13:52.320
Hey, how are you?

13:53.280 --> 13:54.080
Hey, how are you?

13:54.800 --> 13:57.760
People don't understand how difficult it is to be this blonde.

13:57.760 --> 14:00.400
You know, a biological female that looks like me,

14:00.400 --> 14:04.480
I'm afraid some transvestite psycho is gonna sneak in through a rear window

14:04.480 --> 14:06.400
and I'll have to dial M for murder.

14:06.400 --> 14:08.160
I get vertigo just thinking about it.

14:08.160 --> 14:12.400
I've always found the Marxist analysis of class difficult to apply to the present day.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.160
As a typical modern woman, it's just super fucking hard for me to relate to.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.000
I haven't been hope, and I hope, and I hope, and I hope?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.440
That's praxis.

14:19.440 --> 14:22.080
Like bourgeoisie and proletariat?

14:22.080 --> 14:22.800
Hoompst.

14:22.800 --> 14:23.680
Who is she?

14:23.680 --> 14:25.280
Where's her summer collection?

14:25.280 --> 14:27.600
That's super fucking great, but can't I buy it?

14:27.600 --> 14:31.520
Marx's typical examples are a factory owner and a factory worker.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.320
Now, I could be am Shocker but personally,

14:34.320 --> 14:38.080
I've never met a factory worker, or a factory owner for that matter.

14:38.080 --> 14:42.160
They all must be on a brand trip to China work on the enfm's summer collection.

14:42.160 --> 14:44.640
What's supposed to distinguish the bougies from the proles,

14:44.640 --> 14:45.760
is that the bougies own them out of proportion.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.000
Just give them a sound interessante kick and I'm using all that subactus.

14:46.000 --> 14:50.480
the means of production and the proles work for wages. But what about a bartender who owns the

14:50.480 --> 14:55.760
bar she works in? What about YouTubers? Which side of the revolution are we on? I'm just trying to

14:55.760 --> 15:00.080
figure out where I stand here. Because if the revolution starts on Twitter, my head is definitely

15:00.080 --> 15:04.240
going in the basket. And then I'll have no choice but to do the conservative talk show circuit.

15:04.240 --> 15:08.080
You know, like most people whose brains are detached from their bodies.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.800
Maria Antoinette did nothing wrong, eh, are you?

15:10.800 --> 15:15.040
I feel like a class analysis with only two classes must be overly simplistic.

15:15.040 --> 15:18.560
My favorite book about class in America is Paul Fussell's Class,

15:18.560 --> 15:23.120
A Guide Through the American Status System, which describes nine distinct classes.

15:23.120 --> 15:28.080
Fussell is not as concerned with economic relations between classes as he is with status,

15:28.080 --> 15:31.200
what Marxists sometimes call social and cultural capital.

15:31.200 --> 15:35.360
Things like education, style, taste, and attitude towards money.

15:35.360 --> 15:40.080
Now the book was published in 1983, so a lot of the references and details are out of date,

15:40.080 --> 15:43.680
but there's an eerie familiarity to a lot of the core observations.

15:43.680 --> 15:44.960
And it's also just pretty funny.

15:45.040 --> 15:48.800
Like his quasi-scientific observation that the higher your social class,

15:48.800 --> 15:53.200
the smaller the balls in the sports you play. Or his description of middle class living rooms.

15:53.200 --> 15:58.800
Your real middle class refuses to show any but the most bland books and magazines

15:58.800 --> 16:04.960
on its coffee tables. Otherwise, expressions of opinion, awkward questions, or even ideas

16:04.960 --> 16:05.600
might result.

16:05.600 --> 16:10.320
One of Fussell's core themes is that it's not how much money you have that defines your class,

16:10.320 --> 16:14.800
so much as how you got your money. If you had to work for your money, then you're not

16:14.800 --> 16:20.720
really upper class. The upper class has inherited wealth, and as a result they're very confident.

16:20.720 --> 16:23.360
They don't feel the need to prove themselves.

16:23.360 --> 16:27.840
Likewise, the lower classes have basically accepted their position on the ladder.

16:27.840 --> 16:32.080
But then there's the middle class, who are social climbers, and who compensate for their

16:32.080 --> 16:37.360
insecurities by, for example, placing a pretentious collage of university bumper

16:37.360 --> 16:41.760
stickers on the back of the family car. This is the meaning of the Lord Melbourne quote.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.640
The higher and lower classes, there's some good in them, but, uh,

16:44.800 --> 16:49.840
the middle classes are all affectation and conceit and pretense and concealment.

16:49.840 --> 16:55.360
Now, opulent aesthetics are typically cultivated by people with something to prove,

16:55.360 --> 16:59.360
whether it's marginalised ballroom performers proving their worth to themselves,

16:59.360 --> 17:02.960
or the new rich building McMansions to show off their wealth to others.

17:02.960 --> 17:07.280
So there's something kind of odd about Donald Trump. He inherited his wealth, so

17:07.280 --> 17:13.280
he should know better than to have golden faucets. But he doesn't. As Fran Lebowitz said,

17:13.280 --> 17:14.640
he's a poor person's identity.

17:14.640 --> 17:20.080
He's a rich person's identity. And that's actually his charm. It's part of his mass appeal.

17:20.080 --> 17:25.040
Trump behaves like a prole who won the lottery. So there's actually something kind of relatable,

17:25.040 --> 17:30.080
unsnobbish, and even pseudo-democratic about the golden faucets. People who have wealth,

17:30.080 --> 17:34.400
but not class, are actually very popular in this country.

17:34.400 --> 17:38.720
We don't like class here, because class is exclusionary.

17:38.720 --> 17:44.560
Whereas anyone can acquire wealth, we tell ourselves, so wealth feels potentially inclusive

17:44.560 --> 17:47.600
of everyone, even though in practice, it isn't.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.600
Now, the upper-class cultural elite in this country, the real classy people,

17:51.600 --> 17:56.080
are mostly very unlike Trump. Instead of being ostentatious and gaudy,

17:56.080 --> 18:02.240
they embrace the reserved old-money values of aristocratic wasps, white Anglo-Saxon Protestants.

18:02.240 --> 18:06.640
Fussell notes, for instance, that they tend to value privacy over showing off.

18:06.640 --> 18:10.560
They like to live at the end of long driveways and houses away from public view.

18:10.560 --> 18:14.320
They dress down while travelling so as to avoid drawing attention to themselves.

18:14.560 --> 18:18.000
These are essentially survival skills of the experienced rich.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.120
If you flaunt your wealth too much, people might rob you,

18:21.120 --> 18:25.280
or they might get envious and come after you with pitchforks and guillotines.

18:25.280 --> 18:27.120
Or worse, taxation.

18:28.240 --> 18:33.600
Old money knows this, but new money just cannot resist the temptation to show off.

18:33.600 --> 18:36.640
I actually wonder if the old waspy upper-class is dying out.

18:36.640 --> 18:40.480
I feel like Donald Trump represents a victory of money over class.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.480
His presidency validates the idea that you can be as vulgar as you want,

18:44.560 --> 18:46.960
so long as you have the cash to back it up.

18:46.960 --> 18:50.320
So the old-class system is dying out, and in its place,

18:50.320 --> 18:53.680
we have universally adopted the mindset of the nouveau riche.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.840
If you got it, flaunt it.

18:55.840 --> 18:58.960
If you haven't got it, find a way to flaunt it anyway.

18:58.960 --> 19:03.200
Now, I'm sure this is all very tragic and disappointing to people of class and taste,

19:03.200 --> 19:08.960
but to a tacky transsexual rhinestone connoisseur, it's actually fantastic news.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.240
4. Taste

19:12.240 --> 19:12.320
4. Taste

19:12.320 --> 19:14.000
4. Taste

19:14.000 --> 19:18.240
Listen comrades, I've been pretty down on opulence so far,

19:18.240 --> 19:21.840
and I could continue analyzing it in terms of inequality and class struggle,

19:21.840 --> 19:23.760
but you already know all that.

19:24.320 --> 19:26.080
That's why you came to cut my head off.

19:26.640 --> 19:30.160
But hold on, is that really all there is to aesthetics?

19:30.160 --> 19:32.080
Marxist economic analysis?

19:32.080 --> 19:35.600
Or the SJW version that makes everything about race and gender?

19:35.600 --> 19:39.200
As the most notorious art critic of the 21st century once said,

19:39.200 --> 19:42.400
But remember that it's both possible, and even necessary,

19:42.400 --> 19:44.000
to simultaneously enjoy music,

19:44.000 --> 19:44.560
media,

19:44.560 --> 19:48.480
while also being critical of its more problematic or pernicious aspects.

19:48.480 --> 19:50.480
So what about the enjoyment part?

19:50.480 --> 19:53.360
Surely you wouldn't be ahead of Queen just for liking shiny thing.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.680
Is there no room for art for art's sake?

19:55.680 --> 19:58.560
The great philosopher and venerable German closet queen,

19:58.560 --> 20:02.080
Fräulein Emanuel Hildegard Marlene Kennedy Davenport Kant,

20:02.080 --> 20:04.800
said that pure aesthetic taste is disinterested,

20:04.800 --> 20:07.600
that is, completely free of any material desire.

20:07.600 --> 20:10.720
Of course, Miss Thing also founded the hashtag nofap movement,

20:10.720 --> 20:13.120
so I don't know how seriously we want to take that.

20:13.120 --> 20:13.840
But it's actually true.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.880
It's actually kind of similar to what Plato said about aesthetic sense,

20:16.880 --> 20:20.240
that it merely begins with a desire for the bodies of beautiful boys,

20:20.240 --> 20:24.160
which is really just a shadow of our true longing for the concept of beauty itself.

20:24.160 --> 20:28.400
God, the entire history of Western aesthetic philosophy is just a bunch of repressed homos

20:28.400 --> 20:30.960
trying to rationalize away their debased perversions.

20:30.960 --> 20:32.240
What must that be like?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.640
From the bottom of my motherfucking and my fatherfucking heart,

20:34.640 --> 20:38.320
that must be super fucking hard for them, I can't even imagine.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.920
I mean, it makes sense, really.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.760
Straight men don't have these problems.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.680
They got away with painting softcore for 500 years.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.120
They never had to think about it.

20:45.120 --> 20:46.640
I guess Nietzsche is the exception.

20:46.640 --> 20:51.680
He was straight and a philosopher, but he was an incel and, let's be honest,

20:51.680 --> 20:53.120
definitely a chaser.

20:53.120 --> 20:56.240
The only upstanding aesthetician in all of Western history is the

20:56.800 --> 20:59.360
respectable English gentleman, Oscar Wilde.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.560
According to Wilde,

21:00.560 --> 21:06.240
Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming.

21:06.240 --> 21:07.520
This is a fault.

21:07.520 --> 21:12.160
Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.

21:12.160 --> 21:13.520
For these, there is hope.

21:13.520 --> 21:18.400
They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.240
Spoken like a poet.

21:20.240 --> 21:21.840
You want to be cultivated, don't you?

21:22.480 --> 21:23.920
Don't you think I'm beautiful?

21:23.920 --> 21:25.360
Look, I'll play it your way.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.320
Let's swing back to the other side of the Sarkeesian pendulum here.

21:30.880 --> 21:35.040
As sentimental as I personally am about art for art's sake and all of that,

21:35.040 --> 21:37.600
but from a strictly sociological perspective,

21:37.600 --> 21:42.000
I have to admit, taste is pretty intimately related to power.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.040
When you go to a museum,

21:43.040 --> 21:47.840
you look at various objects on pedestals under special lighting that makes them appear magical.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.160
Now, that's also what you do in Bed Bath & Beyond,

21:50.160 --> 21:53.840
but the difference is that at the museum, you can't buy anything.

21:53.840 --> 21:56.800
And that turns out to be important for Kantian reasons.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.680
In the retail context of commodity fetishism,

21:59.680 --> 22:03.200
you correlate your aesthetic taste with material desire.

22:03.200 --> 22:07.040
Whereas in the museum, because you can't buy anything,

22:07.040 --> 22:09.680
you feel like your aesthetic pleasure is pure,

22:09.680 --> 22:12.880
that you're simply enjoying out of context objects.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.720
But of course, that's an illusion.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.640
The museum is the context,

22:16.640 --> 22:20.640
and the context is telling you that the things you're looking at are art.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.960
So whoever decides what's in the museum,

22:22.960 --> 22:24.960
decides what good taste is,

22:24.960 --> 22:26.080
what's beautiful,

22:26.080 --> 22:27.040
what's valuable.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.320
Think about the music video for Ape Shit by the Carters.

22:30.320 --> 22:33.760
Beyonce and Jay-Z pose in various places in the Louvre,

22:33.760 --> 22:38.320
conferring upon themselves the status and the cultural grandeur of the art.

22:38.320 --> 22:39.840
But it's not just a flex.

22:39.840 --> 22:41.680
It means something more than that

22:41.680 --> 22:42.880
because of the racial disparity.

22:42.880 --> 22:48.000
Black people and black art are mostly excluded from museums like the Louvre.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.800
So seeing Jay and Bey there looking so regal,

22:50.800 --> 22:54.480
with black dancers even overshadowing canonical European art,

22:54.480 --> 22:56.320
it's like a full moment.

22:56.320 --> 23:02.400
A lot of people have a deep longing for the sense of dignity and grandeur conferred by classical art.

23:02.400 --> 23:08.000
That's why trans women love that picture someone photoshopped of the three graces, but with dicks.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.520
I'll admit that silly picture actually had an emotional effect on me.

23:11.520 --> 23:20.800
Because here in The West, it's actually hard to think of your body type as beautiful until you've seen it sculpted in white marble.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.280
Oh, speaking of which, white marble is a lie.

23:25.280 --> 23:34.880
For most of art history history, scholars have insisted that the iconic ghostly whiteness of classical statues was a distinguishing feature of western sculpture,

23:34.880 --> 23:38.640
proof of the elegant taste of the ancient Greeks and Romans.

23:38.640 --> 23:41.520
In reality, of course, it turns out they were painted the color white,

23:41.520 --> 23:44.180
of something a drag queen might wear to a quinceanera.

23:44.180 --> 23:47.060
Scholars had been noticing paint remnants on these statues

23:47.060 --> 23:50.260
for hundreds of years, but were totally in denial about it

23:50.260 --> 23:52.360
because the pure whiteness of these figures

23:52.360 --> 23:53.920
was like a sacred dogma.

23:53.920 --> 23:55.620
Margaret Talbot in the New Yorker

23:55.620 --> 23:57.880
attributes the dogma in part to

23:57.880 --> 24:00.200
a tendency to equate whiteness

24:00.200 --> 24:03.360
with beauty, taste, and classical ideals,

24:03.360 --> 24:07.560
and to see color as alien, sensual, and garish.

24:07.560 --> 24:11.760
In 2008, Fabio Berri, an art historian

24:11.760 --> 24:14.160
who is now at Stanford, complained that

24:14.160 --> 24:16.780
a boldly colored recreation of a statue

24:16.780 --> 24:19.920
of the Emperor Augustus at the Vatican Museum

24:19.920 --> 24:23.080
looked like a cross-dresser trying to hail a taxi.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.540
Hey, how are you?

24:25.540 --> 24:28.360
And you just know that when the news first broke,

24:28.360 --> 24:31.320
some horrified WASP classicist turned to a colleague

24:31.320 --> 24:36.320
and said, oh, Kingsley, it looks, it looks Mexican.

24:37.560 --> 24:41.200
In fact, for the crime of writing about paint on statues,

24:41.200 --> 24:44.480
some art historians have been harassed by the alt-right,

24:44.480 --> 24:46.680
who don't take kindly to anyone questioning

24:46.680 --> 24:49.180
their white supremacist myths about antiquity.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.300
There's some pretty insidious, uh,

24:51.300 --> 24:53.620
identitarian prejudices here

24:53.620 --> 24:56.100
hiding out under the cloak of taste.

24:56.100 --> 24:59.040
Good taste for upper and middle class white people

24:59.040 --> 25:01.540
generally includes a reflexive disdain

25:01.540 --> 25:05.540
for anything a little bit too colorful.

25:05.540 --> 25:06.560
It's these classes that constantly use, you know,

25:06.560 --> 25:07.520
the word, white supremacy, and white supremacy,

25:07.520 --> 25:11.800
they use the words gaudy, garish, tawdry, tacky.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.840
Joe Weldon, author of Fierce,

25:13.840 --> 25:16.580
The History of Leopard Print, observes that

25:16.580 --> 25:20.180
tacky as a concept refers to the lack of cultivation

25:20.180 --> 25:21.880
or the resistance to taste,

25:21.880 --> 25:24.340
and more often than not refers to tastes

25:24.340 --> 25:26.340
that are not suitably conservative.

25:26.340 --> 25:29.700
Furthermore, tacky is likely to be feminine, ethnic,

25:29.700 --> 25:33.220
queer, deviant, not manly, not practical,

25:33.220 --> 25:36.040
not business-like, not serious.

25:36.040 --> 25:37.520
Aesthetic excess.

25:37.520 --> 25:40.720
Particularly of colors, patterns, and bling

25:40.720 --> 25:44.520
is especially offensive to conservative wasp taste.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.440
Tacky is often where the imagination runs free,

25:47.440 --> 25:51.320
where the heart is, where the soul is, and where the fun is.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.460
Well, that's good news,

25:52.460 --> 25:54.940
because people call my aesthetic tacky all the time.

25:54.940 --> 25:56.320
I can't imagine why.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.180
Let me just get some more jewels on my tits.

25:58.180 --> 25:59.320
Or camp.

25:59.320 --> 26:00.680
People call me camp,

26:00.680 --> 26:03.600
and sometimes I don't know if I'm being praised or insulted.

26:03.600 --> 26:06.140
I suppose it depends on what camp means.

26:06.140 --> 26:07.440
Camp was the theme of this year's

26:07.440 --> 26:09.780
Met Gala, and my feed was flooded

26:09.780 --> 26:12.800
with Brooklynite intellectuals competing to outwit each other

26:12.800 --> 26:16.100
with the most erudite definition of what camp really is.

26:16.100 --> 26:19.240
What I gather is there's a couple competing definitions.

26:19.240 --> 26:21.080
The first I'll call coward camp,

26:21.080 --> 26:24.860
this bratty, hipster notion of having bad taste on purpose.

26:24.860 --> 26:27.520
I have no respect for this whatsoever.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.280
This is nothing but an anxious

26:29.280 --> 26:31.840
and defensive refusal to take a risk.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.680
You think you're safe from criticism

26:33.680 --> 26:35.840
because your look is bad on purpose.

26:35.840 --> 26:36.840
Fuck that.

26:36.840 --> 26:38.900
Don't take a stand, you pussy bitch.

26:38.900 --> 26:42.880
I take great offense to this as a person whose look is bad on accident,

26:42.880 --> 26:44.960
and Susan Sontag agrees with me.

26:44.960 --> 26:47.200
In Notes on Camp, she distinguishes between

26:47.200 --> 26:49.660
naive and deliberate camp.

26:49.660 --> 26:52.620
Pure camp is always naive.

26:52.620 --> 26:57.160
Camp which knows itself to be camp or camping is usually less satisfying.

26:57.160 --> 27:00.600
Sontag defines naive camp as failed seriousness,

27:00.600 --> 27:04.080
a grand artistic vision that gets a little out of control

27:04.080 --> 27:06.000
and enters into absurd territory.

27:06.840 --> 27:07.840
Hey, how are you?

27:07.840 --> 27:08.840
I don't know.

27:08.840 --> 27:12.520
My philosophy of style is that people should wear what looks good to them.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.680
I was joking earlier when I said my look is bad on accident.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.820
I think my aesthetic is good.

27:17.820 --> 27:21.960
This is what looks good to me, though I'm aware other people might judge it.

27:21.960 --> 27:27.020
I like what John Waters said about there being good bad taste and bad bad taste.

27:27.020 --> 27:32.620
One must remember, there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.

27:32.620 --> 27:36.000
To understand bad taste, one must have very good taste.

27:36.000 --> 27:36.720
I've wondered.

27:36.720 --> 27:41.320
I've wondered for a long time why I'm so attracted to bad taste.

27:41.320 --> 27:44.960
Like, I technically have the education to know better.

27:44.960 --> 27:49.020
I know about Glenn Gould, but I prefer Liberace.

27:49.020 --> 27:50.680
Why am I so tacky?

27:50.680 --> 27:55.660
I think it's because I'm a transsexual, which lowers you at least a class.

27:55.660 --> 28:00.180
If you were born upper class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now, bitch.

28:00.180 --> 28:04.480
If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.

28:04.480 --> 28:05.480
And if you were born lower class and you're transsexual, you're middle class now, bitch.

28:05.480 --> 28:06.480
If you were born middle class and you're transsexual, you are now lower class.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.480
And if you were born sexual-

28:07.480 --> 28:09.460
Oh, sweaty.

28:09.460 --> 28:11.500
You'd better start a revolution.

28:11.500 --> 28:12.500
Marsha P. Johnson?

28:12.500 --> 28:13.500
Hey, how're you?

28:13.500 --> 28:16.620
CHICKS WITH BRETT.

28:16.620 --> 28:19.080
5.

28:19.080 --> 28:20.200
GLAMOUR

28:20.200 --> 28:22.740
Trans women have a special relationship with glamour.

28:22.740 --> 28:24.820
At least, those of us who came of age in the 1960s.

28:24.820 --> 28:29.540
At least the most basic everyday sense, GLAM is a way of styling yourself.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.420
It is luxuriant hair.

28:31.420 --> 28:33.000
It's high drama makeup.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.260
It's long nails.

28:34.260 --> 28:35.140
It's glitter everywhere.

28:35.140 --> 28:36.200
It's posing like a fellow human.

28:36.200 --> 28:41.000
a fashion model but originally the word glamour comes from the scottish word grammary meaning

28:41.000 --> 28:48.040
magic or enchantment and glamour still involves a kind of illusion or charm cast on a spectator

28:48.040 --> 28:53.800
the connection between glamour and opulence is explored in the 2004 essay viva mcglam is

28:53.800 --> 28:59.400
transgenderism a critique of or capitulation to opulence-driven glamour models by transgender

28:59.400 --> 29:05.800
writer and underground house music producer terry temlitz aka dj sprinkles sprinkles writes

29:05.800 --> 29:11.400
europe's ruling elite used opulence as an ideological weapon to befuddle the lower classes

29:11.400 --> 29:17.080
with glimpses of heaven on earth a lifestyle so foreign and unattainable that it could only be the

29:17.080 --> 29:23.160
result of divination it is this spell of opulence that led to our current definition of glamour

29:23.160 --> 29:29.560
which is more associated with wealth than magic sprinkles alludes to an earlier form of glamour

29:29.560 --> 29:35.480
or grammar that was associated with witchcraft paganism and sexual deviancy but in our capitalist

29:35.800 --> 29:42.200
society glamour is a spell of opulence conjuring up what is often a fantasy of a lavish life

29:42.200 --> 29:47.400
for example a lot of drag queens practice this sort of illusionism by impersonating celebrities

29:47.400 --> 29:52.840
thereby acquiring the glamour of actresses pop stars and models second hand sprinkles is bothered

29:52.840 --> 29:57.800
by the way this sort of second-hand glamour acquires its power from unquestioned social

29:57.800 --> 30:04.920
hierarchies glamour is suspect as a critical-minded political forum because it is about social distance

30:05.800 --> 30:11.160
integration the promise of the pop glam diva is not the promise of social transformation

30:11.160 --> 30:17.560
but individual transformation in which the exploited becomes the exploiter it is the promise

30:17.560 --> 30:25.240
of an individual's class mobility not social betterment or class critique it is by and large

30:25.240 --> 30:31.160
the american dream now i have to admit this is a version of the american dream that hits pretty

30:31.160 --> 30:35.560
close to home for me the overarching plot line of my whole entire youtube gender journey

30:35.800 --> 30:40.440
is that i used to be a tragic mess and i'm still a tragic mess but when i started this

30:40.440 --> 30:45.240
channel i was a broke gender dysphoric alcoholic cross-dressing tragic mess

30:45.240 --> 30:49.800
i'd play a clip but honestly those videos are still too painful for me to even glance at

30:49.800 --> 30:54.600
and now i mean look at me look how far i've come i look like a moderately talented female

30:54.600 --> 31:00.200
impersonator hey how are you those first several months of transition though they were rough i had

31:00.200 --> 31:05.640
a lot of trouble in the beginning i used to get laughed out of restaurants and i was so proud that

31:05.800 --> 31:11.320
i wouldn't let anyone see how much that stuff hurt me you know i would say well them i know i'm

31:11.320 --> 31:18.280
great and then i'd go cry my eyes out alone in my car and i was a youtuber that whole time too which

31:19.400 --> 31:24.760
i mean the cyber bullying alone i don't think you can even imagine the extent of it if you

31:24.760 --> 31:30.360
haven't been in that situation you know hundreds of strangers dissecting your voice picking apart

31:30.360 --> 31:35.320
your face and body clocking your clothes and makeup digging up your past trying to deduce

31:35.800 --> 31:42.520
your sexual pathology from the shape of your skull a lot of i mean a lot of it's hilarious to me now

31:43.160 --> 31:48.760
but there was a time when it caused a lot of pain but that pain spurred me to work on my glow up

31:48.760 --> 31:54.680
like it was the cure for cancer like my life depended on it which is basically how it felt

31:54.680 --> 32:01.880
now sometimes my trans critics mischaracterize me as as one tweeter put it cripplingly obsessed with

32:01.880 --> 32:05.400
passing and passing in day-to-day life was always a goal for me but that was something that i wanted to

32:05.400 --> 32:12.280
do for me but glam to me is not about passing i think i actually pass better in no makeup than i

32:12.280 --> 32:16.760
do an eye shadow out to here you know a cis woman can wear eyeshadow out to here and people think

32:16.760 --> 32:22.360
she's just really into makeup or instagram or cosplay or something but when i do it i think

32:22.360 --> 32:30.600
it looks like drag which serves to call more attention to my situation but on youtube i mean

32:30.600 --> 32:35.240
clearly i don't try to pass as a normal woman everyone here knows i'm trans anyway so i'm not going to pass as a normal woman

32:35.400 --> 32:41.400
what's the point i would describe this presentation as female impersonator and that's basically what

32:41.400 --> 32:47.880
i am a female female impersonator and i present this way because it's fun i find it artistically

32:47.880 --> 32:52.920
fulfilling and let's be honest there's part of me that always wanted to be that kind of

32:52.920 --> 32:58.520
larger-than-life superwoman but i'm also creating special effects for the camera as sprinkles says

32:58.520 --> 33:04.760
glamour offers a strange over-performance of gender signifiers a tenuously woven layer of super

33:05.400 --> 33:11.800
which is so distracting that it successfully hides the transgendered body beneath now a lot of

33:11.800 --> 33:17.560
leftist trans people have grown disillusioned with the individual class mobility represented

33:17.560 --> 33:23.640
by glamour as well as by transition glow-up narratives and i think that disillusionment

33:23.640 --> 33:29.080
and a growing revolutionary sentiment are at the heart of this intense anger and resentment

33:29.080 --> 33:34.920
i've noticed a lot of trans women have for drag queens for glamorous trans instagram models and

33:35.720 --> 33:42.520
let's be honest for me here's sprinkles one more time as long as an mtf's public acceptance is

33:42.520 --> 33:47.480
gauged by her ability to emulate glamorous body and style requirements that elude most

33:47.480 --> 33:53.480
quote real women then i'll have to ask you to pardon this transgendered writer for not feeling

33:53.480 --> 34:00.360
represented by rupaul any more than my mother feels represented by marilyn monroe or princess

34:00.360 --> 34:05.320
die a lot of trans women are basically fed up with having to serve the world of fantasy

34:05.400 --> 34:10.280
all the time they want to be seen for who they are without doing any of that they're fed up

34:10.280 --> 34:17.160
with glamour they're fed up with realness they're fed up with rupaul and a lot of them are pretty

34:17.160 --> 34:25.160
fed up with me and i open i open six envy the marxist art critic john berger called glamour

34:25.160 --> 34:30.920
the happiness of being envied being envied is a solitary form of reassurance

34:30.920 --> 34:35.320
it depends precisely upon not sharing your experiences with those who envy you

34:35.400 --> 34:40.840
but being envied is a form of happiness only in the imagination the actual experience of being

34:40.840 --> 34:47.880
envied sucks this is the risk of opulence it invites not just enchanted admiration but also

34:47.880 --> 34:55.160
envy and where envy goes the guillotine follows or at least vindictive taxation this is why the

34:55.160 --> 35:00.520
experienced rich know to tone down the opulence build a nice high wall around their properties

35:00.520 --> 35:05.160
and make a lot of high-profile charitable donations we could call this kind of strategizing

35:05.400 --> 35:11.160
the public relations of success it certainly helps to have a rags to riches story especially if you

35:11.160 --> 35:16.680
can make other people feel included in some way in your success that's part of the appeal of hip-hop

35:16.680 --> 35:22.120
opulence is that it seems to elevate not just a single performer but an entire underclass

35:22.680 --> 35:29.320
conversely being perceived as exclusionary elitist or snobbish is going to cost you big in terms of

35:29.320 --> 35:35.240
envy management youtube music critic todd in the shadows did a review of ariana grande's song seven

35:35.400 --> 35:40.360
rings in which he basically drags ariana who apparently is white for appropriating a bunch

35:40.360 --> 35:45.240
of hip-hop rags to riches signifiers without any of the subtext of starting from the bottom

35:45.240 --> 35:52.040
she's not showcasing a triumph over adversity she's just a white girl who likes stuff we started

35:52.040 --> 35:58.280
from the bottom now the whole team is here so in todd's words the song is a grotesque bullying

35:58.280 --> 36:04.600
vip only privilege flex of a mean girl shoving her wealth in your face i actually like that song but

36:05.400 --> 36:11.560
i'm into that sort of thing bully me mommy oh fellow students as a case study in the public

36:11.560 --> 36:17.880
relations of success and envy management let us compare and contrast two successful youtubers

36:17.880 --> 36:22.840
jeffree star and gigi gorgeous there's enough similarities between them for the differences to

36:22.840 --> 36:28.360
be interesting they're both lgb and or t they're both white they're both blonde sometimes they're

36:28.360 --> 36:34.120
both feminine they're both rich and they both flaunt their opulent lifestyles but nonetheless

36:35.400 --> 36:42.440
they seem to like jeffree star whereas gigi well i don't want to say people don't like her but

36:42.440 --> 36:48.760
they don't relate to her the best example of this is her 2017 video i wear walmart for a week

36:48.760 --> 36:55.480
with its gasp inducing life to dislike ratio let's analyze what went wrong here so for today's video

36:55.480 --> 37:01.080
i thought we would take it to a place i've never been walmart so that's a bad start gorge

37:01.080 --> 37:05.400
most americans have been to walmart never having been marks your upbringing as a woman

37:05.400 --> 37:11.240
as upper middle class at least treating going to walmart as some kind of challenge kind of comes

37:11.240 --> 37:16.280
across as you and your rich friends being like what if we pretend to be poor for a day i wonder

37:16.280 --> 37:22.920
if we're gonna see any people at walmart you know that website baby's crying the trauma gigi no you

37:22.920 --> 37:28.200
need to turn the shade down like like 20 notches gorge i keep taking my on this cart i'm

37:28.200 --> 37:34.680
literally gonna have bruises can someone remake these carts please it's dangerous they're gonna

37:35.400 --> 37:46.040
gorge what should we get next it's maybe like a gown for a red carpet do they sell gowns here

37:46.040 --> 37:52.120
this to me is peak gigi strolling down the aisles of walmart with a two liter bottle of mountain dew

37:52.120 --> 37:58.360
that she's plucked from the shelves saying i need something for a red carpet do they have gowns here

37:58.360 --> 38:04.920
this to me is an iconic fashion moment this is naive camp this is everything the idea that she

38:05.400 --> 38:21.020
is giving people the privilege of a body first

38:21.020 --> 38:24.680
this is the second time i've done a close reading of a gg

38:24.680 --> 38:29.800
video it's getting kinda weird also why hasn't she answered my letters step on my throat mommy

38:29.800 --> 38:34.600
now let's look at jeffree star jeffree does similar kinds of videos to gigi he's even done his own

38:34.600 --> 38:34.680
video wearing white and hisété said why do you think you'd do a gg with a bar in black and not an ashley bar on it without a Smackdown Gardener's Stamping her face and then research what you also install as download aproof il Sister

38:35.400 --> 38:40.040
for a day, which people loved. Now my first impulse when explaining the differences in

38:40.040 --> 38:44.760
public perception is to scream sexism. And there's maybe a little of that going on.

38:45.140 --> 38:49.600
I do think a rich woman is more irritating to people than a rich man, but there's clearly more

38:49.600 --> 38:54.900
than that going on here. Jeffree's fans are, I assume, mostly women and not rich women,

38:55.280 --> 38:59.780
regular women. The women who work at the dollar store love him. I'm like your biggest fan.

39:00.400 --> 39:04.540
Ordinary people actually enjoy watching Jeffree flaunt his millions of dollars of designer bags

39:04.540 --> 39:09.100
and clothes because they either live vicariously through him or they see him as aspirational.

39:09.100 --> 39:14.000
It's the same reason why poor people have always enjoyed watching reality TV shows about the

39:14.000 --> 39:19.600
extremely wealthy. The centerpiece of Jeffree Star's brand is that he's self-made. He represents

39:19.600 --> 39:24.040
himself as having started from the bottom. You know, he talks about his white trash upbringing

39:24.040 --> 39:29.500
and just generally seems like he hasn't let his wealth go to his head. A good example of this is

39:29.500 --> 39:34.280
his private jet Burger King mukbang. Now at first you might think that a private jet is not very

39:34.280 --> 39:34.520
relatable. But it's not. It's not. It's not. It's not. It's not.

39:34.540 --> 39:40.760
But the Burger King aspect brings it back down to earth. Jeffree seems like he's been to Burger

39:40.760 --> 39:46.220
King before. He's able to order fluently. He's even kind of charming to the cashier. He doesn't

39:46.220 --> 39:53.800
like scoff or pinch his nose at anything. Also, the Gucci barrette. Whereas Gigi, I mean, don't

39:53.800 --> 39:59.380
get me wrong, I do love Gigi, but I don't know if sis would make it out of Burger King alive.

39:59.380 --> 40:04.040
You know, she'd commit some terrible upper-class solacism. Like, I don't know,

40:04.040 --> 40:08.980
not understanding the concept of a value meal. I'm sure Gigi would make an entertaining video,

40:09.160 --> 40:14.660
just not a relatable video. You know, she'd somehow contract syphilis from the toilet seat

40:14.660 --> 40:18.800
and do a story time about that. That's really when Gigi's at her best. She kind of comes back

40:18.800 --> 40:23.040
down to earth whenever she's serving real transsexual housewives of Beverly Hills meets

40:23.040 --> 40:28.600
David Cronenberg. So I'm like, I see this white little chiclet in my hand. I'm feeling with my

40:28.600 --> 40:33.580
tongue and I'm like, oh my God. Economic inequality in this country has always been

40:34.040 --> 40:39.260
controlled by the fact that people basically like the rich. Yeah, we judge people who live

40:39.260 --> 40:46.280
in McMansions and we get irritated by elitist out of touch behavior, but ultimately we have no choice

40:46.280 --> 40:51.920
but to stand. And the people we stand the hardest are people like Jeffree Star, who in a way seems

40:51.920 --> 40:57.560
like a poor person who just so happens to be very rich. Now, if inequality increases enough,

40:57.560 --> 41:03.800
I suspect the standing will stop because it's fun to watch Jeffree Star spend $69,000 in one trip to

41:04.040 --> 41:08.600
a taunt store if what you're doing is fantasizing about what you would buy with that much money.

41:08.600 --> 41:13.880
But if you're thinking about how $69,000 could pay off your life-ruining medical debt or about

41:13.880 --> 41:18.500
how you'd be able to afford cancer treatments for your dying life, this kind of thing will

41:18.500 --> 41:23.780
start getting under your skin. And eventually people will start building guillotines again.

41:23.780 --> 41:29.540
In fact, the only way I can imagine a revolution happening in this country is if rich people start

41:29.540 --> 41:33.620
behaving as badly as possible. So this isn't your dream job? No.

41:34.040 --> 41:36.200
You're free, right? Oh, whatever you want. Okay, great.

41:37.760 --> 41:39.560
7. Ruin

41:42.740 --> 41:51.620
Good evening, gorge. Ever notice how most vampires are like counts or queens or at least rich? I

41:51.620 --> 41:57.560
guess some are edgy biker teens, but I don't associate with that trash. Gothic horror really

41:57.560 --> 42:03.440
got started as a genre with 18th and 19th century novels, which were usually set in an old decaying

42:04.040 --> 42:09.500
mansion. By the late 19th century, the aristocracy had lost a lot of its relevance as a class,

42:09.500 --> 42:15.560
so aristocrat vampires like Count Dracula represented a dying world order and also

42:15.560 --> 42:19.880
maybe the metaphorical bloodsucking of commoners by the landed gentry.

42:19.880 --> 42:25.700
Vampires were also usually seducers, and the aristocrat seducer trope had actually played

42:25.700 --> 42:30.860
an important role in turning public opinion against the nobility. So the gothic aesthetic

42:30.860 --> 42:33.800
is an aesthetic of dead and decaying opulence.

42:34.040 --> 42:39.500
And that aesthetic has evolved over time, from the ruins of a medieval castle to the iconic

42:39.500 --> 42:44.660
haunted house, which in American horror is usually a decaying Victorian mansion.

42:44.660 --> 42:50.540
It's a trope with an interesting backstory. During the Gilded Age, industrialization produced a new

42:50.540 --> 42:56.000
wealthy class of people who built what were essentially 19th century McMansions. When the

42:56.000 --> 43:00.860
Great Depression hit, a lot of these Victorian mansions were abandoned and began to decay,

43:00.860 --> 43:03.800
which gave them morbid associations that made

43:03.800 --> 43:08.960
them perfect for stories about hauntings and psychos and weirdos.

43:08.960 --> 43:16.640
So ruined opulence becomes gothic, which kind of makes you think, we live in an age of opulence

43:16.640 --> 43:22.100
and inequality and growing irritation with abusive men in power, the middle class is shrinking,

43:22.100 --> 43:27.920
social unrest is on the rise, it seems like a new economic order could be on the horizon.

43:27.920 --> 43:33.680
When the opulence of our age decays, will there be a new gothic aesthetic of ruined

43:33.800 --> 43:37.580
shopping malls? Well, there kind of already is.

43:37.580 --> 43:43.580
The urban explorer Dan Bell is a YouTuber known for his Dead Mall series, in which he explores

43:43.580 --> 43:48.380
the ruins of abandoned shopping malls, for example, the now demolished Owings Mills Mall

43:48.380 --> 43:53.840
just north of Baltimore. The mall opened in 1986 as the Owings Mills Fashion Mall.

43:53.840 --> 44:00.140
Champagne, gold dust, and pink feathers heralded in a new era for Owings Mills.

44:00.140 --> 44:03.680
Today's opening of the Owings Mills Fashion Mall does not only mean a new,

44:03.800 --> 44:09.380
high-fashion place to shop, it also means lots of new developments and jobs for Baltimore County.

44:09.380 --> 44:14.840
It had a Macy's, a Lord & Taylor, a Saks Fifth Avenue. It was a big, high-end mall.

44:14.840 --> 44:21.380
But in 1992, a woman who worked as a cleaner at Saks was murdered during an armed robbery on the

44:21.380 --> 44:25.940
trail between the mall and the Baltimore metro station. After the murder, the mall got a

44:25.940 --> 44:32.240
reputation for being unsafe, and slowly the stores closed down. Dan recorded two videos at Owings

44:32.240 --> 44:33.380
Mills in 2015, when he was working at the Baltimore Metro Station. He said,

44:33.380 --> 44:39.920
when only five of the original 155 stores remained, he takes us through the strangely

44:39.920 --> 44:48.020
clean and empty halls, the drained fountains, the gutted food court. Watching these videos seems to

44:48.020 --> 44:54.440
provoke an emotional response in a lot of people. Some say they feel nostalgic or sad, some express

44:54.440 --> 45:00.560
rage at the waste and futility, some find it creepy or even horrifying, and some have a dark

45:00.560 --> 45:02.960
sense of humor about the absurdity of it all. One commenter said,

45:03.380 --> 45:11.480
I think it is still hitting people with slow-motion shock that the 20th century is really over. In the

45:11.480 --> 45:17.900
80s, this looked like the start of a big new world of wealth for everyone. In fact, it was the last

45:17.900 --> 45:26.000
gasp of 20th century general prosperity. I agree with all these comments, and I feel every one of

45:26.000 --> 45:33.080
these emotions. I think there is a new aesthetic sensibility emerging here, a gothic aesthetic for

45:33.380 --> 45:40.640
the 21st century, this decaying opulence that is the carcass of 20th century consumerism. Oh,

45:40.640 --> 45:46.520
it gives me a chill, my nape hair stands on end, and a tingle goes down my spine.

45:49.100 --> 45:55.820
The Owings Mills Mall was totally demolished in late 2016, and Dan's final video about it, we see

45:55.820 --> 46:02.240
clips from his earlier Owings Mills videos intercut with absolutely post-apocalyptic footage of the

46:02.240 --> 46:03.320
half-demolished ruin.

46:03.380 --> 46:10.340
It's not like the feeling of exploring a ruined temple or abbey, where you somehow perceive the

46:10.340 --> 46:16.520
spiritual significance of the original building. In a dead mall, you do sense the ghosts of the

46:16.520 --> 46:23.120
shoppers and the workers, their aspirations and material longings, but what does the crumbling

46:23.120 --> 46:30.380
wreckage of a J.C. Penney really mean? That is a question that will haunt me to the grave.

46:33.380 --> 46:41.960
All right, comrades, I've said my piece. I'll come quietly. There's no reason to tie me down. I mean,

46:41.960 --> 46:50.360
unless you're into that. In which case, by all means. No, I won't resist. I accept my fate.

47:03.380 --> 47:05.380
Why am I even here?

47:10.380 --> 47:10.780

Mano. I'm glad your father died. Let's just get that out there before I have to say it.

47:40.780 --> 47:42.340
And let's be honest, definitely a tranny chaser.

47:47.060 --> 47:52.540
Gosh, I sure do think I'm funny. But he was an incel and definitely a tranny chaser.

47:53.980 --> 47:59.040
Look at me. I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed of what I've written. Huh?

47:59.040 --> 48:04.340
Can't, yeah. But I'm saying his name wrong because I'm an asshole.

48:06.000 --> 48:11.880
I hope you're enjoying this there and watching me rub snot into my hands as I shriek naked in a tub full of jewels.

48:12.240 --> 48:15.760
How much leg do we want to get in here? A lot, I assume.

48:16.380 --> 48:19.760
I'm just getting oil all over my fur. Great. It's not real fur, whatever.

48:20.420 --> 48:23.260
Let me clarify that for the vegans in my comments section.

48:23.920 --> 48:27.480
Ugh, moral people. There's one that I can't stand.

48:29.040 --> 48:31.200
It's people who have some sense of decency.

48:31.860 --> 48:33.980
Okay. Is a hair light really a good idea?

48:34.760 --> 48:38.080
Why don't we illuminate my frizziness? Who invented that?

48:38.280 --> 48:41.620
An asshole. But what about a bartender who owns the bar he works in?

48:41.940 --> 48:43.800
I guess I'll say shitty to be feminist.

48:44.700 --> 48:47.040
Christ. The demands of these people.

48:47.420 --> 48:48.640
Those bucky teeth, man.

48:50.960 --> 48:55.060
It's like, it's like being tabby. Tabby, tabby.

48:55.980 --> 48:59.020
That is a question that will haunt me.

48:59.700 --> 49:00.660
To the grave.

49:02.940 --> 49:04.560
So happy and stupid.

49:05.700 --> 49:06.180
Okay.
