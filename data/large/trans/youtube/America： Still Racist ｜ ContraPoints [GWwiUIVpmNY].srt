1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
If you want to have an honest conversation about race on the internet, here's what you do.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,360
You set your computer on fire, you flee to the forest, you drink a mimosa laced with toad venom,

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,920
and you simply wait for the wolverines to eat your legs.

4
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,200
Trust me, you're better off that way. Because if you look for videos on YouTube about race,

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:25,280
well, here's what you get. You get fascism, racist pseudoscience,

6
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:30,960
racist debate fascists, tag team title match tonight at 9, or if you're lucky, you get this.

7
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,200
So perhaps our legal system isn't going around willy-nilly convicting innocent black people of

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,840
crimes they didn't commit. Perhaps individuals who happen to be black are making bad choices

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,480
for which they have to deal with the consequences. Racism isn't the explanation for everything bad

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,680
that happens to black people. If blacks are getting shot and going to jail more,

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,680
it's their fault for committing crimes. That's right. Racial inequality in America

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,200
exists because black people simply decide to commit more crimes for

13
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:55,260
now. That's right. Racial inequality in America exists because black people simply decide to commit more crimes for now.

14
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,320
I guess he's probably going to blame the rap music. Or deadbeat dads with their sagging pants.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,120
I'd say that this is the most common right-wing view of race in America. It's not outright

16
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:09,080
fascism or race realism, but simply the classical liberal view that racial inequality is the product

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,760
not of injustice, but of… black people simply deciding to make bad choices. Usually this idea

18
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,840
gets whipped out as a way to wave away the indisputable facts of racial inequality and

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,880
dismiss those pesky protesters always complaining about things.

20
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,180
Mmm, they make me uncomfortable and I don't like it. This is what I'm going to

21
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,260
argue against in this video. We're going to take a break from talking about fascism. In the past,

22
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,740
I've focused too much on the alt-right. I think we all have. I mean, don't get me wrong, it definitely

23
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,900
is a dangerous movement, but it's just not the most consequential kind of white supremacy that

24
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,140
exists in America. In this video, I want to talk about the real root of racial inequality in America,

25
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,260
which is the structural injustice that disadvantages many people of color.

26
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:49,660
And from now on, I'm going to try not to get so distracted by this circus sideshow of Pepes and

27
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:55,100
racist Odinists and neo-Nazi LARPers. All that stuff, it's very last season. I'm kind of

28
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:00,620
over it. Oh, God damn it. Hello, people. Fritz, get the hell out of here. No one cares about you

29
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,860
anymore. Nein, ich heiße nicht mehr Fritz. Nenn mich jetzt Freya. What? Ich bin jetzt eine Frau.

30
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:12,220
Great. Get out. Well, don't you want to hear about my transition? No, I don't care. No one cares.

31
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,420
You're still a Nazi. Get out. But I'm trans. How could I possibly be a Nazi? That's a good

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:21,500
question. It's almost as if you're an irrational person and your worldview makes no sense.

33
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:25,020
Get out. She calls me a Nazi, and yet she's the one trying to silence

34
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:30,220
my free speech, an excellent example of how truly fascist the left has become. Look,

35
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,900
if your ideas stand up to rational scrutiny, why aren't you willing to discuss them in the free

36
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,740
marketplace of ideas? Well, I'm going to discuss them in the free marketplace of ideas as soon as

37
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,300
you get out of my room. Mom, get out of my life. Well, can we at least talk about the Jewish

38
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:47,500
question? No. It's just ideas. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid that I'm going to have to blow the

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,900
tabby whistle if you don't get out of here in ten seconds. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six. Oh,

40
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,780
baby, come on. I thought you liked to bake. You used to whisper in my ear. I'm afraid that I'm

41
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:58,540
going to have to whisper it to me so sweetly. Well, not anymore. Well, do you at least want

42
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:07,900
to buy some Vitalimax? Hey, Jesus. I don't like doing this. I prefer to have conversations about

43
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,380
disagreements. I don't enjoy waving a bat around and hissing like a cat, but it's these people,

44
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:17,020
they just give you no choice. Where were we? Right, so racial injustice. When I talk to people

45
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,820
about this issue, they often claim to have this experience that leftists react to them in two ways.

46
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:26,620
One, by saying, you're racist. And two, by saying, it's not my job to educate you. And I'm

47
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,700
sure this isn't as universal as people say it is, but it does seem to be an experience a lot

48
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,460
of people have. And that's not good, because most people are pretty ignorant about this,

49
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:39,740
no offense. And there's no shortage of fascists, race realists, and classical liberals who are

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,660
more than happy to educate people in their own special way. So as I see it, the left needs to

51
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:49,820
step it up. Now, to be fair, if you're bothering random people of color on Twitter to demand they

52
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,920
explain racism to you, you're being called a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're

53
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,020
a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're

54
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,060
a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're a racist. You're being kind of

55
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,460
an asshole. And it's true. It's not their job to explain it to you. They have other shit to do

56
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:01,340
with their lives. But I, on the other hand, do not have anything better to do than swerve wildly out

57
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,980
of my lane and white-splain racism to you for the next 20 minutes. Because it kind of is my job,

58
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:10,460
and I have all the time in the world. It's a funny thing, time.

59
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,620
Whose job is it to mend the crimes of history? Do we have to take responsibility for things

60
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,120
that happened a long time ago? I don't even take responsibility for things I didn't do.

61
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,860
July. This person. Who the fuck is that? No, I don't have any white guilt. That's not what this

62
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:32,260
is about. That's just more white narcissism is what that is. So wipe away those white-ass tears.

63
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,660
Here. I'll pick you out a cotton ball.

64
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,020
1. Freddie Gray

65
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,100
On April 12, 2015, three police officers,

66
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:55,160
near a housing project in West Baltimore, arrested a 25-year-old black man named Freddie Gray

67
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:00,160
because he was carrying a spring-assisted knife that maybe was illegal? They handcuffed him and

68
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,520
loaded him into a police van. His leg broke and y'all dragging him like that.

69
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,840
When the van arrived at the police station, Gray was in a coma for some reason, with three

70
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,240
fractured vertebrae and his spine 80% severed at the neck. A week later, Gray died of his spinal

71
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,040
injury while the Baltimore police released contradictory and inadequate information about

72
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,280
his arrest. This led to widespread protests, and the police were forced to arrest him. This led to

73
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,080
widespread protests, and the police were forced to arrest him. This led to widespread protests,

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,760
all over the city, eventually culminating in the notorious Baltimore riots.

75
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,440
Now you might be thinking, what does this have to do with racism? If black people don't want to be

76
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,440
killed, then they shouldn't commit crimes and run away from the police. Well, the first problem with

77
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,240
that is that extrajudicial executions for non-violent crimes shouldn't really be a common

78
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,720
thing in a civilized democracy. And it's a little alarming to me how quick you are to defend this.

79
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,640
And the other problem is that that's a very superficial analysis that refuses to examine

80
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,520
the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more poverty, more crime, and are subject to

81
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:49,600
more aggressive violence than black neighborhoods. And the other problem is that that's a very

82
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,080
superficial analysis that refuses to examine the deeper reasons why black neighborhoods tend to have more

83
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,080
of policing. So let's delve a little deeper, starting with Freddie Gray as a case study.

84
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,640
Gray had a long arrest record of mostly drug offenses, and a lot of conservative commentators

85
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:04,560
brought this out as evidence that he was no angel. The implication, I guess, is that Gray simply got

86
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,800
what was coming to him, that he deserved to die. But why did he commit all these crimes in the

87
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,840
first place? I don't think he was selling drugs for lack of entrepreneurial ambition. Did he just

88
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,600
do it for no reason? Well, let's see. Freddie Gray was born in 1989 in the West Baltimore neighborhood,

89
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,440
Sandtown, Winchester. You can see in this picture of him as a child that he grew up in

90
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,480
a dilapidated row house with peeling lead paint. Lead was used as a cheap additive in house paint

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:33,680
until Congress banned it in 1978 because it causes serious cognitive damage in children,

92
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,000
leading to deficits in attention and increased aggression, which may explain why children poisoned

93
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,880
with lead are seven times more likely to drop out of school, and six times more likely to end up in

94
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,920
the juvenile justice system. But shitty Baltimore slumlords often haven't bothered to comply with

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,040
the Congressional ban on lead paint. And that's not the only reason why Freddie Gray has been

96
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:53,520
banned from using lead paint. And as a result, 93,000 children with lead poisoning have been

97
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,160
added to Maryland's lead registry, and in Baltimore, the vast majority of these children are black.

98
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:02,960
Many of these kids were later awarded structured settlements as compensation for permanent brain

99
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,520
damage, and Freddie Gray was one of these kids. Now, you might be thinking, well, reparations were

100
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,360
paid out, so problem solved, right? Well, unfortunately, no. What's happened is a sub-industry

101
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:18,000
has emerged of shark lawyers who swoop in on the lead poisoning victims, some of whom can't even

102
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,880
believe it, and offer to buy out their structured monthly settlements in exchange for a lump sum

103
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,400
that's a fraction of the total worth of the settlement. And that's exactly what happened

104
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:33,040
to Freddie Gray. In 2013, a company called Access Funding bought the $146,000 remainder of his

105
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:40,560
settlement for $18,300. They also bought his sister's settlements, acquiring the entire $435,000

106
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,800
Gray siblings settlement for $54,000. Now, I hope we can all agree that this is objectively bad,

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,020
but to understand how it relates to structural racism, I'm going to give you a little bit of a

108
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,060
look at Baltimore's history of racial segregation. Or, you know, we could just keep doing livestreams

109
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,260
with Richard Spencer. Interviews with Nazis. The new YouTube craze. God damn it. I need to relax.

110
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,060
I need music.

111
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,700
2. Housing Discrimination

112
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,940
Take a look at this map, which shows Baltimore neighborhoods with children with elevated lead

113
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:18,140
levels between 2010 and 2013, and compare it with this map of Baltimore's racial demographics.

114
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,000
Yellow dots stand out.

115
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,980
Standing for black residents.

116
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,340
And blue dots standing for white.

117
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,180
Lead. Race.

118
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,340
Lead. Race.

119
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:29,100
Also, notice how sharp the divisions are between black and white neighborhoods.

120
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,460
Why, in the 21st century, is Baltimore still so segregated?

121
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,780
I thought racism was over.

122
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:39,900
Well, here's the thing about that. When your country's history is 400 years of slavery,

123
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,260
Jim Crow, and segregation, you don't just get to say,

124
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:46,540
Oops. Sorry about that.

125
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,540
It's all cool now though, right?

126
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:48,940
No.

127
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,220
It's not cool.

128
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:54,060
And these maps are a pretty good illustration of one of the major not cool things.

129
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,460
Let's look at how this shit happened in the first place.

130
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,980
I hope I'm not being too controversial if I propose that, 100 years ago,

131
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,940
America may have been somewhat racist.

132
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,460
In 1910, a Yale-educated black lawyer named W. Ashby Hawkins bought a house in a prestigious

133
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,780
white Baltimore neighborhood. This produced such an uproar among the white residents that the city

134
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,980
passed an ordinance mandating the segregation of every residential block. Basically, the ordinance

135
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,700
forbade black people to buy or rent houses on majority white blocks, and vice versa,

136
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,060
until the Supreme Court overturned the ordinance in 1917.

137
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,260
Well, if the Supreme Court overturned the Jim Crow laws, then what's the problem?

138
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,700
Racism can't exist if black people have all the same rights as white people.

139
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,220
Well, no.

140
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,980
That's actually not correct.

141
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:40,540
In 1934, Congress created the Federal Housing Administration to promote homeownership in the

142
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:43,340
midst of the Great Depression, when many homes were foreclosed.

143
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:47,820
One of the FHA's purposes was to establish a reliable credit system backed by the government,

144
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,860
which would regulate interest rates and ensure the terms of mortgages.

145
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,940
FHA-backed loans played a critical role in facilitating homeownership throughout the

146
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:58,860
middle of the 20th century, the period many white Americans now remember as the golden

147
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,780
age of the American Dream. But many black Americans were excluded from homeownership

148
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,340
and the benefits it conferred to white families, particularly the family financial stability it

149
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:12,460
enabled. So how was this exclusion possible? Well, basically, the FHA, city governments,

150
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,180
and white citizens adopted a variety of subtle methods to enforce residential segregation and

151
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,980
deny homeownership to black Americans. For instance,

152
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,740
1. Restrictive covenants

153
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:25,740
When the 1910 ordinance was overturned, Baltimore's mayor created an official

154
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:30,140
Committee on Segregation, which cooperated with neighborhood associations to pressure

155
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:34,060
landlords in white neighborhoods to sign covenants committing them never to sell or

156
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:38,220
rent to black residents. These agreements were enforced through strategic building and health

157
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:42,620
code citations issued against owners and by evictions of black renters who violated the

158
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,260
covenant.

159
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,540
2. Redlining

160
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,020
The FHA adopted a policy of refusing to

161
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:51,100
insure mortgages in black neighborhoods, which were colored in red on official maps,

162
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:55,660
giving the practice the name redlining. This effectively denied black citizens access to

163
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,180
government-backed mortgages, which, in turn, left them vulnerable to

164
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,860
3. Predatory lending

165
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,820
Unscrupulous white sellers took advantage of black buyers' exclusion from FHA-backed mortgages,

166
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:09,580
exploiting lax regulations to design unfairly-priced installment plans with

167
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:14,220
abusive terms, which allowed, for instance, sellers to repossess and resell homes after

168
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,020
a single missed payment. Many black residents had no choice,

169
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,180
but to buy into these exploitative contracts, and they often resorted to subdividing houses

170
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,260
or neglecting repairs in order to make payments, further contributing to the overcrowding and

171
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,780
decay of black neighborhoods.

172
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:28,300
4. Blockbusting

173
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,980
Predatory real estate agents often used a scheme known as blockbusting,

174
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:36,220
where they'd intentionally provoke fear of an impending minority takeover among residents of

175
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,620
a white neighborhood. They would then exploit the fear that they created to trick white homeowners

176
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,180
into selling their houses at below market prices, so they could resell those same houses at

177
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,860
extortionate prices to black families. The FHA used this scheme to avoid the risk of black

178
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,620
families desperate to escape the ghetto. The long-term effect of these practices was that

179
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,700
many black families ended up trapped in decaying neighborhoods with bad schools,

180
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:59,580
little opportunity, cyclical crime and poverty, and aggressive, discriminatory policing.

181
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,380
And even though most of these segregation practices have ended,

182
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:07,020
the injustice remains unredressed. No reparations have been paid to black families who were

183
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,100
effectively robbed of homeownership during this period, predatory lending having cost

184
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:16,780
black families an estimated $500 million in Chicago alone. But worst of all is that segregation

185
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:21,100
and ghettoization caused by government-backed discrimination of the last century is still

186
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:26,460
ongoing. I'm currently sitting in my gentrifying white fucking neighborhood like one mile away from

187
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:30,140
where Freddie Gray was arrested in a neighborhood that's like a whole different country.

188
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:36,380
Here's the 1937 redlining map of Baltimore. Now compare that to the 2013 population by race map.

189
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,500
If the 1937 map is the product of racism, and it is, and if the city still follows the same

190
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,780
pattern of segregation today, and it does, well, it's almost as if the effects of

191
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:51,900
racism have not entirely been eradicated. And it's not just Baltimore that's like this either.

192
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,580
Here are redlining maps of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Detroit, New Orleans,

193
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,740
Cleveland, LA. All these cities are still segregated as shit, and it's not like a

194
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:06,860
separate but equal situation either. Compare the 2013 population by race map of Baltimore

195
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:11,660
to this map of Baltimore police stops between 2010 and 2015. That's black neighborhoods in red

196
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,060
and green dots representing recorded police stops of black pedestrians. And finally, let's bring

197
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:21,260
back the map of childhood lead poisoning between 2010 and 2013. Now consider this information in

198
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,060
combination with some scientific studies linking lead exposure and violent crime, and it almost

199
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:30,620
starts to look like there's some problems going on here that might not be solved simply by telling

200
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,940
black teenagers to tighten their belts and do less crimes. But I don't want to overstate the lead

201
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:39,020
crime theory either, because that only accounts for a small fraction of what's going on here.

202
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:43,020
The bigger picture is the lasting economic deprivation caused by segregation,

203
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,980
the historical exclusion from homeownership, the lost upper

204
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:50,700
opportunities, the bad schools, and this country's ongoing insistence on treating a problem of

205
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,780
injustice as if it were simply a problem of criminality. I know I said my interest in this

206
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,460
topic isn't a matter of white guilt, and it's not, but also, fellow whites, how do we sleep at night?

207
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:08,300
In this guided meditation, you're going to relax your body and release your guilt. You're not

208
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:14,460
responsible for what your great-grandparents did. As you ease the tension in each muscle group,

209
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,060
exhale deeply, and repeat,

210
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,060
the mantra, black lives matter are the real racists.

211
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,700
3. Mass Incarceration

212
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,980
Since the 1970s, the United States' incarceration rate has rapidly risen to the point where nearly

213
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,020
1 in 100 American men are in jail or prison. We now have the highest incarceration rate in the

214
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:40,540
world, accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's

215
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:44,620
population. More than a third of the total incarcerated population is black, and the black

216
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,500
incarceration rate is almost 2.5% of the world's population. This is the highest incarceration rate

217
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:45,580
in the world, accounting for 22% of the world's prisoners, though we make up only 4.4% of the world's

218
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,300
prisoners, though we make up only 4.5% of the world's prisoners. This is the highest incarceration rate

219
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,340
in the world's prison rate.

220
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:51,660
Now, without even bringing race into it, it's clear that America has a prison problem in general.

221
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:56,060
Sentences are too long, too many nonviolent drug offenders are in prison, too many defendants are

222
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,140
pressured into plea bargains, and a private prison industry incentivizes high rates of

223
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:04,300
incarceration. But disproportionately, people of color are victimized by this system.

224
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,180
Now, a lot of people are going to look at the incarceration data and say,

225
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,220
if the blacks don't like going to jail, they should just do less crimes.

226
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,140
Let's do another interview with Richard Spencer.

227
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:15,340
You know what, why don't we all interview Richard Spencer? Every single YouTuber,

228
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:19,580
free speech mandates that we all constantly broadcast fascist propaganda. Let's get them

229
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:24,300
all in here, every single Nazi in one giant livestream, and then we can finally give the

230
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,620
Jewish question the platform it deserves. God damn it, where's my toad venom?

231
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:32,140
Look, it's just not always the case that black people are imprisoned more because they commit

232
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:36,300
more crimes. For instance, black and white people use weed at about the same rate, but black people

233
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,380
are nearly four times as likely to be arrested for it. And we're talking about a drug that,

234
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:45,260
at this point, white America has basically decided shouldn't really even be illegal anyway.

235
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:49,820
So we've now got a $10 billion legal marijuana industry, and just look what white people are

236
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:56,620
doing to weed. Mark Smith is the CEO of Tumbleweed, a ganjapreneur. It's a strong, strong sativa,

237
00:15:56,620 --> 00:16:01,100
very high in limonene. It's a great bronchodilator, so I like to use it when I work out.

238
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,220
Yeah, so, in fact, in the back of the limousine is only the,

239
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,540
one of the only legal places you can consume cannabis.

240
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,340
The whites are at it again. They have gentrified the marijuana. And now we've got white business

241
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,180
people making millions of dollars selling the same drug that black people are still

242
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,660
disproportionately incarcerated for having sold.

243
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,780
A ganjapreneur!

244
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,460
What do I do with the gold on my fingers?

245
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:25,180
This is the most basic kind of unfairness. And if this doesn't make you angry, then either you're

246
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:30,620
really ignorant about this, or you might just not care about black people.

247
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:34,700
I don't like to assume the worst of people, but when I look at the state of the conversation about

248
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:39,820
race in America, I see a lot of people who are willing to just wave away the extrajudicial

249
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,740
executions of black people by the police, the mass incarceration of people of color,

250
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,180
and the vicious history of discrimination and its ongoing repercussions.

251
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:51,980
And from those same people, I see a tendency to get extremely outraged by any black person who

252
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,580
takes a stand, or takes a knee, or speaks up about this in any way.

253
00:16:55,580 --> 00:17:00,380
There's an endless mill of content about how authoritarian and evil Black Lives Matter is,

254
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:03,900
and how it's identity politics equivalent to white nationalism,

255
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,020
and it's unpatriotic, and postmodern, and racist.

256
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:10,300
And I'm sorry, but this group of creators are being really melodramatic.

257
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:13,660
Black college students complaining too loudly are not Orwell's night

258
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,180
mare. If anything in this country deserves to be called an authoritarian nightmare,

259
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,300
it's locking people in cages for decades over drug offenses.

260
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,740
But right-wing YouTube doesn't seem very interested in using their free speech to

261
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,340
talk about that. They're too busy complaining about people using their free speech to protest.

262
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,300
How dare they?

263
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,020
Now, I can also anticipate another objection that doesn't come from YouTube fascists or stock

264
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:39,100
salad-eating basic white girl caricatures. I imagine some black people will probably watch

265
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,860
this video and think, where does this white bitch get off telling me I'm a victim? I take

266
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,380
responsibility for my own life instead of blaming all my problems on racism.

267
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:50,300
And here's the thing about that. You're actually right in the sense that taking responsibility,

268
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,420
or taking control of your life to the greatest extent possible,

269
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:56,140
is actually a good way to live your life as an individual.

270
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:59,260
So by all means, don't allow yourself to be defined by victimhood.

271
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,660
Do take control of your destiny as much as possible.

272
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,660
So I'm not saying anyone should blame all their problems on bigotry and wallowing victimhood.

273
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,380
Please don't do that. Go succeed as much as possible.

274
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,380
But also, while you're succeeding, don't deny that oppressive circumstances exist.

275
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,220
Yes, it's possible for individuals to escape oppressive circumstances,

276
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,300
but we also have a collective duty to work to eliminate the unjust conditions

277
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,620
that create those circumstances in the first place.

278
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:26,540
Wow. I feel like I just gave a great speech.

279
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,220
Would you take my speech less seriously if you knew I had been drinking Bud Light

280
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,460
Lime this entire time? Look, I even put a lime in it.

281
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:36,620
Bud Light Lime with Lime. The official beverage of people who complain about people who complain

282
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:42,140
too much about people who complain too much about racism. For the final countdown.

283
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,620
I want to say two more things before I flee into the forest.

284
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,780
First, there actually are more racial groups in America than just black people and white people.

285
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,060
I've just narrowed the topic of discussion so this video isn't three hours long.

286
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,460
But there are lots of other kinds of racism in this country,

287
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,380
and someone should make videos about those too.

288
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,020
Second, please don't get all your information from YouTube.

289
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:02,860
I've put some links in the description with my sources and some further reading on the topic.

290
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,380
Also, don't get all your information about race and racism from white people.

291
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,620
Like, come on, that should just be common sense.

292
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,820
So when this video ends, what you should do is scroll down,

293
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,740
smash that unsubscribe button,

294
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,740
unclick that little bell so you no longer receive notifications about my videos,

295
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,980
and then you should go subscribe to a bunch of people of color and listen to what they have to say.

296
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,580
Um, so, I guess that's it.

297
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,020
I was just kidding about the forest.

298
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,820
I don't fuck with forests, I'm really more of an indoor tranny.

299
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:36,060
So, guess I'll just go sing a song about fighting racists.

300
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,740
My eyes have seen the glory of the coming day

301
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,540
The King of the Lord

302
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,540
He is trampling out the vintage

303
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:52,620
Where the graves of wrath are stoned

304
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:56,700
He hath loosed the fateful lightning

305
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,380
Of his terrible swift sword

306
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:07,420
His truth is marching on

307
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,260
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

308
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:16,460
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

309
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:20,460
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

310
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,180
His truth is marching on!

311
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,580
In the beauty of the lilies

312
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,140
Christ was born across the sea

313
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,700
With a glory in his bosom

314
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,260
That transfigures you and me

315
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:37,740
As he died to make men holy

316
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,460
Let us die to make men free

317
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,580
While God is with us

318
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:46,220
God is marching on!

319
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:50,540
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

320
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:54,860
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

321
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,860
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

322
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:04,300
His truth is marching on!

323
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,900
Death to capitalism and the patriarchy

324
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,700
Smash the binary

325
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,740
Hail Satan!

326
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,940
Ow!
