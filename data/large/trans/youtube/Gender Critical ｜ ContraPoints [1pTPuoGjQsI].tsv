0	8480	on the day that the female eunuch was issued in america a person in flapping draperies rushed up
8480	14800	to me and grabbed my hand thank you it breathed hoarsely thank you so much for all you've done
14800	22040	for us girls i smirked and nodded and stepped backward trying to extricate my hand from the
22040	29860	enormous knuckly hairy beringan paw that clutched it the face staring into mine was thickly coated
29860	36600	with a pancake makeup through which the stubble was already burgeoning in futile competition with
36600	43880	a dine-out wig of immense luxuries and two pairs of false eyelashes against the bony ribs that
43880	50520	could be counted through its flimsy scarf dress swung a polished steel woman's liberation emblem
50520	57400	i should have said you're a man the female eunuch has done less than nothing for you
58180	58980	piss off
58980	59400	you
59860	69080	let's go adult human females
69080	82680	first of all a reminder that this video is a female only space so if there are any men here
82680	89140	today get out i mean unless you enjoy watching the very interesting things women do on our own
89140	89840	in which case i'm going to let you know that this video is a female only space
89840	90340	i'm going to let you know that this video is a male only space
90340	96100	like comment subscribe so look it's 2019 and i think most people have heard about TERFs
96100	100340	trans exclusionary radical feminists you know these fanatics like jermaine greer who call
100340	108660	trans women it and think trans men are lost lesbian sisters you guys do know about trans men right male
108660	113260	to female is not the only type of transgender person there's also people who were born well
113860	116820	people who were assigned people who were always
116820	118000	people who are born people who were always
118000	118560	people who are always
118560	118960	people who are always
118960	121320	People who identify.
121320	122760	TERFs don't like being called TERFs.
122760	125640	They think it's a term of disparagement, which it is.
125640	127960	They call themselves radical feminists, radfems,
127960	130080	or lately, gender critical.
130080	132920	The idea is that gender, femininity, masculinity,
132920	135820	gender roles, all that, it's all a patriarchal construct,
135820	137560	and biological sex is the only thing
137560	139180	that makes a person a man or a woman.
139180	140380	In the past on this channel,
140380	143160	I've always caricatured TERFs as being like angry,
143160	145180	man-hating bigots whose only real tactic
145180	147280	is accusing trans women of being creepy men.
147280	148520	And there definitely are some people
148520	150740	who are really like that, but I wanna be fair.
150740	151880	I wanna be balanced.
151880	153960	So in preparation to make this video,
153960	156420	I posted an invitation to Twitter asking people
156420	158200	who used to be gender critical feminists
158200	159520	to share their stories with me.
159520	161020	And I got hundreds of responses,
161020	162400	a lot of them from women who've had
162400	164280	traumatic experiences with men,
164280	167480	and who at one time found comfort in a rigid view of gender
167480	170020	where women and men are completely separate species,
170020	172080	where women are safe and men are dangerous.
172080	174260	And for a lot of those women, allowing trans people
174260	175640	into their picture of the world,
175640	178120	at first challenged their sense of stability
178120	179080	and comfort.
179080	180660	It was difficult emotional work,
180660	183020	work they needed to do, but still difficult.
183020	184180	And that makes total sense to me.
184180	186020	Like it's very easy for me to understand
186020	187360	why someone would feel that way.
187360	189980	So it's not just evil bigots who are attracted
189980	191560	to the gender critical worldview.
191560	193860	And in this video, I don't just wanna parody TERFs.
193860	196700	This time I wanna really engage with gender critical ideas
196700	199440	in the public arena of free speech, open communication,
199440	201040	dialogue, conversation, debate, idea,
201040	202640	marketplace, expression, discourse.
202640	205540	Maybe I'll even get in touch with my inner rad femme.
205540	207960	She's a little shy, sure, but she's here.
207960	210020	Not queer, reads a lot of Germaine Greer.
210020	212660	And when I am having a dark night of the soul sweaty,
212660	215420	she's feeling ex-extra biological.
215420	218440	And when the full moon shines, she speaks.
220180	221780	Oh, this is agony.
222600	224240	I'm a biological woman trapped
224240	226160	in the body of a male narcissist.
226160	227760	Can you imagine?
227760	230360	Okay, so she's a little out of touch, sure.
230360	231600	But she's not a bigot, you know.
231600	233620	I'm sure she doesn't hate trans people.
233620	236700	She just has a few concerns.
236700	237760	You know, it's like you're not even allowed
237760	241180	to ask questions anymore or you're accused of transphobia.
241180	244000	We're all just expected to conform to this gender ideology
244000	246920	that we, the public, never got a chance to debate.
246920	249200	We didn't vote for trans orthodoxy,
249200	251480	yet here we are allowing biological males
251480	253340	to run rampant in women's spaces,
253340	255220	foisting penises on lesbians,
255220	258260	and indoctrinating our children with the ludicrous dogma
258260	260800	that girls can become boys with a change of costume.
260800	263640	Oh, it rattles my chromosomes.
263640	265240	She goes on like that for hours.
265240	267520	It's like being trapped at the bottom of an elevator shaft
267520	269020	with the ghost of Anita Bryant.
269020	270920	Do you kids even know who Anita Bryant is?
270920	272860	Do you have any idea how many decades
272860	274100	I fought for your rights?
274100	275380	Wait, is Anita Bryant even dead?
275380	276980	Scholars remain divided.
276980	278300	It does seem like it's getting harder
278300	280380	to have conversations about difficult topics.
280380	281780	You know, our children are coming of age
281780	284620	in this Orwellian nightmare where you can face consequences
284620	287160	for simply having a politically incorrect opinion
287160	288420	about the Jewish question.
288420	289920	It's PC run AMOC.
289920	292000	It's a Hanna catastrophe.
292000	293300	Problematic banter aside,
293300	295300	the current discourse about transgender issues
295300	297360	is an explosion of untreated sewage.
297520	299080	We have far-right politicians menacing us
299080	300700	with legal discrimination and erasure.
300700	302900	We have fear mongering and hostility in the press.
302900	305280	And that, combined with high rates of family rejection
305280	308100	and mistreatment, puts trans people on the defensive.
308100	310760	So in public, we tend to stick together, concede nothing,
310760	313760	and shield ourselves behind simple, unambiguous slogans.
313760	315560	Trans women are women.
315560	316500	Which is true.
316500	317340	We are women.
317340	319320	But, ooh, that was a sinister but.
319320	320160	Watch out for that.
320160	322160	What happens is that people who don't really understand
322160	324580	trans issues, in other words, most people,
324580	327380	have lots of unanswered questions about the details.
327520	330420	In particular, people who are familiar with feminist theory,
330420	333080	but not transfeminism, might wonder things like,
333080	334160	how can you be a woman
334160	336240	without the oppression experiences of girlhood?
336240	337700	Why can't you just be a feminine man
337700	340480	instead of equating womanhood with sexist stereotypes?
341800	344280	Why are misogynistic gender ideologues
344280	347240	erasing the vocabulary needed to discuss female oppression?
347240	349420	Trans people don't like engaging with these questions
349420	350500	because most of the time,
350500	352740	they're just brandished as weapons against us.
352740	353880	You know, it's like when a man asks,
353880	356040	if society is so sexist against women,
356040	357500	then why is it that men are 90s
357520	360480	and 7% of combat fatalities, feminazis?
360480	362180	Like, you could sit there for three hours
362180	364140	trying to make a nuanced feminist rebuttal,
364140	367620	but wouldn't you rather just eat a bowl of thumbtacks?
367620	368980	Because nine times out of 10,
368980	371680	that guy doesn't give a shit about combat fatalities.
371680	373220	He's just trolling you to shut down
373220	374800	whatever actual point you are making.
374800	376500	And the same goes for people telling me,
376500	378760	you sure do like wearing nails and makeup.
378760	381140	Is that all you think there is to being a woman?
381140	383180	Could you define womanhood for me?
383180	384620	Like, they don't actually care.
384620	386960	They're just trying to make my life worse for 20 minutes.
386960	388860	But if you really are sincerely wondering
388860	390720	about the answer to these troll questions,
390720	391880	and many people are,
391880	393940	then you actually need fairly complicated
393940	395120	and nuanced answers,
395120	397400	which is why they make such good troll questions,
397400	399020	because they waste a lot of your time.
399020	400960	In this video, I want to take at face value
400960	403300	the questions and concerns associated
403300	406000	with gender-critical hostility to trans people,
406000	407960	and I want to try to give nuanced answers
407960	409580	rather than dogmatic ones.
409580	412200	Now, the problem with being nuanced is that it's hard,
412200	414460	so I might fuck something up.
414460	416640	And a lot of trans people want me to represent them
416640	418020	absolutely perfectly.
418020	420080	So, if I do fuck something up,
420080	422460	well, just read me to filth on Twitter
422460	424080	like you always do, you little shits.
424080	425180	Love you.
425180	428100	Let's watch an instructional video to learn more.
429880	431920	Can a man ever be as glamorous as a woman?
431920	434760	We have 13 beautiful women on our show today.
434760	437700	Only the catch is that some of them are actually men.
437700	439240	Oops, wrong channel.
440860	443480	Concern one, gender metaphysics.
443480	446640	There is no such thing as a man trapped in a woman's body.
446640	448960	There are no pink brains and blue brains.
448960	450520	Just because you want to be a woman
450520	451680	doesn't mean you are one.
451680	454980	This whole sacred dogma of gender identity makes no sense.
454980	457200	Trans people often use metaphorical language
457200	459640	to describe feelings that are difficult to put into words,
459640	461380	and that's how I understand the trapped
461380	462700	in the wrong body language.
462700	465080	Is there literally such a thing as a male soul
465080	467380	trapped in a female body, or vice versa?
467380	469020	I personally don't believe there is,
469020	470620	but I'm a little biased.
470620	472940	I sold my soul to a Sudanese businessman,
472940	475400	and all I got in return was this shitty ketamine habit.
477600	480040	As for brains, there is some evidence suggesting
480040	482640	a correlation between binary transgender identity
482640	484180	and cross-sex brain anatomy,
484180	485980	but the evidence really doesn't justify claims
485980	488980	about female brains and male bodies or anything like that.
488980	490560	Brain differences between men and women
490560	492420	are statistical averages of things
492420	494180	like gray and white matter density,
494180	496800	not, as the term female brain implies,
496800	500320	distinct anatomical structures like penises and vaginas.
500320	501900	So I personally don't believe
501900	503600	in any gender metaphysics at all.
503600	505640	I'm kind of an unorthodox trans person,
505640	508400	so much for the unquestionable dogma of the trans cult,
508400	511060	and that I think of myself as a woman who used to be a man
511060	512880	rather than as always having been a woman.
512880	514260	But it's important to remember
514260	516620	that while I may not fit the typical profile,
516620	519200	I am not real and not valid.
519200	521200	But in any case, I live as a woman now,
521200	524020	and that's kind of just what's happening
524020	527260	whether you like it or not, so I'm not sorry.
527260	529860	My view is well expressed by Katherine McKinnon.
529860	531220	I always thought I don't care
531220	533640	how someone becomes a woman or a man.
533640	534600	It doesn't matter to me.
534600	537100	Anybody who identifies as a woman,
537100	540060	wants to be a woman, is going around being a woman,
540060	542160	as far as I'm concerned, is a woman.
543480	546240	Concern two, gender stereotypes.
546240	548020	What do you mean you live as a woman?
548020	550320	You mean you reinforce oppressive gender stereotypes
550320	553340	by putting on nails, makeup, and a fake girly voice?
553340	555120	Listen, sweaty, first of all,
555120	558080	my girly voice is very fucking real.
558080	560680	Second, my clothes, makeup, voice,
560680	562700	none of this makes me a woman.
562700	564600	No trans woman thinks that femininity,
564600	566100	and womanhood are the same.
566100	568380	Rather, we're using a cultural language
568380	570900	of feminine signifiers to prompt others
570900	572380	to see us for what we are.
572380	574480	Sometimes I get the impression that my cis girlfriends
574480	576400	don't really understand why I'm presenting
576400	578500	in such a meticulously feminine way.
578500	581140	Like, they think I'm wearing ombre lips at 11 a.m.
581140	583040	because I'm playing some kind of clout game,
583040	585940	which I am, but also, if one person calls me sir,
585940	587360	that's gonna ruin my day.
587360	589920	So I'm desperately throwing glitter spaghetti at the wall
589920	592720	in hopes the light catches some glimmer of womanhood.
592720	594600	I think butch or gender non-conforming cis women,
594600	597660	sometimes side-eye hyper-feminine trans women,
597660	599380	because they don't identify with this vision
599380	601780	of womanhood at all, and they've had to struggle
601780	604540	since childhood against a society that's told them
604540	605840	they have to be feminine.
605840	607800	And I completely sympathize with that.
607800	609720	I think there should be more gender freedom,
609720	611600	less coercion, less restriction.
611600	614960	But also, I have had to fight against the same society
614960	618540	that told me I should really, really, really not be this.
618540	620940	So, I feel like we should be able to form
620940	622700	some kind of solidarity here.
622700	623540	What, what, what?
624600	626380	Sorry, abolish gender.
626380	628780	But you should be moving beyond the patriarchal constructs
628780	631700	of masculinity and femininity, not conforming to them.
631700	635700	Real feminism aims to abolish gender, not reinforce it.
635700	637040	Abolish gender?
637040	639260	Well, that sounds like an ambitious project
639260	643320	for one transsexual, but I mean, I'll give it a try.
643320	644880	Solanus be praised.
644880	646820	No nails, no makeup.
646820	649580	I'm wearing a nice little gender-neutral robe moment.
649580	650800	I did it, everyone.
650800	652440	I abolished gender.
652440	654580	Well, I guess long hair is still a gender signifier.
654600	656900	So, I should probably get rid of that.
656900	659440	How is she though?
659440	661940	She's feeling a little genderless.
661940	664060	I guess the way I position my body is still gendered
664060	666320	and there's a gendered cadence to my voice.
666320	668980	So, what I'm gonna do is just hold my hands up genderlessly
668980	671060	and speak in a genderless robot voice.
671060	674500	My name is 5-4-6-6-4-1-7.
674500	676080	I have no gender.
676080	678160	Patriarchy is over.
678160	680640	I guess English is still a patriarchal language, right?
680640	681940	So, I should probably be communicating
681940	683280	with a series of genderless sounds.
683280	684100	Meow, meow.
684600	686820	Meow, meow, meow, meow, I can't stand this.
686820	687420	Fuck this.
687420	690040	Look, maybe abolishing gender is a good idea.
690040	692780	Like, wouldn't it be better if your genitals at birth
692780	695000	didn't determine what kind of life you could live?
695000	698620	But that is a utopian project requiring massive systemic change,
698620	700220	kind of like abolish borders.
700220	702680	Your utopian pipe dream is valid.
702680	704880	And denying trans people their gender identity
704880	708320	because abolish gender is kind of like denying citizenship
708320	710480	to immigrants because abolish borders.
710480	711820	Like, you're targeting the people
711820	714600	who are the most vulnerable under the present system, and then,
714600	716520	leveraging that system against them
716520	718260	under the pretense of abolishing it.
718260	719980	You know, you don't see gender-critical feminists
719980	722220	in Kim Kardashian's Instagram comments, like,
722220	725160	why are you wearing a dress, Kim, you creepy misogynist?
725160	726420	You should be abolishing gender,
726420	729220	not reinforcing stereotypes designed to oppress women.
729220	731300	No, they don't attack the gender expression
731300	733040	of people with power and influence.
733040	735020	They're all on Twitter harassing some poor,
735020	737280	newly-out trans woman with 200 followers,
737280	738820	and calling her a creepy man,
738820	740840	and mocking her for being feminine ineptly,
740840	743820	or being too feminine, or not being feminine enough.
744600	746160	Like, when they say abolish gender,
746160	748760	what they really mean is abolish trans people.
748760	751000	It's almost like this is a hate movement
751000	753880	hiding behind a handful of pseudo-feminist platitudes.
753880	756380	But surely, I must be missing something.
757760	760360	Concern four, male privilege.
760360	763540	It is absolutely typical of male privilege and entitlement
763540	766100	that you think you can just claim womanhood for yourself
766100	768620	without living any of the struggle that entails.
768620	772180	So look, I'm a successful, white, middle-class trans woman.
772180	773620	In the grand scheme of things,
773620	775460	I'm really not very oppressed.
775460	778960	I may not be the 1%, but I am the tranny 1%.
778960	780020	So I don't like to complain
780020	782060	about every little micro-aggression I experience,
782060	784720	because under the circumstances,
784720	786540	it just seems a little gauche.
786540	788680	And I don't like things that are gauche.
788680	791060	But I've had cis feminists of my race and class
791060	793080	tell me that I have no idea what it's like
793080	794980	to be talked over and interrupted by men.
794980	797280	Actually, Kropotkin.
797280	799040	Or to experience street harassment,
799040	800580	or to have to treat every first date
800580	802740	like a potentially life-threatening situation.
802740	805900	And it's just bizarre to me that they think that.
805900	808340	Like, what do you think my experience in the world is?
808340	810320	You think men treat me as their equal?
810320	812100	You think street harassers are gonna treat me
812100	815100	with dignity and respect because I have a Y chromosome?
815100	817340	Hey, beautiful, where you going, baby?
817340	818260	Where you going?
818260	819360	Oh, it's tranny.
819360	821200	Excuse me, sir, my mistake.
821200	824440	Please proceed freely to your destination.
824440	826500	Come on, people, use your heads.
826500	829060	When you have Jermaine Greer calling trans women it,
829060	829900	what do you think the guy
829900	831700	in the steps of the liquor store is gonna say?
831700	832580	When a trans woman doesn't pass,
832580	835900	it's not like society simply treats her like a man.
835900	838000	No, you get treated as monster gender,
838000	839740	pronouns it and spit,
839740	841700	and male privilege is not a good description
841700	843260	of that experience at all.
843260	844620	Once you start passing as a woman,
844620	846040	it's really a step up,
846040	847840	even though women get treated bad,
847840	851260	because it's still better to be a she than an it.
851260	853580	Now, gender-critical feminists are really skeptical
853580	855080	of the whole notion of passing.
855080	856960	They think they can always clock a tran,
856960	858900	and they assume everyone else can too.
858900	860900	But that's just not reality.
860900	862240	I mean, I'm only a year and a half
862240	863480	into my transition,
863480	865560	and at this point I've had zero surgeries,
865560	867400	and it's been like six months
867400	869320	since I was last misgendered offline.
869320	870820	I mean, a person with a good eye for it
870820	872060	will probably clock me,
872060	874640	and maybe a lot of people have just been indoctrinated
874640	876540	into politically correct gender ideology,
876540	879160	but like, you really think the gas station attendant
879160	881700	and the nail technicians and the heating and plumbing guy
881700	883300	are all calling me miss and ma'am
883300	885760	because of post-modernism?
885760	887060	I know some of you are gonna sneak off
887060	888780	to your shitty little radfem forums
888780	891360	and obsess over how manly and clockable I am, but like,
891360	892080	at the end of the day, I'm a woman.
892080	893840	At the end of the day, what am I gonna trust?
893840	896560	The deranged hate posting of 25 frothing anons,
896560	899860	or every social interaction I've had for months?
899860	902320	I'm so sorry you can't handle that I'm natural fish.
902320	904580	I'm ahi tuna, and you're mackerel sweaty.
904580	906180	Take a fuckin' sip, babes.
909320	910160	I love that.
911820	914340	Concern five, male socialization.
914340	915700	So you had a male upbringing,
915700	917900	you never experienced the traumas of girlhood,
917900	920000	you benefited from male privilege for decades,
920000	921580	and now you think none of that matters?
922080	923840	You are because of how you were socialized,
923840	925400	not because of how you dress.
925400	928000	All right, it's time to crack open the nuance.
930920	933020	So on the one hand, you're partially right.
933020	935060	I have no idea what it's like to be catcalled
935060	936060	as a nine-year-old girl,
936060	937760	or what that does to a child's psyche.
937760	939380	That kind of thing didn't start happening to me
939380	940360	till I was an adult,
940360	942520	when I knew what I was getting into and was ready for it.
942520	944860	That's very different from what cis women go through.
944860	947140	My upbringing in adolescence has more in common
947140	949040	with a typical man than a typical woman,
949040	951200	and many of my experiences from those days,
951200	954460	I simply can't make sense of as female experiences.
954460	956720	I absolutely benefited from male privilege,
956720	958580	and it did influence who I was.
958580	961000	And who I was in my late teens and early 20s
961000	962620	was an anti-feminist shithead
962620	964440	who had no idea what women go through.
964440	966640	And I feel ashamed and alone in admitting that,
966640	967880	because in trans discourse,
967880	970620	it's just accepted as obvious that trans men
970620	972440	know what it's like to be raised as women,
972440	975340	and to be influenced by those formative female experiences.
975340	977060	But when it comes to the early life experiences
977060	978760	of trans women, we're supposed to say,
978760	981080	"'When I was five years old, I loved wearing my mom's high
981080	983220	heels,' or else say nothing at all."
983220	985640	There's that wonderful quotation from Sylvia Plath,
985640	987500	where she describes the way living as a woman
987500	989480	stifles an adventurous spirit
989480	991660	and her longing for a male experience.
991660	995960	Yes, my consuming desires to mingle with road crews,
995960	999140	sailors and soldiers, barroom regulars,
999140	1003960	to be part of a scene, anonymous, listening, recording.
1003960	1008280	All this is spoilt by the fact that I am a girl,
1008280	1011080	a female, always supposedly in danger,
1011080	1013040	of assault and battery.
1013040	1015960	My consuming interest in men and their lives
1015960	1020000	is often misconstrued as a desire to seduce them,
1020000	1022540	or as an invitation to intimacy.
1022540	1026940	Yes, God, I want to talk to everybody as deeply as I can.
1026940	1029600	I want to be able to sleep in an open field,
1029600	1033220	to travel west, to walk freely at night."
1033220	1035840	So I got to do all of that in my early twenties.
1035840	1039040	And what I discovered is I hate sleeping in open fields.
1039040	1040500	I despise the West.
1040500	1042780	And I'd really rather stay inside,
1042780	1044820	collecting ceramics and sucking dick.
1044820	1046380	Now I'm not saying that makes me a woman.
1046380	1048420	And I'm not saying that Sylvia Plath is a man
1048420	1051020	because she wanted to slam back brewskis with road crews
1051020	1053000	for reasons that are inconceivable to me.
1053000	1055720	What I am saying is that when I hit my mid-twenties,
1055720	1058400	I realized that I was inhabiting a gender, body,
1058400	1061420	and sexual persona that were drastically wrong for me.
1061420	1063920	And I tried every possible alternative to transitioning
1063920	1066260	before realizing that I had an irrepressible need
1066260	1067200	to become a woman.
1067200	1068700	So I changed.
1068700	1069760	And when I changed,
1069760	1071580	society's treatment of me changed.
1071580	1073760	Socialization doesn't end with childhood.
1073760	1075320	It's a lifelong process.
1075320	1077140	For example, when I transitioned,
1077140	1079900	my friends, family, fans, enemies, stalkers,
1079900	1082360	and radical feminist haters started commenting
1082360	1085780	on my physical appearance about 20 to 30 times more often.
1085780	1087460	And I had to get used to that being something
1087460	1088780	that matters a lot more.
1088780	1091400	That said, resocialization takes time.
1091400	1094100	And sometimes trans people who are early in transition
1094100	1095860	have most of that process ahead of them.
1095860	1097540	I also think we have to take into account
1097540	1099640	the age at which a person transitions.
1099760	1101480	I'm Petrus, whomst we stan.
1101480	1102320	Oh, we stan.
1102320	1103160	We stan.
1103160	1104000	Oh, we stan.
1104000	1104820	I stan.
1104820	1105660	Oh, we stan.
1105660	1106720	She transitioned as a child,
1106720	1108700	and I imagine was socialized more or less
1108700	1109820	the same as a cis woman.
1109820	1112400	Whereas, Caitlyn Jenner, whomst, well,
1113980	1114820	just whomst.
1114820	1116680	She made millions of dollars in men's sports.
1116680	1118540	She had six children by three wives.
1118540	1121000	She transitioned in retirement at age 65
1121000	1123620	and told Buzzfeed that the hardest part of being a woman
1123620	1125580	is figuring out what to wear.
1126580	1129180	This is the only trans woman most people have heard of.
1129180	1130200	It makes me want to cry.
1130200	1132400	Like, I'm not saying that Caitlyn Jenner isn't a woman,
1132400	1134280	but I am saying that anyone who wants to argue
1134280	1136600	that male privilege hasn't shaped her perspective
1136600	1138100	doesn't have a leg to stand on.
1138100	1141140	But also, trans women often don't experience
1141140	1143300	male socialization the way cis men do.
1143300	1145080	Many trans women are feminine and queer
1145080	1147440	before they transition and have always experienced
1147440	1149900	a kind of femphobia that is rooted in misogyny.
1149900	1151840	Some trans women also identified as women
1151840	1154220	years before transitioning and internalized
1154220	1155940	society's messaging about women
1155940	1158040	more than society's messaging about men.
1158040	1159180	Now, that's still not the same
1159180	1161440	as living in society as a girl from birth,
1161440	1162840	but it's also pretty different
1162840	1165000	from the socialization of most cis men.
1165000	1167300	I think the reason some trans women feel the need to argue
1167300	1169920	that trans women never experience male privilege
1169920	1172340	is that a lot of TERFs use male privilege
1172340	1174660	as a proxy for calling us men.
1174660	1175700	Pull up your zipper.
1175700	1178180	Your male privilege is hanging out.
1178180	1180820	I suspect the reason this is such a major talking point
1180820	1182620	for many gender-critical feminists
1182620	1185180	is that there's an element here of stolen valor,
1185180	1187580	the sense of injustice that people are claiming
1187580	1189160	their identity without experiencing it.
1189180	1192180	It reminds me of what in the trans community
1192180	1194180	are called transmedicalists,
1194180	1196560	people who insist the only real trans people
1196560	1198900	are those who experience agonizing dysphoria.
1198900	1201560	In both cases, there's a sense that the essential thing
1201560	1204120	that confirms your identity is pain.
1204120	1207020	What it is to be trans is to despise your body.
1207020	1210080	What it is to be a woman is to be brutalized by men.
1210080	1212120	You didn't suffer like I've suffered.
1212120	1213740	You don't know what it's like.
1213740	1215240	You know, I'm tempted to strike back
1215240	1217200	by saying that you don't know what it's like
1217200	1218500	to occupy an identity so stigmatized
1218500	1219040	that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity so stigmatized
1219040	1219540	that you don't know what it's like to occupy an identity so stigmatized
1219540	1222040	that most of the people who are attracted to you in private
1222040	1224040	are too ashamed to admit it in public.
1224040	1226440	You don't know what it's like to have a body so non-normative
1226440	1228700	that you're shut out of whole areas of society.
1228700	1232060	I could go on, but this America's Next Top Victim contest
1232060	1233840	does nothing but to provoke infighting
1233840	1235640	between trans women and cis women
1235640	1238020	at a time when we should be marching side-by-side
1238020	1239800	to destroy video games forever.
1239800	1241560	Hashtag yes all gamers.
1242720	1245440	Concerned sex, reproductive oppression.
1245440	1246740	You don't know what it's like
1246740	1248360	to grow up being shamed for your periods,
1248360	1250040	to fear unwanted pregnancy,
1250040	1252040	to have to fight for your right to abortion,
1252040	1254280	to bear the pain of childbirth.
1254280	1257400	Well, yeah, that's true.
1257400	1260840	My inner Rad Femme sways in a gentle, victorious samba.
1260840	1262680	I do think it's important for trans women
1262680	1264520	to stand in solidarity with cis women
1264520	1267000	on issues like period equity and abortion rights,
1267000	1268840	and to learn about the experiences of cis women
1268840	1270440	to form a more complete understanding
1270440	1271640	of the female condition.
1271640	1274120	But of course, no individual woman experiences
1274120	1275880	all the things women experience,
1275880	1278360	and individual women understand the meaning of womanhood.
1278360	1279880	In drastically different ways.
1279880	1281320	For some women, having babies
1281320	1283480	is the most essentially womanly experience.
1283480	1285800	For others, maybe it's having an abortion.
1285800	1287720	I mean, not actually, but you know,
1287720	1289640	TERFs pretend it is to own the trannies.
1289640	1292040	For me, it's receiving 12-paragraph emails
1292040	1294040	in my business inbox from married men
1294040	1295800	struggling through the existential crisis
1295800	1298760	of some kind of shemale-themed sexual awakening.
1298760	1300120	Also, do you wanna be a guest
1300120	1302440	on my podcast, Free Speech Radio?
1302440	1305000	But also, not all women experience their womanhood
1305000	1306360	as essentially oppressive,
1306360	1308280	or centered around the pain of reproductive health.
1308360	1309320	And that's not the only reason
1309320	1310760	I'm not talking about the gender gap.
1310760	1311480	I'm talking about the gender gap
1311480	1312600	in the capacity of men.
1312600	1313480	When Shania Twain sang,
1313480	1314440	Man, I Feel Like a Woman,
1314440	1316680	she wasn't talking about having a coat hanger abortion
1316680	1319320	in the bathroom of a Greyhound station in Chattanooga.
1319320	1321560	Man, I feel like shit.
1323720	1326840	Concern seven, erasing female vocabulary.
1326840	1329720	Trans activists are erasing the vocabulary needed
1329720	1331880	to discuss women's bodies and women's oppression.
1331880	1334200	We are now expected to talk about pregnant people
1334200	1337480	and menstruators just to appease the gender ideologues.
1337480	1338840	I'm a menstruator.
1338840	1341640	I am a W-O-M-B-Y-N,
1341640	1344040	and I will not be erased.
1344920	1348200	Okay, if you've heard the terms menstruator or pregnant people
1348200	1348920	and are thinking,
1348920	1351160	what the fuck kind of Orwellian newspeak
1351160	1352920	gender cuckoldry is that?
1352920	1356040	Take a deep breath, clear your mind, here's the tea.
1356040	1358600	Some medical organizations have recently begun using the term
1358600	1360840	pregnant people instead of pregnant women.
1360840	1364280	And in 2016, Planned Parenthood included the word menstruators
1364280	1366600	in a tweet about the repeal of a tampon tax.
1366600	1369960	This prompted some conservative TERF and Christian publications
1369960	1374520	to post panicked commentaries warning that the entire concept of womanhood is being erased.
1374520	1378840	But in fact, medical language that assumes that everyone with a uterus is a woman
1378840	1382760	erases trans men or non-binary people who menstruate and get pregnant.
1382760	1385800	So saying pregnant women in this context erases them,
1385800	1389000	whereas saying pregnant people includes them and cis women
1389000	1390280	and doesn't erase anyone.
1390280	1390920	Except for...
1390920	1393720	...Cincinnatians, because we all know they're not people.
1393720	1395960	Take your shitty chili elsewhere, but I'm a woman,
1395960	1397480	not a goddamn menstruator.
1397480	1401720	What kind of misogynistic madness is it to reduce women to their capacity to bleed?
1401720	1405640	I actually agree with you that the word menstruator sounds pretty dehumanizing,
1405640	1409000	and the trans men I've talked to about this aren't the biggest fans of it either.
1409000	1413240	Sometimes it takes a while to settle on language that's both inclusive and usable,
1413240	1416840	and my prediction is that menstruators is not gonna work out.
1416840	1418520	Maybe people who menstruate?
1418520	1420200	But why can't I just say woman?
1420200	1422280	That's what I am.
1422280	1424040	You can't just say woman.
1424040	1425480	That is what you are.
1425960	1428680	I'm just asking that you stop referring to yourself as a woman.
1428680	1433080	Institutional medical language is designed to be inclusive and therefore impersonal.
1433080	1438040	No one is proposing that we stop calling individual women pregnant women or expectant mothers.
1438040	1441000	Your obvious misogyny is nakedly exposed.
1441000	1443960	I notice it's only female anatomy you're trying to erase.
1443960	1447800	I notice you're not suggesting doctors start saying people with prostates.
1447800	1450200	Though I am definitely suggesting that.
1450200	1455480	But trans activists are invading feminist spaces and telling women we can't discuss our own bodies.
1455480	1459640	I have no problem with cis feminists discussing or celebrating periods
1459640	1464280	or wearing pussy hats at political marches or free bleeding all over the National Mall.
1464280	1465480	I mean, someone has to.
1465480	1468040	The National Mall is not gonna bleed on itself.
1468040	1472120	I totally get why cis feminists would want to celebrate their reproductive anatomy
1472120	1476200	in defiance of a society that routinely shames and subjugates them for it.
1476200	1481320	The problem arises only when menstruation or reproductive anatomy are used to misgender trans men
1481320	1483720	or exclude wombs whom doth not bleed.
1483720	1485320	I mean, trans women do bleed.
1485320	1487560	But only when we cut ourselves.
1487560	1493640	No one knows what it's like to be a sad tran.
1494760	1496200	Concern 8.
1496200	1497480	TERF is a slur.
1498040	1501080	TERF is a slur designed to silence women.
1501080	1504680	Nay, it is hate speech designed to incite violence against women.
1504680	1509560	The word TERF is a pejorative for a person who dresses up transphobia with radical feminism.
1509560	1511000	But it's not a slur.
1511000	1515240	A slur is a pejorative that targets someone's race, religion, gender, or sexuality.
1515720	1519560	The word misogynist is pejorative, it has only negative connotations,
1519560	1522440	and is often used as an insult, but it's not a slur.
1522440	1525880	It targets bigoted behavior and beliefs, not a type of person.
1525880	1527720	The same is true of the word TERF.
1527720	1532440	It's a derogatory term for beliefs and behaviors that deserve to be derogated.
1532440	1535320	The term gender critical is really a euphemism,
1535320	1540200	recently created to replace TERF with a phrase that doesn't have such negative connotations.
1540200	1543080	It's perfectly analogous to the phrase race realist,
1543080	1545080	which was invented by racists wanting a
1545080	1547960	more flattering and respectable description of their beliefs.
1547960	1552200	I've used the term gender critical in this video to be inviting to fence-sitters,
1552200	1556360	but I refuse to cooperate with racists who want me to use their euphemisms,
1556360	1558840	and I generally do the same with TERFs.
1558840	1561960	Now, I'm a very agreeable, non-confrontational person.
1561960	1564760	I usually like to call people by whatever they want to be called.
1564760	1567400	But when it comes to race realist or gender critical,
1568040	1569560	every time I use these phrases,
1569560	1573720	I'm essentially becoming an accomplice in their scheme to legitimize bigotry.
1573720	1575000	And I have especially...
1575000	1578760	little patience for TERF requests for linguistic decorum,
1578760	1584200	since most of the language used by TERFs is specifically designed to be maximally hurtful,
1584200	1586600	harmful, and insulting to trans people.
1586600	1591800	For instance, TERFs refer to any and all trans-related surgery as mutilation.
1591800	1596280	They call trans women TIMs, an acronym for trans-identified males,
1596280	1599720	and trans men TIFs, trans-identified females,
1599720	1602760	obviously with the intent of mockery and misgendering.
1602760	1604760	Just to give you a sample of typical TERF
1604760	1608440	prose, here are a couple comments from literally the first thread I saw
1608440	1611480	on the Gender Critical subreddit while I was working on this video.
1611480	1615160	And I have to admit to considerably more contempt for the likes of
1616120	1620440	since he makes a point of taking selfies with ridiculous,
1620440	1622600	insulting-to-women facial expressions.
1623320	1627800	I also get a good laugh at TIMs putting their hands up to their chins.
1627800	1631480	They're trying to look all dainty and to hide their Adam's apple,
1631480	1633960	but it only draws more attention to their
1633960	1634680	ENORMAL
1634760	1635960	MISS MAN hands.
1635960	1640200	I saw an AGP photoshoot with this neanderthal in his 50s,
1640200	1643320	was posing with one leg up like a flamingo,
1643320	1645320	his hands dainty at his ear,
1646040	1647960	in every photo,
1647960	1649800	even group ones at events.
1650520	1654120	Now I was just grossed out.
1654120	1655160	So there it is.
1655160	1656680	That's what this is really about.
1656680	1659800	In this video, I've gone through a list of gender critical concerns,
1659800	1663000	and I've provided responses I hope the average person will find fair.
1663000	1664680	But I would be lying to you by omission,
1664680	1667720	if I were to end this video without being real with you
1667720	1672040	about what the core of the gender critical movement is actually about.
1672040	1675320	See what TERFs do in public is advance what, on the surface,
1675320	1677880	are a series of feminist critiques of trans people.
1677880	1680440	For example, the critique that hyperfeminine trans women
1680440	1683960	are reinforcing misogynistic stereotypes designed to oppress women.
1683960	1688680	At a glance, this appears to be a critique of the way some trans women behave and present themselves.
1688680	1693720	But in the next breath, these same TERFs will argue that trans women are mannish, unfeminine perverts
1693720	1694520	who are forcing masturbation on them.
1694520	1698760	So if trans women being feminine is bad,
1698760	1701000	and trans women being masculine is bad,
1701000	1705320	then there really is no way that trans women could behave that TERFs would accept.
1705320	1709240	So in fact, what TERFs really oppose is not trans women being feminine,
1709240	1711080	or trans women being masculine,
1711080	1713720	but trans women being trans women.
1713720	1719400	In other words, the fundamental issue underlying all these phony concerns is transphobia.
1719400	1722920	Simple animosity towards trans people's very existence.
1722920	1724440	And it's pretty easy to recognize,
1724440	1727240	just from the tone they use when they talk about us.
1727240	1730280	When you read through the gender-critical subreddit or TERF Twitter,
1730280	1734280	what you see is just the flimsiest cloak of feminist platitudes
1734280	1739240	draped over a jagged thorn tangle of visceral disgust and targeted hate.
1739240	1744120	The pure, exuberant malice of it all is not even disguised in the Germaine Greer quote
1744120	1748040	from the opening of this video, or in the average gender-critical forum post.
1748040	1751640	The enormous, knuckly, hairy, beringed paw.
1751640	1754120	The pancake makeup through which the stubble,
1754440	1755880	was already burgeoning.
1755880	1758200	This Neanderthal in his fifties.
1758200	1761560	Ridiculous, insulting to women facial expressions.
1761560	1763800	Now I was just grossed out.
1763800	1769640	What gender-critical feminism really amounts to is a baroque palace of rationalizations
1769640	1773080	built on a foundation of pure disgust.
1773080	1775640	In this respect, it's just like homophobia.
1775640	1779240	You know, I came of age when gay marriage was the most contentious social debate,
1779240	1780840	and the arguments people made,
1780840	1782280	that marriage was under attack,
1782280	1784040	that the children would be traumatized,
1784040	1785880	that bestiality would be next,
1785880	1790200	that this tiny minority was undermining all our institutions with their outrageous demands,
1790200	1792360	it was all just nonsense.
1792360	1795800	If you got a conservative drunk, as I used to be able to do,
1795800	1797880	Sylvia, I wish I could give you what I had,
1797880	1799480	he would just blurt out the truth,
1799480	1804360	which was that the sight of two grown men locking lips made him wanna vom.
1804360	1808440	Homophobia and transphobia do not originate in the frontal cortex.
1808440	1812600	They come from the lizard brain disgust response we evolved to deal with blood,
1812600	1813800	infection, vomit, fear.
1813800	1816360	It's a disgust I can recognize at a glance,
1816360	1819960	because it's the same disgust I felt toward myself for years.
1819960	1825160	It's the disgust I felt when I clocked a trans woman on the L platform in Chicago five years ago,
1825160	1828760	and decided then and there to abandon my first attempt at transition.
1828760	1831880	It's the disgust I still struggle against every day.
1831880	1834920	It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,
1834920	1839240	because transphobia is the only thing that's ever going to stop you from moving forward.
1839240	1841640	It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,
1841640	1843640	because transphobia is the only thing that's ever going to stop you from moving forward.
1843800	1844360	It's the disgust that's always at the bottom of transphobia,
1844360	1845640	because transphobia is always the same.
1845640	1850360	It always comes from the same place, and it's always expressed in the same kinds of ways.
1850360	1854600	I recently rewatched that classic viral video from an old episode of Cops,
1854600	1859240	where a police officer humiliates a Native American trans woman named Stephanie Yellowhair.
1859240	1862840	The power-tripping cop demands to see her ID, misgenders her,
1862840	1866760	deadnames her, mocks her clothes and makeup, and calls her a cross-dresser.
1866760	1868920	It's all so repetitive and familiar.
1868920	1872920	It's the same arsenal of petty sadism you see in the right-wing press,
1872920	1878200	on 4chan, on doxxing forums, on gender-critical Reddit, it's all the same.
1878200	1880600	What everyone remembers about Stephanie Yellowhair
1880600	1884440	is her unbreakable wit and confidence in the face of transphobic abuse.
1884440	1886760	The single most iconic moment is when,
1886760	1891160	after being grilled in the back of the cop car amid a flurry of deadnaming and misgendering,
1891160	1893320	she glances back at the cop and says,
1893320	1895080	Excuse my beauty.
1895080	1896120	Excuse your beauty.
1896120	1896760	Okay.
1896760	1902040	And that, right there, is the single greatest quality of transfeminine culture,
1902040	1906440	the resilience of trans women, the assumption of a regal posture,
1906440	1908840	and even the most abject conditions.
1908840	1914200	And that's really all you can do, because there's just no reasoning a transphobe out of bigotry.
1914200	1918200	So, to any die-hard gender-critical feminists still watching this,
1918200	1921880	what else can I say except, on behalf of all trans women,
1921880	1923000	excuse my beauty,
1923720	1924520	TERF.
1932040	1962040	
1962040	1965040	Tongue pop is not the solution to every problem.
1965040	1965880	Or is it?
1965880	1967220	I posted an invitation to Twitter
1967220	1970280	for people who used to be gender-critical feminists
1970280	1972080	to chew me in the back of the head.
1974480	1976440	It's PC run AMAC.
1979860	1980700	AMAC.
1982480	1983320	Look at it.
1983320	1984160	Okay.
1984160	1985000	It's so stupid.
1985000	1987320	It's so stupid.
1987320	1988540	Run AMAC.
1988540	1990380	Corona Premier.
1990380	1991220	See?
1991220	1992880	Turf beer of choice.
1992880	1994480	My chromosomes need to unwind
1994480	1996660	after a hard day of hating trans people.
1999600	2000820	It is absa...
2000820	2001660	These titties.
2001660	2003320	I just saw them and I just lost it.
2003320	2004160	I just...
2004160	2005000	It's just...
2005000	2006020	What?
2006020	2008560	I-M-A-W-M-B-Y-N.
2008560	2011320	You do know how I struggle with spelling.
2011320	2013160	V-I-Z-T-R-O-Y.
2016200	2019040	No one knows what it's like
2019040	2020260	to be a sad,
2020260	2021680	trian,
2021680	2024140	to be a trashcan
2024140	2025500	for trap chasers,
2025500	2026340	jizz.
