0	20460	Okay. Let's get started. I literally need a man. I need a man. Help! Alright, I'm gonna
20460	29520	get pliers. The lesbian solution. Okay. Let's get started.
38740	43200	I love my king. This is not really the most feminine moment for me. Not really my
43200	48080	2020 vibe, but it does proportionize my giant man hands.
48360	49840	Meow, meow, meow.
49840	54000	Alright, no one thinks I'm cute. Let's get started. Okay, look, this video is about
54000	60140	canceling, also known as cancel culture, formerly known as call-out culture. And I know you kids
60140	65920	know all about this, but before we dive in, I have to explain the basics to my fellow boomers.
66160	71800	So listen up, oldies. In the lingo of these young, avocado-guzzling, smartphone addicts
71800	78320	who killed Applebee's, canceling is online shaming, vilifying, and ostracizing of prominent
78320	79780	members of a community by
79780	84020	other members of that community. Like so much internet slang, this use of the word
84020	90620	canceling started out on black Twitter, where a few years ago, people, well, mostly women,
90940	95220	would tweet, cancel R. Kelly, and things like that. You know, it started out as this vigilante
95220	100560	strategy for bringing justice and accountability to powerful people who previously had been
100560	102860	immune to any consequences for their actions.
103200	109340	For example, the Me Too movement promised to use social media shaming to topple sexually abusive men in power,
109780	116580	who couldn't be held accountable any other way. The promise of canceling was that it was going to give power back to people who had none,
116580	124920	and bring justice to prominent abusers. It's in a way, the 21st century version of the guillotine, the bringer of justice, the people's avenger.
124920	137320	But also like the guillotine, it can become a sadistic entertainment spectacle. And I want to make the case that we do have, well, a teensy bit of a Reign of Terror situation on our hands, Gorg.
137320	141520	Now, there's a version of this conversation that's already been had to death, and it goes like this.
141620	147040	On the one side are a bunch of male comedians who constantly bitch about how cancel culture is out of control.
147300	151560	You can't joke about anything anymore without these millennial jackals trying to get you in trouble.
151560	157180	And the other side is mostly progressive think piece authors who argue that there's no such thing as cancel culture,
157520	162580	it's just that powerful people are finally being held accountable for their actions, and they can't fucking handle it,
162600	166900	so they go around bitching about cancel culture. Now, unfortunately, neither of those viewpoints,
167320	172820	is quite as correct as some people might hope. So it's a good thing I'm here to deliver the truth.
172820	174820	He didn't know I was transgender.
174820	176820	Story time. Emotional, not clickbait.
176820	182820	Let's start with an example. The most high-profile YouTube canceling of 2019 was the canceling of James Charles.
182820	188320	And again, I know you kids remember this, but I have to reheat ancient YouTube tea for the elders.
188320	190320	Put the kettle on, Karen.
190320	195320	So James Charles is a 20-year-old beauty guru, which means, um, boomers.
195320	197320	Look, there's these people,
197320	199320	who make YouTube videos,
199320	201320	teaching you how to do makeup.
201320	205320	It's worth checking out if you can figure out how to start up Internet Explorer.
205320	207320	I certainly can't.
207320	209320	It's pretty bomb. It's lit. It's, uh,
209320	211320	it's groovy. It's fab. It's far out, man.
211320	213320	It's a gas. I fully dig it.
213320	215320	Free love. Give peace a chance.
215320	217320	Nixon's a fascist.
217320	219320	So back in May of this year, James's colleague and
219320	221320	mother figure?
221320	224320	Fellow YouTube beauty guru Tati Westbrook
224320	226320	uploaded a 40-minute video
226320	229320	accusing James of endorsing
229320	231320	a different brand of hair vitamins
231320	234320	than the brand that she,
234320	237320	wait, that was a competitor of her brand of hair vitamins.
237320	240320	An enthralling plotline, I know.
240320	243320	And this was huge. This was covered in the New York Times.
243320	245320	And while Tati was at it,
245320	247320	almost as an afterthought to the, uh,
247320	249320	hair vitamin dispute,
249320	251320	she also accused James of being
251320	254320	a sexual predator.
254320	256320	Now, I actually went back and checked
256320	258320	Tati's original deleted video,
258320	261320	and she actually never uses the phrase
261320	262320	sexual predator.
262320	264320	It's funny, I remember her calling him that
264320	267320	because that became the story on Twitter.
267320	269320	But what she actually said was
269320	272320	James had tried to trick straight men
272320	274320	into thinking they're gay.
274320	276320	Oh my god, you tried to trick a straight man
276320	279320	into thinking he's gay yet again.
279320	283320	Which is pretty different from calling him a sexual predator.
283320	285320	But see, this is what cancel culture does.
285320	288320	It takes one story and transforms it
288320	291320	into a significantly different story.
291320	293320	You know, the headline I would write
293320	295320	about the James and Tati story might read
295320	298320	Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles
298320	300320	of trying to trick straight men
300320	302320	into thinking they're gay.
302320	304320	But cancel culture transforms that story
304320	306320	into the headline,
306320	309320	James Charles is a sexual predator.
309320	311320	Interesting.
311320	313320	Now, I want to make it clear that my intention here
313320	315320	is really not to defend James Charles.
315320	317320	I'm not a James Charles stan.
317320	320320	I'm a biological female in my 30s.
320320	321320	Close to death, I know.
321320	323320	Please leave a comment before I die.
323320	326320	That said, I do think the statement
326320	328320	James Charles is a sexual predator
328320	330320	is a stretch, to say the least.
330320	332320	At least, based on the information I have
332320	334320	in December 2019.
334320	337320	So let's analyze how this kind of truth stretching happens.
337320	338320	Cancel culture trope one.
338320	340320	And you should be writing this down, class,
340320	342320	because this will be on the test.
342320	344320	Cancel culture trope one.
344320	345320	Presumption of guilt.
345320	348320	There's a traditional understanding of justice
348320	349320	according to which,
349320	351320	before you condemn or punish a person,
351320	353320	you hear the accuser's side of the story
353320	356320	and the accused's side of the story.
356320	358320	You allow both sides to present evidence
358320	360320	and only after everyone involved
360320	362320	has had a chance to make their case
362320	365320	do you pass sentence and punish the convict.
365320	367320	Aww. Punish me, King.
367320	369320	Drinking this is punishment enough.
369320	371320	Am I uncanceled yet, please?
371320	373320	In the United States,
373320	375320	we legally have the presumption of innocence.
375320	378320	But canceling does not abide by the law.
378320	381320	Canceling is a form of vigilante mob justice.
381320	384320	And a lot of times, an accusation is proof enough.
384320	386320	Now, that's basically the point
386320	388320	of the progressive slogan,
388320	390320	believe victims.
390320	393320	It's a norm that was put into place in progressive spaces
393320	395320	because out in the world at large,
395320	397320	people generally don't believe victims.
397320	399320	But I think it's pretty obvious
399320	400320	how believe victims
400320	402320	is a norm that's easy to abuse.
402320	405320	Was Tati really James' victim?
405320	406320	No.
406320	408320	She's not some powerless woman
408320	410320	abused by a prominent man in her industry.
410320	412320	She's on top of the industry.
412320	415320	And she wasn't victimized by James at all.
415320	417320	I see this case more as she weaponized
417320	420320	cancel culture against a business rival.
420320	422320	Anyway, before James had even had a chance
422320	424320	to respond to Tati's accusation,
424320	426320	the story had already gone from
426320	428320	Tati Westbrook accuses James Charles
428320	430320	of trying to trick straight men
430320	433320	to James Charles tried to trick straight men.
433320	436320	And from there, it was generalized into
436320	438320	James Charles is toxic and manipulative.
438320	441320	Which brings us to cancel culture trope two,
441320	443320	abstraction.
443320	445320	Abstraction replaces the specific,
445320	447320	concrete details of a claim
447320	449320	with a more generic statement.
449320	451320	In the transition from Tati Westbrook
451320	454320	accused James Charles of trying to trick straight men
454320	457320	to James Charles is toxic and manipulative,
457320	460320	we've lost not only the sense of this behavior,
460320	462320	being an unverified accusation,
462320	465320	but we've also lost all the specific details.
465320	467320	James Charles is toxic and manipulative
467320	469320	is an incredibly vague statement.
469320	472320	It may as well be James Charles is bad.
472320	474320	But even without the presumption of guilt,
474320	477320	if someone tells me James Charles is accused
477320	479320	of toxic and manipulative behavior,
479320	482320	I'm gonna think, oh, that sounds pretty bad.
482320	484320	And I'm gonna start speculating about the specifics.
484320	486320	And whatever my imagination comes up with
486320	488320	is likely going to be worse
488320	489320	than whatever he's actually accused of.
489320	493320	Also, the specific accusation
493320	495320	that he tried to trick straight men
495320	497320	into thinking they're gay
497320	500320	is self-evidently kind of questionable.
500320	502320	How do you trick straight men into thinking they're gay?
502320	504320	If you find out, let me know.
504320	507320	It's bad. I'm bad. I'm super bad.
507320	509320	This is not a problem that straight men
509320	511320	usually seem to have.
511320	513320	At the very least, it requires further explanation.
513320	515320	It's the kind of story that sounds like
515320	517320	it has more than one side.
517320	519320	I'm not gonna be gonna feel a little bit skeptical
519320	520320	of the accusation.
520320	523320	And I'm also gonna side-eye Tati Westbrook
523320	526320	because this accusation is setting off
526320	528320	my homophobia detection alarm.
528320	530320	Leave the gays alone.
530320	532320	But I'm not gonna have an opportunity
532320	534320	to pick up on the potential homophobia
534320	536320	and be skeptical of it
536320	538320	if all I've heard about the situation
538320	540320	is James Charles is toxic and manipulative.
540320	542320	And I also wanna point out
542320	545320	a linguistic shift that's happening here.
545320	547320	When the claim was James Charles tried
547320	548320	to trick straight men,
548320	551320	the verbs in the sentence were try and trick.
551320	554320	So what we're criticizing here is James' behavior.
554320	557320	We're criticizing things he did, allegedly,
557320	559320	trying to trick straight men.
559320	561320	But once the claim morphs into James Charles
561320	563320	is toxic and manipulative,
563320	566320	the verb in the sentence is is, to be.
566320	569320	So these adjectives are characteristics of James,
569320	571320	and it's now not his actions we're criticizing
571320	574320	but his personality, his toxicity,
574320	576320	his manipulativeness.
576320	577320	And this is what I'll call
577320	580320	Cancel Culture Trope 3, essentialism.
580320	581320	Essentialism is when we go
581320	583320	from criticizing a person's actions
583320	586320	to criticizing the person themselves.
586320	588320	We're not just saying they did bad things,
588320	590320	we're saying they're a bad person.
590320	592320	And that's what takes us from
592320	594320	James Charles tried to trick straight men
594320	598320	to James Charles is a sexual predator.
598320	600320	So here we're targeting James himself,
600320	602320	not just his actions,
602320	604320	but the type of person he is.
604320	606320	A sexual predator.
606320	609320	And we've also really escalated the accusation.
609320	611320	Because I don't know about you guys,
611320	613320	but when I hear the phrase sexual predator,
613320	615320	the image that comes to mind is
615320	617320	a rapist or a child molester,
617320	619320	maybe an abusive boss?
619320	621320	Not a teenage twink hung up
621320	623320	on wanting to date straight guys.
623320	624320	I mean, not that a person like that
624320	626320	couldn't be a sexual predator,
626320	629320	but I really don't think that he's a sexual predator
629320	632320	is a fair summary of the accusation.
632320	634320	So this seems to me like a pretty nasty
634320	636320	and dishonest twisting of the story.
636320	638320	And it happened instantaneously on Twitter.
638320	640320	It totally dominated the conversation
640320	642320	in a community of millions of people
642320	644320	for weeks.
644320	645320	In a few days,
645320	647320	James had lost millions of subscribers,
647320	649320	and who knows what effect it had on his personal life.
649320	651320	Not that anyone seems to care.
651320	655320	In fact, most people seemed to be enjoying his downfall.
655320	657320	He was a teenage millionaire,
657320	659320	a young, beautiful superstar.
659320	661320	Easy to envy, easy to resent,
661320	664320	hard to relate to, hard to sympathize with.
664320	666320	What was the point of canceling James Charles?
666320	668320	Did we want to teach him a lesson?
668320	670320	Did we want him to learn from his mistakes
670320	672320	and grow as a person?
672320	674320	Imagine actually wanting someone to learn.
674320	676320	Imagine actually caring.
676320	679320	My hunch is that the average YouTube viewer
679320	681320	was not sincerely outraged and hurt
681320	683320	by their sincere belief that James Charles
683320	685320	was a sexual predator.
685320	688320	In other words, this was not a case of triggered SJWs.
688320	691320	This was a controversy manufactured from the top
691320	694320	by a handful of seemingly vindictive and envious people.
694320	696320	I honestly think that most of the
696320	698320	James Charles is a sexual predator crowd
698320	701320	just wanted to bring him down a peg.
701320	702320	Cancel culture trope four.
702320	705320	Pseudo-moralism or pseudo-intellectualism.
705320	707320	If you look at the world we live in,
707320	710320	would you say that people are usually motivated
710320	713320	by a sense of moral integrity and intellectual rigor?
713320	715320	No, maybe not.
715320	717320	Let's be real, America.
717320	720320	We are a bunch of morally impotent meatbags
720320	723320	constantly shitting ourselves out of fear and lust.
724320	727320	For Tati, calling out James, this was really,
727320	730320	it was about the hair vitamins, right?
730320	733320	I think sis was super salty that this millionaire kid
733320	735320	who she had supported and helped
735320	738320	had betrayed her by endorsing a rival brand.
738320	741320	And accusing him of trying to trick straight men
741320	743320	was just a twist of the knife.
743320	745320	But moralism or intellectualism
745320	748320	provide a phony pretext for the call out.
748320	751320	You can pretend you just want an apology.
751320	753320	You can pretend you're just a concerned citizen
753320	755320	who wants the person to improve.
755320	757320	You can pretend you're simply offering up criticism
757320	759320	when what you're really doing
759320	761320	is attacking a person's career and reputation
761320	763320	out of spite, envy, revenge.
763320	765320	I mean, it could be any motivation.
765320	767320	Twitter viewed James as an overprivileged,
767320	769320	spoiled little brat
769320	773320	and it was fun to wipe the smile off his smug face
773320	775320	at least for a few weeks.
775320	776320	It's schadenfreude, right?
776320	778320	This kind of petty sadism.
778320	780320	Maybe not the internet's proudest moment,
780320	782320	but not the most shameful either.
782320	784320	And it's not to say that everyone cancelling James Charles
784320	785320	was insincere.
785320	787320	But there's a world of difference
787320	789320	between Cancel R. Kelly
789320	791320	and Cancel James Charles.
791320	793320	And I'm interested to know
793320	796320	how these two things came to look the same.
796320	797320	When James was being cancelled,
797320	799320	I remember being kind of transfixed
799320	801320	by the sight of his life and career
801320	803320	falling from the sky,
803320	806320	full tailspin, black smoke spewing out.
806320	808320	And a lot of my YouTube friends were like,
808320	810320	lol, did you see James Charles is cancelled?
810320	811320	lolololololol.
811320	813320	But I looked up at James and I said,
813320	817320	oh god, that's gonna be me someday.
817320	819320	Stay strong, sister.
819320	821320	Don't let the bastards get you down.
823320	825320	Let's switch over to White Claw.
825320	827320	These are cute, these are fun.
827320	829320	A little more of a feminine moment for me.
829320	832320	They didn't even have these last time I was an alcoholic.
832320	834320	I'm not even wearing makeup.
834320	837320	I don't need makeup to serve a full biological fantasy.
839320	840320	Keep drinking, people.
840320	842320	We're gonna make it through this together.
842320	844320	So I was doing a little Twitter archaeology
844320	847320	when I was looking into the James Charles cancelling,
847320	849320	and I found a bunch of tweets
849320	852320	referencing earlier James Charles scandals.
852320	853320	Y'all forgiving James Charles?
853320	855320	He's still a transphobe.
855320	858320	Y'all are acting like just because James Charles has receipts,
858320	860320	he's no longer a racist transphobe.
860320	864320	Like, James Charles is racist, ableist, transphobic,
864320	866320	and a sexual predator.
866320	867320	A white woman.
867320	869320	Y'all are being too harsh on him and he's uncancelled.
869320	871320	So according to Twitter,
871320	874320	James Charles is not only a sexual predator,
874320	878320	he's also a racist and a transphobe.
878320	879320	That sounds pretty serious.
879320	881320	Let's investigate.
881320	883320	We'll start with the transphobia allocation.
883320	885320	Cockerels of the jury.
885320	886320	Exhibit A.
886320	887320	So you're not even full gay.
887320	889320	I mean, no, there have been girls in the past that I've, like,
889320	890320	thought were really, really beautiful.
890320	892320	There's also been, like, trans guys in the past, too,
892320	895320	that I was, like, really, really into for a moment in time.
895320	896320	And I oop.
896320	897320	As they say on Twitter,
897320	898320	yikes.
898320	899320	This ain't it, chief.
899320	902320	Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.
902320	904320	Maybe don't be transphobic.
904320	905320	Disappointing.
905320	908320	So James did, uh, fuck up here.
908320	912320	The problem is he's suggesting that being attracted to trans men
912320	914320	makes him less gay,
914320	917320	which implies that trans men aren't really men,
917320	920320	which is at odds with the way trans men understand themselves.
920320	922320	So this does deserve criticism.
922320	923320	No doubt, no doubt.
923320	926320	However, what I see when I look at this clip of James
926320	927320	is not
927320	930320	a dyed-in-the-wool transphobic bigot.
930320	932320	I see a very young person
932320	936320	who's still working on understanding his own sexuality
936320	938320	and is trying to figure out
938320	941320	where his attraction to trans men fits into that.
941320	945320	And it seems to me that the proportionate response to that situation
945320	948320	is for someone to take James aside
948320	949320	and explain to him,
949320	953320	look, here's why what you said is hurtful to trans men,
953320	956320	and here are some tips on how to avoid saying that kind of thing in the future.
956320	961320	You know, ignorance is not the same thing as hatred.
961320	965320	Not understanding someone is not the same as wanting them dead.
965320	967320	Of course, there are committed bigots
967320	969320	who it's just a waste of time to engage with.
969320	972320	But sometimes just talking to someone
972320	975320	with a little patience and understanding is all it takes.
975320	977320	But that's not what cancel culture does.
977320	981320	Oh no, we have to immediately escalate every situation
981320	984320	to the highest possible level of conflict.
984320	985320	So by abstraction,
985320	988320	we get James Charles made transphobic comments.
988320	990320	And by essentialism, we get
990320	993320	James Charles is a transphobe.
993320	995320	We don't give him a chance to reflect.
995320	997320	We don't give him an opportunity to learn.
997320	1001320	We go straight to branding him a bigot.
1001320	1003320	Nonetheless, that same week,
1003320	1006320	James posted an apology to his Insta story saying,
1006320	1008320	Regardless of whatever my intentions were,
1008320	1010320	that came across as me saying
1010320	1013320	I'm not fully gay because I have been with a trans man
1013320	1014320	and that is absolutely,
1014320	1016320	first of all, not true.
1016320	1018320	Like that doesn't make me not fully gay.
1018320	1020320	But that stereotype and implication
1020320	1022320	is really, really dangerous.
1022320	1024320	And I'm very, very sorry.
1024320	1026320	If you are a trans man, you are a man.
1026320	1028320	If you're a trans girl, you are a woman.
1028320	1030320	You are valid in your identity.
1030320	1032320	Could you ask for a better apology?
1032320	1035320	Like he not only apologizes for what he said,
1035320	1037320	but he also demonstrates a clear understanding
1037320	1039320	of why it was wrong.
1039320	1043320	So does that mean people stopped calling him a transphobe?
1043320	1045320	Of course not.
1045320	1048320	Cancel culture trope five, no forgiveness.
1048320	1052320	Cancelers will often dismiss an apology as insincere,
1052320	1054320	no matter how convincingly written or delivered.
1054320	1058320	And of course, an insincere apology is further proof
1058320	1061320	of what a Machiavellian psychopath you really are.
1061320	1063320	Now, sometimes a good apology
1063320	1065320	will calm things down for a while.
1065320	1067320	But the next time there's a scandal,
1067320	1070320	the original accusation will be raised again,
1070320	1072320	as if you never apologized.
1072320	1074320	That's what happened to James during the Tati scandal,
1074320	1079320	when Twitter decided he was a transphobic sexual predator.
1079320	1081320	And that's to say nothing of this racism
1081320	1083320	I've been hearing about.
1083320	1084320	Here's the receipts.
1084320	1085320	Exhibit B.
1085320	1087320	In February 2017,
1087320	1089320	when James was much less famous than he is now,
1089320	1090320	he tweeted,
1090320	1092320	I can't believe we're going to Africa today.
1092320	1094320	OMG, what if we get Ebola?
1094320	1095320	James, we're fine.
1095320	1097320	We could have gotten it at Chipotle last year.
1097320	1101320	Okay, well, that's a little insensitive, maybe.
1101320	1104320	It's not really something an influencer should tweet.
1104320	1108320	And fear of disease associated with Africa.
1108320	1112320	I mean, I can see how it's in the same vague conceptual area
1112320	1114320	as certain racist tropes.
1114320	1117320	But clearly, this was intended as a joke
1117320	1120320	about his friend mistaking Ebola for E. coli, right?
1120320	1123320	And anyway, he did apologize, saying,
1123320	1125320	As a white cis male,
1125320	1126320	I recognize my privilege
1126320	1129320	and would never want to take that for granted.
1129320	1130320	But I fucked up.
1130320	1132320	I feel awful for posting what I said.
1132320	1135320	I understand why what I said was offensive and ignorant.
1135320	1138320	And James hasn't made a habit of making jokes like that ever since.
1138320	1139320	So...
1139320	1142320	Is this one tweet from two years ago
1142320	1143320	that he apologized for
1143320	1145320	on its own enough evidence
1145320	1147320	for us to justify labeling him
1147320	1149320	a racist?
1149320	1152320	Well, according to cancel culture, absolutely.
1152320	1154320	Abstraction takes us from
1154320	1156320	Two years ago, James Charles made a joke
1156320	1159320	that referenced his fear of getting Ebola in Africa
1159320	1162320	to James Charles made a racist joke.
1162320	1164320	And then essentialism takes us to
1164320	1167320	James Charles is a racist.
1174320	1176320	Look, I want to pause to say
1176320	1179320	I really do believe in social justice.
1179320	1183320	At least, as much as trash like me believes in anything.
1183320	1185320	And believe me, I am well aware
1185320	1188320	that jokes, irony, and even complaints about cancel culture
1188320	1193320	are often used by bigots to cloak their real agenda.
1193320	1196320	The Southern Poverty Law Center even cited my video
1196320	1199320	about how far-right racists use jokes and memes
1199320	1201320	and mockery of SJWs
1201320	1204320	as a way to camouflage their hateful beliefs
1204320	1207320	and make them more palatable to a wider audience.
1207320	1210320	So I'm coming at this from a place of genuine concern
1210320	1213320	for anti-racism and anti-transphobia
1213320	1215320	as well as an awareness of the fact
1215320	1217320	that cancel culture is often just
1217320	1220320	a conservative red herring used to shut down
1220320	1223320	any and all complaints about racism or transphobia.
1223320	1227320	But I've also become very disillusioned
1227320	1229320	with the way these accusations are thrown around
1229320	1232320	so frivolously on social media.
1232320	1235320	By the way, they're used to escalate conflict
1235320	1237320	instead of promote understanding.
1237320	1240320	And by the way, they're sometimes weaponized
1240320	1243320	to destroy people who have made mistakes
1243320	1246320	but who really don't deserve to be destroyed.
1246320	1248320	Now maybe you're thinking,
1248320	1250320	destroyed? What do you mean destroyed?
1250320	1252320	James is a 20-year-old millionaire
1252320	1254320	on his way to owning his own makeup empire.
1254320	1257320	And you are completely correct.
1257320	1260320	If you're James Charles, if you're a superstar,
1260320	1263320	then being canceled most likely does not destroy you.
1263320	1267320	The cancelers blend in to the general backdrop of haters
1267320	1270320	and they can set you back a few million subscribers
1270320	1272320	and a lot of emotional turmoil,
1272320	1276320	but in the long run, they can't really touch your success.
1276320	1277320	But here's the thing.
1277320	1279320	What if you're not James Charles?
1279320	1281320	What if you're a small creator?
1281320	1284320	What if you can't afford public relations help?
1284320	1286320	What if you belong to a marginalized community
1286320	1288320	and you rely on that community for support?
1288320	1292320	Well, in that case, it's a whole different story.
1294320	1297320	Let's Irish up this coffee.
1301320	1303320	Shaken, not stirred.
1303320	1305320	Spilled it over my pussy.
1307320	1308320	Mmm, that's good.
1308320	1310320	Booze and coffee is a good combination.
1310320	1312320	I'm feeling amped right now.
1312320	1313320	I'm feeling hype.
1313320	1315320	So this is the part in the video where I should admit
1315320	1317320	that I'm not just a casual observer here.
1317320	1319320	At the time I'm making this video,
1319320	1320320	sweaty,
1320320	1321320	I'm super canceled.
1321320	1324320	You know, I try to make videos that are both informative and entertaining.
1324320	1326320	So in this video, the information is
1326320	1328320	you get to learn about cancel culture
1328320	1330320	and the entertainment is
1330320	1332320	you get to watch a worm try to wriggle off a hook.
1332320	1333320	Let's get started.
1333320	1335320	Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.
1335320	1336320	Hey, how are you?
1336320	1338320	God, I never wanted to be the kind of YouTuber
1338320	1340320	who would resort to making videos about my own drama,
1340320	1343320	but things have gotten to a point.
1343320	1345320	I feel like I cannot continue this channel
1345320	1346320	until I spill some tea.
1346320	1348320	So let's get started.
1348320	1350320	Okay, first, a little backstory, a little mise-en-scene.
1350320	1352320	I've never talked about this on my channel before,
1352320	1355320	so this is a super fucking vulnerable moment for me.
1355320	1357320	But I am, in fact, a transgender woman,
1357320	1360320	which may come as a big shock to many of you
1360320	1362320	since I'm 100% real fesh.
1362320	1365320	I get comments all the time from very solemn people like,
1365320	1369320	guys, I'm pretty sure this is a dude.
1369320	1370320	Great work, detective.
1370320	1371320	You cracked the case.
1371320	1373320	You're doing very good, sweetie.
1373320	1375320	Very, very good.
1375320	1378320	But yes, as one of YouTube's leading B-list transgenders,
1378320	1381320	I am a prime target for cancellation,
1381320	1384320	and I have been canceled many, many times.
1384320	1385320	And we're gonna talk about some of the things
1385320	1386320	I've been canceled for
1386320	1388320	and some of the things I've been criticized for
1388320	1390320	and the difference between criticism and canceling.
1390320	1392320	Because yes, there is a difference.
1392320	1393320	As we go along,
1393320	1395320	I will admit where I have made mistakes
1395320	1396320	because despite how I look,
1396320	1398320	I am not a literal goddess,
1398320	1403320	and I will apologize where I believe apologies are due.
1403320	1406320	However, where I believe that criticism of me
1406320	1408320	is excessive or unwarranted,
1408320	1409320	I will not apologize
1409320	1411320	because here at ContraPoints Industries,
1411320	1413320	we are not in the business of serving bullshit.
1413320	1417320	So, the reason for my current cancellation is,
1417320	1420320	in summary, that in my last video, Opulence,
1420320	1422320	I cast transsexual violence
1422320	1424320	on the beautiful porn star Buck Angel
1424320	1425320	in the role of John Waters.
1425320	1427320	And yes, it's a much better story
1427320	1428320	than the hair vitamin debacle,
1428320	1429320	so notify the drama channels,
1429320	1431320	put in a good word for me,
1431320	1432320	because, sweetie,
1432320	1433320	I'm not here to make friends.
1433320	1434320	I'm here to win.
1434320	1435320	So basically, I'm canceled
1435320	1437320	for collaborating with Buck Angel,
1437320	1438320	and a lot of trans people think
1438320	1441320	Buck Angel is a horrible person.
1441320	1443320	And so my collaboration with Buck Angel
1443320	1445320	is evidence that I, too,
1445320	1447320	am a horrible person.
1447320	1449320	Cancel culture trope six,
1449320	1451320	the transitive property of cancellation.
1451320	1453320	Cancellation is infectious.
1453320	1455320	If you associate with a canceled person,
1455320	1457320	the cancellation rubs off.
1457320	1458320	It's like gonorrhea,
1458320	1461320	except doxycycline won't save you this time, sweetie.
1461320	1463320	Look, this whole incident hinges, first of all,
1463320	1466320	on whether Buck Angel is, in fact,
1466320	1468320	a horrible person.
1468320	1469320	So who is Buck Angel?
1469320	1473320	Well, he's a trans man of my parents' generation.
1473320	1474320	He grew up in a world
1474320	1476320	where there was not anything like the visibility
1476320	1478320	and access to information about transition we have today,
1478320	1480320	and where there was a strict medical gatekeeping system
1480320	1483320	in place for people who wanted to transition.
1483320	1485320	In fact, Buck was the first female-to-male patient
1485320	1487320	his doctor had ever treated.
1487320	1490320	In the 2000s, he rose to prominence as an adult performer,
1490320	1492320	his gimmick at the time being the man with the pussy.
1492320	1494320	But he also became an activist.
1494320	1496320	He wanted to create more positive trans representation
1496320	1497320	within the porn world.
1497320	1499320	And from there, he became a more general educator
1499320	1501320	and advocate for trans people.
1501320	1503320	I first heard about him in the early 2010s
1503320	1505320	when I was doing some Googling
1505320	1508320	about some little gender issues I was having myself,
1508320	1510320	although I ended up deciding to remain a female.
1510320	1512320	And Buck was one of the first female-to-male people
1512320	1513320	I'd ever heard about.
1513320	1514320	And he made an impact on me,
1514320	1516320	in part because you take one look at him and you think,
1516320	1517320	honey, that's a man.
1517320	1519320	But he was born a woman.
1520320	1521320	You can do that.
1521320	1524320	So it's not that he inspired me to transition or anything,
1524320	1526320	it's just, it was one of many moments
1526320	1527320	along my whole entire gender journey.
1527320	1529320	So I had positive feelings about Tran-pa,
1529320	1531320	that's what he calls himself,
1531320	1532320	from back then.
1532320	1533320	And then a few months ago,
1533320	1536320	when I was feeling angry and miserable and despised
1536320	1538320	over another time I was being canceled by trans Twitter,
1538320	1539320	we'll get to that one later,
1539320	1542320	I saw this post from Buck on Instagram.
1569320	1571320	And those were exactly the words I needed to hear
1571320	1572320	at that moment.
1572320	1575320	So I commented a heart and then Buck DMed me
1575320	1576320	and he said, I love you.
1576320	1577320	And I was like,
1577320	1578320	senpai noticed me.
1578320	1580320	And so I said, I love you back.
1580320	1582320	Then when I was working on Opulence,
1582320	1585320	I needed a voice actor to do a line from John Waters' book.
1585320	1588320	And it was my co-director Theron who suggested,
1588320	1590320	don't you think Buck Angel sounds kind of like John Waters?
1590320	1592320	And I said, well, he just messaged me on Insta,
1592320	1593320	let's see if he wants to do it.
1593320	1596320	And I just loved the idea of having Buck Angel
1596320	1598320	as John Waters in the video credits,
1598320	1601320	like a trans icon playing a gay icon.
1601320	1605320	In my head it was just so, well, iconic.
1605320	1606320	So I got in touch with Buck about the line
1606320	1608320	and he was like, yeah, I'd love to do it.
1608320	1609320	So here it is,
1609320	1612320	the 10 second voiceover clip that ruined a month of my life.
1612320	1614320	One must remember,
1614320	1618320	there is such a thing as good bad taste and bad bad taste.
1618320	1620320	To understand bad taste,
1620320	1622320	one must have very good taste.
1622320	1624320	That's it children.
1624320	1626320	That's why mommy's canceled.
1626320	1627320	Now I was aware at the time
1627320	1628320	that trans Twitter hate
1628320	1629320	and hated Buck Angel,
1629320	1630320	but my thinking was,
1630320	1633320	well, trans Twitter kind of hates every trans celebrity
1633320	1635320	and they certainly hate me.
1635320	1637320	So I wasn't going to let that stop me.
1637320	1638320	Little did I know,
1638320	1640320	quite how vicious things were about to get.
1640320	1642320	Now, so far I've been telling this story
1642320	1643320	from my point of view,
1643320	1646320	but I do want to give a fair and balanced account.
1646320	1648320	So I want to pause and contextualize
1648320	1651320	why some trans people hate Buck Angel so much,
1651320	1654320	they're willing to cancel anyone who even associates with him.
1654320	1656320	Basically it all goes back to this old debate
1656320	1657320	in the trans community known today
1657320	1661320	and Tumblr lingo as true scum versus trans trenders.
1661320	1663320	So true scum are trans people
1663320	1665320	who distinguish between true trans people
1665320	1666320	and fake trans people,
1666320	1668320	who they call trenders or too-cutes.
1668320	1671320	Usually true scum think that what it is to be trans
1671320	1673320	is to have a lifelong struggle with dysphoria,
1673320	1676320	to pursue a medical transition involving hormones and surgery,
1676320	1680320	and to socially re-assimilate into your target binary gender,
1680320	1681320	so male or female.
1681320	1682320	Anyone who's not that,
1682320	1683320	according to true scum,
1683320	1685320	must either be a confused teenager,
1685320	1686320	someone just trying to get attention,
1686320	1690320	someone mistaking their trauma or their fetish for being trans,
1690320	1692320	in a word, a trender.
1692320	1694320	So that's a vige of transness
1694320	1696320	that usually excludes non-binary people
1696320	1698320	as well as people who don't want to medically transition
1698320	1699320	for whatever reason,
1699320	1702320	and for that reason this view is sometimes also called
1702320	1703320	transmedicalism.
1703320	1706320	True scum obviously being the derogatory term for these people.
1706320	1709320	So true scum are very hated by a lot of trans people
1709320	1712320	because their viewpoint is that not all trans identities are valid,
1712320	1715320	and Buck Angel is widely perceived to be true scum.
1715320	1717320	So the next question to ask is,
1717320	1718320	is this true?
1718320	1721320	Is Buck Angel in fact true scum?
1721320	1724320	Now my honest answer to that question is,
1724320	1725320	I don't know.
1725320	1728320	He's certainly said some things that sound like things true scum say,
1728320	1729320	I'll give you that.
1729320	1731320	A point he likes to make a lot is that he's transsexual,
1731320	1733320	not transgender.
1733320	1736320	And the difference between those terms is sometimes defined as
1736320	1739320	transsexual implies that you want to pursue medical transition,
1739320	1741320	so hormones and surgery,
1741320	1743320	and transgender doesn't imply that.
1743320	1744320	And people associate this,
1744320	1747320	I'm transsexual not transgender thing with true scum
1747320	1750320	because true scum often call themselves transsexuals
1750320	1753320	and say that anyone who isn't a transsexual isn't really trans.
1753320	1757320	And often those people will be very mean to people they call trenders,
1757320	1760320	especially certain transmedicalist YouTubers like
1760320	1763320	Vanessa LeBlanc and Too Cute Smasher 9000.
1765320	1767320	Too Cute Smasher 9000.
1767320	1769320	Roast me back Calvin, I dare you.
1769320	1776320	But I think it's important to keep in mind that the term true scum
1776320	1779320	is a product of the 2014 Tumblr wars,
1779320	1782320	and trying to apply it to trans people of an older generation
1782320	1784320	can sometimes be misleading.
1784320	1785320	Like when Buck Angel transitioned,
1785320	1788320	the word transsexual was just the word for his identity,
1788320	1790320	and he still identifies that way.
1790320	1793320	So when younger trans people tell him it's wrong to use the word transsexual,
1793320	1797320	he feels like these ungrateful millennials are invalidating his identity.
1797320	1798320	And I do understand where he's coming from,
1798320	1802320	but I also understand why a lot of nonbinary people
1802320	1804320	are skeptical about Buck.
1804320	1805320	Like he says again and again,
1805320	1807320	I'm transsexual, not transgender,
1807320	1809320	like don't mix me up with those people.
1809320	1812320	And that eagerness to separate himself from transgender people,
1812320	1814320	it comes across as hostility.
1814320	1818320	Like I don't think he's ever actually said that nonbinary people aren't valid,
1818320	1822320	but I personally don't like that he seems like he wants to distance himself from them.
1822320	1824320	And that's my disagreement with Buck.
1824320	1826320	It's not that he invalidates nonbinary identities,
1826320	1828320	because I don't really care.
1828320	1829320	I don't really see him doing that.
1829320	1830320	And if he was doing that,
1830320	1831320	I would have seen it.
1831320	1832320	Because for the last two months,
1832320	1836320	a lot of people have been doing nothing but sending me problematic Buck Angel tweets.
1836320	1838320	But as someone who cares a lot about nonbinary people,
1838320	1841320	and who loves the nonbinary people in my life,
1841320	1844320	it does upset me when he does this distancing thing.
1844320	1846320	And I hope he listens to this criticism,
1846320	1849320	because I think it would be cool if he got better about this.
1849320	1853320	Of course, Buck is technically right that there are different kinds of trans people.
1853320	1856320	And I agree it's important that we can make those distinctions
1856320	1858320	and talk about the differences when they're relevant,
1858320	1860320	but I also think that as a community,
1860320	1862320	trans people benefit from unity,
1862320	1863320	not division.
1863320	1866320	Like if you have an employer who discriminates against trans people,
1866320	1868320	they're not going to care if you're transsexual,
1868320	1869320	transgender,
1869320	1870320	nonbinary,
1870320	1871320	or gender nonconforming.
1871320	1873320	They're going to discriminate against you regardless.
1873320	1875320	So we're all in this together.
1875320	1877320	And there's a lot of disagreements among us,
1877320	1879320	and we often don't get along so well.
1879320	1880320	But politically,
1880320	1882320	I think we should work together as much as possible
1882320	1884320	instead of splitting into little factions,
1884320	1887320	because we share most of the same interests.
1887320	1889320	And I think the best way to do that
1889320	1891320	is to build bridges instead of burning them.
1891320	1893320	And that's why I'm willing to work with people like Buck Angel,
1893320	1895320	who I have some disagreements with.
1895320	1897320	It creates a connection, you know?
1897320	1900320	And having that connection can lead to communication
1900320	1901320	and build understanding.
1901320	1903320	Also, I need all the connections I can get, Gorge.
1903320	1905320	I am very lonely.
1906320	1907320	It's not a joke.
1907320	1908320	It's true.
1908320	1910320	Now I get that some people have views that are so harmful
1910320	1913320	that giving them a platform is potentially dangerous.
1913320	1914320	But in any case,
1914320	1916320	I didn't even give Buck a platform to share his opinions.
1916320	1920320	I gave him a platform to be a John Waters impersonator.
1920320	1921320	A bunch of people on my subreddit were like,
1921320	1924320	why couldn't she just get John Waters to do those lines?
1924320	1925320	Well, first of all,
1925320	1926320	I don't actually know John,
1926320	1928320	but I just have a feeling he would write me off
1928320	1931320	as some kind of millennial SJW.
1931320	1933320	Like, why is Buck Angel canceled,
1933320	1934320	but John Waters isn't?
1934320	1937320	Well, because trans Twitter does not know who John Waters is.
1937320	1939320	And let's try to keep it that way.
1939320	1941320	I actually mentioned this to a friend of mine who knows John,
1941320	1943320	and he told me that he and John
1943320	1945320	have actually watched Buck Angel's porn together.
1945320	1948320	So, plot twist.
1949320	1951320	Okay, so trans Twitter won't forgive me
1951320	1953320	unless I condemn Buck Angel as true scum
1953320	1955320	and apologize for ever working with him.
1955320	1957320	But I'm not going to do that,
1957320	1960320	because I don't think it would be the right thing to do.
1960320	1962320	And doing it just to get myself uncancelled
1962320	1963320	would be cowardly.
1963320	1965320	I'm happy to tell you I absolutely disagree
1965320	1967320	with Buck's divisive rhetoric
1967320	1969320	about transsexual versus transgender.
1969320	1971320	I wish he would be an ally to the whole transgender umbrella
1971320	1974320	instead of trying to distance himself from the rest.
1974320	1976320	And I'm happy to hear out the perspective of nonbinary people
1976320	1977320	who don't trust him,
1977320	1979320	because I totally get where they're coming from
1979320	1980320	and I think that's valid.
1980320	1984320	But I also respect the decades of good activism
1984320	1986320	Buck Angel has done for trans people,
1986320	1988320	and I am grateful to him for that.
1988320	1989320	And in light of that,
1989320	1991320	I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt
1991320	1992320	about where his heart is,
1992320	1995320	and express my criticism in a more measured way
1995320	1997320	than just attacking who he is as a person.
1997320	2001320	But Twitter needs to establish that he's a horrible person,
2001320	2004320	because this is the strategy they've chosen to use
2004320	2007320	to establish that I am a horrible person.
2007320	2010320	And if the true scum allegation isn't strong enough to prove it,
2010320	2012320	oh they have other pieces of evidence to fall back on
2012320	2014320	to hold up their conclusion.
2014320	2016320	For example, here's a tweet claiming
2016320	2019320	Natalie's trying so fucking hard
2019320	2021320	to make it sound like the only thing Buck Angel ever did
2021320	2023320	was write a few iffy tweets,
2023320	2026320	and that's just so fucking far from the truth.
2026320	2029320	Dude launched a targeted tabloid harassment campaign
2029320	2031320	outing a trans woman against her will
2031320	2034320	with the specific intent of causing her physical, emotional,
2034320	2035320	and professional harm.
2035320	2036320	The shorter way of saying that
2036320	2038320	is that he wanted to make her suffer,
2038320	2040320	and she very well could have been killed.
2040320	2041320	Yikes.
2041320	2043320	This ain't it, chief.
2043320	2046320	Friendly reminder that this isn't a good look.
2046320	2048320	Maybe don't try to get trans women killed.
2048320	2049320	Disappointing.
2049320	2050320	It sounds pretty serious.
2050320	2052320	Let's investigate.
2052320	2054320	Here's what I've managed to piece together.
2054320	2055320	Scene one.
2055320	2056320	The year is 2003.
2056320	2057320	Los Angeles,
2057320	2058320	where the movie world,
2058320	2059320	the porn world,
2059320	2060320	and the BDSM scene come together
2060320	2062320	in a tale of heartbreak,
2062320	2063320	betrayal,
2063320	2064320	and transsexualism.
2064320	2065320	La La Land.
2065320	2066320	Dramatis Personae.
2066320	2067320	Buck Angel,
2067320	2069320	transsexual porn star.
2069320	2070320	Ilsa Strix,
2070320	2071320	dominatrix,
2071320	2072320	then wife of Buck Angel.
2072320	2073320	Lana Wachowski,
2073320	2076320	wildly successful director of The Matrix,
2076320	2078320	at the time not yet out as a transgender woman.
2078320	2082320	The synopsis is that Ilsa Strix and Buck Angel's marriage ended
2082320	2085320	after Ilsa had an affair with Lana Wachowski,
2085320	2086320	who was not yet out as trans.
2086320	2089320	So Buck was understandably upset about the affair,
2089320	2091320	and in what seems like a petty act of revenge,
2091320	2093320	told a series of magazines
2093320	2095320	that this celebrity director Wachowski
2095320	2098320	was a cross-dresser who had stolen his wife,
2098320	2101320	which I guess was the information he had at the time.
2101320	2105320	So is that outing a trans woman against her will?
2105320	2107320	Well in retrospect it seems like it,
2107320	2110320	though that may not be what he thought he was doing at the time.
2110320	2112320	But to really get to the bottom of this,
2112320	2113320	we have to do some digging.
2113320	2115320	We have to trawl through the dirty details
2115320	2117320	of trans people's personal histories,
2117320	2120320	which I've noticed is one of the internet's favorite activities.
2120320	2122320	So I actually went on eBay
2122320	2126320	and I purchased Rolling Stone issue 991 January 2006,
2126320	2129320	and I'm finally able to reveal
2131320	2133320	that the seller cancelled the order.
2133320	2135320	God damn it!
2135320	2138320	But I was finally able to track down and translate
2138320	2140320	a Spanish version of the Rolling Stone article
2140320	2141320	from the Wayback Machine,
2141320	2145320	and I'm finally able to expose the truth.
2145320	2146320	Stop.
2146320	2148320	Freeze exactly where you are.
2148320	2149320	Take a look at yourself
2149320	2151320	and what all of us have been doing
2151320	2152320	for the last 30 seconds.
2152320	2154320	Who does this behavior remind you of?
2154320	2156320	If your answer is social justice advocates
2156320	2158320	fighting for trans equality,
2158320	2160320	you are incorrect.
2160320	2163320	If your answer is creepy stalkers who hate trans people,
2165320	2167320	I am very suspicious of anyone
2167320	2169320	whose online behavior prompts me
2169320	2171320	to dig through articles full of dead names
2171320	2173320	and sordid scandals involving trans people
2173320	2175320	from almost two decades ago.
2175320	2177320	This is very similar to techniques
2177320	2180320	used against trans people by internet fascists.
2180320	2182320	So I'm pretty suspicious of anyone
2182320	2184320	pushing this kind of investigation.
2184320	2185320	How can you tell the difference
2185320	2187320	between a trans anarcho-socialist
2187320	2188320	with an anime avatar
2188320	2190320	and a Nazi pretending to be
2190320	2192320	a trans anarcho-socialist with an anime avatar?
2192320	2194320	Well, you can't.
2194320	2197320	Anonymous is anonymous is anonymous,
2197320	2199320	whether it's on 4chan or Twitter.
2199320	2201320	So unless Buck Angel, Ilsa Strix,
2201320	2203320	or Lana Wachowski gets in touch with me
2203320	2206320	and lets me know that for some unimaginable reason
2206320	2208320	they want me to publicly dig up
2208320	2210320	their 17-year-old divorce drama,
2210320	2213320	this is none of my fucking business.
2213320	2215320	And it's none of yours either,
2215320	2217320	so shut up and go back to Kiwi Farms
2217320	2218320	where you belong.
2224320	2226320	Let's Irish up this tea.
2230320	2232320	Doesn't work as well with tea.
2232320	2236320	So, setting aside any tabloid drama
2236320	2239320	that may have happened during the Bush administration,
2240320	2242320	I'm saying this in the cuntiest way,
2242320	2244320	and they deserve it.
2244320	2247320	They fucking deserve the cuntiness.
2247320	2251320	I'm spilling whiskey tea all over my goddamn bathroom.
2251320	2252320	I'm a lady.
2252320	2253320	She's a woman.
2253320	2255320	The main argument against me
2255320	2257320	usually references a collage
2257320	2259320	of Buck Angel's problematic tweets.
2259320	2261320	And this is supposed to be definitive evidence
2261320	2263320	that he is a horrible person,
2263320	2264320	and therefore,
2264320	2266320	that I am a horrible person
2266320	2267320	for collaborating with him.
2267320	2269320	Well, here's the thing, though.
2269320	2271320	A collage of problematic tweets
2271320	2273320	does not define a person.
2273320	2276320	And I'm very used to being defined that way myself,
2276320	2278320	so I know how unfair it can be.
2278320	2280320	Before I ever collaborated with Buck Angel,
2280320	2282320	a lot of people on Twitter
2282320	2284320	were already calling me truscum.
2284320	2286320	That's been going on a year and a half now.
2286320	2288320	And anytime my name comes up on Twitter,
2288320	2289320	a bunch of people respond saying
2289320	2290320	Natalie is truscum,
2290320	2292320	Natalie is a transmedicalist,
2292320	2293320	Natalie hates nonbinary people,
2293320	2295320	and you should really think
2295320	2296320	what kind of message you're sending
2296320	2298320	to your trans and nonbinary followers
2298320	2300320	by platforming her.
2300320	2302320	And if the person defends me
2302320	2303320	or argues back in any way,
2303320	2304320	they say,
2304320	2306320	I can't believe you're ignoring
2306320	2308320	the valid concerns of marginalized people.
2308320	2310320	You know, they're weaponizing
2310320	2312320	their marginalized status as trans people
2312320	2314320	to isolate and attack
2314320	2316320	another trans person.
2316320	2318320	And sometimes this stuff gets to my head, too.
2318320	2319320	I start asking myself,
2319320	2321320	wait, am I a transmedicalist?
2321320	2323320	Do I really believe all these awful things
2323320	2324320	they say I believe?
2324320	2325320	But the answer is,
2325320	2326320	no.
2326320	2327320	I just don't.
2327320	2329320	These things they're saying about me
2329320	2331320	are 100% not true.
2331320	2333320	You know, believe marginalized people
2333320	2335320	is a norm that is encouraged
2335320	2337320	in leftist spaces for good reason,
2337320	2339320	much like believe victims
2339320	2340320	or believe women.
2340320	2342320	And these norms were established
2342320	2344320	to counterbalance the mainstream tendency,
2344320	2346320	which is not to listen
2346320	2347320	to marginalized people
2347320	2348320	or to victims
2348320	2349320	or to women.
2349320	2351320	But any norm can be abused.
2351320	2353320	And the blunt fact of the matter is,
2353320	2356320	sometimes marginalized people are wrong.
2356320	2358320	Sometimes people calling themselves victims
2358320	2361320	are obscuring a more complicated situation.
2361320	2364320	And it's even happened once or twice
2364320	2366320	that a woman has lied.
2366320	2369320	And the accusation that I'm truscum
2369320	2371320	is simply false.
2371320	2373320	I mean, first of all,
2373320	2375320	I don't even think of my own transgenderism
2375320	2376320	as a medical disorder,
2376320	2378320	much less everyone else's.
2378320	2380320	I have, of course, collaborated with Dr. Spiegel
2380320	2381320	at all,
2381320	2383320	but I will not have my artistry
2383320	2385320	reduced to mere medicine.
2385320	2386320	Second,
2386320	2389320	this accusation that I hate non-binary people
2389320	2390320	is just...
2390320	2391320	no.
2391320	2392320	Non.
2392320	2393320	Eh...
2394320	2395320	Non.
2395320	2396320	My thinking about trans identity
2396320	2399320	has always been informed by non-binary people.
2399320	2401320	I used to identify as non-binary myself
2401320	2403320	before I medically transitioned,
2403320	2404320	and some of the closest people to me
2404320	2405320	in my life today
2405320	2407320	are non-binary trans people,
2407320	2411320	some of whom are also transsexuals, incidentally.
2411320	2412320	It's complicated.
2412320	2414320	I've also made at least five videos on this channel
2414320	2417320	arguing for the validity of non-binary gender identities
2417320	2419320	going back more than three years.
2419320	2421320	So that's five out of around 50 videos,
2421320	2424320	or 10% of the content I've made on this channel,
2424320	2426320	is about non-binary identity.
2426320	2427320	A few months ago,
2427320	2430320	I even made a 30-minute video called TransTrenders,
2430320	2432320	which uses character dialogue to show
2432320	2434320	what I think are the shortcomings of transmedicalism.
2434320	2436320	But there's still hundreds of people on Twitter
2436320	2439320	saying that I'm truscum who hates non-binary people.
2439320	2441320	And their main piece of evidence for that
2441320	2444320	is a collage of my problematic tweets.
2444320	2446320	So let's take a look at that.
2446320	2447320	Here's the three tweets
2447320	2449320	that I usually see scrapbooked together
2449320	2452320	as definitive proof that I hate non-binary people.
2452320	2453320	This is the first one,
2453320	2454320	from September 2018.
2454320	2456320	Notice how it's taken out of context from the thread
2456320	2458320	so you can't even see what I'm talking about.
2458320	2461320	I'm sure this is not the experience of many NBs
2461320	2462320	.
2462320	2464320	I leave it to them to articulate
2464320	2467320	what NB existence looks like in a binary world.
2467320	2469320	I do not and I cannot speak for them.
2469320	2470320	But surely N-
2470320	2473320	God, I used to write like such a nerd.
2473320	2474320	But surely N-
2474320	2476320	The account that begins and ends
2476320	2479320	with I'm not a man because I don't identify as one
2479320	2480320	is pretty weak.
2480320	2482320	Okay, when I wrote the Twitter thread
2482320	2484320	that that tweet has been clipped out of,
2484320	2487320	I was defending myself from accusations
2487320	2489320	that my most recent video at the time,
2489320	2490320	The Aesthetic,
2490320	2491320	was anti-non-binary.
2491320	2492320	In that video,
2492320	2494320	there's a character named Justine
2494320	2497320	who defends a version of the performativity theory of gender.
2497320	2499320	And basically I made this video
2499320	2501320	to express some angst I was feeling
2501320	2503320	about the pressures of transitioning in the public eye.
2503320	2506320	This was a very one-year-on-hormones moment for me,
2506320	2508320	and I've already moved on in my thinking.
2508320	2510320	At that time I was very, um,
2510320	2513320	my behavior must be perfectly feminine at all times
2513320	2515320	or else I'm not really a woman.
2515320	2518320	My self-esteem is totally based on sleeping with heterosexual men
2518320	2519320	who resemble my father.
2521320	2523320	And anyone who knows anything about trans women knows
2523320	2526320	that most of us go through a stage like this at some point.
2526320	2528320	And some YouTubers never get out of it.
2528320	2531320	But personally, I mean these days,
2531320	2532320	it doesn't matter what I wear.
2532320	2536320	It's when I dream they're Lily's dreams.
2538320	2539320	Dragging the Danish girl.
2539320	2540320	Well, fuck the Danish.
2540320	2542320	I could never abide that sort of person.
2542320	2543320	We all know what I'm talking about.
2543320	2545320	You can tell the whiskey is getting to me
2545320	2548320	because I'm being bigoted against the Danish.
2548320	2550320	These things come out, you know.
2550320	2552320	You get honest, you get real
2552320	2555320	when you get a little bit of the Irish in your system.
2555320	2559320	Did I just fucking put lipstick outside the fucking lip liner?
2559320	2560320	This is all Lily's fault.
2560320	2561320	Lily Alba.
2561320	2563320	Fuck her dreams.
2563320	2565320	The point is, when I was making the aesthetic,
2565320	2567320	I wasn't even thinking about non-binary people.
2567320	2570320	And people will say that the fact that not every video I make
2570320	2574320	references non-binary people is itself NB-phobic.
2574320	2577320	As I've said, about one in ten of my videos
2577320	2579320	is about non-binary identity.
2579320	2581320	But not all of them are.
2581320	2584320	And I feel entitled to make some videos
2584320	2586320	that are just about trans women.
2586320	2589320	But still, some people on Twitter were saying
2589320	2592320	that the character Justine is a transmedicalist.
2592320	2597320	And because she maybe wins the fictional debate in the video,
2597320	2601320	I, Natalie Nguyen, am therefore a transmedicalist.
2601320	2603320	Here's the thing, though.
2603320	2605320	The performativity theory of gender,
2605320	2607320	the one that Justine defends in that video,
2607320	2611320	is conceptually as far away from transmedicalism
2611320	2613320	as it is possible to be.
2613320	2616320	Transmedicalism says that trans identity is biological,
2616320	2618320	it's neurological, it's hormonal,
2618320	2620320	it's diagnosable and treatable.
2620320	2624320	Whereas performativity says that gender is gesture,
2624320	2626320	it's expression, it's performance,
2626320	2628320	it's a social phenomenon.
2628320	2632320	Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon. Phenomenon.
2632320	2633320	Phenomenon.
2633320	2636320	Performativity makes no reference to gender dysphoria
2636320	2638320	or to any kind of medical concept at all.
2638320	2642320	So whereas transmedicalism is a kind of bioessentialism,
2642320	2645320	performativity is a kind of social constructionism.
2645320	2648320	So these are exact opposite theories of gender,
2648320	2650320	are you following along, class?
2650320	2651320	I'm not.
2651320	2654320	I'm ready to drink Jameson tea until I die.
2654320	2656320	But some trans people felt invalidated
2656320	2659320	by things Justine says in that video.
2659320	2661320	And transmedicalism is another thing
2661320	2663320	that makes them feel invalidated.
2663320	2666320	So they decided that Justine is a transmedicalist
2666320	2669320	and therefore that I am a transmedicalist.
2669320	2672320	And this is literally just bad media comprehension.
2672320	2676320	Like it's a failure to plausibly interpret a video
2676320	2680320	that some people did find genuinely emotionally difficult.
2680320	2682320	And so much of the negative response to that video
2682320	2683320	is just pure emotion.
2683320	2684320	I always hear,
2684320	2686320	I don't care what you intended,
2686320	2688320	trans people were hurt by that video.
2688320	2690320	You hurt trans people.
2690320	2691320	But here's the thing.
2691320	2694320	Just because you were hurt by content I made
2694320	2696320	doesn't mean that the content is bad
2696320	2698320	or that I'm victimizing you in some way.
2698320	2699320	I'll give you an example.
2699320	2701320	I did a stream a couple years ago
2701320	2704320	with a BDSM and kink activist.
2704320	2705320	We were talking about various kinks
2705320	2707320	and we got to DDLG,
2707320	2709320	which is Daddy Dom Little Girl.
2709320	2714320	Basically, when consenting adults roleplay age difference
2714320	2716320	and the power dynamic that comes with that.
2716320	2717320	And me and this kink activist
2717320	2720320	were just casually discussing what DDLG is,
2720320	2721320	what it isn't,
2721320	2723320	when I noticed someone in the chat
2723320	2725320	was starting to totally freak out.
2725320	2727320	They were typing in all caps like,
2727320	2730320	MY ABUSER USED DDLG TO JUSTIFY RAPING ME.
2730320	2732320	WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING MY ABUSER?
2732320	2734320	I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'D BETRAY ME LIKE THIS.
2734320	2735320	PLEASE STOP TAKING MONEY
2735320	2736320	FROM MY ABUSER'S SIDE.
2736320	2737320	PLEASE STOP.
2737320	2738320	I'M BEGGING YOU.
2738320	2740320	This was actually really fucking upsetting to me
2740320	2743320	because this person was clearly in a lot of pain.
2743320	2745320	They were having a panic attack
2745320	2748320	because they were having a trauma trigger reaction
2748320	2749320	to this conversation.
2749320	2751320	And I kept telling them to leave the stream
2751320	2753320	and take care of themselves,
2753320	2754320	but they wouldn't do it.
2754320	2756320	So I had to block them
2756320	2757320	and then later get in touch
2757320	2759320	and make sure they were okay.
2759320	2762320	Now, was their pain very real?
2762320	2763320	Yes.
2763320	2764320	Was it triggered
2764320	2766320	by the content I was streaming?
2766320	2767320	Yes.
2767320	2769320	But does that mean I did anything wrong?
2769320	2770320	No.
2770320	2772320	Is it wrong to talk about kink
2772320	2773320	in contexts where it's clear
2773320	2775320	you're going to be talking about kink?
2775320	2776320	No.
2776320	2779320	But when you produce content online
2779320	2780320	that's going to be viewed by thousands
2780320	2781320	or millions of people,
2781320	2783320	there's always some people out there
2783320	2785320	who are going to be hurt by it.
2785320	2787320	So if you want to argue that a tweet
2787320	2790320	or a video I made is somehow immoral,
2790320	2792320	I think you need more of an argument
2792320	2793320	than just,
2793320	2794320	people were hurt.
2794320	2796320	Alright, back to the tweet.
2796320	2797320	To this day,
2797320	2799320	people quote tweet the sentence,
2799320	2801320	but surely an account that begins and ends
2801320	2802320	with I'm not a man
2802320	2803320	because I don't identify as one
2803320	2804320	is pretty weak.
2804320	2805320	And they claim this is evidence
2805320	2806320	that I'm true scum
2806320	2808320	or that I think people have to prove
2808320	2809320	their identities somehow,
2809320	2811320	which is not at all
2811320	2813320	what I was saying in that thread.
2813320	2814320	What I was saying is
2814320	2817320	if you're trying to persuade a skeptic
2817320	2819320	that trans identity is valid,
2819320	2821320	simply saying I'm not a man
2821320	2822320	because I don't identify as one
2822320	2824320	isn't a very good argument,
2824320	2825320	which it isn't.
2825320	2827320	I mean, no one has ever been persuaded by that
2827320	2828320	so far as I'm aware.
2828320	2829320	That said,
2829320	2831320	I do now disagree with the mindset
2831320	2833320	I had when I tweeted this.
2833320	2835320	Back then, I still delusionally believed
2835320	2837320	that it was possible to rationally explain
2837320	2839320	why trans identity is valid,
2839320	2840320	and I was simply looking for
2840320	2842320	a more persuasive argument than,
2842320	2844320	this is how I identify,
2844320	2845320	you have to believe me,
2845320	2846320	no further questions.
2846320	2848320	But I no longer believe there can be
2848320	2851320	any rational justification of gender identity,
2851320	2852320	which is another reason
2852320	2853320	I'm not a transmedicalist.
2853320	2856320	Transmedicalism tries to be a rational theory
2856320	2858320	about why trans identity is valid,
2858320	2860320	and I don't think it succeeds as that.
2860320	2861320	I don't think anything does.
2861320	2863320	My current opinion about this is that
2863320	2866320	I'm not a man because I don't identify as one
2866320	2868320	is as good, or rather as bad,
2868320	2870320	an argument as any.
2870320	2872320	You know, some things in life just
2872320	2874320	can't be rationally explained.
2874320	2875320	Like love.
2875320	2877320	Why do you love the person you love?
2877320	2879320	Well, because you love them.
2879320	2880320	You could write a poem about it,
2880320	2882320	or some gay shit like that,
2882320	2884320	but you can't give any actual arguments.
2884320	2886320	And why am I a woman?
2887320	2888320	Because I'm a woman.
2888320	2889320	That's it.
2889320	2891320	I mean, I can describe my experiences
2891320	2892320	and my feelings to you
2892320	2894320	to help you understand better,
2894320	2896320	but I can't logically prove anything.
2896320	2898320	And I'm super fucking sorry
2898320	2900320	if you can't handle that mankind
2900320	2902320	was set adrift in an absurd world.
2902320	2904320	That must be super fucking hard for you.
2904320	2906320	Tell me all about it.
2906320	2907320	Next please.
2907320	2909320	Okay, again we're mid-thread
2909320	2910320	with missing context,
2910320	2911320	but the tweet says,
2911320	2913320	whereas I've met 20-year-olds
2913320	2915320	in full-on boy mode who are like,
2915320	2916320	hi, I'm a trans woman.
2916320	2917320	She, her pronouns.
2917320	2920320	So, I guess by including this tweet
2920320	2923320	in the ContraPoints' problematic collage,
2923320	2926320	people are implying that I don't think
2926320	2928320	it's valid for someone who presents male
2928320	2929320	to identify as a woman
2929320	2931320	and request she, her pronouns.
2931320	2932320	Well, that's not true.
2932320	2934320	I was surprised when I first experienced this,
2934320	2936320	but I think it's valid.
2936320	2937320	Next.
2937320	2938320	Okay, mid-thread, no context,
2938320	2940320	once again.
2940320	2942320	But now you go into these leftist Discord
2942320	2943320	slash Facebook groups
2943320	2946320	and like 20-30% identify as some flavor of trans.
2946320	2949320	Most of them are not conventional binary transsexuals.
2949320	2951320	That seems to be the future.
2951320	2952320	Okay, well,
2952320	2954320	it's true that many leftist Discord servers
2954320	2955320	are like this.
2955320	2956320	But reading this back,
2956320	2959320	I don't like the way the phrase
2959320	2961320	conventional binary transsexuals
2961320	2962320	is hitting my ear.
2962320	2964320	I can see how it could imply that
2964320	2967320	non-binary identities are somehow newfangled,
2967320	2968320	which isn't true.
2968320	2970320	There's been non-binary people for longer
2970320	2972320	than there's been medical transsexuals,
2972320	2973320	in fact,
2973320	2975320	so we'll call this a bad tweet.
2975320	2977320	I apologize for tweeting it,
2977320	2979320	and I apologize to any non-binary people
2979320	2981320	who felt trivialized by it.
2982320	2984320	Okay, this is the big one.
2984320	2985320	This tweet got its own article
2985320	2987320	in the fucking Guardian.
2987320	2988320	You know, I really wish people
2988320	2989320	would pay less attention to the tweets
2989320	2991320	I spend 30 seconds writing
2991320	2993320	and a little more attention to the videos
2993320	2994320	that I spend, you know,
2994320	2996320	hundreds of hours making.
2996320	2998320	Anyway, let's look at the tweet.
2998320	3000320	This is the most scrutinized paragraph
3000320	3001320	I've ever written,
3001320	3003320	and it's so mediocre.
3003320	3004320	This has happened to me before
3004320	3006320	in hyper-woke spaces.
3006320	3008320	Like, it's me and a bunch of cis women,
3008320	3009320	and we all have to go in a circle
3009320	3011320	saying she, her, because I'm there.
3011320	3012320	There's this paradox
3012320	3013320	where I can go to a sports bar
3013320	3014320	in North Carolina
3014320	3015320	and be Miss Mamed all night,
3015320	3016320	no question.
3016320	3019320	But in self-consciously trans-inclusive spaces,
3019320	3020320	I have to explain my pronouns
3020320	3021320	and watch woke people
3021320	3023320	awkwardly correct themselves
3023320	3024320	every time they say,
3024320	3025320	you guys.
3025320	3026320	I guess it's good for people
3026320	3027320	who use they, them only
3027320	3029320	and want only gender-neutral language,
3029320	3031320	but it comes at the minor expense
3031320	3033320	of semi-passable transes like me,
3033320	3036320	and that's super fucking hard for us.
3036320	3038320	So people interpreted this tweet
3038320	3040320	as me being against the practice
3040320	3041320	of sharing pronouns,
3041320	3044320	which I'm literally just not.
3044320	3045320	Like, I've actually been the person
3045320	3047320	who initiates the pronoun circle
3047320	3048320	many times.
3048320	3050320	The backstory of this tweet
3050320	3051320	is basically that
3051320	3053320	I once got triggered
3053320	3054320	in a situation
3054320	3056320	where I was with a bunch of cis women
3056320	3057320	and we all had to go around
3057320	3059320	saying our pronouns,
3059320	3061320	and like a typical triggered tranny,
3061320	3063320	I tiptoed over to Twitter
3063320	3066320	to tip-top type it out.
3066320	3067320	But here's the thing,
3067320	3068320	by the end of this thread,
3068320	3070320	I had already talked myself away
3070320	3071320	from the initial frustration
3071320	3072320	I was expressing.
3072320	3074320	If you know my videos and my voice,
3074320	3075320	then you know me saying
3075320	3077320	it comes at the minor expense
3077320	3080320	of semi-passable transes
3080320	3083320	and that's super fucking hard for us
3083320	3084320	is sarcastic.
3084320	3086320	It's a minor expense
3086320	3088320	It's not actually very hard
3088320	3089320	for us, Gorge.
3089320	3091320	It's fine.
3091320	3092320	But people on Twitter
3092320	3094320	don't watch my videos
3094320	3096320	and they don't get sarcasm.
3096320	3099320	So people flipped out over this.
3099320	3101320	I was getting dragged
3101320	3103320	and I made the poor decision
3103320	3105320	to try to solve the tweet problem
3105320	3106320	with more tweeting,
3106320	3108320	which 100% of the time
3108320	3110320	is like trying to put out a fire
3110320	3112320	with lighter fluid.
3112320	3114320	So me and my dumb brain
3114320	3115320	did another short thread
3115320	3117320	trying to clarify what I was saying
3117320	3118320	and defending my right
3118320	3120320	to talk about my own experiences.
3120320	3122320	That didn't make things any better.
3122320	3125320	So in a state of anger and frustration,
3125320	3127320	I tweeted out yet another thread.
3127320	3128320	And this time I said
3128320	3130320	some truly stupid things,
3130320	3132320	including the now infamous line.
3132320	3134320	I sometimes feel like the last
3134320	3137320	of the old school transsexuals.
3137320	3139320	I honestly don't know what the fuck
3139320	3141320	I was even trying to say.
3141320	3143320	I don't feel like the last
3143320	3144320	of the old school transsexuals.
3144320	3146320	I don't even know what that means.
3146320	3148320	I guess I basically meant that
3148320	3152320	offline, I don't have any radical aspirations.
3152320	3154320	You know, I want to be inconspicuous.
3154320	3155320	I want to blend in.
3155320	3157320	And that's what I meant by old school.
3157320	3160320	You know, I want people to assume my pronouns.
3160320	3161320	You know, it's funny because
3161320	3163320	it is very different from the way I am online
3163320	3166320	where I'm totally shameless and open.
3166320	3167320	I'm like,
3167320	3168320	sexual confession, everybody.
3168320	3169320	Sexual confession.
3169320	3172320	I have abnormal urges.
3172320	3173320	It's 1am.
3173320	3174320	My name is Amy.
3174320	3176320	My neighbors can definitely hear that.
3176320	3178320	They know I have abnormal urges now.
3178320	3180320	They already knew that.
3180320	3183320	But offline, I'm an inconspicuous pussy,
3183320	3184320	like a total coward.
3184320	3185320	So,
3185320	3187320	this was a rage thread
3187320	3189320	and I apologize for tweeting it.
3195320	3197320	Let's go back to Bug Angel.
3197320	3199320	I'm kind of a conscientious objector
3199320	3201320	to the practice of condemning someone
3201320	3203320	based on a collage of their worst tweets
3203320	3204320	taken out of context.
3204320	3207320	But I definitely do have anxiety about this.
3207320	3209320	Like, I think I'm doing the right thing
3209320	3211320	by not condemning Buck as true scum and evil,
3211320	3214320	but I mean, I could be wrong.
3214320	3216320	What if I am basically sacrificing myself
3216320	3218320	for the sake of a person who really is
3218320	3220320	as bad as Twitter says?
3220320	3221320	Maybe tomorrow he'll tweet,
3221320	3222320	fuck non-binary people,
3222320	3224320	and then I'll have fucked up.
3224320	3227320	This whole thing is incredibly stressful to me.
3227320	3231320	But I do believe that by refusing to participate
3231320	3232320	in the anti-Buck Angel pilot,
3232320	3237320	I am erring on the morally safer side of things.
3237320	3239320	Because even if he is a little true scummy,
3239320	3242320	excommunicating him from the trans community
3242320	3245320	is still probably not the best approach to take.
3245320	3246320	In my experience,
3246320	3249320	when people accept binary but not non-binary trans people,
3249320	3252320	it usually takes like a 30 minute conversation
3252320	3255320	to win them over to some level of non-binary acceptance.
3255320	3257320	And I'll give you a couple examples.
3257320	3259320	The first time I was ever canceled,
3259320	3261320	like totally trashed on Twitter,
3261320	3263320	was back in 2017,
3263320	3265320	when I had not yet medically transitioned,
3265320	3268320	and at the time I identified as non-binary.
3268320	3270320	And at VidCon 2017,
3270320	3273320	I met up with a YouTuber named June,
3273320	3275320	who had made some videos where she basically
3275320	3277320	mocked the idea of non-binary people.
3277320	3281320	And I posted a picture of the brunch I had with June,
3281320	3282320	and some other people,
3282320	3283320	but let's keep them out of it.
3283320	3285320	And people on Twitter totally dragged me
3285320	3287320	for being a peak liberal bootlicker
3287320	3289320	who's best friends with transphobic abusers.
3289320	3290320	Christ.
3291320	3293320	Fucking people, man.
3293320	3295320	It's so fucking frustrating.
3295320	3296320	And, you know,
3296320	3298320	I'm not gonna claim I changed June's mind,
3298320	3300320	because I don't know what her thought process was,
3300320	3303320	but I did talk to her about non-binary identity,
3303320	3306320	and she did remove her anti-non-binary videos.
3306320	3308320	And I don't have any regrets about that brunch.
3313320	3314320	Example two.
3314320	3315320	A couple months later,
3315320	3319320	I did a livestream with a conservative trans woman YouTuber
3319320	3320320	named...
3321320	3323320	What was her name?
3323320	3324320	Sharon?
3324320	3325320	Sharon?
3325320	3326320	Was it Sharon?
3326320	3328320	I guess she's just not a very memorable person.
3328320	3330320	Anyway, she had made some videos saying
3330320	3332320	that non-binary identities aren't real.
3332320	3333320	But I gave her a chance,
3333320	3334320	and she surprised me
3334320	3336320	by being super compassionate and thoughtful.
3336320	3337320	By the end of that stream,
3337320	3340320	she was pretty much totally accepting of my identity.
3340320	3341320	So again,
3341320	3343320	the point is not that I'm some kind of persuasive genius.
3343320	3344320	If I was a persuasive genius,
3344320	3347320	maybe I could talk myself out of being canceled.
3347320	3349320	The point is that sometimes,
3349320	3351320	people who seem ignorant or hate me,
3351320	3354320	just need to be given a non-judgmental space
3354320	3356320	to learn and grow and think.
3356320	3358320	And to just condemn them as hopeless bigots
3358320	3360320	actually prevents that growth from happening.
3360320	3361320	And Sharon,
3361320	3362320	despite her, you know,
3362320	3364320	totally forgettable personality,
3364320	3366320	turned out to be an incredibly open-minded person.
3366320	3367320	Like later on,
3367320	3369320	she actually made an apology video to non-binary people,
3369320	3371320	and I became good friends with her.
3371320	3374320	And we worked together on most of the videos I've made this year.
3374320	3375320	You know,
3375320	3376320	until she ruined my life
3376320	3378320	by recommending a canceled John Waters impersonator.
3378320	3379320	I guess the moral is,
3379320	3380320	NEVER
3380320	3382320	talk to people you disagree with.
3382320	3384320	It will only lead to pain.
3393320	3395320	I do think there's something off with my hormone dose.
3395320	3396320	Like,
3396320	3398320	I'm crying three times a day.
3398320	3400320	Oh, and I can't cum unless there's vibrators
3400320	3401320	in at least three of my holes.
3401320	3403320	It happens like once a month.
3403320	3404320	There has to be a full moon.
3404320	3406320	I honestly only still bother
3406320	3408320	because it numbs the pain for a few moments.
3408320	3409320	What I'm trying to say is,
3409320	3411320	I really do believe in conversation,
3411320	3413320	which means hearing out multiple perspectives.
3413320	3415320	I don't want my audience to get all their information
3415320	3417320	about trans people from me,
3417320	3419320	and I think it's important to listen to criticism.
3419320	3421320	So I encourage my audience to go watch
3421320	3423320	some non-binary YouTubers
3423320	3425320	who have criticized me and criticized Buck Angel.
3425320	3426320	For example,
3426320	3430320	go check out non-binary YouTuber Luxander's video about me,
3430320	3433320	and non-binary YouTuber Corviday's video about Buck Angel.
3433320	3436320	I think YouTube, as a platform,
3436320	3438320	is better at producing criticism
3438320	3440320	rather than canceling.
3440320	3441320	And I think that's because,
3441320	3443320	at least in the vlog format,
3443320	3446320	making a video forces you to confront the fact
3446320	3449320	that you're a human being with a face and a name
3449320	3452320	who can be held accountable for the things that you say.
3452320	3453320	But people on Twitter,
3453320	3454320	it's a different story.
3454320	3455320	And I think it's time we take a look
3455320	3457320	at what canceling really is.
3457320	3459320	I've given you enough context now
3459320	3461320	for you to understand what I'm about to show you,
3461320	3464320	which is what I saw on my timeline every day
3464320	3465320	for nearly a month.
3465320	3467320	All these tweets are from the aftermath
3467320	3469320	of my uploading Opulence,
3469320	3470320	two months ago,
3470320	3472320	when the Buck Angel scandal first broke.
3472320	3474320	And someone better hold my hand now,
3474320	3475320	because this gets ugly.
3478320	3481320	Hey, if any of you still support ContraPoints
3481320	3483320	after her bigging up and collaborating
3483320	3485320	with notable TERF favorite and true scum Buck Angel,
3485320	3487320	you're no friend to gender non-conforming,
3487320	3490320	non-passing, and non-binary trans people.
3490320	3491320	Fuck her,
3491320	3493320	and fuck her fucking rift.
3493320	3495320	I am absolutely furious right now.
3495320	3497320	Weird how I'm 30 and trans,
3497320	3498320	and manage not to be a true scum.
3498320	3500320	Maybe I'm just some kind of anomaly.
3500320	3503320	Or maybe ContraPoints is a conniving rat fucking capo
3503320	3506320	who could do with a fully wound backhand to the mouth.
3506320	3507320	Since I'm out of Twitter jail now,
3507320	3508320	I just want to say,
3508320	3510320	fuck ContraPoints,
3510320	3511320	her sycophantic stans,
3511320	3513320	and all her bread tube chums
3513320	3514320	who close ranks to protect her
3514320	3516320	after she throws the rest of the trans community
3516320	3518320	under the bus for profit.
3518320	3520320	Natalie Nguyen is a fucking grifter.
3520320	3522320	ContraPoints' videos are now just style over substance,
3522320	3525320	so that explains why she took to TERF ideology so well.
3525320	3526320	ContraPoints working with true scum,
3526320	3528320	now definitively proves
3528320	3530320	that pretty much everyone defending ContraPoints
3530320	3532320	just hates enbies,
3532320	3533320	and are also true scum.
3533320	3535320	Legit gonna start on following peeps
3535320	3537320	that continue to follow ContraPoints at this point.
3537320	3540320	Do know my wording of pretty much everyone.
3540320	3541320	I know there are some
3541320	3544320	that were probably blindsided by this somehow.
3544320	3546320	So long as you know that ContraPoints is true scum,
3546320	3548320	you're safe and cool.
3548320	3549320	Eat shit, Natalie.
3549320	3551320	For someone who used to identify as genderqueer,
3551320	3553320	we expected more from you,
3553320	3555320	but I guess when your head's this far up your own ass,
3555320	3557320	it's hard to consider others.
3557320	3560320	ContraPoints, more like DisaPoints.
3560320	3561320	That's a good one.
3561320	3563320	If you're gonna drag me, at least be funny.
3563320	3564320	Fuck Buck Angel.
3564320	3566320	Fuck ContraPoints.
3566320	3568320	Fuck any real transsexual.
3568320	3570320	Fuck your grift.
3570320	3573320	Here's what hashtag ContraPoints stands don't understand.
3573320	3575320	If Natalie refuses to accept
3575320	3577320	that she has an apology to make,
3577320	3579320	and continues profiting from it,
3579320	3581320	it will become our responsibility
3581320	3582320	to work on deplatforming her
3582320	3584320	just like every other racist, sexist,
3584320	3586320	bigoted content creator.
3586320	3588320	No one has actually suggested or attempted
3588320	3589320	to actually cancel her,
3589320	3591320	but the longer this goes on without an apology
3591320	3593320	and commitment to do better,
3593320	3594320	the stronger the case becomes
3594320	3597320	for actively working to deplatform her.
3597320	3598320	So, in other words,
3598320	3600320	no one has suggested we cancel her,
3600320	3602320	but we should cancel her.
3602320	3603320	Great.
3603320	3605320	Can everyone finally agree
3605320	3608320	that ContraPoints belongs directly inside a garbage can?
3608320	3609320	Here I am, sweetie.
3609320	3611320	ContraPoints collaborating with Angel Buck.
3611320	3613320	Angel Buck.
3613320	3614320	Thanks for letting us all know
3614320	3617320	that you had no idea who he even was
3617320	3620320	until Twitter notified you what to be outraged about.
3620320	3623320	ContraPoints collaborating with Angel Buck,
3623320	3625320	a transmedicalist who once outed a trans person
3625320	3627320	to try and destroy them,
3627320	3628320	and supporting him because
3628320	3630320	he looks and sounds like a proper man,
3630320	3634320	isn't a small, itty-bitty, tipsy-topsy fucking mistake.
3634320	3636320	This is a huge deal.
3636320	3639320	ContraPoints could be literally collaborating with Hitler.
3640320	3642320	We have a Hitler comparison.
3642320	3645320	We could be literally collaborating with Hitler today.
3645320	3646320	And you all would be like,
3646320	3649320	oh, well, she's just a little flawed, you know.
3649320	3650320	Fuck off.
3650320	3652320	Can Natalie Wynne stop being a coward
3652320	3654320	and commit to being a transmed?
3654320	3656320	It's really tiring to watch this happen every week.
3656320	3658320	Natalie Wynne is a spoiled brat
3658320	3660320	who refuses to take accountability.
3660320	3661320	Anyone who supports Natalie Wynne
3661320	3663320	does not support nonbinary people.
3663320	3665320	Natalie Wynne is such a terrible person.
3665320	3666320	My God.
3666320	3669320	Every cis and not nonbinary person
3669320	3671320	who thought Natalie Wynne wasn't transmed
3671320	3674320	now owes me and every nonbinary person $50.
3674320	3676320	Joe Biden has a better position on the validity
3676320	3678320	of nonbinary gender than ContraPoints.
3678320	3682320	My opinion is that ContraPoints really sucks a lot
3682320	3683320	and I don't like her.
3683320	3685320	I hate ContraPoints so goddamn much
3685320	3686320	it's unbelievable.
3686320	3688320	ContraPoints be like,
3688320	3690320	let's hear some nonbinary people.
3690320	3692320	This is a very good impression of me.
3692320	3693320	You're doing very good, sweetie.
3693320	3695320	You're doing very, very good.
3695320	3697320	Buck Angel is a TERF apologizer,
3697320	3699320	bootlicker, and true scum.
3699320	3700320	Any association with him
3700320	3702320	must be seen as hostile
3702320	3704320	to the trans community as a whole,
3704320	3706320	let alone denial of nonbinary existence.
3706320	3708320	That's the line in the sand, folks.
3708320	3710320	Where do you stand?
3710320	3713320	And here we fucking are, dude.
3713320	3716320	Buck fucking Angel on ContraPoints.
3716320	3719320	Eat my entire ass.
3719320	3721320	What?
3721320	3722320	What?
3722320	3723320	This is Natalie.
3723320	3725320	Natalie is a transmedicalist.
3725320	3727320	This is Natalie's friend Lindsay.
3727320	3729320	Lindsay is a leftuber.
3729320	3731320	Natalie and Lindsay are still friends
3731320	3733320	because Natalie and Lindsay
3733320	3735320	are both cowards.
3735320	3737320	Leftuber's a griff.
3737320	3738320	Oh, and they made me the man.
3738320	3739320	The shade.
3739320	3741320	Issues that arose with
3741320	3743320	being in Contra's new video.
3743320	3745320	Her video on TERFs make no sense now.
3745320	3747320	Her video on trans trenders make no sense now.
3747320	3750320	You know, if your interpretation of why I cast Buck Angel
3750320	3752320	totally contradicts the videos
3752320	3754320	I've spent hundreds of hours making,
3754320	3756320	do you think maybe your interpretation could be wrong?
3756320	3758320	Apparently not.
3758320	3760320	Her apology is completely void.
3760320	3762320	Sends a message that she hates non-binary people.
3762320	3764320	She is reckless with her content.
3764320	3767320	Positives that arose from Buck Angel being in Contra's new video.
3767320	3772320	She, uh, has $400,000 this month from Patreon.
3773320	3775320	$400,000.
3775320	3777320	This number is completely made up.
3777320	3779320	Like, it is exponentially wrong.
3779320	3781320	$400,000.
3781320	3783320	$400,000 a month.
3783320	3784320	Hot take.
3784320	3786320	ContraPoints is the leftist PewDiePie.
3786320	3788320	Personally, I like to characterize her
3788320	3791320	as the blair-white wolf in leftist sheep's clothing.
3791320	3794320	Reminder that ContraPoints is a piece of shit
3794320	3797320	who still has not apologized for platforming truescum
3797320	3799320	and is actively taking their side.
3799320	3802320	Anyway, if you still support ContraPoints,
3802320	3804320	get the hell away from me.
3804320	3806320	Pee-pee-poo-poo, I'm ContraPoints
3806320	3808320	and I can't stop being a transmedicalist
3808320	3810320	and shitting myself in public.
3812320	3815320	Valid criticisms of marginalized people.
3815320	3817320	Fuck ContraPoints.
3817320	3818320	Fuck truescum.
3818320	3820320	ContraPoints is a truescum.
3820320	3822320	ContraPoints is a truescum.
3822320	3824320	ContraPoints is a truescum.
3824320	3826320	ContraPoints is a truescum.
3826320	3827320	ContraPoints is a truescum.
3827320	3829320	You know, when you repeat the same fucking sentence
3829320	3831320	over and over again, it does...
3831320	3833320	You know when you repeat the same sentence over and over again,
3833320	3836320	it actually doesn't get more persuasive.
3836320	3839320	In fact, it might get less persuasive.
3839320	3842320	Because true things usually only have to be said once.
3843320	3845320	If you still support ContraPoints,
3845320	3848320	then follow me immediately and never interact with me again.
3848320	3851320	In conclusion, fuck Natalie Nguyen
3851320	3853320	and fuck everything she has to say.
3864320	3866320	Okay, let's get started.
3866320	3870320	So, that was just a sample of hundreds and hundreds of tweets.
3870320	3872320	And all of this, let me remind you,
3872320	3875320	is over a ten second voiceover clip
3875320	3877320	in a 48 minute video
3877320	3879320	about a completely unrelated topic.
3879320	3881320	Like, how do you work?
3881320	3882320	How do you create
3882320	3884320	when a decision so trivial
3884320	3887320	can become the main event for weeks of your life?
3887320	3889320	And the tweets are just the beginning.
3889320	3890320	After that, there's the Reddit threads,
3890320	3891320	and the YouTube comments,
3891320	3893320	and the Facebook discourse,
3893320	3894320	and the Medium posts,
3894320	3895320	and the Newsweek article.
3895320	3897320	Opulence is a video
3897320	3899320	me and Theron spent hundreds of hours
3899320	3901320	carefully piecing together.
3901320	3902320	I think it's my best video.
3902320	3904320	And to have the response to it
3904320	3907320	completely overwhelmed by one minor casting decision
3907320	3910320	is heartbreaking and infuriating to me.
3910320	3912320	And it's left me with much less energy
3912320	3913320	to create new things.
3913320	3914320	But here's the thing,
3914320	3916320	people on Twitter saying mean things about me
3916320	3918320	is not the worst of it.
3918320	3919320	Not even close.
3919320	3922320	Like, I'm a politically opinionated trans woman
3922320	3924320	who publicly transitioned
3924320	3926320	while making anti-fascist content
3926320	3929320	on a notoriously right-wing platform.
3929320	3931320	Sweaty, I am so used to reading
3931320	3933320	mean things about myself online,
3933320	3936320	most of you probably can't even begin to imagine
3936320	3937320	how used to it I am.
3937320	3940320	And the way you psychologically survive in that situation
3940320	3942320	is you block the people and platforms
3942320	3943320	who are harassing you,
3943320	3944320	and you pay it no mind.
3944320	3947320	But there's some things you can't block.
3947320	3949320	And a big one is you can't block people
3949320	3951320	from going after your friends and colleagues.
3951320	3954320	And that is exactly what people did to me
3954320	3956320	at the height of the Buck Angel incident.
3956320	3957320	Lindsay Ellis,
3957320	3959320	Ollie from Philosophy Tube,
3959320	3960320	and Hbomberguy
3960320	3962320	all got inundated with tweets
3962320	3965320	demanding that they publicly disown me,
3965320	3968320	a person they've all been friends with for years,
3968320	3969320	or else.
3969320	3972320	In response to demands that she apologize,
3972320	3974320	Lindsay released a statement where she said,
3974320	3976320	I was not involved in Opulence.
3976320	3978320	My name was mentioned in it,
3978320	3980320	but I did not participate in the production.
3980320	3983320	Therefore, with regards to calls for me to apologize,
3983320	3987320	I have to ask, apologize for what?
3987320	3989320	There is only one logical answer.
3989320	3992320	Apologize for being friends with Natalie.
3992320	3994320	And here's a response to her statement.
3994320	3996320	I don't need to consider you my fucking friend
3996320	3999320	to disagree with beliefs you knowingly solicit
3999320	4000320	or allow on your platform.
4000320	4001320	Same with Contra.
4001320	4004320	It just means you're willing to allow awful ideas
4004320	4006320	to fester for the sake of financial gain,
4006320	4007320	which is fine,
4007320	4010320	but it makes you a piece of shit.
4010320	4012320	And here's a comment at Hbomberguy.
4012320	4014320	I doubt that you were going to read this,
4014320	4016320	but can you please just tell us your thoughts
4016320	4017320	on that whole situation
4017320	4021320	so we could at least know that you were on our side?
4021320	4024320	We don't want to have to cancel all of y'all
4024320	4026320	and cause BreadTube to go into a schism
4026320	4027320	as a result of this.
4027320	4028320	Thank you.
4028320	4031320	Nice YouTube channel you have there, friend.
4031320	4034320	Would be a shame if someone canceled it.
4035320	4037320	So fucking sinister.
4037320	4039320	Oli of PhilosophyTube released his own statement
4039320	4042320	affirming his support of non-binary people,
4042320	4043320	but adding,
4043320	4046320	Sadly, I've also been harassed, threatened, doxxed,
4046320	4048320	had my private life speculated on
4048320	4050320	and my loved ones insulted,
4050320	4051320	and recognizing the feelings of those
4051320	4054320	who kindly raised their concerns in a polite way,
4054320	4056320	I do not wish to legitimize the great many people
4056320	4058320	who use their hurt as a cover
4058320	4061320	for unacceptable toxic and abusive behavior.
4061320	4063320	And here are some responses to Oli.
4063320	4065320	As a non-binary fan of yours,
4065320	4067320	I'm disappointed in this non-apology.
4067320	4071320	Again, what exactly is he supposed to be apologizing for?
4071320	4073320	Ever having associated with me?
4073320	4077320	Things we are going to criticize Oli PhilosophyTube for.
4077320	4079320	Being a sniveling hypocritical piece of shit.
4079320	4081320	Refusing to listen to trans people.
4081320	4084320	Actively, openly, and repeatedly mocking the trans people
4084320	4086320	he refuses to listen to.
4086320	4087320	Thanks for the apology.
4087320	4089320	Now stop endorsing contrapoints.
4089320	4092320	Now keep in mind that what these Twitter people are doing
4092320	4096320	is demanding that cis people publicly condemn
4096320	4101320	a trans woman for loosely associating with another trans person.
4101320	4104320	Does that strike anyone else as wildly inappropriate?
4104320	4105320	Even Mia Mulder,
4105320	4108320	a trans woman who has never publicly associated with me,
4108320	4112320	got attacked because she tweeted a heart at Oli.
4112320	4115320	You know, after he made the post discussing being doxxed and threatened.
4115320	4118320	And just for that, she gets put on the enemy list.
4118320	4121320	I'm sad to say that Mia is on the list
4121320	4123320	of people that have stood by contrapoints
4123320	4126320	as she has continued to be a bigoted piece of shit.
4126320	4127320	To which Mia responds,
4127320	4129320	stood by contrapoints?
4129320	4130320	Jesus Christ.
4130320	4132320	No matter what I do, people call me out
4132320	4134320	and I'm not even related to the video
4134320	4135320	and I don't even know Natalie.
4135320	4137320	The chain of guilt by association
4137320	4139320	is so long and twisted,
4139320	4141320	I can barely even follow it.
4141320	4143320	So they're going after Mia,
4143320	4145320	who tweeted a heart at Oli,
4145320	4148320	who failed to condemn me
4148320	4151320	for my voiceover casting of Buck Angel,
4151320	4153320	who was retweeted by a TERF.
4153320	4156320	We're only missing a couple degrees of separation
4156320	4158320	before every living person on the planet Earth
4158320	4161320	is cancelled over the Buck Angel situation.
4161320	4163320	And several colleagues of mine, by the way,
4163320	4165320	Lindsay, Harry, Oli,
4165320	4167320	they all took a financial hit.
4167320	4169320	They've all lost some Patreon support.
4169320	4171320	One of Lindsay's former supporters
4171320	4174320	even demanded a $38 lifetime refund,
4174320	4175320	saying,
4175320	4176320	Dear Lindsay,
4176320	4178320	I'm sorry for being pushy,
4178320	4180320	but I really am going to be needing a refund.
4180320	4183320	I gave money to your operation
4183320	4184320	under the pretense
4184320	4186320	that you wouldn't do anything morally objectionable,
4186320	4188320	and supporting contrapoints
4188320	4190320	and blaming us for taking issue with that
4190320	4193320	is, in my opinion, amoral.
4193320	4194320	Please respond.
4194320	4196320	I hope she sent it to them in pennies.
4196320	4197320	So look,
4197320	4199320	I'm very grateful to my colleagues
4199320	4201320	for sticking by me through all this,
4201320	4204320	but I'm also aware that I'm becoming a burden
4204320	4206320	to anyone who associates with me.
4206320	4208320	I have no collaborators in this video.
4208320	4210320	I'm working on this totally alone
4210320	4214320	because I'm aware of how radioactive I am right now,
4214320	4216320	and I don't want to contaminate anyone else.
4216320	4219320	During the height of this most recent cancelling,
4219320	4222320	a creator I admire DMed me to let me know,
4222320	4224320	I cut the shout out to you in my last video
4224320	4225320	because I was nervous
4225320	4227320	to draw the ire of your detractors
4227320	4229320	who are getting genuinely scary,
4229320	4231320	but I wouldn't want you to think I was disavowing you,
4231320	4235320	regardless of how many people are asking me to.
4235320	4237320	Jesus Christ.
4237320	4240320	The situation here is that any cis person who defends me,
4240320	4242320	or even associates with me in any way,
4242320	4244320	will be labeled a transphobe.
4244320	4246320	Any binary trans person who associates with me
4246320	4248320	will be branded an enbyphobe.
4248320	4251320	And any non-binary people who associate with me
4251320	4253320	will be ostracized from their own community.
4253320	4254320	So on the internet,
4254320	4256320	I find myself increasingly alone.
4256320	4259320	I'm isolated by the harassment.
4259320	4261320	And that is ultimately the point.
4261320	4263320	To exile me from my community,
4263320	4264320	from any community.
4264320	4266320	And it's all because I refuse to participate
4266320	4269320	in doing exactly that to Buck Angel.
4269320	4271320	My experiences have made me so disillusioned
4271320	4273320	with the idea that social media callouts
4273320	4275320	can lead to any kind of justice
4275320	4278320	that I've essentially sworn off participating in them.
4278320	4281320	There's a fairly prominent figure in leftist politics
4281320	4284320	who I could absolutely hashtag immediately.
4284320	4286320	But I'm never going to do it.
4286320	4288320	Because I have no faith left
4288320	4291320	in the process of callout vigilante justice.
4291320	4294320	And I'm not saying I'm totally against meetooing people,
4294320	4295320	because I think in some cases,
4295320	4298320	it totally is the brave and admirable thing to do.
4298320	4299320	But in my case,
4299320	4301320	I feel like I just know too much
4301320	4304320	about the dark side of social media shaming
4304320	4306320	to ever want to participate in it again.
4306320	4308320	You know, I feel like the story would end up being
4308320	4309320	taken out of my control,
4309320	4312320	warped and twisted in all kinds of unpredictable ways.
4312320	4314320	It would end up just haunting me.
4314320	4316320	It would end up just haunting both me
4316320	4318320	and the person I'd be accusing,
4318320	4319320	which in this case,
4319320	4320320	honestly,
4320320	4322320	neither of us deserves.
4322320	4324320	So I'm just not willing to take that risk.
4324320	4326320	Except maybe in some very extreme situation,
4326320	4328320	which this just isn't.
4328320	4329320	It's not worth it.
4329320	4330320	And likewise,
4330320	4332320	when a mob is at my doorstep
4332320	4334320	demanding I condemn Buck Angel
4334320	4336320	to save myself from cancellation,
4336320	4337320	no!
4337320	4339320	I'm just not going to do that.
4339320	4341320	I'm a conscientious objector.
4341320	4343320	I'm willing to go to Twitter jail for this.
4343320	4345320	Take me away, boys.
4350320	4354320	If there's one thing I can't stand,
4354320	4357320	it's bread tube videos.
4357320	4359320	Part eight and a half.
4359320	4362320	The philosophy of being fucked in the ass.
4362320	4363320	Ugh.
4363320	4365320	I have done this to YouTube.
4365320	4366320	And I'm sorry.
4366320	4367320	So look,
4367320	4369320	canceling is not criticism.
4369320	4371320	It is not holding someone accountable.
4371320	4373320	It is an attack
4373320	4374320	on a human being.
4374320	4375320	In this video,
4375320	4376320	I use the word canceling
4376320	4378320	more or less synonymously
4378320	4380320	with what feminist Jo Freeman,
4380320	4381320	author of The Bitch Manifesto,
4381320	4382320	calls
4382320	4383320	trashing.
4383320	4384320	And I've linked her essay,
4384320	4386320	The Dark Side of Sisterhood,
4386320	4388320	in the description.
4388320	4389320	It was originally published
4389320	4391320	in Ms. Magazine in 1976,
4391320	4393320	but it is a perfect description
4393320	4396320	of what goes on on trans Twitter today.
4396320	4397320	It is not disagreement.
4397320	4398320	It is not conflict.
4398320	4400320	It is not opposition.
4400320	4402320	These are perfectly ordinary phenomena
4402320	4403320	which,
4403320	4404320	when engaged in mutually,
4404320	4405320	honestly,
4405320	4406320	and not excessively,
4406320	4408320	are necessary to keep an organism
4408320	4410320	or organization healthy and active.
4410320	4413320	Trashing is a particularly vicious form
4413320	4415320	of character assassination
4415320	4417320	which amounts to psychological rape.
4417320	4418320	It is manipulative,
4418320	4419320	dishonest,
4419320	4420320	and excessive.
4420320	4421320	It is occasionally disguised
4421320	4423320	by the rhetoric of honest conflict
4423320	4425320	or covered up by denying
4425320	4427320	that any disapproval exists at all.
4427320	4428320	But it is not done
4428320	4430320	to expose disagreements
4430320	4431320	or resolve differences.
4431320	4432320	It is done
4432320	4434320	to disparage and destroy.
4434320	4436320	Whatever methods are used,
4436320	4437320	trashing involves a violation
4437320	4438320	of one's integrity,
4438320	4440320	a declaration of one's worthlessness,
4440320	4443320	and an impugning of one's motives.
4443320	4444320	In effect,
4444320	4446320	what is attacked is not one's actions
4446320	4447320	or one's ideas,
4447320	4449320	but one's self.
4449320	4451320	And that's what distinguishes
4451320	4452320	trashing,
4452320	4453320	bullying,
4453320	4454320	or abuse
4454320	4455320	from criticism
4455320	4456320	or holding accountable.
4456320	4459320	Criticism attacks your actions or beliefs.
4459320	4461320	But when people are canceling me,
4461320	4462320	they're not bringing up
4462320	4463320	my problematic tweets
4463320	4464320	because they want me
4464320	4466320	to revise my beliefs.
4466320	4467320	No.
4467320	4468320	What they're doing
4468320	4469320	is accumulating evidence
4469320	4470320	to support the case
4470320	4472320	they've decided to make
4472320	4474320	that I am a horrible person
4474320	4476320	who must be shunned.
4476320	4477320	You know, the only sense
4477320	4478320	in which I am,
4478320	4479320	as they like to say,
4479320	4480320	the new Blair White,
4480320	4482320	is that I think I actually have now
4482320	4484320	snatched Vanessa's crown
4484320	4486320	as the most hated Tran
4486320	4487320	on Tran Twitter.
4487320	4490320	Vanessa, I'm trying to feud with you.
4490320	4491320	Feud with me, goddammit.
4491320	4493320	You can't have a one-sided feud.
4493320	4494320	I don't want to be one of those
4494320	4495320	trans YouTubers
4495320	4497320	that just drags other trans people all day
4497320	4498320	and they never respond.
4498320	4500320	That would be really pathetic.
4500320	4501320	The new Lacey Green.
4501320	4502320	That's the other one.
4502320	4504320	The newest in a series of women
4504320	4507320	you've decided to treat like supervillains.
4507320	4509320	Maybe reflect on that habit a little bit, hmm?
4509320	4512320	And supervillain is the right word.
4512320	4514320	Like, I'm the bad guy.
4514320	4515320	Duh.
4515320	4516320	I'm the enemy.
4516320	4518320	And what do you do with the enemy?
4518320	4520320	Well, you disavow,
4520320	4521320	disown,
4521320	4522320	deplatform,
4522320	4523320	and destroy.
4523320	4524320	As that one tweet put it,
4524320	4526320	that's the line in the sand, folks.
4526320	4527320	Where do you stand?
4527320	4529320	If you adequately demonstrate
4529320	4531320	your searing hatred of Natalie Wynne,
4531320	4533320	then you're safe and cool.
4533320	4535320	But if you don't,
4535320	4537320	you're on the wrong side of the line, sweaty.
4537320	4540320	And you, too, are now the enemy.
4540320	4542320	Cancel culture trope seven.
4542320	4543320	Dualism.
4543320	4545320	Certain ancient religions
4545320	4546320	teach their followers
4546320	4548320	to understand the cosmos
4548320	4549320	as a struggle
4549320	4550320	between light and dark,
4550320	4552320	good and evil.
4552320	4553320	And cancel culture
4553320	4555320	does more or less the same thing.
4555320	4557320	It's binary thinking.
4557320	4558320	People are either good
4558320	4559320	or they're bad.
4559320	4560320	And to add to that,
4560320	4561320	essentialism.
4561320	4564320	If a person says or does a bad thing,
4564320	4565320	we should interpret that
4565320	4567320	as the mask slipping,
4567320	4568320	as a momentary glimpse
4568320	4570320	of their essential wickedness.
4570320	4572320	And anyone who wants to remain good
4572320	4573320	had better be willing
4573320	4575320	to publicly condemn
4575320	4576320	anyone the community
4576320	4578320	has decided is bad.
4578320	4579320	There really is something
4579320	4580320	dystopian about this.
4580320	4581320	You have to be willing
4581320	4583320	to accuse other people
4583320	4585320	to prove your own innocence.
4585320	4587320	That's the line in the sand, folks.
4587320	4588320	Where do you stand?
4588320	4590320	In the most extreme version of this,
4590320	4592320	all bad people are equally bad.
4592320	4594320	So collaborating with true scum
4594320	4596320	means you may as well be true scum.
4596320	4597320	And of course,
4597320	4598320	being true scum
4598320	4600320	is tantamount to being a TERF.
4600320	4601320	And on trans Twitter,
4601320	4603320	it is a known fact
4603320	4604320	that TERFs
4604320	4605320	are Nazis.
4605320	4607320	And this implies that Nazis,
4607320	4608320	TERFs,
4608320	4609320	true scum,
4609320	4610320	people who associate
4610320	4611320	with true scum,
4611320	4612320	people who fail to condemn
4612320	4613320	people who associate
4613320	4614320	with true scum,
4614320	4616320	people who offer emotional support
4616320	4617320	to people who fail to condemn
4617320	4618320	people who associate
4618320	4619320	with true scum,
4619320	4621320	all of them must be treated
4621320	4622320	the same way.
4622320	4623320	De-platform her
4623320	4624320	just like every other racist,
4624320	4625320	sexist,
4625320	4627320	bigoted content creator.
4627320	4629320	A fully wound backhand
4629320	4630320	to the mouth.
4630320	4631320	I recently read a book
4631320	4632320	by Sarah Schulman
4632320	4634320	called Conflict Is Not Abuse.
4634320	4635320	Overstating harm,
4635320	4636320	community responsibility,
4636320	4638320	and the duty of repair.
4638320	4639320	Basically,
4639320	4640320	Schulman's argument
4640320	4642320	is that in various contexts,
4642320	4643320	from romantic relationships
4643320	4645320	to community infighting
4645320	4647320	to international politics,
4647320	4649320	the overstatement of harm
4649320	4651320	is used as a justification
4651320	4652320	for cruelty
4652320	4654320	and for escalating conflict.
4654320	4655320	So for example,
4655320	4656320	and this is my example,
4656320	4657320	not Schulman's,
4657320	4659320	TERFs fixate
4659320	4661320	on the exaggerated danger
4661320	4663320	that trans women supposedly pose
4663320	4664320	to cis women.
4664320	4665320	And in very classic
4665320	4666320	overstatement of harm,
4666320	4668320	they'll describe everything
4668320	4669320	they don't like
4669320	4670320	as rape.
4670320	4671320	Trans women entering
4671320	4672320	women's spaces
4672320	4673320	is rape.
4673320	4674320	Trans women existing,
4674320	4675320	Janice Raymond,
4675320	4676320	is rape.
4676320	4677320	And then they use
4677320	4678320	that exaggerated harm
4678320	4679320	as a justification
4679320	4681320	to retaliate against them,
4681320	4684320	to dox and harass and shun.
4684320	4685320	Well, the same kind of logic
4685320	4686320	is used to justify
4686320	4687320	abusive behavior
4687320	4689320	within the trans community.
4689320	4690320	The dualistic thinking,
4690320	4692320	the essentialism,
4692320	4693320	the pseudo-moralism.
4693320	4694320	All of this allows people
4694320	4695320	on Twitter
4695320	4696320	to treat me
4696320	4698320	in an obviously abusive way,
4698320	4700320	all the while feeling
4700320	4702320	like they're doing the right thing
4702320	4703320	because they're attacking
4703320	4704320	the enemy.
4704320	4705320	And I realize that some people
4705320	4706320	will say that I'm the one
4706320	4708320	who's overstating harm
4708320	4709320	to evade criticism.
4709320	4710320	Well look,
4710320	4711320	you've seen the tweets,
4711320	4712320	the furious demands
4712320	4713320	for me to be exiled,
4713320	4715320	the doxing and threatening
4715320	4716320	and ordering around
4716320	4717320	of my colleagues,
4717320	4718320	the attempts to isolate me
4718320	4719320	from my community,
4719320	4720320	the attacks not on my actions
4720320	4722320	but on who I am as a person.
4722320	4723320	There's not really anything
4723320	4724320	ambiguous about this,
4724320	4726320	it's just abuse.
4726320	4727320	But I don't think it feels
4727320	4728320	like abuse to the people
4728320	4729320	who are doing it.
4729320	4732320	They feel like they're punching up
4732320	4735320	because I'm a celebrity
4735320	4736320	with a platform
4736320	4738320	and lots of Twitter followers.
4738320	4740320	And it's true that I do have more power
4740320	4742320	than any of them individually.
4742320	4744320	But as a collective,
4744320	4746320	they have a terrifying power
4746320	4748320	that they don't seem to be aware of
4748320	4749320	as individuals.
4749320	4751320	As John Ronson,
4751320	4752320	author of a great book
4752320	4753320	on public shaming put it,
4753320	4754320	I suppose that when
4754320	4755320	shamings are delivered
4755320	4756320	like remotely administered
4756320	4757320	drone strikes,
4757320	4758320	nobody needs to think
4758320	4759320	about how ferocious
4759320	4761320	our collective power might be.
4761320	4763320	The snowflake never needs
4763320	4764320	to feel responsible
4764320	4765320	for the avalanche.
4765320	4766320	And that's how you get
4766320	4767320	these situations
4767320	4768320	where you have hundreds
4768320	4770320	of people endlessly bashing
4770320	4771320	someone who's already
4771320	4773320	been knocked to the ground
4773320	4774320	and feeling all the while
4774320	4776320	like they're punching up.
4776320	4777320	You know, there's actually
4777320	4779320	a kind of power and safety
4779320	4781320	in anonymity and obscurity.
4781320	4782320	And there are many ways
4782320	4784320	that being a public figure
4784320	4786320	makes you really vulnerable.
4786320	4787320	For example, you're more vulnerable
4787320	4790320	to doxing, stalking, and harassment
4790320	4792320	on a scale that most people
4792320	4794320	probably can't even imagine.
4794320	4795320	You're vulnerable to having
4795320	4798320	your reputation permanently degraded
4798320	4800320	in a way that people who are
4800320	4801320	posting anonymously
4801320	4802320	or pseudonymously
4802320	4804320	are pretty much invulnerable to.
4804320	4805320	And a lot of the people
4805320	4806320	who are attacking me,
4806320	4808320	they're not pausing to self-reflect.
4808320	4810320	They're not holding themselves
4810320	4811320	accountable for the consequences
4811320	4813320	of their actions.
4813320	4814320	They're just venting
4814320	4816320	their unfiltered rage.
4816320	4818320	But in response to these attacks,
4818320	4820320	I, as a powerful person
4820320	4821320	with a platform,
4821320	4823320	I'm not allowed to react
4823320	4824320	like a human being.
4824320	4826320	I'm not allowed to get angry.
4826320	4827320	I'm not allowed to show pain.
4827320	4829320	I'm not allowed to get defensive.
4829320	4830320	I'm not allowed to lash out.
4830320	4832320	All I'm allowed to do is
4832320	4834320	go totally numb on the inside
4834320	4836320	as I try to frantically calculate
4836320	4839320	the ideal public relations response
4839320	4840320	that pays due deference
4840320	4841320	to the valid concerns
4841320	4843320	of these poor marginalized people,
4843320	4845320	all the while ignoring
4845320	4847320	the tsunami of verbal abuse
4847320	4848320	that's crashing over me.
4848320	4850320	You know, people on Twitter,
4850320	4852320	they don't try to persuade me
4852320	4853320	like I'm a human being.
4853320	4855320	They order me around.
4855320	4856320	They tell me what to believe.
4856320	4858320	They demand that I say
4858320	4860320	exactly what they want me to say
4860320	4861320	or else.
4861320	4863320	It's extremely objectifying.
4863320	4865320	They don't treat me like a person
4865320	4867320	with my own opinions and feelings.
4867320	4868320	They treat me as this like
4868320	4869320	brand
4869320	4871320	of moral commodity
4871320	4873320	to be consumed or denounced.
4873320	4875320	And this is all terribly ironic
4875320	4877320	because of the conflicting demand
4877320	4879320	that creators be authentic
4879320	4880320	all the time.
4880320	4881320	One thing that always frustrates me
4881320	4883320	about these situations
4883320	4884320	is there's this demand
4884320	4887320	that you apologize instantly
4887320	4888320	and there's this perception
4888320	4890320	that a fast apology
4890320	4892320	is more sincere than a delayed one.
4892320	4893320	But in fact,
4893320	4894320	the opposite is true.
4894320	4896320	It takes longer than a couple hours
4896320	4897320	to cool down,
4897320	4898320	lower your defenses,
4898320	4900320	listen,
4900320	4901320	learn,
4901320	4902320	grow,
4902320	4903320	seriously reflect
4903320	4904320	on what you may have done
4904320	4905320	or said that was wrong.
4905320	4907320	That can take days
4907320	4908320	or weeks
4908320	4909320	or months.
4909320	4911320	I had to do my October AMA stream
4911320	4912320	for Patreon
4912320	4914320	and at the beginning of the stream,
4914320	4916320	I gave my emotional
4916320	4917320	half-formed reaction
4917320	4920320	to the Buck Angel situation.
4920320	4922320	And some traitor
4922320	4924320	on my Patreon
4924320	4926320	transcribed
4926320	4927320	that part of the stream
4927320	4929320	and disseminated it on Twitter
4929320	4930320	just to instigate
4930320	4931320	another round of canceling.
4931320	4932320	You're not allowed a chance
4932320	4934320	to think or feel.
4934320	4936320	And because supposedly
4936320	4937320	the best thing to do
4937320	4938320	from a PR perspective
4938320	4940320	is to apologize immediately,
4940320	4941320	canceling produces
4941320	4943320	a lot of insincere
4943320	4944320	bullshit apologies
4944320	4946320	from people who haven't in fact
4946320	4947320	learned anything.
4947320	4948320	And I think most people
4948320	4949320	are aware of that.
4949320	4950320	In fact,
4950320	4951320	I think the demand
4951320	4953320	for an apology itself
4953320	4954320	is often insincere.
4954320	4956320	If you're being canceled
4956320	4958320	rather than criticized,
4958320	4960320	then the line in the sand
4960320	4961320	has been drawn.
4961320	4962320	You and all your kin
4962320	4963320	have been declared
4963320	4964320	the enemy.
4964320	4966320	Apologize to Twitter.
4966320	4967320	At this point,
4967320	4968320	I may as well apologize
4968320	4969320	to 4chan.
4969320	4970320	Dear 4chan,
4970320	4972320	I am super fucking sorry
4972320	4973320	I called you
4973320	4975320	thin-wristed otaku shit weasels
4975320	4976320	who like looking at pictures
4976320	4977320	of little girls.
4977320	4978320	I have been trying
4978320	4979320	to educate myself
4979320	4981320	and learn from my mistakes
4981320	4982320	and I now realize
4982320	4984320	that's only 70% of you.
4984320	4985320	Like, once you're canceled,
4985320	4987320	you can really do no right.
4987320	4988320	If you apologize,
4988320	4990320	the apology will be declared
4990320	4991320	a manipulative attempt
4991320	4992320	to save face
4992320	4993320	and in fact,
4993320	4994320	it will be used
4994320	4995320	as further evidence
4995320	4996320	of what a Machiavellian
4996320	4998320	psychopath you really are.
4998320	4999320	If you try to explain
4999320	5000320	or defend yourself,
5000320	5001320	I mean, first of all,
5001320	5002320	you'll almost certainly
5002320	5003320	dig yourself in deeper.
5003320	5004320	But even if you're
5004320	5006320	articulate and correct,
5006320	5007320	you'll still be seen
5007320	5008320	as unable to take criticism
5008320	5010320	and as ignoring the hurt
5010320	5011320	of marginalized people.
5011320	5013320	And if you just go silent,
5013320	5014320	you'll be seen as a coward
5014320	5016320	fleeing accountability.
5016320	5017320	Even though there's
5017320	5018320	lots of reasons
5018320	5019320	why you might go silent.
5019320	5020320	Maybe you're taking
5020320	5021320	a few days away
5021320	5022320	from social media
5022320	5023320	to try to cool down
5023320	5024320	and think clearly.
5024320	5025320	Or maybe,
5025320	5026320	you're so overwhelmed
5026320	5027320	by the harassment
5027320	5029320	that you've just shut down.
5034320	5036320	Let's do shots.
5036320	5037320	Who wants to do a shot with me?
5037320	5038320	Do you want to do a shot with me?
5038320	5040320	Let's do a shot.
5040320	5042320	A tequila shot is my favorite.
5042320	5043320	I like the whole
5043320	5046320	salt, tequila, lime ritual.
5046320	5049320	It's just very satisfying to me.
5049320	5052320	It's the end of that bottle.
5052320	5053320	Okay.
5053320	5055320	Let's get started.
5061320	5062320	You feel warm right away.
5062320	5063320	You know that feeling
5063320	5064320	where it's like,
5064320	5067320	oh, hey, how are you, happiness?
5067320	5069320	Hey, how are you?
5069320	5071320	Feeling that life is worth living?
5071320	5072320	It's a good moment.
5072320	5073320	You're like, oh, this is good.
5073320	5074320	This is okay.
5074320	5075320	This is gonna be okay.
5075320	5076320	I can get through this.
5076320	5077320	It's how it starts.
5077320	5078320	Watch out for that.
5078320	5079320	So look,
5079320	5080320	I really don't like
5080320	5081320	to represent myself
5081320	5082320	as a victim.
5082320	5084320	That's not really a narrative
5084320	5086320	that I identify with.
5086320	5087320	But for the purposes
5087320	5088320	of communicating
5088320	5090320	what effect canceling has,
5090320	5092320	I feel like I should say something
5092320	5094320	about the pain.
5094320	5095320	Much of the happiness
5095320	5097320	that you might expect
5097320	5098320	to come along with success
5098320	5101320	has been taken away from me
5101320	5103320	by this constant need
5103320	5105320	and fury that surrounds me.
5105320	5107320	Try to think about this rationally.
5107320	5109320	I'm a Libra Sun, Pisces Moon.
5109320	5111320	Being canceled is hell for me.
5111320	5112320	You know,
5112320	5114320	I want to be liked by everyone.
5114320	5117320	And I'm starting to think
5117320	5119320	I might be in the wrong career for that.
5119320	5120320	In a way,
5120320	5122320	leftist Twitter finally accomplished
5122320	5125320	what 4chan, Nazis, stalkers, and TERFs
5125320	5127320	have been trying and failing to do to me
5127320	5128320	for years.
5128320	5130320	They've made Twitter into a platform
5130320	5132320	so hostile to my existence
5132320	5134320	that I've decided to leave it forever.
5134320	5136320	And they demoralized me to the point
5136320	5138320	I could barely get out of bed for a month.
5138320	5140320	And I know that sounds really melodramatic,
5140320	5143320	but I'm just trying to be honest with you
5143320	5146320	about what a melodramatic person I am.
5146320	5148320	I find I have trouble convincing people
5148320	5149320	of the severity of the pain
5149320	5151320	that being canceled causes
5151320	5154320	because I think it's just hard to imagine
5154320	5156320	if you haven't been through it yourself.
5156320	5157320	And I don't know a more succinct way
5157320	5158320	to convey it to you
5158320	5160320	than by telling you that
5160320	5161320	in the last few years,
5161320	5163320	I've been harassed by Nazis,
5163320	5164320	I've been harassed by TERFs,
5164320	5165320	I've been stalked,
5165320	5166320	I've been doxxed,
5166320	5167320	I've been threatened,
5167320	5169320	I've been sexually assaulted.
5169320	5171320	And the pain of being canceled,
5171320	5172320	of being totally trashed
5172320	5175320	by other trans people online for years,
5175320	5177320	has been more difficult for me to cope with
5177320	5179320	than all the rest of it combined.
5179320	5181320	Joe Freeman actually describes how I feel
5181320	5183320	better than I think I can describe it myself.
5183320	5185320	I was one of the first in the country,
5185320	5187320	perhaps the first in Chicago,
5187320	5188320	to have my character,
5188320	5189320	my commitment,
5189320	5190320	and my very self attacked
5190320	5192320	in such a way by movement women
5192320	5194320	that it left me torn in little pieces
5194320	5196320	and unable to function.
5196320	5197320	It took me years to recover,
5197320	5198320	and even today the wounds
5198320	5199320	have not entirely healed.
5199320	5201320	This attack is accomplished
5201320	5202320	by making you feel
5202320	5203320	that your very existence
5203320	5205320	is inimical to the movement
5205320	5207320	and that nothing can change this
5207320	5209320	short of ceasing to exist.
5209320	5210320	These feelings are reinforced
5210320	5212320	when you are isolated from your friends
5212320	5213320	as they become convinced
5213320	5215320	that their association with you
5215320	5217320	is similarly inimical to the movement
5217320	5218320	and to themselves.
5218320	5219320	Any support of you
5219320	5220320	will taint them.
5220320	5222320	Eventually all your colleagues join in
5222320	5224320	in a chorus of condemnation
5224320	5225320	which cannot be silenced
5225320	5227320	and you are reduced to a mere parody
5227320	5229320	of your previous self.
5229320	5232320	Yeah, that just about sums it up.
5232320	5233320	Now as it happens,
5233320	5234320	I am going to survive this
5234320	5237320	because I have very deliberately built
5237320	5239320	a support network that will be there for me
5239320	5243320	regardless of what online trans communities say.
5243320	5245320	And I have very deliberately done that
5245320	5248320	because early in my transition back in 2017
5248320	5251320	I relied very heavily
5251320	5253320	on the online leftist trans community
5253320	5255320	for all kinds of emotional support.
5255320	5257320	You know, when you're early in transition
5257320	5259320	I mean, it just sucks.
5259320	5261320	You feel like the whole world is against you.
5261320	5262320	And I talked about this a little bit
5262320	5264320	in my last video, you know,
5264320	5265320	feeling like a freak show
5265320	5266320	walking down the street.
5266320	5267320	And even if you're lucky enough
5267320	5269320	to have a supportive family,
5269320	5271320	like, it usually still is going to take them
5271320	5272320	a while to come around.
5272320	5273320	At first they don't get it.
5273320	5275320	They say things to you like,
5275320	5277320	aren't you worried you'll regret this?
5277320	5279320	And like, they struggle with your name and pronouns,
5279320	5280320	which is understandable.
5280320	5282320	But at the same time,
5282320	5284320	it makes you feel like you're not being seen
5284320	5285320	for who you are.
5285320	5287320	So you need a kind of second family
5287320	5289320	that understands how you're feeling
5289320	5291320	and acts happy about your transition
5291320	5292320	and validates your gender.
5292320	5295320	And for the first couple months of my transition,
5295320	5299320	I found that in this world of online transgender leftism.
5299320	5301320	Well, that didn't last long because,
5301320	5302320	well, I was what,
5302320	5304320	two months into my transition when
5304320	5306320	first I did an interview with the journalist
5306320	5307320	Jessie Single,
5307320	5309320	and then I agreed to do a debate
5309320	5310320	with Theron and Vanessa.
5310320	5311320	So that's a long story,
5311320	5312320	but in short,
5312320	5314320	I associated with a string of people
5314320	5317320	that trans Twitter considers the enemy.
5317320	5319320	And trans Twitter tore me apart over this.
5319320	5321320	And it completely broke my heart
5321320	5324320	because I was really leaning
5324320	5327320	on basically emotional support
5327320	5328320	from strangers online,
5328320	5330320	which seems really stupid in retrospect.
5330320	5332320	And after they turned against me,
5332320	5333320	I decided one,
5333320	5334320	that I was never going to rely
5334320	5335320	on this group of people again.
5335320	5336320	And two,
5336320	5339320	that I was going to have to find acceptance elsewhere.
5339320	5340320	And in retrospect,
5340320	5342320	I think this actually may have been good for me
5342320	5343320	in a roundabout way
5343320	5345320	because I was kicked out of the safe space
5345320	5347320	and I dropped that mentality.
5347320	5348320	And so basically,
5348320	5350320	I was thrown into the deep end of reality
5350320	5351320	and forced to sink or swim.
5351320	5353320	And I don't know if my transition
5353320	5355320	or my channel would be where they are today
5355320	5357320	if it hadn't been for that trial by fire.
5357320	5358320	Are we swimming through fire
5358320	5360320	or are we mixing metaphors?
5360320	5364320	The point is I'm more armored against canceling
5364320	5365320	than I was two years ago.
5365320	5367320	And the reason why is I have acquired
5367320	5369320	a certain level of privilege and security
5369320	5371320	and independence from any one community
5371320	5373320	so that if one community cancels me,
5373320	5375320	I still have somewhere else to go.
5375320	5376320	You know,
5376320	5378320	the people who are most vulnerable to cancel culture
5378320	5380320	are not white guy comedians.
5380320	5381320	They're not James Charles.
5381320	5382320	They're not me.
5382320	5384320	They are marginalized people
5384320	5386320	who feel like they have nowhere else to go
5386320	5387320	when they're rejected by their community.
5387320	5390320	That means struggling trans people
5390320	5391320	with a few hundred Twitter followers.
5391320	5393320	It means a lot of sex workers.
5393320	5394320	It means people
5394320	5397320	who totally rely on activist circles
5397320	5399320	for emotional and material support.
5399320	5401320	I'll quote Joe Freeman one more time.
5401320	5402320	I had survived my youth
5402320	5404320	because I had never given anyone
5404320	5406320	or any group the right to judge me.
5406320	5408320	That right I had reserved to myself.
5408320	5410320	But the movement seduced me
5410320	5412320	by its sweet promise of sisterhood.
5412320	5414320	It claimed to provide a haven
5414320	5416320	from the ravages of a sexist society,
5416320	5418320	a place where one would be understood.
5418320	5421320	It was my very need for feminism and feminists
5421320	5423320	that made me vulnerable.
5423320	5426320	I gave the movement the right to judge me
5426320	5427320	because I trusted it.
5427320	5429320	And when it judged me worthless,
5429320	5431320	I accepted that judgment.
5431320	5433320	There's a really irritating point
5433320	5435320	that people on the left like to make that goes,
5435320	5438320	well, canceling doesn't really end anyone's career.
5438320	5440320	Canceled people usually get a new job
5440320	5441320	or keep their platform.
5441320	5444320	So I guess it's not really that bad, huh?
5444320	5445320	I think people say this
5445320	5448320	because they're trying to mitigate any sense of guilt
5448320	5450320	they might feel about how they're treating people
5450320	5452320	because it's a really stupid argument.
5452320	5454320	There's lots of things that don't end your life
5454320	5455320	that are still terrible.
5455320	5457320	But also, there's cases where canceling
5457320	5459320	has ended someone's life.
5459320	5461320	On December 5th, 2017,
5461320	5463320	a porn star named August Ames
5463320	5465320	killed herself by hanging in a public park
5465320	5467320	after being canceled on Twitter
5467320	5469320	over a homophobic tweet.
5469320	5471320	On December 3rd, she tweeted,
5471320	5473320	Whichever lady is replacing me tomorrow
5473320	5474320	for erotica x news,
5474320	5476320	you're shooting with a guy who has shot gay porn
5476320	5477320	just to let you know.
5477320	5479320	BS is all I can say, shrug.
5479320	5481320	Do agents really not care about who they're representing?
5481320	5484320	LA Direct, I do my homework for my body.
5484320	5486320	So I've never worked in porn,
5486320	5488320	so I can't really tell you what the norms are
5488320	5492320	around women working with men who have done gay porn.
5492320	5494320	But the tweet certainly sounds homophobic to me,
5494320	5496320	and that seemed to be the consensus
5496320	5498320	of other industry people on Twitter.
5498320	5499320	So Twitter did its thing.
5499320	5502320	People in August's community called her a homophobe
5502320	5503320	and lashed out at her.
5503320	5504320	And as always happens,
5504320	5506320	plenty of passersby jumped in
5506320	5508320	to throw tomatoes at the woman in the stocks.
5508320	5509320	Over the next few days,
5509320	5511320	August tweeted several more times,
5511320	5513320	going through the usual stages that you go through
5513320	5514320	when you're being canceled.
5514320	5516320	First, she defended herself.
5516320	5518320	She claimed most other women in the industry
5518320	5519320	feel the same as her.
5519320	5521320	Then she said she's bisexual,
5521320	5523320	and therefore she couldn't be homophobic.
5523320	5525320	Then she said, fine, August will be fake
5525320	5526320	and not have opinions then.
5526320	5528320	Then she started bemoaning how mean Twitter is.
5528320	5529320	And she got really defensive
5529320	5531320	about her right to choose who she has sex with.
5531320	5534320	And she lashed out at the people attacking her.
5534320	5536320	And then in her final tweet,
5536320	5538320	she just said, fuck y'all,
5538320	5540320	and went to the park that night and killed herself.
5541320	5543320	This is all so familiar to me.
5543320	5545320	I feel like I'm able to relive with her
5545320	5547320	each stage of this emotional process.
5547320	5548320	There's that first moment
5548320	5550320	when you realize the outrage is beginning
5550320	5552320	and you get that sinking feeling in your stomach.
5552320	5555320	And then the anger, feeling misunderstood.
5555320	5557320	And then the bargaining, the fear,
5557320	5559320	and finally the shame and the despair.
5559320	5560320	And here's the thing,
5560320	5562320	I totally agree with her critics
5562320	5564320	that her tweet was bad.
5564320	5566320	Of course she has the right to say no for any reason,
5566320	5570320	but she publicly expressed this in a homophobic way.
5570320	5574320	But she was still a person who deserves to live.
5574320	5575320	And I think there's gotta be a better way
5575320	5577320	to deal with these situations
5577320	5580320	than just trashing someone until they kill themselves.
5580320	5581320	And I know it's never as simple
5581320	5583320	as Twitter made her kill herself.
5583320	5586320	There's always other things going on in the background.
5586320	5587320	But the point I'm making is,
5587320	5590320	canceling is more dangerous to marginalized people
5590320	5593320	because marginalized people generally have more things
5593320	5595320	going on in the background.
5595320	5598320	John Ronson did an investigative podcast about her death
5598320	5600320	and it goes into how she was saved
5600320	5603320	and sexually abused as a child, abandoned by her father.
5603320	5604320	She was living with a boyfriend
5604320	5606320	she was kind of emotionally detached from.
5606320	5607320	And a few weeks earlier,
5607320	5608320	she'd filmed a scene with a guy
5608320	5611320	who was unnecessarily rough and mean
5611320	5612320	and who mistreated her.
5612320	5614320	So she was kind of traumatized by that.
5614320	5616320	And so she was kind of on edge
5616320	5618320	and really defensive about who she worked with
5618320	5619320	when she was tweeting.
5619320	5621320	Then the backlash happened.
5621320	5624320	And since she had no other support network,
5624320	5626320	she probably felt like the only community she had
5626320	5627320	turned against her.
5627320	5629320	And that's a really painful feeling.
5629320	5632320	She must have felt so despised.
5632320	5635320	Which is how I've felt for the last two months.
5635320	5639320	I feel despised and burdensome.
5639320	5642320	And I can imagine how a person who feels that way
5642320	5644320	could have an impulsive couple hours
5644320	5647320	where they think their best option is suicide.
5647320	5648320	I mean, I can more than imagine it
5648320	5650320	because I've been there myself.
5650320	5651320	And I'm still here
5651320	5652320	because at those moments,
5652320	5655320	I've been with good friends who took care of me.
5655320	5656320	And by friends,
5656320	5658320	I do mean Xanax.
5658320	5661320	But I've also survived because
5661320	5663320	there's a lot of people on the internet
5663320	5665320	who'd be very entertained if I killed myself.
5665320	5668320	And I simply refuse to give them the satisfaction.
5668320	5669320	Oh no, bitch.
5669320	5672320	I intend to live as long as possible out of sheer spite.
5672320	5674320	I mean, who needs a guardian angel
5674320	5676320	when you can make it through Christmas after Christmas
5676320	5678320	on the fumes of total contempt?
5678320	5680320	What I'm really trying to say is,
5680320	5683320	Merry Christmas, you goddamn assholes.
5688320	5704320	Oh, holy night.
5704320	5711320	The stars are brightly shining.
5711320	5714320	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
5714320	5717320	Meow, meow, meow, meow.
5717320	5718320	Meow.
5718320	5719320	Meow, meow.
5719320	5722320	To get my lesbian pliers out again.
5728320	5731320	Have a super fucking happy New Year, George.
5731320	5734320	How am I gonna get this bathtub out of my apartment?
5734320	5736320	Anyone in Baltimore want a bathtub?
5736320	5738320	Leave a comment if you want a bathtub.
5738320	5740320	All right, I need to take a deep breath
5740320	5741320	because let's be honest,
5741320	5742320	I'm about one crack away
5742320	5745320	from attacking my own Twitter followers with an umbrella.
5745320	5747320	I am about one breakdown away
5747320	5748320	from going on a rampage
5748320	5750320	and making a suit out of women's skin.
5750320	5751320	Just kidding.
5751320	5752320	I would never do that.
5752320	5753320	Though on a bad skin day,
5753320	5755320	I've given it serious consideration.
5755320	5757320	Oh, I'll be fine.
5757320	5758320	I've gotta sober up anyway
5758320	5761320	because I'm having more plastic surgery in a couple days.
5761320	5763320	And plastic surgery,
5763320	5766320	that's about the only thing holding me together at this point.
5766320	5767320	What?
5767320	5768320	YouTubing?
5768320	5769320	This is a healthy profession.
5769320	5771320	This is great.
5771320	5772320	Anyone want my job?
5772320	5774320	Step right up.
5774320	5775320	All you have to do is make informative
5775320	5776320	and entertaining videos
5776320	5778320	about extremely controversial topics
5778320	5779320	while, of course,
5779320	5781320	representing the full range of experiences
5781320	5783320	in the LGBTQIAA plus spectrum
5783320	5786320	and being perfectly woke and irreverently funny.
5786320	5787320	Well, go on.
5787320	5789320	I'm waiting to be entertained.
5789320	5790320	Feed me, mother.
5790320	5791320	Oh, don't mind me.
5791320	5792320	I'll just sit back
5792320	5794320	and pour another glass of wine.
5794320	5795320	Oh, and I will, of course,
5795320	5797320	be obsessively scrutinizing
5797320	5798320	every word you say
5798320	5800320	for any hint of moral transgression
5800320	5801320	as well as critiquing your look,
5801320	5803320	you third-rate cross-dresser.
5803320	5804320	Zero out of ten.
5804320	5805320	Get off my stage.
5805320	5807320	He successfully spilled that everywhere.
5807320	5808320	It's good.
5808320	5810320	I do still want to talk about
5810320	5811320	why people cancel
5811320	5812320	and the effect that it's having,
5812320	5814320	but it looks like there's gonna have to be
5814320	5815320	a part two gorge
5815320	5817320	because I have hit my limit.
5817320	5819320	So why don't we all cut our losses
5819320	5821320	and try again in 2020, hm?
5821320	5822320	I realize that people on Twitter
5822320	5824320	aren't actually gonna watch this video.
5824320	5826320	They're just gonna make fun of the title
5826320	5827320	and how long it is.
5827320	5828320	Which, fair enough,
5828320	5829320	but they're the ones
5829320	5830320	whose accusations against me
5830320	5832320	are so numerous and convoluted
5832320	5834320	it required a feature-length film
5834320	5835320	to respond to.
5835320	5836320	But yeah, they're gonna see the title
5836320	5837320	and they're gonna transcribe
5837320	5839320	quotes out of context
5839320	5840320	and they're gonna say
5840320	5841320	I'm a fascist,
5841320	5842320	I'm a TERF,
5842320	5843320	I'm true scum,
5843320	5844320	I'm the new Blair White,
5844320	5845320	I'm the new Lacey Green,
5845320	5846320	I'm a cis bootlicker,
5846320	5848320	I'm an enlightened centrist,
5848320	5849320	I'm a shitlib,
5849320	5850320	I'm alt-right,
5850320	5851320	I'm a heartless grifter
5851320	5852320	raking in millions of dollars
5852320	5854320	over the bodies of dead trans women.
5854320	5855320	Mask off.
5855320	5856320	Yikes.
5856320	5857320	This ain't it, chief.
5857320	5858320	Friendly reminder
5858320	5860320	that this isn't a good look.
5860320	5862320	Maybe don't be a cis bootlicker?
5862320	5863320	Disappointing.
5863320	5864320	But there's something
5864320	5865320	about them saying
5865320	5866320	all those things already
5866320	5867320	so I'm inoculated.
5867320	5868320	See, their mistake
5868320	5869320	was completely breaking my spirit.
5869320	5870320	They should have left
5870320	5871320	a little piece intact.
5871320	5872320	But it's good.
5872320	5873320	It's good.
5873320	5874320	It's good.
5874320	5875320	Because, basically,
5875320	5877320	my survival from here on out
5877320	5879320	hinges on my ability
5879320	5881320	to not care at all
5881320	5883320	what people say about me online.
5883320	5885320	So...
5887320	5889320	here's to not giving a fuck.
5894320	5895320	And to that,
5895320	5896320	I hope,
5896320	5897320	is to oxygenate
5897320	5898320	enough for the next
5898320	5899320	time we meet.
5899320	5900320	Mew men.
5900320	5901320	Sir,
5901320	5902320	but well,

5912320	5913320	shower.
