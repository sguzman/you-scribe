00:00.000 --> 00:20.060
All right, children. It's a new decade. It's time to face the facts. How do I put this

00:20.060 --> 00:27.760
delicately? Your humble hostess is a total les. Shame. You're probably worried this

00:27.760 --> 00:34.100
is a coming out video, and I'm sorry to tell you that it is, but oh, it's so much worse

00:34.100 --> 00:40.080
than just that. You know, one, coming out may be regarded as a misfortune. Two, looks

00:40.080 --> 00:44.660
like carelessness. And three, well, at that point, you're just doing it for attention.

00:44.980 --> 00:50.380
And I do love attention. I want to be very clear about that, but I also happen to be

00:50.380 --> 00:55.300
gay. Some gay people love attention. It's been known to happen. So there comes a time

00:55.300 --> 01:00.520
in a woman's life when you have to take a step back, look yourself in the mirror, and

01:00.520 --> 01:06.840
admit, this is some high-key, lesbicious behavior. And I'm going to talk you through how I got

01:06.840 --> 01:11.660
to that point. So, story time, I fell in love with my best friend. Story time, telling my

01:11.660 --> 01:16.360
boyfriend I'm a lesbian. Story time, my parents walked in on my Taco Bell mukbang. Exposed,

01:16.600 --> 01:21.340
graphic, the tea is piping hot. For a long time on this channel, the official story has

01:21.340 --> 01:25.280
been that I'm bi. I'm a super fucking bi. But I haven't dated.

01:25.300 --> 01:29.880
I haven't dated women since I transitioned. And for a while there, I got pretty deep into

01:29.880 --> 01:35.720
the straight lifestyle. This really started in 2018. By that summer, I had privately convinced

01:35.720 --> 01:41.960
myself that I was a fully heterosexual woman. And we're going to circle back to how I reached

01:41.960 --> 01:46.460
that conclusion. But I'm starting in the middle of things. I'm like an epic poet.

01:47.380 --> 01:52.400
Hail Muse. Hey, how are you, gorge? So at the beginning of 2018, I became close friends,

01:52.400 --> 01:55.060
I'd even say best friends, with a woman whom

01:55.300 --> 02:03.900
I'll call Joanne. Light of my life. Can we get some melodramatic music, please? Yeah,

02:03.900 --> 02:07.460
here we go. You're going to want to pour yourself a glass of something nice. I want you to fully

02:07.460 --> 02:13.120
enjoy my pain. So my friendship with Joanne got very intense, very fast. It was that kind

02:13.120 --> 02:17.600
of friendship where you develop your own private language of references and in-jokes, and you

02:17.600 --> 02:21.260
drive everyone around you crazy with your unintelligible banter. We'd call each other

02:21.260 --> 02:25.280
pretty much every day, and we'd talk for hours. And I don't think I've ever called her and

02:25.280 --> 02:29.920
not been laughing or smiling in the first 20 seconds, which is very unusual for me, because

02:29.920 --> 02:35.120
I am a weird, and I don't get along that well with that many people. One reason we got so emotionally

02:35.120 --> 02:40.480
close is we're both trans. And there's a kind of intuitive understanding and a sense of humor that

02:40.480 --> 02:46.000
I can share with another trans woman that I can't really have with anyone else. Oh, and by the way,

02:46.000 --> 02:53.600
Joanne also happens to be just angelically beautiful, which I did notice every time I looked at her.

02:53.600 --> 02:55.040
And from the beginning of this relationship,

02:55.280 --> 03:01.300
it wasn't sexual, but it wasn't exactly platonic either. We'd get drunk and make out. We'd sleep in

03:01.300 --> 03:08.300
the same bed and cuddle. Straight girls do that, right? Gal pals. I remember one of the first times

03:08.300 --> 03:12.440
I hung out with Joanne, we got our nails done together. And that night, we were bar hopping,

03:12.660 --> 03:17.520
and she took my pretty hand and her pretty hand, and we walked down the street together holding

03:17.520 --> 03:23.640
hands. This is garbage, and I want to die. I hope you all know that I'm in agony. Later,

03:23.640 --> 03:25.100
we were at a bar table with friends.

03:25.280 --> 03:30.420
And every time one of us needed a drink, we'd run off to the bar, and she'd secretly kiss me.

03:30.420 --> 03:34.700
Ah, it's still one of the most magical gay things that's ever happened to me.

03:34.700 --> 03:39.860
Joanne had a boyfriend at the time, but he didn't care. A lot of men think girls kissing is hot,

03:39.860 --> 03:43.740
but they don't take it seriously. They don't think it could ever mean anything or

03:43.740 --> 03:50.140
lead to a real relationship. Gal pals. Just kill me. Take me out behind the shed,

03:50.140 --> 03:55.060
put me down humanely, and just buy a new YouTuber before the kids get home, and they won't know,

03:55.280 --> 04:00.740
I guess. So this very intimate friendship went on for about a year without me acknowledging to

04:00.740 --> 04:06.440
Joanne or to myself that I was falling in love. So not only was I in denial about being in love

04:06.440 --> 04:12.680
with her, but at the same time, I had basically convinced myself that I only wanted to date men.

04:12.680 --> 04:18.980
So how could I possibly think that? Well, the short answer is shame. Why is no one talking

04:18.980 --> 04:25.260
about the shame? I was so ashamed of my attraction to women. There were days I thought the shame was

04:25.260 --> 04:30.860
going to crush me to death. Oh, I wanted to be straight so bad, and let no one say I didn't make

04:30.860 --> 04:36.420
a strong attempt. There should honestly be a statue of me sucking dick in a town square with

04:36.420 --> 04:42.240
the inscription, here knelt Natalie Wynn, attempted heterosexual. I'm a bronze star lesbian. Well,

04:42.760 --> 04:48.240
if we're really being honest, I don't think I get a star. Oh, I was desperate to be straight.

04:48.240 --> 04:55.040
I tried prayer. I tried electric shocks. All the classics. All the hits. You know, the idea is,

04:55.040 --> 04:58.600
if you shock yourself every time you think about women, you start to associate the two in your

04:58.600 --> 05:05.620
head. So now I'm a lesbian and I enjoy electric shocks. This is supposed to hurt, but I just feel

05:05.620 --> 05:09.860
like I'm on a road trip with Cate Blanchett. So at some point, the shame was just too much for me,

05:10.060 --> 05:15.760
and it literally broke my brain. I no longer wanted to be straight. I simply deluded myself

05:15.760 --> 05:22.200
into thinking I was straight. Maybe a little bi. A little bi. By that time, I started dating men,

05:22.200 --> 05:24.960
and I got into a serious long-term relationship,

05:25.040 --> 05:28.960
with a man. And at first, I explained away my feelings for Joanne, by telling myself,

05:28.960 --> 05:34.080
female friendships are just really intense. That's probably why I feel so strongly. And

05:34.080 --> 05:39.600
everyone thinks women are beautiful, so it's only natural I notice that. And, you know,

05:41.520 --> 05:46.480
spend a lot of time thinking about it. So this nonsense went on until the beginning

05:46.480 --> 05:52.080
of last year, and then two things happened. First, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

05:55.040 --> 05:58.800
Second, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian. Third, Joanne started dating a cis lesbian.

05:58.800 --> 06:02.640
Fuck my drag, right? I think before that, I always knew she was bi, but

06:03.200 --> 06:08.320
some combination of self-interested denial and biphobia allowed me to write off my initial

06:08.320 --> 06:13.200
crush on her as, I just have a thing for my straight best friend. Like, who doesn't?

06:13.200 --> 06:17.040
But that's a very self-serving narrative, because it quarantines your feelings inside

06:17.040 --> 06:22.080
the safety of unattainable fantasy, and it wards off the pain of potential rejection.

06:22.080 --> 06:24.720
Because that way, it's not really me she's rejecting, it's just,

06:25.120 --> 06:27.840
she's just not that into women. But once she started dating women,

06:28.560 --> 06:34.720
I couldn't tell myself that anymore. And the jealousy hit me so hard, I couldn't ignore it.

06:34.720 --> 06:38.880
Second, around that same time, Joanne decided to visit me for a few weeks.

06:38.880 --> 06:41.760
It was a long-distance friendship. And about halfway through that visit,

06:42.400 --> 06:49.600
I cracked. One morning, I woke up next to her, and I looked at her pretty fucking face,

06:49.600 --> 06:54.000
and I had the thought, I want to wake up next to you every day of my life.

06:54.720 --> 07:01.680
And that is a pretty alarming thought for a petite heterosexual bio girl to have about her gal pal.

07:01.680 --> 07:07.680
Oh, never in my life have I fallen so deeply in love with someone. Like, what the fuck is this?

07:07.680 --> 07:13.520
What am I feeling? I was experiencing an intensity of emotion that has no right to exist outside of

07:13.520 --> 07:20.560
19th century Italian opera. So I confessed my feelings to Joanne, and love confession gone wrong,

07:20.560 --> 07:21.520
devastating.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.160
...

07:22.160 --> 07:22.660
...

07:22.660 --> 07:23.160
...

07:23.160 --> 07:23.660
...

07:23.660 --> 07:24.160
...

07:24.160 --> 07:24.660
...

07:24.660 --> 07:25.160
...

07:25.160 --> 07:25.660
...

07:25.660 --> 07:29.020
Nurse! My pain is at a 10, I need more pills!

07:29.020 --> 07:32.700
Needless to say, my heart was shattered, I cried a sea of tears, blah blah blah,

07:32.700 --> 07:34.260
I'm sure we all know how that goes.

07:34.260 --> 07:38.340
And here's the thing, if we'd taken a three-month friendship break right then and there,

07:38.940 --> 07:44.020
I might have recovered. But we couldn't keep away from each other. She wasn't in love with me, but

07:44.020 --> 07:49.380
she must have been in something with me, because the truth is, we were never just gal pals.

07:49.380 --> 07:53.220
And I was beyond reason. Like, I probably would have started one of those

07:53.220 --> 07:58.480
... lesbian couple joint Instagram accounts, that's how tragic this got. Those are great, by the way.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.000
Pay no attention to bitter queens.

08:00.000 --> 08:05.480
So for the rest of 2019, Joanne and I kept talking, kept visiting each other, and I just repeated this

08:05.480 --> 08:10.880
heartbreak again and again and again. Now if she had reciprocated my feelings, I probably would have

08:10.880 --> 08:15.720
come out as gay last year, because the heat of a romantic relationship has a way of evaporating

08:15.720 --> 08:21.200
shame. But rejection and heartbreak are shameful in themselves, and only made the situation worse.

08:21.200 --> 08:21.220
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of bed with Joanne, and I was like, what the fuck is going on?

08:21.220 --> 08:21.320
I was like, what the fuck is going on? I was like, what the fuck is going on? I was like, what the fuck is going on?

08:21.320 --> 08:27.560
So I spent most of 2019 going in and out of denial, until finally, last October, I got super

08:27.560 --> 08:32.280
fucking cancelled on Twitter as discussed in my last video. Link in the description! Subscribe!

08:32.280 --> 08:36.600
And at the same time, Joanne realized that she was going to have to be the one to enforce a

08:36.600 --> 08:41.000
friendship break, otherwise I was never going to get over her. So there was this combination of

08:41.000 --> 08:46.200
things, being politically cancelled by Twitter, being romantically cancelled by Joanne, and also

08:46.200 --> 08:50.600
losing her as my closest friend, which sent me into this catatonic,

08:50.600 --> 08:51.300
rock-bottom,

08:51.320 --> 08:56.360
kind of depression. And of course depression is a terrible thing, but I think it can also serve a

08:56.360 --> 09:02.280
purpose. Because depression brings your life to a standstill, and in the quiet of that standstill,

09:02.280 --> 09:06.920
you sometimes feel outside yourself. And with that, comes a new perspective.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.840
So last December, when I was lying around drinking White Claw all day and

09:10.840 --> 09:16.280
binge-watching Orange is the Bluest L Word, I actually didn't feel so much shame anymore.

09:16.280 --> 09:20.520
And that gave me a new kind of clarity. I looked back on the last couple years,

09:20.520 --> 09:26.440
and saw that I'd been avoiding the obvious. So that's what it took for me to finally face the

09:26.440 --> 09:32.480
fact that I am a, uh… I am a gay, not clickbait.

09:32.480 --> 09:34.420
I'm sorry.

09:34.420 --> 09:35.420
No, no.

09:35.420 --> 09:36.420
I'm sorry.

09:36.420 --> 09:37.420
You're not.

09:37.420 --> 09:38.420
You're not.

09:38.420 --> 09:39.420
You're not.

09:39.420 --> 09:40.420
You're not.

09:40.420 --> 09:41.420
You're not.

09:41.420 --> 09:42.420
You're not.

09:42.420 --> 09:43.420
You're not.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.420
You're not.

09:44.420 --> 09:45.420
You're not.

09:45.420 --> 09:46.420
You're not.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.420
You're not.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.420
You're not.

09:48.420 --> 09:49.420
You're not.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.420
You're not.

09:50.520 --> 09:57.520
Adam's a great guy and all, but I want Lilith.

10:03.520 --> 10:04.520
Shame.

10:04.520 --> 10:07.520
This floral fantasy is a little less Mother of Mankind

10:07.520 --> 10:10.520
and a little more Coachella 2015.

10:10.520 --> 10:11.520
Well that's my Eden.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.520
Candy flipping. I love it.

10:13.520 --> 10:17.520
Okay, let's circle back and talk about how a wholesome homo like me

10:17.520 --> 10:19.520
wound up in the clutches of the straight agenda.

10:19.520 --> 10:22.520
It starts with denial, and there's two sides to gay denial.

10:22.520 --> 10:26.520
First, there was a period where I repressed or explained away my attraction to women.

10:26.520 --> 10:28.520
Female friendships are just really intense.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.520
Straight girls have girl crushes too.

10:30.520 --> 10:34.520
And second, I experienced and acted on what I genuinely thought

10:34.520 --> 10:36.520
was sexual and romantic attraction to men.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.520
And to be honest, I'm still kind of struggling to make sense of all this.

10:39.520 --> 10:41.520
Maybe I'm not quite ready to make this video,

10:41.520 --> 10:45.520
but I'm afraid that if I don't, the shame will overpower me again

10:45.520 --> 10:47.520
and I'll slide back into denial.

10:47.520 --> 10:49.520
So, while I'm still here,

10:49.520 --> 10:51.520
still thinking semi-clearly,

10:51.520 --> 10:53.520
let me talk you through the struggle.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.520
Because, like most queer people,

10:55.520 --> 10:58.520
I find nothing more fascinating than an in-depth analysis of my own personality.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.520
She's a Libra.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.520
So in 2017, I started taking feminizing hormones.

11:02.520 --> 11:05.520
And most people are aware of the more obvious effects of that,

11:05.520 --> 11:07.520
like, it makes you grow breasts.

11:07.520 --> 11:09.520
At least, in theory.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.520
I just added progesterone, we'll see if that does anything.

11:12.520 --> 11:16.520
But the lesser known thing is it has some pretty major effects on your mood and your sexuality.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.520
The first few months I was on hormones,

11:19.520 --> 11:21.520
I didn't know if I was now asexual

11:21.520 --> 11:24.520
because the libido I had known before was just gone.

11:24.520 --> 11:26.520
But I'm very much not asexual.

11:26.520 --> 11:32.520
It just took me a while to adjust to an endocrinologically female sex drive.

11:32.520 --> 11:34.520
One of the differences for me is

11:34.520 --> 11:37.520
it's not as obvious now whomst I'm attracted to.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.520
Just looking at an attractive person,

11:39.520 --> 11:41.520
well, let's put it this way,

11:41.520 --> 11:43.520
it sparks my interest,

11:43.520 --> 11:45.520
but it doesn't light my fire.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.520
It's not the instant inferno that is testosterone-fueled lust.

11:48.520 --> 11:51.520
It's a slow burn that has to be built up.

11:51.520 --> 11:53.520
Some people call this demisexual,

11:53.520 --> 11:56.520
which is a term I'm ambivalent about,

11:56.520 --> 11:59.520
but I think the concept it describes applies to me.

11:59.520 --> 12:03.520
Like, I form little crushes on people based on watching their YouTube videos or whatever,

12:03.520 --> 12:06.520
but I don't feel intense sexual attraction to anyone

12:06.520 --> 12:08.520
until I've gotten close to them as a friend.

12:08.520 --> 12:12.520
So I have a hard time getting too excited about casual dating, you know?

12:12.520 --> 12:14.520
Can't I just find a new best friend,

12:14.520 --> 12:17.520
fall insanely in love with her, and then get gay married?

12:17.520 --> 12:19.520
I know that's not how it works.

12:19.520 --> 12:20.520
I have to play the field.

12:20.520 --> 12:23.520
I also think it's a reason I don't really like porn that much.

12:23.520 --> 12:27.520
Because sex without context is just mechanics to me.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.520
It's boring.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.520
The buildup of desire, that's the interesting part,

12:31.520 --> 12:34.520
and the struggle between desire and shame.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.520
I shouldn't, but I want to.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.520
That's how you build a plotline, kids.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.520
I'm also guessing this kind of slow burn sexuality

12:41.520 --> 12:43.520
is more common in women than men.

12:43.520 --> 12:46.520
And I wonder if that's a reason why gay men

12:46.520 --> 12:49.520
tend to know they're gay at an earlier age than gay women.

12:49.520 --> 12:51.520
When you have teenage boy testosterone levels,

12:51.520 --> 12:55.520
it's harder to be agnostic or mistaken about who you're attracted to.

12:55.520 --> 12:58.520
Whereas, there's a lot of gay women who don't realize they're gay

12:58.520 --> 13:00.520
until they're in their 30s or even later.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.520
And thank God for them!

13:02.520 --> 13:04.520
They make me feel less bad about my wasted youth.

13:04.520 --> 13:07.520
So it's hard for me to use visual sexual interest

13:07.520 --> 13:09.520
as a guide to my sexuality.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.520
Because I do feel aesthetic attraction towards beautiful people of any gender,

13:13.520 --> 13:15.520
and that can be pretty intense in its own right.

13:15.520 --> 13:17.520
I guess the difference for me is

13:17.520 --> 13:19.520
looking at a beautiful woman

13:19.520 --> 13:22.520
is more emotionally captivating to me

13:22.520 --> 13:24.520
than looking at a beautiful man.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.520
Which can be moving in its own way,

13:26.520 --> 13:29.520
but it's more like the way I'm moved by,

13:29.520 --> 13:30.520
I don't know,

13:30.520 --> 13:31.520
the Parthenon.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.520
You know, it's sturdy,

13:33.520 --> 13:34.520
symmetrical,

13:34.520 --> 13:35.520
has impressive columns.

13:35.520 --> 13:37.520
That's not to say it's totally asexual.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.520
I mean, I'd fuck the Parthenon.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.520
I'd fuck it so hard.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.520
I admit I do have some kind of erotic fascination with masculinity,

13:44.520 --> 13:47.520
and maybe that stems from my pre-transition sense

13:47.520 --> 13:49.520
of having failed at masculinity,

13:49.520 --> 13:51.520
so I'm mesmerized by the real thing.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.520
There's something about the contrast

13:53.520 --> 13:55.520
between me and a masculine man

13:55.520 --> 13:58.520
that's sexually intriguing to me.

13:58.520 --> 14:01.520
Like I've sometimes pleasantly gasped

14:01.520 --> 14:05.520
at the feeling of hairy, muscly arms

14:05.520 --> 14:09.520
enfolding my smooth, fragile body.

14:09.520 --> 14:11.520
Or maybe it's more Freudian,

14:11.520 --> 14:13.520
the masculine man as Daddy,

14:13.520 --> 14:14.520
the archetypal father,

14:14.520 --> 14:16.520
the symbolic power of the phallus.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.520
Penetration is the ultimate expression of desire and possession.

14:19.520 --> 14:22.520
There's a lot of sexual connotations to manhood,

14:22.520 --> 14:24.520
and I think that's why I can look at a sexy man

14:24.520 --> 14:27.520
and create plausible fantasies in my head

14:27.520 --> 14:30.520
where I'd absolutely enjoy letting him do things to me.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.520
And I can find things I like about male bodies,

14:33.520 --> 14:35.520
like they're very warm.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.520
I love it when you get under the covers with a man

14:38.520 --> 14:39.520
and he warms you up.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.520
But that's when the lesbian voice comes into my head

14:41.520 --> 14:42.520
and she says,

14:42.520 --> 14:44.520
but are you attracted to men?

14:44.520 --> 14:47.520
Or do you just like being warm?

14:47.520 --> 14:49.520
My attraction to women is very different.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.520
I look at a beautiful woman and it's just like,

14:51.520 --> 14:55.520
oh no, you're gorgeous, you're beautiful.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.520
This is going to destroy me.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.520
You know, it can actually be painful

14:59.520 --> 15:01.520
how beautiful a woman is.

15:01.520 --> 15:03.520
I've never once been in pain over male beauty,

15:03.520 --> 15:04.520
but around Joanne,

15:04.520 --> 15:06.520
once I was open about my feelings and things got bad,

15:06.520 --> 15:09.520
there'd be moments I'd have to just look away from her

15:09.520 --> 15:11.520
and be like, don't even enter my line of sight right now.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.520
You're too beautiful, I can't stand it.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.520
There's a kind of sick masochism

15:15.520 --> 15:17.520
in wanting someone who doesn't want you back.

15:17.520 --> 15:19.520
It's insatiable, like an addiction.

15:19.520 --> 15:20.520
And on the flip side,

15:20.520 --> 15:24.520
there's an intense erotic thrill in being desired.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.520
I think that's what got me interested in men

15:26.520 --> 15:27.520
in the first place.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.520
It's that they're interested in me.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.520
And that's pretty interesting.

15:32.520 --> 15:35.520
I've felt desired by men

15:35.520 --> 15:37.520
in a way I've never truly felt desired by women.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.520
You know, a man will glower at you

15:39.520 --> 15:41.520
with that agitation,

15:41.520 --> 15:43.520
agitated, carnivorous desperation.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.520
Fuck me up, King.

15:45.520 --> 15:46.520
God, that's hot.

15:46.520 --> 15:47.520
Gets me every time.

15:47.520 --> 15:50.520
But notice how excitement at the attention,

15:50.520 --> 15:53.520
the flattery of being desired,

15:53.520 --> 15:57.520
is not the same thing as attraction to men.

15:57.520 --> 16:00.520
You know, there's a difference between I want you

16:00.520 --> 16:02.520
and I like that you want me.

16:02.520 --> 16:05.520
But for a long time, I confused one for the other.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.520
And one reason I was able to do that

16:07.520 --> 16:10.520
is that the normative sexual role for women

16:10.520 --> 16:13.520
is to be pursued, possessed, desired,

16:13.520 --> 16:16.520
seduced, dominated by men.

16:16.520 --> 16:18.520
It's all very passive.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.520
And in most of the sexual encounters I've had with men,

16:21.520 --> 16:23.520
I've taken a very submissive role.

16:23.520 --> 16:26.520
Sometimes I just submit to the glower

16:26.520 --> 16:28.520
and let them do things to me.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.520
And I do think that the thrill of being desired

16:31.520 --> 16:33.520
is a valid thing to want.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.520
I like that feeling myself,

16:35.520 --> 16:37.520
and I do genuinely enjoy taking on

16:37.520 --> 16:39.520
a more submissive role sometimes.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.520
But you have to go about it thoughtfully.

16:41.520 --> 16:43.520
Because if you don't,

16:43.520 --> 16:47.520
sexual submission can be a way to avoid

16:47.520 --> 16:50.520
confronting what your desires actually are.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.520
It's freedom from freedom.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.520
And if you're ashamed of your sexual orientation,

16:54.520 --> 16:56.520
and ashamed of your transsexual body,

16:56.520 --> 16:59.520
and ashamed of having any sexual feelings at all

16:59.520 --> 17:02.520
because of stigma about trans women being fetishists,

17:02.520 --> 17:05.520
then relinquishing responsibility for your own desires

17:05.520 --> 17:07.520
by letting someone else take control

17:07.520 --> 17:08.520
can be the only way

17:08.520 --> 17:10.520
you can enjoy sex at all.

17:10.520 --> 17:11.520
And for a while,

17:11.520 --> 17:13.520
it was almost the only way I could enjoy it.

17:13.520 --> 17:16.520
And I was able to convince myself that was normal

17:16.520 --> 17:20.520
because the sexual situation of a lot of cis straight women

17:20.520 --> 17:22.520
isn't really that much more liberated.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.520
Like I read Fifty Shades of Grey years ago

17:25.520 --> 17:27.520
and totally identified with the fantasy.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.520
And later,

17:28.520 --> 17:30.520
I thought that was evidence

17:30.520 --> 17:32.520
I had normative female desires.

17:32.520 --> 17:34.520
Never mind that I was identifying

17:34.520 --> 17:36.520
with the midlife crisis fantasies

17:36.520 --> 17:38.520
of a repressed English housewife,

17:38.520 --> 17:41.520
longing to be brutalized by a capitalist tyrant.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.520
I mean, not to shame women

17:42.520 --> 17:46.520
who genuinely do enjoy a healthier version of that fantasy,

17:46.520 --> 17:47.520
I think a lot of women

17:47.520 --> 17:50.520
pointlessly suffer under a kind of feminist guilt about that.

17:50.520 --> 17:52.520
But what makes me different is that for me,

17:52.520 --> 17:54.520
submission to a man

17:54.520 --> 17:57.520
was simply the only way I could enjoy sex without shame.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.520
And that's a lot of what I did for a couple years,

17:59.520 --> 18:03.520
even though my real sexual attraction is to women.

18:03.520 --> 18:06.520
Whereas, even in the most patriarchal situation,

18:06.520 --> 18:08.520
straight women are,

18:08.520 --> 18:10.520
ultimately attracted to men,

18:10.520 --> 18:12.520
and sexually aroused by male bodies.

18:12.520 --> 18:13.520
Or are they?

18:13.520 --> 18:14.520
Gay men certainly are,

18:14.520 --> 18:17.520
and gay women are just rhapsodic about women.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.520
But a lot of straight women are just kind of,

18:19.520 --> 18:20.520
meh,

18:20.520 --> 18:22.520
about male bodies and men in general.

18:22.520 --> 18:23.520
Which,

18:23.520 --> 18:25.520
what is that about?

18:25.520 --> 18:26.520
I just,

18:26.520 --> 18:27.520
I just,

18:27.520 --> 18:29.520
do not understand straight women.

18:29.520 --> 18:31.520
I don't think I ever will,

18:31.520 --> 18:32.520
and that's okay.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.520
I'm just gonna accept my bewilderment

18:34.520 --> 18:36.520
and move on with my lesbian life.

18:36.520 --> 18:37.520
Now,

18:37.520 --> 18:39.520
what I've been giving you so far

18:39.520 --> 18:41.520
is a retrospective analysis,

18:41.520 --> 18:45.520
an autopsy of my romantic failings of the last two years.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.520
But you have to understand

18:46.520 --> 18:48.520
that when I was living through this,

18:48.520 --> 18:49.520
I experienced it very differently,

18:49.520 --> 18:51.520
because I didn't have these insights.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.520
So I wasn't thinking,

18:52.520 --> 18:54.520
oh, I'm not really attracted to men,

18:54.520 --> 18:56.520
but I enjoy the thrill of being desired by them,

18:56.520 --> 18:58.520
so I'm gonna pursue that

18:58.520 --> 19:00.520
to distract myself from how ashamed I am

19:00.520 --> 19:01.520
of my attraction to women.

19:01.520 --> 19:02.520
No.

19:02.520 --> 19:03.520
Subconsciously,

19:03.520 --> 19:05.520
I put my attraction to women on mute.

19:05.520 --> 19:06.520
At least,

19:06.520 --> 19:07.520
Joanne ruined my life.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.520
And I genuinely thought I was attracted to men,

19:10.520 --> 19:13.520
which was a lot more than just a frivolous sexual fantasy.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.520
I had a serious long-term boyfriend

19:15.520 --> 19:16.520
for a year and a half,

19:16.520 --> 19:19.520
who I had very genuine feelings for.

19:19.520 --> 19:20.520
Plot twist,

19:20.520 --> 19:21.520
story time.

19:21.520 --> 19:22.520
So,

19:22.520 --> 19:23.520
my ex-boyfriend,

19:23.520 --> 19:24.520
let's call him

19:26.520 --> 19:27.520
Chad.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.520
Oh, and he was a Chad.

19:28.520 --> 19:29.520
Like,

19:29.520 --> 19:31.520
full Giga-Chad fantasy.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.520
You know, he was very masculine,

19:33.520 --> 19:34.520
taller than me,

19:34.520 --> 19:36.520
objectively attractive,

19:36.520 --> 19:37.520
very charming.

19:37.520 --> 19:39.520
Straight women used to tell me all the time

19:39.520 --> 19:41.520
they were jealous of me for being with him,

19:41.520 --> 19:43.520
and obviously I loved that.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.520
To me,

19:44.520 --> 19:45.520
Chad represented

19:45.520 --> 19:47.520
almost an ideal of manhood,

19:47.520 --> 19:49.520
a sort of archetypal romantic lead

19:49.520 --> 19:51.520
who swept me off my feet

19:51.520 --> 19:53.520
and fulfilled my sick fantasies

19:53.520 --> 19:55.520
of being a heterosexual woman.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.520
Now, you probably think I'm gonna say

19:57.520 --> 19:59.520
that he was just an abstract fantasy to me,

19:59.520 --> 20:01.520
but that once it came to actually dating,

20:01.520 --> 20:03.520
I realized I didn't like it.

20:03.520 --> 20:04.520
But honestly,

20:04.520 --> 20:05.520
it's more complicated than that.

20:05.520 --> 20:07.520
Like, at the beginning,

20:07.520 --> 20:09.520
I was the one who pursued him,

20:09.520 --> 20:11.520
and I still think of him as the one

20:11.520 --> 20:13.520
genuine boy crush of my life.

20:13.520 --> 20:14.520
When we started dating,

20:14.520 --> 20:16.520
it was really exciting.

20:16.520 --> 20:17.520
I'd never had a boyfriend before,

20:17.520 --> 20:19.520
and he'd never been with a trans woman before,

20:19.520 --> 20:21.520
and we had this, like,

20:21.520 --> 20:23.520
adorably heterosexual energy together,

20:23.520 --> 20:25.520
like, holding hands in the park.

20:25.520 --> 20:26.520
It was cute!

20:26.520 --> 20:28.520
This would be a better lesbian story

20:28.520 --> 20:29.520
if Chad was a Cad.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.520
But he wasn't.

20:30.520 --> 20:31.520
He was great.

20:31.520 --> 20:33.520
He took very good care of me.

20:33.520 --> 20:34.520
He was never ashamed to be seen,

20:34.520 --> 20:36.520
or of his friends and family

20:36.520 --> 20:38.520
knowing he was dating me,

20:38.520 --> 20:40.520
which, if you're a trans woman,

20:40.520 --> 20:42.520
that's a huge deal.

20:42.520 --> 20:44.520
He was a lot less ashamed of me

20:44.520 --> 20:45.520
than I am of myself.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.520
And when I was with him,

20:47.520 --> 20:49.520
I wasn't ashamed.

20:49.520 --> 20:51.520
And that meant a lot.

20:51.520 --> 20:54.520
So I really wanted this to work.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.520
Like, if I was gonna be with a man,

20:56.520 --> 20:58.520
he was the one.

20:58.520 --> 20:59.520
And for a year or so,

20:59.520 --> 21:01.520
I thought it was working.

21:01.520 --> 21:03.520
I enjoyed the time we spent together.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.520
I missed him when he was gone.

21:05.520 --> 21:07.520
I told him I loved him,

21:07.520 --> 21:08.520
and I meant it.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.520
But what happened is,

21:09.520 --> 21:10.520
by the end of the first year,

21:10.520 --> 21:13.520
the initial excitement had died down.

21:13.520 --> 21:15.520
And while Chad was ready

21:15.520 --> 21:17.520
to keep escalating the relationship,

21:17.520 --> 21:19.520
I was realizing that

21:19.520 --> 21:21.520
something was very seriously,

21:21.520 --> 21:23.520
emotionally wrong on my end.

21:23.520 --> 21:25.520
There was something missing.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.520
And when I realized

21:26.520 --> 21:28.520
I was in love with Joanne,

21:28.520 --> 21:29.520
I was like,

21:29.520 --> 21:31.520
there's that missing feeling.

21:31.520 --> 21:32.520
And I started to understand

21:32.520 --> 21:34.520
what my problem was.

21:34.520 --> 21:36.520
Then, last fall,

21:36.520 --> 21:38.520
I posted to Instagram

21:38.520 --> 21:39.520
an aloof picture of me

21:39.520 --> 21:40.520
with the caption,

21:40.520 --> 21:42.520
do I actually like men?

21:42.520 --> 21:44.520
Or do I just like attention?

21:44.520 --> 21:46.520
And I didn't mean anything serious by that.

21:46.520 --> 21:47.520
I was just joking around.

21:47.520 --> 21:49.520
You know, you can post something like that,

21:49.520 --> 21:51.520
and a bunch of straight women will respond like,

21:51.520 --> 21:53.520
yeah, fuck men.

21:53.520 --> 21:55.520
What is their damage?

21:55.520 --> 21:56.520
Well, they're stuck dating men.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.520
That's their damage.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.520
But a few people left comments saying,

21:59.520 --> 22:01.520
oh, are you making a video about comphet?

22:01.520 --> 22:03.520
You should make a video about comphet.

22:03.520 --> 22:04.520
And I was like,

22:04.520 --> 22:06.520
what the fuck is comphet?

22:06.520 --> 22:07.520
So I Googled it,

22:07.520 --> 22:09.520
and I learned that comphet is short

22:09.520 --> 22:12.520
for compulsory heterosexuality.

22:12.520 --> 22:13.520
Basically, it's the idea

22:13.520 --> 22:16.520
that heterosexuality is socially required of women.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.520
And it's so bound up with the conventional idea

22:19.520 --> 22:21.520
of what it even means to be a woman

22:21.520 --> 22:24.520
that gay women often mistakenly believe

22:24.520 --> 22:27.520
for years that they're attracted to men.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.520
And this Google search led me to a Reddit post

22:30.520 --> 22:32.520
called the Am I a Lesbian Master Doc?

22:32.520 --> 22:34.520
And I'm reading through this post like,

22:34.520 --> 22:38.520
oh no, this sounds terribly familiar.

22:38.520 --> 22:39.520
Quote,

22:39.520 --> 22:42.520
compulsory heterosexuality is the voice in my head

22:42.520 --> 22:44.520
that says I must really be het

22:44.520 --> 22:46.520
even when I'm in love with a woman.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.520
Quote,

22:47.520 --> 22:49.520
you have every reason to be happy

22:49.520 --> 22:50.520
in your relationship with a man,

22:50.520 --> 22:52.520
but you just aren't.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.520
Everything is going really well,

22:53.520 --> 22:54.520
but something is missing

22:54.520 --> 22:56.520
and you can't figure out what.

22:56.520 --> 22:57.520
So next thing you know,

22:57.520 --> 22:59.520
I'm doing tequila shots at 3 a.m.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.520
and taking Am I a Lesbian internet quizzes

23:01.520 --> 23:03.520
that were clearly designed for 13 year olds.

23:03.520 --> 23:06.520
And I'm fully a 31 year old transsexual

23:06.520 --> 23:07.520
taking this quiz like,

23:07.520 --> 23:09.520
it's true, Samantha was right,

23:09.520 --> 23:11.520
I am a total les.

23:11.520 --> 23:13.520
All the cis gay people watching this video

23:13.520 --> 23:15.520
probably want to kill me right now

23:15.520 --> 23:17.520
because y'all figured this shit out in high school

23:17.520 --> 23:19.520
and I'm sitting here in my 30s like,

23:19.520 --> 23:22.520
it's just, I just, I just can't, I just.

23:22.520 --> 23:24.520
Well, can I be a melodramatic baby gay

23:24.520 --> 23:26.520
for 30 minutes of my lifetime, please?

23:26.520 --> 23:28.520
Is it all right with you, the gays?

23:28.520 --> 23:29.520
So to be honest,

23:29.520 --> 23:33.520
I still experience comphet thoughts and fantasies.

23:33.520 --> 23:34.520
Like for a long time,

23:34.520 --> 23:36.520
I've had what seemed to be romantic fantasies

23:36.520 --> 23:38.520
about marrying a man.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.520
But after a lot of introspection,

23:39.520 --> 23:43.520
I've realized that this is not really a fantasy

23:43.520 --> 23:46.520
of private happiness and fulfillment.

23:46.520 --> 23:50.520
It's a fantasy of a social prestige and acceptance.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.520
Like, can you imagine if I got married

23:52.520 --> 23:55.520
to a tall, handsome man

23:55.520 --> 23:57.520
at an opulent wedding

23:57.520 --> 24:00.520
with lots of photographers posting to Instagram?

24:00.520 --> 24:03.520
Ah, I'd be queen of the trannies.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.520
I'd be super heckin' valid, uwu.

24:05.520 --> 24:07.520
But I don't actually want to be married.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.520
I want to get married.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.520
I want to have a wedding.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.520
Basically, I want to wear a wedding dress.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.520
I want attention, okay?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.520
Please, pay, pay attention to me.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.520
So I can totally deconstruct the fantasy,

24:19.520 --> 24:22.520
but it's still really hard for me to let it go.

24:22.520 --> 24:25.520
I cling to the reassuring conformity of heterosexuality

24:25.520 --> 24:27.520
because there's a level

24:27.520 --> 24:30.520
of gender instability and deviancy

24:30.520 --> 24:32.520
that's inherent to homosexuality.

24:32.520 --> 24:33.520
And until recently,

24:33.520 --> 24:37.520
I wasn't secure enough in my gender to handle that.

24:37.520 --> 24:40.520
Lesbianism is a very advanced form of womanhood,

24:40.520 --> 24:42.520
and I think I needed to go through

24:42.520 --> 24:44.520
the more one-on-one straight girl experience

24:44.520 --> 24:46.520
before attempting anything as difficult as that.

24:46.520 --> 24:48.520
I still have a hard time imagining

24:48.520 --> 24:50.520
a happy future for myself

24:50.520 --> 24:52.520
as a woman partnered to a woman.

24:52.520 --> 24:54.520
And I think that's partly because

24:54.520 --> 24:56.520
good lesbian representation in media

24:56.520 --> 24:58.520
is so sparse.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.520
The best we have is a Showtime melodrama

25:00.520 --> 25:02.520
from 15 years ago,

25:02.520 --> 25:03.520
which I do like,

25:03.520 --> 25:05.520
and I like the new one too.

25:05.520 --> 25:06.520
But after that,

25:06.520 --> 25:07.520
the runner-up is,

25:07.520 --> 25:08.520
I mean,

25:08.520 --> 25:11.520
maybe not the lesbian representation we need.

25:11.520 --> 25:13.520
It's a YouTube show about two drag queens

25:13.520 --> 25:14.520
whomst we ship.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.520
Well, I don't ship them,

25:15.520 --> 25:17.520
because I have a fully lesbian

25:17.520 --> 25:18.520
parasocial internet crush

25:18.520 --> 25:19.520
on Katya Zamolochkova.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.520
Don't laugh at me.

25:20.520 --> 25:21.520
She's smart.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.520
She's funny.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.520
She's beautiful.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.520
That's everything I'm looking for in a woman.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.520
Sure, some haters and losers

25:26.520 --> 25:28.520
will probably try to convince me

25:28.520 --> 25:30.520
that Katya is in fact a homosexual man

25:30.520 --> 25:31.520
posing as a woman,

25:31.520 --> 25:32.520
but you know what?

25:32.520 --> 25:34.520
This is a super fucking vulnerable moment in my life,

25:34.520 --> 25:36.520
and I don't need this right now.

25:38.520 --> 25:40.520
I need to be touched by a real woman.

25:40.520 --> 25:42.520
I'm losing my goddamn mind.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.520
It's so deeply embedded in our culture

25:45.520 --> 25:46.520
that marrying a man

25:46.520 --> 25:48.520
is the end goal of womanhood.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.520
And it's not just Disney movies,

25:50.520 --> 25:52.520
like, it's the Bible,

25:52.520 --> 25:54.520
it's Greek mythology,

25:54.520 --> 25:55.520
American fairy tales,

25:55.520 --> 25:56.520
Victorian novels.

25:56.520 --> 25:57.520
The whole weight of cultural history

25:57.520 --> 25:58.520
is telling you

25:58.520 --> 26:00.520
that what it means to succeed as a woman

26:00.520 --> 26:02.520
is to marry a man.

26:02.520 --> 26:04.520
And if you're already super dysphoric

26:04.520 --> 26:06.520
and insecure about your gender,

26:06.520 --> 26:08.520
then to reject that possibility?

26:08.520 --> 26:10.520
Ah, it hurts.

26:10.520 --> 26:11.520
It hurts so bad.

26:11.520 --> 26:12.520
But whenever I think about

26:12.520 --> 26:13.520
having a long-term partner,

26:13.520 --> 26:15.520
you know, not the wedding day,

26:15.520 --> 26:19.520
but the 1000th morning waking up together,

26:19.520 --> 26:21.520
I can only imagine her being a woman.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.520
My brain wants a good man

26:23.520 --> 26:25.520
to take care of me.

26:25.520 --> 26:28.520
But my heart wants a high-maintenance diva

26:28.520 --> 26:29.520
to ruin my life.

26:29.520 --> 26:32.520
And once I knew that for sure,

26:32.520 --> 26:35.520
I thought it would be wrong to stay with Chad.

26:35.520 --> 26:37.520
And this man was like my hinge.

26:37.520 --> 26:39.520
He was holding me together.

26:39.520 --> 26:43.520
But last December,

26:43.520 --> 26:45.520
I broke up with him

26:45.520 --> 26:47.520
because I'm a lesbian,

26:47.520 --> 26:51.520
which at least is a good reason.

26:53.520 --> 26:56.520
I'm having a hard time, you guys.

26:56.520 --> 26:58.520
Leave your pity in the comments.

26:58.520 --> 27:00.520
And I'm starting to regret eating this fruit, too.

27:00.520 --> 27:01.520
I feel like shit.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.520
I think it's the loss of my immortal soul

27:03.520 --> 27:04.520
weighing on me.

27:04.520 --> 27:05.520
I could really use a couple Advil

27:05.520 --> 27:06.520
and a vodka tonic.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.520
I think I might throw some clothes on, too.

27:08.520 --> 27:10.520
Where's that snake?

27:20.520 --> 27:22.520
I already miss my heterosexual nails.

27:22.520 --> 27:24.520
I know these are too long to be gay,

27:24.520 --> 27:25.520
but baby steps, okay?

27:25.520 --> 27:26.520
This is hard for me.

27:26.520 --> 27:27.520
Getting my acrylics removed?

27:27.520 --> 27:28.520
Traumatizing.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.520
I feel like I'm detransitioning.

27:29.520 --> 27:30.520
One of these days,

27:30.520 --> 27:31.520
I will do the lesbian manicure

27:31.520 --> 27:33.520
with acrylics on eight fingers.

27:33.520 --> 27:34.520
I just have to find the courage

27:34.520 --> 27:36.520
to walk into a salon and say,

27:36.520 --> 27:38.520
Hi, I'm a homosexual, please.

27:38.520 --> 27:40.520
I want two short nails

27:40.520 --> 27:42.520
so I can fuck pussy.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.520
Shame.

27:44.520 --> 27:45.520
Let's talk about the shame.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.520
Before I was transgendered,

27:47.520 --> 27:49.520
I really only dated women,

27:49.520 --> 27:51.520
though two of those women

27:51.520 --> 27:53.520
later turned out to be trans,

27:53.520 --> 27:54.520
so I guess we had some way

27:54.520 --> 27:55.520
of finding each other.

27:55.520 --> 27:56.520
An attraction to women

27:56.520 --> 27:58.520
was never really a problem for me

27:58.520 --> 28:00.520
before the transgendering

28:00.520 --> 28:01.520
because I was raised

28:01.520 --> 28:02.520
in an alternative lifestyle

28:02.520 --> 28:04.520
where men are supposed

28:04.520 --> 28:05.520
to be attracted to women.

28:05.520 --> 28:06.520
Crazy, I know.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.520
Not that I'm a newcomer to shame,

28:07.520 --> 28:10.520
because, oh, sweaty?

28:10.520 --> 28:11.520
I was doing plenty of things

28:11.520 --> 28:13.520
that men are not supposed to do.

28:13.520 --> 28:14.520
Before I transitioned,

28:14.520 --> 28:16.520
my shame was centered around

28:16.520 --> 28:17.520
my being, at the time,

28:17.520 --> 28:19.520
a gender nonconforming man,

28:19.520 --> 28:21.520
which, in my early YouTube videos,

28:21.520 --> 28:23.520
I dealt with by caricaturing myself

28:23.520 --> 28:25.520
and basically leaning in

28:25.520 --> 28:27.520
to the public humiliation.

28:27.520 --> 28:29.520
One of my classic techniques.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.520
But now, my shame is centered around

28:31.520 --> 28:33.520
my failure to be a socially acceptable woman.

28:33.520 --> 28:35.520
And the most glaring aspects

28:35.520 --> 28:37.520
of that failure are

28:37.520 --> 28:38.520
my male past,

28:38.520 --> 28:40.520
my sexual orientation,

28:40.520 --> 28:42.520
and the severed human heads

28:42.520 --> 28:43.520
in my refrigerator.

28:43.520 --> 28:45.520
Yeah, killing all those people

28:45.520 --> 28:47.520
was not my most feminine moment,

28:47.520 --> 28:49.520
but I was having a bad skin day.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.520
What was I supposed to do?

28:50.520 --> 28:51.520
So there's two problems

28:51.520 --> 28:53.520
that kind of multiply together.

28:53.520 --> 28:55.520
One, I'm ashamed of being trans.

28:55.520 --> 28:58.520
Two, I'm ashamed of being a lesbian.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.520
And whatever one times two is,

29:01.520 --> 29:03.520
I'm really ashamed

29:03.520 --> 29:05.520
of being a trans lesbian.

29:05.520 --> 29:06.520
Ugh.

29:06.520 --> 29:09.520
And it's difficult and risky

29:09.520 --> 29:11.520
for me to admit these feelings,

29:11.520 --> 29:13.520
because visible queer people

29:13.520 --> 29:15.520
are supposed to perform pride.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.520
Why is no one talking about the shame?

29:17.520 --> 29:19.520
Because we are ashamed of the shame.

29:19.520 --> 29:21.520
But we shouldn't be.

29:21.520 --> 29:24.520
The shame is a natural result of shaming.

29:24.520 --> 29:26.520
I grew up in a media era

29:26.520 --> 29:28.520
when trans women were usually represented

29:28.520 --> 29:30.520
as vomit-inducing monstrosities

29:30.520 --> 29:31.520
who deserve the violence

29:31.520 --> 29:33.520
they bring upon themselves by existing.

29:33.520 --> 29:34.520
And I started my transition

29:34.520 --> 29:36.520
in the first year of the Trump administration

29:36.520 --> 29:38.520
when there's been constant vilification

29:38.520 --> 29:40.520
of trans people in the press.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.520
Invading women's bathrooms,

29:41.520 --> 29:43.520
forcing our insanity on children,

29:43.520 --> 29:45.520
destroying Western civilization

29:45.520 --> 29:47.520
with our authoritarian pronouns.

29:47.520 --> 29:48.520
It's hard to express just

29:48.520 --> 29:50.520
the daily humiliation

29:50.520 --> 29:52.520
of being a trans woman under these conditions.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.520
And then there's the little jabs people throw at you,

29:54.520 --> 29:57.520
like my laser technician recently told me,

29:57.520 --> 29:59.520
you must be very courageous to transition

29:59.520 --> 30:02.520
because that is not socially acceptable.

30:02.520 --> 30:04.520
And then she went back to blasting laser beams

30:04.520 --> 30:05.520
into my asshole.

30:05.520 --> 30:06.520
And then there's the internet,

30:06.520 --> 30:07.520
where, you know,

30:07.520 --> 30:09.520
I used to spend most of my life

30:09.520 --> 30:10.520
before the sadness took over.

30:10.520 --> 30:11.520
And I'm sure we all know

30:11.520 --> 30:12.520
that people on the internet

30:12.520 --> 30:14.520
are a wretched, wretched horde

30:14.520 --> 30:16.520
of bigoted attack helicopters.

30:16.520 --> 30:17.520
The whole point of this channel

30:17.520 --> 30:19.520
is I try to talk sense to these people.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.520
I talk to the TERFs and the conservatives

30:21.520 --> 30:23.520
and I try to empathize with their point of view

30:23.520 --> 30:25.520
and provide a rational response.

30:25.520 --> 30:27.520
But a side effect of all that research

30:27.520 --> 30:29.520
is I've acquired a burgeoning vocabulary

30:29.520 --> 30:30.520
of self-loathing.

30:30.520 --> 30:32.520
It's seeped into my brain

30:32.520 --> 30:34.520
and become a part of me.

30:34.520 --> 30:36.520
And this lifelong buildup of shame

30:36.520 --> 30:37.520
has become a wound

30:37.520 --> 30:39.520
at the heart of my existence.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.520
And all I can really do about it is

30:41.520 --> 30:44.520
compensate by wearing fancy clothes.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.520
I may be trash,

30:45.520 --> 30:47.520
but I am a genius.

30:47.520 --> 30:49.520
I am majestic trash.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.520
I am resplendent trash.

30:51.520 --> 30:52.520
I am couture trash.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.520
And I just bought

30:54.520 --> 30:56.520
a mid-century gold-trimmed

30:56.520 --> 30:59.520
Venetian blown glass decanter,

30:59.520 --> 31:00.520
which helps me forget

31:00.520 --> 31:01.520
the shame and self-loathing

31:01.520 --> 31:03.520
that plagues my every moment.

31:03.520 --> 31:04.520
Now, I'm guessing

31:04.520 --> 31:06.520
that a lot of people will be confused

31:06.520 --> 31:08.520
about why I'm so ashamed of being gay

31:08.520 --> 31:10.520
when I've already come out as trans,

31:10.520 --> 31:12.520
which seems like a bigger deal.

31:12.520 --> 31:14.520
To paraphrase what some people have told me,

31:14.520 --> 31:16.520
you're already a transgendered

31:16.520 --> 31:17.520
and a freak's a freak,

31:17.520 --> 31:19.520
so who cares what kind of freak?

31:19.520 --> 31:20.520
Well, first of all,

31:20.520 --> 31:21.520
I would like to propose

31:21.520 --> 31:23.520
a sociological theory.

31:23.520 --> 31:24.520
Tiffany's Law.

31:24.520 --> 31:25.520
All freaks

31:25.520 --> 31:27.520
have a deep psychological need

31:27.520 --> 31:28.520
to feel superior

31:28.520 --> 31:30.520
to a different type of freak.

31:30.520 --> 31:31.520
And trans lesbians

31:31.520 --> 31:33.520
are pretty close to the bottom

31:33.520 --> 31:34.520
of that packing order.

31:34.520 --> 31:35.520
Who's even left for me

31:35.520 --> 31:36.520
to feel superior to?

31:36.520 --> 31:37.520
The goddamn Belgians?

31:37.520 --> 31:39.520
Fuck this waffle.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.520
Second,

31:40.520 --> 31:41.520
coming out as trans

31:41.520 --> 31:42.520
wasn't as hard for me

31:42.520 --> 31:43.520
because I did it incrementally

31:43.520 --> 31:45.520
over like eight years.

31:45.520 --> 31:46.520
At first,

31:46.520 --> 31:47.520
I was like,

31:47.520 --> 31:48.520
well,

31:48.520 --> 31:49.520
I'm just a man

31:49.520 --> 31:50.520
who wears makeup sometimes.

31:50.520 --> 31:51.520
Then I was like,

31:51.520 --> 31:52.520
actually,

31:52.520 --> 31:53.520
it's not just clothes and makeup.

31:53.520 --> 31:54.520
I'm actually pretty gender nonconforming

31:54.520 --> 31:55.520
in a lot of ways.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.520
And then I realized

31:56.520 --> 31:57.520
I'm not a man at all

31:57.520 --> 31:58.520
and I identified as nonbinary.

31:58.520 --> 32:00.520
Then I started taking hormones.

32:00.520 --> 32:01.520
In two months on HRT,

32:01.520 --> 32:03.520
I woke up one day and said,

32:03.520 --> 32:04.520
it's fine.

32:04.520 --> 32:05.520
I am literally a woman.

32:05.520 --> 32:06.520
So by the time

32:06.520 --> 32:07.520
I actually came out

32:07.520 --> 32:08.520
as a trans woman,

32:08.520 --> 32:10.520
that was actually a step up

32:10.520 --> 32:11.520
in terms of social acceptability

32:11.520 --> 32:13.520
from where I was before.

32:13.520 --> 32:14.520
When I was a genderqueer genderfuck,

32:14.520 --> 32:15.520
I felt like

32:15.520 --> 32:16.520
I didn't fit in anywhere.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.520
Whereas

32:17.520 --> 32:18.520
when I started transitioning

32:18.520 --> 32:19.520
to female,

32:19.520 --> 32:20.520
even though at first

32:20.520 --> 32:21.520
I had a lot of the same problems,

32:21.520 --> 32:22.520
there was at least

32:22.520 --> 32:24.520
a goal in mind,

32:24.520 --> 32:26.520
some possible future

32:26.520 --> 32:27.520
where I could lead

32:27.520 --> 32:28.520
a normal-ish life as a woman.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.520
So the moment

32:29.520 --> 32:30.520
I started identifying

32:30.520 --> 32:31.520
as a woman

32:31.520 --> 32:32.520
was the moment

32:32.520 --> 32:33.520
the compet voice

32:33.520 --> 32:34.520
entered my head.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.520
Sure,

32:35.520 --> 32:36.520
I've never been very attracted

32:36.520 --> 32:37.520
to men before,

32:37.520 --> 32:38.520
but maybe I'm attracted

32:38.520 --> 32:39.520
to them now.

32:39.520 --> 32:40.520
I'm a woman, right?

32:40.520 --> 32:41.520
I've always been

32:41.520 --> 32:42.520
a little bi-curious

32:42.520 --> 32:43.520
and there was that time

32:43.520 --> 32:44.520
I kissed a boy

32:44.520 --> 32:45.520
when I was drunk.

32:45.520 --> 32:46.520
Let's choose some boys

32:46.520 --> 32:47.520
to be attracted to

32:47.520 --> 32:48.520
and get started on this.

32:48.520 --> 32:49.520
Of course,

32:49.520 --> 32:50.520
I wasn't as self-aware

32:50.520 --> 32:51.520
as that.

32:51.520 --> 32:52.520
My way of explaining it

32:52.520 --> 32:53.520
to myself was,

32:53.520 --> 32:54.520
I guess,

32:54.520 --> 32:55.520
hormones just magically

32:55.520 --> 32:56.520
changed my sexual orientation

32:56.520 --> 32:57.520
to the socially acceptable one.

32:57.520 --> 32:58.520
That's super friggin crazy.

32:58.520 --> 32:59.520
Shut up,

32:59.520 --> 33:00.520
you goddamn lesbo.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.520
God,

33:01.520 --> 33:02.520
there's so much pressure

33:02.520 --> 33:03.520
on trans women

33:03.520 --> 33:04.520
to be extremely

33:04.520 --> 33:05.520
gender conforming,

33:05.520 --> 33:06.520
and even more so

33:06.520 --> 33:07.520
if you're a representative

33:07.520 --> 33:08.520
of the community.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.520
You feel like

33:09.520 --> 33:10.520
you have to be

33:10.520 --> 33:11.520
a Stepford wife

33:11.520 --> 33:12.520
or else cis people

33:12.520 --> 33:13.520
are gonna throw us all

33:13.520 --> 33:14.520
in camps.

33:14.520 --> 33:15.520
And early in my transition,

33:15.520 --> 33:16.520
I kind of worshipped

33:16.520 --> 33:17.520
straight trans women.

33:17.520 --> 33:18.520
Like,

33:18.520 --> 33:19.520
I looked up to them

33:19.520 --> 33:20.520
and I wanted to be

33:20.520 --> 33:21.520
just like them.

33:21.520 --> 33:22.520
Now back then,

33:22.520 --> 33:23.520
there were a handful

33:23.520 --> 33:24.520
of trans lesbians

33:24.520 --> 33:25.520
on YouTube

33:25.520 --> 33:26.520
trying to make the case

33:26.520 --> 33:27.520
to the masses

33:27.520 --> 33:28.520
that being a trans lesbian

33:28.520 --> 33:29.520
is a legitimate thing.

33:29.520 --> 33:30.520
But in 2017,

33:30.520 --> 33:31.520
sweaty,

33:31.520 --> 33:32.520
the masses

33:32.520 --> 33:33.520
were not having it.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.520
I watched those women

33:34.520 --> 33:35.520
get eaten alive.

33:35.520 --> 33:36.520
And as a result

33:36.520 --> 33:37.520
of my witnessing that

33:37.520 --> 33:38.520
at a super fucking

33:38.520 --> 33:39.520
vulnerable moment for me,

33:39.520 --> 33:41.520
I internalized the message

33:41.520 --> 33:43.520
that a trans lesbian

33:43.520 --> 33:44.520
is just

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
not an okay

33:45.520 --> 33:46.520
thing to be

33:46.520 --> 33:47.520
if you want to be tolerated

33:47.520 --> 33:48.520
or respected

33:48.520 --> 33:49.520
by anybody other than

33:49.520 --> 33:50.520
a handful of communists.

33:50.520 --> 33:51.520
So I began my transition

33:51.520 --> 33:52.520
with essentially

33:52.520 --> 33:53.520
no role model

33:53.520 --> 33:54.520
of a widely respected

33:54.520 --> 33:55.520
and admired

33:55.520 --> 33:56.520
trans lesbian.

33:56.520 --> 33:57.520
And it doesn't help

33:57.520 --> 33:58.520
that most forms

33:58.520 --> 33:59.520
of transphobia

33:59.520 --> 34:00.520
are harsher

34:00.520 --> 34:01.520
on gay trans women

34:01.520 --> 34:02.520
than they are

34:02.520 --> 34:03.520
on straight trans women.

34:03.520 --> 34:04.520
Like take this trope

34:04.520 --> 34:05.520
that trans women

34:05.520 --> 34:06.520
are men

34:06.520 --> 34:07.520
who transition

34:07.520 --> 34:08.520
to creep on women

34:08.520 --> 34:09.520
in bathrooms.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.520
In response to that,

34:10.520 --> 34:11.520
it feels really good

34:11.520 --> 34:12.520
to be able to say

34:12.520 --> 34:13.520
I'm not even attracted

34:13.520 --> 34:14.520
to this petite

34:14.520 --> 34:15.520
heterosexual bio girl.

34:15.520 --> 34:16.520
I'm surely not

34:16.520 --> 34:17.520
some kind of

34:17.520 --> 34:18.520
six foot monster

34:18.520 --> 34:19.520
who likes women.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.520
Shame.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.520
Shame.

34:22.520 --> 34:23.520
It does make me feel

34:23.520 --> 34:24.520
like a monster sometimes,

34:24.520 --> 34:25.520
like a mutant

34:25.520 --> 34:26.520
that has no place

34:26.520 --> 34:27.520
in society.

34:27.520 --> 34:28.520
And this shame

34:28.520 --> 34:29.520
has actually made it

34:29.520 --> 34:30.520
more difficult

34:30.520 --> 34:31.520
for me to accept

34:31.520 --> 34:32.520
that I'm a gay woman

34:32.520 --> 34:33.520
than it was for me

34:33.520 --> 34:34.520
to come out as trans

34:34.520 --> 34:35.520
in the first place.

34:35.520 --> 34:36.520
It's like I made

34:36.520 --> 34:37.520
a kind of subconscious

34:37.520 --> 34:38.520
bargain

34:38.520 --> 34:39.520
where I traded

34:39.520 --> 34:40.520
my sexual orientation

34:40.520 --> 34:41.520
for my gender identity.

34:41.520 --> 34:42.520
So I finally transitioned

34:42.520 --> 34:43.520
only to spend

34:43.520 --> 34:44.520
a different kind

34:44.520 --> 34:45.520
of denial.

34:45.520 --> 34:46.520
And that denial

34:46.520 --> 34:47.520
got pretty deep

34:47.520 --> 34:48.520
and pretty dark.

34:48.520 --> 34:49.520
This is painful

34:49.520 --> 34:50.520
and incriminating

34:50.520 --> 34:51.520
to admit,

34:51.520 --> 34:52.520
but not all of my shame

34:52.520 --> 34:53.520
came from external bigotry.

34:53.520 --> 34:54.520
Some of it came

34:54.520 --> 34:55.520
from my own judgment

34:55.520 --> 34:56.520
and disgust

34:56.520 --> 34:57.520
toward things

34:57.520 --> 34:58.520
I saw trans lesbians

34:58.520 --> 34:59.520
doing.

34:59.520 --> 35:00.520
Like this anime

35:00.520 --> 35:01.520
cat girl shit

35:01.520 --> 35:02.520
which clearly

35:02.520 --> 35:03.520
gets under my skin

35:03.520 --> 35:04.520
and not just because

35:04.520 --> 35:05.520
these people

35:05.520 --> 35:06.520
have been harassing me

35:06.520 --> 35:07.520
for three years.

35:07.520 --> 35:08.520
Like you see it

35:08.520 --> 35:09.520
all over trans Twitter

35:09.520 --> 35:10.520
and Reddit,

35:10.520 --> 35:11.520
this queasy combination

35:11.520 --> 35:12.520
of the hypersexual

35:12.520 --> 35:13.520
and the infantile.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.520
I'm a heckin'

35:14.520 --> 35:15.520
cat girl lesbian

35:15.520 --> 35:16.520
cum slut.

35:16.520 --> 35:17.520
Meow meow,

35:17.520 --> 35:18.520
girl dick,

35:18.520 --> 35:19.520
nya nya.

35:19.520 --> 35:20.520
Here's the 97th picture

35:20.520 --> 35:21.520
of my own legs

35:21.520 --> 35:22.520
and thigh-high

35:22.520 --> 35:23.520
stripey socks uwu.

35:23.520 --> 35:24.520
What is that about?

35:24.520 --> 35:26.520
Is this how women act?

35:26.520 --> 35:27.520
Cis people are gonna

35:27.520 --> 35:28.520
see this.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.520
They're not gonna

35:29.520 --> 35:30.520
let us into women's spaces

35:30.520 --> 35:31.520
if we act like that.

35:31.520 --> 35:32.520
Now I'm not proud

35:32.520 --> 35:33.520
of having these

35:33.520 --> 35:34.520
judgmental feelings,

35:34.520 --> 35:35.520
but I confess

35:35.520 --> 35:36.520
to periodically

35:36.520 --> 35:37.520
sinking into

35:37.520 --> 35:38.520
these morbid

35:38.520 --> 35:39.520
guilty binges

35:39.520 --> 35:40.520
of cringing

35:40.520 --> 35:41.520
at embarrassing

35:41.520 --> 35:42.520
trans lesbians

35:42.520 --> 35:43.520
and if I was

35:43.520 --> 35:44.520
a different type

35:44.520 --> 35:45.520
of YouTuber

35:45.520 --> 35:46.520
I could've turned

35:46.520 --> 35:47.520
this into content.

35:47.520 --> 35:48.520
At my worst

35:48.520 --> 35:49.520
I would sit there

35:49.520 --> 35:50.520
telling another

35:50.520 --> 35:51.520
trans person

35:51.520 --> 35:52.520
why are trans lesbians

35:52.520 --> 35:53.520
so cringey

35:53.520 --> 35:54.520
they're making things

35:54.520 --> 35:55.520
harder for the rest

35:55.520 --> 35:56.520
of us girls.

35:56.520 --> 35:57.520
And that's

35:57.520 --> 35:58.520
the real darkness

35:58.520 --> 35:59.520
isn't it?

35:59.520 --> 36:00.520
Not even having

36:00.520 --> 36:01.520
the decency

36:01.520 --> 36:02.520
to openly

36:02.520 --> 36:03.520
despise yourself

36:03.520 --> 36:04.520
like an honest American.

36:04.520 --> 36:05.520
No,

36:05.520 --> 36:06.520
just sitting there

36:06.520 --> 36:07.520
in absurd denial

36:07.520 --> 36:08.520
of who you are

36:08.520 --> 36:09.520
as a person

36:09.520 --> 36:10.520
disparaging

36:10.520 --> 36:11.520
your own repressed

36:11.520 --> 36:12.520
identity to anyone

36:12.520 --> 36:13.520
I'm ashamed

36:13.520 --> 36:14.520
I sunk that low

36:14.520 --> 36:15.520
but all you can do

36:15.520 --> 36:16.520
is try to get better

36:16.520 --> 36:17.520
and I'm trying

36:17.520 --> 36:18.520
to get better

36:18.520 --> 36:19.520
I've broken free

36:19.520 --> 36:20.520
of the denial

36:20.520 --> 36:21.520
and now I have

36:21.520 --> 36:22.520
to break free

36:22.520 --> 36:23.520
of the shame

36:23.520 --> 36:24.520
because shame

36:24.520 --> 36:25.520
is literally

36:25.520 --> 36:26.520
ruining my life.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.520
I told Joanne

36:27.520 --> 36:28.520
I was working

36:28.520 --> 36:29.520
on a video

36:29.520 --> 36:30.520
about shame

36:30.520 --> 36:31.520
and she said

36:31.520 --> 36:32.520
I might want

36:32.520 --> 36:33.520
to mention

36:33.520 --> 36:34.520
that one of the reasons

36:34.520 --> 36:35.520
she didn't want

36:35.520 --> 36:36.520
to be with me

36:36.520 --> 36:37.520
is she'd be ashamed

36:37.520 --> 36:38.520
to date another

36:38.520 --> 36:39.520
trans woman.

36:39.520 --> 36:40.520
She said she feels

36:40.520 --> 36:41.520
like relationships

36:41.520 --> 36:42.520
are a freakish behavior

36:42.520 --> 36:43.520
on the outskirts

36:43.520 --> 36:44.520
of society

36:44.520 --> 36:45.520
with no attempt

36:45.520 --> 36:46.520
to integrate.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.520
These are very painful

36:47.520 --> 36:48.520
words to hear

36:48.520 --> 36:49.520
from the woman

36:49.520 --> 36:50.520
you're in love with

36:50.520 --> 36:51.520
but I understand

36:51.520 --> 36:52.520
why she feels

36:52.520 --> 36:53.520
that way.

36:53.520 --> 36:54.520
Joanne gets validation

36:54.520 --> 36:55.520
from dating cis men

36:55.520 --> 36:56.520
or cis women

36:56.520 --> 36:57.520
but I

36:57.520 --> 36:58.520
can't be the hinge

36:58.520 --> 36:59.520
that connects her

36:59.520 --> 37:00.520
to mainstream society

37:00.520 --> 37:01.520
and it's maddening

37:01.520 --> 37:02.520
to me that she feels

37:02.520 --> 37:03.520
that way

37:03.520 --> 37:04.520
because I would have

37:04.520 --> 37:05.520
chosen her

37:05.520 --> 37:06.520
over every cis woman

37:06.520 --> 37:07.520
in the world

37:07.520 --> 37:08.520
but I'm just another

37:08.520 --> 37:09.520
worthless freak

37:09.520 --> 37:10.520
without the authority

37:10.520 --> 37:11.520
of my love

37:11.520 --> 37:12.520
doesn't count.

37:12.520 --> 37:13.520
Shame.

37:13.520 --> 37:14.520
It poisons

37:14.520 --> 37:15.520
the soul.

37:15.520 --> 37:16.520
You know who you love

37:16.520 --> 37:17.520
just like what gender

37:17.520 --> 37:18.520
you are

37:18.520 --> 37:19.520
is such a basic

37:19.520 --> 37:20.520
part of your humanity

37:20.520 --> 37:21.520
and shame

37:21.520 --> 37:22.520
about that

37:22.520 --> 37:23.520
cuts to the core

37:23.520 --> 37:24.520
of your being.

37:24.520 --> 37:25.520
It's not

37:25.520 --> 37:26.520
I'm ashamed

37:26.520 --> 37:27.520
of what I did

37:27.520 --> 37:28.520
it's not

37:28.520 --> 37:29.520
I'm ashamed

37:29.520 --> 37:30.520
of how I feel

37:30.520 --> 37:31.520
it's I'm ashamed

37:31.520 --> 37:32.520
of who and what

37:32.520 --> 37:33.520
I am

37:33.520 --> 37:34.520
and living

37:34.520 --> 37:35.520
in that state of mind

37:35.520 --> 37:36.520
is garbage

37:36.520 --> 37:37.520
it's basically

37:37.520 --> 37:38.520
hell.

37:38.520 --> 37:39.520
Even after I realized

37:39.520 --> 37:40.520
my sexuality

37:40.520 --> 37:41.520
shoving that shit

37:41.520 --> 37:42.520
back down

37:42.520 --> 37:43.520
never coming out

37:43.520 --> 37:44.520
I have all these

37:44.520 --> 37:45.520
fears about it

37:45.520 --> 37:46.520
I'm worried

37:46.520 --> 37:47.520
people will take my gender

37:47.520 --> 37:48.520
less seriously

37:48.520 --> 37:49.520
I'm worried

37:49.520 --> 37:50.520
cis women

37:50.520 --> 37:51.520
or straight women

37:51.520 --> 37:52.520
I'm friends with

37:52.520 --> 37:53.520
will get weird about it

37:53.520 --> 37:54.520
I'm worried

37:54.520 --> 37:55.520
I'll die a lonely

37:55.520 --> 37:56.520
useless lesbian

37:56.520 --> 37:57.520
in which case

37:57.520 --> 37:58.520
I should have just

37:58.520 --> 37:59.520
married a man

37:59.520 --> 38:00.520
cause at least then

38:00.520 --> 38:01.520
there'd be someone

38:01.520 --> 38:02.520
to kill the spiders

38:02.520 --> 38:03.520
and fix the fucking sink

38:03.520 --> 38:04.520
I'm worried

38:04.520 --> 38:05.520
I'll lose my straight male

38:05.520 --> 38:06.520
audience on YouTube

38:06.520 --> 38:07.520
although

38:07.520 --> 38:08.520
I mean

38:08.520 --> 38:09.520
love you boys

38:09.520 --> 38:10.520
I'll be fine

38:10.520 --> 38:11.520
without you

38:11.520 --> 38:12.520
and in any case

38:12.520 --> 38:13.520
when has a woman's

38:13.520 --> 38:14.520
being a lesbian

38:14.520 --> 38:15.520
ever stopped a man

38:15.520 --> 38:16.520
from taking a swing at it

38:16.520 --> 38:17.520
I actually thought about

38:17.520 --> 38:18.520
marrying a man anyway

38:18.520 --> 38:19.520
just sacrificing

38:19.520 --> 38:20.520
my sexual orientation

38:20.520 --> 38:21.520
to regain

38:21.520 --> 38:22.520
that safe

38:22.520 --> 38:23.520
comfortable

38:23.520 --> 38:24.520
shameless

38:24.520 --> 38:25.520
feeling

38:25.520 --> 38:26.520
I used to have

38:26.520 --> 38:27.520
when walking down the street

38:27.520 --> 38:28.520
holding Chad's hand

38:28.520 --> 38:29.520
feeling like I'd succeeded

38:29.520 --> 38:30.520
as a woman

38:30.520 --> 38:31.520
but if I don't deal

38:31.520 --> 38:32.520
with this now

38:32.520 --> 38:33.520
and work towards

38:33.520 --> 38:34.520
accepting myself

38:34.520 --> 38:35.520
then I'm just gonna be

38:35.520 --> 38:36.520
in the same situation

38:36.520 --> 38:37.520
in 10 years

38:37.520 --> 38:38.520
when I'm 41 years old

38:38.520 --> 38:39.520
and married to a man

38:39.520 --> 38:40.520
with the same feelings

38:40.520 --> 38:41.520
so it's time for this

38:41.520 --> 38:42.520
to stop

38:42.520 --> 38:43.520
because literally

38:43.520 --> 38:44.520
the only good thing

38:44.520 --> 38:45.520
about being gay

38:45.520 --> 38:46.520
is doing gay shit

38:46.520 --> 38:47.520
and as long as I'm ashamed

38:47.520 --> 38:48.520
of my sexuality

38:48.520 --> 38:49.520
no one's gonna wanna

38:49.520 --> 38:50.520
do gay shit with me

38:50.520 --> 38:51.520
as I like to say

38:51.520 --> 38:52.520
if you can't love yourself

38:52.520 --> 38:53.520
how in the hell

38:53.520 --> 38:54.520
are you gonna prop up

38:54.520 --> 38:55.520
your narcissistic delusions

38:55.520 --> 38:56.520
look I'm trying

38:56.520 --> 38:57.520
to stay positive

38:57.520 --> 38:58.520
maybe everyone hates

38:58.520 --> 38:59.520
trans lesbians now

38:59.520 --> 39:00.520
but just you wait

39:00.520 --> 39:01.520
we all know

39:01.520 --> 39:02.520
how trends work

39:02.520 --> 39:03.520
in 10 years

39:03.520 --> 39:04.520
being a trans lesbian

39:04.520 --> 39:05.520
will be the coolest

39:05.520 --> 39:06.520
hippest

39:06.520 --> 39:07.520
chicest

39:07.520 --> 39:08.520
thing imaginable

39:08.520 --> 39:09.520
and all the people

39:09.520 --> 39:10.520
who love it now

39:10.520 --> 39:11.520
will forget

39:11.520 --> 39:12.520
they ever said a word

39:12.520 --> 39:13.520
that's right

39:13.520 --> 39:14.520
even the straight trans girls

39:14.520 --> 39:15.520
will be making out

39:15.520 --> 39:16.520
with each other

39:16.520 --> 39:17.520
just for the clout

39:17.520 --> 39:18.520
like we can be lesbians

39:18.520 --> 39:19.520
too

39:19.520 --> 39:20.520
we are edgy

39:20.520 --> 39:21.520
oh

39:21.520 --> 39:22.520
it's gonna be

39:22.520 --> 39:23.520
Madonna and Britney

39:23.520 --> 39:24.520
at the 2003 VMAs

39:24.520 --> 39:25.520
all over again

39:25.520 --> 39:26.520
mark my words

39:26.520 --> 39:27.520
and among cis lesbians

39:27.520 --> 39:28.520
oh

39:28.520 --> 39:29.520
it will actually be

39:29.520 --> 39:30.520
a sign of prestige

39:30.520 --> 39:32.520
to have a trap waifu

39:32.520 --> 39:33.520
I can dream right

39:33.520 --> 39:34.520
once you've tasted

39:34.520 --> 39:35.520
one forbidden fruit

39:35.520 --> 39:36.520
why stop there

39:39.520 --> 39:40.520
because they'll be

39:40.520 --> 39:41.520
fine

39:41.520 --> 39:42.520
oh my god

39:42.520 --> 39:43.460
you've got a bomb

39:43.460 --> 39:43.520
nggak

39:43.520 --> 39:44.520
nothing can stop

39:44.520 --> 39:45.520
me

39:45.520 --> 39:46.520
gotta go

39:46.520 --> 39:47.520
you only do

39:47.520 --> 39:48.520
what you gotta do

39:48.520 --> 39:49.520
or else

39:49.520 --> 39:50.020
I'll fall

39:50.020 --> 39:50.520
and if it's

39:50.520 --> 39:51.520
really speed

39:51.520 --> 39:52.520
like where are you
