00:00.000 --> 00:05.960
In 2009, James O'Keefe hoodwinked a number of media outlets, activists, and politicians

00:05.960 --> 00:10.980
when he circulated recordings he had secretly made of employees working at Acorn.

00:10.980 --> 00:16.000
In the recordings, a disguised O'Keefe and his associate, Hannah Giles, got advice on

00:16.000 --> 00:21.240
everything from how to avoid paying a pimp to effectively trafficking children across

00:21.240 --> 00:23.520
the US-Mexico border.

00:23.520 --> 00:28.720
What O'Keefe kept secret is that this footage was heavily edited and completely misrepresents

00:28.720 --> 00:30.440
the discussions he had.

00:30.440 --> 00:34.920
The Acorn workers, in many cases, were simply playing along with O'Keefe, and after the

00:34.920 --> 00:41.600
conversations alerted police to his activities, they weren't actively giving advice to criminals.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.720
Unfortunately, the doctored tapes were enough to convince conservative media outlets that

00:45.720 --> 00:50.440
Acorn was an agency committed to helping child traffickers and street pimps.

00:50.440 --> 00:54.640
The backlash was enough to scare the US Census Bureau and the IRS into terminating their

00:54.640 --> 00:56.300
contracts with Acorn.

00:56.300 --> 01:02.460
By November of 2010, Acorn had to liquidate all of its assets and closed up for good.

01:02.460 --> 01:05.640
How did this deceptive footage convince so many people?

01:05.640 --> 01:09.300
And how did a phony journalist like O'Keefe seem so credible?

01:09.300 --> 01:14.160
The hidden camera tactic has long been a favorite of news outlets, and the O'Keefe tapes cashed

01:14.160 --> 01:16.320
in on that well-accepted strategy.

01:16.320 --> 01:21.080
By adopting the appearance of a genuine journalist, he was able to falsify a degree of credibility

01:21.080 --> 01:25.200
he never had and advance his particular conservative agenda.

01:25.200 --> 01:29.920
In this case, shutting down a non-profit that helped register voters in low and moderate

01:29.920 --> 01:31.840
income neighborhoods.

01:31.840 --> 01:35.880
Pretending to be a reporter covering a story is the perfect disguise for anyone who has

01:35.880 --> 01:37.280
an agenda to push.

01:37.280 --> 01:41.860
They simply need to look the part and engage what appears to be journalism, all the while

01:41.860 --> 01:47.120
leaving out facts, editing out context, and providing commentary that distorts reality

01:47.120 --> 01:48.480
to fit their worldview.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.240
And that brings us to Lauren Southern.

01:56.200 --> 02:01.080
Lauren's Southern is a great example of someone creating narrative-driven pseudo-journalism

02:01.080 --> 02:03.900
that poisons our understanding of the world.

02:03.900 --> 02:08.220
In demonstrating how this type of pseudo-journalism works, I want to take a quick trip through

02:08.220 --> 02:13.040
Southern's career and the many tactics she's employed to push her particular narrative.

02:13.040 --> 02:17.820
That narrative being a mix of nationalism, white victimhood, and a desire to pull the

02:17.820 --> 02:21.120
Western world back to the 1950s.

02:21.120 --> 02:26.000
But to understand where Southern came from, we have to talk about the Toronto Sun.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.040
This daily newspaper launched in Toronto in 1971 and became a prominent voice for conservative

02:31.040 --> 02:32.040
news in the city.

02:32.040 --> 02:38.260
A tabloid both in its format and content, the Toronto Sun eventually spread to television.

02:38.260 --> 02:43.720
The cable news channel, The Sun News Network, launched in 2011.

02:43.720 --> 02:48.240
Its format was similar to Fox News, where it had reporting on during the day and commentary

02:48.240 --> 02:49.240
on in the evening.

02:51.120 --> 03:01.320
The channel did not do well.

03:01.320 --> 03:07.440
In three years, it lost $46.7 million dollars Canadian, and by 2015, it went off the air.

03:07.440 --> 03:10.480
But the story of the conservative channel didn't end there.

03:10.480 --> 03:15.680
One of the personalities of The Sun News Network was a conservative commentator named Ezrilevant,

03:15.680 --> 03:19.920
the nationally known champion of free speech.

03:19.920 --> 03:23.960
For those who don't know, Ezrilevant is a cheery fellow who is best known across Canada

03:23.960 --> 03:28.580
for his defense of free speech, most notably when he has to defend his own free speech

03:28.580 --> 03:33.320
when he sued for libel or when he sues newspapers for publishing the details of the horrible

03:33.320 --> 03:34.560
things he says.

03:34.560 --> 03:39.400
Three days after Sun News Network was shut down, Ezrilevant launched the YouTube channel,

03:39.400 --> 03:40.640
The Rebel Media.

03:40.640 --> 03:46.080
The Rebel Media has been home to many odious faces, such as white genocide conspiracy theorist

03:46.080 --> 03:52.880
Faith Goldie, white genocide conspiracy theorist Gavin McInnes, and great replacement conspiracy

03:52.880 --> 03:54.720
theorist Lawrence Southern.

03:54.720 --> 03:57.920
The great replacement is a code word for white genocide.

03:57.920 --> 04:01.640
For the record, all three of these people have left The Rebel Media, but it was the

04:01.640 --> 04:04.160
platform that propelled them into the limelight.

04:04.160 --> 04:08.400
So it's important to know to understand why we have these characters running around making

04:08.400 --> 04:11.320
the world a generally shittier place.

04:11.320 --> 04:14.720
Which brings us back to Lawrence Southern, who was recruited by Levant when he noticed

04:14.720 --> 04:16.400
her at a conference he had organized.

04:16.400 --> 04:21.800
Levant was apparently impressed by the tough questions she was asking during a panel discussion,

04:21.800 --> 04:25.120
and later on he gave her a spot with The Rebel Media when it opened.

04:25.120 --> 04:29.560
In time, she became one of the YouTube channel's biggest stars, appearing in incredibly successful

04:29.560 --> 04:34.160
videos that, at first glance, have the appearance of journalism.

04:34.160 --> 04:41.280
Until you look a little closer.

04:41.280 --> 04:46.640
Lawrence Southern made her big internet debut in June of 2015, when she starred in a video

04:46.640 --> 04:52.960
titled Lauren Southern Clashes with Feminists at Slutwalk.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.680
Filmed at a Slutwalk in Vancouver, British Columbia, the video features Southern breathlessly

04:57.680 --> 05:03.000
walking around asking questions of the participants, a tactic you often see used by real journalists

05:03.000 --> 05:05.400
on a wide number of different outlets.

05:05.400 --> 05:10.200
But much like the undercover O'Keefe tapes, copying the style of real journalists doesn't

05:10.200 --> 05:13.040
make what you're producing real journalism.

05:13.040 --> 05:17.960
For an example of real journalism, of the on-the-ground variety, here's a video covering

05:17.960 --> 05:23.800
the Umbrella Revolution protests of 2014 in Hong Kong, as reported by Phoebe Greenwood

05:23.800 --> 05:24.800
for The Guardian.

05:24.800 --> 05:27.960
This is Admiralty in Hong Kong.

05:27.960 --> 05:31.360
It is the heart of the Umbrella Movement, which is now in its seventh day.

05:31.360 --> 05:36.200
Tens of thousands of people have come to the streets here, asking Beijing to allow them

05:36.200 --> 05:39.680
a greater democratic say in who leads them.

05:39.680 --> 05:41.840
It's an extraordinarily peaceful movement.

05:41.840 --> 05:46.840
It's perhaps the most polite bunch of protesters I've ever come across, but tonight is the

05:46.840 --> 05:52.300
deadline that they've given the chief executive, C. Y. Leung, to resign.

05:52.300 --> 05:56.480
No one here really thinks that he will, but no one here really knows what will happen

05:56.480 --> 05:57.480
if he doesn't.

05:57.480 --> 06:00.000
Now, this is a great opening.

06:00.000 --> 06:04.040
Greenwood presents the video of the protesters and provides some context for why the protest

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
is happening.

06:05.040 --> 06:09.280
You really feel like you just learned something about the politics of Hong Kong and the people

06:09.280 --> 06:12.400
who live there, and all of that's just in the opener.

06:12.400 --> 06:18.180
Now, let's compare this to Lauren Southern's supposed report on the 2015 Vancouver Slut

06:18.180 --> 06:19.180
Walk.

06:19.180 --> 06:22.920
Hello, it's Lauren Southern here with Rebel, and I've just gotten a huge confrontation

06:22.920 --> 06:26.040
with the Slut Walk, which we are following right now.

06:26.040 --> 06:32.800
Essentially, I held a sign that said, we are not living in a rape culture in the West,

06:32.800 --> 06:33.800
which we are not.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.960
It is intellectually dishonest to think that we are living in a rape culture.

06:37.960 --> 06:42.680
Rapists do happen, but the majority or the minority, the vast minority of men and women

06:42.680 --> 06:43.680
are rapists.

06:43.680 --> 06:47.360
And when we do find out they're rapists, they go to prison, they are punished.

06:47.360 --> 06:53.360
Whereas in the third world countries and other places, men can get away with rape there.

06:53.360 --> 06:59.640
And it's insane to focus on this one issue and say that we are living in a rape culture.

06:59.640 --> 07:00.640
Rapists don't get high fives.

07:00.640 --> 07:03.160
We don't have the government funding rapists.

07:03.160 --> 07:07.120
And men get fired from their jobs just for making rape jokes.

07:07.120 --> 07:08.320
Not even raping.

07:08.320 --> 07:11.600
So to say we live in a rape culture is quite frankly ridiculous.

07:11.600 --> 07:14.340
All right, let's go follow the walk.

07:14.340 --> 07:16.560
So there's a difference here.

07:16.560 --> 07:21.160
Southern immediately begins talking about herself and how her counter-protest wasn't

07:21.160 --> 07:22.680
warmly met.

07:22.680 --> 07:27.180
Southern also makes no effort to explain why the Slut Walk is happening or what the stated

07:27.180 --> 07:29.560
goals of the organizers are.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.020
He bare minimum when introducing a subject.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.260
He instead launches into a response about how wrong they are.

07:36.260 --> 07:40.420
A reporter not believing the claims of protesters is fine.

07:40.420 --> 07:44.960
But they have to first present the claims of the protesters, expanding on what protesters

07:44.960 --> 07:50.260
mean when they say rape culture and addressing criticisms to that explanation is far more

07:50.260 --> 07:54.260
useful than responding to what the reporter imagines they mean.

07:54.260 --> 07:55.780
Back to the Greenwood example.

07:55.780 --> 07:57.820
I really like this little snippet.

07:57.820 --> 07:59.940
Ah, you're recycling.

07:59.940 --> 08:03.780
You don't think violence can help us in any way?

08:03.780 --> 08:05.500
But recycling bottles can.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.180
Um, sort of.

08:07.180 --> 08:11.540
Now this question seems almost superfluous, but what it's subtly doing is presenting

08:11.540 --> 08:15.200
the innocence and perhaps naivete of the protesters.

08:15.200 --> 08:21.020
It could be interpreted as a subtextual criticism in expecting the notoriously anti-democratic

08:21.020 --> 08:25.460
Chinese federal government to respect the demands of the citizens of Hong Kong.

08:25.460 --> 08:29.860
But it also shows the importance of hope in a protest movement and the earnestness of

08:29.860 --> 08:31.180
the people involved.

08:31.180 --> 08:35.460
It's a simple question and a simple response, but it tells you quite a bit about the people

08:35.460 --> 08:36.460
there.

08:36.460 --> 08:39.940
Now contrast this with the segment in the rebel media clip.

08:39.940 --> 08:44.420
Well, how do you believe your outfit is going to stop perpetuating rape culture?

08:44.420 --> 08:45.420
It's my body.

08:45.420 --> 08:46.420
It's my choice.

08:46.420 --> 08:47.420
I can wear what I want.

08:47.420 --> 08:48.420
And it shouldn't.

08:48.420 --> 08:52.340
This is exemplifying how it's a crime scene, like wearing the caution tape that they would

08:52.340 --> 08:56.500
normally put around a physical crime scene with when it's not regarding a person, but

08:56.500 --> 08:57.780
regarding me.

08:58.780 --> 09:00.780
Regarding people, it's not considered a crime scene, that's f***ed up.

09:00.780 --> 09:01.780
It should be.

09:01.780 --> 09:03.780
It's a violation of a person's rights.

09:03.780 --> 09:06.380
So is this stopping rapes?

09:06.380 --> 09:11.940
Now this exchange was generally a train wreck, and it ended with a terrible loaded question.

09:11.940 --> 09:15.940
For those who aren't aware of what a loaded question is, it's one that often includes

09:15.940 --> 09:17.380
an unfair assumption.

09:17.380 --> 09:22.580
A popular example is if you ask someone, when did you stop beating your wife?

09:22.580 --> 09:27.740
The assumption in the question is that the person being asked abuses their wife.

09:27.740 --> 09:33.180
Being someone is your outfit stopping rapes, includes the assumption someone is dressing

09:33.180 --> 09:36.180
up to change the action of rapists.

09:36.180 --> 09:38.860
That's not why this woman is dressed up.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.460
She'll tell you why she dressed up.

09:40.460 --> 09:42.660
In fact, she did.

09:42.660 --> 09:44.300
Right before you ask that question.

09:44.300 --> 09:45.300
It's my body.

09:45.300 --> 09:46.300
It's my choice.

09:46.300 --> 09:47.300
I can wear what I want.

09:47.300 --> 09:48.300
And it shouldn't.

09:48.300 --> 09:50.540
This is exemplifying how it's a crime scene.

09:50.540 --> 09:55.380
If someone believes a rape culture is failing victims of rape and sexual assault, and providing

09:55.380 --> 09:59.740
cover for abusers and rapists, generating conversation would be a good way to address

09:59.740 --> 10:01.100
that problem.

10:01.100 --> 10:06.660
This is a conversation Southern could have actually engaged in, but she wasn't listening.

10:06.660 --> 10:11.220
She was more interested in asking a question that made her subject look silly.

10:11.220 --> 10:14.500
She didn't attend this protest report on the sled walk.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.460
She came to push an agenda.

10:16.460 --> 10:20.420
But I want to highlight this delicious little moment that happens immediately afterwards

10:20.420 --> 10:24.180
when another member of the sled walk confronts Southern with some heavy facts.

10:24.180 --> 10:27.460
I'm going to play the whole exchange because it's just great.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.580
Any stats to back up anything that you've said this afternoon?

10:30.580 --> 10:31.580
Absolutely.

10:31.580 --> 10:33.060
You said that rapists go to jail.

10:33.060 --> 10:36.580
Can you give me a stat to back that up based on the number of rapes that are reported,

10:36.580 --> 10:40.180
the number of rapes that get taken to the cops, the number of rapes that get prosecuted?

10:40.180 --> 10:42.980
Could you give me some stats to back up your pseudo reporting here?

10:42.980 --> 10:49.500
Well, first of all, out of the amount of rapes that happen out of 100,000 people, 1.7 of

10:49.500 --> 10:52.900
Canadians actually even just that's just reporting rapes.

10:53.460 --> 10:56.220
You know that less than 10% of rapes are actually reported.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.620
Okay, where's that?

10:57.620 --> 10:58.620
To the cops.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.900
It's from all of the women's organizations.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.260
You can look it up online.

11:02.260 --> 11:05.940
You can find it through the socialized organizations that study rape.

11:05.940 --> 11:09.460
I participate with an organization that works as a rape crisis center.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.220
We base that on the number of calls.

11:11.220 --> 11:16.380
The police know based on the unofficial reports, the third party reporting and the direct reports.

11:16.380 --> 11:19.860
This is not a secret that about 10% of rapes are reported.

11:19.860 --> 11:22.460
So how do you know 10% of rapes are reported if the others aren't?

11:23.060 --> 11:27.620
Because those people call the women's centers, they ask for help, they seek medical attention.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.620
So they are reported.

11:28.620 --> 11:32.580
And the segment ends with a response that's a bit of a gotcha that really just proves

11:32.580 --> 11:36.860
Southern isn't really engaging with what the person is saying.

11:36.860 --> 11:41.340
It basically evaded all of that useful information the woman in sunglasses gave.

11:41.340 --> 11:42.820
Look at the first thing she says.

11:42.820 --> 11:45.700
Less than 10% of rapes are actually reported.

11:45.700 --> 11:47.260
Okay, where's that?

11:47.260 --> 11:48.300
To the cops.

11:48.300 --> 11:52.340
And then she goes on to mention all the other avenues in which rape is reported.

11:53.340 --> 11:54.620
So they are reported.

11:54.620 --> 11:57.900
The two police part is the crucial difference here.

11:57.900 --> 12:02.060
A rape can't be prosecuted unless it's reported to the police.

12:02.060 --> 12:07.020
This woman is giving you evidence and a clear claim as to why police aren't hearing about

12:07.020 --> 12:09.740
the vast majority of rapes out there.

12:09.740 --> 12:14.140
Southern is either refusing to engage with the person she's interviewing or simply can't

12:14.140 --> 12:18.020
understand the point the woman in sunglasses is making.

12:18.020 --> 12:21.900
The last third of this video is dedicated to Southern's counter-protest and the response

12:21.900 --> 12:22.980
it generated.

12:22.980 --> 12:25.500
This is perhaps the most ridiculous part of the video.

12:25.500 --> 12:30.980
If you're truly there to report on something, how can you justify starting a second demonstration?

12:30.980 --> 12:34.620
You're no longer covering the story, you're part of the story.

12:34.620 --> 12:38.820
She ends the segment the same way it began, and nothing was learned.

12:38.820 --> 12:41.700
This video wasn't successfully reporting anything.

12:41.700 --> 12:45.980
Its only accomplishment was making Lauren Southern an internet star who advances a right-wing

12:45.980 --> 12:47.140
agenda.

12:47.140 --> 12:50.140
Take a look at how CBC News in Vancouver covered the story.

12:50.140 --> 12:53.900
And apologies for the quality, I got this off the channel of someone who doesn't know

12:53.900 --> 12:55.900
how to capture footage off a TV.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.580
Dozens gathered in front of the Vancouver Art Gallery this afternoon.

12:58.580 --> 13:02.860
Their hope was to raise awareness of victim blaming around sexual assault, many holding

13:02.860 --> 13:07.060
signs carrying messages about rape culture, a problem the group says is pervasive in our

13:07.060 --> 13:08.300
society.

13:08.300 --> 13:12.020
The things went sideways when one woman arrived with a message of her own.

13:12.020 --> 13:32.540
So, the story that was about the Slut Walk became a story about Lauren Southern, or

13:32.540 --> 13:35.740
as the CBC reported, one woman.

13:35.740 --> 13:40.180
I have to imagine this is something Southern either intended, or something she takes pride

13:40.180 --> 13:41.180
in.

13:41.180 --> 13:45.420
Overall, I got the poorly captured video from her YouTube channel.

13:45.420 --> 13:49.660
This pattern of dreadful on the ground pseudo reporting continued through much of Southern's

13:49.660 --> 13:50.660
early career.

13:50.660 --> 13:55.820
She went to another Slut Walk in Edmonton, a third in Los Angeles, and no valuable reporting

13:55.820 --> 13:56.820
happens.

13:56.820 --> 14:00.380
She tries to capture protesters with poorly thought-out loaded questions, and she goes

14:00.380 --> 14:04.820
the extra mile to make sure we always know how poorly she's being treated.

14:04.820 --> 14:09.800
Our cameraman got shoved and pushed, my sign was ripped up, and I got a few middle fingers

14:09.800 --> 14:11.680
and got called a bitch.

14:11.680 --> 14:16.640
She always underscores how she feels afraid or frightened, and that the people she disagrees

14:16.640 --> 14:21.160
with aren't just people she disagrees with, they're people who are, in some way, rude

14:21.160 --> 14:23.660
or physically dangerous.

14:23.660 --> 14:29.680
In other words, she's undermined their arguments by attacking their supposedly boorish characters.

14:29.680 --> 14:32.680
That said, there is some unintentional comedy here.

14:32.680 --> 14:36.600
This time, they did know who I was and did not want to speak to me because of that, so

14:36.600 --> 14:41.080
they kept saying she's not a real reporter and don't talk to her.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.620
They were right.

14:42.620 --> 14:47.240
Someone who goes to a protest, holds up a sign countering their message, and then asks

14:47.240 --> 14:52.640
them loaded questions on camera to make them look silly isn't a reporter, they're someone

14:52.640 --> 14:57.880
with an agenda, someone who is desperately trying to make their political opponents look

14:57.880 --> 14:59.760
terrible.

14:59.760 --> 15:03.160
Before we move on, I want to provide a little bit of extra context here.

15:03.160 --> 15:08.020
The Slutwalks began in 2011 in Toronto as a response to the comments of Toronto Police

15:08.020 --> 15:10.440
Constable Michael Sanguinetti.

15:10.440 --> 15:14.840
He was addressing the issue of campus rape at a York University safety forum and said,

15:14.840 --> 15:18.320
I've been told I'm not supposed to say this.

15:18.320 --> 15:23.120
However, women should avoid dressing like sluts in order not to be victimized.

15:23.120 --> 15:28.080
The public was justifiably concerned that some officers were blaming the victims of

15:28.080 --> 15:32.920
sexual assault, and to voice their displeasure, the first Slutwalk was held in Toronto on

15:32.920 --> 15:34.920
April 3rd, 2011.

15:34.920 --> 15:39.000
These demonstrations quickly spread across Canada and through the United States.

15:39.000 --> 15:43.480
And there you go, you just learned more in the last 30 seconds about why the Slutwalk

15:43.480 --> 15:48.680
was happening than in a half hour's worth of Southern's pseudo-reporting.

15:48.680 --> 15:52.240
Also I should give a little more credit to the woman in sunglasses because as far as

15:52.240 --> 15:57.120
I know, she was the first one to ever refer to Lauren Souther's work as

15:57.120 --> 15:59.120
your pseudo-reporting here.

15:59.120 --> 16:03.600
When Southern added context to her videos, perhaps portraying the views of protesters

16:03.600 --> 16:08.200
in their oral words rather than trying to trap them with loaded questions, Southern

16:08.200 --> 16:12.080
could have engaged with them honestly rather than trying to shape them into the strawman

16:12.080 --> 16:14.040
she was more comfortable tackling.

16:14.040 --> 16:18.240
By not sharing this information with her audience, Lauren Southern is presenting the protesters

16:18.240 --> 16:23.080
as a bunch of eccentric weirdos who have spontaneously decided we live in a rape culture.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.880
And that's the whole point of why the video was made in the first place.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.880
It's not to report on the event as it happens, but to distort the event to fit a right-wing

16:29.880 --> 16:33.960
narrative through a deceptive omission of facts.

16:33.960 --> 16:37.460
Southern moved away from covering protests in North America and took her grand circus

16:37.460 --> 16:40.240
to Europe for more pseudo-reporting.

16:40.240 --> 16:44.920
This time it was on something she was even less qualified to cover, the role of immigration

16:44.920 --> 16:46.360
in Europe.

16:46.360 --> 16:50.200
Southern's video about a demonstration in London campaigning to remain in the EU is

16:50.200 --> 16:57.320
titled Lauren Southern Attacked by Anti-Fascist Thugs in London.

16:57.320 --> 17:01.440
And to be honest, the title gives away everything that's wrong with this video.

17:01.440 --> 17:06.840
This isn't, as the description claims, Lauren Southern reporting for The Rebel Media.

17:06.840 --> 17:11.480
This is a video about Lauren Southern being attacked by supposed thugs.

17:11.480 --> 17:13.600
The video opens with text.

17:13.600 --> 17:17.840
Not about the demonstration, but about how Southern was in danger at the rally.

17:17.840 --> 17:22.640
The first images we see are of a camera pointed at the ground as the cameraman tries to orient

17:22.640 --> 17:23.640
himself.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.200
The rest of the video is a garbled mess, and it creates the impression that as soon as

17:27.200 --> 17:30.200
Southern showed up, things got messy and violent.

17:30.200 --> 17:33.280
Now this is a real problem if you're a journalist.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.920
How do you cover an event that includes a hostile element?

17:35.920 --> 17:40.240
If you step into an area and get immediately attacked, you might need to rethink your strategy

17:40.240 --> 17:44.520
and maybe find a go-between or maybe you have to reach out to people indirectly to get their

17:44.520 --> 17:46.180
comments and opinions.

17:46.180 --> 17:49.300
But I did leave out an important fact there.

17:49.300 --> 17:52.700
Southern's crew didn't get attacked as soon as they entered the park.

17:52.700 --> 17:57.260
I know this for a fact because a few days later, The Rebel Media uploaded a video titled

17:57.260 --> 17:59.620
Full Length Version.

17:59.620 --> 18:04.660
Lower and Southern attacked by anti-fascists at London Brexit Rally.

18:04.660 --> 18:09.380
There are two problems with this title, aside from the fact that it's schlocky clickbait.

18:09.380 --> 18:12.940
It isn't the full length version of events because it's missing about a minute that

18:12.940 --> 18:14.740
was included in the first video.

18:14.740 --> 18:20.140
Also, it's not a Brexit rally, it was a rally against the Brexit movement.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.180
A small detail, but a sloppy mistake nonetheless.

18:23.180 --> 18:27.500
What's far more interesting is how this video opens where we hear Southern describing

18:27.500 --> 18:29.700
her strategy for covering this rally.

18:29.700 --> 18:33.380
I literally don't even have to interview anyone, I can just stand here and it exposes

18:33.380 --> 18:34.940
what this group is like.

18:34.940 --> 18:38.620
That's a damning thing for a journalist to say.

18:38.620 --> 18:43.100
And more damning, Southern freely admits to not having interviewed a person the whole

18:43.100 --> 18:44.700
time she was there.

18:44.700 --> 18:51.300
Of course, she doesn't literally mean she hasn't talked to anyone because there's

18:51.300 --> 18:56.820
some footage of her talking to a guy who went up and took her hat and threw it in the garbage.

18:56.820 --> 19:00.940
He shouldn't have done that, but it's a far cry from the impression the first video

19:00.940 --> 19:05.500
gives you of Southern being attacked by anti-fascist thugs.

19:05.500 --> 19:09.180
As best I can tell from the second video, Southern's strategy on covering this rally

19:09.180 --> 19:13.260
was to stand around in a silly hat and make commentary about people while a cameraman

19:13.260 --> 19:14.420
filmed them.

19:14.420 --> 19:19.020
How can a supposed journalist justify describing the opinions and views of people around her

19:19.020 --> 19:21.180
without taking a moment to speak to them?

19:21.180 --> 19:25.180
Even if all she has are her loaded questions, that's better than not talking to someone

19:25.180 --> 19:27.180
who's only a few meters away from you.

19:27.180 --> 19:31.060
Aside from the clown who stole her hat and a few heated confrontations, it's difficult

19:31.060 --> 19:34.860
to see just how viciously Southern and her crew were actually attacked.

19:34.860 --> 19:39.340
And speaking genuinely, it's a shame that some demonstrators weren't on their best

19:39.340 --> 19:40.540
behavior.

19:40.540 --> 19:44.780
But this doesn't for a second let us Southern, who's reporting amounted to her standing

19:44.780 --> 19:48.740
around making fun of people and then acting surprised when people got upset.

19:48.740 --> 19:53.300
While the first video got nearly 2 million views, this longer version struggled to get

19:53.300 --> 19:55.340
even 70,000.

19:55.340 --> 19:59.660
The rebel media put out the edited one for a reason, and the headline gives it away.

19:59.660 --> 20:03.060
This was an honest reporting about the anti-Brexit protesters.

20:03.060 --> 20:07.220
This was done purely to frame them as dangerous and violent.

20:07.220 --> 20:11.580
The con of placing Lauren Southern in supposed danger is a pattern you'll see in many of

20:11.580 --> 20:12.580
her videos.

20:12.580 --> 20:15.980
There's always something that comes up in a video that scares her.

20:15.980 --> 20:20.620
As another example, in her video, Why Lauren Southern Needed Security to Walk Through Mowland

20:20.620 --> 20:25.540
Beak, Belgium, she begins to panic when her film crew gets stares while they wander around

20:25.540 --> 20:27.060
at 11pm.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.900
The idea that a woman with a camera crew, speaking English, wandering around the street

20:30.900 --> 20:36.820
in the middle of the night, catching a few glances, doesn't seem particularly strange

20:36.820 --> 20:49.060
to me.

20:49.060 --> 20:50.740
Southern is clearly scared here.

20:50.740 --> 20:55.220
It makes me wonder why she just didn't pack it in while there was still daylight.

20:55.220 --> 20:59.220
Filming at night is always harder because you need to lug around heavy lighting equipment,

20:59.220 --> 21:01.140
and there aren't as many people around to speak to.

21:01.140 --> 21:05.820
It's almost as if she was trying to manufacture a situation where it would look like she's

21:05.820 --> 21:06.820
in danger.

21:06.820 --> 21:10.500
Let's listen to what she says when she starts discussing people who don't want their faces

21:10.500 --> 21:11.540
filmed.

21:11.540 --> 21:16.820
This could suggest a number of things, but before you have any reasonable ideas like

21:16.820 --> 21:21.420
maybe people just don't want to appear on camera and they're going about their day,

21:21.420 --> 21:34.220
Southern is ready to speculate with something else, something less generous.

21:34.220 --> 21:39.100
Without a grossly irresponsible bit of commentary, not wanting your face on camera doesn't make

21:39.100 --> 21:40.580
someone a criminal.

21:40.580 --> 22:03.580
Does Southern have any reason to believe there's a crime issue in Mullenbeek?

22:03.580 --> 22:11.860
Listen to what Southern said before she asked the guy the question.

22:11.860 --> 22:16.580
Why did she decide to show this guy instead of the other people she mentions who say there's

22:16.580 --> 22:17.580
no crime?

22:17.580 --> 22:22.860
I'm not sure what gives this shopkeeper special knowledge of the situation, but wouldn't

22:22.860 --> 22:24.740
actual crime statistics help here?

22:24.740 --> 22:28.260
Here's a crazy idea, let's actually look at those.

22:28.260 --> 22:33.140
According to the Brussels Institute for Statistics and Analysis, the total number of criminal

22:33.140 --> 22:40.660
offenses in Mullenbeek actually went up in 2016 from 9,184 to 10,087.

22:40.660 --> 22:45.380
An increase of about 10% isn't really a crime wave, and of course it should be noted that

22:45.380 --> 22:52.380
it went back down in 2017 to 8,818, but this video is from 2016, so I'm not going to criticize

22:52.380 --> 22:53.660
it for not knowing the future.

22:53.660 --> 22:58.420
It's better to look at stats when they have a bit of context to them, so is Mullenbeek

22:58.420 --> 23:03.740
especially dangerous as a neighborhood compared to other locations in Brussels?

23:03.740 --> 23:07.120
A look at the numbers suggests no, definitely not.

23:07.120 --> 23:14.200
With a population of 96,629 and a total number of crimes of 10,087, that works out to one

23:14.200 --> 23:20.220
crime per 9.6 citizens, or as it might be more commonly presented, 1,044 crimes per

23:20.220 --> 23:21.220
10,000 people.

23:21.220 --> 23:26.820
Out of 19 neighborhoods in Brussels, Mullenbeek is ranked 6th as most crimes per capita.

23:26.820 --> 23:31.140
So while it certainly isn't the safest place to be if you're in Brussels, there's no

23:31.140 --> 23:34.460
real evidence to suggest it's especially dangerous.

23:34.460 --> 23:41.340
Or more dangerous than say, downtown Brussels, which saw 40,191 crimes in 2016 working out

23:41.340 --> 23:49.140
to roughly one crime per 4.4 citizens, or 2,277 crimes per 10,000 people.

23:49.140 --> 23:53.940
So Mullenbeek is safer both proportionally and in total crime than walking around the

23:53.940 --> 23:56.540
most populous area in Brussels.

23:56.540 --> 23:59.540
But why did Southern choose Mullenbeek to begin with?

23:59.540 --> 24:04.380
This was part of a popular right-wing narrative at the time that Mullenbeek was a no-go zone

24:04.380 --> 24:05.380
in Brussels.

24:05.380 --> 24:09.300
A small number of residents who had lived in the area had committed terror attacks in

24:09.300 --> 24:14.880
Europe, most notably the 2015 attack in Paris that killed 130 people.

24:14.880 --> 24:20.100
This tragedy was used to demonize an entire neighborhood as the breeding ground for jihadis.

24:20.100 --> 24:23.820
Southern's contribution to this body of journalism was to walk around the neighborhood, talk

24:23.820 --> 24:27.080
to a few people, and then get very scared in the evening.

24:27.080 --> 24:29.540
Did we learn anything in her video?

24:29.540 --> 24:33.380
Did it provide any real context that might inform its audience?

24:33.380 --> 24:37.980
No, we just got another sample of a right-wing narrative designed to portray the Mullenbeek

24:37.980 --> 24:41.820
neighborhood as dangerous without any substantive evidence.

24:41.820 --> 24:46.700
This is part of a larger anti-immigrant narrative, especially in anti-Muslim immigrants, that

24:46.700 --> 24:49.460
runs throughout right-wing media.

24:49.460 --> 24:53.620
You can see even lazier examples of this in Southern's video of her walking around

24:53.620 --> 25:00.820
a German town in 2016, titled Lauren Southern, I Thought I Was in Germany, Turkey, and her

25:00.820 --> 25:08.020
infamous 2017 video, The Streets of Paris, both of which feature no interviews, no substantive

25:08.020 --> 25:14.080
research, and nothing more than someone walking around with a camera gawking at things, completely

25:14.080 --> 25:17.860
devoid of the speculative commentary found in the Germany video.

25:17.860 --> 25:22.420
Southern's Paris video in particular is a shining example of meaningless footage.

25:22.420 --> 25:27.460
Walking through Paris while gawking at the non-white people is not only not journalism,

25:27.460 --> 25:32.500
I am struggling to describe it as anything other than racist.

25:32.500 --> 25:36.500
What precisely is someone supposed to get out of this?

25:36.500 --> 25:41.900
What's suggested in the video is that the face of Paris is changing, and the only real

25:41.900 --> 25:47.140
change that this video demonstrates is that there are a larger number of faces that are

25:47.140 --> 25:49.060
not white.

25:49.060 --> 25:52.960
There is literally nothing else you can get from this video.

25:52.960 --> 25:57.460
The description tries to provide cover by pointing out how no one was speaking French,

25:57.460 --> 26:01.860
but since the audio is a music track, we have to take Southern's word on that, and being

26:01.860 --> 26:03.980
bilingual hardly seems like a threat.

26:03.980 --> 26:08.100
The point she raises about French braids is mystifying.

26:08.100 --> 26:11.260
She could have also mentioned that no one was eating French toast.

26:11.260 --> 26:17.100
Sources such as this one emphasize how uninterested Lauren Southern is in reporting anything.

26:17.100 --> 26:21.820
She may be adopting the on-the-ground style you often see real journalists use, but instead

26:21.820 --> 26:25.860
of reporting anything, she is using it to smuggle right-wing talking points under the

26:25.860 --> 26:27.640
guise of journalism.

26:27.640 --> 26:31.860
The videos are designed to hide facts and distort realities, so you'll buy into the

26:31.860 --> 26:40.580
worldview Southern is pushing.

26:40.580 --> 26:44.300
If you aren't familiar with right-wing talking points and narratives, videos pretending to

26:44.300 --> 26:47.820
be reporting like Lauren Southern's might seem compelling.

26:47.820 --> 26:52.140
Perhaps it may even seem like I'm projecting some right-wing stereotype on a woman who's

26:52.140 --> 26:54.640
honestly trying her best to report the facts.

26:54.640 --> 26:58.460
So to try to push back on that, I'm going to spend a bit of time looking at the ideology

26:58.460 --> 27:03.400
that drives Southern, which she happily illustrates for us in a short book published in 2016.

27:03.400 --> 27:09.260
It has the friendly title of Barbarians, how the baby boomers, immigration, and Islam screwed

27:09.260 --> 27:10.820
my generation.

27:10.820 --> 27:16.260
It's a mere 82 pages long, with one of the biggest fonts and margins I've ever seen

27:16.260 --> 27:17.520
in such a tiny book.

27:17.520 --> 27:21.800
If you got rid of the citations, it would be slightly under 20,000 words.

27:21.800 --> 27:26.700
It's more like a long essay rather than a book, or maybe more accurately, a series of

27:26.700 --> 27:28.800
very short essays.

27:28.800 --> 27:33.900
Much of the book is populated with poorly sourced ideas, personal stories, and misreadings

27:33.900 --> 27:36.420
of history, art, and current affairs.

27:36.420 --> 27:40.560
I couldn't possibly detail everything she gets wrong, so I'll narrow it down to a few

27:40.560 --> 27:43.380
points that describe the narrative in Southern's mind.

27:43.380 --> 27:48.180
Towards the end, Southern offers four recommendations on how to save the West.

27:48.180 --> 27:53.780
And they are building border walls, an immigration policy based on merit and national origin,

27:53.780 --> 27:58.020
protecting free speech, and making people ashamed for needing welfare.

27:58.020 --> 28:02.620
The welfare one has just a really shitty thing to do, but I want to focus in on the national

28:02.620 --> 28:05.140
origin part of the second point.

28:05.140 --> 28:10.700
Although Southern claims not to be a racist, points like this make me pause.

28:10.700 --> 28:13.100
She also writes this.

28:13.100 --> 28:17.660
Immigration policy in the West simply fails to be remotely meritocratic.

28:17.660 --> 28:21.460
Immigrants are not let in to fill niches where our countries need help or to contribute in

28:21.460 --> 28:23.300
some way to society.

28:23.300 --> 28:27.300
It's even considered controversial in some circles to suggest that immigrants should

28:27.300 --> 28:29.420
be able to pull their own weight.

28:29.420 --> 28:31.260
All of this must be reversed.

28:31.260 --> 28:36.120
In the US, a good start would be repealing the Immigration Act of 1965 so that things

28:36.120 --> 28:41.340
like national origin can be factored into our calculus, and so that the limits of immigration

28:41.340 --> 28:44.300
from other Western countries can be removed.

28:44.300 --> 28:48.580
Everywhere else, the same sort of measures must be taken.

28:48.580 --> 28:53.260
The first thing you'll notice is that no sources are cited for any of this.

28:53.260 --> 28:58.940
While Southern does on occasion provide them, I counted 33 sources out of 48 footnotes

28:58.940 --> 28:59.940
provided.

28:59.940 --> 29:04.460
Every look at any Western nation's immigration process will show you the hoops foreign national

29:04.460 --> 29:07.100
has to jump through in order to immigrate.

29:07.100 --> 29:12.540
It often involves interviews, providing documentation for skills, and other requirements that demonstrate

29:12.540 --> 29:13.540
merit.

29:13.540 --> 29:17.180
And Lauren Southern completely contradicts herself when she talks about how national

29:17.180 --> 29:19.900
origin should be factored into the calculation.

29:19.900 --> 29:24.220
She isn't even subtle about when she says limits on Western countries should be removed.

29:24.220 --> 29:29.100
She wants immigrants not coming from Western nations to be subject to greater selection

29:29.100 --> 29:30.140
pressures.

29:30.140 --> 29:34.700
If potential immigrants are being chosen based on their merit, what does their nationality

29:34.700 --> 29:36.220
have to do with that?

29:36.220 --> 29:40.860
If two doctors are applying to immigrate to Canada, one from Norway and the other from

29:40.860 --> 29:45.660
Pakistan, and all things about them otherwise are equal, why would Lauren Southern want

29:45.660 --> 29:47.540
to turn away the doctor from Pakistan?

29:47.540 --> 29:52.420
Or at least, why does that Pakistani doctor have to face restrictions that the Norwegian

29:52.420 --> 29:53.860
one wouldn't?

29:53.860 --> 29:57.740
I won't pretend I'm the first person to notice Lauren Southern saying something about immigration

29:57.740 --> 30:01.300
that, at the very least, sounds a little racist.

30:01.300 --> 30:06.020
For a more comprehensive look at this, check out Sean's excellent video, The Great Replacement

30:06.020 --> 30:08.820
Isn't Real, featuring Lauren Southern.

30:08.820 --> 30:12.540
Another popular theme in Southern's commentary is an appeal to a traditional lifestyle for

30:12.540 --> 30:13.540
women.

30:13.540 --> 30:19.060
That is to say, women should dedicate themselves to raising children in order to be happier.

30:19.060 --> 30:23.620
She often cites science she doesn't understand to produce opinion pieces that, instead of

30:23.620 --> 30:27.860
engaging with scientific evidence, distort it to fit a right-wing narrative.

30:27.860 --> 30:33.100
For a more thorough examination of this, I highly recommend another video by Sean titled,

30:33.100 --> 30:37.060
What Every Girl Needs to Hear, a Response to Lauren Southern.

30:37.060 --> 30:41.060
And after two shoutouts, I hope Sean sends me a nice check for putting him on the map

30:41.060 --> 30:42.060
like this.

30:42.060 --> 30:43.060
You're welcome.

30:43.060 --> 30:46.660
I really only highlight these two ideologies that exist in Lauren Southern's commentary

30:46.660 --> 30:49.460
to draw a connection to her pseudo-reporting.

30:49.460 --> 30:52.700
Everything she does is in service to this right-wing narrative, and how it hearkens

30:52.700 --> 30:57.900
back to a golden age, specifically the 1950s, as best I can narrow it down.

30:57.900 --> 31:02.740
Her book specifically takes aim at Baby Boomers, who squandered the success of, as they're

31:02.740 --> 31:08.340
labeled in the media, The Greatest Generation, that is, the generation that fought the Nazis

31:08.340 --> 31:13.540
in World War II, which, I will admit, was pretty nice of them.

31:13.540 --> 31:18.260
Southern is trying to pull the West back to the time before the Baby Boomers supposedly

31:18.260 --> 31:19.900
ruined everything.

31:19.900 --> 31:24.660
In the interests of charity, I'm not certain the Jim Crow laws, rampant sexism, and rampant

31:24.660 --> 31:30.220
homophobia of the era enter into Lauren Southern's imagination when she says she and her fellow

31:30.220 --> 31:31.220
travelers are,

31:31.220 --> 31:35.980
We're longing for an age we've never lived in, and we're trying to recreate something

31:35.980 --> 31:39.740
that we never grew up being taught or understood.

31:39.740 --> 31:45.740
To be as generous as possible, Lauren Southern may not be a traditionalist hiding her secret

31:45.740 --> 31:51.460
racism and sexism, but in the best-case scenario, she's a traditionalist who doesn't understand

31:51.460 --> 31:57.140
the racism and sexism that were implicit parts of the era she longs to be a part of.

31:57.140 --> 32:01.680
And her ignorance does not excuse the harm inherent in her message.

32:01.680 --> 32:05.860
And that message is important to understand when it's being pushed to you through the

32:05.860 --> 32:08.380
context of pseudo-journalism.

32:08.380 --> 32:09.860
Are you a racist?

32:09.860 --> 32:13.420
No, I'm not a racist, and the alt-right hates me.

32:13.420 --> 32:17.340
They don't have any idea what they're talking about, these are just names that they throw

32:17.340 --> 32:18.340
around.

32:18.340 --> 32:27.340
Quite frankly, when I went to South Africa...

32:27.340 --> 32:31.140
Now that we've taken a look at Lauren Southern's early attempts at journalism and the ideology

32:31.140 --> 32:35.000
that her pseudo-reporting masks, I want to look at some of the more advanced techniques

32:35.000 --> 32:37.140
she's recently employed.

32:37.140 --> 32:43.020
The slickly-produced documentary titled Farmlands uses Southern's tactic of throwing her into

32:43.020 --> 32:47.900
a new environment with little knowledge or research to advance a right-wing narrative.

32:47.900 --> 32:52.020
Perhaps most disturbingly, though, she uses real subjects to advance this narrative and

32:52.020 --> 32:55.100
push for this idea of an impending race war.

32:55.100 --> 32:59.700
A full debunking of this film may be necessary at some point, but in the interest of keeping

32:59.700 --> 33:04.900
this video under an hour, I'm just going to highlight a few specific points.

33:04.900 --> 33:10.140
First off, Southern freely admits that she has no statistical proof for her claims.

33:10.140 --> 33:17.220
About the most gruesome murders imaginable, with almost no statistical proof of their

33:17.220 --> 33:19.020
existence.

33:19.020 --> 33:23.900
By that, she means there are no hard numbers for how many white farmers are being killed.

33:23.900 --> 33:29.580
But a lack of specific data doesn't always mean an absence of data, so she almost cleverly

33:29.580 --> 33:32.360
finds a different source for her information.

33:32.360 --> 33:37.900
She interviews several people from Blood Sisters Crime Scene Cleanup, an outfit that is responsible

33:37.900 --> 33:41.700
for cleaning up various crime scenes across South Africa.

33:41.700 --> 33:46.780
Southern is basing much of her claim on numbers she gets from CSC in this interview.

33:46.780 --> 33:50.300
But they don't really provide any real numbers.

33:50.300 --> 33:54.580
In fact, they will tell you that they don't have a full set of data.

33:54.580 --> 34:02.020
Between 2012 and 2016, the attacks on small holding farms or properties deemed as a farm

34:02.020 --> 34:10.540
or an area non-residential has increased by an average of 72.9 percent.

34:10.540 --> 34:16.820
The figures that I've just given you is, according to our statistics, government statistics will

34:16.820 --> 34:17.820
differ.

34:17.820 --> 34:22.220
I don't suppose you can tell us much about white others.

34:22.220 --> 34:30.780
Well, we don't work closely with them because we don't do every scene, but their figures

34:30.780 --> 34:33.580
are funnily a lot lower than ours.

34:33.580 --> 34:36.560
I don't have a particular reason for that.

34:36.560 --> 34:42.260
What this answer is actually evidence of is not that farm murders are going up, but that

34:42.260 --> 34:46.700
the number of crime scenes CSC has been called into has gone up.

34:46.700 --> 34:51.740
This could mean everything from CSC's market share expanding, or the number of murders

34:51.740 --> 34:53.540
actually going up.

34:53.540 --> 34:57.060
Not an open and shut statistic, it's vague.

34:57.060 --> 35:01.040
If I were to hazard a guess, the reason CSC has been getting more calls is because their

35:01.040 --> 35:03.260
business has been expanding.

35:03.260 --> 35:07.940
They started their business in the mid-2000s and are currently franchising it, so more

35:07.940 --> 35:13.420
people have been operating under the CSC banner and therefore covering more crime scenes.

35:13.420 --> 35:19.300
There's also the success of the book written by the two sisters who founded the CSC, and

35:19.300 --> 35:22.900
its reception in the media might also be leading to a few new jobs.

35:22.900 --> 35:24.740
This stat needs more context.

35:24.740 --> 35:28.500
Instead, Southern says this.

35:28.500 --> 35:35.920
This was the first time on camera a qualified government associate had confirmed my worst

35:35.920 --> 35:37.320
fears.

35:37.320 --> 35:45.020
Not only are the farm murders real, the genuine numbers are much higher than we imagined.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.780
Are they though?

35:46.780 --> 35:50.260
Didn't Southern say there was no data to begin with?

35:51.260 --> 36:00.100
So what are these government numbers that don't

36:00.100 --> 36:01.100
seem accurate?

36:01.100 --> 36:05.540
We're never told as the audience, but don't worry, I'll fill you in on this a little bit

36:05.540 --> 36:06.540
later.

36:06.540 --> 36:10.340
The questions as to why the CSC crews are getting more work are never really asked,

36:10.340 --> 36:14.620
and we're only shown a few pieces that build this race war narrative that the film is advancing.

36:14.620 --> 36:19.300
This is best revealed when the CSC reps are asked about the motivation of the murders.

36:19.300 --> 36:24.140
How on earth can you expect them to be able to credibly answer that question?

36:24.140 --> 36:28.580
These people aren't law enforcement investigating the murders, they are literally just people

36:28.580 --> 36:30.780
who wipe the blood off the floor.

36:30.780 --> 36:42.940
90% of the increase we found is due to unemployment, racial discrimination, and there's no hope.

36:42.940 --> 36:46.740
If you don't start your own business in South Africa, where are you going to work?

36:46.740 --> 36:48.460
There's no work.

36:48.460 --> 36:52.740
Racial discrimination against who, if you don't mind me asking?

36:52.740 --> 36:54.940
Yeah, I have to be careful.

36:54.940 --> 36:55.940
Careful?

36:55.940 --> 36:58.940
Yeah, well, I have to be a little bit careful.

36:58.940 --> 37:06.300
We work very closely with government, and I spoke to Simon about it outside.

37:06.300 --> 37:11.020
Racial discrimination against people.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.300
What's suggested here, of course, is that they don't want to risk their government

37:14.300 --> 37:18.460
contract by saying racial discrimination against white people is the cause for the

37:18.460 --> 37:20.780
supposed increase in murders.

37:20.780 --> 37:25.140
This right here is a perfect example of how the film provides just enough evidence to

37:25.140 --> 37:27.140
let the audience fill in the gap.

37:27.140 --> 37:31.100
But was there more evidence here that could have been provided to give a little more context

37:31.100 --> 37:32.460
to the segment?

37:32.460 --> 37:36.980
Something that maybe would have contradicted the narrative Southern and her crew are trying

37:36.980 --> 37:38.300
to push?

37:38.300 --> 37:42.060
During this interview we see some B-roll of Lauren Southern researching the farm murders

37:42.060 --> 37:43.060
claim.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.020
Hey, I know that website!

37:45.020 --> 37:49.320
Southern claims she found evidence that these murders were racially based from the far corners

37:49.320 --> 37:50.320
of the internet.

37:50.320 --> 37:54.260
And by this far corner, I think she means the third result to pop up when you type in

37:54.260 --> 37:57.060
South African farm murders into Google.

37:57.060 --> 38:01.620
AfricaCheck.org is a website dedicated to thoroughly examining issues in Africa, and

38:01.620 --> 38:06.580
as best I can tell, does a good job of looking at the issue of farm murders, explaining what

38:06.580 --> 38:08.980
is and is not known about them.

38:08.980 --> 38:13.860
The page Southern was looking at is an article titled, Fact Sheet, Statistics on Farm Attacks

38:13.860 --> 38:17.960
and Murders in Essay, obviously being South Africa.

38:17.960 --> 38:23.940
So does this website suggest that murders on farms in South Africa are based on race?

38:23.940 --> 38:27.580
Southern should have scrolled all the way to the bottom of the page because, under the

38:27.580 --> 38:32.740
section titled, Is There a Political Agenda Behind These Attacks?, you can see a breakdown

38:32.740 --> 38:38.940
of the motivations of farm attacks as of 2001, where 52 attacks, or 2% of the total, were

38:38.940 --> 38:40.780
motivated by race.

38:40.780 --> 38:45.900
And keep in mind, these numbers only reflect attacks and not murders.

38:45.900 --> 38:50.740
These are the only numbers on this page that discuss race as a motivating factor, and may

38:50.740 --> 38:56.300
not even be reliable according to the 2003 National Operating Coordinating Committee.

38:56.300 --> 38:57.300
Who are they?

38:57.300 --> 39:01.060
They're the group responsible for this little bit of text here that was underneath the graph

39:01.060 --> 39:04.620
that Southern was supposedly reading.

39:04.620 --> 39:09.020
The 2003 Committee of Inquiry into Farm Attacks included that none of the statistics collected

39:09.020 --> 39:14.240
between 1991 to 2001 were completely accurate and should be viewed and interpreted with

39:14.240 --> 39:15.860
caution.

39:15.860 --> 39:20.780
Looking through the AfricaCheck.org website, I couldn't find a single article that suggested

39:20.780 --> 39:23.300
that these crimes were motivated by race.

39:23.300 --> 39:25.500
Maybe Southern was looking somewhere else.

39:25.500 --> 39:28.140
I'd be curious to know where.

39:28.140 --> 39:33.260
And of course, journalists always cite their sources, which is exactly why the description

39:33.260 --> 39:36.540
box has none.

39:36.540 --> 39:38.540
But the murders are surely real, right?

39:38.540 --> 39:40.900
The website can at least confirm that.

39:40.900 --> 39:45.260
The stats on the page, which are the official government stats on murder I mentioned, were

39:45.260 --> 39:47.740
right there for Lauren Southern to check the whole time.

39:47.740 --> 39:50.980
If only she had scrolled a little bit further.

39:50.980 --> 39:54.760
The stats on the page Southern was looking at show murder rates are rather flat for farmers

39:54.760 --> 39:59.280
in South Africa, or according to police data, might be going down slightly.

39:59.280 --> 40:03.920
But more importantly, AfricaCheck describes the data is impossible to calculate, not just

40:03.920 --> 40:08.680
because murders may not be adequately reported, but because of how difficult it is to calculate

40:08.680 --> 40:11.160
the number in farmers in South Africa.

40:11.160 --> 40:15.520
Maybe this is what Southern meant when she said there weren't any real stats to consult.

40:15.520 --> 40:19.220
So where did she get the idea that there was a problem in the first place?

40:19.220 --> 40:22.680
It might have been useful to ask someone at crime scene cleaners how many murder scenes

40:22.680 --> 40:25.760
they clean up in the air, and not just how much it's gone up by.

40:25.760 --> 40:29.280
If the numbers were higher than what was reported by the police, you'd have some

40:29.280 --> 40:33.280
actual evidence for your claim that the government is lying about the number of murders.

40:33.280 --> 40:34.880
Imagine if someone did that, though.

40:34.880 --> 40:39.080
If someone actually did some real journalism to check the claim out and see how many sites

40:39.080 --> 40:42.280
CSC covered in a year that were murders, that'd be pretty good, right?

40:42.280 --> 40:44.040
That'd be great journalism.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.040
So I did it.

40:45.040 --> 40:49.680
According to a portfolio published by CSC, on average, they clean up 33 murder sites

40:49.680 --> 40:50.920
a year.

40:50.920 --> 40:55.760
That's presumably all murders, since they don't specifically state farm murders.

40:55.760 --> 41:00.280
The most recent number for annual farm deaths, according to the police of South Africa, is

41:00.280 --> 41:01.280
74.

41:01.280 --> 41:05.520
So the government's numbers are actually over twice as high.

41:05.520 --> 41:07.360
So what did that guy say again?

41:07.360 --> 41:14.800
Between 2012 and 2016, the attacks on small holding farms or properties deemed as a farm

41:14.800 --> 41:23.680
or an area non-residential has increased by an average of 72.9%.

41:23.680 --> 41:25.440
He's not even talking about murders here.

41:25.440 --> 41:27.160
He's talking about violent attacks.

41:27.160 --> 41:33.480
So why does Lauren Southern say, not only are the farm murders real, the genuine numbers

41:33.480 --> 41:36.040
are much higher than we imagined.

41:36.040 --> 41:40.600
It's because she's trying to twist what he says into her narrative of farmer murder

41:40.600 --> 41:42.200
rates going up.

41:42.200 --> 41:47.080
In other words, she's distorting data to push forward this idea of an impending race

41:47.080 --> 41:48.080
war.

41:48.080 --> 41:52.640
A huge portion of this film is dedicated to interviewing people in dire living conditions

41:52.640 --> 41:55.720
or people who have lost loved ones in violent crimes.

41:55.720 --> 42:00.720
These are powerful stories and my heart goes out to people who have to live in really terrible

42:00.720 --> 42:01.720
conditions.

42:01.720 --> 42:06.240
These anecdotes are meant to suggest the overall message of the film that white people are

42:06.240 --> 42:08.600
being wiped out across South Africa.

42:08.600 --> 42:13.420
The stories in this film are presented in a way to push that idea forward and certain

42:13.420 --> 42:17.560
details that may contradict that narrative are conveniently left out.

42:17.560 --> 42:21.920
When a film's thesis is clearly about a supposed race war and then it just drops an interview

42:21.920 --> 42:26.240
where a family member is crying their eyes out over the murder of a loved one, the audience

42:26.240 --> 42:30.720
is left to assume that this is another piece of evidence that a race war is on its way.

42:30.720 --> 42:31.720
Here's an example.

42:31.720 --> 42:37.160
Janine Eichenfelt is interviewed about the murder of her father, Schlock Featherstone.

42:37.160 --> 42:42.560
She recounts the gruesome details and understandably becomes emotional having to tell her story.

42:42.560 --> 42:46.440
Her pain is important to acknowledge as a reminder of how a murder impacts not just

42:46.440 --> 42:48.600
the victim but everyone around them.

42:48.600 --> 42:53.520
And as a quick preface to everything I'm about to say, I genuinely feel awful for her

42:53.520 --> 42:55.480
and she has my deepest sympathies.

42:55.480 --> 43:00.800
I see no reason to think that she was in any way responsible for what Lauren Southern did

43:00.800 --> 43:02.160
with this interview.

43:02.160 --> 43:07.760
She is deserving of our sympathy rather than our scorn as someone who has lost someone

43:07.760 --> 43:13.880
in such a horrible way and then had that loss exploited by a duplicitous filmmaker.

43:13.880 --> 43:18.520
The murder of Featherstone actually fits the alleged purpose of this documentary looking

43:18.520 --> 43:22.240
at various farm murders that happened across South Africa.

43:22.240 --> 43:27.000
But does it fit Southern's narrative of black South Africans attacking white South African

43:27.000 --> 43:31.900
farm owners in an attempt to right a perceived political injustice?

43:31.900 --> 43:35.620
The actual facts surrounding this murder are not difficult to find online.

43:35.620 --> 43:40.740
A quick google of the murderer's name, Winston Boyson, gives you the result of an appeal

43:40.740 --> 43:45.540
that was made earlier this year and that appeal quite helpfully includes some of the details

43:45.540 --> 43:46.620
of the murder.

43:46.620 --> 43:51.700
The first important fact not mentioned in the film is that Boyson killed two people.

43:51.700 --> 43:55.420
The first victim, Brenda Finnis, was Boyson's girlfriend at the time.

43:55.420 --> 43:59.220
A violent interaction between the two left her dead of a stab wound.

43:59.220 --> 44:03.700
The police were on the scene and attempted to arrest Boyson, but he managed to escape.

44:03.700 --> 44:07.660
He spent several days on the run and made his way to Featherstone's farm, where Boyson

44:07.660 --> 44:09.460
had worked in 2014.

44:09.460 --> 44:13.420
Boyson went there in an unsuccessful effort to convince one of his former colleagues to

44:13.420 --> 44:15.260
help him evade the police.

44:15.260 --> 44:20.180
Featherstone was unaware of his presence, but before he departed the farm, Boyson entered

44:20.180 --> 44:22.100
the house to steal a firearm.

44:22.100 --> 44:26.420
When he tried to leave, he was discovered by Featherstone, and in response, Boyson

44:26.420 --> 44:27.420
shot him.

44:27.420 --> 44:31.180
Featherstone attempted to make his way to a phone to call for help, and as he was doing

44:31.180 --> 44:35.340
that, Boyson shot him several more times, murdering him.

44:35.340 --> 44:39.020
Afterwards, Boyson stole some food and Featherstone's vehicle.

44:39.020 --> 44:43.300
He was later apprehended in the bush after fleeing from the vehicle when he saw some

44:43.300 --> 44:46.340
lights that he assumed were law enforcement.

44:46.340 --> 44:48.580
Those are the events according to the court document.

44:48.580 --> 44:53.820
Now I have to ask, does this sound as though Featherstone's death was the product of

44:53.820 --> 44:55.100
racial hatred?

44:55.100 --> 44:58.860
Does it sound like race had anything at all to do with the murder?

44:58.860 --> 45:02.980
Or perhaps this story was as simple as a man on the run from the law who murdered an innocent

45:02.980 --> 45:04.180
bystander.

45:04.180 --> 45:08.460
In what way does this event back up Southern's claim that white farmers are being attacked

45:08.460 --> 45:11.700
by the black majority in South Africa for their land?

45:11.700 --> 45:16.100
These details, which took seconds to find online, are omitted from the film.

45:16.100 --> 45:19.340
Even the claim that Boyson got 15 years in prison is false.

45:19.340 --> 45:23.580
He was sentenced to 15 years for the murder of Finis, a lifetime in prison for the murder

45:23.580 --> 45:27.980
of Featherstone, and another 15 years for the theft, so the point about the government

45:27.980 --> 45:34.540
trying to protect the murderer, as subtly suggested by the film, is also not true.

45:34.540 --> 45:39.820
Of course, this appeal happened in February of 2018, and farmlands debuted in August

45:39.820 --> 45:41.380
of 2018.

45:41.380 --> 45:46.380
And it should be noted that this interview was certainly done before February of 2018.

45:46.380 --> 45:49.820
It's possible Lauren Southern was too far in production to update the story with additional

45:49.820 --> 45:51.460
narration or captioning.

45:51.460 --> 45:55.300
But I don't personally believe this, as an update would have undercut the whole point

45:55.300 --> 45:58.540
of the film and why this interview exists within it.

45:58.540 --> 46:02.700
I also believe Southern was at least partially aware of the facts surrounding this case,

46:02.700 --> 46:04.500
and she purposely chose to omit them.

46:04.500 --> 46:08.100
Here's some additional context that was given to this interview when Southern originally

46:08.100 --> 46:12.820
published it to her YouTube channel as a teaser for the documentary in January of 2018.

46:13.540 --> 46:18.900
Janine and other families like hers have told me they are not convinced these brutal attacks

46:18.900 --> 46:25.560
are just random acts, but that the South African government may very well be complicit in allowing

46:25.560 --> 46:31.580
them to happen as they continue their political agenda to drive out white farmers and take

46:31.580 --> 46:32.580
their land.

46:32.580 --> 46:37.180
There is no evidence in the interview or any of the facts surrounding the case that this

46:37.180 --> 46:39.940
murder had anything to do with government rhetoric.

46:39.940 --> 46:43.260
So on what basis was she advancing this talking point?

46:43.260 --> 46:47.980
What evidence did she have that this murder was motivated by racial tensions?

46:47.980 --> 46:52.340
Southern removed this bit of commentary from the actual film, but the subtext remains and

46:52.340 --> 46:55.880
it makes it a more subtle and deceptive film.

46:55.880 --> 47:00.880
The message is the same, that the South African government is motivating its citizens with

47:00.880 --> 47:03.740
its rhetoric to murder white farmers.

47:03.740 --> 47:08.340
And there is evidence to suggest that Southern knew more details about this particular murder

47:08.340 --> 47:09.780
than she might let on.

47:09.780 --> 47:14.980
The original clip lets slip into crucial detail when the second victim, Brenda Finnis, is

47:14.980 --> 47:21.980
mentioned in passing.

47:21.980 --> 47:25.400
Why is this the only mention of a second murder victim?

47:25.400 --> 47:30.340
It makes perfect sense for Eilhem Felt to want to focus on her father, but even she

47:30.340 --> 47:31.780
mentioned the second victim.

47:31.780 --> 47:36.740
I simply don't have enough charity in me to assume that Southern was such a poor interviewer

47:36.740 --> 47:40.140
that she had no follow-up questions about a second murder.

47:40.140 --> 47:43.860
What seems far more likely here is that she omitted the details so she could lie about

47:43.860 --> 47:45.940
the reason Featherstone was murdered.

47:45.940 --> 47:50.940
She used an innocent man's death to advance a racist narrative.

47:50.940 --> 47:55.300
After the victim exploitation, Southern goes as far as saying that segregation might be

47:55.300 --> 47:58.020
the only way to prevent a race war.

47:58.020 --> 48:04.060
On and off camera, many people, both black and white, did suggest segregation as a potential

48:04.060 --> 48:06.580
solution to this crisis.

48:06.580 --> 48:13.180
And even more worrying is the growing number of people preparing for a race-based civil

48:13.180 --> 48:17.300
war if another solution cannot be found.

48:17.300 --> 48:22.500
And interviews members of Sweetlanders, a group that is preparing for just that thing.

48:22.500 --> 48:26.840
And it's here where the race war narrative I kept mentioning really comes together.

48:26.840 --> 48:30.540
And obviously, it's not something you would open the film up with.

48:30.540 --> 48:38.380
It's something you have to slowly guide someone to by presenting bad stats and personal stories,

48:38.380 --> 48:42.500
anecdotes that are horribly manipulated and misrepresented to advance this narrative.

48:42.500 --> 48:47.380
So when you're finally here, at the end, where the race war thing comes up, you're

48:47.380 --> 48:50.900
ready to believe it because you've been primed to believe it.

48:50.900 --> 48:56.580
This bit of information is the poison pill this whole film was designed to pass to you.

48:56.580 --> 49:01.820
One gets a strange response from Simon Roche where he gives vague rationalizations as to

49:01.820 --> 49:03.680
why the race war is coming.

49:03.680 --> 49:07.260
This is almost certainly covering for the real reason that the Sweetlanders' preparations

49:07.260 --> 49:11.900
are based on prophecies from a guy's name, Steiner von Rensberg.

49:11.900 --> 49:15.140
Another fact that conveniently gets left out of the film.

49:15.140 --> 49:19.380
Instead of another digression about the many right-wing conspiracies that surround South

49:19.380 --> 49:24.620
Africa, I highly recommend this excellent video, South Africa and the Far Right, part

49:24.620 --> 49:26.380
one by Rational Disconnect.

49:26.380 --> 49:29.820
He goes into the history of this race war narrative and how it's used by the Far Right

49:29.820 --> 49:34.780
to advance a specific narrative that white people and black people can't get along.

49:34.780 --> 49:39.780
He also debunks Lawrence Southern's film in about a minute, which makes me feel like

49:39.780 --> 49:43.540
I'm being really inefficient here.

49:43.540 --> 49:45.540
This is not reporting.

49:45.540 --> 49:49.820
This is a careful distortion of facts used to advance a false dichotomy.

49:49.820 --> 49:54.500
This film is utterly convinced that the black and white populations of South Africa simply

49:54.500 --> 50:01.220
can't live together, and the reason for that lies with the anger of the black population.

50:01.220 --> 50:04.340
In one of her most recent videos, Lawrence Southern declared that she would be leaving

50:04.340 --> 50:09.700
the world of YouTube to focus on making larger documentary films, like Farmlands.

50:09.700 --> 50:13.780
We can expect a highly polished production that's deeply deceptive and advances a hateful

50:13.780 --> 50:18.340
narrative, one that exploits real victims and suffering and coops it to fit her narrative

50:18.340 --> 50:21.380
of white people under attack by the non-white world.

50:21.380 --> 50:24.580
These documentaries are not factual or honest.

50:24.580 --> 50:30.380
Much like her earlier reporting, they are advancing a particular right-wing narrative.

50:30.380 --> 50:33.940
After I finished recording and editing most of this video, Lawrence Southern announced

50:33.940 --> 50:38.140
her newest documentary film project, Borderless.

50:38.140 --> 50:42.620
And it more or less matches up exactly with what I thought it would be, specifically that

50:42.620 --> 50:47.700
narrative of white people under attack by the non-white world.

50:47.700 --> 50:51.780
Borderless once again sends her to Europe, where she'll probably conflate immigrants

50:51.780 --> 50:56.580
and refugees, include scenes where she feels like she's in danger, and feature heavily

50:56.580 --> 51:03.700
edited interviews that are anecdotes designed to make immigrants appear like evil threats.

51:03.700 --> 51:08.180
Things she probably won't touch on are stats that show the positive impact of immigrants,

51:08.180 --> 51:14.260
socially and economically, how European anti-immigrant sentiment often includes white immigrants,

51:14.260 --> 51:20.740
and that Europe is not a homogenous culture that she so cheerfully describes as the West.

51:20.740 --> 51:25.220
After she passes around the donation hat and lovers of pro-white people documentaries throw

51:25.220 --> 51:30.100
in their money, she could produce something of value that critically engages with the

51:30.100 --> 51:31.100
subject.

51:31.100 --> 51:35.020
That would even be nice to see, I mean, I like surprises.

51:35.020 --> 51:36.900
But I'm not holding my breath here.
