1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
April 24th while hosting one of the highest rated programs on the channel, Tucker Carlson,

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,920
Left Fox News. There was much celebration in left-wing spaces as one of the leading voices

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:14,240
for far-right messaging was no longer going to have a platform on the most watched cable news

4
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,960
channel in the United States. But even in that moment, people did wonder aloud just

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:23,280
who might be replacing Carlson in that coveted 8pm time slot.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,080
After several weeks of rotating hosts, we got that answer on June 26th.

7
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,960
Jesse Waters would replace Tucker Carlson with his show, Jesse Waters Primetime,

8
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
moving to 8pm on July 17th. If you're not familiar with this guy, Jesse Waters has

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,600
been working for Fox News for his entire professional life. He started off as a

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,040
production assistant at Fox News after graduating from Trinity College with a BA in History in 2001.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,040
In 2003, he was brought on to the O'Reilly Factor, which would go on to be one of the

12
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,320
top-rated shows for Fox. Waters would specialize in unexpectedly confronting interview subjects

13
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,480
in public, often creating footage that was more spectacle than informative.

14
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,480
This is the environment that shaped Waters throughout most of his professional life at

15
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,920
Fox News as he spent roughly 10 years working with O'Reilly.

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
In 2014, Waters joined the Fox News Show Outnumbered, though it was in 2015 where

17
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,920
he really got to spread his wings as the star of Waters World, a monthly special and running

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,640
segment on the O'Reilly Factor. In 2016, one segment garnered quite a bit of attention for

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,600
ostensibly being about asking Chinese Americans in New York their opinions on politics,

20
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,200
all while asking culturally insensitive questions and engaging in East Asian stereotypes.

21
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,000
There was a lot of criticism that was directed towards Waters for this segment,

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,960
though it didn't seem to affect his work in Fox News. This segment wasn't really that unique

23
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,080
either. He would similarly have other segments asking cab drivers about immigration and mocking

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,360
people at pride parades. The anatomy of these segments is pretty basic. Waters would go up to

25
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,840
random people, ask them questions, and play whatever answers they get to make people look

26
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:10,000
stupid, often splicing in footage of random TV shows and movies. It's a very old, tired technique.

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,960
You can see variations of this technique used all over TV and YouTube. It doesn't have much value

28
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,560
as a piece of journalism, but it does give an audience the opportunity to laugh at people

29
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,280
they would dislike, immigrants, people in the LGBT community, and liberals and leftists more

30
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,560
broadly. Waters' world would go from a segment and monthly special to a regular weekly series

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:34,400
in 2017. It would come to an end in January of 2022, but that's just because Jesse Waters was

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,920
getting a new show. Waters' largest platform more recently was his role co-hosting The Five,

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:44,960
which would eventually become Fox News' top show. Waters became one of the show's regular hosts,

34
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,760
starting in 2017. And while the makeup of The Five has changed over the years, right now it

35
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,960
consists of Waters, Greg Gutfeld, Dana Perino, Janine Pirro, Harold Ford Jr., and Jessica Tarloff.

36
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:01,840
Waters again courted controversy on the show for a number of remarks. Some of his more memorable

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,600
ones include when he said Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn't ripe enough to become

38
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:13,520
president. She's not ripe enough to run for president. First, she has to get married.

39
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,120
She has to plan a wedding. You want to plan a wedding and run for president at the same time?

40
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,240
And he said that teachers are taking away gender from kids.

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,720
Little kids are losing their gender because they get stuffed in classrooms with grooming teachers.

42
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,400
He also made this weird comment about how he can tell someone's immigration status

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,480
just by looking at them. I saw on the way into work a illegal immigration family digging through

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,240
the trash, looking for recyclables. How did you know they were illegal? You can tell. Jesse.

45
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,760
I can tell. I'm a city guy. And you don't want me to get into it, but I can tell.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,600
Jesse's commentary on The Five and his commentary more broadly tends to follow this type of pattern,

47
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:59,200
using provocative commentary that seems designed or to shock or entertain depending on the audience.

48
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,560
It usually doesn't have much of the way of serious analysis. On The Five, his voice is balanced out

49
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,920
by the other hosts, but on his own program, Jesse Waters Primetime, we can see how Waters stands on

50
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,240
his own while under the biggest spotlight he's ever had. I should also mention that even though

51
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,360
he has a Primetime show, he is still also one of the hosts on The Five, so he's on two shows every

52
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,920
weekday for Fox News. He's a pretty big deal over there. To see how Jesse Waters has been getting

53
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:28,400
along, I watched the first two weeks of his show from its debut on July 17th, though I'm going to

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,120
mostly focus on that first week as it's fairly representative of his work. I also watched a handful

55
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,920
of episodes for the past year and it's all pretty consistent in quality. And yes, this show has been

56
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,920
on for over a year. In fact, it began airing on January 24th, 2022 as a replacement for the

57
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,880
aforementioned Waters world. So what we're getting isn't a whole new show, but rather a time slot

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
shift. Keep that in mind, as this shouldn't be seen as a show still trying to figure itself out

59
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,840
in its early days, but rather an established entity trying to fill the big hole left by the

60
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,960
departure of Tucker Carlson. Waters' show is structured like most other cable news shows,

61
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,600
a feature story that takes up the first 15 to 20 minutes, usually including a short interview.

62
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,000
The next segment will run a bit shorter, maybe five to ten minutes, and also typically has an

63
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
interview. And then there are a barrage of quick stories and segments, often not lasting more than

64
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,560
a minute or two. It's amazing how many segments they squeeze into this 40-minute program,

65
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,720
usually getting six or seven in each episode. And that's not counting the puff segments where

66
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,680
Waters reads text messages he gets through the program or goes on short rants about his dentist.

67
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:42,080
For the sake of organizing the flurry of stories and segments from just one week of the program,

68
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:47,360
I'm going to organize them into three categories. Real daily news, that is the news of the day that

69
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,880
is timely and relevant to the broader public, boilerplate issue news, stories that individually

70
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,600
don't mean much on their own but serve as evidence of a larger persistent issue in the news,

71
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,360
and non-news stories that have the appearance of news but are actually not reporting or commenting

72
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,120
on anything of value. I also have a bonus category for stuff that was just weird and silly. These are

73
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,400
segments I wanted to talk about but could find a place for. One of the big problems facing cable

74
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,240
news is its struggle to find enough news to fill a 24-hour schedule. That isn't to say there aren't

75
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,040
things happening in the world that are newsworthy. There are plenty of stories to fill up 24 hours.

76
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:30,640
The real challenge comes in finding stories that appeal to a wide audience. As I write this, there

77
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,880
is a coup happening in Niger where there is an attempt to overthrow a democratically elected

78
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,000
government. I don't expect the story to get more than a few mentions on Fox News at best,

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,360
and I would be absolutely shocked it was mentioned at all in Jesse Waters' primetime. In fact,

80
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,400
in the two weeks I spent watching this program, it wasn't mentioned once. On the other hand,

81
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,720
there was typically at least one story every night about Hunter Biden. This isn't just a Fox News

82
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,520
problem though. MSNBC and CNN have this same tendency to focus on stories that appeal to

83
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,920
their audiences more so than any broader principle of news of the day. After all,

84
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:11,440
these channels are designed to earn advertising revenue. And generally speaking, people are less

85
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,000
interested in a government being overthrown in Niger than they are about cocaine being found in

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,720
the White House. Which brings us to one of the few real news stories of the day that Waters covered

87
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,960
on his program. Cocaine was found in the White House. On July 13th, the Secret Service announced

88
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,120
it was closing the investigation into the small bag of cocaine found at the White House due to a

89
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:36,000
lack of physical evidence. This was after it was sent for testing and no fingerprints or DNA could

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,040
be recovered from it. That isn't to say the bag was untouched, rather it could easily mean there

91
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:46,640
wasn't enough uncompromised traces to provide a useful piece of evidence. On his July 18th episode,

92
00:07:46,720 --> 00:08:04,720
Waters covered the story like this. We're already off to a bad start here,

93
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,080
as this interview he's highlighting isn't actually new. It's from Friday, July 14th,

94
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:15,520
four days before Waters' program aired on Tuesday. I guess this supposedly new development

95
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,080
wasn't urgent enough for him to include it in his Monday show, or maybe because it was from that

96
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,960
obscure network known as Fox Business that perhaps he's not familiar with. It's actually standard

97
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,840
police procedure to destroy drugs that aren't part of an active investigation or criminal trial.

98
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:34,560
If no one has been charged and the police have no evidence for an investigation, holding onto drugs

99
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:39,040
takes up valuable space in an evidence locker. I'm sure they have records of the evidence,

100
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,440
whether it be the test results or photographs or other things they can keep for longer storage,

101
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,240
but they simply can't hold onto every piece of drugs they find. But what's more interesting

102
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,880
here is how Waters frames this story and the only supposed path to truth now. The only way now we'll

103
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,080
ever prove whose coke it was is if Hunter confesses. The only way to find out the truth is if Hunter

104
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,440
Pieden confesses. This presupposes Hunter is the one who the drugs belong to. Waters supports this

105
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,440
claim by saying that visitor security is so tight at the White House, only a Biden family member

106
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:22,640
could have brought it in. Over 500 people work full time at the White House, which Waters does

107
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:27,040
mention later but not in the clip I just showed you because it's more important that he craft this

108
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,600
narrative first before mentioning facts that are less convenient. It's easier to ignore something

109
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,560
when a person already has the conclusion fed into their mind. Waters always places an emphasis on

110
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,080
the facts that fuel the speculation he wants his audience to engage in that this cocaine could only

111
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,880
have belonged to Hunter Biden. With 500 people working at the White House, it's quite possible

112
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,360
any one of them could have brought cocaine in there and 500 people with probably very busy,

113
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:56,320
intense jobs and likely coming from privileged households themselves, it's quite possible any

114
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,880
one of them could have been doing cocaine. Did the Secret Service dust the cubby for prints

115
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:07,120
or did they blow up the cubby also? And if you stash coke in the cubby, wouldn't you want to

116
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:14,560
cover it with something like put it in a backpack, put it in a book, maybe a pouch? Was there anything

117
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:20,160
else inside the cubby? I hate to turn this into a basic class on journalism, but asking open-ended

118
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,240
questions isn't journalism. It isn't even analysis. It's the classic conspiracy theory technique of

119
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,200
just asking questions. And with the questions Waters is asking, he's already given away the

120
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,960
game. These questions are designed to create a narrative in the mind of the viewers. Waters isn't

121
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,400
going to answer them because he simply doesn't have the evidence to back them up, but none of

122
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,400
the viewers at home are burdened with that responsibility. And if they need any nudges in

123
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,480
that direction, Waters will make the relevant assumptions and make sure the questions lead

124
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,440
toward a very specific conclusion. That is, only Hunter Biden could have left the cocaine in the

125
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,240
White House. On July 19th, Jesse Waters had an update for a request his team made for footage

126
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,040
from the White House about that cocaine in a locker. Last week, we asked for any and all

127
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,360
surveillance footage relating to the coke bag found at the White House. But the Secret Service

128
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,360
is telling us, no, they're not releasing any tapes or documents. They're telling us releasing it

129
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,320
would interfere with the investigation. But the Secret Service shut down the investigation

130
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,800
last week. This isn't news. This is nothing. Saying you tried to get some evidence, but then

131
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,880
didn't, is not a new development in the story. The subtext is that something fishy is supposedly

132
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,840
happening here, of course without actually doing the very hard work of demonstrating or

133
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:41,200
evidencing that something fishy is happening here. Waters also covered the very real story of former

134
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,800
President Trump facing another indictment for his role in interfering with the 2020 election.

135
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,840
It was presented like this. Well, it looks like Joe Biden's going to have Trump arrested

136
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,520
again. The only real discussion of the charges here dismisses them offhand and frame the entire

137
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:03,200
thing as Joe Biden trying to keep Trump occupied in court during the electoral campaign. Something

138
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,880
that's entirely conjecture and based on the idea that Biden is simply too infirm to campaign.

139
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,960
Waters is evidence for this. Supposed strategy is this. And here's Joe Biden nearly falling

140
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:30,480
asleep with the Israeli president. This is particularly lazy as these videos of Biden

141
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,360
falling asleep at meetings have been circulated in the past only to be revealed as being deceptively

142
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:41,120
edited. In this case, it's a specific section of footage where if you zoom in, you can see that

143
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,760
Biden isn't falling asleep here. He's reading some notes he placed on his lap. And if you rewind

144
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,000
the tape a little bit, you can see Biden putting those notes on his lap, which might have made it

145
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:56,400
more noticeable. He's not falling asleep. The rest of this segment is dedicated to dunking on CNN

146
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:02,480
for how they're covering the story. CNN turned into TMZ and turned Jack Smith into Tom Cruise. Watch.

147
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:10,480
Turns out even Jack Smith can't resist a $5 foot long. On the point about CNN, fair enough,

148
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,520
covering someone getting a sandwich on their lunch break is deeply silly and reveals how that

149
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,560
channel struggles to fill its 24 hour schedule by wasting air time talking about nonsense.

150
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,120
But how did a story about the indictment of Donald Trump turn into a story dunking on CNN and

151
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,480
hypothesizing that this is all part of Biden's electoral strategy? Probably because it's easier

152
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,880
to mock a media outlet than doing some real investigation into the story itself. If they

153
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,360
really wanted to defend former President Trump, they would dig into the details of the potential

154
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,680
charges, or what little was known about them at the time of this episode, and undermine them with

155
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,480
another set of facts or investigation. Instead of doing that though, they pivoted away from the

156
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:54,000
actual news to instead attack a perceived enemy. Jesse Waters Primetime is not built to handle

157
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,720
breaking news. This is one of the major challenges for commentary programs in general. To provide

158
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,880
interesting or insightful commentary, you often have to wait for a more complete picture of a

159
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,680
news story to be revealed to really analyze it. But by jumping on breaking news, it leads to

160
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,400
stacked judgments that are more often guided by an agenda or ideology than the evidence itself,

161
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,960
and that ultimately becomes what an audience is coming to see, reinforcement of a narrative more

162
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:22,000
so than reporting on the news of the day. Jesse Waters Tonight uses news as an impetus to push

163
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,400
narratives, creating the illusion that people are being informed when really they're just being

164
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,800
taught to think about something else when these news stories are brought up. So when someone

165
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,920
mentions Trump is facing a third indictment, someone who watches Jesse Waters Tonight is

166
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,480
now armed with a talking point about CNN worshipping the lawyer helping bring charges

167
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:46,080
against Trump by covering how he got a sub for lunch. That says nothing about the actual charges

168
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:50,560
against former President Trump, but it does create the vague impression that the media and justice

169
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,840
system are in cahoots to frame Donald Trump. This program isn't unique in that respect,

170
00:14:55,840 --> 00:15:00,320
though it is pretty brazen in how little regard it has for using evidence of any kind to support

171
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,680
its narratives. It reminds me of a segment I saw on Tucker Carlson's program where he turned a

172
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:10,720
cringy White House social media post for a surprise birthday party into some grand gesture

173
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,080
demanding obedience from the people. It's like a room full of aliens have gathered to act out

174
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:22,000
this concept they've just heard about called happiness. Paris suddenly yells surprise at her

175
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,960
own surprise birthday party, like she's hosting the event for one of her multiple personalities.

176
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,120
What the hell is going on here? Jesse Waters doesn't have that kind of heft to his commentary,

177
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:38,800
he's not talking about the Democrats being in league with the powerful elites that are trying

178
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,880
to control everything you do and end white people in America. He just sort of calls the Democrats

179
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,080
corrupt, refers to them vaguely as the powers that be, and moves on from there. It's more toothless

180
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:54,960
than the toxic stuff you would see coming from Tucker Carlson. Boilerplate stories are the ones

181
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,160
that make up the bulk of Jesse Water Prime Time's news coverage. While every story Waters comments

182
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,120
on is tied to some kind of narrative, these are the stories that, if not for the narratives

183
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,320
attached to them, likely wouldn't be covered as news. As a point of comparison, a former president

184
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,120
being indicted is big news no matter what political decision you take. A former NBA player

185
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,400
supporting trans people at an event is not a big news story, unless you want to weave it into a

186
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:25,040
larger narrative regarding trans acceptance in the mainstream. This cuts in both directions,

187
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,080
by the way. Whether you want to use this clear sign of trans acceptance going up as a good thing

188
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,200
or a bad thing. Case in point, here's Jesse Waters covering that story on July 17th.

189
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,560
Of course, some context is missing from that clip. Here are the part of Charles

190
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,040
Berkeley's comments that weren't included in the clip.

191
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:29,760
Also, this is apparently something Charles Berkeley does pretty regularly.

192
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,920
The Berkeley non-story tumbles into another story about the live-action Snow White being more

193
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:50,000
inclusive, which tumbles into an image of some performers using the washroom. This is how quickly

194
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,720
Jesse Waters primetime moves from subject to subject within the same segment. All of this

195
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,560
eventually leads to an interview with an anti-trans activist. This new terminology was the language

196
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:06,720
of female erasure that would be used to take away my own sex-based rights. All of these little

197
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,360
stories and the quick interview are done within less than five minutes, and they all serve the

198
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,080
same purpose. A generalized anti-LGBT, more specifically anti-trans, message. A popular

199
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,360
narrative on the right and Fox News specifically. These little stories don't say much of anything

200
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,600
on their own, but the interview ties them to this narrative of some kind of coordinated effort that

201
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,640
apparently Charles Berkeley and Disney are working on together to trans everyone. These tiny pieces

202
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,920
of information are merely meant to reaffirm something someone was convinced of a while before.

203
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,760
None of these news stories are particularly newsworthy, but the narrative is all that matters

204
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,920
here, which is why they found their way onto this supposed news program. It's a triumph of

205
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:55,600
narrative over news. Another example of one of these boilerplate stories, and this was all over

206
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:01,840
Fox News in general, was the supposed cancellation of the Jason Aldean song, Try That in a Small

207
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,640
Town, and by canceled, they mean not having his video played on the Country Music Television

208
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,400
channel. The story was worth segments on the 18th and 19th, even opening an episode where nearly

209
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:29,680
15 minutes was spent talking about it. A more cynical reading of this, and one I ascribe to,

210
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:34,640
is that this whole idea of getting canceled is largely a marketing ploy. Jason Aldean has

211
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,040
courted controversy in the past, and that's gotten him coverage in the mainstream press.

212
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:43,920
Every time one of his controversial statements is in any way condemned, it's then flipped to make

213
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:49,280
him some kind of martyr, endearing him to the audience that watches Fox News. It's obviously

214
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:55,040
not a coincidence that, after getting canceled, Aldean's song hit number one on iTunes. The only

215
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,600
thing even remotely interesting about this story is that Aldean's song includes the lyrics,

216
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:05,040
cuss out a cop, spit in his face, stomp on the flag and light it up. Yeah, you think you're tough.

217
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,560
We'll try that in a small town. See how far you make it down the road.

218
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,840
First off, if you spit in a cop's face anywhere, big town or small town, that cop will almost

219
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,200
certainly arrest you. But what's really interesting is that line about stomping or burning the flag.

220
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,200
That's protected speech out of the First Amendment. It's ironic for someone to cry

221
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,600
censorship when their song includes a lyric about censoring the political speech of someone else,

222
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,080
and based on the lyrics, it doesn't sound like he's after some kind of friendly conversation.

223
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,840
And this water segment is an absolute joke when, in the very same episode,

224
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,040
we see Waters complaining about the new live-action Snow White movie,

225
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,720
insisting that they hire little people for the role of the Seven Dwarves.

226
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,560
Were Seven Dwarves not diverse enough for Disney? Think about what's better,

227
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,680
Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, or Snow White and the Six Unemployed Dwarves.

228
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,200
Disney has the artistic freedom to make any kind of movie they want,

229
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,400
and Waters is free to criticize them. It just seems strange that,

230
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,160
when someone criticizes Jason Aldean, it's considered censorship,

231
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,800
but not when Waters criticizes Disney.

232
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:08,720
These are the boilerplate stories that masquerade as news to push a narrative.

233
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,600
And while these are trivial stories, the narratives that are attached create the danger.

234
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,480
What's being fought over here is not the right to free expression,

235
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:20,640
but the policing of what sort of speech is acceptable in public spaces.

236
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,800
Contrasting these two stories can tell you a lot. When it comes to right-wing media,

237
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,160
a music video being pulled is an attack on American values.

238
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:34,000
When it comes to supposed left-wing media, it's an outside ideology infecting the population.

239
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,360
And by left-wing, we're talking about the very mild inclusivity of a soulless Disney movie.

240
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,200
So calling that left-wing is too generously adopting the right's framing.

241
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,680
It's more like centrist liberal messaging.

242
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,480
The idea here is to make even though centrist ideas appear far left,

243
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,240
and to police what sort of discourse is acceptable in popular culture.

244
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,320
The easiest way to do that is to engage with anything deemed popular,

245
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,200
and using that to frame any part of it that is left to conservative as extreme.

246
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,320
It both normalizes the right-wing position,

247
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,720
and makes any sort of centrist or left-wing position seem unthinkable.

248
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,200
As much as we might want to ignore these stories,

249
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,920
I do think it's important to acknowledge what they are.

250
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,120
It's not just a dopey guy chasing ratings with a ginned up story about something from pop culture,

251
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,480
although it is that too.

252
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:27,520
It's also an attempt to fight off even the mildest form of non-conservative messaging and culture.

253
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,800
It would be easy to ignore if millions of people weren't watching this,

254
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,880
and internalizing these messages.

255
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,560
While we roll our eyes,

256
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:40,640
people are mobilized on social media to harass actresses for daring to appear in certain movies.

257
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,960
And again, this is about a version of Snow White that has fairly modest, centrist inclusivity.

258
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,680
A true leftist Snow White would end with the prince abandoning the monarchy to join Snow White's

259
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,840
multiracial, polycule co-op where they live sustainably in harmony with nature,

260
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:01,040
taking brief breaks to disseminate anti-monarchist literature to foment rebellion in the kingdom.

261
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,080
And a media controlled by the left would let a bad country music slowly fade away into obscurity.

262
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,480
Because without the whole, canceling narrative,

263
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,720
everyone was happy to ignore this Jason Aldean song when it came out nearly two months ago

264
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,400
before the video was pulled.

265
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,680
Although much of the supposed outrage coming from leftists is overblown on this program,

266
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:24,240
there was at least one genuine piece of news that was upsetting.

267
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,640
Plowback over Florida's updated school curriculum that included language instructing

268
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,480
teachers to mention the benefits enslaved people got from slavery,

269
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,560
bringing a false sense of balance to what is an obviously hideous institution.

270
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,200
Here's an interesting bit of gaslighting from Waters.

271
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,760
Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which in some instances could be applied

272
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,200
for their personal benefit.

273
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,560
That's the section everyone's freaking out about.

274
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:53,040
I always hesitate to use the term gaslighting because it's so overused,

275
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,240
but in this case, I don't know how else to describe this.

276
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,200
Let's put Waters' statement here on the screen and compare it to what he says just seconds later.

277
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,200
No one is arguing slaves benefited from slavery.

278
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,280
No one is saying that.

279
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,080
It's not true.

280
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,760
They're teaching how black people developed skills during slavery in some instances that

281
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:17,040
could be applied for their own personal benefit.

282
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,280
He says no one benefited from slavery and then says that enslaved people learned skills that

283
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,280
they then benefited from.

284
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,400
It's incredible that he thinks no one can see through this.

285
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,920
The authors of this part of the curriculum defended their choice of words and offered

286
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:35,920
a list of examples of supposed former enslaved people who used the skills they were forced

287
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,200
to learn to their benefit.

288
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,360
A Twitter user by the name of Alexander went through the list one by one, highlighting

289
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,560
how the majority of these examples cited were never enslaved.

290
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,960
And in one case, one of the examples was George Washington's white sister.

291
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,880
Here it is broken down in a handy chart.

292
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,120
Of the 16 names cited, two of them, maybe, fit the criteria of someone formerly enslaved

293
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:01,040
who used the skills learned while enslaved in their personal life afterwards.

294
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:06,800
The two African-American academics who crafted this school curriculum don't appear to be the

295
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:12,080
best choice for crafting a curriculum when their knowledge of history is so weak.

296
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,440
But this is hardly a lesson worth learning at all.

297
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,320
The lived reality for many of the people who were enslaved, the ones who were eventually freed and

298
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,280
the many, many more who weren't, was not one where they acquired any sorts of skills of their

299
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,160
own choosing.

300
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:30,400
These were all forced on them so they could be exploited by people who owned them.

301
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,520
When it comes to slavery or any sort of historic event, there are numerous facts that one could

302
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,400
include or not include that help shape the impression of young students when it's taught

303
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,080
in a school curriculum.

304
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,280
Trying to evoke any kind of upside to slavery is a mockery of the horrors of that institution

305
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:53,040
and brings with it a false sense of balance, as if this horrible period of history requires

306
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,360
some kind of silver lining.

307
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,520
So Waters isn't entirely wrong in this case when he says the left is outraged.

308
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,840
A curriculum written by people ignorant of history trying to soften the impact of slavery

309
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,920
to a generation of children in Florida is something worth getting angry about.

310
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,840
The next group of stories I want to talk about that I noticed on Jesse Waters Primetime are

311
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,520
the non-stories.

312
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
These are stories that, once again, serve a narrative but don't even have the tenuous

313
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,880
link to that narrative that a low-stakes boilerplate story has.

314
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,120
These are some of the most weak attempts to present a facsimile of news that's designed

315
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,080
to feed into the fear and paranoia of the audience.

316
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,120
Here's one example from the July 17th episode.

317
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,200
It's about a federal grant of $16 million that is being used to help complete two trails

318
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,000
in Connecticut.

319
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,960
This grant is finishing a project that completes an 84-mile trail connecting the towns of Plainville

320
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,920
and New Britain.

321
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,400
Here's what that segment looked like.

322
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,520
New Britain, Connecticut was given $17 million in infrastructure money from Joe Biden

323
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,240
for an anti-racist hiking trail.

324
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,040
Yes, this has somehow become an anti-racist hiking trail.

325
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,920
But before we get to that, here are a few quick corrections.

326
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,720
First off, it's two trails and not one that this money is for, and these trails are for

327
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,000
more than hiking.

328
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,080
One includes a public bus route that would need to be paved and staffed.

329
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,960
Also, Waters had $17 million, but it's actually $16 million, something his employee gets right

330
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
when he goes to speak to the people in New Britain.

331
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,080
$16 million, you could take a hike in the woods.

332
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,440
Does that sound right?

333
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,880
It sounds actually quite boring.

334
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,360
The anti-racist part is the confusing one.

335
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,800
Looking at the official announcement, there's no mention of race at all.

336
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,040
It's part of the Rebuilding America in Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity

337
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:41,280
Program, which is part of the Investing in America initiative, which does include a

338
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,920
small section on racial equity being a priority.

339
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,360
But this specific project?

340
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,840
What would make it anti-racist?

341
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:53,920
The best answer I could come up with is because the population of New Britain is nearly 62%

342
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,960
non-white.

343
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,600
In 2023, the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity Program gave

344
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:06,480
out grants to 162 different projects, and the program has been around in some form since 2009.

345
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,920
Also, this trail project was announced back in 2022.

346
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:13,440
This is all on excuse to send this guide to a community of non-white people to get

347
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,240
a few quick sound bites complaining about a project that's been inaccurately framed.

348
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,160
This is all intercut with footage of goofy jokes to really hammer home how silly this

349
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,640
should all sound, but this isn't news.

350
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,960
It's an old story that's been trotted out to advance a tired narrative of Biden's

351
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,480
infrastructure plan being bad, and since there are 161 other projects getting grants like these,

352
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,720
among many others that are part of the broader initiative, an endless series of segments like

353
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:43,280
these can be produced with no informational value whenever they need to fill some time.

354
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:48,640
It does harken back to the earlier segments Jesse Waters did when he was working for Bill O'Reilly.

355
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:53,520
None of these were really newsworthy either, but they made people laugh and generated anger

356
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,040
towards the right people.

357
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:59,600
My favorite non-story though comes from the July 20th episode where Waters reported on

358
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:03,520
the discovery of an unclassified document that supposedly revealed everything about

359
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,120
Hunter Biden's business dealings that they were not only true but way worse than we realize,

360
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,520
with tapes of Joe Biden making threats and extorting people for millions of dollars.

361
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:20,640
This document details that Joe and Hunter Biden coerced a Ukrainian CEO to bribe them

362
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,760
10 million dollars.

363
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,880
The document genuinely does say all those things.

364
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,160
I read it myself.

365
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,400
Although, crucially, it doesn't actually have direct evidence.

366
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:34,480
It claims there are recordings and bank records that prove everything that's said within them.

367
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,640
But the document itself is just saying that this evidence exists, not actually providing

368
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:41,920
the evidence itself.

369
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:47,600
I'll let you all know right now I have no loyalty to the Biden family or the Biden administration,

370
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:52,240
and it's honestly a bit annoying whenever I have to find myself defending them because it's

371
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,280
important to explain how people like Jesse Waters lie about political stories all the time.

372
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:01,760
If there were real evidence that crimes were committed by anyone in the Biden family or

373
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,640
administration, they should absolutely be investigated.

374
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,040
A scandal like this would be important front page news around the world, and rightfully so.

375
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:12,080
No government official should ever be above the law.

376
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,360
Though the reason this story is coming up so late in my video is probably similar to the reason

377
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,200
even Jesse Waters didn't open his show with news of this document.

378
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,320
It was mentioned in the second segment of that nice program, 12 Minutes In, and he only spent

379
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,320
about two minutes on the story.

380
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,480
It reminds me of the old axiom, big if true.

381
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,600
The statements in this unclassified document come from an FD1023 form.

382
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,280
A message from the FBI explains what type of information these forms contain.

383
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:47,760
FD1023 is the form our special agencies record raw unverified reporting from confidential

384
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,000
human sources, CHSs.

385
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,040
FD1023s merely document that information.

386
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:58,080
They do not reflect the conclusions of investigators based on a fuller context or understanding.

387
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,480
Recording this information does not validate it,

388
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,120
establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI

389
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,800
and our investigations.

390
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,760
That unverified part is particularly crucial, especially since this document comes from

391
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,960
2020.

392
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,200
Not included are any documents that reflect any investigation related to this information,

393
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,240
including whether or not the evidence exists at all.

394
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,480
None of this evidence has been presented anywhere.

395
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:27,520
This raises the possibility that the informant, who provided the information, was either lying

396
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,280
or mistaken about them existing.

397
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,080
Without any additional information, there's really nothing to go on here other than some hearsay.

398
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:38,880
In other words, until the document's information is verified, this is a non-story.

399
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,560
Someone making a false statement to the FBI is non-news.

400
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:47,440
After dropping this bombshell on his July 21st episode, Jesse Waters decided to open his program

401
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,440
with an update on the document.

402
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,800
If the Ukrainians have 17 tapes of the Bidens talking bribes plus bank records,

403
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:59,440
and the President Biden has sent Ukraine billions of dollars for, quote,

404
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,800
as long as it takes, you think the President's being blackmailed.

405
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:09,680
Getting straight to the point, do these tapes exist and is Waters going to play them for us?

406
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,400
And unlike Waters, I'm actually going to answer this question.

407
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,400
No, he doesn't play them for us.

408
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:18,160
And he doesn't show any of the bank records that supposedly exist either.

409
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:22,480
And as of readiness, none of this evidence has come to light.

410
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,920
We can't verify it.

411
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,560
But what we're doing over here is called journalism.

412
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,160
We're trying to verify it.

413
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,760
We're connecting dots.

414
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:33,440
The reason Waters opened this episode mocking other media outlets instead of

415
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,000
reporting on the veracity of the claims made in the document is because, as he just said,

416
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,600
his team hasn't been able to verify the claims made in the document either.

417
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,080
But that won't stop him from using this unverified piece of information to advance a narrative.

418
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:50,000
Jesse Waters claims to be a journalist, but he's not reporting any news here.

419
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,880
The story, if there is one, is that this document was released publicly by Republicans for reasons

420
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,280
that could easily be more political than a genuine attempt at investigating a crime.

421
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:03,280
Republicans using political theater to attack their opponent isn't really newsworthy,

422
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,240
in my opinion, and any journalist reporting on it is in some way complicit in that theater,

423
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:11,600
unless they're pointing out what the Republicans are engaged in here.

424
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,400
But Waters goes a step further by treating it true until proven false.

425
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:20,000
It's the triumph of narrative over evidence once again.

426
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,680
I mentioned the cocaine story earlier as a form of real news,

427
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:28,000
because even though it's less important than the president supposedly being blackmailed,

428
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:32,560
the key difference here is that there's evidence that someone actually left cocaine in the White

429
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,200
House, and there's still no evidence anything in this form is in any way true.

430
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,560
Now, I've been covering this Biden corruption story for a while now,

431
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:45,760
and I can feel it's finally breaking through. What about you?

432
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,960
This is how Waters wants his audience to understand the story.

433
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,680
He wants them to feel like it's true.

434
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:56,640
Not actually think it's true based on the evidence presented, just have that feeling it's true.

435
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,080
This last section is a collection of some bad stuff I saw in this program that I honestly

436
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,400
just don't know how to classify. The first are segments that were just advertisements

437
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,360
for politicians dressed up as a news story and interview.

438
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:13,680
On July 20th, we had a ridiculous interview with Ron DeSantis where he was making a big

439
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:18,480
deal of pulling the investments of the Florida Pension Fund out of Anheuser-Busch.

440
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:23,040
This is in response to the value of the company going down, supposedly of the backlash to the

441
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,560
advertising campaign featuring trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney. And by advertising campaign,

442
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,600
I mean they sent Mulvaney a can of beer and they made a TikTok video about it.

443
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:38,240
Middle class workers with pensions are seeing their portfolios implode.

444
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,520
So Florida police officers, teachers, firefighters are witnessing their retirement funds collapse.

445
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,600
Bud Light went woke and first responders went broke.

446
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,000
This sounds pretty drastic. People are supposedly going broke because of this slide in the stock.

447
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,960
Using the number Waters has given us, a drop in valuation of $16 billion since April,

448
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,120
we can compare that to Anheuser-Busch's current value of $116 billion

449
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:04,160
on the date this episode was broadcast, July 20th.

450
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,040
$16 billion out of the former value means Waters is counting this from when the company was valued

451
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,840
at $132 billion on April 1st. So roughly a drop of 12%.

452
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:18,080
Governor DeSantis gives us more information on how much of this drop affected Florida pensions.

453
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,040
So a loss of 12% of value from $50 million would mean a loss of $6 million

454
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:41,920
out of $180 billion or roughly 0.003% of the pension was lost because of wokeness.

455
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,680
I think it makes it painfully clear how little an issue this is

456
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:51,040
and it's hardly worth the governor personally intervening. Though this is effective as PR to

457
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,680
make DeSantis appear as some kind of warrior protecting the people of Florida from wokeness,

458
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,440
lest they lose 3 thousandths of a percent of their pensions.

459
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,280
We can see something similar in the July 19th episode where Ted Cruz was brought on so they

460
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,120
can rage against the Barbie movie for supposedly including a map influenced by Chinese propaganda.

461
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:17,760
If you see right here, next to Asia, shows the nine dashes. Now those dashes signify

462
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,520
Chinese ownership of the ocean, islands, and reefs. The Chinese believe they own the South

463
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:28,880
China Sea. But they don't. So why did the Barbie movie bow to China?

464
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,960
I should point out first that the map actually has eight dashes, not nine.

465
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,360
And it's not drawing a border. Those dashes are actually Barbie's journey from Barbieland to the

466
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:41,760
real world, at least according to a representative from Mattel. I actually haven't seen the movie.

467
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:47,120
Also, I think it's pretty obvious that this map is not meant to accurately reflect the real world.

468
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:52,800
It kind of looks like it was drawn by a child. When Cruz is interviewed, he reveals that he

469
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,600
hasn't seen the movie, but he does have some new legislation ready to fight Chinese censorship.

470
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:02,480
I introduced legislation, it's called the script act that says the federal government

471
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,440
will not allow movie makers to use US government assets, things like jets or tanks or ships or

472
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,320
helicopters, if they allow the Chinese government to censor their films.

473
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,560
US Department of Defense already has immense influence over movies produced by big studios

474
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:24,640
as it is. To get approval for using any US military assets like planes and tanks, potentially saving

475
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:29,440
a production millions of dollars, scripts have to be approved by the US Department of Defense.

476
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,000
These approvals sometimes include suggestions to change movie scripts to more kindly reflect

477
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,360
the actions of the US military. Many movies, which studios are trying to reduce the budget of,

478
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:43,920
will happily agree to these terms to get access to some of these valuable assets.

479
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,520
Ted Cruz's legislation is just empowering this form of governmental oversight on film productions,

480
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,600
making sure that a studio will have to avoid anything seemingly favorable to the Chinese

481
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:58,240
government, bringing it more in line with the official position of the US government.

482
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,560
If the influence of China is considered censorship by refusing access to a market,

483
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,400
this is just American censorship with a different incentive structure,

484
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,760
refusing access to millions of dollars saved in production.

485
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,280
All that said, I'm not sure how many movies this would apply to.

486
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,000
Most movies featuring the military are already mostly pro-American, and those that aren't don't

487
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,960
typically come out spouting Chinese propaganda. This really just seems like another publicity

488
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,160
stunt to create, the illusion of a politician passing legislation that will protect the people

489
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:33,760
from Chinese censorship when, in reality, it's just a bunch of hollow posturing.

490
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,720
There are another bunch of segments that I really don't know how to talk about,

491
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,320
aside from pointing out how silly they are, like the one about sharks.

492
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,000
Watch out for sharks.

493
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,040
Or alligators.

494
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,240
The gator hopped right out of the water and chased him halfway home.

495
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,240
Guy's lucky to be alive.

496
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,320
And then there were the cocaine sharks.

497
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,720
Bales of coke are now washing up in the oceans,

498
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:00,240
and marine biologists are worried that sharks, yeah, are eating the coke.

499
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,760
Oh, and sex robots.

500
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,800
They will eliminate the need for real women.

501
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,360
Do you believe that?

502
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,760
And did you know that Joe Biden got new shoes?

503
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,280
Joe Biden's wearing sneakers now.

504
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,920
He's been rocking a no sock look, too.

505
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:16,480
What about the Amish? Did you know that they're healthy?

506
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:20,960
A research foundation found that the Amish are the healthiest people in America.

507
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,200
That last one isn't true, by the way.

508
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,640
The Amish have a lot of health issues, specifically genetic disorders.

509
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:31,680
Though the reason they bring on Steve Kirsh is to push some big anti-vaccine nonsense.

510
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,000
These stories, of course, are all tied to narratives as well.

511
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,560
It's just hard to talk about every single one of them,

512
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,360
because they're usually very minimal and deeply silly.

513
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:43,680
Back in 2020, Fox News was sued over some comments Tucker Carlson made on his program

514
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,880
about Karen McDougall.

515
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,680
Fox News successfully defended Carlson by arguing that,

516
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,840
and this is a quote from the judge's opinion,

517
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,360
the general tenor of the show should then inform a viewer that

518
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:57,200
Carlson is not stating actual facts about the topics he discusses

519
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,760
and is instead engaging in exaggeration and non-literal commentary.

520
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,440
This has been broadly understood to mean that Fox News' lawyers were arguing

521
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:09,440
that no audience would ever believe Tucker Carlson was telling the truth about anything.

522
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,840
The actual opinion is a bit more narrow,

523
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:14,960
using details of the script to say that it should have been clear that

524
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,560
Carlson's statements were in that particular episode,

525
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,560
and I'm quoting from the judge's opinion here,

526
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,320
exaggeration, non-literal commentary were simply

527
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,560
bloviating for his audience.

528
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,120
This speaks to how scripts on Fox News are written,

529
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:32,480
and something that can be seen in the same work Jesse Waters does.

530
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,880
One of the tougher things to nail down when covering Waters,

531
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,040
or any of these more polished presenters,

532
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,960
is that their scripts are put together with caveats and other rhetorical protections

533
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,960
to protect them from being tied to the narratives they're so obviously pushing.

534
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,440
They use questions and offer assumptions,

535
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:50,000
though when you see the pattern of these questions and assumptions,

536
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,640
they always point things in the same direction.

537
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:56,800
It protects the hosts from the liability of making these claims

538
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,600
while still advancing them in the minds of their viewers.

539
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,360
To use a more controversial example,

540
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:04,720
whenever someone has questions about a genocide,

541
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:08,880
it only ever seems to be questions that suggest it wasn't as bad as people think,

542
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,800
or that it possibly never happened.

543
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,520
The questions never seem to wonder that it might have been even worse or more widespread,

544
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,960
because these questions are searching for a specific answer.

545
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,600
It's how you deny something horrible happened without actually saying it outright.

546
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,360
You simply ask questions and let the audience answer them in their head.

547
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:31,280
The assumptions are even more telling as leaps of logic are taken as facts,

548
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,200
always moving toward the same conclusion.

549
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,760
Here's a segment from July 27th that really show that in action.

550
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,080
It starts off with a single piece of evidence,

551
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,480
a statement from a supposed IRS whistleblower,

552
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,560
and we're going to see how this program twists it.

553
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,920
The IRS whistleblowers confirm when I asked

554
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:53,040
if they had documents pertaining to foreign accounts and they said they did.

555
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,760
So with regard to the Hunter Biden investigation,

556
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
foreign accounts are a part of it.

557
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,120
Now let's look at the speculation.

558
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:03,280
With Joe, I suspect there are offshore accounts.

559
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,800
Based on what Comer has said,

560
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,320
he is speculating that the account or accounts belong to Joe Biden.

561
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,840
Looking at his original statement,

562
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,800
we don't even have confirmation that it belongs to any Biden,

563
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,120
just that in this whole story, a foreign account or accounts were used.

564
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,440
Then water starts to grow that speculation.

565
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:24,400
IRS whistleblowers have indicated that they have documents suggesting that the Biden family,

566
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:27,920
possibly Joe Biden himself, are hiding money offshore.

567
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,720
Sources tell Primetime they have not seen the documents yet,

568
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,040
but when they do, it goes through a vote and then the documents will be released.

569
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,640
Notice that even though he opens with speculation,

570
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,160
he tempers all of that, kind of protecting himself when he says that

571
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,880
we won't know any more details about these bank accounts,

572
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:48,560
as they have to go through the House Ways and Means Committee to be approved for release first.

573
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:53,120
But that doesn't stop him from building on that speculation with a series of questions.

574
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,400
Why would Joe Biden receive money through shell companies from his son?

575
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,840
And why wouldn't Joe Biden have an offshore bank account?

576
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,920
We don't even have evidence that this account or accounts belong to Joe Biden,

577
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:07,280
but these questions make sense if you're willing to join waters on this ride

578
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,360
that just assumes that to be the case.

579
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:12,640
I note how the questions all seem to be moving towards the same answer,

580
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:16,960
that Joe Biden has some suspicious foreign bank accounts for a nefarious purpose.

581
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,640
And then we get to the conclusion.

582
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:23,680
Once you start zeroing in on foreign, foreign bank accounts, foreign lobbying,

583
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:28,400
foreign agents, foreign business partners, foreign policy, foreign deals,

584
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:31,040
that's fertile ground for impeachment.

585
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:35,360
That's when you get into conspiracy, money laundering, even treason.

586
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:39,280
And that's why this looks more and more like a bribery ring.

587
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,440
So what we have here is bribery.

588
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:44,240
And I'll remind you, this all started from the fact that

589
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:49,120
someone said that this case involves foreign accounts and that is morphed into

590
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,960
Joe Biden is being bribed.

591
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,400
This is how the assumptions made by Waters and the questions he asked

592
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,680
move the audience towards specific conclusions that

593
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,720
Joe Biden is involved in some kind of elaborate corruption

594
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,520
and no real evidence of any of that is presented.

595
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,240
It's all very circumstantial and speculative.

596
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,600
Waters has proven that he can work in unison with Fox News more broadly,

597
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:11,920
pushing narratives the channel finds useful.

598
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,880
And unlike Tucker Carlson, he doesn't stray as obviously

599
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:19,600
into the white nationalist talking points, aside from the one or two odd turns.

600
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,480
Waters mostly stays in the realm of the mainstream right.

601
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,800
And he would sooner spend the rest of his time

602
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,800
complaining about infrastructure to attack anti-racism

603
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,800
and not using stories of men tanning their balls to advance fascism.

604
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,120
Waters, as a product of the Fox News system,

605
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:37,440
is probably the perfect guy for the role he's in.

606
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:40,800
And the few weeks we got of others trying out for the APM slot

607
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:45,040
were probably to make sure he wasn't too obviously seen as Tucker Carlson's replacement,

608
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:47,760
ensuring that the audience wouldn't turn on him right away.

609
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,520
All Jesse Waters needs to do is keep his nose clean and not get into any trouble.

610
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,800
And he can probably enjoy a long career telling the Fox News audience

611
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,200
exactly what they want to hear, unless he runs his mouth and gets himself into trouble.

612
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,720
I did let the air out of her tires.

613
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,280
She couldn't go anywhere.

614
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,000
She needed a lift.

615
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,200
I said, hey, you need a lift?

616
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,320
She got right in the car.

617
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,280
Does she know this story?

618
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,560
No, she doesn't know the story.

619
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,000
Did she watch your shows?

Did Jesse watch?

00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,920
Credit to Juliet Jeske for popularizing that clip.

622
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,280
Also, her publicly available research helped provide some additional context

623
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,440
for Fox News more broadly while working on this video.

624
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,320
Check out her stuff on Decoding Fox News if you get the chance.

625
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:30,720
And for the record, in that clip, Jesse Waters has claimed that he was just joking.

626
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,240
What absolutely isn't a joke is that at the time, Waters' future wife was working for him.

627
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,960
And she's also the woman he cheated on his first wife with.

628
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,800
So he seems like a lovely guy.

629
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,280
It does make one thing that his future might not be entirely dissimilar from his mentor, Bill O'Reilly.

630
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,760
I guess we'll see what becomes of Waters and his dollar store David Schwimmer haircut.

631
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:56,240
One thing I wanted to laugh at but didn't really know how to talk about in the video

632
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,600
was the fact that at the end of every episode, Jesse Waters has a tagline where he says,

633
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,320
I'm Jesse Waters and this is my world.

634
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:07,840
From the look on his face when he does it, you can tell he's so proud he came up with it.

635
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:11,280
And it's also maybe one of the worst things I've ever heard.

636
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:15,360
I don't know why you'd want your catchphrase to be modeled after one of the most famous

637
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,360
box office bombs in history.

638
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:20,560
But I would never accuse Jesse Waters of ever being clever.

639
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,640
But if you think I'm clever and would like to support me through some sort of

640
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,760
financial means, you can become like all the lovely names you see floating up the screen now

641
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,400
by joining my Patreon and supporting me there.

642
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,680
You can also become a YouTube member if that's more convenient for you.

643
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,320
If you haven't already, I also suggest you like, comment, subscribe, and hit the bell

644
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:41,680
for notifications.

645
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,840
If you don't know what to comment, why not share your favorite box office bomb?

646
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:49,760
Extra points if you can somehow weave it into a clever sign off.

647
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,320
Like, I'll be black in a flash.

648
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:55,840
Thank you all so much for watching.
