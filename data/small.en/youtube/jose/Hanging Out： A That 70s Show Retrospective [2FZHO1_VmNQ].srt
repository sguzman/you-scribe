1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
Through the haze of time gone by, and a loose spliff or two, came one of the first sitcoms to

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,600
take a nostalgic look back at the 1970s. With a knowing laugh at the fashion and trends of the

3
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:14,080
day, that 70s show served as a reminder of how things had changed over the last two decades,

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,440
and how much had stayed the same. When it debuted in 1998, the series was an instant hit,

5
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:23,840
becoming one of the breakout comedies for Fox in the late 90s, and launching the careers of its

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,800
cast. Many shows have imitated it since, but the unique chemistry of the characters and the

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,440
inventive style of its production made it a tough act to follow. The idea for the series began with

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:38,080
a business meeting at the Carsey-Warner Company, a production company that had been responsible for

9
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,040
such hits, including The Cosby Show, Roseanne, and Third Rock from the Sun. During the meeting,

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,880
it was suggested that they should start focusing their attention on producing a show for men from

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:53,040
ages 18 to 49. Karen Mandebach, who was working for the company, was struck with a sudden inspiration.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,360
Mandebach pitched the idea of doing a show set in the 70s to Bonnie and Terry Turner, who had

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,800
recently created Third Rock from the Sun for NBC. The husband and wife duo teamed with writer Mark

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,160
Brazil to create a pitch for what would eventually become that 70s show. The series drew heavily from

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:18,560
the lives of its creators, hearkening back to their days growing up in the 1970s, though

16
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,000
crucially what made the series what it was, was not its reliance on making references to the decade,

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,040
but rather a memorable cast of characters who just happened to be living in the 1970s.

18
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,120
Memories of the era would appeal to an older demographic, while the drama of the teens would

19
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,680
appeal to a younger one. The show's creators produced a script for a series called Teenage

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:42,160
Wasteland, and while it wouldn't keep that name, it did reflect the idea of a group of teenagers

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,800
trapped in a small town with nothing to do but hang out. Set in the fictional town of Point Place,

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,680
Wisconsin, shows were less about cheering on the Packers, although they did that on occasion,

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,720
and more about creating a dynamic that was driven by its characters rather than its premise.

24
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,640
Topher Grace was chosen for the role of Eric Foreman through an odd twist of fate. He was

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,240
starring in his school's production of Our Town with the daughter of the show's creators,

26
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,320
Bonnie and Terry Turner. He impressed them so much, they brought him into audition,

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:12,160
and he got the part. The character is loosely based on writer Mark Brazil.

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,920
Eric is an awkward everyman teenage boy in Love with the Girl Next Door.

29
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,520
Laura Prepon played the role of Donna Pinciotti. Prepon was working as a model before trying her

30
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,840
hand at acting, and she turned out a movie role after becoming enamored with a part of Donna.

31
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,160
Donna is the tomboy of the group, with dreams outside the small town of Point Place.

32
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,880
She's also exploring her feelings for her neighbor Eric.

33
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:53,840
Ashton Kutcher took a direct route to his role of Michael Kelso. He had been working as a model

34
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,400
for about a year and was incredibly lucky with one of his earliest auditions being for Teenage

35
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,600
Wasteland. He was immediately a favorite of the show's creators. Kelso is the handsome,

36
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,400
yet deeply naive member of the teenage group of friends.

37
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,760
Danny Masterson was cast as Stephen Hyde. He had been performing on stage since he was eight,

38
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,920
when he had a role on Broadway, and had since gone on to appear in hundreds of commercials.

39
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,760
His input helped define the character, giving Hyde a harder edge.

40
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,560
Hyde is the street smart troublemaker of the group. He has a healthy distrust of authority

41
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:48,080
and an even healthier stash of pot. Wilmer Valderrama was cast for the role of the foreign

42
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,960
exchange student Fez. Although born in Miami, he grew up in Venezuela, giving him an authentic

43
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,760
accent that made him appeal to the show's creators. Fez is the perpetual fish out of water,

44
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,600
taken under the guidance of his new American friends. Although we never quite learn where

45
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,920
Fez is from, or what his name even is, he's still embraced as part of the gang.

46
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,640
Mila Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhardt. Originally born in Ukraine, her family moved

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,880
to America when she was seven, and she took acting classes to help with her English.

48
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,040
She quickly found success with a number of parts but went on auditioning for the role of Jackie,

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:40,960
which was looking for a 16-year-old. She lied about her age to get cast. Jackie is a spoiled

50
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,760
rich kid, only barely tolerable in the group because of her romantic connection to Kelso.

51
00:04:46,560 --> 00:05:00,960
Deborah Jo Rupp was cast as Eric's mother, Kitty Foreman. Although a very experienced actress,

52
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,600
she had largely been doing guest roles on shows such as Seinfeld or in movies like Big. Kitty is

53
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,680
the picture-perfect image of a mother figure, holding her family together through freshly baked

54
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,480
cookies and a well-kept home. Although she's not exactly a homebody, as she also works as a nurse

55
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:31,840
to help the family through some tough financial times. Kurtwood Smith was cast as Eric's father,

56
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,240
Red Foreman, a longtime veteran of the screen. At the time, he was probably best remembered

57
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
for his role in Robocop. Red is the perpetual hard-ass, determined to make his son into the

58
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,360
man he expects him to be. When the show begins, he's struggling to put food on the table as his

59
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:58,960
job as manager at an auto parts factory is in peril. Don Stark was cast as Bob Pinciati,

60
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,960
Donna's father. Another prolific actor, he had appeared in numerous shows and movies in the

61
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:07,600
years leading up to this role. Bob is the trendy appliance store owner next door who's not afraid

62
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:24,240
of wearing his heart on his sleeve. Midge Pinciati, played by Tanya Roberts, was the final member of

63
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:29,120
the Pinciati household. An actress plucked from the 70s, Roberts joined Charlie's Angels in the

64
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,520
show's fifth season. She was also one of the Bond girls in A View to a Kill and starred in the movie

65
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,240
Sheena. Midge is the flighty lady next door who is exploring the exciting world of feminism.

66
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,840
Although the principal cast was quite large, it would grow larger still in later seasons,

67
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,720
and it would also shrink when some of the actors departed. But the action was primarily driven by

68
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,280
its main cast of teenagers, always ready to assemble in the formant basement. The theme

69
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:06,880
song of the series was a cover of the Big Star song In the Street. The cover was originally

70
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,040
performed by Todd Griffin for the first season of the series, but a new version was recorded by

71
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,280
Cheap Trick that would be used in seasons two through eight. When a music video is released

72
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,720
for the song, the cast even appeared alongside Cheap Trick. After the pilot was filmed, one of

73
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,360
the few things still missing was the title for the show. Teenage Wasteland was out as the show's

74
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,520
creators couldn't get the rights to that from The Who. Several other titles inspired by popular

75
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,320
music of the era faced similar problems, including such names as The Kids Are All Right.

76
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,600
Eventually that became Feelin' All Right, but Fox didn't particularly like the sound of that.

77
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,600
During test screenings of the pilot, audiences kept calling it That 70s Show.

78
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,880
That's what the audience kept calling it. They had no clue what the title was. They just

79
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,080
referred to it as That 70s Show. So we stopped fighting it and went with it.

80
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:05,280
Point Place, Wisconsin, May 17th, 1976, 847 p.m. Location, Eric Forman's Basement.

81
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,440
This is how we're introduced to the gang of That 70s Show, debuting in the real world on August

82
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,280
23rd, 1998. This first episode was called That 70s Pilot. We meet Eric, Donna, Hyde, and Kelso

83
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:24,400
in the basement, with the latter three encouraging Eric to do his teenage duty and steal some beer

84
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:34,480
from his parents who are having a party upstairs. As Eric goes upstairs, we get our first look at

85
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,480
That 70s Show's unique style with a first-person view from Eric's perspective.

86
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,160
One fun bit of trivia here is that we get the first appearance of Kitty's iconic laugh,

87
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,160
a laugh that was done accidentally.

88
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:20,160
We also get our first sign that Donna and Eric are into each other.

89
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:48,160
The Jackie and Kelso relationship is also established.

90
00:09:48,160 --> 00:10:07,280
We also get our very first circle, which is how the teens on the show would gather while getting

91
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:13,040
high. You couldn't show someone smoking pot on a TV show, but That 70s Show got around this by

92
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,760
moving the camera on someone just after they had taken a puff. That way it simulates a joint,

93
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:22,480
being passed around in a circle without actually showing the joint itself. You can even see the

94
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,360
characters break into laughter a few times, which was kept in because it seemed authentic. They just

95
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,840
have the giggles because they're high. The show had some fun with high Eric when he has to speak

96
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:36,480
to his parents, and he finds out that he's getting the vista cruiser. This is another fun example of

97
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:46,080
its creative style. Future episodes would also take liberties with split screens and

98
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:50,480
voiceovers and edits to create something that you often didn't see in sitcoms of the day.

99
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,640
With a new set of wheels, Eric and his friends go out of town to a concert and get up to some

100
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,840
shenanigans. But the key part of this episode happens at the end with a pivotal moment for Don

101
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:40,640
and Eric. This first episode establishes the characters very quickly. We know who they are

102
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,880
and how they relate to one another. This show will be primarily about Eric discovering his

103
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,440
first love and rebelling against a domineering father. What also makes the show feel genuine

104
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,600
is that, while you can certainly tell it's set in the 70s, the kids aren't slavishly following

105
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,000
the trends to set up cheap jokes. They have their own tastes, and the humour is built around that.

106
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:14,720
In this example, Eric and Donna are mocking the Brady Bunch, but Jackie is a fan. It shows us that

107
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,360
Jackie is into the trendy sitcoms of the day, whereas Eric and Donna are more outsiders to

108
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,480
pop culture. Jackie is conventional, while Eric and Donna aren't. This is how the decade informs

109
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,200
us about the characters, rather than using the characters as a vessel to explore the decade. In

110
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:34,160
other words, it's how it establishes itself as a character-driven comedy rather than a premise-driven

111
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,120
one. It's also interesting how it reframes memories of the 70s. It's not a show from that decade,

112
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,720
after all. Rather, it's a show about what people from the 90s remembered about the 70s. And sitting

113
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,120
here, over 20 years later, were even more removed from the era. As someone who wasn't alive in 1976,

114
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,520
I have no idea if teenagers mocked the Brady Bunch or not. But I do remember what it was like

115
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,840
to have my first kiss, which is a big part of why the show is so fondly remembered. Not because it

116
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:04,640
captured an era, but because it presented memorable characters whose experiences transcended that time

117
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:09,360
period. We get another example in the very next episode, Eric's birthday. Eric wants a cassette

118
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,640
player for the Vista Cruiser, and not an eight-track player.

119
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:16,240
The point is, I don't want an eight-track tape player.

120
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,200
Then you won't get one.

121
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,480
Oh, but honey, he wants one.

122
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,680
No, I want a tape player, just not an eight-track.

123
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
So naturally, he gets this.

124
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,000
I mean, yeah.

125
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,200
It's an eight-track tape player.

126
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,600
I see that.

127
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,800
Just what you asked for.

128
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
You made such a big deal about it, I wrote it down.

129
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:39,440
If a 17-year-old was watching this episode, would they know the difference between an

130
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,680
eight-track and a cassette player? Here's a picture of both of them. A lesser show would

131
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,520
have had the characters hold up a cassette player and make a comment about it being cutting-edge

132
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,560
technology, never to be surpassed. That might get a chuckle, but it's a laugh you probably wouldn't

133
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,120
remember. On that 70s show, it's not about laughing at the technology of the past. It's

134
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,200
about laughing at growing up with parents who don't listen. That's something you can laugh at

135
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,840
and relate to, and it's what makes this show particularly memorable. Eric's birthday also

136
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:10,560
introduced another important first, Eric's sister, Laurie, played by Lisa Robin Kelly.

137
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,000
Hello, Laurie.

138
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,040
Red treats Laurie a little differently than he does Eric.

139
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,120
Laurie, you're not driving a vista cruiser.

140
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,600
It's old and undependable.

141
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,800
It could break down, you'd be at the mercy of any maniac who came along.

142
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:29,440
That's okay for Eric, but you're taking a Toyota.

143
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,680
And I should mention, not every scene in the circle involved passing a joint around.

144
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,000
That 70s show ran for eight seasons, though it only took place over roughly three and a half

145
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,080
years. If you've ever been watching an episode and wondering when exactly you are, at the end

146
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:45,680
of the opening credits when we see the vista cruiser's license plate, the renewal sticker

147
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,920
tells us which year the episode is set in. This does make things a little awkward at times,

148
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,520
as the timeline, particularly because of episodes with holidays, doesn't always line up. By honing

149
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,040
in on each year, we can split the series up into four distinctive eras. And as we follow the lives

150
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,320
of these characters, we'll see how the series gradually evolves. That 70s show spends only a

151
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,240
brief stretch in 1976. In fact, only the first 12 episodes of the series take place in that year,

152
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,880
before we move on to 1977 for the second half of the first season. One exception is Episode 23 of

153
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,160
Season 1, which also takes place in 1976, in part because the order of the episodes was

154
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,360
shuffled around while airing. This creates a few instances of confusing continuity, like Eric

155
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,880
mentioning he and Hyde hadn't yet sprayed the water tower when we had seen them do just that

156
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,720
in the episode that aired the previous week. In addition to Eric and Donna's love affair,

157
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,840
one of the big overarching themes in these early episodes is the precarious economic spot of the

158
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,960
I've noticed that the pop selection has really went downhill since your dad got laid off.

159
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:56,560
He's not laid off. He's just part-time. And shut up. When the president comes to visit point

160
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,720
place, Red is selected to ask the president a question. When he's given a question,

161
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,800
rather than being allowed to ask his own, Red gets frustrated. A man has to stand up and be heard.

162
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,720
I will not sit quietly by while everything is taken away from me.

163
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,760
They took my job, my stability, and now they want to take away my right of free speech.

164
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,360
You still have the Toyota, it gets great mileage.

165
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,720
It being 1976, the president right now is Gerald Ford, who assumed office after Richard Nixon

166
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,200
resigned. This is why Nixon was on the cusp of being impeached and removed from office.

167
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,720
What Red is feeling here is not just the indifference towards him from the federal

168
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,440
government, but the general sense that America is leaving him behind, and that the country is

169
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,560
corrupt from top to bottom, letting him lose his job as he's lost in the shuffle of the marketplace.

170
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,800
What Red doesn't realize is the America he thought he knew as a boy wasn't a whole lot better,

171
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:01,680
or at least not as free as he imagined it was. It's not so much that the country has changed,

172
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,240
as he just happens to be one of the people it's left behind. And the show doesn't make it such

173
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,360
a big secret here that the problem lies much with a business class that uses people like Red as pawns.

174
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,320
Bob, a member of the local community of businessmen, represents that world when he thinks of Red to

175
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,440
ask the president a question. The important thing is to choose the right person. You know,

176
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:26,720
a working class guy, your average Joe. I guess someone you and I would call a loser.

177
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,160
So, of course, I thought of you.

178
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,920
Although Red planned to go off script at the presidential event,

179
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,880
at first he seems a bit too nervous to ask any question at all. But after Erica makes

180
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,960
a rash political protest by streaking the president, Red finds his nerve.

181
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,600
Hey, Jerry. Here's my question. How the hell could you pardon Nixon?

182
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:59,120
Sometimes a man's gotta do what he thinks is right.

183
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:05,280
These early episodes probably have Red at his most relatable, perhaps because of the economic

184
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,280
insecurity that people are feeling in the present day, and something that people in the 90s might

185
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,240
have felt as well when this show was first airing. And back then, it was when a booming economy was

186
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,240
raising questions about who the economy is exactly booming for. One of the early plot lines, just to

187
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,800
get the obvious out of the way, was having the gang go disco dancing. One part of this

188
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:36,960
episode has Fez noticing one of the disco's inspirations. And Fez is revealed to be a fantastic

189
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:41,760
dancer. Although Fez is a mystery throughout the series, it's early on when he's at his best.

190
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,240
He seems like he's genuinely from somewhere, with a history and culture that only seems

191
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,960
especially foreign in contrast to the relative ignorance of the largely white small town in

192
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,200
middle America. There's something sweet seen Fez struggling to understand American culture,

193
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,960
and it offers members of the audience less familiar with 70s culture the chance to have

194
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:21,440
it explained to them in a less heavy-handed way. There will be much more to say about Fez as the

195
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,000
series progresses, but over time this innocence would vanish, and we'd be left with another

196
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:38,000
early trait he showed in these episodes, being a bit of a creep. The early episodes of That 70

197
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,080
Show also featured a landmark moment in TV history. In the episode, Eric's Buddy, We Meet Buddy,

198
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,200
played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Eric's lab partner and one of the most popular kids in school.

199
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,240
As their friendship grows, so does a misunderstanding, at least in Buddy's mind.

200
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,480
And I feel like I'm playing this part, right? But it's not me.

201
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:13,280
This is the first kiss between two men on network TV. Although sometimes that's credited to the

202
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,240
Dawson's Creek episode True Love, Eric's Buddy beat its air by about five months.

203
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,480
Eric being straight has to turn Buddy down, but the two agree to stay friends.

204
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,840
If you don't want to be my lab partner anymore, then I'll understand.

205
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:35,520
No, no. Oh, I didn't mean it like that. Um, look, we're still friends. Really? Yeah.

206
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,840
And as the rules of sitcoms go, with a one-off guest star destined to be a one-off guest star,

207
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,960
we never see Buddy again. At the time, this moment was heralded as a very positive depiction of a

208
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,600
gay character. Buddy is cool, popular, and charming, not at all living up to any of the

209
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,240
stereotypes of gay characters you might see on other shows, including this one in later seasons.

210
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,280
The episode was even nominated for a GLAAD Award as an outstanding TV individual episode.

211
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,200
What's probably most notable about this moment is the audience's reaction, though,

212
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,040
which is genuine shock from something they likely hadn't seen on a TV show before.

213
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:13,200
Looking at it 20 years later, it seems almost tame compared to modern television,

214
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,600
and it's a little disappointing to see Buddy play the token gay character who's there and gone now

215
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:22,400
that the gay episode has been handled. It does reveal how little representation there was for

216
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,360
gay characters on TV at this time, and perhaps what makes it age less gracefully is that it was on

217
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,080
the cusp of a growing change in television, which would see an increase in the number of gay

218
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,960
characters on sitcoms. Buddy wasn't even the first character to appear on the series, as the pilot

219
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,000
featured a gay couple, one of whom was a mechanic who traded a car part for concert tickets to the

220
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:55,760
gang. Aside from these brief moments, the romance on the show was overwhelmingly heterosexual,

221
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,240
and one of the top concerns for its characters. Jackie and Kelso, being the established couple

222
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,880
in the beginning, struggle to stay together. Or rather, Kelso is constantly trying to convince

223
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:17,760
his friends he's about to dump his very annoying girlfriend. Knowing that Mila Kunis is only 15

224
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,320
throughout season 1 does make a few of the scenes a bit uncomfortable to watch, though because of

225
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,960
the age difference between her and Ashton Kutcher, who was 20 at the time, most of the scenes where

226
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:31,600
they're making out happen hidden behind car seats and other obstacles. Kelso's attraction

227
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,720
to Lori in particular reveals he's not entirely committed to Jackie, and while Lori is no stranger

228
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:53,760
to hooking up, Kelso's chances largely only exist in his head. Of course, the biggest romantic

229
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:58,640
plotline in the early episodes is the Eric and Donna relationship. It's immediately obvious from

230
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,720
the first episode that these two would be getting together, so a bit of intrigue is thrown into the

231
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:07,440
middle of it, with Hyde attempting to create a love triangle. A few flirtations from Hyde

232
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,160
doesn't really do much to interrupt Eric and Donna getting closer, often in the most embarrassing

233
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:31,280
way possible. As the year comes to an end, Eric and his friends hold their own Christmas party.

234
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,400
It's about as close as Hyde gets to winning Donna's affections.

235
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:57,680
Even with this magical Christmas, Eric and Donna still seem like the couple destined to be together,

236
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:01,840
and by the time Valentine's Day rolls around next year, this subplot is put to bed,

237
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,640
with Hyde backing off after being rejected by Donna.

238
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:31,440
Throughout 1976, the innocence of the series is apparent, with Brad losing a kind of innocence

239
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,480
when he learns that America isn't the land of dreams he once imagined. Through Fez's ignorance

240
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:41,600
of his new homeland, in Eric and the gang learning about gay people, and Eric and Donna discovering

241
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,240
their first love. The world is becoming a more complicated place, and the idealized version of

242
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,800
the world these characters imagined is fading away. This is a common theme in most coming-of-age

243
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,120
stories, but it feels even more prominent on that 70s show, because we in the audience have the

244
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:00,160
advantage of knowing a future that these characters don't. We may not know what happens in our future,

245
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,520
but we know at least some of the major events that will happen in theirs.

246
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,720
And their ignorance of those facts helps make the impression of innocence even more pronounced.

247
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,840
Once Hyde stepped aside from the Eric and Donna pairing, it gave his character the

248
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:30,960
chance to grow into something more interesting. In the season 1 episode Career Day, we meet Hyde's

249
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,320
mother Edna, played by Katie Seagal. She works as the school's lunch lady, and she has a troubled

250
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,360
relationship with Hyde.

251
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,880
This is sadly the last we see of Hyde's mother Edna, though he would have a number

252
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,280
of father figures throughout the years, including Red. In the episode Punk Chick,

253
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,840
when Hyde falls for Chrissy, played by Jade Gordon, he's tempted to follow her to New York,

254
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
where she plans to start a punk band.

255
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,880
Red and Kitty try to convince Hyde not to run off to New York.

256
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,920
And so does Eric.

257
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:23,760
Hyde eventually decides to stay in point place.

258
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,720
Although it's never made clear whose advice convinced Hyde to stay,

259
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,960
we do learn that what Hyde is missing most in his life is the good influence of the Foreman

260
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,160
household. Something that becomes essential when Edna runs off with a trucker at the end of season

261
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,000
1, leaving Hyde without a home.

262
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,120
Even though Edna's not coming back, Hyde rejects help at first.

263
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,040
But Eric goes to his parents, who are struggling to afford the kids they already have.

264
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:12,720
Ultimately, it's Red who has to step up and make the decision to help Hyde,

265
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,240
with some encouragement from Kitty.

266
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:40,240
And Hyde quickly makes himself the model son in the Foreman household.

267
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,400
What this consistently reinforces is that Hyde needs a stable family life,

268
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:02,640
and in particular a father figure like Red to keep him on the straight and narrow path.

269
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,240
It's a very old-fashioned message. A young boy needs a father figure.

270
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,240
In the second season, Hyde even gets a second quasi-father figure in Leo,

271
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,720
played by Tommy Chong, who gives Hyde a job.

272
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:38,720
The money goes towards the noble goal of supporting the Foreman household.

273
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:55,520
Hyde is the model wayward child, taken under the wing of a strong father who sets him on the right

274
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,480
path, and by season 2 he's slowly transforming into a respectable member of society. It's a sort

275
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:05,120
of arc you might see in a family drama from the 70s, though thankfully that 70s show doesn't fit

276
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:10,240
so neatly into that sentimental cliché. In the season 2 finale, moon over point place,

277
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,920
Jackie is busted for holding marijuana, and Hyde takes the fall for her.

278
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:25,920
And then Red finds out.

279
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:36,400
Red threatens to kick Hyde out, but Jackie eventually takes responsibility for what

280
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,880
happened, and Hyde is allowed to stay in the Foreman household. Hyde was on a promising path,

281
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:45,280
but to save Jackie, he throws himself in harm's way. What's particularly interesting is how he

282
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:50,560
does it, though. He calls himself a dirtbag, and in some ways Hyde still sees himself like that,

283
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:54,480
in spite of all of the work he's done on improving while living with the Foreman's.

284
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,240
The Foreman's can take him in and give him a home and give structure to his life,

285
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,600
but in his heart he still sees himself as an outsider. Hyde is a strong representative for

286
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:10,160
1977, because if 1976 was about the loss of innocence, 1977 is about finding this new

287
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:15,120
sense of home in a strange new world. Only Hyde has felt that way through most of his life.

288
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,880
As much as he had hoped his mother would pull herself together and be a better parent,

289
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,360
going so far as to be the bigger person and apologize first when they fight, he ultimately

290
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,120
can't get her to be the mother he needs, and when the Foreman's offer him a new home,

291
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,600
he can't see himself as a part of it. At least, not right away. The show's answer,

292
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,400
at least in this year, takes the shape of Bud, Hyde's father, played by Robert Hayes.

293
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,440
He returns to point place, and after he's discovered by Hyde,

294
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,840
tries to make amends for abandoning his son.

295
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:49,040
Bud, you're doing great now, huh? Color TV? I remember when I was a kid, I didn't even have

296
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:53,840
a father. I got no excuse. I was a jerk. I've been a jerk my whole life.

297
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,720
And all I can do is tell you I'm sorry and hope that you'll believe me.

298
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,680
But even if this seems like recreating the childhood he lost, there are hints that this won't last

299
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:34,720
either. There is this strange episode where Red tries to teach Bud how to be a better father.

300
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:40,640
Steven doesn't need another friend, Bud. Steven needs somebody to ride his ass.

301
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,320
It seems as though the answer to Hyde's feeling of alienation is… more strict fathering,

302
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,360
from a blood relation this time. But as we'll see in later years, Hyde's life is not so easily

303
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,680
fixed with that, and his rebellious streak isn't something that needs to be disciplined out of him,

304
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:59,600
but rather channeled into something more productive, such as protecting a friend,

305
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:05,920
the way he stood up for Jackie. Jackie and Kelso had had something of a rocky year in 1977. In the

306
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:11,360
very first episode of that year, Season 1's ski trip, Jackie breaks up with Kelso after finding

307
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,360
out he was making out with Pam Macy. They get back together by the end of the episode, though,

308
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:20,400
but this would establish a pattern. Four episodes later, in the episode titled The Pill,

309
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:25,440
Jackie has a pregnancy scare. After Kelso melts down in response, they break up again.

310
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,920
Only to get back together in the episode, Prom Night.

311
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,800
In Season 2, their relationship is tested once again with Eric's sister Lori becoming a part

312
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,320
of the main cast. She takes an interest in Kelso and his new van.

313
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:56,800
This isn't Lori falling for Kelso, though. It's something a bit more basic than that.

314
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:10,320
Much of the season then focuses on Kelso trying to balance

315
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,280
dating Jackie with cheating on her with Lori.

316
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:26,560
While Kelso was clearly the bad guy in all of this, he might be mistaken as being a hapless

317
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,600
fool being used by Lori. Eventually, the truth comes out in Kiss of Death. Kelso has finally

318
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:36,400
realized that the genuine love of Jackie means more to him than the lust represented by Lori,

319
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:56,400
and he decides to break things off with her. While Lori is

320
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:01,760
always insufferable, it's pretty clear that this is, and has always been, Kelso's fault.

321
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:06,320
More than just being a fool, he actively hurt Jackie, and when she ends things with him,

322
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,920
it looks like it will be sticking around for longer than an episode or two this time.

323
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:26,880
And so ends the show's first relationship.

324
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:56,720
Jackie seemed like a challenging person to date, but it doesn't excuse what Kelso did to her,

325
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,640
and with naive Kelso being the more affable character in the affair, it's interesting

326
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,200
that he was the bad guy in the whole thing. Often in stories of an infidelity, characters are more

327
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,680
helpfully coded as heroes or villains of the story, but especially for a sitcom, the dynamic

328
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,600
here is surprisingly not straightforward. It shows us how trust is broken by deeds rather than persona,

329
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,880
and that someone's personality doesn't always tell you who they are as a person. At least, not

330
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,000
entirely. Although it took many twists and turns to get here, Jackie and Kelso both get the chance

331
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,960
to grow beyond the high school romance they had. Jackie moves on to other romantic interests,

332
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:36,240
as the show teases her possibly dating Hyde or Fez, while Kelso tries to date Lori for real.

333
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:40,960
This leads to some classic confrontations between the two ladies in the Foreman basement.

334
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,040
Eventually, and completely unsurprisingly, Lori cheats on Kelso,

335
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,240
and he apologizes to Jackie.

336
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:42,800
Kelso's apology is pretty good, and in time he realizes that the only woman he wants to be with

337
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:48,480
is Jackie. Jackie still might be interested in him, so she tests Kelso to see if he's truly changed.

338
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:06,880
And we're back where we started. Albeit with Kelso seeming to have grown up a little, and Jackie

339
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:11,520
deciding to forgive him again. Although it's nice enough for Kelso to have become a more mature

340
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:15,760
character, it does reveal that the show wasn't entirely sure how to evolve Jackie. While her

341
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,680
being a year younger than everyone else in the gang, and two years younger than Kelso who is held

342
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,400
back a grade, it still seems odd that she's only been able to identify herself based on whether or

343
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:29,600
not she's dating someone. She's of course rich and popular, but after the first season, these

344
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,080
aspects of her character seem less important, as neither are quite as relevant when she's hanging

345
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:38,400
out with the other characters. Aside from being fodder for a few jokes here and there. Much in

346
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,040
the same way Hyde's answer to the alienation he felt was to end up back with his father, Jackie and

347
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:48,080
Kelso respond to their separation in the same way. Fear of the new normal certainly makes sense, and

348
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:52,880
it reveals that perhaps these teens aren't quite ready to step into adulthood just yet. They've

349
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:57,120
still got some growing to do. Another reason Jackie and Kelso may have been put together is because

350
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:02,240
Lisa Robin Kelly, who played Laurie on the show, exited the series in season 3. Although her

351
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,280
character was adding a lot to the show, the actress was having personal issues behind the scenes. In

352
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:12,080
an interview with ABC in 2012, she described having had a miscarriage at the time and then falling

353
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:16,320
into alcoholism. Although she would briefly return in season 5 for four more episodes,

354
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,560
Laurie would eventually be recast, with Christina Marr taking over the part.

355
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,560
Eric and Donna's relationship becomes official in the second half of season 1,

356
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:28,080
with the first step being Eric giving Donna his class ring.

357
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,960
And in season 2, they finally say they love each other.

358
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,880
Well, Eric says it eventually.

359
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:54,400
And after nearly two seasons, the two of them finally do it in the episode, the first time.

360
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,360
Eric and Donna have largely made the journey comfortably, and 1977 is probably their best

361
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:03,520
year as a couple. They handle most challenges that come their way pretty well, with my favorite being

362
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,640
the episode, Eric's Panties, where Donna finds a mysterious pair of panties in the backseat of

363
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,280
the Vista Cruiser. She assumes they belong to Shelly, a girl who had been flirting with Eric,

364
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,960
played by Mamet Patterson.

365
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,440
Even with things mostly going well for the two, the third season's episode,

366
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:47,280
Baby Fever, did give us a hint that Eric and Donna might not have the happy ending they imagined.

367
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,840
And the comfort Donna gets from Midge has an ominous undertone.

368
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:27,040
One interesting part of why Donna and Eric clash is that Donna wants more for herself

369
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,600
than to be a housewife, unlike what happened to her mother, whereas Eric is modeling his future

370
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:35,840
on what he sees with his parents. One of the keys to understand Donna and Eric's mindsets

371
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:40,000
is to look at what their parents were going through in the same year. In 1976, Red was

372
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:44,240
struggling to put food on the table as his hours were reduced at the auto plant. In a special

373
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,880
Star Wars themed episode called A New Hope, we find out that the plant is going to be shut down

374
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:53,760
for good, leaving Red without a job. This leaves the Foreman's in a rough spot.

375
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:21,040
While it seems dire, Red gets an opportunity to turn things around when a Price Mart opens up in

376
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:32,800
town. On the other side of the property line, Bob is threatened by the arrival of Price Mart.

377
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:43,280
While Red may not seem like the best of friends to Bob, his reasons for going after that job

378
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:57,040
make a lot of sense, as his family heads closer to going broke. For Bob though, Price Mart is the

379
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:07,440
beginning of the end of his appliance store, and it goes under in season 3. Red throughout his life

380
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:12,560
is at the mercy of the big businesses that come and go through point place. When the auto industry

381
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,680
started outsourcing abroad for its parts, his plant got shut down and he was out of work. But

382
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:22,320
when a big box retail store opens up, he suddenly has a job again. There isn't much room for him to

383
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,680
decide where his life will go. At first it seems as though Bob is the wiser person, investing in

384
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:32,400
his own business and providing comfortably for his family, until a big business comes in and turns it

385
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,040
all upside down, leaving him without a job. Bob isn't quite the master of his destiny that he

386
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:41,680
imagined, and even though he was a big wheel in the business community in point place, there are

387
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,960
always bigger fish outside that very little pond. When we look at Eric and Donna, we can see their

388
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,520
parents' outlooks reflected in their own lives. Eric has a more traditional conservative vision

389
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:56,080
for his future because the system seems to be keeping his family afloat. Even if times can get

390
00:43:56,080 --> 00:44:01,680
tough, eventually it all works out. For Donna, her father's failure reflects a system that shows how

391
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:06,320
a bigger force can wipe you away in an instant. This is compounded by Eric growing up as a boy

392
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:12,080
and Donna as a girl. Eric is comforted in the idea that society has been built for someone like him,

393
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:17,200
and challenges are temporary roadblocks. Whereas Donna knows she has an uphill battle. When luck

394
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,520
turns against Bob, she's reminded of a system that doesn't work for her, but rather only values

395
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:25,520
her as a commodity. And when she looks at her mother, she sees someone who's opportunity at

396
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,920
being something other than a housewife taken from her because she happened to get pregnant at a young

397
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,200
age. So Eric assuming he and Donna will just get married and settled down, while Donna dreams of

398
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,240
something more, explain why there might be some confusion on where the relationship is headed.

399
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,200
The irony for Eric is that he's wrong to have any faith in the system. Red getting a job at

400
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,640
Price Smart, saving their family from financial peril, is pure luck. To be fair, Red had originally

401
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,680
been offered a job as a cashier, and then insisted on a management position. But even with the benefit

402
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:00,720
of his hard head, that opportunity would be nothing if Price Smart hadn't chosen to open up a store

403
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,160
in point place. But Eric does have the opportunity to learn better, and that comes in the shape of

404
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,040
his mother Kitty. Kitty works as a nurse at a nearby hospital, a job she took on to help the

405
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,920
family with her finances. When Eric goes to the hospital with Kitty for career day, he learns just

406
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:21,040
how capable she is. You know, your mom does the work of five nurses. This place would fall apart

407
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:28,240
without her. And she's so funny. Oh yeah, she is. Um, wait, no, she's not. And even more than that,

408
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:33,200
Eric learns about one of the real challenges of working at a hospital. I mean, for Mr. Anderson,

409
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,400
but you knew this guy, mom. How do you deal with all of this?

410
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:54,560
While Eric and his mother would bond as the seasons went on, Kitty never quite becomes the

411
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:59,280
force in the foreman household that Red is. If her job as a nurse symbolizes her strength,

412
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,920
it's telling that she seems to quit and go back throughout the series, which reflects an

413
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:10,080
insecurity in her status. That insecure status manifests in Eric, who has a less than perfect

414
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,120
understanding that Donna wants to be more than a homemaker. Eric assumes his mother is happiest at

415
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:21,120
home, when we'll see in later seasons that isn't really the case. For Donna, her faith in relationships

416
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:25,760
is also reflected in how her parents seem to be falling apart in theirs. As Midge empowers herself

417
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,480
through attempting to understand feminist theory, Bob grows worried that it may make her want to

418
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:36,160
start becoming a radical and do something crazy, like get a job. Well, I'm the man of the house,

419
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:42,720
and I say you're not going to community college. You can't tell me what to do, you big ass.

420
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,520
Midge's interest in feminism is a bit fleeting, though, as she and Bob seem to drift with

421
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:53,280
every fad that comes their way, from fondue to nudism.

422
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:57,360
They used to be normal. What the hell happened to them?

423
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
Well, I don't know. How can she not eat meats? That can't be healthy.

424
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:06,960
And over time, we find out that Bob and Midge just aren't happy together.

425
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,800
Donna, your mother was fine until she met those feminists and started thinking.

426
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,080
Well, excuse me, Bob, but I'm not happy.

427
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:20,640
With her parents constantly fighting, the last thing Donna wants to create is a mere image of

428
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:24,880
them with Eric. And without that positive role model for a happy relationship, she wants to

429
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:29,200
create something new and different. Although feminism was a passing interest for Midge,

430
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,480
it seems to have had a stronger impact on Donna. Hyde, Red, Jackie, and Kelso all respond to the

431
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:40,400
changes of 1977 with a return to the familiar. For Hyde, it's a chance to have a father again.

432
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,800
For Red, it's back to working as management in the corporate machine. For Jackie and Kelso,

433
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,000
it's giving their troubled relationship another chance. But for Bob, he can't go back to running

434
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:54,320
a store again, and he and Midge aren't returning to the happy marriage they once had. So Eric and

435
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,040
Donna have to ask themselves where they are in this year of change, going down the familiar

436
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,560
path of Eric's parents, or finding something completely new.

437
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,000
1978 brought with it some major changes to the show. Eric is slowly realizing the relationship

438
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,760
he has isn't like the one his mom and dad have. Eric tries to escalate his relationship with Donna

439
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,120
by giving her a promise ring in the season 3 finale. As Donna considers the meaning of this

440
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:29,200
promise ring, she realizes she's not ready for the commitment it represents. So she gives it back to Eric.

441
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,560
The important thing is when you see yourself in Paris, or wherever, I'm there, right?

442
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:50,960
Right? I don't know. Not always. We're together now. Isn't that enough? No! I mean...

443
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:57,360
I mean damn, Donna! If you can see a future for yourself without me,

444
00:48:57,360 --> 00:49:00,880
and that doesn't like break your heart, then we're not doing what I thought we were doing here,

445
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,120
and you know what? Maybe we shouldn't even be together at all. Are you breaking up with me?

446
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,040
Well, are you getting back that ring?

447
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:13,920
That's... Then...

448
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:25,280
Yes. It's ironically not the present that breaks up Eric and Donna, but the future,

449
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,400
and their different visions for it. Donna wants to see where life will take her, and Eric wants

450
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,000
to start building a life he already imagines. And ironically, they end up heading into a direction

451
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:41,120
neither of them wanted. After the breakup, Eric is left shattered in a way that anyone who's

452
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:46,640
gone through their first breakup can probably relate to. Geez, huh? You look like you've just

453
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:54,000
been dumped! Later on, Red actually offers some good advice. Listen, I'm gonna give you a few

454
00:49:54,000 --> 00:50:03,360
days to pull yourself together. You can stand bad and sleep, watch TV, whatever you need to do.

455
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:11,680
Thank you, Dad. The fallout of Donna and Eric's split would play out over several episodes,

456
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,960
with the two of them learning how to live among one another after some really nasty post-breakup

457
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:22,160
feelings. But this moment where Eric and Red bond is surprisingly sweet, and in many ways

458
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:26,800
emblematic of how the two have been growing increasingly close over the previous seasons.

459
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,920
Sometimes it took the shape of Eric standing up to Red.

460
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:33,040
Now you screwed yourself when you didn't return those books! Now go!

461
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,160
Okay. No.

462
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,400
Sometimes the bonding happened on a hunting trip.

463
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,160
I think you're angry, because life didn't turn out exactly the way you wanted it to.

464
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,400
And, uh, maybe you think if you yell at me, I won't let life push me around, too.

465
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:57,840
You came up with that answer awful fast.

466
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,440
Eric and Red's relationship is built on Eric's rebellion while understanding who his father is,

467
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,600
and Red trying to make Eric who he thinks Eric needs to be. By reconciling all of these things,

468
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:16,720
Eric is able to grow himself. Red is both a role model and cautionary tale for Eric,

469
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:22,080
and he takes the lesson to heart. But Red is also a father to him that offers comfort and love when

470
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,480
he needs it the most, like in that moment after his breakup with Donna. But there is something

471
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,520
in the relationship that's shaped by the less enlightened era Red comes from, where emotions

472
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,400
aren't so easily shared, such as when Red lies about crying after being dumped.

473
00:51:36,400 --> 00:52:05,200
It's a major event when Red tells Eric he loves him.

474
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:15,760
I'm sorry, what?

475
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,280
When Kitty finds out Red was hopped up on medication,

476
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,200
she tries to stop Eric from returning the gesture.

477
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:40,640
Go to your room.

478
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,320
Red tries to explain the rules around saying I love you for men.

479
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:49,200
When he's drunk, when he's dying,

480
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,480
or when he's in big trouble and it's the only way out.

481
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,400
Other than that.

482
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,600
Other than that, it's just a given.

483
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:03,520
While the idea that love is simply understood is nice, but it's clear from the rest of this episode

484
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:08,240
that everyone understands that saying it out loud means something too, something more than that

485
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:13,760
implicit understanding offers. That outward expression of emotion is not something Red can

486
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:19,040
offer Eric. The relationship of a cold father to an emotionally needy son is an old trope,

487
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:24,080
and by setting it in the 70s, maybe it seems more acceptable. But being a show from the 90s,

488
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,800
it was aware of how limited this relationship could be, and watching 20 years on, it becomes

489
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,800
more apparent. Fathers and sons should be able to say they love one another without

490
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:37,120
slamming face first into this cliché of what masculinity should be.

491
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:41,600
There's still a lot of positives between Eric and Red, but something as simple as them being

492
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:46,080
open with their feelings is a sad limit for what could have been a more meaningful relationship.

493
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,880
1978 brought with it the departure of Mitch. Growing so frustrated with her marriage to Bob,

494
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:52,720
she takes off for California.

495
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:55,920
I can't believe she would just take off without even a hint or a warning.

496
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,560
No warning? Dad, she was always saying I'm unhappy and I'm gonna leave.

497
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,280
I mean, that's just what married people say.

498
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,080
Donna luckily has kitty to be there for her as a mother figure.

499
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,880
But it's been so nice having someone to talk to since my mom left.

500
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,920
I know. Someone who understands what I'm going through.

501
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:21,520
Behind the scenes, the reason Tanya Roberts loved the show was to care for her husband,

502
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,920
who had become terminally ill. Roberts would appear in later seasons in a handful of guest

503
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:31,040
spots. We don't get nearly as much insight into how Donna handles the breakup, since the show

504
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,080
focuses on Eric. But it's interesting that both of them turn to his parents for help getting

505
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:40,160
through it, and the comfort they offer in some ways reinforces the idea of a happy ending in the

506
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:44,880
future, that one day they'll find someone they won't break up with. They both try dating other

507
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:50,000
people, with Donna dating Kelso's brother Casey, played by Luke Wilson. And Eric dates a few other

508
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:55,120
girls, sometimes sneaking off with Red's new Corvette to attract them. None of these girls

509
00:54:55,120 --> 00:55:00,080
last long, and while Donna continues to date Kelso, Eric realizes he's still in love with her.

510
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:06,720
And now, Donna, all of a sudden, it's like the day after we broke up. All over again.

511
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:11,360
Casey is revealed to just be toying with Donna, leaving her heartbroken. So she runs off to

512
00:55:11,360 --> 00:55:16,560
California to be with Midge at the end of season 4. In the season 5 premiere, Eric goes to California

513
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:24,880
to get her back. I love you. And I have so much to say, but I just... And a few episodes later,

514
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,480
Eric and Donna get engaged. And the rest of season 5 largely see these two trying to win

515
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:35,440
approval from everybody else for their decision to get married in their final year of high school.

516
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:40,720
It's a very strange series of events when, in the space of roughly half a year, we go from

517
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:45,680
Donna and Eric breaking up to getting engaged. In terms of real-world time, this played out on

518
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,240
television over roughly a year and a half, which seems more reasonable, but the sheer volume of

519
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,920
episodes crammed into each show's annual time span creates a real decompression of time. This

520
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:00,080
can be understood as time feeling much longer when you're younger, and your teenage years

521
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,880
seeming so grand and important that everything can change in the course of a few days or weeks.

522
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:09,520
And two people can go from not knowing what their future might hold to knowing they'll be together

523
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:14,960
forever over the course of a few months. It also reinforces how quickly Eric and Donna are growing.

524
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,880
They manage to gain a lot of maturity in their time apart, and through the process of trying

525
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,520
to convince everyone that their engagement is a good idea, we see what feels like the ultimate

526
00:56:23,520 --> 00:56:29,120
conclusion of the Eric and Red dynamic. As a disapproving Red throws numerous roadblocks to

527
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:34,080
stop the wedding from happening, Eric refuses to back down, and Red has one final confrontation

528
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:40,480
with him. You're stuck to your guns, and I admire that you're willing to go out on your own.

529
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:52,720
Eric is now a man. And ironically, it wasn't by obeying Red that he got there,

530
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:57,440
but by rebelling against him. And also by emulating him. Because Red Foreman is not

531
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:03,040
a man who backs down, and now, neither is Eric. It's a bit strange how this relationship stopped

532
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:08,560
being about Eric and Donna and gradually became more about Eric and Red. Eric's path to adulthood

533
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:13,120
meant he has to move beyond his father and grow into something better. It's an uplifting message

534
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:18,960
that reveals that Red can be a role model, but can't be a limit on who Eric can be. And Eric manages

535
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,800
to make it to adulthood, not losing that sweeter, kinder, gentler side of himself. Donna's dreams

536
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:29,040
of doing more outside of Point Place don't seem to come up as much in these episodes, and she

537
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:33,200
doesn't think the marriage will somehow hinder that. The loss of Eric, her mother, and being

538
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:38,160
messed with Casey has dropped her back into the arms of Eric, holding on to what certainty she

539
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,760
can find in life. In some ways, this reflects the limited options of women of the era. If Donna

540
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,880
represented this bold new feminist force ready to take on the world, a few bad turns are all it

541
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,520
takes to leave her ready to move into a trailer and begin living the domestic life. Although she

542
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:59,600
and Eric plan on going to college together, when Eric's plans change, so do hers and she stays in

543
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,160
Point Place. Comparing her and Eric, it seems Eric has the brighter future with the path to happiness

544
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:08,960
he wants right there for him when he's ready to take it. Donna has to compromise for him.

545
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:13,760
But all of this started happening in season 5 is important because that seemed like the season

546
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:19,040
where the show became more cynical and less thoughtful in its depiction of its characters.

547
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:25,120
Season 5, which starts in the summer of 1978, has a strange feel to it. The characters seem to behave

548
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:31,040
in a more exaggerated way. Red has always been mean to all of Eric's friends, Fez included, but

549
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:36,400
he seems nastier to him starting in this season, often drifting into outright racism.

550
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,040
Thanks for the help. You seem to have a natural talent for handling luggage.

551
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:46,240
And speaking of comments like that, we'll see characters casually drop in gross stuff

552
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,160
like this in random conversations. I'm starting to get into the Asian ladies.

553
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,560
I know what you mean. The mystery of the Orient. I'm very sexy.

554
00:58:55,840 --> 00:59:00,720
Characters seem to bit flatter too. Eric, for example, started becoming far more nerdy in

555
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:05,280
this season. In season 1, we found out he really enjoyed Star Wars. But in the following three

556
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:11,040
seasons, it never really comes up. But starting in season 5, he's suddenly collecting action

557
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:15,840
figures and getting very upset when Red makes a homophobic comment about Luke Skywalker.

558
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:20,880
Luke Skywalker, this Luke Skywalker, that I'm sick of hearing about that little fruit.

559
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:31,520
Luke Skywalker is not! He and Leia, clearly!

560
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,960
Eric was never particularly cool, but he also wasn't so aggressively nerdy. By the way,

561
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:44,480
the future has some bad news for Eric about the Luke and Leia thing. Red becomes increasingly

562
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:48,640
patriotic in this season, even for some reason becoming a Nixon defender.

563
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:50,640
Thank God for the honest ones like Richard Nixon, huh?

564
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,120
What did you say?

565
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:03,360
I said that Nixon was framed and Kennedy was a commie?

566
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:06,000
That's right.

567
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:12,160
While Red always had a degree of patriotism in him, this is a far cry from the Red Forman

568
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:18,160
who confronted Gerald Ford about pardoning Nixon. Red's patriotism is now more of a cliche.

569
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:23,280
The biggest change in season 5 though is with Kitty, when she mistakenly thinks she's pregnant

570
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,800
but is actually going through menopause. She reveals this in front of her parents,

571
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:38,960
played by Betty White and Tom Poston. This major moment in her life might have led to her character

572
01:00:38,960 --> 01:00:44,080
growing beyond motherhood and evolving to someone different. And while we do see some nice moments

573
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:50,160
between her and her parents, what we get far more of in season 5 are a series of bad menopause jokes.

574
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:02,240
Season 5 flattened its characters into cliches, making the dynamics less compelling than they

575
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:06,960
were in earlier seasons. Part of this is that the show's premise is literally trapping them

576
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,200
in this decade, meaning these characters are limited in the way they can grow or change.

577
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:16,400
If they have to forever be teens, it doesn't really offer the opportunity to truly become

578
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:21,360
adults. Not every change in season 5 was a bad one though, as it did also include the introduction

579
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:30,960
of Kitty's new dog, Shotzi. Shotzi even joins a very special circle.

580
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:43,920
At the beginning of season 4, Hyde is back living with the Four Men's.

581
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:18,800
When Jackie pressures Kelso to get married, he runs away to California with Donna,

582
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:22,640
finally ending his relationship with Jackie for good. With Kelso gone,

583
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,080
Jackie goes into season 5 in a very different direction.

584
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:37,760
This comes out of nowhere in the series, but there were a few hints leading up to this moment.

585
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,880
As you saw earlier, Hyde took the fall for Jackie's pop possession,

586
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:45,600
and between one of Jackie and Kelso's breakup, Hyde realizes he might have some feelings for her.

587
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,160
But it doesn't get too much further than a kiss.

588
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,880
A season and a half later, the two of them are exploring those old feelings for real.

589
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:13,600
Although a new development, the spark for their relationship isn't terribly inspired.

590
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:32,320
But it does offer a few nice moments that speak to their history,

591
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:36,720
like Jackie taking the fall for Hyde's pop possession. But when Jackie reveals she still

592
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,720
has some kind of attachment to Kelso, it puts a strain on her relationship with Hyde.

593
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:51,040
Although they smooth things over, Hyde's concerns get the better of him when he thinks

594
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:55,520
he's caught Jackie and Kelso being intimate when she was really comforting him after Fez

595
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:00,160
had an erotic dream about Kelso. Hyde responds by cheating on Jackie.

596
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:04,240
When the truth comes out, Hyde is left apologizing, and Jackie breaks things off.

597
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,000
They get back together early in season six.

598
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:32,160
If you note that when Jackie and Hyde got together, it was the summer of 1978. And now

599
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,760
looking at Donna and Jackie enjoying an afternoon run at the pool, it's still the summer of 1978.

600
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:41,360
Not literally, of course. The show has actually gone through an entire season where the gang

601
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:45,920
finished their final year of high school. Yet, for some reason, the license plate still reads

602
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:51,200
1978. The kids of the show are trapped in the 70s and trapped in the show's cyclical storylines,

603
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:55,120
in a sense making a commentary about how shows like these are limited. Instead of its characters

604
01:04:55,120 --> 01:05:00,080
growing over time, they're stuck. Even a show that was primarily designed to be driven by its

605
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:06,080
characters is eventually trapped by its premise. Season 5's trip to California had that 70s show

606
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:11,600
trap its characters in its own version of Hotel California, which, by the way, was originally

607
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:18,080
recorded in 1976, the first year covered in that 70s show. While Hyde continuously tries to escape

608
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:23,200
his circumstances, constantly getting pulled back into where he was before, Jackie's struggle is

609
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:28,800
a bit sadder. She only seems to ever be defined by who she is or who she isn't dating. While her

610
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:34,000
character is very much the vehicle for discussing relationships early on, particularly for Donna,

611
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:37,840
who needs someone to help her make sense of her feelings for Eric, Jackie doesn't get a chance

612
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:43,760
to be much more than the relationship character. Jackie is very much carried by Mila Kunis'

613
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:48,960
performances, who manages to make the character both lovable and obnoxious in near-equal measures.

614
01:05:48,960 --> 01:05:52,560
She's a great part of the series, but the series doesn't do well enough to give her more varied

615
01:05:52,560 --> 01:05:57,600
things to do. One change I haven't mentioned yet is that Tommy Chong joined the principal cast in

616
01:05:57,600 --> 01:06:21,520
season 4 but left the show in season 5. The reason Chong left the show is because he was arrested

617
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:27,440
for selling 7,500 bongs through a company he partially owned. He had to pay a fine of

618
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,480
$20,000 and was sentenced to 9 months in prison, but he would eventually return to the show once

619
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:36,640
he had been let out. Another change we have to talk about is one that had built building for the

620
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:43,440
last few seasons. Fez was starting to get really weird. As the last in the gang to lose his virginity,

621
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,680
one of the running gags for Fez was how his perpetual quest to hook up with someone never

622
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:52,160
seemed to work out. His dating life is a series of amusing fails, with my personal favorite being

623
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:57,600
Caroline, who he briefly dated in season 3. Caroline is not quite as sweet as she first appears.

624
01:07:22,320 --> 01:07:26,640
As you might have guessed, they break up. When Fez isn't failing in the dating world,

625
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:30,160
he is making numerous jokes about how horny he is. And the more he jokes,

626
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:32,880
the more the bar gets raised where what counts as creepy.

627
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:59,520
Fez starts off as a little weird, but as the audience gets used to him, he has to say or do

628
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,240
something strange to remind everyone that he's not like everyone else, raising the bar for what

629
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:09,760
counts as weird. As the cycle repeats, the bar keeps getting raised, but at this point it isn't

630
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:15,360
as shocking because Fez has been building to this level for years. Fez also seems less like he's

631
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:21,440
from a real place anymore. In the early seasons whenever he speaks his native language, he defaults

632
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:45,120
to speaking Spanish. But now we're getting jokes like this. Fez seems more like a cartoon

633
01:08:45,120 --> 01:08:49,520
character than an actual foreign exchange student. Fez's transformations is one of

634
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:54,000
the only ones that felt gradual in season 5 though. Even if the other characters all have some

635
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:59,040
degree of backstory, they still seem noticeably different as the show keeps them frozen in this

636
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:03,280
70s moment, while using a heavy hand to keep this impression that things are still fresh.

637
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:08,720
But Fez was frozen very early on in the series as the series struggled to give him any lasting

638
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:15,440
changes to his character. He was just weird, and he kept getting weirder and, as a consequence,

639
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:21,840
creepier. As season 5 moves along, Lori makes her surprise return. And as Fez is under threat of

640
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:32,960
deportation, having graduated high school, Lori does something drastic. In the season 6 premiere,

641
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:37,840
the kids are alright, we found out that Lori's newly turned over leaf of being a better person

642
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:42,480
immediately turns back over and she returns to being horrible, leaving Fez to be her husband

643
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:55,440
in name only as she dates around. And that's about it. We don't get much more out of this plotline,

644
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:01,360
and Fez continues to putter along. One of the recurring themes for 1978 is how the characters

645
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:06,560
have become frozen. If the previous two years were about discovering a new world, stepping out into it,

646
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:10,960
and then saying maybe that wasn't such a great idea and heading back the way they came,

647
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:16,720
this year was very much about being frozen in place, deciding that where the show needs to be

648
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:23,200
is not in the brave new world of adulthood, but frozen in time in the waning years of the gang's

649
01:10:23,200 --> 01:10:27,600
teenage life. This is part of what makes it difficult for sitcoms to maintain an audience

650
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:32,880
over time. One of the remaining draws is the original situation in the Situation Comedy.

651
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:37,360
That 70s show was always meant to be character driven, which usually helps a sitcom overcome

652
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:41,760
that hurdle. But when those characters aren't allowed to grow, it means they can't drive the

653
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:47,440
series the way they were intended to. Because moving forward requires characters to grow,

654
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:52,240
and that 70s show's very premise means these characters have to stay locked in their teenage

655
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:56,960
years. Five years into the show should mean that Eric and Donna have gone off to college and be

656
01:10:56,960 --> 01:11:01,520
halfway through it, but they're still only just graduating high school. Hyde should be striking

657
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:05,920
out on his own, but he's still learning lessons on growing up from the foreman's. Jackie should

658
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:11,440
be beyond her high school crushes, but she still hasn't even graduated yet. And Fez should be more

659
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:16,480
than this strange foreign exchange student, but none of his arcs ever amount to more than half a

660
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:21,920
season of antics. What this show does do well, though, is preserve the memory of who these people

661
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:26,960
should be. Much in the way it's looked back at the 1970s is preserving the memory of what that

662
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:31,680
decade was in the minds of certain people who experienced it. Maybe that's why this show had

663
01:11:31,680 --> 01:11:35,520
such solid radiance around most of its run, because it was always about holding onto that

664
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,840
nostalgic moment, where you can hang out with your friends from high school and never worry

665
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:44,560
about them growing up and becoming completely different people. If sitcoms are comfort food,

666
01:11:44,560 --> 01:11:53,680
maybe that's the way that 70s show is best memorialized. One of the hallmarks of that 70s

667
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:58,400
show was its frequent use of fantasy cutaways. That included parodies of pop culture from the

668
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:03,520
decade. There were some visual quirks that predated these parodies, though, with season one using

669
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:07,680
tableaus of famous works of art such as The Last Supper and Night Hawks. But it was the Star Wars

670
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:12,160
themed episode, A New Hope, that put characters in special costumes and sets, and really got the

671
01:12:12,160 --> 01:12:17,040
parody ball rolling. From there on, there were dozens of other parodies, from I Love Lucy to

672
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:22,160
Charlie's Angels. I Love Lucy is obviously from the 1950s, not the 70s, but it worked because it

673
01:12:22,160 --> 01:12:26,560
was something these characters were familiar with. And it was a necessity because, as the series

674
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,040
moved along, parodies from the 70s were harder to come by. It would be tough to include every

675
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:36,400
single parody, so here are my top three. The soap opera parody in season two's Van Stock episode

676
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:43,280
was an instant classic for me. I am leaving you for Dr. Cloak. Or should I say...

677
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,280
Eric's real father.

678
01:12:47,280 --> 01:13:01,360
He has a job. What do you have, Red Forman? What do you have?

679
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:07,840
After Red discovers the gang is smoking up, we get a great Reefer Madness parody in the season

680
01:13:07,840 --> 01:13:13,680
three episode titled Reefer Madness. You've been, you missed choir practice. Sorry dollface, but now,

681
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,720
thanks to marijuana, I'm incurably insane.

682
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:26,400
And the Happy Days parody in Jackie Says Cheese is double fun because it also makes a sly reference

683
01:13:26,400 --> 01:13:30,480
to jumping the shark. Fez, you jumped that shark and you're not even wet!

684
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:46,480
One of the biggest changes in 1979 was Hyde learning that his father isn't the man he thought

685
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:50,560
he was. At the start of season seven in the episode, Let's Spend the Night Together,

686
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:56,320
we finally meet Hyde's father, William Barnett, often turned to WB, played by Tim Reed.

687
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:05,760
At first, everyone is a bit unsure of how to talk to a black man.

688
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:29,440
Considering this is a small town in Wisconsin in 1979, it makes some sense

689
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:34,320
that no one on the show knows how to talk to a black person, as the town is almost certainly

690
01:14:34,320 --> 01:14:37,520
mostly white. But Hyde does take an immediate shine to his new father.

691
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,720
Although there's a little friction at first, the two eventually start forging a relationship,

692
01:14:56,720 --> 01:15:01,680
with Hyde working at one of the record stores his father owns. The introduction of WB introduces a

693
01:15:01,680 --> 01:15:06,480
new dynamic to the mostly white show, though only insofar as we get a lot of jokes like this.

694
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:16,560
Hyde also meets his half-sister Angie, played by Megalyn Etchikunwoke.

695
01:15:16,560 --> 01:15:20,160
It is interesting to see the introduction of a black family that's not only wealthy,

696
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:24,880
but so wealthy they're on a higher class level than any of the white characters. The impact of

697
01:15:24,880 --> 01:15:29,440
race on these characters doesn't really come up though aside from the many jokes about how they

698
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:34,880
are, in fact, black. Though that might reflect how wealth offers some degree of protection from

699
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:39,120
more common types of bigotry, none of the black characters are a big enough part of the series to

700
01:15:39,120 --> 01:15:43,920
really explore that issue though. What this means for Hyde is that he once again has a new father

701
01:15:43,920 --> 01:15:48,240
figure. His fourth of the series, it's not too difficult to parse that the show is telling us

702
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:52,800
what a troubled young man needs, is a father giving him some kind of guidance and structure,

703
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,920
a lesson so important it's repeated four times. Five if you count Eric in red. And with Tommy

704
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,360
Chong out of jail, the show brings back another father figure for good measure.

705
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:15,040
In season seven we see Hyde and Jackie once again back together, only to break up once more. Then

706
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:20,720
get back together again. And then break up one last time. That last breakup is particularly

707
01:16:20,720 --> 01:16:26,560
galling as it happens with Hyde walking in on Jackie and Kelso, again, mistakenly thinking they

708
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:31,600
slept together. This moment reinforces how cyclical the narratives on this show can get as

709
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:36,080
they're trapped in this decade repeating the same mistakes over and over as their show gets

710
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:40,560
extended long beyond its expiration date because of its need to make a profit for its corporate

711
01:16:40,560 --> 01:16:46,160
overlords. Or at least that's how I suspect Hyde would phrase it. In season eight we find out Hyde

712
01:16:46,160 --> 01:16:51,840
is permanently moved on from Jackie and married a stripper he met in Las Vegas. His new wife Samantha

713
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:57,600
is played by Jude Tyler. The marriage doesn't last when Hyde finds out his new wife already has

714
01:16:57,600 --> 01:17:03,200
a husband. Heading into 1979, Kelso was making some major strides towards growing up. He had

715
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:07,200
decided on the career path of becoming a police officer. I'm gonna be a cop!

716
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:19,760
Not too long after, when Kelso was trying to convince everyone he hooked up with Donna's

717
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:24,560
friend Brooke, played by Shannon Elizabeth, the truth comes out in an unexpected way.

718
01:17:32,240 --> 01:17:36,160
Although Brooke tells Kelso he doesn't have to be involved with the baby since she doesn't see

719
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:40,160
him as father material, Kelso eventually decides he wants to be a part of the life of his child

720
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:45,120
when they're born. Brooke's mother, played by Morgan Bearchild, plans on taking Brooke to Chicago

721
01:17:45,120 --> 01:18:04,720
to raise the child. When the baby is born, she's named Betsy. And eventually Kelso decides he can't

722
01:18:04,720 --> 01:18:09,760
stand to be away from his daughter, and after the police fire him, he moves to Chicago. Kelso's

723
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:14,400
maturing is difficult to pin down. If having a career wasn't the path to adulthood for him,

724
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:18,560
but being a father was, it does suggest the value of family over one's career. Though the

725
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:23,360
idea of Kelso being a cop is more a nightmare scenario than a standard career path. Kelso's

726
01:18:23,360 --> 01:18:27,840
departure was more likely triggered by Ashton Kutcher deciding to leave the series after its

727
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:31,520
seventh season, although he would make a few guest appearances in season eight to give his

728
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:37,440
character a proper send-off. And Kelso leaves point place for good. Well, I guess it's time to go,

729
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:40,480
so, see ya.

730
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:48,640
After his marriage to Laurie, Fez finally becomes an American citizen. He would go from working at

731
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:55,120
the DMV to getting a job as a shampoo boy at a salon, and of course being increasingly weird and

732
01:18:55,120 --> 01:19:07,360
creepy. And this is the stuff he talks about when he's not hiding in Donna's club.

733
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:12,880
Yeah, it's starting to get really weird with Fez. Jackie's life gets complicated after her

734
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:17,440
father goes to prison, and Jackie is left to fend for herself. This eventually leads to her and Fez

735
01:19:17,440 --> 01:19:21,520
moving in together. For a brief moment, it seemed as though Jackie would have a story arc that wasn't

736
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:26,800
about her dating life when she starts working in television for local TV star Christine St. George,

737
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:36,560
played by Mary Tyler Moore. But the job doesn't last, and eventually Jackie's story intersects

738
01:19:36,560 --> 01:19:51,040
with Fez for yet another romance. There are better reasons not to date Fez, mostly because

739
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:55,360
he has no boundaries in impressing himself upon women. But one of the strange quirks about Fez's

740
01:19:55,360 --> 01:19:59,920
gradual change over the years is that it simply gets put in the bucket of him being odd. It was

741
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:03,920
his character trait at the beginning of the series, and even though it's elevated dramatically,

742
01:20:03,920 --> 01:20:08,400
to the point where he's creeping around in the closet of his friend, he's still covered by the

743
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:13,440
odd foreigner label, and it's the second part of that Jackie has trouble with. Or at least she does

744
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,080
for a little while until she gets over it and decides to pursue Fez in earnest, heading toward

745
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:23,040
the show's finale. In the final year of the show, Kitty's journey through menopause finished,

746
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:27,920
and she went on another journey into heavy drinking. It's a far cry from the woman who

747
01:20:27,920 --> 01:20:33,040
once struggled with her need to nurture and how it led her to nursing. Post-menopause, most jokes

748
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:47,520
from Kitty were about her drinking problem. Kitty going from being the mother who brings

749
01:20:47,520 --> 01:20:52,160
her kids cookies and cocoa to the one who spends most of her time mixing drinks for herself would

750
01:20:52,160 --> 01:20:56,960
be an incredibly sad character arc on most other shows, but it's played with some levity here.

751
01:20:56,960 --> 01:21:00,800
It does raise the question of what menopause did to Kitty's psyche,

752
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,680
but that's never really explored on the show. Kitty's menopause and drinking reveal how tragedy

753
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:10,080
is molded through the candy colors of a sitcom to make things seem brighter, and maybe they're

754
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:15,280
doing the same thing with the whole decade of the 1970s. That could be why people love this show so

755
01:21:15,280 --> 01:21:20,000
much. It lets you smile through tragedy. It's good for coping. If it was too real, it would be too

756
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,280
heartbreaking. If it wasn't real enough, it wouldn't resonate. The balance is key. In earlier seasons,

757
01:21:25,280 --> 01:21:29,840
I think the show did a better job of that, but even in later ones, it does attempt to strike

758
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:34,720
some kind of balance. Red manages to find some new ventures when he stops working at Price Mart

759
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:39,360
and ends up opening a muffler shop. You might wonder where Red got the money for a muffler shop,

760
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:50,080
but he was creative with that. Red struggles to keep the shop open when a rival store from a big

761
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:55,920
chain opens up nearby, but luckily for him, they make an offer and Red decides to sell the muffler

762
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:11,120
shop. So now Red has enough money to retire. What might have been some bad luck hitting Red

763
01:22:11,120 --> 01:22:15,920
once again ends up in his favor since he's the guy who owned the muffler shop and not just someone

764
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:20,560
who worked there. Although Bob wasn't quite so fortunate in previous seasons, Red does show at

765
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:25,440
once odds improve if you can position yourself as the business owner than its worker. Although

766
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:31,360
looking at this in totality, it really seems like business is something of a crop shoot. Maybe

767
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:35,200
you'll succeed, maybe you won't. It all depends on whether or not big businesses come in and

768
01:22:35,200 --> 01:22:40,320
stomp you out of business or decide to buy you off. Although there is one consistent that remains

769
01:22:40,320 --> 01:22:44,880
true for all business ventures on this show, the only way Red could get into this position is that

770
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:49,280
he had to sell out his own son's future. It certainly says something that all the major

771
01:22:49,280 --> 01:22:54,320
business successes on this show involve screwing over another person. The Eric and Donna saga

772
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:59,360
continued with the wedding at the end of season 6 being called off when Eric got scared and ran

773
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:03,440
away before it could happen, in part because he realized the wedding was keeping Donna from

774
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:08,080
pursuing her dreams since she chose to stay in point place to be with him instead of going to

775
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:14,400
college. The pair spend season 7 together unsure of how their life will move forward. Donna decides

776
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,120
to dye her hair. The real reason for Laura Prepon doing this was because she needed to be blonde for

777
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:23,920
an upcoming movie she was starring in called Carla. Eric spends most of season 7 trying to

778
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:28,400
figure out what to do with his life before finally settling on becoming a teacher. Since

779
01:23:28,400 --> 01:23:33,040
Red spent all of Eric's college money on the muffler shop, Eric needs to find some other way

780
01:23:33,040 --> 01:23:37,760
of paying for college, and he comes up with an unorthodox solution. There's this program where

781
01:23:37,760 --> 01:23:42,960
you go and teach an impoverished area for a year and then they pay for your college. I signed up.

782
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,520
That's wonderful. So where then? Africa.

783
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:52,800
Africa, Wisconsin?

784
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,280
Eric will be spending next year teaching in Africa. We don't know where exactly,

785
01:23:57,280 --> 01:24:02,000
and the show never quite goes into detail. We only know it's somewhere in the second biggest

786
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,960
continent on the planet. I need these shots. Africa is very strict about these things,

787
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:10,720
and they're not strict about anything. I mean, the women walk around with their hooves hanging

788
01:24:10,720 --> 01:24:15,440
on. There's something that needs to be addressed that occurs constantly throughout this series,

789
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:20,240
particularly in the later seasons. Characters are increasingly ignorant or sometimes outright

790
01:24:20,240 --> 01:24:25,040
disrespectful and racist towards any culture outside of their Midwest bubble. This is excused

791
01:24:25,040 --> 01:24:30,240
by the context of the series, since it's just assumed that people in the 1970s were more likely

792
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:35,760
to be culturally insensitive. While that may be true, that 70s show in its inception seemed to

793
01:24:35,760 --> 01:24:40,400
want to be a little more enlightened than that. For example, Fez being welcomed into the gang of

794
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:44,560
friends was a gesture of kindness that was at odds with more ignorant characters such as Red,

795
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:48,400
and while they often didn't understand his cultural references, as his oddness perhaps

796
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:52,880
became too central a point of his character, there was a genuine attempt to not just make him a

797
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:57,440
walking collection of stereotypes. Similarly, when the first season introduced gay characters,

798
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:01,840
they resisted being tired cliches or harmful stereotypes, and the characters around them are

799
01:25:01,840 --> 01:25:06,640
far more accepting than one might expect from a group of straight teens in the 1970s. But by

800
01:25:06,640 --> 01:25:11,360
season 7, some of that care had faded away, and in the interest of letting us, the audience,

801
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,920
laugh at the racism of the past in the presumed comfort that it doesn't exist in the present.

802
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:21,040
Something that certainly isn't true, and breeds a degree of complacency towards racial issues.

803
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:25,680
When the show has its fun making fun of Africa in a broad context, it's nudging the audience with

804
01:25:25,680 --> 01:25:30,560
a knowing wink saying, isn't it great people aren't this ignorant anymore? When the truth is,

805
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:34,400
a lot of people would struggle to come up with the name of African countries where Eric might

806
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:40,160
be headed to. On the flip side, the ready acceptance of Hyde's new black family is lovely to see,

807
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:45,280
even if, in the case of characters like Jackie, it's motivated by greed. So, like many things in

808
01:25:45,280 --> 01:25:49,840
the later seasons of the series, there is a generous mix of good and bad that complicates

809
01:25:49,840 --> 01:25:55,440
characters that, ironically, behave very simply. It's an uneven tone that speaks to the strange

810
01:25:55,440 --> 01:26:00,720
lens sitcoms use to make the word simpler, yet complex enough to be convincing. At least for a

811
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:06,240
couple of laughs. As Eric prepares to head out to somewhere in Africa, he waves goodbye and is on

812
01:26:06,240 --> 01:26:16,640
his way east, across the Atlantic. The real reason Eric has to leave the show is because

813
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:21,760
Topher Grace had been looking to go beyond the series and would soon be appearing in movies.

814
01:26:21,760 --> 01:26:26,560
To replace him, the character of Charlie Richardson, played by Brett Harrison, was introduced.

815
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:30,080
And when Harrison was offered the lead in his own show, The Loop,

816
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:32,800
he was quickly killed off at the beginning of season 8.

817
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:45,440
To replace him, the character Randy Pearson, played by Josh Myers, was introduced.

818
01:26:52,640 --> 01:26:54,800
When Eric breaks up with Donna over a letter,

819
01:26:54,800 --> 01:27:00,880
Randy becomes her love interest through some of season 8. The fan reaction to Randy was not great,

820
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:05,360
and while Randy's presence wasn't the sole reason, ratings for season 8 were on a steady

821
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:10,240
decline. Without Eric and Kelso, that 70's show just didn't have the magic it once had.

822
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:14,240
It was then that the network decided to cancel it, with its final two episodes airing together,

823
01:27:14,240 --> 01:27:20,400
Love of My Life and That 70's Finale, ended the decade for good on May 18th, 2006.

824
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:24,400
In the penultimate episode of the series, characters are quickly moved into place for

825
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:29,200
the finale, so they can finally escape the 70's. Hyde is given a record store by his father.

826
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:34,000
Yes, you're the proud owner of the last remaining grooves.

827
01:27:37,120 --> 01:27:38,960
Holy crap, I own this place?

828
01:27:38,960 --> 01:27:40,480
Jackie and Fez get together.

829
01:27:48,160 --> 01:27:51,520
And we find out that Eric is coming back to point place.

830
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:03,440
Yeah, you're not going anywhere.

831
01:28:03,440 --> 01:28:08,240
The final episode of the series takes place, as you might expect, on New Year's Eve,

832
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:13,840
1979. But the surprise return we get isn't Eric. Rather, it's Kelso.

833
01:28:13,840 --> 01:28:16,240
There you guys are. Kelso!

834
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,520
Hey man, why don't you get back?

835
01:28:18,800 --> 01:28:21,760
Man, come on, I'm not gonna spend New Year's without my friends.

836
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,360
Come on! It's like, the turn of the century!

837
01:28:26,160 --> 01:28:30,000
As everyone celebrates the coming New Year inside, Donna waits outdoors,

838
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:34,160
before finding out that Eric was coming back, she had already made a remind to finally go to

839
01:28:34,160 --> 01:28:39,280
college. But with him returning, she can't bring herself to get on that bus out of town

840
01:28:39,280 --> 01:28:41,760
just yet. Not without seeing him first.

841
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,000
And as she reminisces about all the time they spent together, Eric returns.

842
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:47,920
Happy New Year.

843
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:52,320
Eric.

844
01:28:52,320 --> 01:28:53,040
Red was right.

845
01:28:56,160 --> 01:28:57,120
I am a dumbass.

846
01:29:00,640 --> 01:29:01,140
Donna.

847
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:04,160
I'm sorry.

848
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:11,040
And we end the series with one final circle.

849
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:13,920
Did you guys hear about that car that runs on water?

850
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:18,400
It's got a fiberglass air-cooled engine and it runs on water, man!

851
01:29:20,800 --> 01:29:23,680
It's like we never run out of things to talk about down there.

852
01:29:23,680 --> 01:29:26,560
And we count down the end of 1979.

853
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:29,680
Three, two, one!

854
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:35,520
Eric going away made his relationship with Donna so much more meaningful.

855
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:39,920
They both understood what they were missing in a way that a breakup doesn't quite match when

856
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:44,800
they see each other all the time. And it's that old saying of, if you love something, set it free.

857
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,360
If it returns, it was meant to be.

858
01:29:47,360 --> 01:29:51,840
As the show sends everyone away for the new decade, it seems to be telling the audience that

859
01:29:51,840 --> 01:29:55,760
everyone is gonna be okay. They'll all be fine no matter what might lay ahead.

860
01:29:55,840 --> 01:30:00,080
One touch I really liked was that the ending credits of the series are the same as the first

861
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:06,080
episode of the series. The gang is singing Tom Rungren's Hello It's Me. At the end of the pilot,

862
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:10,720
seeing this was an endearing introduction to these teenagers making their way through a decade

863
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:16,000
that was only vaguely familiar to me. But here at the end of the series, it's nostalgia for the

864
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:21,520
beginning of a show that was built on nostalgia. That 70 show is about these kids driving down the

865
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:26,640
street, taking their first step into the big new world. But this show isn't about that journey in

866
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:31,760
the new world. It's about being in that moment on the cusp of that journey. It's why everyone in the

867
01:30:31,760 --> 01:30:37,200
series is trapped in high school, in their teen years, in the 70s. It's a memory of that moment

868
01:30:37,200 --> 01:30:41,600
that stretches for as long as the series can hold on to it, when you felt like the world was going

869
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:46,880
to be something new and exciting. While it didn't always have the best grasp of its premise, it did

870
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:52,080
have a firm hold on that feeling it wanted to evoke. And those final lyrics we hear from Hello

871
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:58,800
It's Me sound even clearer. It's important to me that you know you are free, because I never want

872
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:00,160
to make you change for me.

873
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:17,760
The success of that 70 show spawned a spin-off a few years later. Although a lot of the same

874
01:31:17,760 --> 01:31:22,000
creative talent was responsible for the show behind the scenes, that didn't manifest itself

875
01:31:22,000 --> 01:31:29,120
into another hit. That 80s show debuted on January 23rd, 2002, to a warm response initially,

876
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:33,920
but quickly sank in the ratings throughout its first season. It was quickly cancelled after 13

877
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:39,440
episodes. There are a number of reasons cited for why the show failed, leaning a bit too hard on

878
01:31:39,440 --> 01:31:44,880
gags about the decade instead of having characters drive the series. Also, people had less nostalgia

879
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:49,840
for the 80s than they did the 70s, and the cast didn't quite have the same chemistry as the ones

880
01:31:49,840 --> 01:31:55,280
on that 70s show. Watching it again 20 years later, I personally didn't think it was as bad as I

881
01:31:55,280 --> 01:32:00,000
remembered it being, but it definitely doesn't have the magic of the original series it spun

882
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:05,120
off of. One interesting bit of trivia about the series is that it stars a young Glenn Howerton

883
01:32:05,120 --> 01:32:10,160
who would go on to play Dennis in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's rumored his character,

884
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:16,000
Corey Howard, supposedly was Eric Borman's first cousin, but this never actually comes up in the

885
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:27,920
series itself. On February 12, 1999, another That 70s Show program aired in England, under the name

886
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:34,560
Days Like These. This is a nearly identical remake of the American series, except subtly changed to

887
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:39,920
move the show from Point Place, Wisconsin to Blutton, England. The scripts were kept nearly

888
01:32:39,920 --> 01:32:45,040
identical aside from a few cultural references being changed. Only the British cast didn't quite

889
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:49,520
perform it with the same energy as the American one. Here's an example of two scenes and how they

890
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:50,800
played out in each show.

891
01:33:15,040 --> 01:33:35,840
It's not quite the same, is it? British audiences weren't very impressed and the show only aired

892
01:33:35,840 --> 01:33:46,800
at 10 of the 13 episodes produced. In October of 2021, Netflix announced they were producing

893
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:51,920
a new spin-off of That 70s Show titled That 90s Show. It would bring Kurtwood Smith and Deborah

894
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:56,800
Joe Rupp in their roles as Red and Kimmy Borman back. The premise of the series was that Eric

895
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:02,480
and Donna's daughter Leah was spending the summer of 1995 in Point Place. Aside from Smith and Rupp,

896
01:34:02,480 --> 01:34:08,960
the rest of the cast is made up of Callie Heverda, Ashley Afterhide, Miss Coronel, Maxwell A.C.

897
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:14,960
Donovan, Rainn Doy, and Sam Morales. Other original cast members slated to appear are

898
01:34:14,960 --> 01:34:20,800
Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama. Although, as of

899
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:25,440
the time of writing this, it seems they'll only be making guest appearances. Running for 10 episodes

900
01:34:25,440 --> 01:34:30,240
and shot in the multi-camera style of the original, it's already been filmed and is currently waiting

901
01:34:30,320 --> 01:34:40,160
for its premiere date on Netflix. Topher Grace left That 70s Show to star in Spider-Man 3 as

902
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:44,880
Eddie Brock slash Venom. He would go on to star in a number of other movies as well, including

903
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:50,800
In Good Company and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton. Most recently, he's been a part of the TV series

904
01:34:50,800 --> 01:34:56,720
Home Economics. Laura Prepon would appear in several TV and film projects following the end

905
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:01,440
of That 70s Show, most notably as the character Alex Vance in the Netflix series Orange is the

906
01:35:01,440 --> 01:35:05,520
New Black. Most recently, she and her husband celebrated the birth of their second child in

907
01:35:05,520 --> 01:35:11,360
February of 2020. Mila Kunis has been featured in several projects following the end of That 70s

908
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:17,760
Show, including Black Swan, Bad Moms, and Voice in the Character Meg in nearly 400 episodes of Family

909
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,720
Guy. In 2012, she began dating her former co-star, Ashton Kutcher, and the two would eventually

910
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:29,120
marry in 2015. They currently have two children together. Ashton Kutcher starred in a number of

911
01:35:29,120 --> 01:35:34,240
movies and TV shows, notably No Strings Attached, What Happened in Vegas, and he replaced Charlie

912
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:39,520
Sheen on Two and a Half Men. He's most recently starred in The Branch on Netflix, which ran for

913
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:44,560
four seasons, split into eight parts. In his personal side, in addition to marrying Mila Kunis

914
01:35:44,560 --> 01:35:50,080
and having two children, he's also in the process of treatment for a recent diagnosis of vasculitis.

915
01:35:50,640 --> 01:35:55,520
Wilma Roald Rama went on to appear on several TV shows and movies following the end of That 70s

916
01:35:55,520 --> 01:36:01,440
Show, perhaps most notably as the character Nick Torres on NCIS. He's also currently cast as Don

917
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:07,360
Diego de la Vega, better known as Zorro in an upcoming Zorro TV series. Kurtwood Smith would

918
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:12,320
continue his very prolific acting career with appearances on 24, Agent Carter, and doing voice

919
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:16,560
work on a number of different animated projects. Although it was a role he had before That 70s

920
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:20,720
Show, I personally remember him most fondly for his role in the Star Trek Voyager two-parter,

921
01:36:20,720 --> 01:36:25,520
Year of Hell. Deborah Jo Rupp has been working both on screen and on stage, including several

922
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:30,240
productions on Broadway. One of her most recent high-profile roles was on the WandaVision series.

923
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:34,800
She was also nominated for a Drama Desk Award for her portrayal of Dr. Ruth in the stage

924
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:40,240
production Becoming Dr. Ruth. Don Stark has been consistently working since the end of That 70s

925
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:43,920
Show, often with guest spots on a number of different TV programs. He also had several

926
01:36:43,920 --> 01:36:49,600
reoccurring roles on Hit the Floor and Marin. Tanya Roberts had largely stepped away from

927
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:53,680
the world of acting following her departure from That 70s Show to take care of her husband,

928
01:36:53,680 --> 01:37:01,280
her final roles in 2005 in the TV series Barbershop. Sadly, on January 4, 2021, she passed away due to

929
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:06,640
complications from an advanced case of sepsis. Lisa Robin Kelly left the world of acting after

930
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:12,560
That 70s Show, only to briefly reappear in two shorts. She had a series of high-profile arrests

931
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:17,120
related to substance abuse and domestic violence. She passed away on January 3,

932
01:37:17,120 --> 01:37:23,040
2014, while in rehab, and her cause of death is reported as multiple drug intoxication.

933
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:28,400
Tommy Chong has been working regularly since the end of That 70s Show, including a reunion with his

934
01:37:28,400 --> 01:37:34,640
longtime partner, Cheech Marin, to revive their classic stoner duo of Cheech and Chong. In 2012,

935
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:39,280
he announced that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was receiving treatment. As of 2019,

936
01:37:39,280 --> 01:37:45,440
he announced that he is currently cancer-free. In 2017, Danny Masterson had three separate

937
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:51,680
allegations of sexual assault filed against him, and on June 17, 2020, he was charged with three

938
01:37:51,680 --> 01:37:56,960
separate instances of rape. He is currently scheduled to be criminally tried on October 11,

939
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,920
2022. This is the part of the retrospective where I give you all some parting thoughts

940
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:07,120
to close this off, hopefully fostering some understanding of the good and bad of a classic

941
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:11,600
series. Maybe one you might want to go watch yourself and come up with your own reading for,

942
01:38:11,600 --> 01:38:16,480
or maybe one you'd just be happy knowing a little more about. I want to try something a little

943
01:38:16,480 --> 01:38:22,080
different, though, with this one. While working on this video, one problem I could not solve was

944
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:27,920
how to talk about Danny Masterson. Unlike Roseanne Barr or Bill Cosby, Masterson was not the driving

945
01:38:27,920 --> 01:38:33,200
force behind this production. His alleged sexual assault happened in his personal life and seemingly

946
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:38,480
didn't impact the production of the series. But even so, if you believe the women who have accused

947
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,640
him, and I am inclined to do that, it makes it difficult to watch without that knowledge

948
01:38:42,640 --> 01:38:47,760
constantly floating around in your mind. While researching this video, I also learned one of the

949
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:53,840
women who accused him, Chrissy Carnell Bixler, appeared in an episode of the series. What seems

950
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:58,720
to be just a fun little throwaway line in an episode takes on a different tone when you

951
01:38:58,720 --> 01:39:02,880
understand the context behind it. There's also the claims that Masterson is being protected by

952
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:07,840
the Church of Scientology, which is such a messy and complicated claim that I can't possibly do

953
01:39:07,840 --> 01:39:12,720
it justice in this video. There's lots of other resources, I'll link a few below if you'd like

954
01:39:12,720 --> 01:39:18,240
to learn more about this case. It raises important questions, like do the actions of this one man

955
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:24,640
wipe out an entire series? That 70s show wouldn't be the same without Hyde, but it wasn't exactly

956
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:29,520
his show. And the work of all those people being forgotten because of the actions of one man seems

957
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:33,840
unfair. If you're someone who wants to enjoy the show in spite of knowing what's been alleged

958
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:39,840
against Masterson, I think that's okay. But for some people, that just isn't possible. They can't

959
01:39:39,840 --> 01:39:45,120
watch this series without that knowledge tainting it and in some way undermining the experience,

960
01:39:45,120 --> 01:39:50,240
and I think that's okay too. People are allowed to have complicated relationships with art,

961
01:39:50,240 --> 01:39:56,000
and you're allowed to take what you want, or skip the process entirely if you don't want to deal

962
01:39:56,000 --> 01:40:01,280
with it at all. Regardless of how you feel about that 70s show, though, I do think what is very

963
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:07,040
important is that all claims of sexual assault should be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.

964
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:11,920
Ultimately, I think that's far more important than whether or not you can sit down and enjoy

965
01:40:11,920 --> 01:40:17,600
a sitcom without feeling guilty about it. That 70s show can decolored nostalgia, holding onto

966
01:40:17,600 --> 01:40:22,640
that naive optimism of your waning teen years. It's a show that helps you remember the good parts

967
01:40:22,640 --> 01:40:28,000
of the past while forgetting the bad. Just remember to keep one foot in reality, and get

968
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:36,960
ready to face it again when you're ready to leave the circle. The ending to this retrospective is

969
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:42,640
making me think there is a video that will one day need to be made about how to engage with art

970
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:49,200
that was, at least in part, created by people who have done harmful and sometimes heinous things

971
01:40:49,200 --> 01:40:55,600
behind the scenes. Speaking of values, though, if you think this video had any sort of value,

972
01:40:55,600 --> 01:41:00,320
do consider becoming a patron or member like the lovely names you see scrolling up the screen.

973
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:04,640
You'll have early access to videos in the future and a little extra say on what the next sitcom I

974
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:09,120
cover will be, and there are other little bonuses I've thrown along the way. If you would like to

977
01:41:20,960 --> 01:41:26,400
the credits, I want to share one of my favorite jokes from that 70s show. This is Red counseling

978
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:30,960
Eric after he accidentally ran over Donna's cat, Mr. Bonkers.
