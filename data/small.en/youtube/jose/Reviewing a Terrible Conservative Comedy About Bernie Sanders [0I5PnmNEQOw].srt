1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
I didn't expect this movie about Bernie Sanders' life to have so much sex stuff.

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
In December of 2020, the world was given a satirical movie about the life of Bernie

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,840
Sanders titled Free Lunch Express. It follows Sanders from his early days,

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,560
starting with his blood pact with Joseph Stalin to his more recent years where he was

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,720
nearly murdered by Hillary Clinton. Most movies about the lives of politicians don't have a lot

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,360
of laughs in them, and Free Lunch Express is no exception. Unlike a serious drama such as

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,320
Spielberg's Lincoln, this movie about the life of Bernie Sanders was supposed to be a comedy.

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,120
According to its writer-producer-director Lenny Britton, its mission first and foremost

9
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,920
was to be funny. Here's how the movie does a joke.

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:04,640
It's only going to get worse from here.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,040
The relationship a biopic has to historical facts tells us a lot about what the filmmaker's

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,320
concerns are. Most politicians have very rich, complex lives, and the details a filmmaker decides

13
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,360
to focus on reveals what part of their lives we as an audience are being told are most relevant to

14
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,760
whatever point the movie is trying to make. A satire is obviously going to take some liberties

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:27,840
with the subject's history for the purposes of humor. I'm sure no one watching this movie is

16
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
going to think that the whole blood pact thing with Stalin actually happened, nor would anyone

17
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,400
assume Bernie Sanders is actually having these Jojo Rabbit-esque moments where he talks to

18
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,960
an imaginary Stalin. This stuff is all fine. Well, not fine. It's completely devoid of humor,

19
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,680
but conceptually I can understand this attempt at humor being in a satire movie. It still makes

20
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,400
sense. The interesting parts of this movie start cropping up from the supposed facts that inform

21
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:58,480
some of these satirical twists, the true events that one would need to make a biopic. These changes

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,960
to Bernie Sanders' life seem less like an attempted humor and more like a misunderstanding

23
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
of the basic facts of his life. Here's one example. In the movie,

24
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,360
Sanders goes to Moscow with his first wife for their honeymoon.

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,480
We're going to Moscow on a honeymoon. Oh, Moscow? Really? You sure you don't want to just go to

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:22,480
Youngstown? Youngstown? Ugh. Seeing Moscow has always been my lifelong dream.

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,720
The right-wing character of Bernie Sanders is that he's such a committed communist that he went to

28
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,680
Moscow for his honeymoon. This isn't the joke. This is the setup for the joke. And if Bernie

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,080
Sanders' life is supposed to be setting up this comedy, it makes some glaring mistakes with the

30
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,200
facts here. Let's go over some of the problems. First off, Sanders and his first wife, Deborah

31
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,920
Schilling, never went to Moscow. They were married in the 1960s and the only traveling they

32
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,720
did I could find was a trip to Israel to work on a kibbutz, which was before they married.

33
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,600
They were only married for a few years, divorcing in the 1960s. The next problem is Bernie's trip

34
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,320
to Moscow happened in the 1980s. And even though it did happen the day after a second marriage to

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:04,720
Jane O'Meara, it wasn't a honeymoon, but actually a part of his official business as mayor of

36
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,320
Burlington, Vermont. And I should also mention that Sanders' second marriage is depicted in this movie

37
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:17,440
after he becomes senator in 2007, when in reality it was in 1988. That's a lot of stuff to get wrong.

38
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:22,800
And all of these facts were completely butchered so we can get this scene in Moscow where Sanders'

39
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,360
first wife is so disgusted with her honeymoon destination that she divorces him on the spot

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,840
and Bernie fakes having sex with her to impress his Soviet comrades who are listening in on them.

41
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:43,200
This exemplifies the movie's relationship with its subject history.

42
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,000
The joke isn't, let's pretend Bernie went to Moscow on his honeymoon. The joke is,

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,280
Bernie faked having sex on his Moscow honeymoon. You have to accept the lie in the premise to get

44
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,000
the joke. And the joke isn't even funny, so why bother with any of this? We aren't watching a

45
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,760
movie about the life of Bernie Sanders, we're watching a movie about a right-wing caricature

46
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,520
of Bernie Sanders with some bad jokes thrown at. Here's another example. In 1972, Bernie Sanders

47
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:12,880
wrote an essay about gender roles titled Man and Woman for an alternative newspaper that used some

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:18,320
rather tasteless creative imagery. It resurfaced in 2015 as part of an article in Mother Jones.

49
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,480
And while the spokesperson from his campaign distanced Sanders from the nearly 50-year-old

50
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:27,760
article, some hate was made about Sanders being some kind of S&M fanatic. Free Lunch

51
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,840
Express takes that misunderstanding from the right and makes this version of Bernie Sanders

52
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
some kind of sexually repressed guy who's constantly trying to get his S&M erotica published.

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:54,800
This, I suspect, is the basis for another tasteless joke where we meet Sanders' parents

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,760
who, for some reason, are really into hooking up. We meet them once in the opening scenes,

55
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:03,760
and then later on in the movie when Bernie is campaigning for political office. The joke,

56
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:07,520
I guess, is that older people with an active sex life are funny.

57
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,280
The truth is Sanders' parents had passed away before he was 22, well before he became a

58
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,440
politician. Keeping them alive for this lame joke seems pointlessly cruel and a needless explanation

59
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:25,120
for a lie about Bernie Sanders having some kind of repressed sexuality. There are so many instances

60
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,880
like this that I'm not sure how someone can really understand what this movie is saying without

61
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,800
having that right-wing caricature of Sanders in mind. And if you went into this movie having

62
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,720
never heard of Bernie Sanders, you would be no closer to understanding most of the basics of his

63
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,680
life, aside from him being a politician. I should reiterate that a movie, especially a satire,

64
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,920
doesn't need to be completely historically accurate, but when the real parts of a subject's

65
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:50,880
story that are highlighted are complete fiction, it reveals how worthless this movie is in depicting

66
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,920
its subject's life. It's a huge waste. And speaking of huge wastes, much to my own personal

67
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,880
heartbreak, Malcolm McDowell is in this movie as the narrator. He recently gave an interview about

68
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,120
this role in the movie and, to hear him tell it, he was apparently bored sitting at home without

69
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,880
much to do, thought the script was funny enough, and signed on to be the narrator.

70
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,480
They asked me to do it, and it was right in the middle of the pandemic, so

71
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,200
when there was nothing happening at all, and they all came up, everyone was in a bubble 12 feet away

72
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:28,640
and massed, whipped the mass off just to do the shoot. So it was sort of fun. It was fun doing it.

73
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,200
I wouldn't be surprised if he had only worked a day or two to deliver all his lines.

74
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
And, wow, to see deliver.

75
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,840
Hammy, over the top, and constantly silly, it's a performance that's both delightful and

76
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:01,680
completely above the likes of this movie. And I feel I have to defend McDowell's honor here.

77
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,160
While I don't know for certain what Malcolm McDowell's politics are, I suspect he's not a huge

78
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,600
fan of Donald Trump. From what I could gather in that recent interview, he's a Kamala Harris guy.

79
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:19,840
And, of course, the vice president nomination, now the elect, who is a terrific candidate, I think,

80
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,200
I mean, she's really wonderful. So I guess Malcolm McDowell's in the K hive. That's better than being

81
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:30,400
MAGA. And in an interview with Salon, McDowell's philosophy on making movies is beautifully summed

82
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,680
up by this quote. The whole point with careers is, and I learned this at a young age, you are not

83
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,240
going to make that many great movies in your life. So what's one more to the pile, I guess?

84
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,680
The narration was designed to fill in the gaps of the plot, sometimes jumping years into the future.

85
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,360
Strangely, there are these weird mockumentary type interviews with a few figures supposedly

86
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:57,840
from Sanders past. These interviews only exist in the first 20 or so minutes of the movie, though,

87
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,200
and then it just stops using them. Is this movie still a mockumentary if it only keeps

88
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:07,760
it up for the first quarter of the movie? It makes me suspect some ball was dropped during

89
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:17,360
a script rewrite and no one bothered to fix it. And speaking of lazy, let's look at some more of

90
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,000
the humor in this movie. Here's one example where Bernie is getting political advice from Ben and

91
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,800
Jerry of Ben and Jerry Ice Cream fame while getting high in the park. Ben and or Jerry gave

92
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:37,760
Bernie the most unfortunate of ideas. But you're hot. The joke here, I guess, is that Ben and Jerry

93
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:43,760
are gay. How is this a joke, though? In real life, they aren't, but why would it be funny if they were?

94
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,280
Another example of this movie's humor comes when we meet Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez late in the movie.

95
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,800
Here we are, two people of different generations trying to take the country downtown to socialism

96
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:01,440
town, Cory. Yeah, sure, sure. Sounding completely unlike herself, we see AOC speaking with an

97
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,560
accent and dropping it in some casual Spanish. It doesn't really sound like her at all. And even if

98
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,400
she did sound like this, why is it funny that she would have an accent? The idea here seems to be

99
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:16,640
that the left is hiding their identity and when the cameras stop rolling, they reveal the parts

100
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,360
of their identity that would supposedly hurt their popularity. But if anything, I think being

101
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,000
gay would win Ben and Jerry, who are very supportive of gay rights, more support within that community.

102
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:32,720
And AOC having an accent probably wouldn't bother a district that's 56% Hispanic. But I suspect this

103
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,160
movie isn't targeting an audience that might not find humor in two men being gay or a Hispanic

104
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
woman having an accent. It speaks volumes as to what this movie is trying to pass off as humor.

105
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,480
And speaking of that, did you really think a lazy right-wing movie mocking Bernie Sanders

106
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,280
wasn't going to have a little bit of anti-Semitism in it?

107
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,320
It's the adjectives that really hammer home the Jewish stereotypes here.

108
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,640
Ultimately, I think the reason this movie fails so completely is, aside from the lack of talent of

109
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,200
almost everyone involved, is it makes no effort to understand its subjects beyond the right-wing

110
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,920
caricature of him. Creating a movie that presents its subject in a way only those who despise Bernie

111
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,880
Sanders the most would be able to appreciate. And the humor is crafted with this audience in mind.

112
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,120
To the average person, at least based on the audience reviews for this movie, none of this

113
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:38,560
stuff is funny. But perhaps we need some perspective. Let's look at a similar movie.

114
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,760
In Oliver Stone's W, we get a satirical look at the life of George W. Bush, following him from

115
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,800
his days in college right up to his time in office as the 43rd president of the United States.

116
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,280
Although a film limited in its scope and perhaps not as attached to reality as it often presents

117
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,840
itself, W does distinguish itself from Free Lunch Express in that it presents a more complete

118
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,480
picture of its subject. It shows us the influence of George Bush Sr. on his son and how W's

119
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,720
relationship with him supposedly motivated his drive to be more than a perpetual failure,

120
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,560
and to right the wrong he believes his father made in Iraq. We also get a portrait of how

121
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,120
the Bush family's privilege carried a mediocre man to the highest office in the land as he's

122
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,920
surrounded by skilled political operatives and bequeathed his spot in politics by his very

123
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,880
successful father. And a number of scenes within this movie are created using verifiable moments

124
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,440
from Bush's past, sometimes recreating famous speeches or hearings with the film's performers.

125
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,040
Comparatively, Free Lunch Express never explores Sanders' motivation aside from being upset that

126
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,920
he was bullied in school. His political ambitions are supposedly driven by stealing campaign money,

127
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,240
something I couldn't find any evidence of him having done, and his political success is largely

128
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,040
presented as a lucky accident. One interesting similarity these two movies have is how they

129
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:54,000
explain the rises to power by their respective subjects. Sanders and Bush aren't presented too

130
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,960
favorably in their respective movies, so their rises to power are similar in that they're both

131
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:04,080
shabby dudes who fail upwards into their success. Both movies advance the idea that neither of these

132
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:09,520
two earned their way into future success. In W we see a shocking ambivalence at times, such as

133
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,480
President Bush giving out t-shirts to soldiers wounded in Iraq and in Free Lunch Express. Bernie

134
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,960
never even whispers about Medicare for All until it's time to make a deal with Hillary Clinton.

135
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,600
The idea that either of these men could care at all about the people they represent is never

136
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:29,200
seriously considered. Considering Bernie's whole brand is standing up for the little guy and he has

137
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,680
a history of activism and political engagement, ignoring these parts of his history seemed like

138
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,360
a deliberate effort to not understand him as a subject or at least not present these very real

139
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,880
parts of his history. These movies have a lot in common in that respect and it reveals that making

140
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,040
a movie like this is often designed to be a political statement rather than strictly a

141
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,560
comedy or a depiction of history. In W there are some notable omissions regarding the Bush

142
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,440
presidency. There's no mention of the terrorist attack on September 11th or the devastation of

143
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:04,160
Hurricane Katrina. It's a movie primarily concerned with trying to understand how the invasion of Iraq

144
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,560
happened. And even though it ultimately comes down hard on Bush for his role in the invasion, there's

145
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:13,360
still some strange affection for former President Bush, as we have moments of sympathy for a guy

146
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,320
doing the best he can with his limited faculties. In Free Lunch Express we see Bernie constantly

147
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,200
being a scheming, conniving, lazy villain. He's never portrayed as a sympathetic character,

148
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,440
with one exception. The only time you'll feel sympathy for Bernie in this movie is when he's

149
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,760
faced with an even greater villain. And of course I'm talking about Hillary Clinton. Although late

150
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,800
arrival into the movie it's amazing how terrifyingly she's portrayed. She bullies him, mocks him, and

151
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,280
even threatens his life. It seems like the Free Lunch Express's hatred for Hillary is so strong

152
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:46,240
that even a movie primarily built around mocking Bernie Sanders has to go out of its way to make

153
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,680
sure the audience knows Hillary Clinton is so much worse. And of course instead of offering a

154
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,360
sensible criticism of Clinton, something that's very easy to do, it instead shrapes into conspiracy

155
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,920
theories, like the Clintons supposedly having Vince Foster murdered. It's also another example

156
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:07,040
of how this movie is really built around right-wing caricatures and an alternate perspective of

157
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:12,720
reality. So of course Hillary Clinton is presented as the most evil person in politics. I've been

158
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,480
going pretty hard on Free Lunch Express, but it's also important for us to take a step back from

159
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:21,840
these movies and examine ourselves as the audience. Or since this is my video, examining myself as

160
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:27,040
the audience. A movie like W. Wood seemingly play better to a left-wing person such as myself,

161
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,920
and an obviously right-wing movie like Free Lunch Express would not. So my political leanings may

162
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,240
be coloring my interpretation here, since these movies are quite clearly shaped by the politics

163
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,960
of their respective filmmakers. But while I think W. is a better movie than Free Lunch Express,

164
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:46,800
I wouldn't call it good either. It felt long, with way too much emphasis on George W. Bush's

165
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,640
daddy issues, and wasn't really that funny. While it was comparatively the funnier of the two movies,

166
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:57,680
being funnier than Free Lunch Express isn't a very tough thing to do. But let's take a look at

167
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,600
another satirical biopic about a politician, or in this case eventual politician, one that was made

168
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:09,920
by actual comedians. Funnier Dies' 2016 movie Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal the movie gave

169
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,280
us a brief history of the eventual 45th president of the United States. Presented as if it were a

170
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:22,160
movie created by Donald Trump back in the 1980s, it has a very 80s aesthetic. The movie has cameos

171
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,280
from Alf and Christopher Lloyd. It even has Kenny Loggins' track over the credits. It's a reminder

172
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,240
that we used to think of Donald Trump as this ghost from the 80s, desperate to stay relevant

173
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:37,760
in the modern day. But now we think of a lot of other things when talking about this guy. You might

174
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,640
not recognize Johnny Depp as Donald Trump, but that's him under all that makeup. He's joined by

175
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:47,280
a host of other performers, many of them quite experienced in doing jokes. And I even popped

176
00:15:47,280 --> 00:16:00,240
in myself for a brief cameo. So was the NFL violating antitrust laws? Although well received

177
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:06,000
at the time, this movie has not aged well. The Trump jokes, which must have felt fresh in 2016,

178
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,320
now come across as boring and stale. The movie does reflect something very important though.

179
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,640
How we look at the lives of these figures is defined largely by the moment in which we look

180
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:19,200
back. Freelance Express gives us a look at the life of Bernie Sanders, based on a caricature

181
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:24,480
of him taken directly from the present. With his past life rewritten, to lead us towards this

182
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,720
bumbling communist who secretly loves Stalin. And W is very much the same, giving us a selective

183
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,680
look at George W. Bush's history based on the version of him we were seen as president at the

184
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,440
time, with the failure of a rock looming especially large as his second term in office drew to an end.

185
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,400
And the Trump movie is, as I mentioned, a look back at Trump before he assumed office when he

186
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,520
was simply an 80s relic. These movies are moments in time trying to stamp a specific understanding

187
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:55,520
of these politicians into the minds of their audience. This understanding will reflect the

188
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:59,600
politics of the filmmaker, and if we're really lucky, it will give us a greater understanding

189
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,800
of the subjects. We know Freelance Express is no good to us, and W is fixated on one major

190
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,920
aspect of the Bush presidency, and the Donald Trump movie only looks at who Trump was before

191
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:15,040
he assumed his role in office. So let's look at one more political satire biopic that very

192
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,160
deliberately looks at one politician from a moment in time that might give us a better look at the

193
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,800
impact they had on the world. Armando Nucci's 2017 movie The Death of Stalin offers a more

194
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:32,160
interesting take on the satirical political biopic based on a graphic novel from 2012 by Fabian

195
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,680
Nury and Thierry Robin, which subject Joseph Stalin spends most of the movie dead, or almost

196
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:42,080
dead, and we spend the bulk of the movie watching the many men in his orbit scramble to make sense

197
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:47,760
of a nation held together by this one man. It, of course, takes a lot of liberties with historical

198
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,000
facts, but it does so in service to a greater narrative about how authoritarian rule does not

199
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,280
abide sharing power, and how Stalin structured his government around fear of him. You learn much about

200
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:03,120
the stature he grew to in his final days by seeing the effect his sudden absence had on those around

201
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:08,080
him. We may never understand the any workings of these political figures, especially when they're

202
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,480
dead, but we can learn something of them through art that highlights how silly it is to have a world

203
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,520
where the death of one guy can bring the ruling structure of an entire nation to a screeching halt.

204
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,400
No doubt there are plenty of historical inaccuracies in The Death of Stalin, and it's

205
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,120
jarring to see men who help to commit atrocities being portrayed as bumbling fools, even when the

206
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:32,240
movie makes no attempt to hide their more monstrous sides. Thousands of people died during this movie,

207
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:38,000
and execution scenes are played for laughs. It's a wonderful embodiment of a dark comedy. And it

208
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,200
gets away with all of this, because it managed to do one thing that Free Lunch Express failed at

209
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,480
miserably. The death of Stalin is funny.

210
00:18:46,480 --> 00:19:03,840
All the faults I found with Free Lunch Express might have seemed like nothing had it made me

211
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:09,920
laugh throughout its runtime. But instead, I sat there with a bored expression, counting each

212
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,320
excruciating minute. If you're curious to know what joke got me the closest to laughter,

213
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:30,640
it was this one. That's as good as it got. The reasons for Free Lunch Express not being funny

214
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,160
vary. One of the main problems is how exhaustively conservative it is. Not with its politics,

215
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:41,040
although it is conservative politically, but rather, it's conservative with its humor. The

216
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:46,160
jokes amount to nothing more than Bernie constantly smoking pot, old people getting frisky,

217
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:50,960
and ham-fisted caricatures. It all feels like something ripped from a comedy 20 years ago.

218
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:57,120
One of the taglines of this movie is that it comes from the creators who saw Airplane too many times.

219
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:02,320
That movie came out 40 years ago. And while it holds up in some ways, largely due to the talent

220
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:06,880
of the people who created it, comedy and film has evolved quite a bit since then. Free Lunch

221
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:12,800
Express doesn't seem to have gotten that message. Comedy generally doesn't age well, so boring from

222
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:17,760
the past can be a risky thing to do. While sometimes humor is lost through changing values

223
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:22,240
in a culture, and when it comes to making fun of people for their ethnicity or sexuality, that

224
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,480
definitely seems like a good thing to me. There's also the simple fact that the more often you hear

225
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:32,160
the same joke, even one that's acceptable, the less funny it gets over time. Some comedy holds

226
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,920
up and some does it, and it takes a sound comedic mind to know when to replicate and when to innovate,

227
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:43,440
not pushing the envelope in a way that drags comedy back towards tired cliches, but instead pushing

228
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,560
it into new exciting directions. There is no innovation in Free Lunch Express. It rehashes

229
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,960
jokes that have been in movies for decades, and it doesn't do a particularly good job of retelling

230
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,520
them. It would be unfair to say politically conservative artists can't be funny, but to be

231
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,160
funny to a modern audience, it requires them to be less conservative artistically.

232
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:08,240
There you have it. A tale so curious. It may seem quite spurious.

233
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,480
The choices made surrounding the making of this movie raise important questions about the

234
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:18,000
filmmakers involved. Who is writer-director-producer Lenny Britton, and what does he have against

235
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,760
Bernie Sanders? Leonard Wheeler Britton currently serves as the lead writer-director for a production

236
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,680
company called Right and Funny, a name which is only half right. In his younger days, he worked as

237
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,520
a writer before taking over his father's business, Britton Lumber Landscape at Feed. I couldn't figure

238
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,880
out exactly what he was writing though. The most interesting part of his CV is that Britton ran for

239
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:46,560
office in 2010 in Vermont, for the Senate. And while it would have been too perfect had his

240
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,600
opponent been Bernie Sanders himself, he instead ran against the other senator from Vermont, Patrick

241
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Leahy, who's been holding that seat for decades. Naturally, Britton lost, though the 30% of the vote

242
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,680
he got was more than Leahy's last Republican challenger could achieve. And Britton gave us

243
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:09,040
several memorable campaign ads. This is a bill for your family share of the national debt. It's $168,000.

244
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:14,800
This is a joke, right? Miss, we're from the government. There is no joking. That's a lot of money,

245
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:20,000
mister. Better get a paper route, Billy. When one of these ads proved a minor viral hit,

246
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,800
nabbing tens of thousands of views compared to the usual few hundred, it convinced Britton and

247
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:29,600
his partner, Bradford Broyles, to step into the world of comedy. So they decided to make some

248
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,800
scripted comedy from a conservative standpoint. As to how a former senatorial candidate got the

249
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:39,600
funding to make a movie, the answer to that lies with the executive producer for the film, Lenore

250
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,200
Broughton. Broughton is an heiress living off the fabulous wealth of her late grandfather,

251
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,640
Sue Lavery, a businessman from the early half of the 20th century, whose fortune was estimated to

252
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:56,720
be 327 million dollars when he retired in 1955. Although very little is known about Broughton,

253
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,160
as she's a very private person, one thing very much publicly available is her extensive support

254
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:06,560
of Republican politicians, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars every election cycle,

255
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:11,280
typically on hard-right candidates. And naturally one of those candidates included Britton's run

256
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,840
for Senate in 2010. Broughton has helped finance a number of right-wing media outlets,

257
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,640
such as True North Reports, which a brief glance at reveals plenty of right-wing nonsense right down

258
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,760
to reposting clips from Tucker Carlson's Nightly Hour of Trash. Broughton apparently saw some value

259
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,920
in Britton's vision for a movie mocking Bernie Sanders, and as is predictable, this isn't the

260
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:34,880
first time she's financed his antics. Aside from those campaign contributions, she's also financed

261
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:40,400
a few of his other projects, such as a web series, News Done Right, mocking Vermont Republican

262
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,600
governor Phil Scott for being far too moderate, and she also financed a web series that I've been

263
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,960
told is a comedy starring Kevin Sorbo, titled The World According to Billy Potwin. Although the

264
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,560
series was originally Sorbo-less, he joined in its second season, replacing the previous actor

265
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,080
who had the role of Nate Potwin, the patriarch of the Potwin clan, and of the four shorts produced

266
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,880
in the Sorbo era, three were cut into a single episode, which seems to be serving as a pilot for

267
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,320
the series. Here's a little taste of what this show is like.

268
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,280
And if we do not reduce our carbon footprint, the polar caps will melt,

269
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:20,320
and the rising sea level will put major American coastal cities underwater.

270
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,320
So New York, Miami, and Los Angeles underwater. What's the downside?

271
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,120
Billy!

272
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,320
Billy's grandfather is played by Barry Bostwick of Rocky Horror and Spin City fame. I can only

273
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:37,280
hope he just really needed the money, especially since they spelled his name wrong in the credits.

274
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,200
You may recognize the actor who played young Bernie Sanders in Free Lunch Express,

275
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:46,160
taking on the role of Billy Potwin. This young man is named Jonah Britton,

276
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,040
and he is the son of series creator Lenny Britton. Although it had a very brief run online,

277
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,800
this web series got a full season with at least eight episodes produced so far,

278
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:59,520
though they have yet to air, it doesn't seem to have a distributor yet. But if it gets one,

279
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,120
I'll make a whole video looking at what I'm sure will be a fantastic sitcom.

280
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:08,000
There's some sweet irony here where a wealthy financier who didn't earn a cent of her own money

281
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,720
is financing an unfummy former politician to make bad entertainment for a right-wing audience who

282
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,200
wants to fuel their hatred for Bernie Sanders. When Bernie is presented as a hopeless slacker

283
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,440
who locked his way into his position, it seems a more fitting description for those responsible

284
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,880
for this lazily put together movie, financed on the back of inherited wealth, and constructed

285
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:31,840
by someone who doesn't appear to have any talent whatsoever for comedy. Free Lunch

286
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:36,960
Express is a movie that demands a response that's as lazy as the effort that went into making it.

287
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,000
A waste of time for everyone involved, I encourage all of you to keep not watching it.

288
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,520
Originally, this video was actually going to be entirely about the whole Billy Potwin series,

289
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
but there were only a few shorts and it didn't feel quite so meaty,

290
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,440
and I wasn't sure there was enough content there for me to make a whole video.

291
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:01,360
While doing my research, I decided to watch Free Lunch Express just to get a sense of what

292
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:06,080
Britain is all about in his creative work, and there was so much there that I just felt like

293
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:10,400
it would make a much better subject for a video. And there were so many things in this movie I

294
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:16,000
didn't even get to touch that were just absolutely atrocious. So consider this a sanitized reading of

295
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,760
the movie that doesn't bombard you with every last morsel of its garbage. If you enjoyed this movie,

296
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:25,440
you can contribute to this channel by becoming a patron or a member who gets your name in the

297
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,320
credits like these lovely people. You also get early access to videos and downloads to my theme

298
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,000
songs, and I'm trying to create regular blog posts every month on my Patreon and did community posts

299
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,680
for members just to keep people on the loop on what's happening with the channel and what new

300
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:43,680
videos are coming down the line, so that's a nice extra as well. If you'd like to support the channel

301
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,480
in a non-monetary way, you can like, comment, subscribe, and ring the bell for notifications.
