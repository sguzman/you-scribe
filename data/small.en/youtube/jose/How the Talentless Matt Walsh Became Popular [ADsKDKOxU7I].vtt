00:00.000 --> 00:06.480
Matt Walsh is not an interesting guy. His talking points are poorly evidenced and infantile,

00:06.480 --> 00:12.000
his delivery is flat and lacking in charisma, and the subjects he covers reveal an embarrassingly

00:12.000 --> 00:17.600
narrow perspective of the world. But he is incredibly lucky, and that's the secret to

00:17.600 --> 00:23.440
his success. Matt Walsh matters insofar that he serves as an object lesson on how right-wing

00:23.440 --> 00:28.800
media figures continuously push on the limits of acceptable discourse to direct society backwards

00:28.800 --> 00:33.200
into a regressive state that strips away the rights of people to create a religiously centered

00:33.200 --> 00:38.560
culture. This kind of extreme Christian conservatism has been going on for a long time, and it's

00:38.560 --> 00:44.480
important to continuously oppose. But Matt Walsh himself? He's mediocre at best. There are a lot

00:44.480 --> 00:49.040
of other people doing the same thing and often much better than he is, but why is he someone

00:49.040 --> 00:53.360
people suddenly have to care about? Let's do a quick rundown of this guy's history if you're not

00:53.360 --> 00:57.840
familiar with him. Originally a radio host in Delaware, Walsh bounced around from a few jobs

00:57.840 --> 01:02.880
struggling to last for more than a year or two. He started a blog in 2012, eventually catching

01:02.880 --> 01:08.800
the attention of Glenn Beck's The Blaze in 2014. In 2017 he started writing for Ben Shapiro's The

01:08.800 --> 01:15.520
Daily Wire, and he got his own show, The Matt Walsh Show, in 2018. But it wasn't until 2022 that he

01:15.520 --> 01:20.640
really started catching people's eye, notably with his anti-trans movie What is a Woman.

01:20.640 --> 01:25.520
As his biggest success by far, it would be weird not to mention it, but I'm not going to go too

01:25.520 --> 01:30.640
into depth on this particular movie because it's been thoroughly debunked by other people on YouTube.

01:30.640 --> 01:34.960
So if you want a detailed breakdown, I would recommend Jessie Jender's videos on the subject.

01:34.960 --> 01:40.320
She goes into great detail on why this movie is a little propaganda. But we do at least have to

01:40.320 --> 01:44.960
address what kind of content he puts out there, so instead I'm going to take a look at what it's

01:44.960 --> 01:51.200
like to watch his show. The Matt Walsh Show has a basic formula. He has one story he speaks to for

01:51.200 --> 01:55.920
the first 15 to 20 minutes of the show, then a series of five headlines he gives a couple of

01:55.920 --> 02:01.600
minutes to, then he responds to viewer comments, and finally one last story to cap off the episode.

02:01.600 --> 02:06.080
Although it's segmented to give the show the appearance of variety, the only real difference

02:06.080 --> 02:11.040
is the length of each segment as pretty much all of it is just Walsh commenting on a piece of news

02:11.040 --> 02:16.240
or another commentary. The first thing I noticed while watching is that, even for the big stories

02:16.320 --> 02:22.480
up front, Matt Walsh very rarely goes into detail about any subject he's supposedly commenting on.

02:22.480 --> 02:27.280
This is particularly obvious when he discusses trans issues, something he typically touches

02:27.280 --> 02:34.240
on several times in episode. In one episode, from May 2nd, 2023 titled Princeton Professor

02:34.240 --> 02:42.240
Tries to Debunk Biology Fails Hilariously, episode 1156, my god he's done a lot of these,

02:42.240 --> 02:46.160
Walsh responds to an article published on the Scientific American website.

02:46.160 --> 02:52.000
For some context before we jump in, this article is titled Here's Why Human Sex is Not Binary,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.880
Over the Don't Make a Woman, and Sperm Don't Make a Man by Augustin Fuentes, a professor of

02:56.880 --> 03:02.800
anthropology at Princeton University. This article is a response to how the emphasis is often placed

03:02.800 --> 03:07.280
on how people are assigned male or female at birth on the basis of whether they produce

03:07.280 --> 03:12.800
sperm or ova. He provides a few examples of people reducing sex to one of those two things,

03:12.800 --> 03:17.520
and then explains with more examples and commentary from various scientific sources

03:17.520 --> 03:22.560
how the many complications of human sex make it difficult to place it in a binary.

03:22.560 --> 03:26.400
Here's an excerpt from the article that sums it up well. When someone states that

03:26.400 --> 03:32.320
quote, an organism's sex is defined by the type of gamete, sperm, or ova it has the function of

03:32.320 --> 03:38.960
producing, unquote, and argues that legal and social policy should be quote, rooted in properties

03:38.960 --> 03:45.120
of bodies, unquote, they are not really talking about gametes and sex biology. They are arguing

03:45.120 --> 03:50.000
for a specific political and discriminatory definition of what is quote unquote natural

03:50.000 --> 03:54.720
and quote unquote right for humans based on a false representation of biology.

03:54.720 --> 03:59.120
And he gives several historical examples of what that discrimination has often looked like.

03:59.120 --> 04:04.240
It's a pretty good article that offers a primary for why sex shouldn't be understood as a binary

04:04.240 --> 04:08.720
and focuses on how sex is used by political actors to discriminate against others.

04:09.280 --> 04:14.720
Matt Walsh is not so kind in his assessment of the article. What's most noticeable in his analysis

04:14.720 --> 04:20.000
though is how shallow his reading of the article is. Here's how he starts a segment. Starting at

04:20.000 --> 04:24.800
the top of the article says, there are those politicians, pundits, and even a few scientists

04:24.800 --> 04:30.960
who maintain that whether our bodies make ova or sperm are all we need to know about sex.

04:31.760 --> 04:38.080
We already see the game that he's playing. The headline promises proof that human sex is not

04:38.080 --> 04:44.080
binary. This is a big promise. But then in the first sentence, Professor Fuentes sets himself up

04:44.080 --> 04:51.520
for a very different and much smaller task. It's weird that Matt Walsh is calling the first sentence

04:51.520 --> 04:56.560
some kind of sleight of hand when it was clear what the article was about from the subheading.

04:56.560 --> 05:01.360
Though that part of the article is never shown or read during this segment, just the broad headline

05:01.360 --> 05:06.080
up top. Kind of be like talking about the Star Wars movies without including their subheadings.

05:06.080 --> 05:09.840
It kind of is important to differentiate them and give you a little more context of what's being

05:09.840 --> 05:14.400
discussed, but instead we're getting context removed so Matt Walsh can more easily make his

05:14.400 --> 05:19.040
point. You really get the impression he either has it read or is deliberately ignoring certain

05:19.040 --> 05:23.840
parts of this article. Here's some more evidence of that. He announces his intention to respond to

05:23.840 --> 05:30.400
the claim that whether our bodies make ova or sperm are all we need to know about sex, except

05:30.400 --> 05:36.160
that, well, nobody ever said that ova and sperm are all we need to know about sex. If you read the

05:36.160 --> 05:41.040
original Scientific American article, you can see he's linked several examples of people saying

05:41.040 --> 05:44.880
just that. Not that you have to go anywhere else because you can see Walsh do a version of it

05:44.880 --> 05:49.280
himself less than a minute later. He's not actually, it looks like we're disproving it,

05:49.280 --> 05:55.360
he's just adding on other details. But even if those other details are true, that wouldn't

05:55.360 --> 06:01.040
disprove the basic fact that there are only male and female gametes, which means that there are

06:01.040 --> 06:07.040
only two sexes, which means that sex is binary. Reading the article, Professor Fuentes clarifies

06:07.040 --> 06:12.960
that when someone, like Matt Walsh, claims there are other factors, they never seem to explain

06:12.960 --> 06:18.720
anything beyond genitals and gametes. This video is just another case of that. We're told there are

06:18.720 --> 06:23.120
other factors, but never what those factors actually are. Seems like it would be a really

06:23.120 --> 06:28.880
good time to bring them up, but we just don't get them here. The segment is exhausting in that it's

06:28.880 --> 06:33.520
more or less Walsh going through the article, reading lengthy excerpts, and reacting to them,

06:33.520 --> 06:38.400
but each time he misses crucial context that would either change or complicate what he's trying to

06:38.400 --> 06:44.000
respond to. He'll complain that the article is just making empty assertions, apparently unaware

06:44.000 --> 06:49.200
that in the original you can see it links to many sources, several from peer-reviewed journals. It

06:49.200 --> 06:53.120
actually assembles quite a bit of evidence to support each claim that's being made. Not that

06:53.120 --> 06:57.680
you could ever tell from the Walsh segment, since the excerpts are just displayed as text and you

06:57.680 --> 07:02.400
can't really tell, they're linking to a lot of supporting information. Throughout this entire

07:02.400 --> 07:08.720
segment, Matt Walsh doesn't cite a single source. He just makes a vague allusion to the science.

07:08.720 --> 07:13.280
This is a pattern of his. The challenge in responding to so much of what Matt Walsh says

07:13.280 --> 07:18.640
is that he not only doesn't understand what he's responding to, whether that's deliberate or not,

07:18.640 --> 07:24.320
he also refuses to do any homework. If someone cites scientific research that counters his claim,

07:24.320 --> 07:28.240
he just doesn't acknowledge it. Walsh smugly argues at the end,

07:28.720 --> 07:37.200
Variations within a category do not invalidate the category. Males need to exist as a category

07:37.200 --> 07:42.240
in order for us to say anything about a male, a human male, such as human males are all different,

07:42.240 --> 07:47.840
they have different expressions. This article is not arguing that categories within sex don't exist.

07:47.840 --> 07:53.920
Categories do exist within a spectrum. When a scientist says light is a spectrum, for instance,

07:53.920 --> 07:58.880
they're not saying that colors don't exist, just that the boundaries between colors are not so clear

07:58.880 --> 08:04.400
cut as they would be in a binary. And Walsh doesn't even seem to understand the basic point of this

08:04.400 --> 08:09.840
article. It's not about upending some kind of scientific consensus that he's imagined. It's

08:09.840 --> 08:15.360
using established science to talk about how that science is politicized. And Matt Walsh is doing

08:15.360 --> 08:20.480
that politicizing in this very video. He's not engaging with any of the material in a meaningful

08:20.480 --> 08:26.400
sense, he's just twisting it to meet his own ends. This is what Walsh's content often boils down to,

08:26.400 --> 08:32.240
butchering evidence to make a hateful point. In the May 3rd, 2023 episode of his show,

08:32.240 --> 08:39.120
others of trans kids give insane reasons for transitioning their children, episode 1157,

08:39.120 --> 08:43.600
we get all of that ignorance distilled into one of Matt Walsh's favorite rhetorical moves.

08:43.600 --> 08:47.760
But we don't even need to talk about the science, because it's also logically fallacious. It doesn't

08:47.760 --> 08:52.160
make any logical sense. Of all the episodes I watched while researching this video,

08:52.160 --> 08:56.800
he never gets around to talking about the science. He would rather fixate on the simplified language

08:56.800 --> 09:01.520
of activists than actually dive into the science he's supposedly defending. And that's how he

09:01.520 --> 09:07.120
operates on most topics. In another episode, the left demands we surrender our families and

09:07.120 --> 09:13.040
communities to violent criminals, episode 1159. He describes a story where a trans man,

09:13.440 --> 09:18.560
Brown, in San Francisco was shot and killed by armed security outside of Walgreens after Brown

09:18.560 --> 09:24.400
was suspected of shoplifting. Since no charges were filed and Brown was trans and black,

09:24.400 --> 09:28.640
and since this happened in San Francisco, Matt Walsh believes we don't need to look at the actual

09:28.640 --> 09:35.200
details of this case. As we know, the official legal bar for self-defense is set at a certain

09:35.200 --> 09:40.960
height. But the unofficial bar for self-defense against someone who belongs to three different

09:40.960 --> 09:46.720
victim classes is set significantly higher. And this security guard apparently cleared both the

09:46.720 --> 09:50.960
official bar and the unofficial bar, which is all we really need to know about the case.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.160
He mentions three victim classes in this clip because he's also misgendering Brown. Actually,

09:56.160 --> 10:00.960
looking at the details of this case reveals some interesting facts, such as Brown was alleged to

10:00.960 --> 10:05.920
have threatened to stab the security guard, yet no knife was recovered at the scene. And Walsh's

10:05.920 --> 10:10.080
commentary completely ignores that the fact that this killing has raised an interesting question

10:10.080 --> 10:15.600
about armed security being used at a drugstore. We can see Walsh lie about this in real time as he

10:15.600 --> 10:21.200
describes the activists. That's why activists in San Francisco are now calling for the abolition

10:21.200 --> 10:26.320
of security guards in response to this incident. Activists aren't calling for the elimination of

10:26.320 --> 10:31.040
security guards, though. We can see that in the article Walsh himself is reading out. It's very

10:31.040 --> 10:35.760
explicit about it being armed security that they're concerned about. Instead of dealing

10:35.760 --> 10:39.760
with the points being raised by activists, Walsh would sooner misrepresent them so he can say stuff

10:39.760 --> 10:49.360
like this. Stealing isn't worth the cost of human life. So don't steal. Walsh then goes on to make

10:49.360 --> 10:53.920
a painfully simplistic argument about the need to defend property with lethal force, which includes

10:53.920 --> 10:59.840
anything you might get from a Walgreens. It's a very bad and silly point on the face of it.

10:59.840 --> 11:04.880
If you need a YouTuber to explain why someone shouldn't be executed on the spot for stealing

11:04.880 --> 11:11.120
loaf of bread or even, as Walsh at one point speculates, some fancy headphones, then you have

11:11.120 --> 11:15.200
a perspective on life that I don't think is going to be changed by a single YouTube video. Here's

11:15.200 --> 11:19.840
some more criminal justice reform ideas from Walsh. This time it's regarding the death penalty for

11:19.840 --> 11:25.040
pedophiles. Not only are we executing these people, but we're doing it quickly. We're not giving them

11:25.040 --> 11:31.440
30 years to appeal, okay? The conviction is passed down, you're convicted, you're guilty, you've been

11:31.440 --> 11:40.560
found guilty, and then the execution is carried out the next day. Take them up, take them out to

11:40.560 --> 11:45.200
the gallows, you bring them up on the platform, you tie a rope around their neck, pull the lever,

11:45.200 --> 11:50.400
boom, it's done. Walsh concocts this whole imaginary scenario that, I'm sure in his mind,

11:50.400 --> 11:54.960
makes perfect sense. In the real world though, death sentences are highly contested because

11:54.960 --> 11:59.440
many of them are overturned. For example, the Innocence Project specializes in overturning

11:59.440 --> 12:03.600
wrongful convictions through more modern investigative techniques, and many others

12:03.600 --> 12:07.760
sentenced to death have had those convictions overturned when new evidences discovered.

12:07.760 --> 12:13.200
Walsh's fantasy leaves no room for that and would mean innocent people would die. It also has this

12:13.200 --> 12:18.800
assumption that the justice system is perfect, which is just not true. Even on the point of a

12:18.800 --> 12:23.760
hanging being quick and effective, the reason hangings were stopped was because they often aren't.

12:23.760 --> 12:28.960
A botched hanging results in someone being slowly strangled to death. It's a struggle to describe

12:29.040 --> 12:34.160
Walsh's arguments as anything more than childish and lazy. He's very good at finding a way to never

12:34.160 --> 12:39.040
think deeply about any of the topics he covers. Why cite scientific research when you can simply

12:39.040 --> 12:44.400
make a reference to the science? Why honestly debate what activists are saying when you can

12:44.400 --> 12:49.760
create a simpler strawman to rail against instead? Why genuinely consider how the death penalty is

12:49.760 --> 12:55.200
applied when you can instead make up an imaginary scenario that is completely divorced from reality?

12:55.200 --> 13:00.000
Poor arguments framed by missing context are all his show is though. He does devote a lot of

13:00.000 --> 13:05.120
time to creating bait. This is usually in the shape of having an over-the-top reaction about

13:05.120 --> 13:10.240
trivial things. For example, calling people savages if they let their pets sleep in the same bed.

13:14.000 --> 13:19.760
He also describes adults who like Disney World as mentally ill and he hates bicycle lanes.

13:19.760 --> 13:25.680
It's here his commentary is more obviously laid bare as the trolling it so often is. And what

13:25.680 --> 13:30.560
makes it effective is that it's hard to tell apart from his more serious commentary. They're

13:30.560 --> 13:36.080
similarly poorly argued and often based on Walsh's gut feelings about something and he's needlessly

13:36.080 --> 13:40.720
confrontational about everything he says. It would be nice if he were just a silly guy we could

13:40.720 --> 13:46.080
afford to ignore, crying about people who let their pets sleep on the bed, using his pathetic

13:46.080 --> 13:51.040
bait to get media watchdogs and other commentators like myself to address him like he's someone

13:51.040 --> 13:56.400
worth considering. And if that was all he was, I wouldn't waste time talking about him in a video

13:56.400 --> 14:01.280
like this one. Instead, I think it's important to acknowledge this bait because it reflects the

14:01.280 --> 14:06.720
soft nature of all his news commentary and there are aspects of that commentary that are genuinely

14:06.720 --> 14:12.240
harmful. The bait and the harmful commentary are similar in that none of it is very substantial

14:12.240 --> 14:18.080
and whenever it approaches any subject that has any complexity whatsoever, for example gender,

14:18.080 --> 14:23.120
all that nuance and complexity gets wiped away so Matt Walsh can comment on it at his own level.

14:23.120 --> 14:28.400
And as embarrassing as all of this is, the saddest part of the show is when he starts arguing with

14:28.400 --> 14:35.840
YouTube comments. And at Accretionist says, yes, respecting LGBT people is difficult for you and

14:35.840 --> 14:41.200
asking for that respect is brainwashing. We understand witless sadism, Matt. Well, I'm sure

14:41.200 --> 14:47.280
you do. Or what he calls on his audience to harass Dwayne Wade. Dwayne Wade everywhere he

14:47.280 --> 14:53.520
goes should be jeered and mocked and shouted at everywhere he goes. That should happen.

14:53.520 --> 14:59.120
And there are so many other examples where Matt Walsh just seems determined to come off as like

14:59.120 --> 15:04.480
this lecturing dad type ready to put someone in their place. He desperately wants to be seen as

15:04.480 --> 15:09.840
some kind of tough guy or authority figure, but it's not very convincing and it just reads as

15:09.840 --> 15:16.160
deeply insecure. Part of the problem of responding to a guy like this is it's very easy to get trapped

15:16.160 --> 15:20.880
in the endless corrections for all the lies he spreads, whether he's doing it knowingly or

15:20.880 --> 15:25.600
because he just doesn't understand. The one overriding impression though is that this guy

15:26.160 --> 15:30.960
is clearly not capable enough to be arguing in the position he's found himself in.

15:31.520 --> 15:36.240
The whole package of the Matt Walsh show is a sad one. He's a limited man,

15:36.240 --> 15:41.280
desperate to present himself as some kind of powerful voice. It raises the important question

15:41.280 --> 15:48.000
of how did this guy become as successful as he is? First we should probably ask though,

15:48.000 --> 15:53.920
was he always this bad? In a lengthy expose put together by Media Matters, a series of old clips

15:53.920 --> 15:59.360
from 2010 to 2011 revealed some commentary from Matt Walsh that display some of his more extreme

15:59.360 --> 16:00.400
positions.

16:29.360 --> 16:43.280
When this story broke, some people were shocked by the content and while it's certainly more

16:43.280 --> 16:48.480
masked off than his current stuff, you can see a lot of the patterns Walsh uses in the present day.

16:48.480 --> 16:53.040
In these old clips he makes vague gestures to the past while being completely historically

16:53.040 --> 16:57.440
illiterate and he's unable to engage with viewpoints that aren't his own. For example,

16:57.440 --> 17:02.240
in one of the longer clips when he's making a point about teenage pregnancy and marriage,

17:02.240 --> 17:06.560
he has very poor responses to his co-host who keeps raising the point of how difficult it is

17:06.560 --> 17:11.520
to avoid a family these days, these days being about 10 years ago. Not that it's gotten much

17:11.520 --> 17:17.120
better. Instead of actually engaging with this very valid point, Walsh goes on a rant about how

17:17.120 --> 17:21.680
college is useless and how people had the right idea 50 years ago and that 16 year olds are

17:21.680 --> 17:26.160
basically adults. None of that is true and none of it addresses the point that's being raised about

17:26.160 --> 17:30.640
the economics of bringing up a family today, especially if we're talking about a pregnant

17:30.640 --> 17:36.240
teenager. Never mind the social, personal, and physical burdens as well. But that's how Matt

17:36.240 --> 17:40.960
Walsh engages in any sort of debate. He has a specific idea of how things work in his head

17:40.960 --> 17:45.120
and he's not going to deviate from that no matter what evidence you show him or what arguments you

17:45.120 --> 17:50.720
bring to his face. He has an opinion set in stone that's often simple and poorly informed and he's

17:50.720 --> 17:55.440
not going to let anything change that. What these clips reveal is that Matt Walsh was making the same

17:55.520 --> 17:59.520
thoughtless, religiously tinted commentary throughout his career. This isn't a character

17:59.520 --> 18:04.960
he adopted a few years ago, this is just who this guy is. One of the keys to understanding this

18:04.960 --> 18:10.640
commentary is to know that Matt Walsh has a very specific kind of Christian worldview. He identifies

18:10.640 --> 18:15.600
as a Catholic and through that faith he interprets the world around him. While not all Christians or

18:15.600 --> 18:20.560
even all Catholics would share Walsh's vision of Christianity, he has found common cause among other

18:20.560 --> 18:26.080
Christian conservatives who support his faith-based arguments. When Walsh starts discussing politics

18:26.080 --> 18:31.040
it's through that Christian lens his worldview starts to make sense, specifically when he

18:31.040 --> 18:37.600
identifies liberalism as satanic. It is 2017 book, The Unholy Trinity, blocking the left's assault on

18:37.600 --> 18:43.840
life, marriage, and gender. It opens, the first liberal was named Lucifer. He elaborates on this

18:43.840 --> 18:49.360
a bit later, writing, this philosophy has propelled all the great villains throughout history.

18:49.440 --> 18:55.680
It is the philosophy of Judas, of Nero, of Genghis Khan, of Adolf Hitler, of Hillary Clinton.

18:55.680 --> 19:00.400
The specifics of what these people all believed and how they framed it around political circumstances

19:00.400 --> 19:05.440
of the day isn't terribly relevant, for they desired the same thing and worshipped the same

19:05.440 --> 19:11.520
god, the self. Walsh later claims that even the label of liberal or progressive are different

19:11.520 --> 19:18.160
reflections of that same deeper idea of self-worship, making this opposition to self-worship a very

19:18.160 --> 19:22.560
malleable thing. When Walsh writes about the political circumstances of the day not being

19:22.560 --> 19:27.280
terribly relevant, it's a convenient way of discarding any additional facts or circumstances

19:27.280 --> 19:31.840
that might complicate the point he's trying to make. A tactic you probably noticed earlier.

19:35.760 --> 19:41.200
This is just Matt Walsh's move. Ignore nuance, ignore complexity or depth, reduce everything to

19:41.200 --> 19:46.400
a simple talking point, and move on from there. To the point where Nero, Adolf Hitler, and Hillary

19:46.400 --> 19:51.920
Clinton are basically the same villain. Walsh certainly isn't an originator of this idea of

19:51.920 --> 19:57.120
self-worship, and it's a charge that any non-believers will probably recognize. It's this

19:57.120 --> 20:01.920
move of defining you not by what you believe, but what someone else says you're missing.

20:01.920 --> 20:06.320
In this case, worship of the god Matt Walsh believes in. It's a way of taking someone's

20:06.320 --> 20:12.000
arguments and beliefs away from them and instead placing them into an easily shaped strawman that

20:12.000 --> 20:17.280
can be more easily dispatched. It's a very lazy and dishonest way to frame somebody. And by the

20:17.280 --> 20:22.880
way, that god Matt Walsh believes in is not one shared by all Christians, at least according to

20:22.880 --> 20:28.560
him. In his 2020 book, Church of Cowards, a wake-up call to complacent Christians, he writes,

20:28.560 --> 20:35.440
Today, around 70% of Americans claim to be Christian. This number represents a marked decline,

20:35.440 --> 20:41.520
but the problem is not the decline in professed believers. If we had simply lost 10 or 20%,

20:42.480 --> 20:47.920
but still we had 70 who were really and truly on fire with the faith, there would be far less

20:47.920 --> 20:55.760
cause for concern. But the problem with the 70% is that it is not really 70%. The 70% is mostly

20:55.760 --> 21:00.800
composed of the sort of Christians who cannot be readily distinguished from atheists. He then

21:00.800 --> 21:05.040
decries how Christians in America have become too permissive and don't take their faith seriously

21:05.040 --> 21:09.520
enough. The book even opens with a hypothetical scenario of a group of heathens invading America

21:09.520 --> 21:13.040
and being shocked to find out it isn't the Christian nation they thought it was.

21:13.040 --> 21:18.560
One of the big crises Walsh sees is the lack of Christianity in America, the type of Christianity

21:18.560 --> 21:24.080
he espouses, particularly on issues that animate him. The three causes he mentions in Unholy

21:24.080 --> 21:29.920
Trinity are abortion, gay marriage, and transgender people. And he believes any real Christian would

21:29.920 --> 21:36.160
oppose all three things. He comes across as very strident and firm in his faith. But it's interesting

21:36.160 --> 21:41.760
to contrast how hard Walsh is against Christians he thinks don't measure up, compared to when he

21:41.760 --> 21:47.040
speaks to Ben Shapiro about religion. If you figure out how to love anyone outside of yourself

21:47.040 --> 21:52.640
during your life, then I think that's something God can take and work with. And those are little

21:52.640 --> 21:59.680
embers of something that he can ignite into fire in a good sense. Some important context here is

21:59.680 --> 22:05.120
that Shapiro is Jewish and Matt Walsh's boss, and you can see Walsh's tone become much softer,

22:05.120 --> 22:09.680
mumbling something vague about loving other people and giving God something to work with.

22:09.680 --> 22:13.840
What he and Shapiro really share is that they happen to be fighting the same enemy.

22:13.840 --> 22:18.800
This is how alliances are often forged in right-wing spaces, particularly at right-wing media.

22:18.800 --> 22:22.080
It's not about what you fight for, it's about what you fight against,

22:22.080 --> 22:26.720
and it's not about what you believe, it's about what you hate. That's not really enough to explain

22:26.800 --> 22:30.880
why Matt Walsh's profile has risen to the point where he's more well known than many other

22:30.880 --> 22:36.400
conservative commentary figures. While he's not at the level of Ben Shapiro or even Candace Owens,

22:36.400 --> 22:42.720
his name is probably more likely to be recognized than Andrew Clavin or Jake Crane or 75% of the

22:42.720 --> 22:48.080
lineup of Glenn Beck's Blaze TV, Walsh's former home. Matt Walsh's broader success can be easily

22:48.080 --> 22:53.200
understood by comparing him to one of his Daily Wire colleagues, the somehow even less talented

22:53.200 --> 22:57.520
Michael Knowles. If anyone knows who Michael Knowles is, it's because of comments he made

22:57.520 --> 23:03.440
back at CPAC in March of 2023 when he called for the eradication of transgenderism.

23:04.160 --> 23:12.320
Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely, the whole preposterous ideology

23:12.880 --> 23:18.880
at every level. This statement is a very clear example of getting as close as possible to calling

23:18.880 --> 23:24.320
for genocide without being explicit about it. The implication is clear though, to remove trans

23:24.320 --> 23:28.880
people from public life. It raises the obvious question of, what happens to the people who say

23:28.880 --> 23:34.240
being trans is a core part of their identity? The answer, at least looking at historical examples,

23:34.240 --> 23:39.520
tends to be murder or displacement. In other words, genocide. These comments are genocidal

23:39.520 --> 23:44.880
in character even if they aren't an explicit call for genocide. The grotesque nature of these

23:44.880 --> 23:50.160
comments aside, what this briefly did was tell the world that Michael Knowles exists. Looking at

23:50.160 --> 23:54.320
the headlines for this story we can see pretty clearly that most people weren't aware of who

23:54.320 --> 23:59.840
this guy was even though he had been hosting a show for the Daily Wire since 2017 at this point.

23:59.840 --> 24:05.120
CPAC's speaker calls for eradication of transgenderism and somehow claims he's not

24:05.120 --> 24:10.480
calling for elimination of transgender people. CPAC's speaker sparks alarm with call for

24:10.480 --> 24:17.840
transgenderism to be eradicated. CPAC's speaker calls for eradication of transgenderism. Crowd

24:17.840 --> 24:23.760
goes wild. As a fun aside, when I released my video on the Daily Wire's terror on the prairie,

24:23.760 --> 24:28.480
I put a black bar over Michael Knowles' face in the thumbnail to see if anyone would notice. I

24:28.480 --> 24:32.720
didn't see a single comment mention that. Michael Knowles has been trying to break through the noise

24:32.720 --> 24:37.280
of conservative commentary for years, and in spite of the financial resources behind him,

24:37.280 --> 24:41.920
he's had very little success. The only way he captured anyone's attention at all was to

24:41.920 --> 24:47.600
embrace genocidal rhetoric that had the thinnest layer of plausible deniability. This is how Matt

24:47.600 --> 24:53.600
Walsh did it too. Matt Walsh wasn't quite as brazen as Knowles, but he has similarly built a brand by

24:53.600 --> 24:57.760
demonizing trans people as much as possible, and looking at his history we can see this has been

24:57.760 --> 25:03.200
an issue he's been passionate about for years. And as we saw in the commentary I highlighted earlier,

25:03.200 --> 25:08.000
Matt Walsh is not a sophisticated operator but rather a true believer, so I don't think this

25:08.000 --> 25:13.280
is a simple grift. Instead, I think Matt Walsh is someone who is just lucky. To explain this,

25:13.280 --> 25:17.200
I have to zoom out a little bit though. There's a helpful tool we'll need to understand called

25:17.200 --> 25:22.240
the Overton Window. For those who are unfamiliar, that explains how political discourse exists on

25:22.240 --> 25:27.840
a spectrum that changes over time. What's left-wing today can become right-wing tomorrow and vice versa,

25:27.840 --> 25:32.640
depending on a population's general political leaning. The general political sentiments of a

25:32.640 --> 25:38.480
population are called the Overton Window. Anything outside that window is considered extreme.

25:38.480 --> 25:43.280
So if we're talking about the United States, this can usually be split along party lines,

25:43.280 --> 25:47.520
though it's possible to be further to the left or right in either party and still be part of

25:47.520 --> 25:53.520
mainstream political discourse. But if you go too far, say being an anarchist or an open white

25:53.520 --> 25:59.040
nationalist, you fall right out of the Overton Window and typically have your voice marginalized.

25:59.040 --> 26:03.200
This isn't a value judgment by the way, just a statement of how this window works.

26:03.200 --> 26:08.400
Anarchists are cool and interesting people. White nationalists are scum though, and I am judging

26:08.400 --> 26:13.520
them for being terrible. If I were to place Matt Walsh on this spectrum, we'd probably put him

26:13.520 --> 26:18.320
somewhere around here, particularly if we're talking about trans issues. And keep in mind,

26:18.320 --> 26:24.640
this is an image of commonly accepted political discourse, not personal feelings or subtext of the

26:24.800 --> 26:30.640
figure we're talking about. So dog whistles and masks, sadly, are in play, even if you're someone

26:30.640 --> 26:36.640
who can spot them. They work, and that's why people use them. And sadly, anti-trans rhetoric

26:36.640 --> 26:42.080
is broadly accepted on the right wing, so long as you aren't too obvious with the calls for genocide.

26:42.080 --> 26:47.200
You notice Matt Walsh is just on the side of acceptability when it comes to anti-trans rhetoric.

26:47.200 --> 26:52.400
He'll get pretty close to that line, making a lot of extreme statements, but he's savvy enough to

26:52.400 --> 26:56.960
couch it in a plausible deniability that keeps him from falling outside the Overton window of

26:56.960 --> 27:01.920
discourse. There are dozens of political commentators being bankrolled by millionaires and billionaires

27:01.920 --> 27:06.560
trying to influence the discourse. Most of them don't succeed because their talking points don't

27:06.560 --> 27:10.880
animate people enough. There are lots of reasons for this, and it varies from person to person,

27:10.880 --> 27:15.360
but the short version is that their particular niche doesn't animate enough of the base.

27:15.360 --> 27:20.400
Matt Walsh happened upon the anti-trans discord with his What is a Woman movie,

27:20.400 --> 27:25.040
even talking about trans people for years, but this key success made him the face of a major

27:25.040 --> 27:30.240
culture war issue. It's not just that he's anti-trans, but he's anti-trans in a way where he gets

27:30.240 --> 27:35.760
as close to the line as possible while appearing not to cross it. Matt Walsh's success exists

27:35.760 --> 27:41.120
entirely because of the moment he finds himself in, and getting very lucky with that movie.

27:41.120 --> 27:46.960
In this way, pushback against him ironically keeps him relevant. If the issue of trans people were

27:46.960 --> 27:51.520
a little more settled in people's minds and anti-trans sentiment were more commonplace,

27:51.520 --> 27:56.160
he would lose relevance and no one would care about him. And if it were less hospitable to

27:56.160 --> 28:02.080
be anti-trans publicly, then he would be shunned as a pariah and would similarly lose his position.

28:02.080 --> 28:07.760
He needs to be in this extreme position to have any sense of relevancy. And while he is relevant

28:07.760 --> 28:12.960
and popular, he could be used to animate the political base, which can be used to fuel

28:12.960 --> 28:17.840
political change. While the far right may not be in danger of going left, they sometimes need to

28:17.840 --> 28:22.560
be motivated to vote and organize for various causes, so they need to be riled up with hot

28:22.560 --> 28:27.760
button issues. This is what makes Matt Walsh valuable in the right-wing media space. It's not

28:27.760 --> 28:32.800
the value of his commentary being transformative, it's that he happens to hate the right people at

28:32.800 --> 28:38.400
the right time in the right way that can be used to mobilize political change. Or at least that's

28:38.400 --> 28:42.720
the assumption by the people who finance him. This is how Matt Walsh is useful. And just to

28:42.720 --> 28:48.080
be super clear, Matt Walsh didn't invent hating trans people. And in the grand scheme of things,

28:48.080 --> 28:52.080
his critiques are no more interesting or compelling than any other bigot. He just

28:52.080 --> 28:57.600
happened to come up with a catchy slogan for it. And he managed to stretch out that one-glib question

28:57.600 --> 29:02.240
into a movie. And that's how someone can make a lucrative career living just on the border of

29:02.240 --> 29:08.160
acceptable political discourse. In other words, Matt Walsh's immorality is incredibly lucky.

29:08.800 --> 29:13.280
Looking at the impact of anti-trans rhetoric, we can get a sense of the feelings Walsh is tapping

29:13.280 --> 29:17.680
into. Opinion polls regarding transgender people and trans issues varies quite a bit.

29:17.680 --> 29:23.200
In a recent Washington Post poll conducted with the KFF, they found anti-trans legislation was

29:23.200 --> 29:26.880
quite popular, particularly when it comes to certain types of gender affirming care for

29:26.880 --> 29:31.840
trans kids. An excerpt from that article reads, nearly seven in ten adults said they opposed

29:31.840 --> 29:36.240
allowing children ages 10 to 14 access to medication that stops the body from going

29:36.240 --> 29:41.200
through puberty and nearly six in ten oppose giving 15 to 17 year olds access to hormone

29:41.200 --> 29:46.080
therapy. There was, however, majority support for gender affirming counseling or therapy,

29:46.080 --> 29:50.960
with more than six in ten supporting this for both age groups. But looking at other polling,

29:50.960 --> 29:56.320
for instance, a poll conducted by PBS NewsHour shows different results. In this case, the question

29:56.320 --> 30:00.960
being asked is, do you support legislation that criminalizes providing gender affirming care for

30:00.960 --> 30:06.960
minors? The results in this poll was that 54% opposed the bans while 43% supported them.

30:06.960 --> 30:11.280
This comparison was made in an article for The Stranger by Alex Corin, a journalist and

30:11.280 --> 30:17.120
researcher on transphobia. She highlighted how this poll from the Post and KFF suffers from issues

30:17.120 --> 30:23.200
similar to polls on abortion, how questions are asked on polls matter and results shift accordingly.

30:23.200 --> 30:28.160
She brings up another point of comparison. In a Mason Dixon poll in Kentucky, there was an even

30:28.160 --> 30:32.880
more pronounced result when it was asked, would you support or oppose a proposed Kentucky law

30:32.880 --> 30:37.680
that would allow the state to overrule parents' decision to obtain certain health care for their

30:37.680 --> 30:43.520
transgender teenager, such as certain medications that can regulate the onset of puberty? In this

30:43.520 --> 30:50.480
case, 71% opposed the legislation and 21% supported it. As Corin describes in her article, rather than

30:50.480 --> 30:55.200
just throw certain polls out in hold of the ones we want, looking at all of this information reveals

30:55.200 --> 31:00.880
to us that what matters to people is who decides in these issues. While people may oppose certain

31:00.880 --> 31:05.760
types of gender affirming care personally, that does not necessarily reveal any desire for the

31:05.760 --> 31:09.760
state to intervene and prevent parents from deciding what's best for their child. And there

31:09.760 --> 31:15.040
are still more polls that reveal a general fatigue over trans issues being emphasized in political

31:15.040 --> 31:20.640
discourse. Here's an excerpt from the website Roll Call about one recent poll from Data for

31:20.640 --> 31:25.280
Progress. When asked about the more than 400 pieces of legislation working their way through

31:25.280 --> 31:30.080
state houses aimed at limiting the rights of transgender and gay people in America,

31:30.080 --> 31:35.680
64% of respondents, including 55% of Republicans, sided with the statement,

31:35.680 --> 31:40.320
this is too much legislation, politicians are playing political theater, and using these

31:40.320 --> 31:45.520
bills as a wedge issue. Compared with 25% who agreed with the statement, this is the right

31:45.520 --> 31:49.760
amount of legislation, politicians are dealing with a real danger that needs to be addressed.

31:50.640 --> 31:56.720
This figure rose to 78% among respondents who know a transgender person. And that last part is

31:56.720 --> 32:00.880
especially interesting because just knowing a transgender person seems to have a dramatic

32:00.880 --> 32:05.440
impact in all polling for supporting transgender people in general, and also underscores the

32:05.440 --> 32:10.480
importance of representation. Seeing who these people are and the struggles they go with creates

32:10.480 --> 32:14.960
greater degrees of sympathy and support. Other results show that the younger generation is

32:14.960 --> 32:19.360
generally pro-trans rights, with some predicting a massive change on the topic within 10 years.

32:19.920 --> 32:24.720
All that said, it's also true that many people are still ignorant regarding trans issues,

32:24.720 --> 32:29.360
and remain susceptible to messengers like Walsh. That's part of what makes him particularly

32:29.360 --> 32:34.080
valuable. One funny thing I noticed while watching Matt Walsh was he often fought back against other

32:34.080 --> 32:39.200
figures on the right when they would criticize an emphasis on the culture wars. Okay, understand

32:39.200 --> 32:44.240
this, if you are doing this whole focus on the economy, not the culture war thing, you are

32:44.240 --> 32:50.960
repeating the same talking point that the GOP establishment has used for 40 years. It's because

32:50.960 --> 32:55.040
the Republican Party, who are supposed to be ostensibly the leaders of the conservative

32:55.040 --> 32:59.440
movement for decades now, they've been saying the culture doesn't matter, all that matters is the

32:59.440 --> 33:03.840
economy and foreign policy, let's worry about that. And so they surrendered the culture to the left,

33:03.840 --> 33:10.080
and now here we are. The defensiveness and lack of historical literacy here is pretty funny. The

33:10.080 --> 33:14.000
right has been harping about culture war issues for decades. They brought them up with gay

33:14.000 --> 33:18.720
marriage, prayer in school, and all sorts of religiously themed topics I would assume Matt

33:18.720 --> 33:23.280
Walsh would know something about. Obviously what Matt Walsh is concerned with here is

33:23.280 --> 33:28.640
sliding into political relevancy. Without the culture wars and specifically anti-trans rhetoric,

33:28.640 --> 33:33.200
no one would care about what this guy has to say, so he has to cling on to it for dear life.

33:33.200 --> 33:36.480
But the reason there's a pushback against culture war issues by the right,

33:36.480 --> 33:41.040
at least when it comes to trans issues, is that it's a very poor political performer.

33:41.040 --> 33:46.560
In a sub-stacked post from a user named Ettingermentum titled The Modern Electoral History of

33:46.560 --> 33:51.120
Transphobia, we get a lengthy breakdown in how many times transphobia has failed at the ballot

33:51.120 --> 33:56.960
box in the United States, most recently in the 2022 midterm elections. What much of the polling

33:56.960 --> 34:01.120
highlighted early in this video fails to capture, and something I wish people would understand

34:01.120 --> 34:05.680
broadly about any opinion poll, is that just because someone feels a way about an issue

34:05.680 --> 34:10.160
doesn't mean that that issue will influence how they vote, or how they'll even politically

34:10.160 --> 34:15.440
organize. For example, if ketchup had a 90% approval rating and a politician said they were

34:15.440 --> 34:20.560
going to ban it, it probably wouldn't influence the election if voters were convinced that that

34:20.560 --> 34:25.760
same politician had a plan that would revitalize the economy for working people. Issues like the

34:25.760 --> 34:30.800
economy are far more important in elections than what you put on your french fries. But that speaks

34:30.800 --> 34:35.120
to something that Ettingermentum brings up in their article. Here's an excerpt.

34:35.120 --> 34:39.920
While general public apathy towards the issue means that voters are exceedingly unlikely

34:40.000 --> 34:46.400
to vote for republicans because of anti-trans messaging, as has been extensively demonstrated,

34:46.400 --> 34:52.320
it also means that politicians who pass anti-trans laws are not likely to face significant electoral

34:52.320 --> 34:57.440
pushback over it. And that would explain why so many anti-trans laws are being passed in

34:57.440 --> 35:02.880
red states with limited pushback. People are generally not motivated by transphobia,

35:02.880 --> 35:07.520
whether it's to take part of the transphobia or to stand against it. And while that's great for

35:07.520 --> 35:13.280
the former, it's tragic for the latter. These are issues that people should want to take a stand for,

35:13.280 --> 35:19.280
to stand up for the humanity of people. And the saddest part of these polls are the people who

35:19.280 --> 35:25.120
just seem willing to not care. And so even if someone like Bat Walsh has limited appeal,

35:25.120 --> 35:29.200
it's important for people to know what sort of hate a goal like this is spreading because even

35:29.200 --> 35:33.360
if it won't swing a federal election, it's still something that impacts any transgender person

35:33.360 --> 35:38.320
living in a red state or any transgender person more broadly who's been a victim of harassment

35:38.320 --> 35:43.280
or a hate crime. If anti-trans legislation isn't going to move the needle electorally, it does raise

35:43.280 --> 35:48.240
the question of why do it at all. And the answer seems to be, according to Antony Grementum,

35:48.240 --> 35:53.520
is that some of these people are just true believers. Here's another excerpt from the article.

35:53.520 --> 35:58.480
Much like the old demographics as destiny theory that captured the Democratic Party in the 2000s

35:58.560 --> 36:06.640
and 2010s, anti-trans or more broadly anti-woke lore is the right kind of story for the right

36:06.640 --> 36:12.800
political class at just the right time. I swear, I thought of using that phrase to describe Bat

36:12.800 --> 36:17.280
Walsh before reading this article, but it does speak to how his success really is a product of

36:17.280 --> 36:22.560
very fortunate timing. And while a lot of this is being presented in this video as how it impacts

36:22.560 --> 36:27.200
electoral politics, I do want to stress there are many other real threats impacting transgender

36:27.200 --> 36:32.640
people outside of legislation. The frightening number of hate crimes, including murder, is fostered

36:32.640 --> 36:38.240
by anti-trans render spread by the likes of Walsh. I'm not entirely sure he's savvy enough to be aware

36:38.240 --> 36:44.000
that his hobby horse has no real electoral heft, but if he is, that's even worse, because instead

36:44.000 --> 36:48.320
of being a willing tool of the right-wing media ecosystem that serves as a PR wing for the

36:48.320 --> 36:53.600
Republican Party, he's instead using this platform he's lucked into to make as much money as he can

36:53.600 --> 36:58.160
while spreading hatred that actively harms transgender people. There is a bit of a silver

36:58.160 --> 37:03.600
lining here in that one-trick ponies rarely have any staying power. While transphobia will be a

37:03.600 --> 37:08.640
long-term struggle, the fight against mediocre bigots like Matt Walsh probably won't be as long.

37:09.200 --> 37:13.280
So the whole point of this video, I guess, is to remind everyone that the fight for trans rights

37:13.280 --> 37:18.560
is about more than this guy, and while it's important to oppose him, the real problem is

37:18.560 --> 37:23.440
the moment we find ourselves in when trans people are continuously under threat. Going back to the

37:23.440 --> 37:28.560
point I mentioned earlier, most people aren't motivated by trans issues. Not caring is perfectly

37:28.560 --> 37:33.040
fine in a better world, letting people live how they choose without making your business is a very

37:33.040 --> 37:37.840
good and valid position. But right now we live in a world that's hostile to trans people, and that

37:37.840 --> 37:43.360
threat is multiplied for a number of intersectional identities. So it's not just trans men and trans

37:43.360 --> 37:48.320
women who are under threat, but also non-binary people, transgender people who are POCs or have

37:48.320 --> 37:52.960
disabilities, or just any transgender person who might need somebody to fight alongside them.

37:52.960 --> 37:58.080
So I guess the message I hope you all take away from this is that, when fighting for the rights

37:58.080 --> 38:02.560
of others, it's less about fighting against a certain man and more about fighting in a certain

38:02.560 --> 38:08.320
moment. A big thanks to all the trans creators who blended their voice to this video. I hope

38:08.320 --> 38:13.120
you all check out their channels listed below. Once upon a time, I told myself I would never

38:13.120 --> 38:19.680
make a video discussing Matt Walsh because he is so boring and untalented and inconsequential.

38:20.400 --> 38:25.040
Sadly, things have changed to the point where he actually is worth some attention and some

38:25.040 --> 38:29.760
pushback, though hopefully this video contextualized him in a way that reveals he's not so big and

38:29.760 --> 38:35.440
scary as he poses he's just a lucky dude who happened upon a lucrative career hating the right

38:35.440 --> 38:41.360
people. That's something to keep in mind for others of his ilk in the future. Although a year

38:41.360 --> 38:46.480
from now I find myself making a video about Michael Knowles, someone get a wellness check

38:46.480 --> 38:52.720
ready because I will be very, very sad that I have to even discuss that loser. If you would
