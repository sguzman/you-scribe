1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
Matt Walsh is not an interesting guy. His talking points are poorly evidenced and infantile,

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,000
his delivery is flat and lacking in charisma, and the subjects he covers reveal an embarrassingly

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,600
narrow perspective of the world. But he is incredibly lucky, and that's the secret to

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:23,440
his success. Matt Walsh matters insofar that he serves as an object lesson on how right-wing

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:28,800
media figures continuously push on the limits of acceptable discourse to direct society backwards

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,200
into a regressive state that strips away the rights of people to create a religiously centered

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,560
culture. This kind of extreme Christian conservatism has been going on for a long time, and it's

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:44,480
important to continuously oppose. But Matt Walsh himself? He's mediocre at best. There are a lot

9
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,040
of other people doing the same thing and often much better than he is, but why is he someone

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,360
people suddenly have to care about? Let's do a quick rundown of this guy's history if you're not

11
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,840
familiar with him. Originally a radio host in Delaware, Walsh bounced around from a few jobs

12
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,880
struggling to last for more than a year or two. He started a blog in 2012, eventually catching

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,800
the attention of Glenn Beck's The Blaze in 2014. In 2017 he started writing for Ben Shapiro's The

14
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:15,520
Daily Wire, and he got his own show, The Matt Walsh Show, in 2018. But it wasn't until 2022 that he

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:20,640
really started catching people's eye, notably with his anti-trans movie What is a Woman.

16
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,520
As his biggest success by far, it would be weird not to mention it, but I'm not going to go too

17
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,640
into depth on this particular movie because it's been thoroughly debunked by other people on YouTube.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,960
So if you want a detailed breakdown, I would recommend Jessie Jender's videos on the subject.

19
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,320
She goes into great detail on why this movie is a little propaganda. But we do at least have to

20
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,960
address what kind of content he puts out there, so instead I'm going to take a look at what it's

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,200
like to watch his show. The Matt Walsh Show has a basic formula. He has one story he speaks to for

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,920
the first 15 to 20 minutes of the show, then a series of five headlines he gives a couple of

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,600
minutes to, then he responds to viewer comments, and finally one last story to cap off the episode.

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,080
Although it's segmented to give the show the appearance of variety, the only real difference

25
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,040
is the length of each segment as pretty much all of it is just Walsh commenting on a piece of news

26
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,240
or another commentary. The first thing I noticed while watching is that, even for the big stories

27
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:22,480
up front, Matt Walsh very rarely goes into detail about any subject he's supposedly commenting on.

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,280
This is particularly obvious when he discusses trans issues, something he typically touches

29
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:34,240
on several times in episode. In one episode, from May 2nd, 2023 titled Princeton Professor

30
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:42,240
Tries to Debunk Biology Fails Hilariously, episode 1156, my god he's done a lot of these,

31
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,160
Walsh responds to an article published on the Scientific American website.

32
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,000
For some context before we jump in, this article is titled Here's Why Human Sex is Not Binary,

33
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,880
Over the Don't Make a Woman, and Sperm Don't Make a Man by Augustin Fuentes, a professor of

34
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,800
anthropology at Princeton University. This article is a response to how the emphasis is often placed

35
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,280
on how people are assigned male or female at birth on the basis of whether they produce

36
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,800
sperm or ova. He provides a few examples of people reducing sex to one of those two things,

37
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:17,520
and then explains with more examples and commentary from various scientific sources

38
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:22,560
how the many complications of human sex make it difficult to place it in a binary.

39
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,400
Here's an excerpt from the article that sums it up well. When someone states that

40
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,320
quote, an organism's sex is defined by the type of gamete, sperm, or ova it has the function of

41
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:38,960
producing, unquote, and argues that legal and social policy should be quote, rooted in properties

42
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:45,120
of bodies, unquote, they are not really talking about gametes and sex biology. They are arguing

43
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,000
for a specific political and discriminatory definition of what is quote unquote natural

44
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,720
and quote unquote right for humans based on a false representation of biology.

45
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,120
And he gives several historical examples of what that discrimination has often looked like.

46
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,240
It's a pretty good article that offers a primary for why sex shouldn't be understood as a binary

47
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,720
and focuses on how sex is used by political actors to discriminate against others.

48
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,720
Matt Walsh is not so kind in his assessment of the article. What's most noticeable in his analysis

49
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,000
though is how shallow his reading of the article is. Here's how he starts a segment. Starting at

50
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
the top of the article says, there are those politicians, pundits, and even a few scientists

51
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,960
who maintain that whether our bodies make ova or sperm are all we need to know about sex.

52
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:38,080
We already see the game that he's playing. The headline promises proof that human sex is not

53
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:44,080
binary. This is a big promise. But then in the first sentence, Professor Fuentes sets himself up

54
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:51,520
for a very different and much smaller task. It's weird that Matt Walsh is calling the first sentence

55
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,560
some kind of sleight of hand when it was clear what the article was about from the subheading.

56
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
Though that part of the article is never shown or read during this segment, just the broad headline

57
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,080
up top. Kind of be like talking about the Star Wars movies without including their subheadings.

58
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,840
It kind of is important to differentiate them and give you a little more context of what's being

59
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,400
discussed, but instead we're getting context removed so Matt Walsh can more easily make his

60
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,040
point. You really get the impression he either has it read or is deliberately ignoring certain

61
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,840
parts of this article. Here's some more evidence of that. He announces his intention to respond to

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:30,400
the claim that whether our bodies make ova or sperm are all we need to know about sex, except

63
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,160
that, well, nobody ever said that ova and sperm are all we need to know about sex. If you read the

64
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,040
original Scientific American article, you can see he's linked several examples of people saying

65
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:44,880
just that. Not that you have to go anywhere else because you can see Walsh do a version of it

66
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,280
himself less than a minute later. He's not actually, it looks like we're disproving it,

67
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:55,360
he's just adding on other details. But even if those other details are true, that wouldn't

68
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:01,040
disprove the basic fact that there are only male and female gametes, which means that there are

69
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:07,040
only two sexes, which means that sex is binary. Reading the article, Professor Fuentes clarifies

70
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,960
that when someone, like Matt Walsh, claims there are other factors, they never seem to explain

71
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,720
anything beyond genitals and gametes. This video is just another case of that. We're told there are

72
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,120
other factors, but never what those factors actually are. Seems like it would be a really

73
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:28,880
good time to bring them up, but we just don't get them here. The segment is exhausting in that it's

74
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:33,520
more or less Walsh going through the article, reading lengthy excerpts, and reacting to them,

75
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,400
but each time he misses crucial context that would either change or complicate what he's trying to

76
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,000
respond to. He'll complain that the article is just making empty assertions, apparently unaware

77
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:49,200
that in the original you can see it links to many sources, several from peer-reviewed journals. It

78
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:53,120
actually assembles quite a bit of evidence to support each claim that's being made. Not that

79
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,680
you could ever tell from the Walsh segment, since the excerpts are just displayed as text and you

80
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,400
can't really tell, they're linking to a lot of supporting information. Throughout this entire

81
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,720
segment, Matt Walsh doesn't cite a single source. He just makes a vague allusion to the science.

82
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,280
This is a pattern of his. The challenge in responding to so much of what Matt Walsh says

83
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,640
is that he not only doesn't understand what he's responding to, whether that's deliberate or not,

84
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:24,320
he also refuses to do any homework. If someone cites scientific research that counters his claim,

85
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:28,240
he just doesn't acknowledge it. Walsh smugly argues at the end,

86
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:37,200
Variations within a category do not invalidate the category. Males need to exist as a category

87
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,240
in order for us to say anything about a male, a human male, such as human males are all different,

88
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,840
they have different expressions. This article is not arguing that categories within sex don't exist.

89
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:53,920
Categories do exist within a spectrum. When a scientist says light is a spectrum, for instance,

90
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,880
they're not saying that colors don't exist, just that the boundaries between colors are not so clear

91
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:04,400
cut as they would be in a binary. And Walsh doesn't even seem to understand the basic point of this

92
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,840
article. It's not about upending some kind of scientific consensus that he's imagined. It's

93
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:15,360
using established science to talk about how that science is politicized. And Matt Walsh is doing

94
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,480
that politicizing in this very video. He's not engaging with any of the material in a meaningful

95
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:26,400
sense, he's just twisting it to meet his own ends. This is what Walsh's content often boils down to,

96
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,240
butchering evidence to make a hateful point. In the May 3rd, 2023 episode of his show,

97
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:39,120
others of trans kids give insane reasons for transitioning their children, episode 1157,

98
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,600
we get all of that ignorance distilled into one of Matt Walsh's favorite rhetorical moves.

99
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,760
But we don't even need to talk about the science, because it's also logically fallacious. It doesn't

100
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,160
make any logical sense. Of all the episodes I watched while researching this video,

101
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,800
he never gets around to talking about the science. He would rather fixate on the simplified language

102
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,520
of activists than actually dive into the science he's supposedly defending. And that's how he

103
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,120
operates on most topics. In another episode, the left demands we surrender our families and

104
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:13,040
communities to violent criminals, episode 1159. He describes a story where a trans man,

105
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:18,560
Brown, in San Francisco was shot and killed by armed security outside of Walgreens after Brown

106
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:24,400
was suspected of shoplifting. Since no charges were filed and Brown was trans and black,

107
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,640
and since this happened in San Francisco, Matt Walsh believes we don't need to look at the actual

108
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,200
details of this case. As we know, the official legal bar for self-defense is set at a certain

109
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:40,960
height. But the unofficial bar for self-defense against someone who belongs to three different

110
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,720
victim classes is set significantly higher. And this security guard apparently cleared both the

111
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,960
official bar and the unofficial bar, which is all we really need to know about the case.

112
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,160
He mentions three victim classes in this clip because he's also misgendering Brown. Actually,

113
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,960
looking at the details of this case reveals some interesting facts, such as Brown was alleged to

114
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:05,920
have threatened to stab the security guard, yet no knife was recovered at the scene. And Walsh's

115
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,080
commentary completely ignores that the fact that this killing has raised an interesting question

116
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,600
about armed security being used at a drugstore. We can see Walsh lie about this in real time as he

117
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,200
describes the activists. That's why activists in San Francisco are now calling for the abolition

118
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,320
of security guards in response to this incident. Activists aren't calling for the elimination of

119
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:31,040
security guards, though. We can see that in the article Walsh himself is reading out. It's very

120
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,760
explicit about it being armed security that they're concerned about. Instead of dealing

121
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,760
with the points being raised by activists, Walsh would sooner misrepresent them so he can say stuff

122
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:49,360
like this. Stealing isn't worth the cost of human life. So don't steal. Walsh then goes on to make

123
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,920
a painfully simplistic argument about the need to defend property with lethal force, which includes

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,840
anything you might get from a Walgreens. It's a very bad and silly point on the face of it.

125
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:04,880
If you need a YouTuber to explain why someone shouldn't be executed on the spot for stealing

126
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,120
loaf of bread or even, as Walsh at one point speculates, some fancy headphones, then you have

127
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,200
a perspective on life that I don't think is going to be changed by a single YouTube video. Here's

128
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,840
some more criminal justice reform ideas from Walsh. This time it's regarding the death penalty for

129
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,040
pedophiles. Not only are we executing these people, but we're doing it quickly. We're not giving them

130
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,440
30 years to appeal, okay? The conviction is passed down, you're convicted, you're guilty, you've been

131
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:40,560
found guilty, and then the execution is carried out the next day. Take them up, take them out to

132
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,200
the gallows, you bring them up on the platform, you tie a rope around their neck, pull the lever,

133
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,400
boom, it's done. Walsh concocts this whole imaginary scenario that, I'm sure in his mind,

134
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,960
makes perfect sense. In the real world though, death sentences are highly contested because

135
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,440
many of them are overturned. For example, the Innocence Project specializes in overturning

136
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,600
wrongful convictions through more modern investigative techniques, and many others

137
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,760
sentenced to death have had those convictions overturned when new evidences discovered.

138
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,200
Walsh's fantasy leaves no room for that and would mean innocent people would die. It also has this

139
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:18,800
assumption that the justice system is perfect, which is just not true. Even on the point of a

140
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,760
hanging being quick and effective, the reason hangings were stopped was because they often aren't.

141
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,960
A botched hanging results in someone being slowly strangled to death. It's a struggle to describe

142
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,160
Walsh's arguments as anything more than childish and lazy. He's very good at finding a way to never

143
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:39,040
think deeply about any of the topics he covers. Why cite scientific research when you can simply

144
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:44,400
make a reference to the science? Why honestly debate what activists are saying when you can

145
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:49,760
create a simpler strawman to rail against instead? Why genuinely consider how the death penalty is

146
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:55,200
applied when you can instead make up an imaginary scenario that is completely divorced from reality?

147
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Poor arguments framed by missing context are all his show is though. He does devote a lot of

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,120
time to creating bait. This is usually in the shape of having an over-the-top reaction about

149
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:10,240
trivial things. For example, calling people savages if they let their pets sleep in the same bed.

150
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,760
He also describes adults who like Disney World as mentally ill and he hates bicycle lanes.

151
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:25,680
It's here his commentary is more obviously laid bare as the trolling it so often is. And what

152
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,560
makes it effective is that it's hard to tell apart from his more serious commentary. They're

153
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,080
similarly poorly argued and often based on Walsh's gut feelings about something and he's needlessly

154
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,720
confrontational about everything he says. It would be nice if he were just a silly guy we could

155
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:46,080
afford to ignore, crying about people who let their pets sleep on the bed, using his pathetic

156
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:51,040
bait to get media watchdogs and other commentators like myself to address him like he's someone

157
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,400
worth considering. And if that was all he was, I wouldn't waste time talking about him in a video

158
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:01,280
like this one. Instead, I think it's important to acknowledge this bait because it reflects the

159
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,720
soft nature of all his news commentary and there are aspects of that commentary that are genuinely

160
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:12,240
harmful. The bait and the harmful commentary are similar in that none of it is very substantial

161
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,080
and whenever it approaches any subject that has any complexity whatsoever, for example gender,

162
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,120
all that nuance and complexity gets wiped away so Matt Walsh can comment on it at his own level.

163
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,400
And as embarrassing as all of this is, the saddest part of the show is when he starts arguing with

164
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,840
YouTube comments. And at Accretionist says, yes, respecting LGBT people is difficult for you and

165
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:41,200
asking for that respect is brainwashing. We understand witless sadism, Matt. Well, I'm sure

166
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:47,280
you do. Or what he calls on his audience to harass Dwayne Wade. Dwayne Wade everywhere he

167
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:53,520
goes should be jeered and mocked and shouted at everywhere he goes. That should happen.

168
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:59,120
And there are so many other examples where Matt Walsh just seems determined to come off as like

169
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:04,480
this lecturing dad type ready to put someone in their place. He desperately wants to be seen as

170
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,840
some kind of tough guy or authority figure, but it's not very convincing and it just reads as

171
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,160
deeply insecure. Part of the problem of responding to a guy like this is it's very easy to get trapped

172
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,880
in the endless corrections for all the lies he spreads, whether he's doing it knowingly or

173
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:25,600
because he just doesn't understand. The one overriding impression though is that this guy

174
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,960
is clearly not capable enough to be arguing in the position he's found himself in.

175
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,240
The whole package of the Matt Walsh show is a sad one. He's a limited man,

176
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,280
desperate to present himself as some kind of powerful voice. It raises the important question

177
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:48,000
of how did this guy become as successful as he is? First we should probably ask though,

178
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,920
was he always this bad? In a lengthy expose put together by Media Matters, a series of old clips

179
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,360
from 2010 to 2011 revealed some commentary from Matt Walsh that display some of his more extreme

180
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,400
positions.

181
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:43,280
When this story broke, some people were shocked by the content and while it's certainly more

182
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,480
masked off than his current stuff, you can see a lot of the patterns Walsh uses in the present day.

183
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,040
In these old clips he makes vague gestures to the past while being completely historically

184
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,440
illiterate and he's unable to engage with viewpoints that aren't his own. For example,

185
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,240
in one of the longer clips when he's making a point about teenage pregnancy and marriage,

186
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,560
he has very poor responses to his co-host who keeps raising the point of how difficult it is

187
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,520
to avoid a family these days, these days being about 10 years ago. Not that it's gotten much

188
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,120
better. Instead of actually engaging with this very valid point, Walsh goes on a rant about how

189
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:21,680
college is useless and how people had the right idea 50 years ago and that 16 year olds are

190
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,160
basically adults. None of that is true and none of it addresses the point that's being raised about

191
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,640
the economics of bringing up a family today, especially if we're talking about a pregnant

192
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,240
teenager. Never mind the social, personal, and physical burdens as well. But that's how Matt

193
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,960
Walsh engages in any sort of debate. He has a specific idea of how things work in his head

194
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,120
and he's not going to deviate from that no matter what evidence you show him or what arguments you

195
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,720
bring to his face. He has an opinion set in stone that's often simple and poorly informed and he's

196
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,440
not going to let anything change that. What these clips reveal is that Matt Walsh was making the same

197
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,520
thoughtless, religiously tinted commentary throughout his career. This isn't a character

198
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,960
he adopted a few years ago, this is just who this guy is. One of the keys to understanding this

199
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:10,640
commentary is to know that Matt Walsh has a very specific kind of Christian worldview. He identifies

200
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,600
as a Catholic and through that faith he interprets the world around him. While not all Christians or

201
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:20,560
even all Catholics would share Walsh's vision of Christianity, he has found common cause among other

202
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,080
Christian conservatives who support his faith-based arguments. When Walsh starts discussing politics

203
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,040
it's through that Christian lens his worldview starts to make sense, specifically when he

204
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:37,600
identifies liberalism as satanic. It is 2017 book, The Unholy Trinity, blocking the left's assault on

205
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,840
life, marriage, and gender. It opens, the first liberal was named Lucifer. He elaborates on this

206
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:49,360
a bit later, writing, this philosophy has propelled all the great villains throughout history.

207
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:55,680
It is the philosophy of Judas, of Nero, of Genghis Khan, of Adolf Hitler, of Hillary Clinton.

208
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,400
The specifics of what these people all believed and how they framed it around political circumstances

209
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,440
of the day isn't terribly relevant, for they desired the same thing and worshipped the same

210
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:11,520
god, the self. Walsh later claims that even the label of liberal or progressive are different

211
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,160
reflections of that same deeper idea of self-worship, making this opposition to self-worship a very

212
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,560
malleable thing. When Walsh writes about the political circumstances of the day not being

213
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,280
terribly relevant, it's a convenient way of discarding any additional facts or circumstances

214
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,840
that might complicate the point he's trying to make. A tactic you probably noticed earlier.

215
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,200
This is just Matt Walsh's move. Ignore nuance, ignore complexity or depth, reduce everything to

216
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,400
a simple talking point, and move on from there. To the point where Nero, Adolf Hitler, and Hillary

217
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,920
Clinton are basically the same villain. Walsh certainly isn't an originator of this idea of

218
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:57,120
self-worship, and it's a charge that any non-believers will probably recognize. It's this

219
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,920
move of defining you not by what you believe, but what someone else says you're missing.

220
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,320
In this case, worship of the god Matt Walsh believes in. It's a way of taking someone's

221
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,000
arguments and beliefs away from them and instead placing them into an easily shaped strawman that

222
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,280
can be more easily dispatched. It's a very lazy and dishonest way to frame somebody. And by the

223
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:22,880
way, that god Matt Walsh believes in is not one shared by all Christians, at least according to

224
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:28,560
him. In his 2020 book, Church of Cowards, a wake-up call to complacent Christians, he writes,

225
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:35,440
Today, around 70% of Americans claim to be Christian. This number represents a marked decline,

226
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:41,520
but the problem is not the decline in professed believers. If we had simply lost 10 or 20%,

227
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:47,920
but still we had 70 who were really and truly on fire with the faith, there would be far less

228
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:55,760
cause for concern. But the problem with the 70% is that it is not really 70%. The 70% is mostly

229
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,800
composed of the sort of Christians who cannot be readily distinguished from atheists. He then

230
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,040
decries how Christians in America have become too permissive and don't take their faith seriously

231
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,520
enough. The book even opens with a hypothetical scenario of a group of heathens invading America

232
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:13,040
and being shocked to find out it isn't the Christian nation they thought it was.

233
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:18,560
One of the big crises Walsh sees is the lack of Christianity in America, the type of Christianity

234
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:24,080
he espouses, particularly on issues that animate him. The three causes he mentions in Unholy

235
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:29,920
Trinity are abortion, gay marriage, and transgender people. And he believes any real Christian would

236
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:36,160
oppose all three things. He comes across as very strident and firm in his faith. But it's interesting

237
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:41,760
to contrast how hard Walsh is against Christians he thinks don't measure up, compared to when he

238
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,040
speaks to Ben Shapiro about religion. If you figure out how to love anyone outside of yourself

239
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:52,640
during your life, then I think that's something God can take and work with. And those are little

240
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:59,680
embers of something that he can ignite into fire in a good sense. Some important context here is

241
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,120
that Shapiro is Jewish and Matt Walsh's boss, and you can see Walsh's tone become much softer,

242
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,680
mumbling something vague about loving other people and giving God something to work with.

243
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:13,840
What he and Shapiro really share is that they happen to be fighting the same enemy.

244
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,800
This is how alliances are often forged in right-wing spaces, particularly at right-wing media.

245
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,080
It's not about what you fight for, it's about what you fight against,

246
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:26,720
and it's not about what you believe, it's about what you hate. That's not really enough to explain

247
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:30,880
why Matt Walsh's profile has risen to the point where he's more well known than many other

248
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:36,400
conservative commentary figures. While he's not at the level of Ben Shapiro or even Candace Owens,

249
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,720
his name is probably more likely to be recognized than Andrew Clavin or Jake Crane or 75% of the

250
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,080
lineup of Glenn Beck's Blaze TV, Walsh's former home. Matt Walsh's broader success can be easily

251
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:53,200
understood by comparing him to one of his Daily Wire colleagues, the somehow even less talented

252
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,520
Michael Knowles. If anyone knows who Michael Knowles is, it's because of comments he made

253
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,440
back at CPAC in March of 2023 when he called for the eradication of transgenderism.

254
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:12,320
Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely, the whole preposterous ideology

255
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,880
at every level. This statement is a very clear example of getting as close as possible to calling

256
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,320
for genocide without being explicit about it. The implication is clear though, to remove trans

257
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,880
people from public life. It raises the obvious question of, what happens to the people who say

258
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,240
being trans is a core part of their identity? The answer, at least looking at historical examples,

259
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,520
tends to be murder or displacement. In other words, genocide. These comments are genocidal

260
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,880
in character even if they aren't an explicit call for genocide. The grotesque nature of these

261
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:50,160
comments aside, what this briefly did was tell the world that Michael Knowles exists. Looking at

262
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:54,320
the headlines for this story we can see pretty clearly that most people weren't aware of who

263
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,840
this guy was even though he had been hosting a show for the Daily Wire since 2017 at this point.

264
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:05,120
CPAC's speaker calls for eradication of transgenderism and somehow claims he's not

265
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,480
calling for elimination of transgender people. CPAC's speaker sparks alarm with call for

266
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,840
transgenderism to be eradicated. CPAC's speaker calls for eradication of transgenderism. Crowd

267
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:23,760
goes wild. As a fun aside, when I released my video on the Daily Wire's terror on the prairie,

268
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,480
I put a black bar over Michael Knowles' face in the thumbnail to see if anyone would notice. I

269
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,720
didn't see a single comment mention that. Michael Knowles has been trying to break through the noise

270
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,280
of conservative commentary for years, and in spite of the financial resources behind him,

271
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:41,920
he's had very little success. The only way he captured anyone's attention at all was to

272
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:47,600
embrace genocidal rhetoric that had the thinnest layer of plausible deniability. This is how Matt

273
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:53,600
Walsh did it too. Matt Walsh wasn't quite as brazen as Knowles, but he has similarly built a brand by

274
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,760
demonizing trans people as much as possible, and looking at his history we can see this has been

275
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:03,200
an issue he's been passionate about for years. And as we saw in the commentary I highlighted earlier,

276
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,000
Matt Walsh is not a sophisticated operator but rather a true believer, so I don't think this

277
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,280
is a simple grift. Instead, I think Matt Walsh is someone who is just lucky. To explain this,

278
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,200
I have to zoom out a little bit though. There's a helpful tool we'll need to understand called

279
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:22,240
the Overton Window. For those who are unfamiliar, that explains how political discourse exists on

280
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,840
a spectrum that changes over time. What's left-wing today can become right-wing tomorrow and vice versa,

281
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,640
depending on a population's general political leaning. The general political sentiments of a

282
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:38,480
population are called the Overton Window. Anything outside that window is considered extreme.

283
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,280
So if we're talking about the United States, this can usually be split along party lines,

284
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,520
though it's possible to be further to the left or right in either party and still be part of

285
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,520
mainstream political discourse. But if you go too far, say being an anarchist or an open white

286
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,040
nationalist, you fall right out of the Overton Window and typically have your voice marginalized.

287
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:03,200
This isn't a value judgment by the way, just a statement of how this window works.

288
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,400
Anarchists are cool and interesting people. White nationalists are scum though, and I am judging

289
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,520
them for being terrible. If I were to place Matt Walsh on this spectrum, we'd probably put him

290
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,320
somewhere around here, particularly if we're talking about trans issues. And keep in mind,

291
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,640
this is an image of commonly accepted political discourse, not personal feelings or subtext of the

292
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:30,640
figure we're talking about. So dog whistles and masks, sadly, are in play, even if you're someone

293
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:36,640
who can spot them. They work, and that's why people use them. And sadly, anti-trans rhetoric

294
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,080
is broadly accepted on the right wing, so long as you aren't too obvious with the calls for genocide.

295
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,200
You notice Matt Walsh is just on the side of acceptability when it comes to anti-trans rhetoric.

296
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,400
He'll get pretty close to that line, making a lot of extreme statements, but he's savvy enough to

297
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,960
couch it in a plausible deniability that keeps him from falling outside the Overton window of

298
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:01,920
discourse. There are dozens of political commentators being bankrolled by millionaires and billionaires

299
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,560
trying to influence the discourse. Most of them don't succeed because their talking points don't

300
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:10,880
animate people enough. There are lots of reasons for this, and it varies from person to person,

301
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,360
but the short version is that their particular niche doesn't animate enough of the base.

302
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,400
Matt Walsh happened upon the anti-trans discord with his What is a Woman movie,

303
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:25,040
even talking about trans people for years, but this key success made him the face of a major

304
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:30,240
culture war issue. It's not just that he's anti-trans, but he's anti-trans in a way where he gets

305
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,760
as close to the line as possible while appearing not to cross it. Matt Walsh's success exists

306
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,120
entirely because of the moment he finds himself in, and getting very lucky with that movie.

307
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,960
In this way, pushback against him ironically keeps him relevant. If the issue of trans people were

308
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,520
a little more settled in people's minds and anti-trans sentiment were more commonplace,

309
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,160
he would lose relevance and no one would care about him. And if it were less hospitable to

310
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:02,080
be anti-trans publicly, then he would be shunned as a pariah and would similarly lose his position.

311
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,760
He needs to be in this extreme position to have any sense of relevancy. And while he is relevant

312
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,960
and popular, he could be used to animate the political base, which can be used to fuel

313
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,840
political change. While the far right may not be in danger of going left, they sometimes need to

314
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:22,560
be motivated to vote and organize for various causes, so they need to be riled up with hot

315
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:27,760
button issues. This is what makes Matt Walsh valuable in the right-wing media space. It's not

316
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,800
the value of his commentary being transformative, it's that he happens to hate the right people at

317
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,400
the right time in the right way that can be used to mobilize political change. Or at least that's

318
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,720
the assumption by the people who finance him. This is how Matt Walsh is useful. And just to

319
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,080
be super clear, Matt Walsh didn't invent hating trans people. And in the grand scheme of things,

320
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,080
his critiques are no more interesting or compelling than any other bigot. He just

321
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:57,600
happened to come up with a catchy slogan for it. And he managed to stretch out that one-glib question

322
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,240
into a movie. And that's how someone can make a lucrative career living just on the border of

323
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:08,160
acceptable political discourse. In other words, Matt Walsh's immorality is incredibly lucky.

324
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:13,280
Looking at the impact of anti-trans rhetoric, we can get a sense of the feelings Walsh is tapping

325
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,680
into. Opinion polls regarding transgender people and trans issues varies quite a bit.

326
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:23,200
In a recent Washington Post poll conducted with the KFF, they found anti-trans legislation was

327
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,880
quite popular, particularly when it comes to certain types of gender affirming care for

328
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,840
trans kids. An excerpt from that article reads, nearly seven in ten adults said they opposed

329
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,240
allowing children ages 10 to 14 access to medication that stops the body from going

330
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,200
through puberty and nearly six in ten oppose giving 15 to 17 year olds access to hormone

331
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:46,080
therapy. There was, however, majority support for gender affirming counseling or therapy,

332
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,960
with more than six in ten supporting this for both age groups. But looking at other polling,

333
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,320
for instance, a poll conducted by PBS NewsHour shows different results. In this case, the question

334
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,960
being asked is, do you support legislation that criminalizes providing gender affirming care for

335
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,960
minors? The results in this poll was that 54% opposed the bans while 43% supported them.

336
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,280
This comparison was made in an article for The Stranger by Alex Corin, a journalist and

337
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:17,120
researcher on transphobia. She highlighted how this poll from the Post and KFF suffers from issues

338
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:23,200
similar to polls on abortion, how questions are asked on polls matter and results shift accordingly.

339
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,160
She brings up another point of comparison. In a Mason Dixon poll in Kentucky, there was an even

340
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:32,880
more pronounced result when it was asked, would you support or oppose a proposed Kentucky law

341
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,680
that would allow the state to overrule parents' decision to obtain certain health care for their

342
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:43,520
transgender teenager, such as certain medications that can regulate the onset of puberty? In this

343
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:50,480
case, 71% opposed the legislation and 21% supported it. As Corin describes in her article, rather than

344
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:55,200
just throw certain polls out in hold of the ones we want, looking at all of this information reveals

345
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,880
to us that what matters to people is who decides in these issues. While people may oppose certain

346
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:05,760
types of gender affirming care personally, that does not necessarily reveal any desire for the

347
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,760
state to intervene and prevent parents from deciding what's best for their child. And there

348
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,040
are still more polls that reveal a general fatigue over trans issues being emphasized in political

349
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:20,640
discourse. Here's an excerpt from the website Roll Call about one recent poll from Data for

350
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,280
Progress. When asked about the more than 400 pieces of legislation working their way through

351
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:30,080
state houses aimed at limiting the rights of transgender and gay people in America,

352
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,680
64% of respondents, including 55% of Republicans, sided with the statement,

353
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:40,320
this is too much legislation, politicians are playing political theater, and using these

354
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,520
bills as a wedge issue. Compared with 25% who agreed with the statement, this is the right

355
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,760
amount of legislation, politicians are dealing with a real danger that needs to be addressed.

356
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,720
This figure rose to 78% among respondents who know a transgender person. And that last part is

357
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:00,880
especially interesting because just knowing a transgender person seems to have a dramatic

358
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,440
impact in all polling for supporting transgender people in general, and also underscores the

359
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,480
importance of representation. Seeing who these people are and the struggles they go with creates

360
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,960
greater degrees of sympathy and support. Other results show that the younger generation is

361
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,360
generally pro-trans rights, with some predicting a massive change on the topic within 10 years.

362
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:24,720
All that said, it's also true that many people are still ignorant regarding trans issues,

363
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,360
and remain susceptible to messengers like Walsh. That's part of what makes him particularly

364
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,080
valuable. One funny thing I noticed while watching Matt Walsh was he often fought back against other

365
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:39,200
figures on the right when they would criticize an emphasis on the culture wars. Okay, understand

366
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:44,240
this, if you are doing this whole focus on the economy, not the culture war thing, you are

367
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:50,960
repeating the same talking point that the GOP establishment has used for 40 years. It's because

368
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,040
the Republican Party, who are supposed to be ostensibly the leaders of the conservative

369
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,440
movement for decades now, they've been saying the culture doesn't matter, all that matters is the

370
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,840
economy and foreign policy, let's worry about that. And so they surrendered the culture to the left,

371
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,080
and now here we are. The defensiveness and lack of historical literacy here is pretty funny. The

372
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:14,000
right has been harping about culture war issues for decades. They brought them up with gay

373
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,720
marriage, prayer in school, and all sorts of religiously themed topics I would assume Matt

374
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,280
Walsh would know something about. Obviously what Matt Walsh is concerned with here is

375
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:28,640
sliding into political relevancy. Without the culture wars and specifically anti-trans rhetoric,

376
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:33,200
no one would care about what this guy has to say, so he has to cling on to it for dear life.

377
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,480
But the reason there's a pushback against culture war issues by the right,

378
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,040
at least when it comes to trans issues, is that it's a very poor political performer.

379
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:46,560
In a sub-stacked post from a user named Ettingermentum titled The Modern Electoral History of

380
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:51,120
Transphobia, we get a lengthy breakdown in how many times transphobia has failed at the ballot

381
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,960
box in the United States, most recently in the 2022 midterm elections. What much of the polling

382
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,120
highlighted early in this video fails to capture, and something I wish people would understand

383
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:05,680
broadly about any opinion poll, is that just because someone feels a way about an issue

384
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,160
doesn't mean that that issue will influence how they vote, or how they'll even politically

385
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:15,440
organize. For example, if ketchup had a 90% approval rating and a politician said they were

386
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:20,560
going to ban it, it probably wouldn't influence the election if voters were convinced that that

387
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:25,760
same politician had a plan that would revitalize the economy for working people. Issues like the

388
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:30,800
economy are far more important in elections than what you put on your french fries. But that speaks

389
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,120
to something that Ettingermentum brings up in their article. Here's an excerpt.

390
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:39,920
While general public apathy towards the issue means that voters are exceedingly unlikely

391
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,400
to vote for republicans because of anti-trans messaging, as has been extensively demonstrated,

392
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:52,320
it also means that politicians who pass anti-trans laws are not likely to face significant electoral

393
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,440
pushback over it. And that would explain why so many anti-trans laws are being passed in

394
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,880
red states with limited pushback. People are generally not motivated by transphobia,

395
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,520
whether it's to take part of the transphobia or to stand against it. And while that's great for

396
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:13,280
the former, it's tragic for the latter. These are issues that people should want to take a stand for,

397
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:19,280
to stand up for the humanity of people. And the saddest part of these polls are the people who

398
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:25,120
just seem willing to not care. And so even if someone like Bat Walsh has limited appeal,

399
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:29,200
it's important for people to know what sort of hate a goal like this is spreading because even

400
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,360
if it won't swing a federal election, it's still something that impacts any transgender person

401
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:38,320
living in a red state or any transgender person more broadly who's been a victim of harassment

402
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,280
or a hate crime. If anti-trans legislation isn't going to move the needle electorally, it does raise

403
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,240
the question of why do it at all. And the answer seems to be, according to Antony Grementum,

404
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:53,520
is that some of these people are just true believers. Here's another excerpt from the article.

405
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,480
Much like the old demographics as destiny theory that captured the Democratic Party in the 2000s

406
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:06,640
and 2010s, anti-trans or more broadly anti-woke lore is the right kind of story for the right

407
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:12,800
political class at just the right time. I swear, I thought of using that phrase to describe Bat

408
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:17,280
Walsh before reading this article, but it does speak to how his success really is a product of

409
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,560
very fortunate timing. And while a lot of this is being presented in this video as how it impacts

410
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:27,200
electoral politics, I do want to stress there are many other real threats impacting transgender

411
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,640
people outside of legislation. The frightening number of hate crimes, including murder, is fostered

412
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,240
by anti-trans render spread by the likes of Walsh. I'm not entirely sure he's savvy enough to be aware

413
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:44,000
that his hobby horse has no real electoral heft, but if he is, that's even worse, because instead

414
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:48,320
of being a willing tool of the right-wing media ecosystem that serves as a PR wing for the

415
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:53,600
Republican Party, he's instead using this platform he's lucked into to make as much money as he can

416
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:58,160
while spreading hatred that actively harms transgender people. There is a bit of a silver

417
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:03,600
lining here in that one-trick ponies rarely have any staying power. While transphobia will be a

418
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:08,640
long-term struggle, the fight against mediocre bigots like Matt Walsh probably won't be as long.

419
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,280
So the whole point of this video, I guess, is to remind everyone that the fight for trans rights

420
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,560
is about more than this guy, and while it's important to oppose him, the real problem is

421
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:23,440
the moment we find ourselves in when trans people are continuously under threat. Going back to the

422
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:28,560
point I mentioned earlier, most people aren't motivated by trans issues. Not caring is perfectly

423
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:33,040
fine in a better world, letting people live how they choose without making your business is a very

424
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,840
good and valid position. But right now we live in a world that's hostile to trans people, and that

425
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:43,360
threat is multiplied for a number of intersectional identities. So it's not just trans men and trans

426
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:48,320
women who are under threat, but also non-binary people, transgender people who are POCs or have

427
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,960
disabilities, or just any transgender person who might need somebody to fight alongside them.

428
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,080
So I guess the message I hope you all take away from this is that, when fighting for the rights

429
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:02,560
of others, it's less about fighting against a certain man and more about fighting in a certain

430
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:08,320
moment. A big thanks to all the trans creators who blended their voice to this video. I hope

431
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,120
you all check out their channels listed below. Once upon a time, I told myself I would never

432
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:19,680
make a video discussing Matt Walsh because he is so boring and untalented and inconsequential.

433
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,040
Sadly, things have changed to the point where he actually is worth some attention and some
