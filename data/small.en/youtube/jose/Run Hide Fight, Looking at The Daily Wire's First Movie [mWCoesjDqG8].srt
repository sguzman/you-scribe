1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
This is not a good movie.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,440
The world is great, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,440
On January 4th, right-wing news commentary website The Daily Wire

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,480
announced it had purchased the distribution rights to the movie

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,480
Run, Hide, Fight, a movie that is often described as die-hard set in a school shooting.

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,000
The movie is part of the Daily Wire's attempt to move into the world of entertainment,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,080
according to an article written by one of the Daily Wire co-founders, Ben Shapiro.

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,000
We're going to be bringing out movies.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,760
Edgy, entertaining, awesome movies that won't mock your values.

10
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,680
We're going to be producing TV shows, comedies and dramas that take you seriously

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,200
and that don't take advantage of your viewership to promote leftist causes.

12
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:45,520
The Daily Wire is currently developing one feature and two TV series,

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,920
though no specific details about those have been announced.

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,920
Part ofly, madly, desperately hopes they're adapting the works of Ben Shapiro for the screen.

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,000
Sadly, Run, Hide, Fight was not inspired by the written works of Ben Shapiro.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,160
In fact, this film was produced completely independently of The Daily Wire's new

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,160
initiative and their only attachment to Run, Hide, Fight is to be its distributor.

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:12,320
There are no grim bread hawthorn esquiros or drug dealers posing as civil rights activists.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,440
Instead, we have a simpler story of a teenage girl who has to gun down her classmates after

20
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,720
they try to shoot up their school.

21
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
An action movie used in a school shooting as a backdrop doesn't scream leftist values,

22
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
so I can see why they chose this as their first film to distribute.

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
The article also echoes an important lesson learned from Andrew Breitbart,

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,760
who Shapiro calls his mentor, the idea of politics being downstream from culture.

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,880
This move into the entertainment industry is, according to Shapiro,

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,320
about fighting back against the left who supposedly dominate

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,280
the major institutions of the entertainment industry.

28
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
According to Jeremy Boring, co-CEO of The Daily Wire,

29
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,040
this is a gut-wrenching film that refuses to offer easy talking points,

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,040
which is why liberal Hollywood executives have refused to distribute it.

31
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,280
The trailer had a very strong reaction on YouTube,

32
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,440
with nearly 1.5 million views within its first two weeks of going up.

33
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,560
The movie takes its name from a survival tactic recommended to people

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,840
and instructing them on how to survive a mass shooting incident.

35
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,800
This weird, cheesy training video is on YouTube and has over 9 million views.

36
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,560
Run, Hide, Fight made its North American debut on January 14th

37
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,080
in a streaming event hosted on the Daily Wire website in YouTube.

38
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,360
According to Boring, the stream had over 70,000 viewers,

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,880
but the more important question, how was the movie?

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,800
The plot is very easily summarized.

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,920
High school senior Zoe Hall, played by Isabel May,

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,440
is disengaging from her life following the recent passing of her mother.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,760
Upon going to school, her day is interrupted by the arrival of four school shooters

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,800
who take some of their classmates hostage in the cafeteria.

45
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:50,160
The shooters livestream the hostage situation while Zoe first runs, hides, and then fights.

46
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,640
She takes out each of the three cronies before killing their ringleader in the movie's final moments.

47
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,880
Not exactly a plot filled with surprising twists and turns,

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,600
and one completely predictable for anyone who saw the trailer.

49
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,640
In spite of the subject material, this is a movie that very safely follows the action movie formulas.

50
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,440
School shootings are indeed a rare topic in films.

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,000
There are several of them out there, such as Elephant,

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,440
We Need to Talk About Kevin, Polytechnique, and a handful of others.

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,360
They often take artistic approaches you don't typically see in mainstream movies.

54
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,080
The very real horror of a school shooting seems to demand

55
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,360
filmmakers use unorthodox methods to broach the subject.

56
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,920
Or maybe it's just a subject that attracts filmmakers

57
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,200
whose talents don't neatly fit into the mainstream mold.

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,560
But this is not one of those movies.

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,080
Throughout its run, Run, Hide, Fight feels like a popcorn movie.

60
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,040
Which is a strange experience, considering the subject matter.

61
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,280
It seems to be asking the audience to compartmentalize the very real tragedy of a school shooting,

62
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,600
put all that baggage aside, and watch the movie as a form of entertainment.

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,080
The idea of ignoring the tragedy of a school shooting,

64
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,560
at least insofar in wanting to discuss it politically, is often a project of the right.

65
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,880
Whenever a school shooting happens, conversations about gun control are immediately silenced,

66
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:04,880
and at best you might get some token discussion about mental health.

67
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,720
Discussion that isn't terribly helpful,

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,720
considering most mental health conditions don't result in school shootings.

69
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,400
In fact, the vast majority don't.

70
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,160
What we're more likely to hear are refrains about not wanting to disrespect

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,960
the victims by politicizing a tragedy.

72
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,200
In other words, don't consider any potential political action

73
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,160
that might reduce the possibility of future school shootings.

74
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,520
With that in mind, it's unsurprising that a conservative audience might be more capable

75
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,840
of compartmentalizing a phenomena that right-wing media rarely critically examines.

76
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
School shootings are something to be prepared for,

77
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,640
but are also something that we're supposedly unable to actively prevent.

78
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,360
Movies like this seem to be suggesting that school shootings,

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
a rarity outside of the last few decades, are now part of the new normal.

80
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,240
So we might as well make some action movies about them.

81
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,040
This movie has a hero, Zoe Hall, which is a rarity for movies about school shootings.

82
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,240
After all, if the purpose of the film is to explore the tragedy,

83
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
a hero who prevents said tragedy seems counterproductive.

84
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
In this case, the movie tries to have it both ways,

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,600
featuring a number of students getting killed at the beginning of the hostage situation.

86
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,880
Also, unlike other movies about school shootings, in the opening scene of the movie,

87
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,640
the impending school shooting is foreshadowed with heavy-handed dialogue.

88
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm gonna record an EP this summer.

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,640
No way.

90
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:19,200
Yeah, give the dream a shot before reality kicks me in the cooch.

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,080
Nice!

92
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,120
Jump cut scares.

93
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:23,680
Okay!

94
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,560
And two different explosions.

95
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,320
This is not a subtle film.

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
Zoe is one of those strange leading characters who happens to be the only one in the movie with

97
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,480
functioning eyes and notices something is slightly off during the day,

98
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:39,600
such as the smoke from an explosion moving across the sky.

99
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,960
Strangely though, Zoe completely misses the beginning of the school shooting.

100
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
It unfolds with the quartet of shooters crashing their van into the cafeteria

101
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
and firing off a machine gun.

102
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
Zoe, who's in the cafeteria washroom,

103
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,760
can't hear any of this over what must be the loudest hand dryer in the history of mankind.

104
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,440
And no one else in the school hears it either.

105
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,040
Classes go about normally.

106
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,880
While I can't speak to the structure of high schools in rural Nebraska,

107
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,160
I have to imagine someone would hear a van smashing into the cafeteria

108
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
and the machine gun fire that followed.

109
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
We then meet the villains of the movie.

110
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,280
Their leader, Tristan, played by Eli Brown,

111
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,280
is instantly unlikable as he acts like a cheesy action movie villain.

112
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:22,160
I suppose we're meant to hate him, but I just wanted him off my screen.

113
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,400
Tristan has a master plan to shoot up the school.

114
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,120
You see, those explosions earlier were planted by him and his pals to distract the cops.

115
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,280
They then disable the school's internal systems,

116
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,040
arrange a livestream, and plant even more explosives around the school.

117
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,760
These are surprisingly competent school shooters.

118
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,480
If this nefarious plot sounds a little familiar to you,

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,760
it's probably because Tristan also happens to be the Joker.

120
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,120
His scheming is very similar to the Joker's in The Dark Knight,

121
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
who plows a bus into a bank,

122
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,840
has his minions disrupt the building's internal systems,

123
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,640
and disguises himself as one of his victims to escape.

124
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,480
There's also an echo of the classic Joker with one of Tristan's followers

125
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:03,280
being this goth-like Harley Quinn figure Anna, played by Catherine Davis.

126
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,880
And if you look closely, Tristan's gait kind of looks like the one

127
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,800
Keith Ledger is doing in The Dark Knight.

128
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,040
To be fair though, if someone did try to shoot up a school,

129
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,080
I wouldn't be surprised if they thought of themselves as the Joker too.

130
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,400
I would have guessed the Joaquin Phoenix version.

131
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,680
Tristan's motivations are a bit less interesting than the Joker's though.

132
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,800
He wants to be famous. On social media.

133
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,240
And instead of starting a YouTube channel where he complains about women in Star Wars,

134
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,440
he's decided to create the definitive school shooting.

135
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,080
Okay? Everybody watching is culpable.

136
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,720
You all post, and you tweet, and you share.

137
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
Everybody jumps at the chance to be both judge and jury, but in that system...

138
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
Be sure that you created a job opening.

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,280
An executioner.

140
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,120
You created me.

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,160
And what does it for you?

142
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,380
Uh...

143
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,000
Being definitive.

144
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,120
And creating the ultimate version of something.

145
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,160
The only interesting thing about Tristan is that, secretly,

146
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,400
I think he's a conservative.

147
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,640
Here are a few telltale lines of dialogue.

148
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,800
We get a cheesy joke about trigger warnings.

149
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,000
Trigger warnings.

150
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,840
He laughs at how inept school security is without a gun.

151
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,600
As if it's not sad enough that they're only paying them $12 an hour to protect our school,

152
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,680
they expect you to do without a f***ing gun?

153
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,520
And we get this little nugget to see a lip.

154
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,080
It's not that hard to build a wall.

155
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:35,040
Looking at the film's protagonist and her love interest, Lewis, played by Holly Shulerton,

156
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,120
I can't help but think that if this movie hadn't been distributed by the Daily Wire,

157
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,640
we'd be hearing cries of Mary Sue and forced diversity.

158
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,400
We'd probably hear some anger over all the villains being white too.

159
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:51,200
That is, if anyone would care about this movie to begin with.

160
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,800
Going back to the school shooters though, each of them is surprisingly uninteresting.

161
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Anna is Tristan's girlfriend.

162
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
And that sums up her whole character.

163
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,720
Oh, and she smokes weed, I guess that's another thing.

164
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,960
Then we have Kip, played by Cyrus Arnold,

165
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:12,320
who fell under Tristan's sway because someone pulled his pants down

166
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,400
in front of the whole school a couple of years ago.

167
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,800
Kip has a baffling redemption arc where a two-minute talk from Zoe leads him to betraying Tristan.

168
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,360
He still ends up dying though, albeit so we can buy Zoe a few moments to escape a tight spot.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,920
Most tragic though is Chris, played by Britain Seer.

170
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,680
He's Anna's brother, and apparently also romantically involved with Tristan.

171
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,800
I'm not sure how the dynamics of this relationship work,

172
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,960
but more importantly, Chris has some kind of severe mental health condition.

173
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,040
The movie never says what exactly,

174
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
though it seems like schizophrenia.

175
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,560
He's one of those characters who's less a character and more just a collection of walking symptoms.

176
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,280
And it makes him an easy tool to be used by Tristan,

177
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:57,680
until he's eventually shot by Zoe's father, played by Thomas Jane.

178
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,920
He was hanging around outside the school with a sniper rifle because that's what army dads do,

179
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,640
I guess.

180
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,320
Chris is easily one of the worst depictions of someone with a mental health condition.

181
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,400
I've seen in quite a while.

182
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,120
You might notice that all the antagonists are paper thin,

183
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,280
with weak or no motivations at all.

184
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,760
That's because a big part of this movie's intent,

185
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,240
according to the writer-director Kyle Rankin, was to not glamorize the shooter.

186
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,120
The fact that this movie could only shift the focus away from the shooter

187
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,800
by creating a completely artificial scenario that let a hero step in

188
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,760
speaks to how removed from reality this whole movie is.

189
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,920
Which is especially ironic because many of the positive reviews I've read for this movie,

190
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,760
and even comments in post-movie discussion, highlight the realism of it.

191
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,240
One of Zoe's early encounters with one of the shooters

192
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,840
is when Anna gets the drop on her as Zoe is trying to warn classrooms

193
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,600
about the shooting in the cafeteria.

194
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,560
Zoe is shot in the leg but still somehow manages to get the drop on Anna, turning her own gun on her.

195
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,680
The movie keeps going for a good 40 minutes after Zoe has been shot

196
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,280
as she runs around the school, takes down the other shooters, and saves her classmates.

197
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:01,360
A teacher at one point, instead of telling her student, who has a gunshot wound by the way,

198
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,000
to get to safety and maybe get medical attention,

199
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,920
instead goes with her on her mission.

200
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,320
Somehow this is meant to be realistic.

201
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,960
I think more likely the conservative audience,

202
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,640
obviously curated from the Daily Wire readers,

203
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,320
are seeing a version of reality they would rather was true,

204
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,160
instead of the more tragic reality of what happens at an actual school shooting.

205
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
But what I found most objectionable,

206
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,880
the part where this movie fully devolves into psycho-territory, happens in its final minutes.

207
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,720
It's a callback to the opening scene where we can see Zoe and her father hunting a deer.

208
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,200
The deer is mortally wounded but not killed,

209
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,800
and as Thomas Jane delivers a monologue about putting an animal out of its misery,

210
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,880
Zoe smashes a rock on the deer's head to reveal she is a troubled person,

211
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
still dealing with the recent death of her mother.

212
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,560
In the final moments of the movie, we find out Tristan has given the cops the slip,

213
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,120
and is slowly sneaking away from the scene of the crime.

214
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,680
Even though dozens of kids have seen his face and his only disguise is an orange baseball cap,

215
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,040
he nearly makes it out.

216
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,960
It's only Zoe who spots him.

217
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,880
Instead of telling the cops about it, she grabs her dad's rifle,

218
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,160
stalks Tristan, and then shoots him like a wild animal.

219
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,200
As he bleeds out, she walks towards him,

220
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:13,360
repeating her father's monologue from the first scene about putting an animal out of its misery,

221
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,760
but instead of smashing the rock on Tristan's head,

222
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,720
Zoe's transformation in this movie is to go from troubled teen and mourning,

223
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,920
pulling away from life, to the hero fully engaged with life,

224
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,000
who also happens to enjoy watching villains suffering a miserable death.

225
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,680
There's something disturbing and sadistic about an ending like this.

226
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,440
In the hands of a more competent filmmaker, the ending could have highlighted how even

227
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,200
being a hero in a school shooting creates a trauma that shatters all the good and

228
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,640
compassion out of a person.

229
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,600
The ending would be tragic, even if it seemed like justice.

230
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
But in this film, Zoe's path is presented as righteous,

231
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,520
and her growth is framed as something to be celebrated.

232
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:03,680
She's letting go of the pain of losing her mother and finding a reason to live in helping

233
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,240
people, but no one was helped in this final scene.

234
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,920
It was her needlessly doling out her own brand of justice.

235
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,920
Much like the death of Kip, who is on the path to redemption, the movie seems to be

236
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:18,960
operating under the idea that committing these crimes requires a swift punishment,

237
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,720
in this case, a death sentence.

238
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,680
It certainly falls in line with an earlier scene where a religious student,

239
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,400
who only speaks in this scene, has a moment with Tristan

240
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:29,520
Free will.

241
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,840
God allows the wicked to do their wickedness.

242
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,160
Oh yeah, why's that?

243
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,200
So they can be judged.

244
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:50,080
Tristan's death is supposed to be viewed as an act of justice, but to me it only reads tragically.

245
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:53,520
This movie, for all its errors of being popcorn entertainment,

246
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:57,120
with vague allusions to heroism in the face of tragedy,

247
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,760
can't escape the sad truth that, even in some kind of absurd power fantasy,

248
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,040
a school shooting will still end in tragedy, and the movie's veneer of justice being served

249
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,960
reveals a shallow excuse for how tragedies scar the survivors.

250
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:16,480
If this movie had been deliberately moving to this ending on that sour downbeat note,

251
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,000
it might have won me over.

252
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:23,040
But as it is, this feels like my reading attempting to salvage what is otherwise a

253
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,880
completely forgettable movie.

254
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,920
On the night of its North American premiere, after the movie's screened,

255
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,440
there was a short discussion with one of the movie's producers, Dallas Sonnier,

256
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,520
and the movie's writer and director, Kyle Rankin.

257
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:37,840
While watching the movie, one thing that was incredibly apparent was how shallow

258
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
the motivations were for the shooters.

259
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,680
In this conversation, we find out that's what drew Ben Shapiro to the movie in the first place.

260
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,440
We need to treat them for the villains they are.

261
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,880
It can't be all about, you know, their tough childhoods, as you were suggesting,

262
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,480
or the sort of crippling circumstances they went through, look how tough life is for them.

263
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:52,800
The film, actually.

264
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,720
The focus in this film is really on the victims.

265
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,160
It really, really is on the victim.

266
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,920
It's weird to hear that, because the focus isn't really on the victims at all.

267
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,520
Most of the victims are faceless students we never even learn the names of.

268
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:06,720
If we compare this movie to one of the earlier movies about school shootings,

269
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,640
Gus Van Sant's 2003 movie, Elephant, we see a dramatically different depiction

270
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,600
of a school shooting.

271
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,080
While both films take place during a single day,

272
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,960
Elephant spends time with over 10 different students,

273
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,520
and most of that time is spent with students who are victims.

274
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:22,000
My favorite example is the character Michelle.

275
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,800
There's something so incredibly sad about her scenes.

276
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,440
A quiet young girl who often fades into the background.

277
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,840
We don't see her do anything but go about her day,

278
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,160
keeping her head down while trying to get by.

279
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,240
There's one scene where two characters, John and Elias, meet in an empty hallway,

280
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,080
and Elias takes a picture of John.

281
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,040
Since the movie jumps around in the timeline events of the day,

282
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
we see this scene three times.

283
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,840
First from John's perspective, then Elias's, and then finally from Michelle's.

284
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,880
In the first two scenes, even though we've been introduced to Michelle already,

285
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,760
we don't even notice she appears in this moment until the focus shifts in that third scene.

286
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,720
It emphasizes that this is a character we don't see until we're directed towards her.

287
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,840
The only time in the movie someone sees Michelle pulling her face from the crowd

288
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,080
is in the library where she's helping out.

289
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,280
The person who sees her is one of the school shooters,

290
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,560
and we find out she's the first victim of the day.

291
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,200
Even though we know very little about the character,

292
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,720
the fact that we know so little reveals how little attention we pay

293
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,040
to the inner lives of teenagers in general.

294
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,440
The movie is making us consider that fact and how it might lead to people like the shooters,

295
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,800
and perhaps more importantly, to value the quiet people around

296
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,120
who we sadly let fade into the background unless they become the face of a tragedy.

297
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,560
We'll never know what kindness or compassion or beauty

298
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,880
might have been within a character like Michelle.

299
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,200
And thanks to the shooters, we never will.

300
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,920
The moment where Michelle is killed

301
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,000
contains so much more tragedy and heartbreak

302
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,640
than the first teen killed in Run, Hide, Fight.

303
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:54,160
The first teen killed in Run, Hide, Fight is right here,

304
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,920
under the tire of the van.

305
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:59,440
Well, it's never really explained why the kid crawled under the van.

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,200
As we can see clearly in the previous shot, the van didn't run over anybody.

307
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,400
We don't know his name,

308
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,400
or the name of the girl who shot right after him,

309
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
or this guy who stabbed next.

310
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,640
They just die in an effort to raise the stakes.

311
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:14,320
This is a movie that focuses on some of the victims,

312
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,840
but clearly not all victims are considered equal.

313
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,160
The ones who fight back were remembered.

314
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,800
Those who don't, who might have died a death like Michelle,

315
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,440
are destined to be forgotten.

316
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,520
The Daily Wire crew also wants to highlight

317
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,960
how honest this movie is in its depiction of the shooters.

318
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,400
It has a more honest take on the people who perpetrate these crimes

319
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,720
than most even news articles or documentaries that you see.

320
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,440
It's trivially easy to explain how other movies that depict school shootings

321
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,000
provide more thoughtful depictions of the shooters.

322
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
I could highlight, for instance,

323
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,840
Il Marag's 2007 movie Class, where a bully befriends his victim

324
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
and their friendship fuels school hostilities,

325
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,160
leading them to murder their classmates.

326
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,240
Or I could talk about Matthew Johnson's 2013 movie The Dirties,

327
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,600
where a teenage boy's outsider status and obsession with movies

328
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,800
detach him from reality, eventually leading to tragedy.

329
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,880
Movies like these two make genuine attempts

330
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,880
to examine the psychology of school shooters

331
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,000
and the impact alienation from their peer group has on them.

332
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
Run, Hide, Fight gives us very little in the way of backstory

333
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
for any of the students, aside from Kip.

334
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,800
And in that case, it's used in a conversation that can redeem.

335
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,520
If anything, the film deliberately avoids this type of death

336
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,360
for its characters to prevent the audience

337
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,040
from feeling any sympathy for them.

338
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,240
Boring and Shapiro actually hit it on the head when they say this.

339
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,400
You really took kind of an unflinching look at the evil that you were saying, yeah.

340
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,760
With regard to the shooters,

341
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,640
this movie is trying to display the evil they represent

342
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,160
as something inherent and not the product of circumstances.

343
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,320
Again, echoing the statements of the religious character earlier on,

344
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,480
evil actions are permitted by God so that the evil-doers can be judged.

345
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,360
What made them evil to begin with is never considered.

346
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,240
This reminds me very much of a comment made during the 2008 American election.

347
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,360
The candidates at the time were Barack Obama and John McCain,

348
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,200
and they were both asked about evil.

349
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,960
Obama gave a long-winded response about understanding evil,

350
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,640
the actions we take to confront it,

351
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,840
and how trying to stop what we consider evil can have consequences we would also consider evil.

352
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,600
It's kind of convoluted, you can read it here if you're curious.

353
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,200
John McCain's response, though, was much more terse.

354
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,200
His response to what should be done about evil was to say, defeat it.

355
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,760
I think this represents two fundamentally different ways of looking at the concept of evil.

356
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,760
When the label is applied to a person,

357
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Ben Shapiro, the rest of the Daily Wire crew, and the movie Run, Hide, Fight

358
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,080
clearly fall into the latter camp.

359
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
School shooters aren't meant to be something that can be understood or considered through art,

360
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:49,520
rather they present the opportunity for a simple morality tale of good, triumphing over evil.

361
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,680
One especially revealing part of the discussions that preceded and followed the premiere

362
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,480
is the victims the Daily Wire crew is most concerned with...

363
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
Conservatives.

364
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,480
They'll still let you watch their movies, of course, their TV shows, their news, their sports,

365
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,680
but you'll have to do it knowing that everyone who made that content,

366
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,240
at least everyone at the top, hates you.

367
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,440
Replacement institutions for all the institutions that hate our guts.

368
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,040
The left obviously wants to silence and remove voices that they don't agree with.

369
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,560
There are artists on left and right with talent who can express those visions,

370
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,680
but we're not allowed.

371
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,920
We've been, as conservatives, progressively locked out of every single institution, every single one.

372
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:28,320
This project to bring movies to their audience is fueled by the same victimhood mentality that

373
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,960
runs through all their work. The left controls everything and hates the right with a burning

374
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,600
passion. Of the five people representing the Daily Wire, Jeremy Boring, Andrew Clavin,

375
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,000
Michael Knowles, and Ben Shapiro all have unremarkable careers trying to make it in

376
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,320
the entertainment business. They are also convinced that the reasons they didn't make it

377
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,880
is because conservatives are forbidden into the halls of Hollywood.

378
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:55,360
While we could play the silly game of counting big conservative stars, such as Clint Eastwood,

379
00:20:55,360 --> 00:21:00,000
it's probably better to look at the creative writing of Ben Shapiro and let that speak to why

380
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,600
he and possibly his buddies didn't make it too far in the world of Hollywood.

381
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:08,720
With the knowledge of their creative limitations and some obvious bitterness in their critique,

382
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,040
this whole endeavor has a different look to it. It seems less about providing entertainment to an

383
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,960
underserved audience, but rather an attempt to vindicate their own anger at the world of

384
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,360
Hollywood, fighting back with their own movies, created by conservatives.

385
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,480
It very much has a, we'll show them, vibe to it.

386
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,320
Although Kyle Rankin is vague about his political beliefs,

387
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,840
his producer, Dallas Sonnier, is less cagey about it.

388
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,800
I stayed the same. The world went left, right? I stayed here. And so I'm simply making the

389
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,080
movies that I grew up loving.

390
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,200
And when describing the movie, they seem fairly comfortable with it becoming

391
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,520
embraced by a conservative audience.

392
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:53,120
If the marketplace or the audience determines that the movie is more conservative in its values

393
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,200
or matrix or DNA, then so be it. That's fine with me.

394
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:03,840
And there's an attempt to frame this movie as enjoyable by a wider audience that presumably

395
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,800
doesn't just include conservatives. If so, it makes me wonder why the only way to see this movie

396
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:13,440
is to become a member on the Daily Wire website where you would have to pay $14 a month to watch

397
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,360
it. You also get access to some other Daily Wire content, but unless you're a fan of conservative

398
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,480
media, and likely a conservative yourself, there isn't much value in that monthly fee.

399
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,280
One thing it does do, though, is ensure that the audience for Run, Hide, Fight will be primed to

400
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:35,040
enjoy it. And not simply because they enjoy its quality, but because it's part of a grander project

401
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,000
of fighting back in the culture against the left.

402
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,080
Entertainment that you can not only enjoy, but be proud of knowing that you helped change the

403
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,320
culture. And ultimately, that's the key.

404
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,720
It also means the audience who determine the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB

405
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,480
are only coming from a conservative audience who have been primed to enjoy the movie,

406
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,360
and likely may be inflated. And negative reviews of the movie,

407
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,600
well, those are brushed off as being product of the extreme left.

408
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:10,000
The voices on the extreme left have not been open to the movie. In fact, they've been almost

409
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:15,600
resistant to it, reviewing when they review it. I don't want to ever single out an individual

410
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,120
review because I don't like it when filmmakers do that. But I saw a systemic

411
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,320
system in the reviews where it felt very much like a concerted effort to review the subject matter

412
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:34,720
and perceived politics rather than the actual movie.

413
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,480
I can understand the assumption that once The Daily Wire became involved,

414
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,320
the way critics look at this movie would be altered. Heck, I wouldn't be reviewing this

415
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,760
movie at all had I not read the story about The Daily Wire's connection to it.

416
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,600
But to brush off negative criticisms as coming from the extreme left, who are ignoring the

417
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:57,040
quality of the movie, is absolutely not true. I read every single review of this movie when

418
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:01,600
it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September of 2020. That's right, I read

419
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,840
all seven of them. Of those seven, six were negative. Jessica Kiang wrote,

420
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,280
At literally no point in this weirdly lumbering, sluggish movie's narrative does its grotesque,

421
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:19,120
tastelessness ever appear to have occurred to anyone involved. David Ehrlich wrote,

422
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,920
It's a movie made by someone who's seen too many movies and now made at least one too many as well.

423
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:29,840
And from Guy Lodge, What would you do? The film tastelessly needles its viewers throughout,

424
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,280
presenting the brawniest, most impossible answer all the while.

425
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,920
These reviews do make note of the subject matter, because how could you not,

426
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:43,200
but only in the context of how the film depicts it. The one positive review came from Christian

427
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:48,960
Toto. If there is a message here, it's an honest, unblinking one. Some children are broken as they

428
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:55,200
near adulthood, a tragic lesson we've learned from real life headlines. Question as to why those

429
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:00,240
children are broken, though, is for superior movies. This one just wants us to celebrate

430
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:05,600
another child murdering them. There's a Hunger Games vibe here. It's not just that Isabel May

431
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,960
looks a bit like Jennifer Lawrence. It's that we in the audience are very much like the detached,

432
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:17,120
rich elites who watch teenagers kill each other. At least we aren't doing it for real. We're doing

433
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,040
it in movies inspired by real life events. In a brief behind the scenes documentary for the movie,

434
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:27,680
many of the cast members shared their opinions that this movie might be positively read as a

435
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,800
call to action. Not for any sort of political action, of course. Instead, it's to possibly

436
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,200
inspire someone who might face a similar situation to fight back. If we become more proactive,

437
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,040
and it does take a little bit of bravery, it doesn't mean you can't be scared, but to act

438
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:52,800
proactively is going to save lives. That's a recommendation that's so depressing. I can only

439
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:56,400
hope they were desperately trying to find something constructive to say, and hadn't

440
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:01,280
had more than a few moments to think about it. To be clear, I bear no ill will to any actor,

441
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,600
or even some of the crew who are involved in the making of this movie. Everyone's gotta earn a

442
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,960
living somehow, and sometimes you sign up for a movie not necessarily knowing how it's going to

443
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,400
turn out. One particular plot point, or lack thereof, was an explanation as to where these

444
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,160
teenagers got hold of so many guns. They had two pistols, a shotgun, and a machine gun. The machine

445
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:27,920
gun is an MP40, which is what the Germans used during World War II. A not-so-subtle reminder

446
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:33,840
that these are the bad guys. The absence of any explanation for where these guns came from seems

447
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,760
to me like an absolute refusal to even speak to the gun culture of the United States. Everyone

448
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:45,680
has guns, even relics from World War II. This is just a fact of life. And the idea that teenagers

449
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:51,200
who want to shoot up a school, perhaps, just perhaps, shouldn't be able to put together a

450
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,400
cache of weapons is never really explored. The idea that there might be a problem with the gun

451
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:01,680
culture of the United States is just one more thing this film does not want us thinking about.

452
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,400
It's ironic hearing the writer, director, or producer, anyone involved with this movie

453
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,480
talking about wanting to start a conversation or dialogue when this film seems entirely uninterested

454
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:18,960
in presenting even the most basic starting point for a discussion. It was probably best summed up

455
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,880
by, of all people, Matt Walsh. When following the screening, he said this.

456
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:39,920
The idea of a school shooting being fodder for escapism is a creepy thought. It makes something

457
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:46,560
that should be upsetting by the nature of its rarity seem commonplace and regular and normal.

458
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,160
It does nothing to even broach the hard questions of why school shootings happen.

459
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:56,800
Presenting them is something we should turn our brains off for. It does make heroes out of the

460
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:01,360
victims, though only those who stand and fight against their fellow classmates. It's an ugly

461
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:07,280
burden to put on teenagers, and one made especially ugly by the movie's embrace of national tragedies.

462
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:13,840
What we have is a movie that exploits a tragedy to make a cheesy action film,

463
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,920
and it doesn't really do much more than that.

464
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:21,840
Okay, I need to stop the video right here, right now, for a content warning. I'm going to be

465
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,680
discussing some of the history of the studio that worked on this movie, including some stories

466
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,880
involving animal cruelty and sexual assault. If you're not down for that, feel free to dip out

467
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,160
of the video now. For those who are sticking around, get ready, because things are about to get dark.

468
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:45,920
This film was produced by a company named Bonfire Legends, though originally it went under a

469
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:51,280
different banner, Sinistate. A studio with a number of films under its belt, articles about

470
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:56,480
them describe Sinistate as producing low-budget features for a more conservative audience,

471
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:00,720
although the company's founder and owner, Dallas Sonnier, resists that characterization,

472
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,840
as he feels his movies are apolitical, which is what conservatives happen to want. Speaking to

473
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,560
the Wall Street Journal, he said, if we can make a movie that does not treat them as losers or ask

474
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:15,200
how dare they vote a certain way or pander to them, naturally they're going to respond in a

475
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,360
positive way. Originally Run, Hide, Fight was supposed to launch Sinistate's new

476
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,720
Rebelor brand, though between the announcement of these plans in early 2020 and the present day in

477
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,240
2021, things radically changed. The major controversy to hit the studio was regarding

478
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,760
one of its producers, Adam Donaghy. Donaghy joined Sinistate in 2017, working as a line

479
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,240
producer and executive producer on the films The Standoff at Sparrow Creek, VFW, and Satanic Panic.

480
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:47,200
He was also one of the executive producers on Run, Hide, Fight, before his name was taken off

481
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:52,800
the film a few months before its premiere. In late April of 2020, Donaghy was arrested

482
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:58,240
for the sexual assault of a 16-year-old girl. Following this revelation, a number of allegations

483
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,280
regarding sexual harassment became known to the wider public, revealing that this was a well-known

484
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:08,320
secret within the local Dallas film scene. One of them included a conversation recorded by

485
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,440
Kristen Leah Haynes from 2014, where she was working in the art department of the film

486
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,280
Occupy Texas. At the time, she was 21 years old. In the recording, we can hear Donaghy proposition

487
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:24,640
Haynes asking to see her underwear and then asking for her to participate in sexual acts.

488
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:28,960
The recording and Donaghy's reputation were spread throughout the local film community. There

489
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:33,840
are multiple stories of him aggressively touching or propositioning women on film sets, and he rarely

490
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,560
seemed to face much in the way of consequences. The problem with Donaghy was that he was a line

491
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:43,440
producer, meaning he was in charge of budgeting for the film. He also, in many cases, served as

492
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:48,880
a source of financing for films. He was literally writing the checks of his would-be accusers.

493
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:54,080
And in cases where his actions were brought up to others, they were often minimized or dismissed.

494
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:58,400
In 2017, Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmick began partnering with Donaghy.

495
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,800
In an article by The Daily Beast, 10 people claimed to have directly reached out to the

496
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,440
heads of Sinistate, Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmick, with four of them offering the audio

497
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:12,240
that Haynes have recorded. Each of these people who approached Sonnier and Presmick said that

498
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:17,440
their reports fell on deaf ears. Both the producers claimed to have never heard the recording,

499
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,000
and Sonnier admonished Haynes for not making her report through official channels.

500
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,240
When asked about the allegations against his studio, Sonnier said he was largely unaware of

501
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,560
them. Sonnier told The Daily Beast,

502
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:33,040
We're under siege right now. Everyone involved has their own personal vendettas against us.

503
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,600
They have a history of harassing us and having problems with us. It feels like a targeted hit,

504
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,680
and it feels like an attack. I think people have real issues with us. They have issues with our

505
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,160
success with the amount of movies we've made and in a short time built this company to be something

506
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,440
very special. It feels partisan. When the allegations went public in mid-2020,

507
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:56,720
two of the publications Sinistate owned, Fangoria and Birth Movies Death, parted ways with the

508
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:01,440
company. In an interview with Kyle Rankin, the writer and director of Run, Hide, Fight, he

509
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:06,880
responded to learning about the Donaghy situation, saying, I was blown away. When the news broke,

510
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,200
it was sad and shocking. I believed Sinistate that they didn't know about Adam's past,

511
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,880
and that they were working hard to restructure their company and have very safe sets.

512
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,560
I knew that I ran a very safe set. I knew my side of the street was clean.

513
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,800
I thought I could stick around and affect some change.

514
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:25,120
Though there are no direct allegations of sexual harassment on the set of a movie,

515
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,960
concerns surrounding the production have been raised. Speaking to the Daily Beast,

516
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,600
the film's second assistant director, Kristen Leah Haynes, the woman who recorded Donaghy

517
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:38,000
sexually harassing her, said she joined the production as a favor to a friend and because

518
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,800
she needed the work. She said, there was some really sketchy s*** going on on that movie.

519
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,040
Haynes, who was only on set a few days, was also assured that she would be kept far from Donaghy.

520
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,120
Several of the staff walked off the set of the movie, including the first assistant director,

521
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,480
Meg Beatty, and key hair and makeup artist, Madeline Rose.

522
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:02,000
In Rose's case, she mentions the reason for her departure had to do with the film's opening scene,

523
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,640
where we see Zoe and her father hunting a deer. What bothered Rose about this scene was that this

524
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:12,160
was no special effect. This was a very real deer that was shot on camera for the movie.

525
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:17,440
She describes it. They hired a local hunter, went on his land, and filmed the deer being shot.

526
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,120
Then they took the deer and froze it so they could pull it out again for close-ups with

527
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,800
the actual actors. In the Daily Beast article, Sonia claims it was the legal harvest of a

528
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:31,520
registered buck, and that SAG-AFTRA took no issue with the incident.

529
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,600
Rose voiced her concerns over the deer to Donaghy, and she describes the encounter saying,

530
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:42,400
He went off on me in a very condescending way. He got very heated and told me I was either with

531
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:48,960
them or against them. Rose, who had been unfamiliar with the earlier allegations against Donaghy,

532
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,080
quit the film the following day. Although the deer incident was unknown to the Daily Wire crew

533
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:58,800
when they purchased the rights to distribute this movie, Jeremy Boring did speak to knowing

534
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:03,440
about the incidents regarding Donaghy, having read the earlier Daily Beast article describing

535
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:08,880
the history of sexual harassment and assault on sets Donaghy had worked on. Boring said,

536
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:13,680
To the extent that things may have taken place in the production of this film or another film,

537
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:18,640
I don't think it's my business. In the same way, it's not my business if something takes place at

538
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:23,440
any other kind of company that I buy product from. I'm sure there have been allegations of sexual

539
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,360
harassment at almost every major product company in the country. That doesn't mean the product

540
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:31,680
itself has to be banned. Those things, to the extent that anything did happen,

541
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:37,440
didn't happen under my watch. The Daily Wire's first foray into the world of entertainment

542
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,520
is to ensure that the North American audience will get the chance to see a movie that would

543
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,160
have likely gone straight to video on demand. Only instead of appearing on Stars or Hulu,

544
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:51,600
Run, Hide, Fight is on the same streaming platform as video podcasts of Ben Shapiro

545
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,000
complaining about the Babysitter's Club show on Netflix.

546
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:15,120
And that seems like the perfect place for this movie.

547
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:22,240
I'm honestly surprised at how much I had to say about this movie. When I watched it,

548
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,360
it was surprisingly uninteresting. And when I watched it again the following day,

549
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,760
I was amazed at how much I had forgotten. It's surprisingly unmemorable as a movie.

550
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:38,000
Not even in a so bad it's amusing way, it's just sort of whatever. Your life will not have been

551
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,360
enriched in any way for having watched it. One thing I didn't cover in the video were the

552
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:48,880
horrible working conditions for a lot of its crew members, often paid very low wage, and they were

553
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:55,360
often asked to work very long hours. There was another incident where an older actor was

554
00:35:55,360 --> 00:36:01,440
considered too expensive to replace when after he sexually harassed some women in the makeup

555
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:06,800
department, including trying to grope one of them. According to one of the people involved,

556
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,160
Sonya's response was to suggest that the women start using the buddy system to avoid being groped.

557
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,600
There were other stories of people who hadn't gone on the record and that were tougher to source,

558
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,520
but overall they seemed like a pretty shady company, in other words a perfect fit for the

559
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:27,040
daily wire. I want to thank all my lovely patrons and members whose names are scrolling up on the
