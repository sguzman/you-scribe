0	8560	Oh god, this one is even worse.
8560	14960	When we last met, I was wading through the sewage of Ben Shapiro's 2016 novel, True
14960	15960	Allegiance.
15960	22080	In that video, I mentioned an earlier book in the Ben Shapiro-Ura, a collection of short
22080	29400	stories from 2015 titled What's Fair and Other Short Stories, released on Amazon.com
29400	30680	as an e-book.
30680	35960	This title seems to be less popular than Ben Shapiro's 2016 novel, based on its limited
35960	38280	release and lower review count.
38280	44060	It bills itself as a collection of short stories, but there are only three, which I guess meets
44060	46300	the technical definition of a collection.
46300	49520	But it makes for a far shorter read than I expected.
49520	51960	Ben's stories cover three genres.
51960	56840	There's Americana, sci-fi, and a 16-year-old's LiveJournal page.
56840	60960	But to truly see the man at his craft, we'll have to dive right in.
60960	62460	Let's go.
62460	67280	The titular story in this little tome is What's Fair.
67280	72860	In true Ben Shapiro fashion, this story feels like someone trying to cram a bad novel into
72860	78040	a few pages and reducing it to a series of basic plot points, all fired off at a rapid
78040	79200	pace.
79200	83120	This story is told through the eyes of Tommy, who relates his long and troubled history
83120	84960	with his older brother Jim.
84960	89260	The two grew up on a farm in rural America, and we get a few scenes to illustrate how
89260	93720	jealous Tommy is of Jim, typically through the framing of whether or not what happened
93720	97120	is fair, at least through Tommy's eyes.
97120	103200	The story is written with a painful, homespun narration style, as Ben tries his best to
103200	107160	make it sound like he's channeling a genuine American rustic.
107160	108160	Here's a sample.
108160	113120	I remember a time when I was a kid that Dad gave me and Jim Christmas presents.
113120	116840	He gave Jim a wristwatch and he gave me a hunting knife.
116840	119040	Boy was Jim taken with that wristwatch.
119040	124920	He'd wear it around every day, rain or shine, always careful to keep it clean, to keep it
124920	125920	wound.
125920	130520	If he scuffed it up, he'd buff that scuff right out, and he'd spend hours with a
130520	136640	handkerchief spitting on it and rubbing it, spitting on it and wiping it until it looked
136640	137640	brand new.
137640	141680	Now if that sounds like it would be annoying to read, you would be right.
141680	145000	In this story, Tommy is jealous of Jim's wristwatch.
145000	148760	And even though he tries to make the best of it by going hunting with his knife, Tommy
148760	150880	eventually loses it in a creak.
150880	153040	A detail to remember.
153040	157920	Next we flash forward in time and Tommy is a senior in high school and Jim is at a nonspecific
157920	161680	college that's only ever referred to as State.
161680	167120	Tommy has just met Emily, shortened to M. As the star fullback on his school's football
167120	172400	team, Tommy has his pick of girls, but he's settled on M, the head cheerleader.
172400	176400	He's not only sweet on her, he's convinced M is his future wife.
176400	181240	If you're rolling your eyes right now thinking this is some 1950s cliche, you'd be surprised
181240	185720	to know that this story takes place in the 90s, or at least the 90s at the very earliest
185720	190720	since Tommy refers to M as a miniature Britney Spears.
190720	194720	I'm not sure why she's miniature since a high school senior is nearly a full grown
194720	195720	adult.
195720	200480	With his parents out of town, Tommy brings M back to his place so they can hook up.
200480	205120	Instead he finds Jim has come home for the weekend from State.
205120	207520	Then we get this exchange.
207520	209600	And that's when Jim opened the door.
209600	214120	He was back from State where he was studying agriculture engineering and he looked at me
214120	218520	laughing with his eyes and said, hey brother, I'm home.
218520	221920	When I turned back to introduce M, she was looking at him.
221920	224080	They were married six months later.
224080	225920	That must have been one hell of a look.
225920	229640	And that's quite a jump for two sentences in the same paragraph.
229640	232080	We never really find out why M isn't a Jim though.
232080	233080	She just is.
233080	239080	In the next paragraph, Tommy and Jim's father dies and their mother sinks into a deep depression.
239080	243480	The farm falls into peril and Jim and M move back home to take care of things.
243480	247640	Soon afterwards, their mother tries to drown herself in the bathtub, but survives the
247640	249880	attempt and is left with brain damage.
249880	251880	And this all sounds like it's moving too quickly.
251880	255240	I've literally just covered two paragraphs of this story.
255240	258160	Its pace is manic.
258160	261640	And if you're wondering if there are any more details on the mother character, let
261640	262800	me stop you right there.
262800	266800	We don't learn a thing about who this woman is or why she does what she does.
266800	270200	She's literally just a perpetual burden on her family.
270200	271720	And she doesn't even get a name.
271720	276920	Tommy was going to be a football player at State, but he hurts his knee, losing his scholarship,
276920	278360	and he's forced to drop out.
278360	283280	And now the family is just stagnating at the farm when Jim gets this big idea.
283280	287080	He's thought of a special plow that will make the millionaires.
287080	291720	While he begins tinkering with that machine for weeks on end, all the work lends on M
291720	297000	and Tommy, who putter along muttering annoyances about the absent-minded Jim.
297000	299560	Eventually their mother starts a fire in her room.
299560	303920	Tommy and M race to help her while Jim is too busy with his machine to notice.
303920	307560	Just barely, Tommy and M are able to save Mother.
307560	312480	Tommy, obviously upset with his brother who did not notice their mother nearly burning
312480	318320	to death in her room, decides to confront Jim in a tense scene in the barn.
318320	321160	Sure enough, Jim was under that plow again.
321160	323640	I stood there for a minute, then two.
323640	327440	It must have taken the bastard five solid minutes to notice me.
327440	333040	When he did, he got out from under the plow, stood up, gave a kind of little smile, and
333040	335000	asked what was wrong.
335000	337720	And I knocked him flat on his ass.
337720	343480	Listen, Jim, I said to him, you've been having it your own way all this time, but some things
343480	345040	are gonna change.
345040	348800	You've been king of this place for our whole life, but I've had enough of it.
348800	351040	I want my peace.
351040	353160	There's so much to say about this exchange.
353160	354680	Tommy is so pissed.
354680	359800	He storms into the barn and then stands there for five minutes?
359800	362000	That doesn't seem particularly mad.
362000	366040	And then, instead of confronting Jim about his negligence nearly getting their mother
366040	370400	killed, he instead starts talking about wanting his peace.
370400	372840	Tommy never mentions his mother in this scene.
372840	378000	He just whines about things and being unfair, with Jim getting all the breaks.
378000	381840	Jim responds by turning into a character from an Ayn Rand novel.
381840	386120	Tommy, he said, you don't do anything of importance around here.
386120	388200	You think I need you to run this place?
388200	391320	I could hire a field hen for one quarter the price.
391320	393800	I'm doing it out of charity for you.
393800	395560	You've never held down a real job.
395560	399440	You're still going on and on about your days back in high school.
399440	400840	Nobody cares anymore.
400840	402340	I produce.
402340	404920	The spark in his eyes was beginning to return.
404920	407600	I knew this meant he was especially mad.
407600	408960	You aren't worth anything.
408960	410320	You've got no education.
410320	411880	You've got no prospects.
411880	414440	You know what dad told me before I left to school?
414440	416120	He said, look after Tommy.
416120	420280	If anything happens, Jimmy, he can't take care of himself.
420280	422320	Just what do you think I've been doing?
422320	426360	I started to talk, but he gave me a look that said I'd better shut my mouth.
426360	427640	He kept going.
427640	430400	You know what I've been doing in this barn all this time?
430400	434520	Trying to make something for myself and for Am, sure, but mostly I've been trying to
434520	436320	take care of you.
436320	440440	Still, even though you're sullen and you're lazy and you're ungrateful and you think
440440	445720	somehow I've cheated you, even though I spent years helping you with your homework, teaching
445720	450160	you the rules of football, hell, I even got that man from state to come see you play.
450640	454720	When this thing makes us a million bucks, I'm planning on sending you back to college
454720	456800	so you can make something of yourself.
456800	461120	But if you want to leave, you pick up and you get the hell out.
461120	463760	This diatribe reframes the entire story for us.
463760	469600	Now we see Tommy as the big dumb idiot and Jim as the smart, intelligent brother who's
469600	471600	just trying to help everyone out.
471600	473720	Tommy is just too dumb to see it.
473720	478400	Jim's kind offer to take care of his brother is supposed to make him look magnanimous.
478400	481600	Even after he basically told him he's a useless idiot.
481600	486480	Since Jim is a producer, we're supposed to think it's okay that he treats his brother
486480	488120	with such disdain.
488120	490880	And maybe Tommy is a loser.
490880	496400	Maybe his choice of focusing on athletics over academics and then him ending up getting
496400	501640	injured blew his entire future and the guy lost his high school crush to his brother.
501640	506200	Tommy has had a rough time of it and maybe he needs a reality check to snap him out of
506200	510200	this funk and get him to take responsibility for himself.
510200	513240	But you know what that speech doesn't excuse?
513240	516120	Letting your mother die in a fire.
516120	518640	That's how this critical speech completely fails.
518640	523520	If we're supposed to take Jim's side here, it would be a lot easier if he, the supposedly
523520	528760	responsible brother, hadn't nearly let his mother die in a fire.
528760	532960	Also Jim technically hasn't done all that much yet.
532960	537760	Tommy and Em run the farm and they're supposed to just assume Jim will invent their way into
537760	538760	a fortune.
538760	541720	The story gives us no reason to believe this will happen.
541720	545960	And if anything, Jim comes off as unbearably smug in this monologue.
545960	549680	So naturally, Ben has decided he's the good guy in this story.
549680	554320	After this, we move on to a scene where Tommy runs into Em late at night, finding her sobbing
554320	558840	about her miserable life as a farm wife taking care of a sick old woman.
558840	562560	Tommy figures this is a great time to talk about hooking up again.
562560	564160	Naturally, it doesn't work.
564160	569240	Embarrassed at his lack of game, Tommy runs into the woods and while passing by the creek,
569240	572560	he finds his old knife, sparkling like new.
572560	578000	I'm not sure how this knife is still in such good shape and hasn't moved in the last 15
578000	582440	years, but such is the magic of forced storytelling.
582440	586600	A few days later, Jim calls Tommy into the barn to tell him his new plow has finally
586600	587600	been finished.
587600	591440	He brings Tommy into the barn to take a look and to talk about how their lives are about
591440	595560	to take a turn for the better and then this predictable twist happens.
595560	597960	This is Tommy talking to Jim.
597960	601000	He hopped over to me like a jackrabbit and grabbed me by the arms.
601000	604360	Kiddo, we're all set from here to the flood.
604360	608240	You're a junior partner in the firm and we're headed right to the top.
608240	609720	His smile was infectious.
609720	612360	I could feel myself smiling too.
612360	614940	And then the knife was up under his ribs.
614940	617480	He looked so confused for a minute.
617480	619680	I was confused too.
619680	621120	I can explain it to you, Tommy.
621120	626200	It turns out you were in a very forced and contrived retelling of the Cain and Abel story.
626200	628080	One jealous brother murders the other.
628080	632440	Unlike Cain, though, Tommy gets away with the crime by pretending the plow is what killed
632440	633440	his brother.
633440	635800	Or at least, he seems to get away with the crime.
635800	640080	In the next scene, Tommy tries to sell the plow to make those millions, but he can't
640080	641500	get it to work.
641500	645800	Turns out there's something wrong that I guess Jim can only fix.
645800	651280	So Tommy goes home with no money and a busted plow, and eventually packs up and leaves the
651280	655960	farm and Tommy is left alone taking care of his sick mother.
655960	662160	What this story is so pointedly pressing upon us is the idea that people are born with unalterable
662160	667160	traits, essential components that make them who they are which can never be changed.
667160	670080	Tommy was born dumb and Jim was born smart.
670080	674360	Their lives reflect this internal trait and they have no way of escaping this biological
674360	675360	reality.
675360	680280	What Tommy can hope for is Jim taking care of him, and all Jim needs from Tommy is for
680280	682560	Tommy to get the hell out of his way.
682560	686840	What's most strange about this story is it pretends circumstances are meaningless and
686840	691440	that even when you have a person like Tommy who is apparently cared for, he still can't
691440	693720	escape the loneliness he was born with.
693720	698760	I'll have more to say about this idea of essentialism during the third story.
698760	704760	You know, I did like the idea of an unreliable narrator whose bias is revealed when confronting
704760	706840	the characters he covets.
706840	708880	Maybe in the hands of a talented writer?
708880	710780	This could have actually been really good.
710780	714720	But here's a spoiler for the next two stories before we get into those.
714720	718440	What's fair is easily the best story in the book.
718440	723360	And with that ominous revelation, let's move on to the next one.
723360	728920	Our next stop in the Shapiroverse is the science fiction story From the Pit.
728920	734100	This is a tale of the far future where our hero, a man named Kemp, is fighting for his
734100	739380	survival against hordes of dust mites for the sake of his rich benefactor.
739380	741540	And yes, I did say dust mites.
741540	747400	In this vision of the future, a wealthy man, only referred to as the whale, hires thousands
747400	751940	of people to be shrunk down to less than a millimeter, which is about four hundredths
751940	755140	of an inch, so they can shoot dust mites in the face.
755140	759260	Now before we continue with the plot, I need to acknowledge that this is maybe the dumbest
759260	761980	plan to eliminate dust mites I've ever heard.
761980	766180	Why not, say, make the humans big enough that the dust mites can't harm them and
766180	768100	just spray them like roaches?
768100	772400	Why not skip shrinking humans entirely and use chemicals from the get-go?
772400	775500	Why not just write a story that doesn't have such a bad premise?
775500	779820	Of all the stories in this collection, this one is in the most desperate need of some
779820	780820	copy editing.
780820	783300	Here's an actual sentence from the story.
783300	784800	Two years.
784800	788260	That was the length of that damnable contract.
788260	790780	I though the money would enough.
790780	792460	Did no one read this over?
792460	795460	I though the money would enough.
795460	801280	And the rest of the paragraph reads, a guaranteed pension for life, an endless income, a nice
801280	807340	house above the bay with the wind blowing off the sea, Amy in my arms.
807340	809940	She warned me against this.
809940	811540	She was right.
811540	814300	I was wrong.
814300	818340	Sentences either run on for way too long or they're too short and snippy.
818340	823080	It doesn't use commas properly and I though the money would enough.
823080	826900	And don't worry, that's not even the worst grammatical flub in this story.
826900	828660	But back to the plot.
828660	833020	Kemp pines for Amy, an absent love interest that reminds us he has something to live for
833020	836140	in light of the horrors that come.
836140	840620	Kemp fights a bunch of dust mites in a confusing battle scene where he's hanging off the side
840620	846460	of a cigarette when the whale, a clean freak who is also a compulsive smoker, decides to
846460	848740	light up the cigarette and take a drag.
848740	853380	In the chaos, Kemp falls into the whale's mouth and thanks to his little protective
853380	858860	bubble called a halo, he manages to affix himself to the side of the whale's stomach.
858860	863940	A man trapped in the belly of a whale is an obvious reference to the story of Jonah and
863940	866380	the whale from the Old Testament.
866380	871180	In that story, after Jonah turned his back on his mission as a prophet, God had him swallowed
871180	874100	up for a few days by a giant fish.
874100	877100	Jonah eventually is thrown up and then becomes a prophet.
877100	881440	In this story, Kemp is learning the error of wanting to make money from a rich guy who
881440	884500	has a really weird method of killing dust mites.
884500	886760	So not exactly the same.
886760	889040	Or similar.
889040	892980	While sitting in the stomach, Kemp sees the awful truth about the whale.
892980	894440	He has a tumor.
894440	898540	And an ulcer, which is something I'm just mentioning because it'll be used as a plot
898540	900140	device later on.
900140	903060	Somehow Kemp knows the tumor is really bad.
903060	905900	So bad that the whale will be dead in a couple of months.
905900	910400	We haven't gotten any information that Kemp has any sort of medical training or knowledge.
910400	913060	This is just something he knows.
913060	917220	This knowledge about the tumor could make Kemp fabulously wealthy.
917220	920500	And that does make sense knowing that some big important business dude is going to be
920500	924100	dead in a couple of months is prime blackmail material.
924100	928020	Kemp though isn't a bastard and doesn't want to take advantage of this situation.
928020	932700	Kemp radios his buddy Jensen, letting him know he's trapped in the stomach and that
932700	934580	he's seen the whale's tumor.
934580	937700	He promises not to say a word about it to anyone.
937700	942500	Jensen tries speaking to the whale, but he doesn't believe Kemp and decides he's just
942500	943980	going to kill him.
943980	949220	It's at this point in the story where we get a truly mystifying line that, I suspect, is
949220	951260	the subtext for this entire story.
951260	955600	I'm going to be a bit of a jerk though and not reveal it until we get to the very end.
955600	961320	As we move along, try and guess what this story is secretly an allegory for.
961320	966040	The whale calls a doctor to have Kemp killed, and their plan is to send in robotic dust
966040	968400	mites to hunt him down.
968400	973200	These were going to eventually replace shrinking humans down to fight dust mites, and I don't
973200	977780	know why they just didn't start with the robots, but this is the story we have.
977780	981480	Inside the stomach, Kemp has decided he's just going to let himself grow back to full
981480	984040	size and rip his way out of the whale.
984040	987960	And to do that, he's going to have to fight his way through the robotic dust mites.
987960	994080	Reversion to his normal size is a gradual process for Kemp, so at this point, he's
994080	999520	about twice his starting size, so probably one tenth of an inch, assuming he started
999520	1002440	off as slightly larger than a dust mite.
1002440	1007520	As the dust mites tear open the halo protecting Kemp, he comes out fighting, kicking his way
1007520	1009960	past them and climbing up the stomach lining.
1010040	1015600	Of course, since his tiny little clothes have all ripped off, he's doing it naked, burning
1015600	1017680	his hands and feet on the stomach lining.
1017680	1023120	As he climbs into the esophagus, one of the dust mites bites off Kemp's leg.
1023120	1025760	Then we get this doozy of a typo.
1025760	1030680	For context, Kemp is pulling himself into the esophagus, which looks like a constricting
1030680	1032520	ring from his perspective.
1032520	1039160	Finally, I pry the damn thing open, pull myself halfway through, and it closes around
1039160	1040160	my waist.
1040160	1044280	I'm trapped, the clicking sounds of the mites closer and closer.
1044280	1049000	I'm sorry, it closes around your… what?
1049000	1050480	Your waist?
1050480	1057760	Is Kemp in the process of relieving his bowels here, or did someone just not know how to
1057760	1058760	spell waist?
1059320	1063120	Of course, I'm sure Ben knows how to spell waist properly.
1063120	1066880	This just speaks to the importance of copy editors and how they're your friends, and
1066880	1071120	if you employ one and have them look over your work, they'll keep it from looking
1071120	1073120	like waist.
1073120	1078640	Somehow Kemp pulls himself to safety and uses what's left of the stomach acid to cauterize
1078640	1079880	the wound.
1079880	1085640	Of course, acid liquefies flesh, making it a horrible fluid to cauterize anything.
1085640	1091200	Missing a leg and sitting in the esophagus, Kemp decides he'll have a little nap.
1091200	1095200	And by little nap, I mean really long sleep.
1095200	1096200	September 23rd.
1096200	1099400	I've lost all sense of time.
1099400	1105760	I can tell by my size, I'm now about 3 inches tall, that it's been another 36 hours.
1105760	1110960	How can you lose all sense of time and then be able to tell it's been 36 hours?
1110960	1116440	And how on earth did the whale go 36 hours without eating any food that would have surely
1116440	1118040	dislodged Kemp?
1118040	1126400	And how did he sleep, I guess standing up, in the esophagus, missing a leg for 36 hours?
1126400	1130960	It's at this point Kemp revises his plan, instead opting to climb out of the esophagus
1130960	1134120	instead of just bursting through the whale's guts.
1134120	1139400	And we get this funny little scene where Kemp punches the whale from inside of his throat.
1139400	1143840	It's stupid and random, but it's the only part of the story I liked, it's just this
1143840	1147520	adorably pathetic little gesture of a tiny man.
1147520	1153200	The whale gets desperate and the doctor pulls out their trump card, some Ipecac, which will
1153200	1154520	induce vomiting.
1154520	1158520	By vomiting up that stomach acid, it would burn Kemp to death.
1158520	1163200	Kemp thinks quickly and decides to go back into the stomach, this time with a plan.
1163200	1166640	He heads towards the ulcer, remember that thing from a little earlier?
1166640	1171240	He starts tearing at it, getting it to start bleeding, and for some reason this attracts
1171240	1172800	all the robotic dust mites.
1172800	1177880	I don't know how Kemp knew this would happen, or why it happens at all, but it does.
1177880	1181480	Here's a fun fact, dust mites don't drink blood.
1181480	1186040	Maybe the robotic ones are different, but I'm not sure why anyone would program them
1186040	1191360	to drink human blood, that seems like a weird thing to program a robot to do.
1191360	1193600	But now let's think about this plan for a moment.
1193600	1198120	When it begins, the doctor has already given the whale the Ipecac, and according to Kemp,
1198120	1201080	he has seconds to pull all of this off.
1201080	1206400	Just a few seconds now before the geyser of acidic vomit comes up, finishing me.
1206400	1211240	I rub my right leg, what's left of it, and look down through the ring.
1211240	1216600	Ipecac is washing through the stomach, and mechanical mites are swimming around in it.
1216600	1223000	Soon they'll be joining me, along with the acid, unless I join the bursts.
1223000	1227040	The ulcer, it's the only chance.
1227040	1230840	Kemp somehow knew to use the robotic dust mites to attack the ulcer.
1230840	1236020	He somehow knew the doctor would then, on the spot, decide to cut open the whale to
1236020	1240600	get it out, and in that whole mess, Kemp would jump to freedom.
1240600	1244740	And that's the genius plan that Kemp just came up with on the spot.
1244740	1250560	And what about that impending vomit after the whale swallows the Ipecac?
1250560	1256360	I think Ben just kind of forgot about it, because it's never mentioned.
1256360	1260040	Kemp was in the stomach the whole time, so it would have killed him.
1260040	1263560	The impending vomit acid just never arrives.
1263560	1269560	Also, it's really impressive that Kemp pulls off this entire plan with one leg.
1269560	1272320	That's one heck of a plan coming together.
1272320	1276440	The story ends with the whale demanding that the doctor kill Kemp, but Jensen decides to
1276440	1278960	murder the doctor instead to save his friend.
1278960	1284040	The whale, who at no point vomits in this story, presumably bleeds out because he has
1284040	1286800	a giant hole in his stomach.
1286800	1290720	So with the story now told, have you figured out the subtext?
1290720	1295720	It's really tough, because even when you know and you can see the connections more clearly,
1295720	1297440	it still doesn't make any sense.
1297440	1300800	I'm going to read this revealing passage for you now.
1300800	1305700	This is a conversation the whale has with Jensen after he decides to murder Kemp.
1305700	1308980	Kemp is listening to this conversation from inside the stomach.
1308980	1314780	Jensen swallows, I can hear it all the way across the room, not even through the beacon.
1314780	1319860	Sir, he says, that would be pure murder.
1319860	1326500	Yes, says the whale, but it's my body, and what's in it is my purview.
1326500	1327500	That's the law.
1327500	1332220	Look it up, but look it up after you call the doctor.
1332220	1335260	This story is about abortion.
1335260	1338700	Yeah, that basically gives it all away, huh?
1338700	1344260	So now do we talk about how a living being grows inside a person, or there's a caesarean
1344260	1350120	operation, or a doctor is being called upon to be complicit in murder?
1350120	1355460	Sometimes a story's narrative is so bad, so clumsy, and falls so hard on its face that
1355460	1360740	the only fitting criticism is to tell everybody what happens in it.
1360740	1363860	So let's move on to the next story.
1363860	1368860	Utopia is the shortest of the three stories, and easily the worst one, mostly because it's
1368860	1374180	not really a story, just a drab portrait of what Ben believes a socialist utopia would
1374180	1375420	look like.
1375420	1380600	One where everyone lives the same life, with every part of it decided for them by the government.
1380600	1386100	Our hero is a nameless protagonist who lives in this sheltered society trapped in a giant
1386100	1388500	bubble cut off from the rest of the world.
1388500	1393340	He goes about his drab life working at some random factory where his job is turning to
1393340	1395180	spigot on and off.
1395180	1400220	On Wednesdays he plays cards with some strangers, Tuesdays he hooks up with a random woman,
1400220	1403340	and on Thursdays he goes out and looks at the stars.
1403340	1408540	Ben gives us a world where there are no relationships, not romantic ones, and not even friendships.
1408540	1413020	This socialist utopia means giving up all those things as people come and go out of
1413020	1416060	your life and no meaningful connection is ever made.
1416060	1422180	On one of his stargazing nights, our protagonist looks up at the sky and notices a comet streaking
1422180	1423180	through the night.
1423180	1427540	It happens to be Haley's comet, which passes by every 75 years, although this only gets
1427540	1429420	revealed a little bit later on.
1429420	1433900	Somehow, seeing this comet awaken something in our protagonist.
1433900	1435660	Here's how the book describes it.
1435660	1439420	And suddenly, his hazy dream burst into consciousness.
1439420	1444700	He found himself standing, tears rolling down his face, gazing up at the sky, a terrible
1444700	1450740	longing filled him, a feeling of dread and of hope, a new feeling, an old feeling.
1450740	1454820	The star tore the night apart, leaving day falling behind it.
1454820	1459780	When he looked around him, he saw thousands of eyes and thousands of faces staring at
1459780	1461780	him, blankly.
1461780	1463940	The star hit the horizon.
1463940	1466700	He turned and ran.
1466700	1469060	Every line is so breathless in Ben's writing.
1469060	1473980	It's like he imagines every story to be utterly captivating and demands the reader being thralled
1473980	1475500	along with him.
1475500	1481580	This reader was annoyed by the tiny sentences that never offered anything of depth or value.
1481580	1487260	There are just these tiny little descriptions of plot points, only filled with the barest,
1487260	1491740	scantest of details that seem completely perfunctory.
1491740	1494020	And what exactly is happening in this moment?
1494020	1497660	A transformation, yes, but how and why?
1497660	1500700	And what exactly is changing here?
1500700	1503420	Let's see if the story will answer that for us.
1503420	1507700	The protagonist's dash is immediately noticed by the Ministry of Protection.
1507700	1511660	There are a lot of ministries in this book, but this is the only one that actually does
1511660	1512660	anything.
1512660	1515820	Several enforcers are dispatched to chase after the protagonist.
1515820	1520580	They try using this thing called the pulse, which is some kind of weapon that uses sound
1520580	1522220	to incapacitate people.
1522220	1525940	When they try using it on our protagonist, this happens.
1525940	1528220	Behind him, the pulse crescendoed.
1528220	1533140	He could feel the hair on his arm stand on end, his knees begin to buckle.
1533140	1538700	Soon, he knew, his legs would give out, his head fry from the pulse.
1538700	1543620	Yes, his head fry from the pulse, good copy editing there, by the way.
1543620	1545120	But it didn't.
1545120	1548800	The enforcer's eyes widened in shock as the pod approached.
1548800	1554300	He was well within range of the pulse now, yet nothing was happening, nothing.
1554300	1559140	Another enforcement pod opened up with the pulse, full bore, nothing.
1559140	1561420	A smile creased his worn face.
1561420	1564140	He slowed to a jog, then a walk.
1564140	1569420	Then, finally, he stopped dead and turned around, facing his pursuers.
1569420	1575260	As he did, the pods backed away, as though called away by some higher power.
1575260	1577980	He turned again and ran toward the mountain.
1577980	1583980	I have no idea why this pulse, which we've not heard about until now, doesn't work.
1583980	1585180	It just doesn't.
1585180	1587360	And this is never explained in the story.
1587360	1590740	And this mountain location is mentioned for the first time right here.
1590740	1595340	I don't know why the protagonist knows to just run towards it, but that's what's happening.
1595340	1599300	What's even funnier is that Ben doesn't even know how his protagonist knows about
1599300	1600300	the mountain.
1600300	1602780	He didn't know how he knew about the mountain.
1602780	1605440	The Ministry of Environment never talked about it.
1605440	1609060	Nobody knew the words mountain or valley.
1609060	1612940	He couldn't even see the mountain thanks to the bubble, the protective climate change,
1612940	1620020	the artificial environment that made all land even and flat, fruitful and evenly graded.
1620020	1622980	Nobody he knew had ever been outside the bubble.
1622980	1627220	The protagonist runs towards the mountain, but is stopped by the dome of his enclosure.
1627220	1631540	Eventually, for unnamed reasons, the doorway is opened and the protagonist is allowed to
1631540	1632880	approach the mountain.
1632880	1638020	As he approaches, the protagonist sees a sign that reads, The Creed of Ignorance.
1638020	1642100	This for the unfamiliar is how Winston Churchill referred to socialism.
1642100	1647580	The full quote reads, socialism is the philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance and the
1647580	1649420	gospel of envy.
1649420	1653540	Why would socialists put up part of a quote that makes them sound like the bad guys?
1653540	1656100	And that quote basically encapsulates this story.
1656100	1659420	People living in this socialist utopia all think they're happy, but they're actually
1659420	1664260	under a mass delusion that our nameless protagonist has broken out of, somehow.
1664260	1666180	Let's read on and see if we get an answer to that.
1666180	1668180	He probably guessed we aren't though, right?
1668180	1670020	Yeah, he probably figured that out.
1670020	1674020	A chamber inside the mountain houses an old man and his many books.
1674020	1678220	He's bedridden and just kind of lame there when our protagonist finds him, and the two
1678220	1680260	have a weighty conversation.
1680260	1683940	Here's the closest we get to understanding what sent our protagonist on his journey.
1683940	1684940	Halley's Comet.
1684940	1687980	I know you don't know what that is, never mind about that.
1687980	1691340	Suffice it to say that it shows up once every 75 years.
1691340	1694980	Your father and mother must have seen it at some point.
1694980	1696700	At that he spoke.
1696700	1699140	I never knew my father and mother.
1699140	1701140	But you remember the comment.
1701140	1703820	I don't know what I remember.
1703820	1705240	And then they move on.
1705240	1711540	If you want answers to nonsensical plot twists, or in this case, the entire premise, Ben Shapiro
1711540	1713260	isn't the writer for you.
1713260	1717620	But maybe I'm being nitpicky, it might not matter what brought us to this point.
1717620	1722120	We have a social outcast from a socialist society who's confronting a man revealed
1722120	1724480	to be one of that society's architects.
1724480	1729020	This is the moment this was all building to, so maybe it'll pay off and of course it's
1729020	1731720	not going to pay off, but let's find out what happens.
1731720	1736200	In the minds of the socialist, according to the story, the problem is diversity.
1736200	1739740	The differences between people create strife and discord.
1739740	1741460	Let's let the old man explain it.
1741460	1747100	For no matter what measures government tried, inequality remained, redistribution of resources
1747100	1748860	merely masked the problem.
1748860	1754580	Laws directed toward helping particular groups often ended with them being strangely disadvantaged.
1754580	1757900	Different abilities bred different values, different belief systems.
1757900	1760820	Those values and systems caused conflict.
1760820	1762800	We tried everything to solve it.
1762800	1764180	We tried education.
1764180	1768460	We tried genetic treatments designed to raise the average intelligence.
1768460	1772100	But each IQ point meant a massive difference in outcome.
1772100	1774340	There's something very sinister happening here.
1774340	1777180	And I don't just mean the swipe at the welfare state.
1777180	1781860	What Ben is presenting to us is a reading of diversity amongst cultures as the product
1781860	1783660	of genetic differences.
1783660	1787740	That is to say, the reason some societies differ from others, and more importantly,
1787740	1793000	why some societies perform better than others, is because of their genes.
1793000	1799500	This story is resting very heavily on the idea that some people, or in this case, some
1799500	1804020	groups of people, are simply born better than others.
1804020	1810220	And he pulls it out to mean that this is a product of our genes, and is completely inescapable,
1810220	1812220	regardless of how we engineer society.
1812220	1817180	It completely disregards history, environments, both physical and social.
1817180	1822540	If some cultures do better than others, ultimately, it can only be explained because their people
1822540	1824740	are genetically superior.
1824740	1828460	If we don't want to talk about culture, we can also talk about class.
1828460	1833300	Rich people are rich because they have superior genes compared to poor people.
1833300	1835860	They were simply born to be better.
1835860	1840220	In this story, because the old man specifically refers to breeding programs that needed to
1840220	1846300	be used to filter out the differences between people, it's literally talking about eugenics.
1846300	1850500	The line towards race realism here is pretty direct.
1850500	1854740	For those who don't know, race realism is a pseudoscience that tries to justify racism
1854740	1859940	through a misunderstanding of genetics and overemphasis on arbitrary physical characteristics.
1859940	1864340	I don't want to get too sidetracked here, but if you want to know why this is nonsense,
1864340	1867460	I've included a few links in the description below.
1867460	1872560	It's all nonsense, and it's used to explain away some of history's worst crimes.
1872560	1876020	The old man describes his ideals.
1876020	1877900	Equality is the key.
1877900	1879840	Equality cannot be achieved in excellence.
1879840	1882900	It can only be achieved in mediocrity.
1882900	1885700	And we have achieved it within the bubble.
1885700	1886900	All are equal.
1886900	1887900	All want nothing.
1887900	1888900	Aspire to nothing.
1888900	1889900	It is perfect.
1889900	1891540	It is stasis.
1891540	1893100	It took generations.
1893100	1896460	Three generations to breed out the intelligent, to select out the unique.
1896460	1900020	We have more disease now, but we have no unhappiness.
1900020	1903420	More poverty now, but shared by all.
1903420	1907500	This operation to create equality didn't take with our protagonist, though.
1907500	1912260	When the old man tells him happiness is a myth, then nothing can make man happy because
1912260	1917260	of our internal desires to do better, and eventually failing, becoming unhappy, the
1917260	1921500	protagonist responds, no, he said.
1921500	1924460	It is happiness to be so unhappy.
1924460	1929420	What he's saying so clumsily is the pursuit of greatness, even if it falls short, is what
1929420	1930780	makes people happy.
1930780	1934100	Maybe because we fall short and always have something to strive towards.
1934100	1938620	Although I'm putting words in his mouth a little here, especially with that last sentence.
1938620	1942700	Because instead of getting more detail, but what I suspect is the whole point of the story,
1942700	1945260	we get a cringy action scene instead.
1945260	1949180	Two enforcers have showed up to the mountain to take our protagonist away.
1949180	1954740	The old man has decided an independent man like our protagonist is trouble.
1954740	1957140	Here's one really bad part.
1957140	1960220	It's describing the actions of our protagonist in this scene.
1960220	1963540	He leapt to the bookcase, his hand gripped a volume.
1963540	1968060	The penta took, it said, and he pulled it from the bookcase.
1968060	1970160	The withered man was screaming now.
1970160	1972480	In anger or despair, he could not tell.
1972480	1977060	He swung the heavy volume, metal edged at the other enforcer, who was moving towards
1977060	1979540	him with a slow certitude.
1979540	1984740	The book crunched into the enforcer's skull, and he toppled to the floor with a crash.
1984740	1989700	For the unfamiliar, the penta took are the first five books on the Old Testament.
1989700	1995460	Yeah, this story literally has someone being beaten to death with a holy book.
1995460	1998620	Subtle, this story is not.
1998620	2002740	The protagonist confronts the old man, accusing him of ruining mankind's potential, and then
2002740	2005540	he uses a pillow to smother the old man's scene.
2005540	2008020	You protected us from our humanity.
2008020	2012580	From our possibility, may God, the word jumped again to his mouth.
2012580	2014860	May God forgive you.
2014860	2019380	In one fell swoop, our protagonist has found God and killed his oppressor.
2019380	2023260	And the story ends with him wandering off into the wilderness to see if there are other
2023260	2026340	painfully contrived morality tales he can appear in.
2026340	2030780	One of the biggest problems this story has is that there's no internal logic to the
2030780	2031780	plot.
2031780	2034180	The main character realizes something somehow.
2034180	2038340	He is pursued until he isn't, and then he is again.
2038340	2041260	And he knows about places before knowing about them.
2041260	2045140	That last part in particular is a problem, since so much of this story is dedicated to
2045140	2047300	describing the main character's ignorance.
2047300	2050620	He doesn't know what ants are, he's never seen books, he doesn't know what mountains
2050620	2055980	are, he doesn't know what a comet is, but he knows the mountain when he needs to, and
2055980	2059740	he knows anything he needs to know when the plot requires him to.
2059740	2065740	When he realizes that his life is unfulfilling and makes him unhappy, the story is trying
2065740	2070780	to convey this inner truth as if the knowledge of wanting more out of life is some kind of
2070780	2074060	natural impulse that can't be extinguished, only hidden.
2074060	2078700	It's not a terrible point, but the problem is here, in the story of free will and not
2078700	2083340	having life dictated to you by the government, ironically makes its protagonist seem like
2083340	2087100	a marionette dancing on its author's strings.
2087100	2093580	How can this be a story of free will and self-determination when it's so painfully contrived and forced?
2093580	2097980	This is how terrible writing can ultimately undermine any point an author is trying to
2097980	2098980	make.
2098980	2103460	The worldview here is ultimately one built on selfishness and tribalism.
2103460	2108260	It not only seems to be fine with one group of people having a higher concentration of
2108260	2113580	wealth to the detriment of others, it also says that they are inherently worthy of that
2113580	2115500	higher position in society.
2115500	2121180	Think back to the talk about diversity creating strife because some groups have superior genes.
2121180	2123860	This is presented as the natural order.
2123860	2127620	In this story's world, socialists are trying to upset a natural order where the superior
2127620	2131420	people make more money and the inferior ones live in squalor.
2131420	2136060	It's a full-throated defense of capitalism, using racist pseudoscience as an excuse for
2136060	2138580	not having to care about the poor.
2138580	2141060	And it's a pretty terrible short story too.
2141060	2146220	Part of me wants to look back and have some sort of grand conclusion now that I've read
2146220	2152420	the complete works of Ben Shapiro's fiction, but a bigger part of me would like to simply
2152420	2156500	fade away and never think about this dark period in my life.
2156500	2161500	Although if he publishes another book, I will definitely, definitely be reading it.
2161500	2164700	Not buying it, but definitely reading it.
2164700	2165700	Whew.
2165700	2170740	So yeah, another Ben Shapiro literature adventure for all of you.
2170740	2176940	For those wondering, I did not purchase this short story collection and I very much recommend
2176940	2179300	against doing that.
2179300	2182740	It's very bad and you would be giving a bad man money.
2182740	2183740	Don't do it.
2183740	2187420	Not all of my videos are going to be about terrible, conservative fiction in the future.
2187420	2191540	I might do a few now and then if anything catches my eye.
2191540	2197860	The names you see on the screen are my lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely patrons.

2205220	2211180	I know these videos don't look like it, but they do actually cost time and money to produce.
2211180	2216140	So anyone who would like to contribute to helping me make more videos, I very much
2216140	2217380	am grateful for that support.
