00:00.000 --> 00:07.620
The world is weird, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it, with Jose.

00:07.620 --> 00:12.900
In the first episode of the 1999 animated series Futurama, a delivery boy named Fry

00:12.900 --> 00:16.340
gets transported 1,000 years into the future.

00:16.340 --> 00:20.660
When he's outfitted for a chip that will forever brand him as a delivery boy, it's

00:20.660 --> 00:25.740
done so under the auspices of the motto, you gotta do what you gotta do.

00:25.740 --> 00:29.500
This image perfectly captures the idea of being swallowed up by a system that will make

00:29.500 --> 00:34.060
every decision for you, and you can only resign yourself to the idea that this is how

00:34.060 --> 00:36.340
the world works.

00:36.340 --> 00:41.340
Terms like these carry this deep resignation that the world is the way it is, and change

00:41.340 --> 00:44.220
just isn't gonna happen.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.740
Some of the most popular political content on YouTube can fall under the category of

00:47.740 --> 00:53.660
owning the libs, anti-SJW commentary, taking down the right, or some other adversarial

00:53.660 --> 00:54.660
position.

00:54.660 --> 00:58.740
It tries to create the idea of a political position not so much around what a person

00:58.740 --> 01:03.140
believes, but what that person perceives themselves as standing up against.

01:03.140 --> 01:06.860
Over the past few weeks, some of the major controversies in the social media space have

01:06.860 --> 01:12.180
been manufactured nonsense, from the potato head rebranding to some old Dr. Seuss book

01:12.180 --> 01:16.260
no longer being published, but you can see similar narratives cropping around real stories,

01:16.260 --> 01:18.580
such as the recent shooting in Atlanta.

01:18.580 --> 01:22.420
Discussions about issues regarding the LGBT community, race, and gender are immediately

01:22.420 --> 01:23.520
waved aside.

01:23.520 --> 01:27.020
The problem isn't just that figures on the right lie about this stuff, the bigger issue

01:27.020 --> 01:30.180
is that they're telling their audience that it's not something worth caring about to

01:30.180 --> 01:35.340
begin with, and those who do claim to care about it are either hypocrites or cultists.

01:35.340 --> 01:38.580
The innuendo studio's YouTube channel has a couple of videos on this topic from its

01:38.580 --> 01:42.740
alt-right playbook series, particularly how rhetoric is used to control conversations

01:42.740 --> 01:44.740
using a barrage of accusations.

01:44.740 --> 01:48.140
It's why so many of the stories I mentioned above are always framed as attacks.

01:48.140 --> 01:52.220
It's never an issue explored, it's always phrased as the left, or hysterical and out

01:52.220 --> 01:56.380
of control when no one would even know about these issues if it wasn't for some right-wing

01:56.380 --> 01:58.340
loudmouth bringing them up first.

01:58.340 --> 02:02.700
What I want to focus on is not just how the right engages with this debate, but how there's

02:02.700 --> 02:08.400
this implicit effort to get people to disengage entirely from the world of politics.

02:08.400 --> 02:11.820
One of the most effective ways of controlling public conversation is convincing people not

02:11.820 --> 02:14.620
to engage in it, at least not honestly.

02:14.620 --> 02:18.380
Back when I made my big video on Dave Rubin many years ago, one of the weirdest things

02:18.380 --> 02:22.300
about his content was how often he said he didn't want to be talking about politics.

02:22.300 --> 02:26.100
It's a line I saw repeated by the likes of Tim Poole, The Quartering, or anyone who

02:26.100 --> 02:28.460
serves a young right-wing audience.

02:28.460 --> 02:31.780
This idea that they really wish they didn't have to talk about any of this stuff, but

02:31.780 --> 02:35.680
if it wasn't just for those darn people on the left, we could ignore it and go back

02:35.680 --> 02:37.820
to talking about fun things.

02:37.820 --> 02:42.780
Carried with that is this idea that caring about this stuff is not really worthy of attention,

02:42.780 --> 02:47.020
if not for the rabble-rousers, who are supposedly not coming from an honest place.

02:47.020 --> 02:49.780
And the reason they tell their audience to care about now is because it's a threat

02:49.780 --> 02:51.260
to the status quo.

02:51.260 --> 02:55.900
State into this mindset is the idea that the world is essentially buying the way it

02:55.900 --> 02:56.900
is.

02:56.900 --> 03:01.460
Injustices are rare, local, and handled by the systems we have in place.

03:01.460 --> 03:05.940
Maybe we need some tweaks, sometimes there's a bad apple, but things are actually pretty

03:05.940 --> 03:10.620
good right now and we don't have to worry about any sort of systemic changes.

03:10.620 --> 03:14.580
If someone feels satisfied in their life, they're a lot less likely to become politically

03:14.580 --> 03:15.580
active.

03:15.580 --> 03:19.180
And if they're told the world is fine, aside from the rabble-rousers, that's another incentive

03:19.180 --> 03:23.220
to just tune out and not really engage with politics.

03:23.220 --> 03:27.100
And I know that sounds counterproductive if you're trying to win an election, but it

03:27.100 --> 03:31.820
also pairs with the fact that some people know there are problems in their lives and

03:31.820 --> 03:36.060
the world isn't perfectly fine when there are people who are struggling.

03:36.060 --> 03:39.780
Most of those problems will be filed under the idea that this is just the way the world

03:39.780 --> 03:43.300
works, best to just accept it, be a grownup, and move on.

03:43.300 --> 03:47.100
But if the person is still annoyed because, well, there's a lot about the world that

03:47.100 --> 03:49.620
sucks, a villain needs to be created.

03:49.620 --> 03:53.540
So if anything bad happens, it's probably the left's fault.

03:53.540 --> 03:57.940
Their audience is motivated into action only against the perceived threat to their status

03:57.940 --> 03:58.940
quo.

03:58.940 --> 04:01.340
Things were always fine before they changed.

04:01.340 --> 04:05.500
That's the essence of right-wing messaging, because, of course, it's maintaining the

04:05.500 --> 04:09.340
status quo or possibly some reactionary stuff to move things backwards.

04:09.340 --> 04:11.340
It's never the system that's the problem.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.020
It's the bad actor or actors who have ruined it.

04:14.020 --> 04:17.820
It's how an unjust police killing is framed as one bad apple rather than symbolic of

04:17.820 --> 04:19.220
a systemic problem.

04:19.220 --> 04:23.140
Or if a scientific body is saying you need to change how you think about something, it's

04:23.140 --> 04:25.900
probably been infiltrated by some provocateurs.

04:25.900 --> 04:27.420
The system is fine.

04:27.420 --> 04:31.800
It's just some rotten agents who have somehow corrupted it from within.

04:31.800 --> 04:35.340
And if we just get rid of a couple of bad people, we can go back to not talking about

04:35.340 --> 04:40.220
these things and not really caring, because things are fine in the status quo.

04:40.220 --> 04:44.020
That's why the aforementioned controversies are framed as an attack by the left.

04:44.020 --> 04:47.020
They're signaling to their audience that caring about this stuff is silly, and only

04:47.020 --> 04:48.980
silly people on the left do it.

04:48.980 --> 04:53.700
But if we let this slide, we could very well end up in some kind of 1984-esque hellscape.

04:53.700 --> 04:59.780
Notice that, in all of that rhetoric, no political actions are really espoused aside from some

04:59.780 --> 05:02.860
vague references to principles like free speech.

05:02.860 --> 05:08.100
There are no policy ideas or broader initiatives, just a vague hatred for the other side, because

05:08.340 --> 05:12.660
why would you need to motivate someone into political action when your politics are based

05:12.660 --> 05:14.500
on keeping things the same?

05:14.500 --> 05:18.020
Here's what apathetic political engagement would look like.

05:18.020 --> 05:23.260
One morning, there will be a story all over social media about how the left, those scoundrels,

05:23.260 --> 05:26.660
have decided that Paddington Bear is now a female bear.

05:26.660 --> 05:31.580
The right-wing Pundo Sphere, all in unison, will start talking about how the left is out

05:31.580 --> 05:37.380
of control, and if this is to stand, soon the nation and the West will all fall.

05:37.380 --> 05:40.380
When the audience laps it up, they might even up with their donations.

05:40.380 --> 05:44.700
The mainstream press reports on it, with some confusion as to why anyone would care about

05:44.700 --> 05:48.220
this, but still, you know, reporting on it because they're hungry for the ratings.

05:48.220 --> 05:52.220
And this eventually filters up to opportunistic politicians, who will give speeches designed

05:52.220 --> 05:57.620
specifically for Twitter, where they decry that poor Paddington Bear will now be a she

05:57.620 --> 05:59.460
instead of a he.

05:59.460 --> 06:03.020
The big winners in all of this are the right-wing media people who get clicks, the mainstream

06:03.020 --> 06:06.340
media who get ratings, and politicians who might get a few votes.

06:06.340 --> 06:10.700
A few votes, by the way, based on sharing a common interest, not because they're proposing

06:10.700 --> 06:15.820
some kind of Paddington-centric legislation, or even if they draw up that bill because

06:15.820 --> 06:20.340
the story lasts a little longer than New Cycle than most, it'll probably be shot down and

06:20.340 --> 06:24.300
quickly forgotten because, really, this is all performance theater.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.280
What exactly are the politics of all of this?

06:27.280 --> 06:32.220
As best I can tell from this scenario I just made up, it would be that the left is terrible

06:32.220 --> 06:36.660
and trying to change things, when things should never be changed, with subtle digs

06:36.660 --> 06:39.960
at women and the LGBT community for good measure.

06:39.960 --> 06:46.240
This isn't really a coherent political ideology, it's just a brief exercise of rage designed

06:46.240 --> 06:50.780
to whip everyone into a frenzy before they settle back down and go back to the world

06:50.780 --> 06:53.260
ready to let it resume unchanged.

06:53.260 --> 06:56.600
It's basically the two-minute hate from 1984.

06:56.600 --> 07:01.140
And I now demand bonus points for making a 1984 reference that isn't completely played

07:01.140 --> 07:03.900
out and actually makes sense.

07:03.900 --> 07:08.920
Politics should be about something, you know, a goal, some kind of achievable end.

07:08.920 --> 07:14.120
This anger that's stoked is designed to get people riled up without them actually channeling

07:14.120 --> 07:16.120
that anger to something constructive.

07:16.120 --> 07:20.200
Aside from, you know, providing monetary support to the right-wing media system and voting

07:20.200 --> 07:23.160
for politicians who will do absolutely nothing for them.

07:23.160 --> 07:26.560
In one of the rare instances where one of these stories can break through, it's in

07:26.560 --> 07:30.680
service to a power structure trying to maintain the status quo, such as a government pressure

07:30.700 --> 07:35.260
in a university to remove certain courses from its curriculum or removing training that

07:35.260 --> 07:38.220
raises issues of systemic inequalities.

07:38.220 --> 07:42.480
Political victory here looks like silencing the other side of the debate in an effort

07:42.480 --> 07:44.720
to maintain the status quo.

07:44.720 --> 07:49.420
This is also why conservative commentators often frame their critiques of these issues

07:49.420 --> 07:50.420
so dishonestly.

07:50.420 --> 07:54.560
They present these issues to their audience as nonsensical as a way of signaling to them

07:54.560 --> 07:57.980
that these issues can be safely ignored and discarded.

07:57.980 --> 08:02.420
Giving these ideas honestly would force this side to genuinely engage with them, but by

08:02.420 --> 08:06.980
not doing that, they can infectively make their audience misinformed, disengaged, and

08:06.980 --> 08:09.960
apathetic towards any sort of social change.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.800
Another way this takes shape that's very similar to apathy is cynicism.

08:12.800 --> 08:17.120
While it exists across the political spectrum, I think it's much stronger on the right.

08:17.120 --> 08:21.360
The ethos of, that's just the way the world is, without ever exploring the thought on

08:21.360 --> 08:23.360
the way the world can be.

08:23.360 --> 08:27.320
And while there is reason to use cynicism, the world is a rough place, and progress doesn't

08:27.320 --> 08:30.920
always work out, there's a difference between acknowledging that reality and becoming a

08:30.920 --> 08:32.420
cynic yourself.

08:32.420 --> 08:35.840
When you can transform people into cynics, that's really advantageous to anyone trying

08:35.840 --> 08:37.900
to maintain the status quo.

08:37.900 --> 08:41.300
So it shouldn't be a surprise that it's the tool most often deployed by people who have

08:41.300 --> 08:43.540
the most to lose if the system were changed.

08:43.540 --> 08:48.140
It's not a coincidence that so much billionaire money funds these fringe right-wing outlets.

08:48.140 --> 08:52.580
From PragerU to The Daily Wire, these media companies can trace their origins to investments

08:52.580 --> 08:56.460
from fracking and oil industries that are looking for a slick outlet that will fight

08:56.460 --> 09:01.480
to ensure regulations are imposed upon industries that make climate change worse and undermine

09:01.480 --> 09:03.580
investment in renewable energy.

09:03.580 --> 09:07.140
This can mean everything from spreading lies about climate change to relentlessly attacking

09:07.140 --> 09:10.880
politicians seeking to implement policies that would reduce carbon emissions.

09:10.880 --> 09:14.480
In other words, they fight to maintain the status quo.

09:14.480 --> 09:18.440
As a side note, I would like to say that this doesn't mean that Dennis Prager or Ben Shapiro

09:18.440 --> 09:20.680
are necessarily frauds doing it for the money.

09:20.680 --> 09:22.040
I suppose it could be true.

09:22.040 --> 09:26.000
The main point is, the reason these guys are funded is because they say the things the

09:26.000 --> 09:30.320
energy billionaires want them to say, whether or not it's genuine or not, misses the whole

09:30.320 --> 09:33.000
point of why they exist in the first place.

09:33.000 --> 09:37.660
The point of channels like these are to confuse political activism as engaging with the channels

09:37.660 --> 09:38.660
themselves.

09:38.660 --> 09:42.580
That is to say, you are achieving some kind of political goal by consuming the content

09:42.580 --> 09:43.580
they produce.

09:43.580 --> 09:47.900
In effect, you are helping to dunk on the libs by watching one of these videos.

09:47.900 --> 09:50.160
You aren't advocating for policy change, of course.

09:50.160 --> 09:52.180
You aren't encouraging political activism.

09:52.180 --> 09:54.060
You're just pointing and laughing at someone.

09:54.060 --> 09:57.220
And the world can use on without any major changes.

09:57.220 --> 09:59.140
Which is the whole point.

09:59.140 --> 10:03.020
That's the sinister nature of these channels, all the while collecting subscriber fees and

10:03.020 --> 10:06.860
advertising dollars along the way, and directing you to vote for the occasional politician

10:06.860 --> 10:10.020
who will help their donors make a few extra billion dollars.

10:10.020 --> 10:13.120
And who wouldn't feel cynical seeing a business model like that laid out?

10:13.120 --> 10:17.020
The truth is a depressing thing sometimes, but I hope that no one watching this would

10:17.020 --> 10:22.280
ever consider giving in to a power imbalance like that on the basis of the idea that this

10:22.280 --> 10:24.720
is how the world works.

10:24.720 --> 10:27.520
Apathy and cynicism are poison to the left.

10:27.520 --> 10:30.520
It discourages activism and encourages disengagement.

10:30.520 --> 10:35.000
It's never expressly endorsed, but as I hope I've demonstrated, is implicit in a lot of

10:35.000 --> 10:36.000
conservative media.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.800
While you might be able to debate someone on facts or reach them through emotion, it's

10:39.800 --> 10:44.720
a lot harder when the very idea of caring about something is made distasteful.

10:44.720 --> 10:49.480
Or the only things people seem to care about are standing in opposition to some perceived

10:49.480 --> 10:50.480
enemy.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.960
Particularly, I hate how the left's compassion and kindness are presented as disingenuous

10:54.960 --> 10:59.080
or manipulative, as if no one could truly believe these things.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.240
It's certainly possible to believe these things if you're willing to actually have some empathy

11:03.240 --> 11:08.320
and concern for the people around you, and sometimes even the people you've never met.

11:08.320 --> 11:14.080
One of the nice things about caring is if you believe in it, and you do it, it's true.

11:14.080 --> 11:18.280
Certainly I've been just as guilty of this as anyone, and I'm not convinced it's necessarily

11:18.280 --> 11:22.680
a bad thing entirely, pointing out how full of crap people are is important, but pointing

11:22.680 --> 11:26.240
out how wrong someone is isn't the same thing as having a political ideology.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.720
It's also something that hurts us more than it hurts the right.

11:29.720 --> 11:34.000
We need to organize and create action to change the world for the better, and they don't.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.560
What do we do, Jose?

11:35.560 --> 11:37.160
Tell us the answers.

11:37.160 --> 11:42.620
If you would like to know a starting point, I would suggest you look as local as possible.

11:42.620 --> 11:45.920
This is where you'll have the strongest impact as an individual.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.960
Think about the issues that matter most to you, and join local organizations that engage

11:49.960 --> 11:56.160
with them, whether it's something like environmentalism, or labor reforms, or social justice issues

11:56.160 --> 11:57.480
more broadly.

11:57.480 --> 12:02.200
Look at public forums like city council meetings, or residence association meetings, anywhere

12:02.200 --> 12:05.480
where people are offered an open forum to discuss the issues that matter to them, and

12:05.480 --> 12:07.880
meet other people who care about the same things.

12:07.880 --> 12:11.240
Even something as simple as attending a protest can make a difference.

12:11.240 --> 12:15.560
Try to think of it as joining a group, a community that can help change the world around

12:15.560 --> 12:16.560
you.

12:16.560 --> 12:19.360
Because when you find more of those people who are like you and want to change things,

12:19.360 --> 12:22.320
you'll realize you actually have a lot of power when you work together.

12:22.320 --> 12:26.360
However you decide to use your political consciousness, I just want you to try to be constructively

12:26.360 --> 12:30.880
engaged, and as terrible as the world is sometimes, you can't afford the luxury of not caring

12:30.880 --> 12:33.640
enough to want to make the world a better place.

12:33.640 --> 12:37.560
Humanity has been slowly improving itself over generations, but it never got better

12:37.560 --> 12:40.960
by not caring.

12:40.960 --> 12:44.280
This is a short video, I know people like the shorter ones, but I try not to make them

12:44.280 --> 12:47.040
unless they have something I actually want to say, and this is something that's been

12:47.040 --> 12:48.800
on the back of my mind for a while.

12:48.800 --> 12:53.020
You can join the lovely people whose names are floating up the screen, those are my patrons

12:53.020 --> 12:57.600
and members, they don't just get their names in the credits, although that's pretty awesome

12:57.600 --> 12:58.600
right?

12:58.600 --> 13:02.520
They also get early access to videos and download things to my theme songs.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.400
It's all super cool.

13:04.400 --> 13:09.440

If you don't know what to comment, why not tell me your favorite song that's a cover

13:16.280 --> 13:17.480
of another song?

13:17.480 --> 13:19.280
Thank you everyone for watching!
