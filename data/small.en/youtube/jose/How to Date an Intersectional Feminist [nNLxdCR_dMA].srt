1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,220
Oh, dating is hard. Really hard. Especially for leftist soy boys like me, who have never

2
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:15,740
really touched a woman. But hey, my pal, Roaming Millennial has posted some great advice

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:21,920
for how to date an intersectional feminist. Not really, of course. This is actually just

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,900
a video of her talking shit about an intersectional feminist. In this case, it's a woman named

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:31,820
Lyra Witt, who wrote an article about questions an intersectional feminist should ask on a

6
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:36,820
first date. Before really getting into those questions, Roaming Millennial gives Lyra Witt's

7
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:46,860
Twitter account a shoutout with this. Wow, that looks bad. Even worse if you decide not

8
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:52,340
to look at the context. Instead, if you spend about one minute looking into it, you'll

9
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:57,220
see that this tweet is actually at the end of a tiny little thread commenting on a story about a

10
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:02,820
mixed race girl growing up in Ireland who was raised by white parents. It's a sad meditation

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:07,460
on the limitations of colorblindness, and how pretending race is irrelevant is something that

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,980
does a disservice to real discrimination. The idea is that living in a cloistered white world can

13
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,100
leave someone of mixed racial background unprepared for a world that will judge them on the basis of

14
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,180
their skin color. Now, I can't read Lyra Witt's mind, but I'm going to go out on a limb and say

15
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,740
that her tweet about killing all the white people was a cheeky swipe at the idea of whiteness as a

16
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:36,060
default identity disregarding the real discrimination people of color face. I managed to decode that

17
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:42,220
tricky bit of subtext by reading the actual text of what she wrote. And if you really want to ignore

18
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:48,780
that context, I'd like to point out that Lyra Witt has a white father and a white husband. Maybe

19
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,020
Roaming Millennial should try doing some basic research when bringing up a tweet in the video.

20
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:58,260
She can start by scrolling up slightly. Let's actually get to the meat of the article and

21
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:05,500
Roaming Millennials rebuttal. Number one, do you believe that black lives matter? Yes, wonderful.

22
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:10,260
Let's start here. There are three categories that are non-negotiables for me, an understanding of

23
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:14,500
race, class, and gender. I don't want to have to have laborious discussions where I have to prove

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,500
to someone that white privilege or not black privilege exists. If they are willing to learn

25
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,540
and listen and make the space to decenter their whiteness, if they're white, that's a good place

26
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,980
to start. People aren't debating whether black lives do in fact matter. People are debating whether

27
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:32,420
systemic racial injustice still exists. Is someone having a different opinion than you on the issue

28
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,540
really that much of a turnout that you need to find out their position right away on the first date

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,700
in order to screen them out? Okay, what Roaming Millennial isn't getting here is that her position

30
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:48,780
and brace herself here is one of privilege. It's easy to be a non-black person and respectfully

31
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,820
disagree with a friendly person who doesn't think that systemic anti-black racial discrimination

32
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:58,860
exists because you literally don't have any skin in the game. If you're an asshole, you might not

33
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,220
even care, I guess. But if you're someone who cares about injustice, systemic discrimination

34
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,700
might bother you. And this may be another shocker, but there are some people out there,

35
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,860
let's just call them intersectional feminists, who are passionate about fighting injustice.

36
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:21,580
And if that passionate person is black and someone who therefore faces that systemic discrimination,

37
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,580
they might not want to date someone who thinks they're delusional. Basically,

38
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,460
this first point is a simple test of empathy and Roaming Millennial failed.

39
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:36,540
Number two, what are your thoughts on gender and sexual orientation? The gender binary is a tiny

40
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,740
box and I wish it didn't exist, but it does. I can't imagine being with someone who is transphobic.

41
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:46,300
As a feminist and woman of color, it would be a betrayal of what I stand for. Okay, this is

42
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,740
something I see all the time and it bothers me. Believing in a gender binary is not the same thing

43
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:59,420
as being transphobic. It kind of is transphobic. Not only does Roaming Millennial betray her

44
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,540
ignorance on the subject, but she also denies the lived experience of people who fall outside the

45
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:10,380
gender binary. Telling someone they're just confused in the face of evidence to the contrary

46
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,980
is a pretty shitty thing to do. Oh, and since I know Roaming Millennial is such a lover of

47
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:20,380
science and learning, I've included a link to my favorite science YouTuber, Concordance,

48
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:27,420
and his video on binary gender. Maybe take 10 minutes out of your life and learn how to

49
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:33,180
uh not be a dick, basically. There's no way straight to say that one, never mind.

50
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,860
Number three, how do you work to dismantle sexism and misogyny in your life? I've met cishet men

51
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:43,740
who hate women. They say they love women, but that love is conditional on not having their

52
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,780
toxic masculinity questioned or threatened in any way. And they love us as a monolith. They love

53
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:53,340
what women have to offer, whether it is sex, food, love care, emotional labor. They love us for what

54
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,140
we can do for them, not because of who we are for ourselves. Wow, don't you hate it when men

55
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:02,700
make their love for women conditional based on a woman's worldview? Gee, isn't it awful when men

56
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:08,540
are only interested in women based on superficial aspects? Self-awareness, zero. I think she's saying

57
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:15,660
a worldview is superficial. I'm actually not sure what she's trying to say because it's hidden

58
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,940
under the weight of this terrible joke. She thinks she's caught the author in a bout of hypocrisy.

59
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:27,420
This is the point she's responding to. Witt is saying that an intersectional feminist

60
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,500
probably wouldn't want to date a guy who subscribes to toxic masculinity.

61
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:38,060
In fact, I'd wager a guest that most women wouldn't want to date a guy who subscribes to

62
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:43,420
toxic masculinity. This seems obvious and sensible to me, and you would think Roman

63
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,900
Millennial would have understood it, having read it out loud just a few moments before her

64
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:54,940
commentary, but no. She thinks having an ideology and criticizing someone else for having a different

65
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:02,220
one is somehow hypocritical. It actually isn't when the two ideologies are polar opposites.

66
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:09,980
You could even say they're conflicting. Also, an ideology is not superficial. It's actually the

67
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:18,860
exact opposite. Jesus Christ. Let's move on. I grew up with Jewish, Israeli, and non-Israeli

68
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:23,180
friends and Palestinian friends. Before even understanding how power and oppression work

69
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,740
together, we understood the trivial hatred that colonized and put in constant danger the lives of

70
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:33,020
Palestinians every single day. Being pro-Palestine is not the same thing as being anti-Semitic. I

71
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,660
shouldn't even have to express that, but being pro-Palestine and BDS is a necessary part of

72
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,060
intersectionality. You know, I get why people like this aren't big fans of Israeli, got the whole

73
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:46,460
colonialism, settler, military power thing going on, but I don't understand why they would choose

74
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:51,260
to identify themselves as being specifically pro-Palestine. Try going to Palestine and talking

75
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:59,820
about all this LGBTQ non-binary gender stuff. Okay, so what do the LGBT policies of Israel or

76
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:04,700
Palestine have to do with what Whit is talking about? Does Roman Millennial think we should ignore

77
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,500
people being oppressed by a colonial power because they aren't down with the LGBT community?

78
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:17,020
Is this her trying to use SJW logic against itself? She doesn't really understand how SJW

79
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,380
or regular logic seem to work in this case. And this is basically just what about-ism run amok,

80
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,340
and it won't be the last time we see this. Number six, what is your understanding of settler

81
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:32,140
colonialism and indigenous rights? I didn't grow up in the United States. I was raised in Switzerland,

82
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:35,980
so my understanding of how Europeans committed genocide against indigenous populations here in

83
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,460
the U.S. was fairly limited. It required a good deal of my own research to really understand how

84
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,100
settler colonialism works and how devastating the eraser and violence against Native Americans is

85
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:50,780
and was. Your date thinks Native Americans are tropes or relics of the past? No thanks. No one

86
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:58,300
thinks that. Just nobody. Okay, okay, this shit. She just kind of says that no one believes in it.

87
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,460
Right after reading a section where the author admits that she was someone who believed in it

88
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,700
until she was educated on the subject. Are you taking in anything you're actually reading here?

89
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,860
If they support the school-to-prison pipeline, then there's a good chance they'll only value you

90
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,180
for your ability to nurture them without any reciprocation. I feel like what she's actually

91
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,740
saying here is that people who support capitalism can't love their partners. Love is just for

92
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:32,300
communists. And what the fuck? Love is just for communists? How did you get that from the idea of

93
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:41,500
someone supporting school-to-prison pipelines not being very nurturing? Wow. Er, wait, wait.

94
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:48,380
Did Roman Millennial just say capitalists support the school-to-prison pipeline?

95
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,020
She just gave the game away. Hit it, boys.

96
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:10,380
Number eight. Can any human be illegal? We live on a tiny planet with land and water within a

97
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,900
galaxy surrounded by a universe with an inconceivable number of other galaxies and planets. Yet here we

98
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:20,620
dictate where we are and who is allowed to be where we are. Don't even know what she was trying

99
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:24,460
to say with that. It seems like there were contradictory statements in those two sentences.

100
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,060
The problem with this line is that it's slightly incongruent and probably could have been worded

101
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:34,380
more effectively had it focused on the vastness of the earth rather than the vastness of the

102
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,580
universe, which we can't really access. That's just me wearing my editor hat, of course. Roman

103
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:43,580
Millennial doesn't make any sort of commentary on that. What she's saying here is that she doesn't

104
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:50,860
understand that the contradiction here is the point. You know, there's lots of space, yet we're

105
00:09:50,860 --> 00:10:00,620
saying where people can and can't be. Do you get it now? No? Okay. But whatever. It's just really

106
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:05,660
weird to me how she can claim that white Americans stole this land, yet that at the same time no one

107
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:10,620
should be allowed to dictate where other people are. You can't be mad at whites being in the U.S.

108
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:17,020
while also saying that all people should be able to come to the U.S. Do you not see the difference

109
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:24,620
between letting people freely travel and migrate around the world and how that's different from

110
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:32,300
colonizing a land and genociding the population? How do you not understand this?

111
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:37,660
Number nine. Do you support Muslim Americans and non-Muslim people from Islamic countries?

112
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,620
I can't think of any other religion which has been vilified and lied about more than Islam in

113
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:47,660
a cultural and systemic way. I am not Muslim, so I will stay in my lane, but I cannot imagine for

114
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,140
a second even claiming to be a feminist if I didn't stand in solidarity with my Muslim friends

115
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:58,540
and family. Guys, we need to make this plane ticket happen. I'm not even meaning right now.

116
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,220
Let's send her to Saudi Arabia, home of the two most holy sites in Islam. Let's do it, guys.

117
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:10,380
So, Roaming Millennial says she's not meme-ing, but I assume she is because she's a liar,

118
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:15,500
or at least disingenuous, or maybe she doesn't know what meme-ing is. She doesn't understand

119
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,900
most of what she's talking about. So, yeah, maybe that's it. Anyway, Saudi Arabia is oppressive.

120
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,740
What does that have to do with oppressing Muslim people in the U.S.? Does Roaming Millennial not

121
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:31,580
think this is happening? Or does she think it's less important than people being oppressed in

122
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:39,500
other countries? What about Islam strikes again? Also, read the title of point nine again.

123
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:44,620
Whit explicitly writes non-Muslim people in Islamic countries needing support too,

124
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:52,780
so she was speaking out against oppression in Saudi Arabia. I don't know. I'm not surprised

125
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:57,980
you missed it. You missed most of this article. We're not really learning anything responding

126
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,980
to her, so here's a fun fact. The term whataboutism was coined as a response to Soviets who refused

127
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:09,980
to talk about their country's misdeeds to focus on American ones. And if Roaming Millennial is using

128
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,900
Soviet tactics, we did it again, boys. We won.

129
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:29,020
Also, I'm not a tanky. Buddhist Stalinism, etc.

130
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:34,620
Number 10. Does your allyship include disabled folks? Be mindful of others who mock disabled

131
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:39,820
people. That kind of cruelty is inexcusable. On a date with someone who uses ableist slurs,

132
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,500
walk away. I don't think you should be cruel to disabled people. Don't think you should

133
00:12:43,500 --> 00:13:08,940
be cruel to anybody, really. But I have the feeling that this person would probably qualify

134
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,580
using the word retarded to describe something that was not literally retarded as ableist,

135
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:19,900
which I don't agree with. Why can't she just agree with wit and move on? Does she really need to

136
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:26,620
make something up just to talk shit? Also, for the record, using that word to describe someone

137
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,540
or something is a shitty thing to do. There's nothing really here to engage with. She's just

138
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,380
like, it's okay to say it, and doesn't explain herself. You know, I'm actually starting to think

139
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,780
that this list existing is a good thing and that all intersexual feminists should follow it

140
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,780
so that people can know who you are and get out of there as quickly as possible.

141
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:52,300
That's a great line for a closer. This list was designed to screen up people exactly like

142
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:59,580
Roman Millennial. Very ironic. Personally, if I was on my first date ever and they brought up

143
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,500
how shitty this Roman Millennial video was, I'd be crushing on her pretty hard.

144
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:11,180
I'm feeling kind of down now. I mean, if I listen to Roman Millennial,

00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:20,780

So I'll wrap this up and I guess I'm gonna be alone forever. Bye!
