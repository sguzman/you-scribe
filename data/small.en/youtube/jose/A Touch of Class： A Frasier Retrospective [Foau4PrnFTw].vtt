00:00.000 --> 00:08.760
Spin-offs almost never work.

00:08.760 --> 00:14.040
They usually miss the magic of their predecessor, run for half a season, and are quickly forgotten,

00:14.040 --> 00:16.760
resigned to the dustbin of TV history.

00:16.760 --> 00:21.240
Frasier was not just an exception, it was one of those rare sitcoms that went from spin-off

00:21.240 --> 00:23.040
to its own full-fledged hit.

00:23.040 --> 00:28.520
A classic of the 90s, Frasier ran for 11 seasons and was a critical darling, with 37 Emmy wins,

00:28.520 --> 00:34.320
which as of 2022 was the third highest ever for a series and the highest for any sitcom.

00:34.320 --> 00:37.040
Frasier was in some ways an unlikely success story.

00:37.040 --> 00:42.200
As big a hit as Cheers was, being a Cheers spin-off wasn't a surefire recipe for success.

00:42.200 --> 00:47.160
The first spin-off attempt, The Tortelles, lasted a mere 13 episodes before it was cancelled.

00:47.160 --> 00:51.280
When Cheers went off the air, a poll conducted by Pew found that, of all the Cheers characters

00:51.280 --> 00:56.200
who might get a spin-off, only 2% of fans wanted to see one starring Frasier.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.280
Not the best of omens, but Frasier quickly went over any doubters by being a hit from

01:00.280 --> 01:01.880
its very first episode.

01:01.880 --> 01:05.960
Of course, the story behind how that show came to be started before that first title

01:05.960 --> 01:06.960
card.

01:06.960 --> 01:11.160
It's hard to explain Frasier without explaining all of Cheers, and luckily I've already done

01:11.160 --> 01:12.160
that.

01:12.160 --> 01:14.360
If you'd like to hear a detailed breakdown of that show, please check out my video on

01:14.360 --> 01:15.360
Cheers.

01:15.360 --> 01:17.040
For everyone else, here's a quick refresher.

01:17.040 --> 01:22.240
Frasier Crane was introduced in season 3 of the series as a foil in the Sam-Diane will-they-won't-they

01:22.240 --> 01:23.240
relationship.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.840
Although the character was intended to make a quick exit, appearing as a temporary boyfriend

01:26.840 --> 01:30.320
for Diane, Kelsey Grammer made such a strong impression on the show's producers that

01:30.320 --> 01:32.420
they kept him around for the next eight seasons.

01:32.420 --> 01:36.520
In that time, he was left at the altar by Diane, met and married, Lilith Sternan, had

01:36.520 --> 01:39.520
a child named Frederick, revealed that he had been married once before in his younger

01:39.520 --> 01:43.800
days, and eventually divorced Lilith, only to seemingly reconcile in the final season

01:43.800 --> 01:44.800
of the show.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.520
At the end of Cheers, Frasier was set to spend the rest of his days sitting in that bar in

01:48.520 --> 01:53.200
Boston, listening to Cliff tell tall tales, watching Norm drink countless beers, and

01:53.200 --> 01:57.240
inhaling dangerous levels of Sam Malone's many layers of cologne.

01:57.240 --> 02:00.280
But a Frasier spin-off took the character in a new direction.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.400
Let's briefly talk about Wings.

02:02.400 --> 02:07.280
The series was created by David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee, all former writers on

02:07.280 --> 02:08.280
Cheers.

02:08.280 --> 02:11.520
It was through their production company, Grub Street Productions, that they approached Kelsey

02:11.520 --> 02:13.700
Grammer about working on a new series.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.960
They had a good relationship from their time on Cheers together, so much so that Frasier

02:16.960 --> 02:26.480
even made a guest appearance on an episode of Wings.

02:26.480 --> 02:30.160
Originally this new project wasn't going to be a Cheers-related spin-off at all, but

02:30.160 --> 02:32.880
rather an original series starring Kelsey Grammer.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.360
The idea they came up with was that of a wealthy mogul who was in a motorcycle accident and

02:37.360 --> 02:41.400
then confined to his bedroom, running his entire empire from his bed.

02:41.400 --> 02:46.080
The idea was rejected by NBC and Paramount, and it was firmly suggested that the new show

02:46.080 --> 02:57.760
would be about Frasier Crane.

02:57.760 --> 03:01.720
If Frasier was going to return, Kelsey Grammer insisted on the rest of the show being something

03:01.720 --> 03:05.640
entirely new, so the character was packed up, moved to Seattle, and would start a new

03:05.640 --> 03:08.000
life as a radio psychiatrist.

03:08.000 --> 03:12.480
Frasier Crane would be played, of course, by Kelsey Grammer, the erudite, sophisticated

03:12.480 --> 03:14.280
band returning to his hometown.

03:14.280 --> 03:17.920
Although he had known Frasier for nine years on Cheers, in Seattle he would be far more

03:17.920 --> 03:22.560
inclined to let his more cultured side show, with less time spent on bar stools and more

03:22.560 --> 03:24.240
time spent in opera boxes.

03:24.240 --> 03:27.320
He would also spend less time being married and more time trying to figure out how to

03:27.320 --> 03:42.680
be a single man in his forties.

03:42.680 --> 03:46.280
David Hyde Pierce was cast as Niles Crane, Frasier's younger brother.

03:46.280 --> 03:49.720
Although the initial idea for the show never included a brother character, he was added

03:49.720 --> 03:54.200
after assistant casting director Sheila Guthrie pointed out how much Pierce resembled a young

03:54.200 --> 03:57.580
Kelsey Grammer, particularly in his first appearance on Cheers.

03:57.580 --> 04:01.600
After the character was created, the role went directly to Pierce, who created exactly

04:01.600 --> 04:22.000
what you would expect of Frasier's brother, prim, eccentric, and dripping with snobbery.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.040
Martin Crane was played by John Mahoney.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.840
The gruff former cop who finds himself suddenly living with Frasier after he becomes unable

04:27.840 --> 04:31.960
to handle life on his own due to a gunshot wound he received a few years prior.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.680
Martin was inspired by the real-life experience of series co-creator David Lee, who had been

04:35.680 --> 04:51.360
helping take care of his in-form father at the time.

04:51.360 --> 04:54.920
Mahoney was the first choice for the character, and much like Pierce, was offered the role

04:54.920 --> 05:02.600
directly.

05:02.600 --> 05:06.280
Jane Leves played Daphne Moon, Martin's physical therapist and live-in housekeeper

05:06.280 --> 05:07.640
for Frasier and Martin.

05:07.640 --> 05:11.420
Although initially there was some discussion on making her Latina, the producers eventually

05:11.420 --> 05:15.800
made Daphne English, and Jane Leves, like Pierce and Mahoney before her, was pre-approved

05:15.800 --> 05:16.800
for the role.

05:16.800 --> 05:20.680
Daphne provides a quirkier side of Frasier's home life, occasionally dropping in strange

05:20.680 --> 05:36.520
stories from her days back in Manchester, and having the odd psychic vision.

05:36.520 --> 05:41.320
Roz Doyle, played by Perry Gilpin, is the hard-edged foil to the more genteel character

05:41.320 --> 05:42.320
of Frasier.

05:42.320 --> 05:46.840
She brings her frank way of speaking to bear in most scenes at the KACL radio station,

05:46.840 --> 05:49.240
along with a very prolific dating life.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.680
The only character whose actor wasn't pre-approved, at first Lisa Kudrow, was cast to be Roz.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.920
Gilpin was brought in when things didn't work out with her, although Kudrow would find

05:56.920 --> 06:12.600
her own success a year later when she was cast as Phoebe in the show Friends.

06:12.600 --> 06:16.860
The final member of the cast was a lovable Jack Russell Terrier named Moose, who played

06:16.860 --> 06:18.840
the role of Eddie, Martin's pet dog.

06:18.840 --> 06:22.440
Moose played Eddie for the first six seasons, but in later seasons, with Moose getting

06:22.440 --> 06:39.440
older, his son Enzo took up the family business and also played Eddie.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.880
Although the principal cast was relatively small, Frasier made the most of them with

06:42.880 --> 06:46.680
numerous episodes exploring the antics of the Korean men and the women who tolerated

06:46.680 --> 06:47.680
them.

06:47.680 --> 06:51.240
There were current characters who joined them, including Dan Butler as Bob Bulldog

06:51.240 --> 06:56.240
Briscoe, Edward Hibbert as Gil Chesterton, and Tom McGowan as Kenny Daly.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.580
Even though Frasier was a spin-off, there was such a strong desire for it to be its

06:59.580 --> 07:04.420
own show that very few cameos came from Cheers regulars, with one exception, Bebe Neworth,

07:04.420 --> 07:08.160
who would reprise her role as Lilith, in every season of Frasier.

07:08.160 --> 07:12.860
Although the show had no theme song, its ending theme, tossed salad and scrambled eggs, sung

07:12.860 --> 07:17.320
by grammar at his insistence, is one of TV's most memorable closers.

07:17.320 --> 07:20.420
According to the series' composer, Bruce Miller, the lyrics weren't allowed to make

07:20.420 --> 07:24.140
any reference to the subject matter of the show, including its title, and there has been

07:24.140 --> 07:26.720
some speculation as to what the song even means.

07:26.720 --> 07:30.200
Although the lyrics seem nonsensical, they actually do tell a story.

07:30.200 --> 07:35.120
Hey baby, I hear the blues a-callin', tossed salad and scrambled eggs, refers to Frasier's

07:35.120 --> 07:36.920
callers on his radio show.

07:36.920 --> 07:37.920
The next part?

07:37.920 --> 07:42.560
But maybe I seem a bit confused, maybe, but I got you pegged, refers to Frasier struggling

07:42.560 --> 07:45.560
to understand his own life, but still being able to help.

07:45.560 --> 07:50.320
But I don't know what to do with these tossed salad and scrambled eggs, the callin' again,

07:50.320 --> 07:59.560
is a reference to an endless stream of people calling for help.

07:59.560 --> 08:05.900
On September 16th, 1993, Frasier debuted and much of America was watching.

08:05.900 --> 08:10.080
The premiere of Frasier was titled The Good Son, and was written by the show's creators,

08:10.080 --> 08:14.320
David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee, and directed by long-standing Cheers director

08:14.320 --> 08:15.320
James Burroughs.

08:15.440 --> 08:18.840
It very quickly filled in the blanks as to what happened with Frasier following the end

08:18.840 --> 08:19.840
of Cheers.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.000
Six months ago, I was living in Boston.

08:23.000 --> 08:31.640
My wife had left me, which was very painful, then she came back to me, which was excruciating.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.080
Reflecting on this moment, writer David Isaacs said,

08:34.080 --> 08:35.680
That got a big laugh.

08:35.680 --> 08:36.680
Bigger than it should have.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.760
I thought to myself, we're going to be okay.

08:39.760 --> 08:44.280
Part of the premise is given to us right away, with Frasier hosting a radio show in Seattle,

08:44.280 --> 08:47.440
and we are introduced to his brother Niles in a creative way.

08:47.440 --> 08:51.000
Frasier made use of title cards to introduce scenes, so instead of having an awkward bit

08:51.000 --> 08:55.000
of dialogue where the relationship between Frasier and Niles is acknowledged explicitly,

08:55.000 --> 08:56.680
the title card simply reads,

08:56.680 --> 08:57.680
The Brother.

08:57.680 --> 09:02.220
These title cards became an iconic part of the Frasier style, often framing your expectations

09:02.220 --> 09:06.400
for a scene with some important information, or providing a joke to add a bit more levity

09:06.400 --> 09:07.400
into the scene.

09:07.400 --> 09:11.720
In the cafe, Niles helpfully introduces the idea that Martin should move in with Frasier.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.080
All right, I'll make up the spare bedroom.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.080
Oh, you're a good son, Frasier.

09:16.080 --> 09:19.080
Oh god, I am, aren't I?

09:19.080 --> 09:21.080
Two cafe supremos?

09:21.080 --> 09:22.080
Anything to eat?

09:22.080 --> 09:24.680
No, I seem to have lost my appetite.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.200
I'll have a large piece of cheesecake.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.800
Martin is not thrilled with the arrangement.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.120
We all know I am here.

09:31.120 --> 09:34.400
Your old man can't be left alone for ten minutes without falling on his ass and Frasier got

09:34.400 --> 09:35.400
stuck with me.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.400
Isn't that right?

09:36.400 --> 09:37.400
No, no!

09:37.400 --> 09:38.400
No!

09:38.400 --> 09:39.400
No!

09:40.400 --> 09:41.400
I want you here.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.800
They'll give us a chance to get reacquainted.

09:43.800 --> 09:47.800
That implies we were acquainted at one point.

09:50.400 --> 09:54.200
Martin brings one piece of furniture with him to complete Frasier's carefully decorated

09:54.200 --> 09:56.920
apartment, his iconic chair.

09:56.920 --> 10:01.320
After a suggestion from Niles, Frasier decides to hire some help, and we then meet Daphne.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.320
You were a policeman, weren't you?

10:03.320 --> 10:04.960
Yeah, how'd you know?

10:04.960 --> 10:08.960
I must confess, I'm a bit psychic.

10:10.280 --> 10:14.440
Martin instantly wants to hire her, partially, by suspect, to annoy Frasier.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.600
The main conflict of this episode is between Frasier and Martin struggling to find a way

10:17.600 --> 10:18.600
to live together.

10:18.600 --> 10:22.240
Ever since you moved in here, it's been a snide comment about this, or a smart little

10:22.240 --> 10:23.240
put-down about that.

10:23.240 --> 10:28.720
Well, I've done my best to make a home here for you, and once, just once would have killed

10:28.720 --> 10:30.800
you to say thank you!

10:30.800 --> 10:32.880
One lousy thank you!

10:32.880 --> 10:36.200
After the fight, Martin makes a gesture to Frasier the best way he can.

10:36.200 --> 10:42.120
Yeah, I'm worried my son doesn't know that I really appreciate what he's done for me.

10:42.120 --> 10:43.120
Why don't you tell him?

10:43.120 --> 10:48.200
You know how it is with fathers and sons, you have trouble saying that stuff.

10:48.200 --> 10:55.200
Well, if it helps, I suspect your son already knows how you feel.

10:58.200 --> 10:59.200
Is that all?

10:59.200 --> 11:00.200
Yeah, I guess that's it.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.200
Thank you, Dr. Crane.

11:02.200 --> 11:03.200
My pleasure, Martin.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.200
Yeah, what I said, I said thank you!

11:06.200 --> 11:07.200
Yes, I heard.

11:08.200 --> 11:12.200
What makes this a great pilot is that it not only establishes the premise and interests

11:12.200 --> 11:16.200
of the characters, but also sets up one of the primary plotlines for the first few seasons,

11:16.200 --> 11:20.200
Frasier and Martin reconnecting after Frasier had spent 15 years away in Boston.

11:20.200 --> 11:24.200
One thing abundantly clear is that this show will be set in the world of the upper class.

11:24.200 --> 11:29.200
Frasier is obviously well off, and so is Niles, and while Martin and Daphne certainly aren't,

11:29.200 --> 11:33.400
both of them will be living under Frasier's roof, reacting to the context he's created

11:33.400 --> 11:38.600
for them, and Roz, while more akin to Daphne and Martin in class status, typically appears

11:38.600 --> 11:43.480
in scenes at the radio station, the cafe, or Frasier's apartment in a supporting role.

11:43.480 --> 11:46.800
When you look at the class backgrounds of the characters, this split between them matters

11:46.800 --> 11:49.400
far less than the context they find themselves in.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.400
Ultimately, this show is about Frasier's world.

11:52.400 --> 11:56.400
Niles might be the best fit into it, but to an extent, all the other characters are trying

11:56.400 --> 11:58.240
to fit into Frasier's world as well.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.960
And this is all very ironic considering this whole episode is about Frasier fighting himself

12:01.960 --> 12:03.160
in a new context.

12:03.160 --> 12:07.240
It speaks to the power of perspective and how when a show focuses on one character,

12:07.240 --> 12:11.160
it can very easily shape the world around them, and how they define this space.

12:17.160 --> 12:21.720
Living in an apartment that is almost timelessly classic in its design, working the cushy job

12:21.720 --> 12:26.480
of radio psychiatrists and going to chic restaurants and art events, Frasier Crane is a man of

12:26.480 --> 12:28.040
means and class.

12:28.040 --> 12:32.440
He's also incredibly vain, arrogant, and sometimes a complete goof.

12:32.440 --> 12:35.600
But none of these qualities make him particularly likeable.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.960
The key to Frasier's appeal is that he very deeply cares about people.

12:38.960 --> 12:43.800
Frasier's job as a radiotherapist makes him something of a local celebrity in Seattle,

12:43.800 --> 12:46.240
more so than you'd expect from someone on the radio.

12:46.240 --> 12:49.400
And Frasier is more than happy to revel in that fame and fortune.

12:49.400 --> 12:55.120
Then I will just tell them that they can take their five-figure deal and find someone else.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.120
Five figures.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.680
Didn't I mention pressures?

12:57.680 --> 13:00.280
This is for television, the big kahuna.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.280
Television.

13:01.280 --> 13:05.760
The research has shown that a single television commercial can turn an obscure radio personality

13:05.760 --> 13:08.600
into a national celebrity.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.800
A year from now, someone like you could be broadcasting your message of hope and healing

13:13.800 --> 13:21.840
not just to the Pacific Northwest, but to the entire nation.

13:21.840 --> 13:26.560
That celebrity affords Frasier access to Seattle's more elite circles, often hobbing with the

13:26.560 --> 13:28.360
most impressive of knobs.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.720
What makes Frasier fun to watch is when that class status makes him the subject of mockery.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.120
For example, when Bulldog tricks them into singing some Gilbert and Sullivan.

13:36.120 --> 13:40.120
I don't suppose you happen to remember the words to Three Little Maids?

13:40.120 --> 13:42.120
Well, let me see.

13:42.120 --> 13:46.120
Three little maids from school are we?

13:46.120 --> 13:49.120
Where does the school go where they may be?

13:49.120 --> 13:52.120
Filled with the brim with girlish glee.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.120
And the maids from school.

13:55.280 --> 13:59.360
It's the classic comedy trope of laughing at someone in a higher class be humiliated.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.960
And while it's easy to laugh at Frasier's class making him look silly, it does make

14:02.960 --> 14:07.080
it tougher to empathize with him when it also isolates him from suffering.

14:07.080 --> 14:10.880
In The Crucible, Frasier is the victim of fraud when a painting he's purchased is

14:10.880 --> 14:11.880
revealed to be a forgery.

14:11.880 --> 14:12.880
I didn't paint it.

14:12.880 --> 14:20.880
Of course you didn't, you created it, you gave birth to it.

14:20.880 --> 14:24.880
I didn't do anything to it.

14:25.120 --> 14:29.120
I never saw this painting before in my whole life.

14:29.120 --> 14:33.840
And you thought I was going to embarrass you?

14:33.840 --> 14:37.760
The cops are unable to help Frasier, and a legal proceeding against the gallery he bought

14:37.760 --> 14:41.080
the painting from would cost more than the painting is worth, leaving him with nothing

14:41.080 --> 14:43.720
to do but hurl a brick through the gallery's window.

14:43.720 --> 14:46.720
If you act like a barbarian, you will become a barbarian.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.720
Give him the brick, Frasier.

14:49.720 --> 14:50.720
And let him get away with this!

14:50.720 --> 14:51.720
I know, I know.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.720
What the gallery owner did to you was wrong.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.160
It was humiliating.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.360
But if you throw that brick through that window, you will have lost something more valuable

14:59.360 --> 15:00.360
than your money.

15:00.360 --> 15:04.360
You will have lost your mind.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.080
Frasier, you can't do this!

15:07.080 --> 15:11.720
Injustice for Frasier is a blow to his ego, but not the material conditions of his life.

15:11.720 --> 15:17.360
Niles' advice is good only insofar that Frasier can afford to take a little humiliation.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.280
What if this was someone who has swindled out of their savings, or even their weekly

15:20.280 --> 15:21.280
paycheck?

15:21.280 --> 15:24.720
The reason here is that the privileged can afford for the system to fail them.

15:24.720 --> 15:29.100
At the end of the show's fifth season, Frasier's stand against KACL's station manager gets

15:29.100 --> 15:31.360
him and all of his colleagues fired.

15:31.360 --> 15:34.840
And we see Frasier in Season 6 out of work for the first nine episodes.

15:34.840 --> 15:35.840
Frasier?

15:35.840 --> 15:41.840
You're not famous anymore.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.960
Kelsey Grammer spoke about these episodes with Frasier being out of work.

15:44.960 --> 15:46.400
We thought it was a good storyline.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.820
We got nine stories out of it.

15:47.820 --> 15:50.200
We thought it was an interesting journey for him to take.

15:50.200 --> 15:53.920
We always knew he was going to go back to the station, but I think it might have made

15:53.920 --> 15:57.640
the audience uncomfortable because Frasier wasn't as attractive.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.800
There was something more sad about him.

15:59.800 --> 16:03.460
Frasier's suffering is a huge part of what makes the show work, but that's often seen

16:03.460 --> 16:08.040
through his many failures in dating or struggling to hold a dinner party, being out of work

16:08.040 --> 16:09.040
hit differently.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.800
It's easy enough to empathize with a Frasier struggling to find someone.

16:12.800 --> 16:14.000
Dating is universal.

16:14.000 --> 16:17.760
And when his fancy dinner parties go awry, it's usually just his own vanity biting him

16:17.760 --> 16:18.760
in the butt.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.000
This pain wasn't as easy to laugh at.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.880
It was understandable without being relatable, because even out of work, Frasier wasn't hurting

16:25.880 --> 16:26.880
for money.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.040
He was upset that he wasn't famous anymore.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.960
It's possible to pity Frasier, but it's a lot harder to empathize.

16:32.960 --> 16:36.480
And empathy is at the heart of what makes Frasier a great character.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.200
We can see Frasier's personal empathy in his chosen profession as a psychiatrist.

16:40.200 --> 16:44.100
Frasier's background in psychiatry means he's a medical doctor who has chosen to specialize

16:44.100 --> 16:45.260
in mental health.

16:45.260 --> 16:49.540
Although being a character created in 1984, he represents a very old-fashioned depiction

16:49.540 --> 16:53.940
of a psychiatrist, one who fits the classic mold of having a patient sit on a couch while

16:53.940 --> 16:57.700
they talk through their problems, as their psychiatrist takes notes and offers a few

16:57.700 --> 16:58.700
insights.

16:58.700 --> 17:02.620
Something you're more likely to see a psychologist do today rather than a psychiatrist.

17:02.620 --> 17:05.140
Frasier practices his psychiatry through his radio show.

17:05.140 --> 17:06.140
Hello, Mark.

17:06.140 --> 17:07.140
I'm listening.

17:07.140 --> 17:08.140
Okay.

17:08.140 --> 17:13.700
Uh, well, I work at this all-night mini-mart, and, um, I've been watching myself on the

17:13.700 --> 17:19.500
video camera, and the camera me is doing things I don't approve of.

17:19.500 --> 17:22.940
These calls are often voiced by some pretty popular actors, including Mel Brooks, Ben

17:22.940 --> 17:26.980
Steller, Elijah Wood, Mary Tyler Moore, and Kevin Bacon.

17:26.980 --> 17:31.100
Frasier is a Freudian, which dates them even further back to the practice of psychoanalysis.

17:31.100 --> 17:35.700
And psychoanalysis, as is sometimes mentioned on the show, doesn't have the best track

17:35.700 --> 17:36.700
record.

17:36.700 --> 17:40.780
In the episode, Chess Pains, after losing several games of chess against his father,

17:40.780 --> 17:42.260
Frasier is obsessed with winning.

17:42.260 --> 17:47.020
I am analyzing my options, unlike your winged abroach, I like to plan a strategy, like a

17:47.020 --> 17:54.260
general leading his troops into battle.

17:54.260 --> 17:56.420
Jack made Schwarzkopf.

17:56.420 --> 18:02.260
Frasier, who fancies himself an intellectual force, can accept that his less-educated father,

18:02.260 --> 18:05.020
who had never played chess before, is better than him.

18:05.020 --> 18:07.820
So Frasier and Niles analyze why this is happening.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.860
Sooner or later, the son eclipses the father, it's the natural order.

18:10.860 --> 18:14.580
Yet, it's frequently a stumbling block, because the son's competitive stirrings

18:14.580 --> 18:17.580
are accompanied by tremendous feelings of guilt.

18:17.580 --> 18:18.580
I see.

18:18.580 --> 18:21.460
Yes, it's the classic edible conflict.

18:21.460 --> 18:22.460
My God.

18:22.460 --> 18:25.740
And it seems so obvious now, I've been letting him win.

18:25.740 --> 18:28.700
Later, Martin cuts the heart of what's really happening.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.180
This isn't about losing, is it?

18:30.180 --> 18:32.460
This is about losing to me.

18:32.460 --> 18:34.460
That's what's driving you nuts.

18:34.460 --> 18:35.660
How could I lose to the old man?

18:35.660 --> 18:37.020
I'm much smarter than he is.

18:37.020 --> 18:38.020
I never said that.

18:38.020 --> 18:39.500
No, you didn't have to say you've thought it all your life.

18:39.500 --> 18:40.500
No, I haven't.

18:40.500 --> 18:42.500
No, you're insulting my intelligence again.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.420
The answer is painfully obvious.

18:44.420 --> 18:46.660
Martin is just better at chess than Frasier.

18:46.660 --> 18:51.220
In fact, there's an episode of Cheers where Frasier loses a game of chess to the slow-witted

18:51.220 --> 18:54.980
Woody, raising serious questions about Frasier's chess skills.

18:54.980 --> 18:58.260
Rather than accept that, maybe he needs to improve his chess game, Frasier and Niles

18:58.260 --> 19:01.460
concoct this Freudian explanation as to why Frasier keeps losing.

19:01.460 --> 19:04.980
It isn't a genuine attempt to understand the situation, but rather to protect Frasier's

19:04.980 --> 19:09.940
ego on the presumption that an educated man like him must be better at chess than Martin.

19:09.940 --> 19:13.380
Even when Frasier finally wins, he has to make a subtle nod to his little pet theory

19:13.380 --> 19:15.940
about this being some kind of Oedipal struggle.

19:15.940 --> 19:19.940
I'm sorry I beat your dad.

19:19.940 --> 19:23.820
This once again highlights how Frasier is at its funniest when it's highlighting the

19:23.820 --> 19:25.940
excesses of the character.

19:25.940 --> 19:30.740
The series often includes skepticism towards psychiatry and psychology more broadly, or

19:30.740 --> 19:32.980
at least the type practiced by Frasier and Niles.

19:32.980 --> 19:38.180
I'm not like a psychiatrist who works with someone for years and years and it doesn't

19:38.180 --> 19:42.580
matter if they ever get better.

19:42.580 --> 19:44.300
A bust of Freud.

19:44.300 --> 19:47.500
Oh, well, that's really quite thoughtful of you.

19:47.500 --> 19:56.340
I figured you'd appreciate the irony, since he's been proven wrong about practically everything.

19:56.340 --> 20:00.060
I like to think that Freud's theories will stand the test of time.

20:00.060 --> 20:01.060
Really?

20:01.060 --> 20:03.060
Have you read either of his books?

20:03.060 --> 20:04.820
Oh, what a relief.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.540
I've been wringing my hands over nothing.

20:06.540 --> 20:07.540
I mean, it's okay.

20:07.540 --> 20:12.180
All I want to do is have sex with my dead mother.

20:12.180 --> 20:15.540
That last clip is Frasier sighing in relief because he's figured out the meaning of

20:15.540 --> 20:19.260
a particularly difficult dream he's been having where he finds himself in bed with

20:19.260 --> 20:21.540
his colleague, Gil.

20:21.540 --> 20:26.260
Well, look who's up.

20:26.260 --> 20:31.020
Although dreams being secret desires people have isn't backed by much scientific evidence,

20:31.020 --> 20:35.180
if you're someone who buys into dream analysis, the obvious reading here is that Frasier is

20:35.180 --> 20:44.900
secretly gay, an interpretation he resists.

20:44.900 --> 20:48.740
So he and Niles dive deep into their knowledge of dream analysis to pull together all sorts

20:48.740 --> 20:53.340
of conclusions that will, supposedly, resolve the tension in Frasier's mind, letting him

20:53.340 --> 21:02.020
avoid these dreams.

21:02.020 --> 21:05.120
Once again, this analysis is very forced.

21:05.120 --> 21:08.760
The tools of Freudian psychoanalysis are less a tool for greater understanding and

21:08.760 --> 21:11.280
used instead to reassure Frasier's ego.

21:11.280 --> 21:15.540
In the decades since his ideas were introduced, much of the work of Sigmund Freud has largely

21:15.540 --> 21:16.540
been supplanted.

21:16.540 --> 21:20.020
The best explanation I've heard as to why he should still be taught in an academic setting

21:20.020 --> 21:24.760
is that his insights were incredibly important, even though his conclusions were ridiculous.

21:24.760 --> 21:28.880
For example, his insight that human development is a product of not nature or nurture, but

21:28.880 --> 21:32.580
rather nature interacting with nurture, was groundbreaking.

21:32.580 --> 21:36.860
But his conclusion, that development was the guiding of sexual desire through distinct

21:36.860 --> 21:42.300
stages from infancy to adolescence, leading to some kind of oral fixation, is completely

21:42.300 --> 21:44.340
without empirical support.

21:44.340 --> 21:48.100
While it might seem like I'm being a bit unfair to an older show, none of what I'm

21:48.100 --> 21:49.860
saying is particularly new.

21:49.860 --> 21:52.980
Freud's theories have been criticized for decades, and much of this was known in the

21:52.980 --> 21:53.980
90s.

21:53.980 --> 21:58.540
Frasier represents the classic idea of a psychiatrist in the world of pop culture, not reality.

21:58.540 --> 22:02.160
The type of psychoanalysis done by Frasier is sometimes not much better than what Daphne

22:02.160 --> 22:18.000
can figure out on her own.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.520
By the end of this episode, Frasier realizes he's feeling frustrated at work because

22:21.520 --> 22:25.440
he finds a lack of challenge in the colors he's getting, and according to him and Niles,

22:25.440 --> 22:27.080
that should resolve the dream.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.000
Except the episode ends like this.

22:29.000 --> 22:52.520
And just to be clear, I'm not saying therapy is a bad thing.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.680
In fact, working with a psychiatrist or psychologist can be incredibly helpful in improving one's

22:56.680 --> 22:57.680
mental health.

22:57.680 --> 23:01.960
What I am saying is that Frasier and Niles often let their biases impact their psychiatry,

23:01.960 --> 23:05.800
particularly when they try to understand themselves, and that some of the theories and ideas that

23:05.800 --> 23:09.120
they use are very out of date, even for the 90s.

23:09.120 --> 23:12.480
There is another problem with the type of psychiatry practiced by Frasier and Niles

23:12.480 --> 23:13.480
too.

23:13.480 --> 23:15.320
Generally speaking, it is very expensive.

23:15.320 --> 23:18.800
While Frasier doesn't charge his colors anything, his background and expertise come

23:18.800 --> 23:21.800
from a field of medicine that is very lucrative.

23:21.800 --> 23:25.520
Psychoanalytic therapy can involve multiple sessions a week, sometimes lasting for years,

23:25.520 --> 23:29.440
and at a cost of one to two hundred dollars a session in today's money, this type of therapy

23:29.440 --> 23:31.320
can be very costly.

23:31.320 --> 23:34.820
Another way in which this series demonstrates the barriers class places between acts of

23:34.820 --> 23:36.160
compassion.

23:36.160 --> 23:39.200
Although Frasier has chosen a field that puts his help out of the reach of all but the most

23:39.200 --> 23:43.600
privileged, one overarching aspect of his character, and one that makes him particularly likable,

23:43.600 --> 23:45.820
is that he genuinely wants to help other people.

23:45.820 --> 23:49.040
This can be seen in him choosing to host a show where people can call in with their problems

23:49.040 --> 23:51.900
for free, as limited to help as that may be.

23:51.900 --> 23:56.100
One specific example of Frasier's compassion overcoming his vanity is in the episode Death

23:56.100 --> 23:57.100
Becomes Him.

23:57.100 --> 24:01.420
When Martin's physician suddenly passes away, a man who was similar in physique, behavior

24:01.420 --> 24:13.020
and temperament to Frasier, it leads him to question his own mortality.

24:13.020 --> 24:16.540
Frasier becomes obsessed, planning his own funeral and trying to find a way in which

24:16.540 --> 24:18.340
this doctor neglected his health.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.660
He even crashes the man's shiva to learn more about him.

24:20.660 --> 24:41.860
He only steps out of his vanity when the opportunity to help someone arises.

24:41.860 --> 24:45.740
Frasier's insight comes from his own experiences, and he uses these moments of compassion for

24:45.740 --> 24:48.340
others as opportunities to grow himself.

24:48.340 --> 24:53.420
Which isn't the safest way to practice psychiatry, but on a more human, emotional level, it offers

24:53.420 --> 24:55.780
the chance for two people to help one another.

24:55.780 --> 24:59.780
In the episode Dark Victory, a disastrous birthday party for Martin leaves everyone

24:59.780 --> 25:11.660
bickering.

25:11.660 --> 25:14.900
With a blackout keeping them all indoors, Frasier makes the rounds with everyone in

25:14.900 --> 25:39.140
his little extended family offer an advice to calm their various tensions.

25:39.140 --> 25:42.180
It just makes me feel like I'm not very ambitious.

25:42.180 --> 25:46.220
I mean, I could be working in a hospital or a clinic.

25:46.220 --> 25:50.380
Of course you could, Daphne, but maybe that's not what's important to you right now.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.340
I think you'd like being part of a family.

25:52.340 --> 25:58.780
If you can't walk around Paris, you could sit at a nice cafe and let Paris walk past

25:58.780 --> 25:59.780
you.

25:59.780 --> 26:03.940
Maybe buy a glass of wine for a beautiful mademoiselle.

26:03.940 --> 26:06.020
Get yourself a nice bottle of imported beer.

26:06.020 --> 26:08.380
I only like Valentines.

26:08.380 --> 26:10.900
In Paris, Valentines is imported beer.

26:10.900 --> 26:16.740
Could it be that you're really upset just because you couldn't help that woman?

26:16.740 --> 26:18.580
You know I really hate that.

26:18.580 --> 26:22.540
When you take a simple criticism and you turn it back on me, well, I think I'm right.

26:22.540 --> 26:25.180
Well, of course you're right while you think I hate it.

26:25.180 --> 26:28.540
And at the end of it all, Frasier is left emotionally spent.

26:28.540 --> 26:34.860
I tend to each one of you, and you all feel better, and the minute you get a whiff of mesquite

26:34.860 --> 26:42.380
coming from down below, you are out the door, without so much as a thank you.

26:42.380 --> 26:48.860
Well, thank you for the invitation, but I am frankly fed up with people and their problems.

26:48.860 --> 26:50.300
The doctor is out.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.300
Oh, great.

26:51.300 --> 26:52.300
You didn't feel that way.

26:52.300 --> 26:53.300
I am.

26:53.300 --> 26:54.300
Okay, apologies, except-

26:54.300 --> 26:55.300
Oh, great.

26:55.300 --> 26:57.300
You'll come.

26:57.300 --> 27:00.940
Frasier is a helper, from the colors on his show to his own family, and more than that,

27:00.940 --> 27:03.620
he's willing to sacrifice his own downtime to help others.

27:03.620 --> 27:07.780
Albeit while venting his frustrations at the situation, which is totally fair when

27:07.780 --> 27:11.100
you consider his job is to help people, and having to do the same for the people in his

27:11.100 --> 27:13.760
personal life might feel incredibly taxing.

27:13.760 --> 27:16.340
But that gets to the heart of why he's a likable character.

27:16.340 --> 27:18.660
He's willing to put others before himself.

27:18.660 --> 27:22.460
One particularly clever part of this episode is that it takes place during a blackout,

27:22.460 --> 27:26.500
which makes the fancy trappings around them disappear, leaving the characters with only

27:26.500 --> 27:28.300
the props of their own baggage.

27:28.300 --> 27:32.020
With all that gone, Frasier can navigate through the void, using only his compassion to connect

27:32.020 --> 27:33.300
with his loved ones.

27:33.300 --> 27:34.740
And it works very well.

27:34.740 --> 27:38.100
Problems are solved, rifts are mended, and everyone is brought a few steps closer to

27:38.100 --> 27:39.100
each other.

27:39.100 --> 27:43.660
In the episode, The Thousandth Show, Seattle hosts a Frasier Crane Day episode, speaking

27:43.660 --> 27:45.340
directly to Frasier's vanity.

27:45.340 --> 27:54.260
For your sake and the stations to submit to a small, tasteful, low-key public rally.

27:54.260 --> 27:57.860
A series of mishaps keep Frasier from the rally, and he's left to dwell on his own

27:57.860 --> 27:58.860
sense of self.

27:58.860 --> 28:02.140
I wanted my day.

28:02.140 --> 28:08.300
I wanted hoopla and fuss, practically playing the whole thing myself.

28:08.300 --> 28:12.900
When Frasier eventually gets to the rally via a limo ride, or rather, almost there,

28:12.900 --> 28:16.140
he postpones attending because he's met someone who needs help.

28:16.140 --> 28:25.340
Don't worry about me, I've got plenty of time, tell me more about your kids, alright?

28:25.340 --> 28:29.100
I'm John, by the way, I'm Frasier.

28:29.100 --> 28:32.900
The crumpled sign reflects how hollow the fame and fortune are compared to the act of

28:32.900 --> 28:33.900
compassion.

28:33.900 --> 28:37.380
Much like the blackout hiding Frasier's wealth, this obscuring of Frasier's fame

28:37.380 --> 28:41.220
reveal that the true value of his character comes from how he helps people.

28:41.220 --> 28:45.620
Frasier's wealth and radio show, fueled by his occasionally dubious psychiatry, create

28:45.620 --> 28:48.540
a distance between him and the people he wants to help.

28:48.540 --> 28:52.900
In the episode, Frasier's Edge, this becomes particularly evident.

28:52.900 --> 28:56.340
After being told he'll be winning a Lifetime Achievement Award, Frasier has a crisis of

28:56.340 --> 29:13.460
confidence and goes to see his old mentor, Dr. William Tewksbury, played by René Obejongwa.

29:13.460 --> 29:17.860
Dr. Tewksbury reveals to Frasier that he has a tendency to keep people at a distance.

29:17.860 --> 29:18.860
How's your practice?

29:18.860 --> 29:22.340
I don't have a practice, I have a radio show.

29:22.340 --> 29:23.580
Distance?

29:23.580 --> 29:24.580
Any children?

29:24.580 --> 29:27.780
Yes, I have a wonderful son with whom I'm very close.

29:27.780 --> 29:28.780
You live with him?

29:28.780 --> 29:30.900
He lives in Boston.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.900
Distance?

29:32.900 --> 29:33.900
With your wife?

29:33.900 --> 29:34.900
My ex-wife.

29:34.900 --> 29:35.900
Yes, I know.

29:35.900 --> 29:36.900
Distance.

29:36.900 --> 29:37.900
Wasn't she a psychiatrist?

29:37.900 --> 29:38.900
Yes, she was.

29:38.900 --> 29:39.900
She happened to be a damn good one, too.

29:39.900 --> 29:44.020
Well, that's a handy choice for someone who'd rather share ideas than emotions.

29:44.020 --> 29:47.660
Have you ever met Lilith?

29:47.660 --> 29:49.060
No.

29:49.860 --> 29:55.420
Well, she happens to be a very warm and loving woman.

29:55.420 --> 29:59.220
Although psychoanalysis isn't always the best tool for providing therapy to someone,

29:59.220 --> 30:03.020
it does make for a handy way of dissecting art, particularly art that holds it in high

30:03.020 --> 30:04.020
regard.

30:04.020 --> 30:07.780
This episode demonstrates the distance Frasier has created in his life, but it goes beyond

30:07.780 --> 30:10.900
the personal relationships and professional choices he's made.

30:10.900 --> 30:13.220
It goes deep into who he is as a character.

30:13.220 --> 30:16.720
He lives in a social class that creates distance from the rest of the world.

30:16.720 --> 30:20.040
He works in a profession only available to those with the means to pay for it.

30:20.040 --> 30:23.400
And when he takes a step towards bringing his expertise to the people, it's done in

30:23.400 --> 30:26.520
a way that keeps those people at a distance as well.

30:26.520 --> 30:31.200
And somehow through all those distances, manages to make real connections and give people genuine

30:31.200 --> 30:32.200
comfort.

30:32.200 --> 30:36.560
Class, through the mediums of wealth and exclusive medical treatment, reveals itself to be a

30:36.560 --> 30:39.360
barrier to expressions of human compassion.

30:39.360 --> 30:43.800
Frasier is a likeable character, not because he uses his status to help others, but because

30:43.800 --> 30:45.680
he can help others in spite of it.

30:46.720 --> 30:56.200
Frasier simply wouldn't exist without Cheers, so it made perfect sense for some of those

30:56.200 --> 30:59.680
old friends from Cheers to stop by for a few cameos throughout the years.

30:59.680 --> 31:03.760
Frasier had been moved to Seattle, in part, to signify that this new show would be a departure

31:03.760 --> 31:07.320
from Cheers, and the first season of Frasier deliberately avoided bringing back any other

31:07.320 --> 31:08.640
Cheers alumni.

31:08.640 --> 31:11.720
The one exception, naturally, was his ex-wife Lilith.

31:11.720 --> 31:15.440
And the episode featuring her return, titled The Show Where Lilith Comes Back, was the

31:15.440 --> 31:23.040
second most watched episode of Frasier ever.

31:23.040 --> 31:41.400
Luckily for us, Frasier and Lilith still have that wonderful chemistry.

31:41.400 --> 31:45.360
Lilith would make guest appearances in each of the show's 11 seasons, including a particularly

31:45.360 --> 31:55.880
memorable episode where she hooks up with Niles.

31:55.880 --> 32:00.680
Frasier's son Frederick, first played by Luke Tarsetano and then Trevor Einhorn, also

32:00.680 --> 32:26.760
made several appearances, memorably offering some competition to Niles.

32:26.760 --> 32:29.920
By the end of the series, we see how Frasier and Lilith have grown to have a meaningful

32:29.920 --> 32:40.200
friendship together, and Frasier, in spite of Frederick entering his goth phase in the

32:40.200 --> 33:06.920
final season, still manages to have a connection with his son.

33:06.920 --> 33:10.200
Frasier, in spite of the challenges of living on the other side of the country, manages

33:10.200 --> 33:13.440
to hold onto the things that matter most to him from his time in Boston.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.480
It's a charmingly uplifting message.

33:15.480 --> 33:19.400
Of course, there were some other connections from Boston who also had cameos.

33:19.400 --> 33:23.600
In the season two episode, The Show Where Sam Shows Up, Sam Malone, naturally played

33:23.600 --> 33:26.520
by Ted Denson, makes a surprise appearance in Seattle.

33:26.520 --> 33:30.200
This episode also provides some interesting bits of trivia, such as highlighting how much

33:30.200 --> 33:47.880
David Hyde Pierce looked like a young Kelsey Grammer when he first appeared on Cheers.

33:47.880 --> 34:16.320
We also get some plot holes addressed, such as the truth behind Frasier's father.

34:16.320 --> 34:25.320
In the episode, The Show Where Diane Comes Back, we get a cameo from Shelly Long, reprising

34:25.320 --> 34:27.820
her role as Diane, Frasier's horror fiancé.

34:27.820 --> 34:32.160
There was a very brief Diane cameo in season two, but it was this season three episode

34:32.160 --> 34:36.520
that really brought her back for a proper Cheers reunion, complete with a stage production.

34:36.520 --> 35:00.760
The episode offers Frasier the chance to get some real closure with Diane after over

35:00.760 --> 35:20.080
a decade of bitterness.

35:20.080 --> 35:24.440
In season six, Woody Harrelson once again took up the role of Woody Boyd in an episode

35:24.440 --> 35:28.280
you'll be shocked to learn was called The Show Where Woody Shows Up.

35:28.280 --> 35:32.280
This episode really seemed to tie a bow on the idea that Frasier was no longer a spin-off

35:32.280 --> 35:34.440
and had cemented its own identity.

35:58.280 --> 36:19.360
The last of the Cheers reunions is also the

36:19.360 --> 36:22.420
only one with an original name, Cheerful Goodbyes.

36:22.420 --> 36:26.480
This brought back Cliff Clavin, played by John Ratzenberger, Norm Peterson, played by

36:26.480 --> 36:31.600
George Wendt, and Carla Maria, Victoria Angelina, Teresa Apollonia, Lu Ponce, Tartale Lebec,

36:31.600 --> 36:33.000
played by Rhea Perlman.

36:33.000 --> 36:37.240
Of the Cheers reunions, this one is the most extensive and feels the least natural.

36:37.240 --> 36:40.800
Even though it takes place in Boston, there's no sign of the original Cheers bar.

36:40.800 --> 36:43.860
It also doesn't quite feel the same without Sam, Woody, or Rebecca.

36:43.860 --> 36:47.760
The interactions between the two casts are interesting, but are mostly a novelty.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.760
The presence of a guy who looks suspiciously like Cheers director James Burroughs, who

36:51.760 --> 36:56.240
also directed 32 episodes of Frasier, along with cameos from a number of Cheers regulars,

36:56.240 --> 37:00.480
makes the whole episode feel like a messy celebration of the series that birthed Frasier.

37:00.480 --> 37:04.120
It might have made for a good Cheers reunion, but it being an average episode of Frasier

37:04.120 --> 37:07.840
speaks even further to how far apart these two shows have grown.

37:07.840 --> 37:11.240
The only principal cast member from Cheers still alive to not appear on Frasier at all

37:11.240 --> 37:12.240
was Christy Alley.

37:12.240 --> 37:16.360
It's been reported that the reason why was because Alley, a practicing Scientologist,

37:16.360 --> 37:18.680
didn't approve of a show about psychiatry.

37:18.680 --> 37:22.240
When asked in an interview about why Alley hadn't appeared on the show, co-creator

37:22.240 --> 37:23.240
David Lee said,

37:23.240 --> 37:30.560
I don't recall asking.

37:30.560 --> 37:34.000
The original premise for Frasier was the building of a relationship between Frasier and his

37:34.000 --> 37:43.280
father Martin.

37:43.280 --> 37:46.480
Many of the early episodes of the series include moments where Frasier and Martin make an effort

37:46.480 --> 37:56.320
to connect, and it's a bit of a struggle for them.

37:56.320 --> 38:18.800
Martin is the voice of reason when it comes to making things work.

38:18.800 --> 38:23.520
Importantly, Martin's not just being roped into a pet project of Frasier's to mend their

38:23.520 --> 38:25.640
relationship, he wants to reconnect as well.

38:25.640 --> 38:29.420
And rather than through Frasier's exercises, growing closer comes about just by them being

38:29.420 --> 38:33.120
together more often, creating new opportunities to learn about one another.

38:33.120 --> 38:37.200
It seems like a tall order, with Martin being so unlike his sons, but Kelsey Grammer summed

38:37.200 --> 38:39.200
up the dynamic nicely, saying,

38:39.200 --> 38:42.440
People always ask how Frasier and Niles came from a father like Martin.

38:42.440 --> 38:45.160
Martin's in public service, into knowing what's right and wrong.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.640
That's exactly what his sons were.

38:46.640 --> 38:51.280
On the simplest level, he was a good man, and their hope was to become the same thing.

38:51.280 --> 38:55.420
One sweet example is in the episode, Martin Does It His Way, where the Crane men bond while

38:55.420 --> 38:59.320
trying to piece together a song Martin had written decades previously he was hoping to

38:59.320 --> 39:12.220
send to Frank Sinatra.

39:12.220 --> 39:15.660
While many of the bonding moments were like this, the series also didn't shy away from

39:15.660 --> 39:17.180
other types of bonding.

39:17.180 --> 39:21.140
In Beloved Infidel, a secret is revealed about Martin and an old family friend.

39:21.140 --> 39:44.260
But eventually, Frasier finds out the truth.

39:44.260 --> 40:02.900
And the two have something to connect over.

40:32.900 --> 40:50.700
The idea of bonding over trauma is a good one,

40:50.700 --> 40:54.580
and the family connection makes it even stronger, helping forge this connection Martin and Frasier

40:54.580 --> 40:55.580
were hoping for.

40:55.580 --> 41:00.140
And by the fourth season, we started to see this father-son relationship take real shape.

41:00.140 --> 41:04.820
In Our Father Whose Art Ain't Heaven, Frasier refuses a gift from Martin, and we see what

41:04.820 --> 41:29.420
that gesture meant to the guy.

41:29.420 --> 41:47.740
And Frasier wasn't the only son connecting to Martin.

41:47.740 --> 41:50.940
Even the small gestures reveal how the two of them have grown closer together.

41:50.940 --> 42:16.620
This all raises some interesting questions about the show, if, by the halfway point,

42:16.620 --> 42:21.140
the main premise of a father and son reconnecting had already reached its conclusion.

42:21.140 --> 42:22.700
What's to be done with Martin?

42:22.700 --> 42:25.940
To understand Martin, though, it's important to take a step back and understand who his

42:25.940 --> 42:29.540
character is aside from his relationship with Frasier.

42:29.540 --> 42:32.420
Martin is often positioned on the show as the average guy.

42:32.420 --> 42:35.620
The working class everyman most of the audience can relate to.

42:35.620 --> 42:39.580
Except, Martin isn't really the average blue-collar worker he's presented as.

42:39.580 --> 42:40.860
He's a former cop.

42:40.860 --> 42:43.500
And that has an impact on how he sees the world.

42:43.500 --> 42:55.500
Here's a brief example of his politics.

42:55.500 --> 42:59.500
When Frasier is dealing with a con man in the episode, Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool

42:59.500 --> 43:08.020
Me Twice, Martin makes his feelings about people in general clear.

43:08.020 --> 43:11.900
Although we only get vague references to Martin's life before he became a cop, his time working

43:11.900 --> 43:15.460
for the force has certainly cemented the idea that people are generally bad and need

43:15.460 --> 43:18.300
the firm hand of the police to keep them in check.

43:18.300 --> 43:21.580
Throughout the series, Martin is softened quite a bit, becoming more well-versed in

43:21.580 --> 43:24.860
the finer things in life thanks to his time with Frasier, and becoming a kinder, gentler

43:24.860 --> 43:28.820
person as a result of having a stronger home life in connection with his sons.

43:28.820 --> 43:32.020
But his attitudes towards people more broadly doesn't change too much.

43:32.020 --> 43:35.740
He can't share Frasier's optimism that people are generally good, and when he's given the

43:35.740 --> 43:40.060
opportunity to offer some forgiveness of his own, he can't bring himself to do it.

43:40.060 --> 43:43.940
In the season 8 episode, A Day in May, Martin attends the parole hearing of the guy who

43:43.940 --> 43:44.940
shot him.

43:44.940 --> 43:48.820
Even after speaking with the man's mother, Martin can't bring himself to make a statement

43:48.820 --> 44:01.980
in favor of his release.

44:01.980 --> 44:05.540
Martin doesn't have to forgive the guy who shot him, but his rigidness here represents

44:05.540 --> 44:09.700
a side of him that he carries throughout the series, this skepticism towards the idea that

44:09.700 --> 44:13.220
people can change for the better, which is ironic considering in his own change throughout

44:13.220 --> 44:17.300
the series, such as finally mustering the courage to tell his sons that he loves them.

44:17.300 --> 44:45.500
Martin's struggle to connect with his sons

44:45.500 --> 44:49.140
and his cynicism towards society present a man who is trapped in certain confining

44:49.140 --> 44:50.980
elements of masculinity.

44:50.980 --> 44:54.900
We see Martin get angry when Eddie is playing with a doll, or his deep discomfort when Frasier

44:54.900 --> 44:57.780
wants to talk about his concerns that he may be gay.

44:57.780 --> 45:01.180
Martin has a very fixed idea of what it means to be a man in the world, and it's what makes

45:01.180 --> 45:02.180
him miserable.

45:02.180 --> 45:06.020
It may also be part of the reason he chose to become a police officer, a job that reflects

45:06.020 --> 45:09.100
masculinity that drenched him in cynicism.

45:09.100 --> 45:12.900
Martin is both a victim and a critique of the times he lived in, and sometimes the show

45:12.900 --> 45:14.940
goes out of its way to present that to us.

45:14.940 --> 45:36.900
Here's Martin opining on women getting pregnant out of wedlock.

45:36.900 --> 45:41.220
In later seasons of the series, Martin began something close to a redemption arc.

45:41.220 --> 45:45.700
In The Return of Martin Crane, we see Martin leave his early retirement, rejoining the working

45:45.700 --> 45:47.500
world as a security guard.

45:47.500 --> 45:51.100
Although not exactly quite the high-stakes job of his younger days, it does let him reclaim

45:51.100 --> 45:53.580
part of his life by feeling like he's part of society.

45:53.580 --> 45:57.220
It's not as though he's in dire need of assistance, with him being quite happy living

45:57.220 --> 46:00.940
with Frasier, but Martin needs something to feel like he isn't just slipping into the

46:00.940 --> 46:03.220
back pocket of someone else's life.

46:03.220 --> 46:15.860
Unadorably, part of Martin reasserting himself often involves treating his sons like kids.

46:15.860 --> 46:19.020
This happened throughout the series and was one of the few ways Martin would assert control

46:19.020 --> 46:20.020
over his life.

46:20.020 --> 46:22.700
Martin's dating life was a subject throughout the series.

46:22.700 --> 46:26.140
While he had had some success with women, it wasn't until the show's final season

46:26.140 --> 46:30.260
that he met Ronnie Lawrence, played by Wendy Mallick, a former babysitter of Frasier and

46:30.260 --> 46:31.260
Niles.

46:31.260 --> 46:44.740
It's a bit strange, considering the dynamic they used to have, though it has been over

46:44.740 --> 46:48.940
thirty years since Ronnie was a teenage babysitter working for the Cranes.

46:48.940 --> 47:08.940
Even so, Martin still feels a bit insecure.

47:08.940 --> 47:12.060
Martin eventually tells Ronnie how strongly he feels about her, and the two grow closer

47:12.060 --> 47:13.700
throughout the final season.

47:13.700 --> 47:17.260
At the beginning of the series, Martin is a crotchety old man with a funny dog who lives

47:17.260 --> 47:20.980
alone, with no real connections aside from his old buddies on the police force.

47:20.980 --> 47:25.180
By the end, he's reconnected with his sons, found new family in Daphne and Roz, managed

47:25.180 --> 47:28.900
to find his first lasting relationship since his wife passed away, a new purpose with a

47:28.900 --> 47:31.500
new job, and he still has that funny dog.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.540
Martin wasn't quite the everyman because it's difficult to believe that the average

47:34.540 --> 47:39.180
man lives a life quite as tragic as his had been in that first episode, and one drenched

47:39.180 --> 47:42.260
in so much cynicism and bitterness towards the world at large.

47:42.260 --> 47:46.900
But by making him the everyman and highlighting his journey, it reveals that life can still

47:46.900 --> 47:50.700
change, even in old age, in some of the most dire of circumstances, that you can discover

47:50.700 --> 47:53.020
a new reason to wake up every morning.

47:53.020 --> 47:56.500
Martin still carries the baggage of a cynical cop who's been shaped into someone suspicious

47:56.500 --> 48:00.060
of the world around him, but by learning to find the good in his life, from family and

48:00.060 --> 48:03.780
new friends, he's at least found some kind of happiness.

48:03.780 --> 48:06.180
Frasier writer Joe Keenan explains this saying,

48:06.180 --> 48:08.740
Martin could have stepped out of an Arthur Miller play.

48:08.740 --> 48:12.700
The guy's lost everything he's loved, his wife, job, independence.

48:12.700 --> 48:16.660
He has nothing left but his dog, chair, and two sons he feels look down on him.

48:16.660 --> 48:20.220
Keenan warm-up to them gave the show its sweetest, most hopeful long-term arc.

48:20.220 --> 48:24.940
In the episode Freudian Sleep, the cast of the show, Minus Ross, have a series of bizarre

48:24.940 --> 48:27.420
nightmares while staying at a house in the mountains.

48:27.420 --> 48:43.260
When we peer into Martin's dreams, though, they take a different tone.

48:43.260 --> 48:47.020
Of all the sections, this one was a bit of a struggle, as Eddie is the character steeped

48:47.020 --> 48:49.260
in the most scandalous of controversies.

48:49.260 --> 48:53.380
I should acknowledge first one of the big ones that he has had a long-standing feud

48:53.380 --> 49:12.740
with a certain type of bird.

49:12.740 --> 49:16.420
I'd like to remind my audience that we aren't hearing the bird side of the story for this

49:16.420 --> 49:19.780
incident, so please don't rush to judgment of this particular Blue Jay.

49:19.780 --> 49:23.500
Behind the scenes, there was also ongoing drama between the dogs who played Eddie, Moose

49:23.500 --> 49:24.780
and his son Enzo.

49:24.780 --> 49:26.500
Co-creator Peter Casey explains,

49:26.500 --> 49:28.620
Moose and Enzo hated each other.

49:28.620 --> 49:29.980
They couldn't be on the set together.

49:29.980 --> 49:34.140
Apparently it was one of those classic parent-child Hollywood rivalries.

49:34.140 --> 49:38.100
Even with all this controversy swirling about, there were a number of wonderful Eddie moments.

49:38.100 --> 49:41.140
Much of this should be credited to his trainer, Matilda Cagney.

49:41.140 --> 49:48.380
She even got a nod in one of the episodes.

49:48.380 --> 49:52.620
It's difficult to analyze the majesty and depth of the Eddie character, so I won't

49:52.620 --> 49:57.700
go into too much more detail aside from the fact that throughout the series he was, unquestionably

49:57.700 --> 50:00.700
and unwaveringly, a very good boy.

50:00.700 --> 50:05.980
There were also the revelations in his groundbreaking biography, the details of which can be safely

50:05.980 --> 50:07.740
passed over in this video.

50:07.740 --> 50:16.660
You can see this book out of your careers to learn more about this pup.

50:16.660 --> 50:20.220
One of the signature styles of Frasier was its use of farce.

50:20.220 --> 50:24.740
These comedies of errors revolved around a misunderstanding or misunderstandings spiraling

50:24.740 --> 50:25.740
out of control.

50:25.740 --> 50:29.740
An early example is the episode The Matchmaker, where Frasier's new boss thinks he's gay.

50:29.740 --> 50:49.580
Another would be the innkeepers, where Frasier and Niles open a restaurant together.

50:49.580 --> 51:13.900
Or the much beloved Ham Radio, where Frasier stages a radio play.

51:13.900 --> 51:18.020
But the most fondly remembered of these episodes, so much so that it's the favorite of many

51:18.020 --> 51:21.100
fans, is the ski lodge.

51:21.100 --> 51:24.980
After Roz wins a free trip to a ski lodge, Frasier convinces to sell it to him.

51:24.980 --> 51:29.380
So he takes Niles, Martin, Daphne, and Daphne's friend Annie, played by Cynthia LaMontagne,

51:29.380 --> 51:34.340
to enjoy a ski trip, complete with ski instructor Guy, played by James Patrick Stewart.

51:34.340 --> 51:38.940
This episode featured an elaborate ski lodge set, one of only two that was so big it was

51:38.940 --> 51:41.780
built in front of the main set of Frasier's apartment.

51:41.780 --> 51:45.760
The basic idea of this episode is that everyone, aside from Martin, is attracted to another

51:45.760 --> 51:50.360
person in that ski lodge, only no one seems to know who is into who.

51:50.360 --> 51:54.720
Frasier is into Annie, Annie is into Niles, Niles is, of course, into Daphne, Daphne

51:54.720 --> 51:57.800
is into Guy, and Guy is into Niles.

51:57.800 --> 52:00.520
Some misunderstandings lead to a few memorable moments.

52:27.800 --> 52:42.680
It's all absurdly convoluted, yet somehow still manages to work.

52:42.680 --> 52:46.160
The writer for the episode, David Lee, explains why this episode worked so well.

52:46.160 --> 52:49.120
The motivations always have to be absolutely real.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.680
It helps if they come from the heart.

52:50.680 --> 52:54.520
They can also come from lower on the anatomy, which they often do, but what really gets

52:54.520 --> 52:57.160
the audience engaged is when they care about the characters.

52:57.160 --> 53:04.440
In this case, it was Niles' feelings that you cared about.

53:04.440 --> 53:08.040
Niles and Daphne are probably the most important relationship in the series, being the only

53:08.040 --> 53:11.480
long-running story arc that lasts throughout the whole show, and one that was featured

53:11.480 --> 53:13.680
in its most watched episode.

53:13.680 --> 53:17.160
Niles and Daphne first meet in the third episode of the series, Dinner at Eight.

53:17.160 --> 53:21.320
Although Daphne happily acknowledges him, Niles' reaction is a bit more extreme.

53:21.320 --> 53:34.520
The

53:34.520 --> 53:40.280
complication here is that Niles is very much a married man to the unseen Maris, which doesn't

53:40.280 --> 53:42.440
stop him from making certain overtures.

53:42.440 --> 54:03.000
The Niles and Daphne relationship would continue like this in the early seasons of

54:03.000 --> 54:05.920
the show, though at first it wasn't supposed to happen at all.

54:05.920 --> 54:09.480
In interviews, David Hyde Pierce would tell the story of how, while doing press for the

54:09.480 --> 54:12.880
show before production began, Jane Leves would mention the idea that perhaps Daphne

54:12.880 --> 54:14.360
and Niles should get together.

54:14.360 --> 54:17.000
This manifested on the writing side in its own way.

54:17.000 --> 54:20.880
Writer-producer, N. Fletch Giordano, explains an encounter with series producer, Christopher

54:20.880 --> 54:21.880
Lloyd.

54:21.880 --> 54:24.280
Early in the first season, Niles comes to the apartment.

54:24.280 --> 54:27.840
Chris, realizing that Niles would be meeting Daphne for the first time, said, what if he

54:27.840 --> 54:29.920
had a crazy crush on her?

54:29.920 --> 54:34.360
And it was here this multi-year crush began, with many delightful misunderstandings.

54:34.360 --> 54:35.360
This is one of me psychic headaches.

54:35.360 --> 54:36.360
There's some kind of negative force out there.

54:36.360 --> 54:37.360
I only get these when there's a clawing at the cosmic continuum.

54:37.360 --> 54:38.360
Perhaps if someone robbed your temples, that's...

54:38.360 --> 54:39.360
By goodness, Dr. Crane, shouldn't you be out there mixing?

54:39.360 --> 54:40.360
Oh, don't mind me.

54:40.360 --> 54:41.360
I'm just getting some ice.

54:41.360 --> 54:42.360
Lovely party.

54:42.360 --> 54:43.360
Dr. Crane is always dropping by and bringing me little gifts, and he's not after anything.

54:43.360 --> 55:08.200
Although charming in their execution, there's something a bit strange about a married man

55:08.200 --> 55:10.720
drooling over his father's physical therapist.

55:10.720 --> 55:14.840
Though it might make Niles appear like a brute to his wife, David Hyde Pierce performed

55:14.840 --> 55:17.720
the character in a way that made his love for Maris clear.

55:17.720 --> 55:19.360
Writer Joe Keenan explains.

55:19.360 --> 55:23.120
No matter how ludicrous our descriptions got, David made Niles' feelings about the marriage

55:23.120 --> 55:24.120
very real.

55:24.120 --> 55:27.840
He knew that if Niles didn't love Maris, there'd be no reason for us to care when she divorced

55:27.840 --> 55:30.960
him, or for Niles to feel conflicted and hide his love for Daphne.

55:30.960 --> 55:35.280
That can be seen in episodes such as, An Affair to Forget, where Niles confronts Maris'

55:35.280 --> 55:40.360
fencing instructor, Gunnar, over an affair Niles suspects Gunnar is having with Maris.

55:40.360 --> 55:53.960
Luckily for Niles, he finds out Maris has remained faithful.

55:53.960 --> 55:58.240
The early flirtations between Niles and Daphne happen with the spectre of Maris around them.

55:58.240 --> 56:01.840
In spite of that barrier to them being together, there's still an obvious chemistry between

56:01.840 --> 56:02.840
them.

56:02.840 --> 56:06.720
In the first seasons, a midwinter night's dream, a storm traps Daphne at Niles' mansion

56:06.720 --> 56:26.080
while Maris is in Arizona.

56:26.080 --> 56:31.960
As Niles comforts Daphne after a recent breakup, things get heated.

56:31.960 --> 56:46.760
Dr. Crane, your glockenspielers sprung to life.

56:46.760 --> 56:53.000
Oh, the clock!

56:53.000 --> 56:56.480
Maris.

56:56.480 --> 56:59.840
You really loafer, don't you?

56:59.840 --> 57:04.680
You know, I do.

57:04.680 --> 57:07.020
Love is a funny thing, isn't it?

57:07.020 --> 57:12.520
Sometimes it's exciting and passionate, and sometimes it's something else.

57:12.520 --> 57:14.960
Something comfortable and familiar.

57:14.960 --> 57:18.040
David Hyde Pierce describes Niles' attraction to Daphne, saying,

57:18.040 --> 57:22.320
I think she's just an exotic flower to him, and she's so beautiful and it's so unusual

57:22.320 --> 57:25.960
for him to be treated by a woman with such friendliness that he's overwhelmed by that

57:25.960 --> 57:29.280
openness because Maris is so manipulative and difficult.

57:29.280 --> 57:33.280
Niles and Maris' marriage over the years deteriorates, leading to separation and then

57:33.280 --> 57:34.280
eventually divorce.

57:34.280 --> 57:39.200
It never sounded particularly happy, but whatever it was, was enough for Niles.

57:39.200 --> 57:43.160
That is, until the arrival of Daphne, which introduced something new and different to

57:43.160 --> 57:44.160
him.

57:44.160 --> 57:47.720
At first, it could simply be the echo of a wealthy man lusting after a woman of a lower

57:47.720 --> 57:52.560
class, a very old trope, and seen in classic works of literature such as Pamela.

57:52.560 --> 57:56.600
Class has a very strange place in this relationship though, as we never see Niles consider Daphne

57:56.600 --> 57:57.600
beneath him.

57:57.600 --> 58:00.560
Rather, he just seems her as different and enticing.

58:00.560 --> 58:04.560
The timing of Niles and Maris' divorce, a few years after the arrival of Daphne, does

58:04.560 --> 58:08.680
suggest that the idea of something more may have fueled its end at some level, though

58:08.680 --> 58:10.600
the series never makes that explicit.

58:10.600 --> 58:15.160
The closest sign we get is when, during his separation, Niles takes Daphne to a ball in

58:15.160 --> 58:16.920
the episode Moon Dance.

58:16.920 --> 58:20.600
What started off as an evening to show Niles' friends he wasn't sulking over Maris becomes

58:20.600 --> 58:21.600
something more than that.

58:21.600 --> 58:46.600
Niles is on the cusp of getting swept away with Daphne until he learns the truth.

58:51.600 --> 59:12.240
A crucial part of this episode is that Niles brought Daphne to impress his snooty, high

59:12.240 --> 59:13.480
society friends.

59:13.480 --> 59:17.160
The idea that Niles would show up with someone of a lower class to impress a bunch of snobs

59:17.160 --> 59:21.200
doesn't really make sense, though it does reveal that, when it comes to Daphne, Niles

59:21.200 --> 59:24.200
sees her for more than who she is in her social standing.

59:24.200 --> 59:26.920
To her being a beautiful woman, I'm sure helps as well.

59:26.920 --> 59:30.480
Although Niles clearly has romantic feelings for Daphne, part of what keeps it from getting

59:30.480 --> 59:34.020
too creepy is that, ultimately, he cares about her as a person.

59:34.020 --> 59:37.200
He may want to be with her, but he also wants her to be happy.

59:37.200 --> 59:41.640
Before his divorce with Maris, we see this in the episode Kisses Sweeter Than Wine.

59:41.640 --> 59:44.680
This reluctantly helps Daphne connect with his handyman, Joe.

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:19.360
Next season, when Daphne breaks up with Joe for good, the separated Niles and Daphne have

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.360
a nice talk.

01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:50.240
Unrequited love is

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:52.040
one of the oldest tropes in English literature.

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.760
It can be traced back to the medieval concept of courtly love, which would often entail

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:59.400
a man's desire for an unavailable woman, although when it comes to women of a lower

01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.800
class, whether or not she's unavailable never quite enters into the equation.

01:01:03.800 --> 01:01:06.920
In this instance, it actually subverts that expectation.

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:10.480
Niles doesn't see Daphne as a lower class woman he can take advantage of, but as an

01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:13.520
equal, or someone even greater than himself.

01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:17.040
It's a bit strange to square the idea that Daphne, who clearly understands and cares

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:20.880
for Niles as a friend, is still somehow oblivious to his attraction towards her.

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:35.640
Jane Leaves explains why from her own perspective.

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:40.160
This old trope of pining for an oblivious woman can create many great episodes and moments,

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.800
as the series so easily demonstrates, but it does also carry with it a more pernicious

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.640
element, and that's the objectification of Daphne.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:50.080
By objectification, I don't mean in the more commonly understood sense of highlighting

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:52.440
a woman's physical form over her character.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.000
Daphne wasn't really objectified in that way.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.880
At least, not that often.

01:01:56.880 --> 01:02:00.880
What I mean is all those delightful moments where Niles fawns over an oblivious Daphne

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:29.640
are effectively removing her from the scene as a full character.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.920
When Niles and Daphne have one of these cute little moments, there are two conversations

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.920
happening.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.800
The obvious one, in which Daphne is showing Niles how to blow a smoke ring, and the subtextual

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.400
one of Niles getting turned on by Daphne.

01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:43.920
In many of these moments, these scenes don't just include Daphne and Niles, but also have

01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:47.260
Fraser Martin present to underscore what's going on.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.160
It isn't just Niles drifting off into a world of fantasy, it's a secret conversation

01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:53.120
happening between the Crane men.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:57.040
Even a conversation that's little more than a few weighted glances.

01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.800
Even at the two layers of these moments, Niles and the other men operate on both, while

01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.960
Daphne only operates on one.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.120
In that second later, she is present, but not as an active participant, but rather an

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:11.680
unthinking element to be played against, like a prop, or an object.

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.640
The show itself acknowledges this dynamic in the episode, Perspectives on Christmas, where

01:03:15.640 --> 01:03:19.640
each of the characters describe a disastrous Christmas from their own points of view.

01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:31.360
Here's how Martin observed one of those moments.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:44.520
And here's how that same moment played out from Daphne's perspective.

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:48.080
And the show certainly doesn't shy away from making fun of her with moments like this.

01:03:48.080 --> 01:04:09.760
In the early seasons, this was a common trend for Daphne, unfortunately.

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:13.600
She was such a charmingly offbeat character that existed purely as you saw her, without

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:15.280
much of an interior life.

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:18.360
Even stories that focused on her, such as her having her boyfriend spend the night at

01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:22.580
Frasier's apartment with her, ended up becoming stories more focused on other characters,

01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:26.360
in this case Frasier and his anxiety about Daphne having a man over.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.320
This can be seen in a comment from Christopher Lloyd.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:31.160
He's describing why Niles and Daphne work as a couple.

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:34.200
I thought, could it be because she's so different than he is?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.560
He's upper class, and she's working class.

01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.560
She says what's on her mind, and he's restrained and thoughtful.

01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:43.280
Jane Lees did have some say in making Daphne a more interesting character over the years,

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.960
even filling in some of her backstory.

01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.240
She explained in an interview,

01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:48.340
Daphne was like a pair of comfy shoes.

01:04:48.340 --> 01:04:51.200
She had a sort of earthiness and honesty that definitely came from me.

01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:54.320
I told the writers that a girl who's comfortable around these men, who doesn't take any of

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:57.280
their crap, must come from a household filled with men.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:01.520
In one of the more ironic twists of the series, by being actively pursued by Niles, instead

01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:05.760
of him just loving her from afar, Daphne started to become a more well-rounded character.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:09.740
As Niles' divorce with Maris starts to get messy, he decides to change his legal representation

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:14.560
from a high-priced law firm to one of Roz's ex-boyfriends, Donnie Douglas, played by Sol

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.560
Rubinec.

01:05:15.560 --> 01:05:19.200
And while he offers an immediate reversal of fortune for Niles' finances, netting

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.440
him a nice settlement, Donnie's presence also has another unexpected consequence.

01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.040
Who understands why anything happens?

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:32.960
I mean, it's remarkable how completely one's life can change in an instant.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:33.960
Poor Niles.

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:37.740
It's over the next season and a half, things start getting messy, with Donnie and Daphne

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:42.680
getting engaged, and Niles starting to date Mel, played by Jane Addams, a plastic surgeon

01:05:42.680 --> 01:05:49.400
who had worked extensively on Maris.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:59.200
One day though, a pulled muscle in Frasier's back changes everything.

01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:03.080
While he's sitting in, and of all places, Martin's chair, Frasier ruminates about

01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:06.160
his life.

01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:34.920
A terrified Daphne tries to confirm the issue with Martin.

01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:39.980
After taking some medication, Frasier asks Daphne for a massage, which gets pretty awkward,

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:59.240
but eventually the misunderstanding is partially revealed.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:25.240
And everything is fine, until the meds Frasier took start to kick in.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:29.080
Frasier doesn't remember spilling the beans, and it appears Daphne has learned the truth

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.400
with everyone else, none the wiser.

01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:48.360
But Niles is a little more astute than everyone else.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:51.560
While dating Donnie, Daphne had gradually been revealing more of herself.

01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:55.340
We learned more about her life in Manchester, and about the things that made her happy.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.740
But this is the moment that really made her come to life as a character.

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:02.260
Maybe it's the simple fact that having a secret reveals an interior of her life, and

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:04.860
one that puts her on par with the other characters around her.

01:08:04.860 --> 01:08:08.620
In some ways, it even gives her an edge, since they don't know that she knows the truth

01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.220
about Niles' feelings for her.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:13.300
We can see that inversion very clearly in moments where Daphne and Niles have their

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:39.900
roles reversed in those little moments of subtext.

01:08:39.900 --> 01:09:06.780
It's fitting that Niles, being an old-handed this, can sense something is a mess.

01:09:06.780 --> 01:09:10.540
Things finally reach a boiling point with the Season 7 finale and two-parter, something

01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.700
borrowed, someone blue.

01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:22.660
Daphne's wedding is fast approaching, and she needs to get some things off her chest.

01:09:22.660 --> 01:09:42.100
She needs to get some things off her chest, and she needs to get some things off her

01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.100
chest.

01:09:43.100 --> 01:10:11.740
Unfortunately for Daphne, Niles and Mel have some news of their own.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:15.820
Before the wedding, Fraser notices how Niles and Daphne look at one another, and he decides

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:36.460
to confront Niles.

01:10:36.460 --> 01:11:00.780
This gives Niles the courage to finally tell Daphne the truth.

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:17.900
10 minutes later, she finally responds.

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:42.340
Although the episodes seem to end with Daphne deciding she can't leave Donnie, luckily

01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:57.820
for all of us, we still got a happy ending.

01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:02.620
After seven long years of seeing Niles and Daphne go from awkward flirtation to a romantic

01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.420
escape, it felt as though this story was reaching its climax, and that was reflected in the

01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:11.180
ratings as this was the most watched episode of Fraser, seen by nearly 34 million people

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.620
in the United States.

01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:17.620
When Niles kisses Daphne for the first time, it gave me goosebumps.

01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:21.140
I had lived with these characters for so long, as did the audience, and wanted that moment

01:12:21.140 --> 01:12:22.260
for them.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:33.020
And David Hyde Pierce shares this experience of the moment, saying,

01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:37.180
Love stories often don't extend beyond the moment when two people finally get together,

01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:39.720
and we simply expect them to live happily ever after.

01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.680
But love isn't so simple in real life, and sometimes the hardest stories to tell aren't

01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.040
about how a couple gets together, but rather how that couple stays together.

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:51.680
The moment when Daphne and Niles get together is often cited as where Fraser starts going

01:12:51.680 --> 01:12:56.560
downhill, and while ratings did begin to decline, I would argue the quality was still certainly

01:12:56.560 --> 01:13:00.080
there, only we weren't getting any more of those moments of hidden desire leading to

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.960
a comedic misunderstanding.

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:04.640
We were going to see how this couple dealt with the idea of changing their lives on the

01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:08.680
spot for a chance at a love that might only come once in a lifetime.

01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.160
When Niles and Daphne finally got together, there was a certain tension gone that had

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.080
been sustaining the series in ways we didn't understand.

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.600
When the eighth season began, it picked up right where the finale left off, with Niles

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.720
and Daphne figuring out how to navigate lives they had just destroyed.

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:26.880
Leaving your fiancé on your wedding day, and divorcing your wife on the fourth day

01:13:26.880 --> 01:13:29.880
of marriage, does create some feelings of resentment.

01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:33.280
These obstacles would be dealt with over the next couple of episodes, but I want to highlight

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.520
another important moment.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:52.760
Although Daphne had been close with the Cranes, it's only now we see her being treated more

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:53.760
like family.

01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.760
It's also a clear indicator that Fraser sees her as an equal.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:13:59.120
She effectively marries into a higher class.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.160
The episode even ends with Martin and Fraser putting together a special dinner for the

01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:03.160
new couple.

01:14:03.160 --> 01:14:07.040
The biggest challenge to the Niles and Daphne relationship is how devoid it is of any real

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.020
tension that it might end.

01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:12.560
No one can doubt for a second that Niles is hopelessly devoted to her, and Daphne seems

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.400
to be quite taken with him as well.

01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:18.440
The show plays a little with this idea when the stress of looking up to Niles' expectations

01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:21.520
leads Daphne to gain a significant amount of weight.

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:24.600
Behind the scenes this was done to accommodate Jane Leaves' pregnancy, but it did raise

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:28.000
some interesting questions about how two people can date when so much of it is based on a

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.560
love that was built on years of pining.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:50.280
How can reality ever live up to that?

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:54.840
Although Niles takes this revelation personally and the two have their first fight, they reconcile

01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:58.280
before the end of the episode, and the two manage to stay together for the rest of the

01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.280
series.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:03.240
The episodes for Niles and Daphne that stand out the most are like this one though.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:07.280
Ones where tension arises and the relationship is threatened, but at this point in the series

01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:11.680
it's unthinkable that these two would ever break up, and what tension is created is undercut

01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:12.680
because of that.

01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:17.740
There's no will they or won't they, it's very clear that they will, and have.

01:15:17.740 --> 01:15:21.000
In the same way Niles is utterly committed to Daphne, the show is utterly committed to

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:25.080
making this relationship work, spending years showing how Niles longs for her, using moments

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.600
to reveal how good the two of them are together, and revealing how much they've always cared

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:29.600
for one another.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.520
Although it's certainly possible to tell interesting stories about how a couple stays

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:36.080
together, the series had the added pressure of years of buildup that might have felt like

01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:40.080
a cruel tease had Niles and Daphne broken up a year or two after getting together.

01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:53.320
By season 9 in the episode, The Proposal, we get exactly that.

01:15:53.320 --> 01:16:06.720
Instead of a big lavish wedding, Niles and Daphne end up eloping in Las Vegas.

01:16:06.720 --> 01:16:10.600
The threats to Niles and Daphne are often external to the relationship, such as when

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:31.000
Niles faces a medical emergency and is rushed to the hospital for an operation.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:35.040
There's also the return of Maris, who re-enters Niles' life after she accidentally murders

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:43.960
her two boyfriend with a crossbow.

01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.560
The Niles and Daphne relationship is one that was defined by tension, and once that inner

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:52.200
tension was resolved, went on to face a series of tensions from outside the relationship,

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:53.960
always chasing that earlier feeling.

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.640
Although Niles and Daphne are lovely together, their on-screen dynamic only occasionally

01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:59.200
explored that relationship.

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:03.800
Instead, we had exes, near-death experiences, and murderers threatening to tear these two

01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:04.800
apart.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:08.320
When Daphne and Niles had grown so much to be together, their relationship never quite

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.980
managed to do the same.

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:13.800
When people say Fraser changed after Niles and Daphne got together, they're right,

01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:15.800
and change doesn't have to be a bad thing.

01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:21.060
But when you go to a show, in part, for the exciting romantic tension, and it's all gone,

01:17:21.060 --> 01:17:23.720
you can't help but feel as though something has been lost.

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:28.280
And the new thing might appear hollow if it seems to be an imitation of the old thing.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:33.600
There is something to be said for seeing a happy couple together instead of one in constant

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:34.600
conflict.

01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:37.380
It just wasn't as enthralling as the pursuit.

01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:40.920
It also highlights another way in which class manifests itself in the series.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:43.160
Daphne and Niles, on paper, shouldn't work.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:46.640
He's a rich psychiatrist, and she's a kooky physical therapist.

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.000
But it does work, in spite of this class divide.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.960
And it serves as a reminder that true love is possible when you're willing to ignore

01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.260
the things that don't matter, in this case, social class.

01:17:55.260 --> 01:18:00.200
Because doing so opens a door to meeting someone who represents a whole new world of possibilities.

01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:01.800
Jane Lees describes it.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:04.760
She is the complete opposite of anything he's ever known.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:08.320
She's grounded and down to earth, and that's just not the sort of person he's used to.

01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:10.480
She's not out for herself like everybody else.

01:18:10.480 --> 01:18:12.080
She's there to help others.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.480
And it turns him on to see her rooting around under the sink and fixing things.

01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:18.920
The only real journey left for them to take together is the one to parenthood.

01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:32.320
Although this is Daphne's first child, in a way this is Niles' second.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:45.920
Though the show never did answer what happened to that little bag of flour.

01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:51.920
Or maybe we do now.

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:56.680
Frasier was rightfully lauded as having a very strong record on depicting gay characters,

01:18:56.680 --> 01:18:58.600
often tackling stereotypes head-on.

01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:00.240
David Hyde Pierce explains.

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.520
It was never jokes at the expense of gay people.

01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:04.360
We had gay people on staff.

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.240
David Lee, one of the creators on the show, is gay, and so, to me, it was always acknowledging

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:11.000
the preposterousness of stereotypes.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:15.000
This dynamic was, while explained in Matt Baum's excellent video, Frasier and sitcoms

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:18.040
of the gay 90s, so give it a watch if you'd like to learn more about that.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:21.520
Instead, I'd like to talk about some other forms of representation on the series.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:25.520
NBC's lineup of sitcoms throughout much of the 90s, which Frasier was a part of on

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:29.920
Thursday's nights, was overwhelmingly white, and this wasn't an accident.

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.840
One of the executive producers of The Fresh Prince of the Balair, Andy Burrowitz, described

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:37.520
what it was like to be producing one of the few sitcoms for NBC on primetime that had a

01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.000
black cast.

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:42.880
The knee-jerk response in the network was, maybe we need more cast members on the show.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.840
They never said white, but curiously, all the characters they proposed were white.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:49.920
They believed a white audience wouldn't watch a black show.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.680
This came after programs including The Cosby Show and The Jeffersons demonstrated the opposite,

01:19:54.680 --> 01:19:58.560
but with cable channels attracting more of that TV audience, big networks such as NBC

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:02.320
started trying to appeal more to that white audience the only way they knew how, making

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:04.760
shows predominantly featuring white people.

01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:09.000
None of this is to say that Frasier was a show built specifically to appeal to white

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.600
people, but it's certainly a fact that its makeup was a perfect fit for NBC, reflected

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:17.900
in as simple a change as suggesting the Latina housekeeper on the show's original pitch

01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.720
instead be an Englishwoman.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:24.280
Frasier had a strange relationship with race, in that it says very little about it, and

01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:28.100
the one time it does, we get the episode, Something About Dr. Mary.

01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:32.800
In this episode, Frasier's temporary replacement for Roz, Mary, played by Kim Coles, starts

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:36.640
getting too comfortable participating in the show, and Frasier feels too awkward to tell

01:20:36.640 --> 01:20:51.400
her to ease up a little.

01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:56.000
Interestingly enough, in this season 7 episode, the first one to ever mention race, we get

01:20:56.000 --> 01:21:00.200
this line.

01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:04.800
A scene with three white men talking about how, perhaps, white people are being too sensitive

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.900
about racial issues, is a very 90s moment.

01:21:07.900 --> 01:21:11.640
We also have Frasier acting out a paranoid white guy fantasy of what it's like to disagree

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:39.880
with a black woman.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:22:05.280
Frasier comes clean and confesses the truth to Mary, who, of course, takes it all in stride.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:09.320
All ends well as Mary's interjections made her so popular she's offered her own show.

01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:13.240
A show with a white cast talking about race isn't impossible to do well.

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:17.560
A few years prior, Roseanne did a masterful job with White Men Can't Kiss.

01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:21.120
Frasier is a sad reminder, though, that these topics can be clumsily handled in the hands

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:24.880
of a creative team, completely divorced from the experiences they're speaking to.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:28.980
Though it does reflect quite nicely the misplaced anxieties certain white people might feel

01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:30.340
when discussing race.

01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:33.400
The show did fare slightly better over the years, introducing the less stereotypical

01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:38.280
character of Cam Winston, and having his mother Cora have a brief relationship with Martin.

01:22:38.280 --> 01:22:42.560
But these are characters for whom race is incidental, and they neatly fit into Frasier's

01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:43.900
upper class world.

01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:48.040
Another uncomfortable blind slot is the character of Maris, which only makes sense because we

01:22:48.040 --> 01:22:49.040
never see her.

01:22:49.040 --> 01:22:53.160
The show goes out of its way to describe how odd she is, being an heiress who is constantly

01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:57.320
engaging in surgeries and beauty treatments to keep herself looking young and beautiful.

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:01.800
In the episode, To Thine Old's Self Be True, we find out Maris has been struggling with

01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:07.280
an eating disorder.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.920
The episode includes much discussion about how Maris has gained so much weight that she's

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:13.880
gone from dangerously thin to dangerously overweight.

01:23:13.880 --> 01:23:22.920
In both cases, it's played for a laugh.

01:23:22.920 --> 01:23:27.000
Not being able to see Maris has always made it easy to create this bizarre entity to drive

01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:28.000
comedy.

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.560
But if we could see her in this moment, eating away her misery that Niles has moved on without

01:23:31.560 --> 01:23:34.960
her, I imagine we'd probably feel more pity than anything else.

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.960
It puts in stark relief all the other times Maris was described as being too light to

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:42.640
leave footprints in the snow, or her weight being so smaller in her youth that Frasier

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.320
was amazed she was even alive.

01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:48.680
A person that small and frail probably wouldn't be nearly as funny if you saw her in the flesh.

01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:51.520
And you could see what her eating disorder is doing to her.

01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.520
This, along with Frasier's record on race, underscores one of the sad truths about the

01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:56.520
series.

01:23:56.520 --> 01:24:00.120
It's a show about white men that struggles to see anything outside that perspective,

01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:03.880
and by not acknowledging those other perspectives makes Hei out of struggles that feel like

01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:05.160
laughing down.

01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:08.760
What keeps these episodes from getting too uncomfortable is how class acts as something

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.000
of a barrier to disguise what's happening.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.800
In something about Dr. Mary, it can be argued that the comedy comes from Frasier's lack

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:19.360
of perspective outside of his upper class world, even if the Mary character reads like

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:20.360
a stereotype.

01:24:20.360 --> 01:24:24.640
In the case of Maris, her obscene wealth makes her far less empathetic a character, even

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.840
though her disorder is incredibly tragic.

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:30.800
In both cases, it's the status of the characters that informs the audience that it's okay

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.480
to laugh at what's happening.

01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:36.600
It's another way in which class is a barrier to feeling empathy, something core to the

01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:37.600
character of Frasier.

01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:40.800
I'm certainly not saying we shouldn't laugh at the rich and powerful.

01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:44.520
In fact, I'd say we should err on the side of laughing at them more.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:49.120
But it is worth considering why we're laughing, whether it's for the silly excesses of the

01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:58.760
wealthy or the problems that impact people across class lines.

01:24:58.760 --> 01:25:03.600
Roz Doyle is a tough character to pin down, particularly in the beginning of the series.

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.160
Frasier needed someone to interact with as part of his radio show, but only a few small

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:09.360
details about the character really existed.

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:12.600
When Perry Gilpin got the role, she was told by the creative team that they weren't really

01:25:12.600 --> 01:25:17.160
sure who Roz was as a character, leaving her wide open to the actress' interpretation.

01:25:17.160 --> 01:25:18.840
Gilpin once said in an interview,

01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:22.080
I imagined Roz constantly trying to live up to a forceful mother.

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:24.800
I actually based a lot of her on a really good friend of mine.

01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:29.040
She's super smart, self-dependent, sexually adventurous, and honest about it.

01:25:29.040 --> 01:25:32.040
Although this might have led her to evolve into a cliche, she managed to be a sexually

01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:35.200
active career woman without becoming a negative stereotype.

01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:39.680
In the episode, Roz and the Dog House, we see Bulldog, the perpetual sexual harasser

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:42.760
at the station, appeal to Roz for her producing talents.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:46.680
I did not sleep with Bulldog, he didn't even hit on me.

01:25:46.680 --> 01:25:51.640
He didn't want something though, wanted me to leave you and come be his new producer.

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:56.560
Well, I wonder why he said that.

01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:00.160
Eventually we find out Roz's suspicions to be true, and Roz is quick to stand up to

01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.160
Bulldog.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.160
Get out!

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:05.160
I'll show you how to work, you disgusting farmer!

01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:06.160
Hey, hey, hey!

01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.160
You're gonna have to slow down!

01:26:07.160 --> 01:26:09.480
I'm getting some mixed signals here.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:13.800
The lesson, almost learned here, was for Roz to respect the talent of his producer, as

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:17.200
we did see how talented Roz was in helping improve Bulldog's show.

01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:20.960
But it's undercut by the reality that, in spite of her skills, Roz was still reduced

01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:23.540
to her sexual appeal by both of her bosses.

01:26:23.540 --> 01:26:26.640
This is something of a running theme for the character in the early seasons, and while

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.480
it puts her on par with Frasier and Niles, who often end up being humiliated by people

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:33.920
who know better, it hits a bit different when it's someone who doesn't have the same

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.920
degree of power or status.

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:39.240
Of all the characters on the show, it's Roz who is the most detached from the rest of

01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:40.240
the cast.

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:43.760
Much like Daphne in the earlier seasons, Roz isn't highlighted the way many of the crane

01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:47.560
men are, sometimes reduced to only having one or two scenes in an episode.

01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.720
Unlike Daphne, she doesn't get the same opportunity of character growth when she

01:26:50.720 --> 01:26:54.560
becomes involved with Niles, often leaving Roz as the odd one out.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:57.560
The most meaningful connection Roz has to the rest of the cast is her friendship with

01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:15.280
Frasier, although this does get teased as them being more than friends multiple times.

01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:18.120
Aside from one night where they hook up, the two of them never come close to anything

01:27:18.120 --> 01:27:19.120
romantic.

01:27:19.120 --> 01:27:21.800
The relationship simply works best with them being friends.

01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:24.940
The friendship between Roz and Frasier is a bit different.

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.520
Not just because of the class divide, but because Frasier is Roz's boss.

01:27:28.520 --> 01:27:32.640
It leads to some strange moments, such as the episode Roz alone, where Frasier loans

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:42.240
Roz some money, and then becomes very judgmental when he sees how she spends it.

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:58.600
Daphne is luckily there to point out how Frasier's loan of $1500 contrasts his usual

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:20.360
spending habits.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.200
It's also worth mentioning that Roz being on hard times is because Frasier got her,

01:28:24.200 --> 01:28:29.000
and everyone else at KACL, fired when he made his stand against the station manager.

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:40.640
Frasier eventually confronts Roz about her spending habits.

01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:45.200
Even their reconciliation is kind of weird, as Roz is forced to listen to Frasier's apology

01:28:45.200 --> 01:29:13.120
because she's his producer and he's doing it on the air.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.680
These power dynamics come up several times throughout the series.

01:29:15.680 --> 01:29:19.840
Frasier and Roz are absolutely friends, but they aren't quite on the same level.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.360
The tension in this relationship always seems to come from the fact that Frasier has power

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:27.080
over Roz, and reveals the perils of friendships within hierarchies.

01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.640
It's not as simple as saying, no one can ever be friends with their boss, that's obviously

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:31.640
not true.

01:29:31.640 --> 01:29:35.560
Rather, what the series suggests is that this dynamic presents a barrier or obstacle in

01:29:35.560 --> 01:29:36.640
that friendship.

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:40.720
In season 9, Roz meets Roger, a man who would be one of her longest romantic partners on

01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:41.720
the show.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.640
There are some echoes of class in that relationship as Roger is a garbage man, something that

01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:49.640
at first embarrasses Roz, but over time she learns to accept it.

01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:52.320
By the end of the season, sadly they've broken up.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:30:11.360
Although Frasier tries to reach out to her, she insists she's fine.

01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:15.720
The rest of this episode, titled Frasier has Spokane, focuses on Frasier's expanding

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:19.560
to the Spokane market, and him struggling to be accepted by the listeners there.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.040
Roz is enlisted to help out, posing as a caller looking for help.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:31:14.880
Frasier and Roz have a very real connection, and it reveals the workplace friendships are

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:16.640
just as valid as any other.

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.000
Working together was never the problem for Frasier and Roz.

01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:23.520
Roz having to answer to Frasier as her boss was what introduced a power dynamic that undercut

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:26.080
what is otherwise a very meaningful friendship.

01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:29.560
This is a reflection of what I was saying earlier about Frasier and how class creates

01:31:29.560 --> 01:31:32.000
barriers between him and the people he cares about.

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.200
Roz is clearly no exception, and while it does provide an interesting reading for her

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:40.200
character, it does frame the Frasier and Roz friendship as less about her story and more

01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.580
about his.

01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:45.280
There was one storyline for Roz that was all her own, and that was the birth of her daughter

01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.280
Alice.

01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:49.440
The birth of Alice was not planned by Roz, or even the show's producers.

01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.160
Christopher Lloyd in an interview said,

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.680
It was the network's idea.

01:31:52.680 --> 01:31:55.880
It's one of those things because they like doing event shows.

01:31:55.880 --> 01:31:59.920
And so in the season 5 episode Halloween, we find out Roz is expecting.

01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:03.560
And as is tradition for the show, it's revealed in the most embarrassing way possible.

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:07.160
If anybody's going to propose to Roz as Frasier, how could you do that?

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.160
Get her pregnant?

01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:09.160
It was Frasier.

01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.160
Listen, everybody, I am not the father of Roz's baby.

01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:16.040
In fact, we don't even know for sure if there is a baby.

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:19.880
We do now.

01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:23.760
The father is a young barista working at Cafe Nervosa, who Roz encourages to go live his

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:26.320
life as she intends to raise the baby on her own.

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:31.080
I hope that you can understand why I can't possibly marry you.

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:34.160
When I get married, it's going to be to someone I love.

01:32:34.160 --> 01:32:36.700
And someone who loves me.

01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:41.040
And someone who can legally drink champagne at my wedding.

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.040
Okay.

01:32:44.040 --> 01:32:46.040
I understand.

01:32:46.040 --> 01:32:50.040
Although Roz doesn't think this is going to be as easy to handle as she lets on.

01:32:50.040 --> 01:32:53.040
I can't take this.

01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.040
Damn it.

01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:56.040
I've let this happen.

01:32:56.040 --> 01:33:00.040
Are we still talking about the milk?

01:33:00.040 --> 01:33:02.040
Don't you see?

01:33:02.040 --> 01:33:04.040
Milk is a staple.

01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:07.040
I let a staple go bad.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:09.040
Good mothers don't let stables go bad.

01:33:09.040 --> 01:33:13.040
How can I be responsible for a child when I can't even keep fresh milk in the house?

01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.040
Kids need milk.

01:33:15.040 --> 01:33:18.040
I have to know everything.

01:33:18.040 --> 01:33:19.040
You can know half of everything.

01:33:19.040 --> 01:33:22.040
You can know about the milk and Lilith can know about the booties and the snugglies.

01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.040
You never met Lilith, did you?

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:30.040
What seemed to be the beginning of Roz's character moving in a new direction never quite gets off the ground,

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:36.040
as even the delivery of the baby is almost smuggled into an episode about Frasier and Niles competing over the same woman at a party.

01:33:36.040 --> 01:33:37.040
What is wrong with me?

01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.040
What is wrong with me?

01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:40.040
Why can't I find a single woman who's interested in me?

01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:42.040
Those are two different questions, really.

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.040
So we should just sit down and talk them both over.

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.040
Oh wait, I can't.

01:33:46.040 --> 01:33:48.040
Because I'm in labor!

01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:51.040
Still, we do get a cute moment with baby Alice.

01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:54.040
Oh, look at her.

01:33:54.040 --> 01:33:56.040
Oh, she's beautiful.

01:33:56.040 --> 01:33:59.040
Mazel tov.

01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:01.040
It's a long story.

01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.040
And that was about it.

01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:08.040
On the odd occasion, we would see Alice appear in an episode or Roz would make a reference to having to stay home because she couldn't find a babysitter.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:14.040
But otherwise, we don't get too much of a change in Roz's life, aside from maybe her dating habits slowing down a bit.

01:34:14.040 --> 01:34:18.040
One interesting bit of trivia about Roz Doyle is that she gets her name from one of the producers on Wings,

01:34:18.040 --> 01:34:21.040
the show David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee created before Frasier.

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:25.040
The real-life Roz Doyle passed away in 1991 from breast cancer.

01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:31.040
Towards the end of the series, we see some development in sight for Roz as she's offered a job as station manager at a rival radio station.

01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:34.040
I must say, I've got sort of mixed feelings about this.

01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:35.040
I mean, I couldn't be happier.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:39.040
They're finally getting the recognition you deserve, but I'm going to miss you.

01:34:39.040 --> 01:34:44.040
Well, let's wait till there's a real offer before we break out the Kleenex and Champagne.

01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.040
Roz, being so capable, gets the job.

01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.040
Well, I got the job!

01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:49.040
Oh, congratulations, Roz.

01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.040
I'm so proud of you.

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:52.040
Now, can I tell you how much I'm going to miss you?

01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.040
Yes.

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:58.040
This two-parter is a strange dynamic where Roz inserts herself into Frasier's new relationship with co-worker Julia,

01:34:58.040 --> 01:34:59.040
played by Felicity Huffman.

01:34:59.040 --> 01:35:01.040
Though, ultimately, none of this goes anywhere.

01:35:01.040 --> 01:35:07.040
Frasier breaks things off with Julia, and Roz exits the new job to go back to her old one at KACL.

01:35:07.040 --> 01:35:13.040
While a bit of an odd part of the show, it does reveal to us that Roz aspires to be something more than a producer for Frasier's show.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:16.040
And that's something we learn a little more about in the finale of the series.

01:35:22.040 --> 01:35:27.040
One major part of the series I haven't really touched on is Frasier's long-standing problems with dating.

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:32.040
Throughout the over 250 episodes of the show, we see Frasier go on countless dates,

01:35:32.040 --> 01:35:36.040
struggling to find happiness with women that are a bad fit for him, a great fit for him,

01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.040
and ones who don't stick around long enough for us to find out.

01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.040
Frasier's struggle to find a relationship is one of the core conflicts of the series.

01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:49.040
Season 9 opens with the two-parter Don Juan in Hell, where Frasier dives deep into his own mind to figure out what he wants,

01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:52.040
imagining the many women who he's had relationships with.

01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:58.040
I have carried you with me throughout every relationship, on every date.

01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:03.040
You pick apart the women I care about and you remind me how much it'll hurt if I open myself up.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:06.040
You don't help me.

01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.040
You hold me back.

01:36:08.040 --> 01:36:14.040
How will I ever move forward if I don't put you behind me?

01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:20.040
Although this two-parter led Frasier to a place of emotional strength, ready to enter into a meaningful relationship,

01:36:20.040 --> 01:36:24.040
it would be two more seasons until he found the last of the women he would earnestly pursue on the series.

01:36:24.040 --> 01:36:26.040
Charlotte, played by Laura Linney.

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:29.040
We only meet Charlotte seven episodes before the series finale,

01:36:29.040 --> 01:36:32.040
but Linney spoke about the experience of joining the cast so late in its run.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.040
I was a Frasier fan for so long.

01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:38.040
I think Charlotte's a good-hearted fumbling person trying her best, but things weren't working,

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.040
and she was beginning to lose heart a little bit.

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:45.040
In a fitting turn, Charlotte met Frasier while trying to help him make a meaningful connection as a matchmaker.

01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:50.040
After setting up a series of disastrous dates, Frasier realizes he's attracted to Charlotte.

01:36:58.040 --> 01:37:03.040
After some brief maneuvering around Charlotte's less-than-ideal boyfriend Frank, played by Aaron Eckhart,

01:37:03.040 --> 01:37:07.040
Frasier manages to get closer to Charlotte, until finding out something crucial.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:19.040
I know I should have told you sooner, but it was never the right time.

01:37:19.040 --> 01:37:22.040
Frasier and Charlotte decide to spend the last three weeks she has together,

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:27.040
and that time is drawing to a close in the final episode, two-parter, Goodnight Seattle.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:32.040
As the episode begins, we can see the cast all reaching pivotal turning points in their lives.

01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:36.040
Martin and Ronnie, having gotten engaged a few episodes earlier, are planning their wedding.

01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:40.040
A very pregnant Daphne could give birth at any moment, and unbeknownst to Roz,

01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:42.040
she has an exciting career opportunity ahead of her,

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.040
and Frasier is preparing to say goodbye to Charlotte.

01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.040
The episode opens with Frasier on a plane,

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:50.040
recounting the strange turn of events that got him aboard that flight,

01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:55.040
and it began with Frasier's agent, Bebe, letting Frasier know he has an exciting new job offer.

01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:19.040
As Frasier weighs his options, he has to say goodbye to Charlotte as she leaves for Chicago.

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:24.040
At Martin and Ronnie's wedding, disaster hits when Eddie, the ring bearer, eats the wedding ring.

01:38:31.040 --> 01:38:34.040
Daphne and Niles take Eddie to the vet, and then her water breaks.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:49.040
And just like that, she has a brand new baby boy.

01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:53.040
He's named David, which is possibly a tribute to series co-creator David Angel,

01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:56.040
who had passed away with his wife a few years prior.

01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:59.040
Martin and Ronnie arrive and get married at the vet's office.

01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:01.040
And for good measure, it's also Eddie's birthday.

01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:04.040
It only loosely enters into the plot, but I felt like it needed to be mentioned.

01:39:04.040 --> 01:39:07.040
After the wedding, Martin and Ronnie plan on moving in together,

01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:11.040
and with Daphne already moved in with Niles, it leaves Frasier finally alone in his apartment.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:17.040
As he poses for a meme, we see the end of an era as Martin's chair is moved out of the apartment.

01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:34.040
In a cute nod to the first episode, the same actor who moved in Martin's chair is also the one who takes it away.

01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:38.040
With Martin moved out, and Daphne and Niles now busy with their new son,

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:41.040
a lonely Frasier decides to take that job in San Francisco.

01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:52.040
Roz is also moving on as she's promoted to station manner at KACL.

01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:06.040
Everyone gathers in Frasier's apartment to say goodbye before he moves to San Francisco.

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:26.040
Martin's goodbye is particularly sweet, hearkening back to the first episode as he finally thanks Frasier.

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.040
And Niles, simply as Niles?

01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:58.040
The episode is capped off with Frasier reading Tennyson's poem Ulysses and braving one more change in his life, which brings us back to that flight.

01:41:08.040 --> 01:41:16.040
Frasier taking a chance on love is a nice way to bookend the series.

01:41:16.040 --> 01:41:22.040
What is life without taking those chances, making those gestures, striving for something to live for?

01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.040
Frasier's life has consistently been one about the barriers that prevent him from connecting to others.

01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:31.040
Some a product of his class, others of his own making.

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.040
It's a great irony that runs through a series about a man who makes his living helping others.

01:41:35.040 --> 01:41:43.040
His abysmal dating record is perhaps the greatest symbol of his lack of ability to connect to anything, with bad luck explaining some of his troubles and circumstance affecting the rest.

01:41:43.040 --> 01:41:51.040
Frasier deciding to take one more leap in his life and heading towards the great unknown of Chicago to be with Charlotte is him finally jumping over one of those barriers.

01:41:51.040 --> 01:41:54.040
Finally closing one of those distances.

01:41:54.040 --> 01:41:59.040
And he's also turning down a great job offer as part of it, effectively sacrificing fame and fortune for a chance at love.

01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:09.040
If Frasier began this series as a silly rich man to absorb with vanity to find real happiness in his life, the finale is him choosing not to venture deeper into that world so he might find something more meaningful.

01:42:09.040 --> 01:42:13.040
When asked his thoughts on what fate awaited Frasier, Kelsey Grammer said,

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.040
I sometimes think Frasier went to Chicago and Charlotte told him to get the hell out.

01:42:17.040 --> 01:42:18.040
That seems to be his luck.

01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:20.040
Maybe they ended up with a wonderful life together.

01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:23.040
And maybe we'll find out someday.

01:42:23.040 --> 01:42:26.040
Goodnight Seattle, we love you!

01:42:26.040 --> 01:42:33.040
Kelsey Grammer had been mentioning the possibility of a reboot as far back as 2018, with plans originally being a third act for Frasier in a whole new setting.

01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.040
The plan was, at first, to have it air in 2020, though that never materialized.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:46.040
On February 24th, 2021, it was revealed that the series would be streaming exclusively on Paramount+, with hopes of it premiering sometimes in 2022.

01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:49.040
So far, there's no concrete news of a date or even cast.

01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:53.040
The only thing we know for certain is that Kelsey Grammer will once again be reprising the role of Frasier.

01:42:53.040 --> 01:43:02.040
Several cast members of Frasier have been asked if they're participating, but so far no one has conferred much of anything, aside from them being aware that it will be happening.

01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:06.040
The cultural impact and lasting legacy of Frasier extends well into the future.

01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:09.040
It's a bit difficult to describe, so I got some help to explain that.

01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:13.040
Hey, this is Hootz from the YouTube channel Little Hoot.

01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:20.040
I'm creating a companion video to Jose's on Frasier that's a collaboration with Neil from The Liberal Cook.

01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:34.040
In it, Neil and I attempt to suss out Frasier's legacy, and in doing so, we touch on a broad range of topics, including the misogyny of 90s comedy, philosopher Ahana Arendt, TV tropes, and Anita Hill.

01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:38.040
It's kind of a wild one, and I hope you enjoy.

01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:41.040
It's hard to overstate how well-received Frasier was.

01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:53.040
In addition to being a hit with strong ratings throughout its run, Frasier also managed to win 37 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most ever for a completed TV series, until that record was broken by Game of Thrones in 2016.

01:43:53.040 --> 01:44:04.040
Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce both won four Emmys for their respective portrayals of Frasier and Niles, and Frasier won Outstanding Comedy Series five years in a row, a feat only matched by Modern Family.

01:44:04.040 --> 01:44:09.040
The series has also spawned a number of home releases, books, and other forms of merchandise over the years.

01:44:09.040 --> 01:44:17.040
It's also been playing in heavy syndication as well, letting whole new generations of people discover Frasier, joking and describing how new viewers react to the show, saying,

01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:21.040
I think new viewers like the show because, apart from its quality, it doesn't remind them of anything.

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:27.040
No one says, oh, yet another show about two relentlessly highbrow romantically thwarted psychiatrists.

01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:37.040
Following the end of Frasier, Kelsey Grammer would go on to be involved in countless TV and film projects over the years, from appearing as beasts in the X-Men movies to being the executive producer of the TV series Girlfriends.

01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:45.040
He is still likely best remembered for the 20 years he spent playing Frasier, though he spent even more time, 29 years in fact, playing sideshow Bob on The Simpsons.

01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:54.040
And I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that The Simpsons had a number of Frasier references in those episodes, including guest appearances by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney.

01:44:54.040 --> 01:45:03.040
David Hyde Pierce continued to have a number of TV and film roles, though he tended more towards working on stage, including winning a Tony for his role in the 2007 production of Curtains.

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:10.040
His performances on Frasier were typically noted for how keenly they reacted to the audience, so a career on stage makes perfect sense for Pierce.

01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:15.040
John Mahoney appeared in several roles after Frasier, though Martin Crane would always be his signature performance.

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:21.040
Sadly, on February 4th, 2018, Mahoney passed away due to complications from throat cancer.

01:45:21.040 --> 01:45:24.040
In an interview, Perry Gilpin told a sweet story about Mahoney.

01:45:24.040 --> 01:45:27.040
A few years ago, John took me and my family to dinner in Chicago.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:32.040
While we were driving back, my husband was texting with Chris Lloyd and read Chris's text out loud.

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.040
Please tell the great John Mahoney it was one of the honors of my life to work with him.

01:45:37.040 --> 01:45:39.040
I could see a little tear for him in John's eye.

01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:42.040
Then my daughter says, Who's John Mahoney?

01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.040
John almost fell out of the car laughing.

01:45:44.040 --> 01:45:46.040
He never took himself too seriously.

01:45:47.040 --> 01:45:54.040
Jane Leves continued her career throughout the 2000s after the end of Frasier, eventually finding herself on Hot in Cleveland, which ran for six seasons.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:46:00.040
She took some time off of television after that, though eventually returned to the drama series The Resident, which is currently in its fifth season.

01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:06.040
Perry Gilpin has been working in film and TV since the end of Frasier and has also built a fairly extensive list of credits doing voiceover work.

01:46:06.040 --> 01:46:12.040
She even has the unique distinction of being part of the ill-fated Final Fantasy The Spirits Within.

01:46:12.040 --> 01:46:18.040
In addition to Frasier, Moose also appeared in the feature film My Dog Skip once again alongside his son Enzo.

01:46:18.040 --> 01:46:23.040
Sadly, on June 22, 2006, Moose passed of natural causes at the age of 15.

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:29.040
Enzo would pass not long after on June 23, 2010, at the age of 14, due to cancer.

01:46:29.040 --> 01:46:32.040
Both will be remembered as two of the very best boys.

01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:38.040
Class looms heavily in Frasier, often as a barrier from preventing people from making genuine connections.

01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:47.040
The very idea of people in the upper class is consistently a source of mockery, but more importantly, it's also demonstrated to be a driver of division and a barrier for loving compassion.

01:46:47.040 --> 01:46:54.040
Frasier does a wonderful service by showing us that this excess doesn't make anyone better. It's a social structure that moves us away from one another.

01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:58.040
Reflected on the show, David I. Pierce describes how it connects people, saying,

01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:12.040
that I no longer think of it as a coincidence, but as part of the show's legacy.

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:20.040
Frasier was a show about connecting through unlikely circumstances, but the circumstances weren't the living arrangements, but the way their social spheres shaped them.

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:24.040
The idea that these barriers can be torn down makes it much easier to laugh together.

01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:28.040
No matter how hard the times might get, that's what makes Frasier such an excellent show.

01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:36.040
When I made that Cheers retrospective a while ago, I knew it had to be a two-parter, and I knew I would eventually have to speak about Frasier.

01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:46.040
Growing up, I didn't really watch Cheers, but I definitely watched Frasier, so revisiting it all these years later was a treat and a reminder of why this show was such a joy to watch in my youth.

01:47:46.040 --> 01:47:51.040
It held up surprisingly well, and I think that's a tribute to the writing and performances throughout it.

01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:57.040
If you enjoyed this lengthy look back at the show Frasier, do consider becoming a patron or member for this channel.

01:47:57.040 --> 01:48:04.040
You'll join all the lovely names you see scrolling up on the screen now, plus you'll get early access to videos in the future.

01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:10.040
Patrons also get a little extra say on which series comes next, though I can't make any promises as to which you'll be covering.

01:48:10.040 --> 01:48:13.040
Thank you all so much for watching!
