00:00.000 --> 00:08.560
Oh god, this one is even worse.

00:08.560 --> 00:14.960
When we last met, I was wading through the sewage of Ben Shapiro's 2016 novel, True

00:14.960 --> 00:15.960
Allegiance.

00:15.960 --> 00:22.080
In that video, I mentioned an earlier book in the Ben Shapiro-Ura, a collection of short

00:22.080 --> 00:29.400
stories from 2015 titled What's Fair and Other Short Stories, released on Amazon.com

00:29.400 --> 00:30.680
as an e-book.

00:30.680 --> 00:35.960
This title seems to be less popular than Ben Shapiro's 2016 novel, based on its limited

00:35.960 --> 00:38.280
release and lower review count.

00:38.280 --> 00:44.060
It bills itself as a collection of short stories, but there are only three, which I guess meets

00:44.060 --> 00:46.300
the technical definition of a collection.

00:46.300 --> 00:49.520
But it makes for a far shorter read than I expected.

00:49.520 --> 00:51.960
Ben's stories cover three genres.

00:51.960 --> 00:56.840
There's Americana, sci-fi, and a 16-year-old's LiveJournal page.

00:56.840 --> 01:00.960
But to truly see the man at his craft, we'll have to dive right in.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.460
Let's go.

01:02.460 --> 01:07.280
The titular story in this little tome is What's Fair.

01:07.280 --> 01:12.860
In true Ben Shapiro fashion, this story feels like someone trying to cram a bad novel into

01:12.860 --> 01:18.040
a few pages and reducing it to a series of basic plot points, all fired off at a rapid

01:18.040 --> 01:19.200
pace.

01:19.200 --> 01:23.120
This story is told through the eyes of Tommy, who relates his long and troubled history

01:23.120 --> 01:24.960
with his older brother Jim.

01:24.960 --> 01:29.260
The two grew up on a farm in rural America, and we get a few scenes to illustrate how

01:29.260 --> 01:33.720
jealous Tommy is of Jim, typically through the framing of whether or not what happened

01:33.720 --> 01:37.120
is fair, at least through Tommy's eyes.

01:37.120 --> 01:43.200
The story is written with a painful, homespun narration style, as Ben tries his best to

01:43.200 --> 01:47.160
make it sound like he's channeling a genuine American rustic.

01:47.160 --> 01:48.160
Here's a sample.

01:48.160 --> 01:53.120
I remember a time when I was a kid that Dad gave me and Jim Christmas presents.

01:53.120 --> 01:56.840
He gave Jim a wristwatch and he gave me a hunting knife.

01:56.840 --> 01:59.040
Boy was Jim taken with that wristwatch.

01:59.040 --> 02:04.920
He'd wear it around every day, rain or shine, always careful to keep it clean, to keep it

02:04.920 --> 02:05.920
wound.

02:05.920 --> 02:10.520
If he scuffed it up, he'd buff that scuff right out, and he'd spend hours with a

02:10.520 --> 02:16.640
handkerchief spitting on it and rubbing it, spitting on it and wiping it until it looked

02:16.640 --> 02:17.640
brand new.

02:17.640 --> 02:21.680
Now if that sounds like it would be annoying to read, you would be right.

02:21.680 --> 02:25.000
In this story, Tommy is jealous of Jim's wristwatch.

02:25.000 --> 02:28.760
And even though he tries to make the best of it by going hunting with his knife, Tommy

02:28.760 --> 02:30.880
eventually loses it in a creak.

02:30.880 --> 02:33.040
A detail to remember.

02:33.040 --> 02:37.920
Next we flash forward in time and Tommy is a senior in high school and Jim is at a nonspecific

02:37.920 --> 02:41.680
college that's only ever referred to as State.

02:41.680 --> 02:47.120
Tommy has just met Emily, shortened to M. As the star fullback on his school's football

02:47.120 --> 02:52.400
team, Tommy has his pick of girls, but he's settled on M, the head cheerleader.

02:52.400 --> 02:56.400
He's not only sweet on her, he's convinced M is his future wife.

02:56.400 --> 03:01.240
If you're rolling your eyes right now thinking this is some 1950s cliche, you'd be surprised

03:01.240 --> 03:05.720
to know that this story takes place in the 90s, or at least the 90s at the very earliest

03:05.720 --> 03:10.720
since Tommy refers to M as a miniature Britney Spears.

03:10.720 --> 03:14.720
I'm not sure why she's miniature since a high school senior is nearly a full grown

03:14.720 --> 03:15.720
adult.

03:15.720 --> 03:20.480
With his parents out of town, Tommy brings M back to his place so they can hook up.

03:20.480 --> 03:25.120
Instead he finds Jim has come home for the weekend from State.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.520
Then we get this exchange.

03:27.520 --> 03:29.600
And that's when Jim opened the door.

03:29.600 --> 03:34.120
He was back from State where he was studying agriculture engineering and he looked at me

03:34.120 --> 03:38.520
laughing with his eyes and said, hey brother, I'm home.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.920
When I turned back to introduce M, she was looking at him.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.080
They were married six months later.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.920
That must have been one hell of a look.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.640
And that's quite a jump for two sentences in the same paragraph.

03:49.640 --> 03:52.080
We never really find out why M isn't a Jim though.

03:52.080 --> 03:53.080
She just is.

03:53.080 --> 03:59.080
In the next paragraph, Tommy and Jim's father dies and their mother sinks into a deep depression.

03:59.080 --> 04:03.480
The farm falls into peril and Jim and M move back home to take care of things.

04:03.480 --> 04:07.640
Soon afterwards, their mother tries to drown herself in the bathtub, but survives the

04:07.640 --> 04:09.880
attempt and is left with brain damage.

04:09.880 --> 04:11.880
And this all sounds like it's moving too quickly.

04:11.880 --> 04:15.240
I've literally just covered two paragraphs of this story.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.160
Its pace is manic.

04:18.160 --> 04:21.640
And if you're wondering if there are any more details on the mother character, let

04:21.640 --> 04:22.800
me stop you right there.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.800
We don't learn a thing about who this woman is or why she does what she does.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.200
She's literally just a perpetual burden on her family.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.720
And she doesn't even get a name.

04:31.720 --> 04:36.920
Tommy was going to be a football player at State, but he hurts his knee, losing his scholarship,

04:36.920 --> 04:38.360
and he's forced to drop out.

04:38.360 --> 04:43.280
And now the family is just stagnating at the farm when Jim gets this big idea.

04:43.280 --> 04:47.080
He's thought of a special plow that will make the millionaires.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.720
While he begins tinkering with that machine for weeks on end, all the work lends on M

04:51.720 --> 04:57.000
and Tommy, who putter along muttering annoyances about the absent-minded Jim.

04:57.000 --> 04:59.560
Eventually their mother starts a fire in her room.

04:59.560 --> 05:03.920
Tommy and M race to help her while Jim is too busy with his machine to notice.

05:03.920 --> 05:07.560
Just barely, Tommy and M are able to save Mother.

05:07.560 --> 05:12.480
Tommy, obviously upset with his brother who did not notice their mother nearly burning

05:12.480 --> 05:18.320
to death in her room, decides to confront Jim in a tense scene in the barn.

05:18.320 --> 05:21.160
Sure enough, Jim was under that plow again.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.640
I stood there for a minute, then two.

05:23.640 --> 05:27.440
It must have taken the bastard five solid minutes to notice me.

05:27.440 --> 05:33.040
When he did, he got out from under the plow, stood up, gave a kind of little smile, and

05:33.040 --> 05:35.000
asked what was wrong.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.720
And I knocked him flat on his ass.

05:37.720 --> 05:43.480
Listen, Jim, I said to him, you've been having it your own way all this time, but some things

05:43.480 --> 05:45.040
are gonna change.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.800
You've been king of this place for our whole life, but I've had enough of it.

05:48.800 --> 05:51.040
I want my peace.

05:51.040 --> 05:53.160
There's so much to say about this exchange.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.680
Tommy is so pissed.

05:54.680 --> 05:59.800
He storms into the barn and then stands there for five minutes?

05:59.800 --> 06:02.000
That doesn't seem particularly mad.

06:02.000 --> 06:06.040
And then, instead of confronting Jim about his negligence nearly getting their mother

06:06.040 --> 06:10.400
killed, he instead starts talking about wanting his peace.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.840
Tommy never mentions his mother in this scene.

06:12.840 --> 06:18.000
He just whines about things and being unfair, with Jim getting all the breaks.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.840
Jim responds by turning into a character from an Ayn Rand novel.

06:21.840 --> 06:26.120
Tommy, he said, you don't do anything of importance around here.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.200
You think I need you to run this place?

06:28.200 --> 06:31.320
I could hire a field hen for one quarter the price.

06:31.320 --> 06:33.800
I'm doing it out of charity for you.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.560
You've never held down a real job.

06:35.560 --> 06:39.440
You're still going on and on about your days back in high school.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.840
Nobody cares anymore.

06:40.840 --> 06:42.340
I produce.

06:42.340 --> 06:44.920
The spark in his eyes was beginning to return.

06:44.920 --> 06:47.600
I knew this meant he was especially mad.

06:47.600 --> 06:48.960
You aren't worth anything.

06:48.960 --> 06:50.320
You've got no education.

06:50.320 --> 06:51.880
You've got no prospects.

06:51.880 --> 06:54.440
You know what dad told me before I left to school?

06:54.440 --> 06:56.120
He said, look after Tommy.

06:56.120 --> 07:00.280
If anything happens, Jimmy, he can't take care of himself.

07:00.280 --> 07:02.320
Just what do you think I've been doing?

07:02.320 --> 07:06.360
I started to talk, but he gave me a look that said I'd better shut my mouth.

07:06.360 --> 07:07.640
He kept going.

07:07.640 --> 07:10.400
You know what I've been doing in this barn all this time?

07:10.400 --> 07:14.520
Trying to make something for myself and for Am, sure, but mostly I've been trying to

07:14.520 --> 07:16.320
take care of you.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.440
Still, even though you're sullen and you're lazy and you're ungrateful and you think

07:20.440 --> 07:25.720
somehow I've cheated you, even though I spent years helping you with your homework, teaching

07:25.720 --> 07:30.160
you the rules of football, hell, I even got that man from state to come see you play.

07:30.640 --> 07:34.720
When this thing makes us a million bucks, I'm planning on sending you back to college

07:34.720 --> 07:36.800
so you can make something of yourself.

07:36.800 --> 07:41.120
But if you want to leave, you pick up and you get the hell out.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.760
This diatribe reframes the entire story for us.

07:43.760 --> 07:49.600
Now we see Tommy as the big dumb idiot and Jim as the smart, intelligent brother who's

07:49.600 --> 07:51.600
just trying to help everyone out.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.720
Tommy is just too dumb to see it.

07:53.720 --> 07:58.400
Jim's kind offer to take care of his brother is supposed to make him look magnanimous.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.600
Even after he basically told him he's a useless idiot.

08:01.600 --> 08:06.480
Since Jim is a producer, we're supposed to think it's okay that he treats his brother

08:06.480 --> 08:08.120
with such disdain.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.880
And maybe Tommy is a loser.

08:10.880 --> 08:16.400
Maybe his choice of focusing on athletics over academics and then him ending up getting

08:16.400 --> 08:21.640
injured blew his entire future and the guy lost his high school crush to his brother.

08:21.640 --> 08:26.200
Tommy has had a rough time of it and maybe he needs a reality check to snap him out of

08:26.200 --> 08:30.200
this funk and get him to take responsibility for himself.

08:30.200 --> 08:33.240
But you know what that speech doesn't excuse?

08:33.240 --> 08:36.120
Letting your mother die in a fire.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.640
That's how this critical speech completely fails.

08:38.640 --> 08:43.520
If we're supposed to take Jim's side here, it would be a lot easier if he, the supposedly

08:43.520 --> 08:48.760
responsible brother, hadn't nearly let his mother die in a fire.

08:48.760 --> 08:52.960
Also Jim technically hasn't done all that much yet.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.760
Tommy and Em run the farm and they're supposed to just assume Jim will invent their way into

08:57.760 --> 08:58.760
a fortune.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.720
The story gives us no reason to believe this will happen.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.960
And if anything, Jim comes off as unbearably smug in this monologue.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.680
So naturally, Ben has decided he's the good guy in this story.

09:09.680 --> 09:14.320
After this, we move on to a scene where Tommy runs into Em late at night, finding her sobbing

09:14.320 --> 09:18.840
about her miserable life as a farm wife taking care of a sick old woman.

09:18.840 --> 09:22.560
Tommy figures this is a great time to talk about hooking up again.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.160
Naturally, it doesn't work.

09:24.160 --> 09:29.240
Embarrassed at his lack of game, Tommy runs into the woods and while passing by the creek,

09:29.240 --> 09:32.560
he finds his old knife, sparkling like new.

09:32.560 --> 09:38.000
I'm not sure how this knife is still in such good shape and hasn't moved in the last 15

09:38.000 --> 09:42.440
years, but such is the magic of forced storytelling.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.600
A few days later, Jim calls Tommy into the barn to tell him his new plow has finally

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
been finished.

09:47.600 --> 09:51.440
He brings Tommy into the barn to take a look and to talk about how their lives are about

09:51.440 --> 09:55.560
to take a turn for the better and then this predictable twist happens.

09:55.560 --> 09:57.960
This is Tommy talking to Jim.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.000
He hopped over to me like a jackrabbit and grabbed me by the arms.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.360
Kiddo, we're all set from here to the flood.

10:04.360 --> 10:08.240
You're a junior partner in the firm and we're headed right to the top.

10:08.240 --> 10:09.720
His smile was infectious.

10:09.720 --> 10:12.360
I could feel myself smiling too.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.940
And then the knife was up under his ribs.

10:14.940 --> 10:17.480
He looked so confused for a minute.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.680
I was confused too.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.120
I can explain it to you, Tommy.

10:21.120 --> 10:26.200
It turns out you were in a very forced and contrived retelling of the Cain and Abel story.

10:26.200 --> 10:28.080
One jealous brother murders the other.

10:28.080 --> 10:32.440
Unlike Cain, though, Tommy gets away with the crime by pretending the plow is what killed

10:32.440 --> 10:33.440
his brother.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.800
Or at least, he seems to get away with the crime.

10:35.800 --> 10:40.080
In the next scene, Tommy tries to sell the plow to make those millions, but he can't

10:40.080 --> 10:41.500
get it to work.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.800
Turns out there's something wrong that I guess Jim can only fix.

10:45.800 --> 10:51.280
So Tommy goes home with no money and a busted plow, and eventually packs up and leaves the

10:51.280 --> 10:55.960
farm and Tommy is left alone taking care of his sick mother.

10:55.960 --> 11:02.160
What this story is so pointedly pressing upon us is the idea that people are born with unalterable

11:02.160 --> 11:07.160
traits, essential components that make them who they are which can never be changed.

11:07.160 --> 11:10.080
Tommy was born dumb and Jim was born smart.

11:10.080 --> 11:14.360
Their lives reflect this internal trait and they have no way of escaping this biological

11:14.360 --> 11:15.360
reality.

11:15.360 --> 11:20.280
What Tommy can hope for is Jim taking care of him, and all Jim needs from Tommy is for

11:20.280 --> 11:22.560
Tommy to get the hell out of his way.

11:22.560 --> 11:26.840
What's most strange about this story is it pretends circumstances are meaningless and

11:26.840 --> 11:31.440
that even when you have a person like Tommy who is apparently cared for, he still can't

11:31.440 --> 11:33.720
escape the loneliness he was born with.

11:33.720 --> 11:38.760
I'll have more to say about this idea of essentialism during the third story.

11:38.760 --> 11:44.760
You know, I did like the idea of an unreliable narrator whose bias is revealed when confronting

11:44.760 --> 11:46.840
the characters he covets.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.880
Maybe in the hands of a talented writer?

11:48.880 --> 11:50.780
This could have actually been really good.

11:50.780 --> 11:54.720
But here's a spoiler for the next two stories before we get into those.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.440
What's fair is easily the best story in the book.

11:58.440 --> 12:03.360
And with that ominous revelation, let's move on to the next one.

12:03.360 --> 12:08.920
Our next stop in the Shapiroverse is the science fiction story From the Pit.

12:08.920 --> 12:14.100
This is a tale of the far future where our hero, a man named Kemp, is fighting for his

12:14.100 --> 12:19.380
survival against hordes of dust mites for the sake of his rich benefactor.

12:19.380 --> 12:21.540
And yes, I did say dust mites.

12:21.540 --> 12:27.400
In this vision of the future, a wealthy man, only referred to as the whale, hires thousands

12:27.400 --> 12:31.940
of people to be shrunk down to less than a millimeter, which is about four hundredths

12:31.940 --> 12:35.140
of an inch, so they can shoot dust mites in the face.

12:35.140 --> 12:39.260
Now before we continue with the plot, I need to acknowledge that this is maybe the dumbest

12:39.260 --> 12:41.980
plan to eliminate dust mites I've ever heard.

12:41.980 --> 12:46.180
Why not, say, make the humans big enough that the dust mites can't harm them and

12:46.180 --> 12:48.100
just spray them like roaches?

12:48.100 --> 12:52.400
Why not skip shrinking humans entirely and use chemicals from the get-go?

12:52.400 --> 12:55.500
Why not just write a story that doesn't have such a bad premise?

12:55.500 --> 12:59.820
Of all the stories in this collection, this one is in the most desperate need of some

12:59.820 --> 13:00.820
copy editing.

13:00.820 --> 13:03.300
Here's an actual sentence from the story.

13:03.300 --> 13:04.800
Two years.

13:04.800 --> 13:08.260
That was the length of that damnable contract.

13:08.260 --> 13:10.780
I though the money would enough.

13:10.780 --> 13:12.460
Did no one read this over?

13:12.460 --> 13:15.460
I though the money would enough.

13:15.460 --> 13:21.280
And the rest of the paragraph reads, a guaranteed pension for life, an endless income, a nice

13:21.280 --> 13:27.340
house above the bay with the wind blowing off the sea, Amy in my arms.

13:27.340 --> 13:29.940
She warned me against this.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.540
She was right.

13:31.540 --> 13:34.300
I was wrong.

13:34.300 --> 13:38.340
Sentences either run on for way too long or they're too short and snippy.

13:38.340 --> 13:43.080
It doesn't use commas properly and I though the money would enough.

13:43.080 --> 13:46.900
And don't worry, that's not even the worst grammatical flub in this story.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.660
But back to the plot.

13:48.660 --> 13:53.020
Kemp pines for Amy, an absent love interest that reminds us he has something to live for

13:53.020 --> 13:56.140
in light of the horrors that come.

13:56.140 --> 14:00.620
Kemp fights a bunch of dust mites in a confusing battle scene where he's hanging off the side

14:00.620 --> 14:06.460
of a cigarette when the whale, a clean freak who is also a compulsive smoker, decides to

14:06.460 --> 14:08.740
light up the cigarette and take a drag.

14:08.740 --> 14:13.380
In the chaos, Kemp falls into the whale's mouth and thanks to his little protective

14:13.380 --> 14:18.860
bubble called a halo, he manages to affix himself to the side of the whale's stomach.

14:18.860 --> 14:23.940
A man trapped in the belly of a whale is an obvious reference to the story of Jonah and

14:23.940 --> 14:26.380
the whale from the Old Testament.

14:26.380 --> 14:31.180
In that story, after Jonah turned his back on his mission as a prophet, God had him swallowed

14:31.180 --> 14:34.100
up for a few days by a giant fish.

14:34.100 --> 14:37.100
Jonah eventually is thrown up and then becomes a prophet.

14:37.100 --> 14:41.440
In this story, Kemp is learning the error of wanting to make money from a rich guy who

14:41.440 --> 14:44.500
has a really weird method of killing dust mites.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.760
So not exactly the same.

14:46.760 --> 14:49.040
Or similar.

14:49.040 --> 14:52.980
While sitting in the stomach, Kemp sees the awful truth about the whale.

14:52.980 --> 14:54.440
He has a tumor.

14:54.440 --> 14:58.540
And an ulcer, which is something I'm just mentioning because it'll be used as a plot

14:58.540 --> 15:00.140
device later on.

15:00.140 --> 15:03.060
Somehow Kemp knows the tumor is really bad.

15:03.060 --> 15:05.900
So bad that the whale will be dead in a couple of months.

15:05.900 --> 15:10.400
We haven't gotten any information that Kemp has any sort of medical training or knowledge.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.060
This is just something he knows.

15:13.060 --> 15:17.220
This knowledge about the tumor could make Kemp fabulously wealthy.

15:17.220 --> 15:20.500
And that does make sense knowing that some big important business dude is going to be

15:20.500 --> 15:24.100
dead in a couple of months is prime blackmail material.

15:24.100 --> 15:28.020
Kemp though isn't a bastard and doesn't want to take advantage of this situation.

15:28.020 --> 15:32.700
Kemp radios his buddy Jensen, letting him know he's trapped in the stomach and that

15:32.700 --> 15:34.580
he's seen the whale's tumor.

15:34.580 --> 15:37.700
He promises not to say a word about it to anyone.

15:37.700 --> 15:42.500
Jensen tries speaking to the whale, but he doesn't believe Kemp and decides he's just

15:42.500 --> 15:43.980
going to kill him.

15:43.980 --> 15:49.220
It's at this point in the story where we get a truly mystifying line that, I suspect, is

15:49.220 --> 15:51.260
the subtext for this entire story.

15:51.260 --> 15:55.600
I'm going to be a bit of a jerk though and not reveal it until we get to the very end.

15:55.600 --> 16:01.320
As we move along, try and guess what this story is secretly an allegory for.

16:01.320 --> 16:06.040
The whale calls a doctor to have Kemp killed, and their plan is to send in robotic dust

16:06.040 --> 16:08.400
mites to hunt him down.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.200
These were going to eventually replace shrinking humans down to fight dust mites, and I don't

16:13.200 --> 16:17.780
know why they just didn't start with the robots, but this is the story we have.

16:17.780 --> 16:21.480
Inside the stomach, Kemp has decided he's just going to let himself grow back to full

16:21.480 --> 16:24.040
size and rip his way out of the whale.

16:24.040 --> 16:27.960
And to do that, he's going to have to fight his way through the robotic dust mites.

16:27.960 --> 16:34.080
Reversion to his normal size is a gradual process for Kemp, so at this point, he's

16:34.080 --> 16:39.520
about twice his starting size, so probably one tenth of an inch, assuming he started

16:39.520 --> 16:42.440
off as slightly larger than a dust mite.

16:42.440 --> 16:47.520
As the dust mites tear open the halo protecting Kemp, he comes out fighting, kicking his way

16:47.520 --> 16:49.960
past them and climbing up the stomach lining.

16:50.040 --> 16:55.600
Of course, since his tiny little clothes have all ripped off, he's doing it naked, burning

16:55.600 --> 16:57.680
his hands and feet on the stomach lining.

16:57.680 --> 17:03.120
As he climbs into the esophagus, one of the dust mites bites off Kemp's leg.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.760
Then we get this doozy of a typo.

17:05.760 --> 17:10.680
For context, Kemp is pulling himself into the esophagus, which looks like a constricting

17:10.680 --> 17:12.520
ring from his perspective.

17:12.520 --> 17:19.160
Finally, I pry the damn thing open, pull myself halfway through, and it closes around

17:19.160 --> 17:20.160
my waist.

17:20.160 --> 17:24.280
I'm trapped, the clicking sounds of the mites closer and closer.

17:24.280 --> 17:29.000
I'm sorry, it closes around your… what?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.480
Your waist?

17:30.480 --> 17:37.760
Is Kemp in the process of relieving his bowels here, or did someone just not know how to

17:37.760 --> 17:38.760
spell waist?

17:39.320 --> 17:43.120
Of course, I'm sure Ben knows how to spell waist properly.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.880
This just speaks to the importance of copy editors and how they're your friends, and

17:46.880 --> 17:51.120
if you employ one and have them look over your work, they'll keep it from looking

17:51.120 --> 17:53.120
like waist.

17:53.120 --> 17:58.640
Somehow Kemp pulls himself to safety and uses what's left of the stomach acid to cauterize

17:58.640 --> 17:59.880
the wound.

17:59.880 --> 18:05.640
Of course, acid liquefies flesh, making it a horrible fluid to cauterize anything.

18:05.640 --> 18:11.200
Missing a leg and sitting in the esophagus, Kemp decides he'll have a little nap.

18:11.200 --> 18:15.200
And by little nap, I mean really long sleep.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.200
September 23rd.

18:16.200 --> 18:19.400
I've lost all sense of time.

18:19.400 --> 18:25.760
I can tell by my size, I'm now about 3 inches tall, that it's been another 36 hours.

18:25.760 --> 18:30.960
How can you lose all sense of time and then be able to tell it's been 36 hours?

18:30.960 --> 18:36.440
And how on earth did the whale go 36 hours without eating any food that would have surely

18:36.440 --> 18:38.040
dislodged Kemp?

18:38.040 --> 18:46.400
And how did he sleep, I guess standing up, in the esophagus, missing a leg for 36 hours?

18:46.400 --> 18:50.960
It's at this point Kemp revises his plan, instead opting to climb out of the esophagus

18:50.960 --> 18:54.120
instead of just bursting through the whale's guts.

18:54.120 --> 18:59.400
And we get this funny little scene where Kemp punches the whale from inside of his throat.

18:59.400 --> 19:03.840
It's stupid and random, but it's the only part of the story I liked, it's just this

19:03.840 --> 19:07.520
adorably pathetic little gesture of a tiny man.

19:07.520 --> 19:13.200
The whale gets desperate and the doctor pulls out their trump card, some Ipecac, which will

19:13.200 --> 19:14.520
induce vomiting.

19:14.520 --> 19:18.520
By vomiting up that stomach acid, it would burn Kemp to death.

19:18.520 --> 19:23.200
Kemp thinks quickly and decides to go back into the stomach, this time with a plan.

19:23.200 --> 19:26.640
He heads towards the ulcer, remember that thing from a little earlier?

19:26.640 --> 19:31.240
He starts tearing at it, getting it to start bleeding, and for some reason this attracts

19:31.240 --> 19:32.800
all the robotic dust mites.

19:32.800 --> 19:37.880
I don't know how Kemp knew this would happen, or why it happens at all, but it does.

19:37.880 --> 19:41.480
Here's a fun fact, dust mites don't drink blood.

19:41.480 --> 19:46.040
Maybe the robotic ones are different, but I'm not sure why anyone would program them

19:46.040 --> 19:51.360
to drink human blood, that seems like a weird thing to program a robot to do.

19:51.360 --> 19:53.600
But now let's think about this plan for a moment.

19:53.600 --> 19:58.120
When it begins, the doctor has already given the whale the Ipecac, and according to Kemp,

19:58.120 --> 20:01.080
he has seconds to pull all of this off.

20:01.080 --> 20:06.400
Just a few seconds now before the geyser of acidic vomit comes up, finishing me.

20:06.400 --> 20:11.240
I rub my right leg, what's left of it, and look down through the ring.

20:11.240 --> 20:16.600
Ipecac is washing through the stomach, and mechanical mites are swimming around in it.

20:16.600 --> 20:23.000
Soon they'll be joining me, along with the acid, unless I join the bursts.

20:23.000 --> 20:27.040
The ulcer, it's the only chance.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.840
Kemp somehow knew to use the robotic dust mites to attack the ulcer.

20:30.840 --> 20:36.020
He somehow knew the doctor would then, on the spot, decide to cut open the whale to

20:36.020 --> 20:40.600
get it out, and in that whole mess, Kemp would jump to freedom.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.740
And that's the genius plan that Kemp just came up with on the spot.

20:44.740 --> 20:50.560
And what about that impending vomit after the whale swallows the Ipecac?

20:50.560 --> 20:56.360
I think Ben just kind of forgot about it, because it's never mentioned.

20:56.360 --> 21:00.040
Kemp was in the stomach the whole time, so it would have killed him.

21:00.040 --> 21:03.560
The impending vomit acid just never arrives.

21:03.560 --> 21:09.560
Also, it's really impressive that Kemp pulls off this entire plan with one leg.

21:09.560 --> 21:12.320
That's one heck of a plan coming together.

21:12.320 --> 21:16.440
The story ends with the whale demanding that the doctor kill Kemp, but Jensen decides to

21:16.440 --> 21:18.960
murder the doctor instead to save his friend.

21:18.960 --> 21:24.040
The whale, who at no point vomits in this story, presumably bleeds out because he has

21:24.040 --> 21:26.800
a giant hole in his stomach.

21:26.800 --> 21:30.720
So with the story now told, have you figured out the subtext?

21:30.720 --> 21:35.720
It's really tough, because even when you know and you can see the connections more clearly,

21:35.720 --> 21:37.440
it still doesn't make any sense.

21:37.440 --> 21:40.800
I'm going to read this revealing passage for you now.

21:40.800 --> 21:45.700
This is a conversation the whale has with Jensen after he decides to murder Kemp.

21:45.700 --> 21:48.980
Kemp is listening to this conversation from inside the stomach.

21:48.980 --> 21:54.780
Jensen swallows, I can hear it all the way across the room, not even through the beacon.

21:54.780 --> 21:59.860
Sir, he says, that would be pure murder.

21:59.860 --> 22:06.500
Yes, says the whale, but it's my body, and what's in it is my purview.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.500
That's the law.

22:07.500 --> 22:12.220
Look it up, but look it up after you call the doctor.

22:12.220 --> 22:15.260
This story is about abortion.

22:15.260 --> 22:18.700
Yeah, that basically gives it all away, huh?

22:18.700 --> 22:24.260
So now do we talk about how a living being grows inside a person, or there's a caesarean

22:24.260 --> 22:30.120
operation, or a doctor is being called upon to be complicit in murder?

22:30.120 --> 22:35.460
Sometimes a story's narrative is so bad, so clumsy, and falls so hard on its face that

22:35.460 --> 22:40.740
the only fitting criticism is to tell everybody what happens in it.

22:40.740 --> 22:43.860
So let's move on to the next story.

22:43.860 --> 22:48.860
Utopia is the shortest of the three stories, and easily the worst one, mostly because it's

22:48.860 --> 22:54.180
not really a story, just a drab portrait of what Ben believes a socialist utopia would

22:54.180 --> 22:55.420
look like.

22:55.420 --> 23:00.600
One where everyone lives the same life, with every part of it decided for them by the government.

23:00.600 --> 23:06.100
Our hero is a nameless protagonist who lives in this sheltered society trapped in a giant

23:06.100 --> 23:08.500
bubble cut off from the rest of the world.

23:08.500 --> 23:13.340
He goes about his drab life working at some random factory where his job is turning to

23:13.340 --> 23:15.180
spigot on and off.

23:15.180 --> 23:20.220
On Wednesdays he plays cards with some strangers, Tuesdays he hooks up with a random woman,

23:20.220 --> 23:23.340
and on Thursdays he goes out and looks at the stars.

23:23.340 --> 23:28.540
Ben gives us a world where there are no relationships, not romantic ones, and not even friendships.

23:28.540 --> 23:33.020
This socialist utopia means giving up all those things as people come and go out of

23:33.020 --> 23:36.060
your life and no meaningful connection is ever made.

23:36.060 --> 23:42.180
On one of his stargazing nights, our protagonist looks up at the sky and notices a comet streaking

23:42.180 --> 23:43.180
through the night.

23:43.180 --> 23:47.540
It happens to be Haley's comet, which passes by every 75 years, although this only gets

23:47.540 --> 23:49.420
revealed a little bit later on.

23:49.420 --> 23:53.900
Somehow, seeing this comet awaken something in our protagonist.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.660
Here's how the book describes it.

23:55.660 --> 23:59.420
And suddenly, his hazy dream burst into consciousness.

23:59.420 --> 24:04.700
He found himself standing, tears rolling down his face, gazing up at the sky, a terrible

24:04.700 --> 24:10.740
longing filled him, a feeling of dread and of hope, a new feeling, an old feeling.

24:10.740 --> 24:14.820
The star tore the night apart, leaving day falling behind it.

24:14.820 --> 24:19.780
When he looked around him, he saw thousands of eyes and thousands of faces staring at

24:19.780 --> 24:21.780
him, blankly.

24:21.780 --> 24:23.940
The star hit the horizon.

24:23.940 --> 24:26.700
He turned and ran.

24:26.700 --> 24:29.060
Every line is so breathless in Ben's writing.

24:29.060 --> 24:33.980
It's like he imagines every story to be utterly captivating and demands the reader being thralled

24:33.980 --> 24:35.500
along with him.

24:35.500 --> 24:41.580
This reader was annoyed by the tiny sentences that never offered anything of depth or value.

24:41.580 --> 24:47.260
There are just these tiny little descriptions of plot points, only filled with the barest,

24:47.260 --> 24:51.740
scantest of details that seem completely perfunctory.

24:51.740 --> 24:54.020
And what exactly is happening in this moment?

24:54.020 --> 24:57.660
A transformation, yes, but how and why?

24:57.660 --> 25:00.700
And what exactly is changing here?

25:00.700 --> 25:03.420
Let's see if the story will answer that for us.

25:03.420 --> 25:07.700
The protagonist's dash is immediately noticed by the Ministry of Protection.

25:07.700 --> 25:11.660
There are a lot of ministries in this book, but this is the only one that actually does

25:11.660 --> 25:12.660
anything.

25:12.660 --> 25:15.820
Several enforcers are dispatched to chase after the protagonist.

25:15.820 --> 25:20.580
They try using this thing called the pulse, which is some kind of weapon that uses sound

25:20.580 --> 25:22.220
to incapacitate people.

25:22.220 --> 25:25.940
When they try using it on our protagonist, this happens.

25:25.940 --> 25:28.220
Behind him, the pulse crescendoed.

25:28.220 --> 25:33.140
He could feel the hair on his arm stand on end, his knees begin to buckle.

25:33.140 --> 25:38.700
Soon, he knew, his legs would give out, his head fry from the pulse.

25:38.700 --> 25:43.620
Yes, his head fry from the pulse, good copy editing there, by the way.

25:43.620 --> 25:45.120
But it didn't.

25:45.120 --> 25:48.800
The enforcer's eyes widened in shock as the pod approached.

25:48.800 --> 25:54.300
He was well within range of the pulse now, yet nothing was happening, nothing.

25:54.300 --> 25:59.140
Another enforcement pod opened up with the pulse, full bore, nothing.

25:59.140 --> 26:01.420
A smile creased his worn face.

26:01.420 --> 26:04.140
He slowed to a jog, then a walk.

26:04.140 --> 26:09.420
Then, finally, he stopped dead and turned around, facing his pursuers.

26:09.420 --> 26:15.260
As he did, the pods backed away, as though called away by some higher power.

26:15.260 --> 26:17.980
He turned again and ran toward the mountain.

26:17.980 --> 26:23.980
I have no idea why this pulse, which we've not heard about until now, doesn't work.

26:23.980 --> 26:25.180
It just doesn't.

26:25.180 --> 26:27.360
And this is never explained in the story.

26:27.360 --> 26:30.740
And this mountain location is mentioned for the first time right here.

26:30.740 --> 26:35.340
I don't know why the protagonist knows to just run towards it, but that's what's happening.

26:35.340 --> 26:39.300
What's even funnier is that Ben doesn't even know how his protagonist knows about

26:39.300 --> 26:40.300
the mountain.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.780
He didn't know how he knew about the mountain.

26:42.780 --> 26:45.440
The Ministry of Environment never talked about it.

26:45.440 --> 26:49.060
Nobody knew the words mountain or valley.

26:49.060 --> 26:52.940
He couldn't even see the mountain thanks to the bubble, the protective climate change,

26:52.940 --> 27:00.020
the artificial environment that made all land even and flat, fruitful and evenly graded.

27:00.020 --> 27:02.980
Nobody he knew had ever been outside the bubble.

27:02.980 --> 27:07.220
The protagonist runs towards the mountain, but is stopped by the dome of his enclosure.

27:07.220 --> 27:11.540
Eventually, for unnamed reasons, the doorway is opened and the protagonist is allowed to

27:11.540 --> 27:12.880
approach the mountain.

27:12.880 --> 27:18.020
As he approaches, the protagonist sees a sign that reads, The Creed of Ignorance.

27:18.020 --> 27:22.100
This for the unfamiliar is how Winston Churchill referred to socialism.

27:22.100 --> 27:27.580
The full quote reads, socialism is the philosophy of failure, the creed of ignorance and the

27:27.580 --> 27:29.420
gospel of envy.

27:29.420 --> 27:33.540
Why would socialists put up part of a quote that makes them sound like the bad guys?

27:33.540 --> 27:36.100
And that quote basically encapsulates this story.

27:36.100 --> 27:39.420
People living in this socialist utopia all think they're happy, but they're actually

27:39.420 --> 27:44.260
under a mass delusion that our nameless protagonist has broken out of, somehow.

27:44.260 --> 27:46.180
Let's read on and see if we get an answer to that.

27:46.180 --> 27:48.180
He probably guessed we aren't though, right?

27:48.180 --> 27:50.020
Yeah, he probably figured that out.

27:50.020 --> 27:54.020
A chamber inside the mountain houses an old man and his many books.

27:54.020 --> 27:58.220
He's bedridden and just kind of lame there when our protagonist finds him, and the two

27:58.220 --> 28:00.260
have a weighty conversation.

28:00.260 --> 28:03.940
Here's the closest we get to understanding what sent our protagonist on his journey.

28:03.940 --> 28:04.940
Halley's Comet.

28:04.940 --> 28:07.980
I know you don't know what that is, never mind about that.

28:07.980 --> 28:11.340
Suffice it to say that it shows up once every 75 years.

28:11.340 --> 28:14.980
Your father and mother must have seen it at some point.

28:14.980 --> 28:16.700
At that he spoke.

28:16.700 --> 28:19.140
I never knew my father and mother.

28:19.140 --> 28:21.140
But you remember the comment.

28:21.140 --> 28:23.820
I don't know what I remember.

28:23.820 --> 28:25.240
And then they move on.

28:25.240 --> 28:31.540
If you want answers to nonsensical plot twists, or in this case, the entire premise, Ben Shapiro

28:31.540 --> 28:33.260
isn't the writer for you.

28:33.260 --> 28:37.620
But maybe I'm being nitpicky, it might not matter what brought us to this point.

28:37.620 --> 28:42.120
We have a social outcast from a socialist society who's confronting a man revealed

28:42.120 --> 28:44.480
to be one of that society's architects.

28:44.480 --> 28:49.020
This is the moment this was all building to, so maybe it'll pay off and of course it's

28:49.020 --> 28:51.720
not going to pay off, but let's find out what happens.

28:51.720 --> 28:56.200
In the minds of the socialist, according to the story, the problem is diversity.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.740
The differences between people create strife and discord.

28:59.740 --> 29:01.460
Let's let the old man explain it.

29:01.460 --> 29:07.100
For no matter what measures government tried, inequality remained, redistribution of resources

29:07.100 --> 29:08.860
merely masked the problem.

29:08.860 --> 29:14.580
Laws directed toward helping particular groups often ended with them being strangely disadvantaged.

29:14.580 --> 29:17.900
Different abilities bred different values, different belief systems.

29:17.900 --> 29:20.820
Those values and systems caused conflict.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.800
We tried everything to solve it.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.180
We tried education.

29:24.180 --> 29:28.460
We tried genetic treatments designed to raise the average intelligence.

29:28.460 --> 29:32.100
But each IQ point meant a massive difference in outcome.

29:32.100 --> 29:34.340
There's something very sinister happening here.

29:34.340 --> 29:37.180
And I don't just mean the swipe at the welfare state.

29:37.180 --> 29:41.860
What Ben is presenting to us is a reading of diversity amongst cultures as the product

29:41.860 --> 29:43.660
of genetic differences.

29:43.660 --> 29:47.740
That is to say, the reason some societies differ from others, and more importantly,

29:47.740 --> 29:53.000
why some societies perform better than others, is because of their genes.

29:53.000 --> 29:59.500
This story is resting very heavily on the idea that some people, or in this case, some

29:59.500 --> 30:04.020
groups of people, are simply born better than others.

30:04.020 --> 30:10.220
And he pulls it out to mean that this is a product of our genes, and is completely inescapable,

30:10.220 --> 30:12.220
regardless of how we engineer society.

30:12.220 --> 30:17.180
It completely disregards history, environments, both physical and social.

30:17.180 --> 30:22.540
If some cultures do better than others, ultimately, it can only be explained because their people

30:22.540 --> 30:24.740
are genetically superior.

30:24.740 --> 30:28.460
If we don't want to talk about culture, we can also talk about class.

30:28.460 --> 30:33.300
Rich people are rich because they have superior genes compared to poor people.

30:33.300 --> 30:35.860
They were simply born to be better.

30:35.860 --> 30:40.220
In this story, because the old man specifically refers to breeding programs that needed to

30:40.220 --> 30:46.300
be used to filter out the differences between people, it's literally talking about eugenics.

30:46.300 --> 30:50.500
The line towards race realism here is pretty direct.

30:50.500 --> 30:54.740
For those who don't know, race realism is a pseudoscience that tries to justify racism

30:54.740 --> 30:59.940
through a misunderstanding of genetics and overemphasis on arbitrary physical characteristics.

30:59.940 --> 31:04.340
I don't want to get too sidetracked here, but if you want to know why this is nonsense,

31:04.340 --> 31:07.460
I've included a few links in the description below.

31:07.460 --> 31:12.560
It's all nonsense, and it's used to explain away some of history's worst crimes.

31:12.560 --> 31:16.020
The old man describes his ideals.

31:16.020 --> 31:17.900
Equality is the key.

31:17.900 --> 31:19.840
Equality cannot be achieved in excellence.

31:19.840 --> 31:22.900
It can only be achieved in mediocrity.

31:22.900 --> 31:25.700
And we have achieved it within the bubble.

31:25.700 --> 31:26.900
All are equal.

31:26.900 --> 31:27.900
All want nothing.

31:27.900 --> 31:28.900
Aspire to nothing.

31:28.900 --> 31:29.900
It is perfect.

31:29.900 --> 31:31.540
It is stasis.

31:31.540 --> 31:33.100
It took generations.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.460
Three generations to breed out the intelligent, to select out the unique.

31:36.460 --> 31:40.020
We have more disease now, but we have no unhappiness.

31:40.020 --> 31:43.420
More poverty now, but shared by all.

31:43.420 --> 31:47.500
This operation to create equality didn't take with our protagonist, though.

31:47.500 --> 31:52.260
When the old man tells him happiness is a myth, then nothing can make man happy because

31:52.260 --> 31:57.260
of our internal desires to do better, and eventually failing, becoming unhappy, the

31:57.260 --> 32:01.500
protagonist responds, no, he said.

32:01.500 --> 32:04.460
It is happiness to be so unhappy.

32:04.460 --> 32:09.420
What he's saying so clumsily is the pursuit of greatness, even if it falls short, is what

32:09.420 --> 32:10.780
makes people happy.

32:10.780 --> 32:14.100
Maybe because we fall short and always have something to strive towards.

32:14.100 --> 32:18.620
Although I'm putting words in his mouth a little here, especially with that last sentence.

32:18.620 --> 32:22.700
Because instead of getting more detail, but what I suspect is the whole point of the story,

32:22.700 --> 32:25.260
we get a cringy action scene instead.

32:25.260 --> 32:29.180
Two enforcers have showed up to the mountain to take our protagonist away.

32:29.180 --> 32:34.740
The old man has decided an independent man like our protagonist is trouble.

32:34.740 --> 32:37.140
Here's one really bad part.

32:37.140 --> 32:40.220
It's describing the actions of our protagonist in this scene.

32:40.220 --> 32:43.540
He leapt to the bookcase, his hand gripped a volume.

32:43.540 --> 32:48.060
The penta took, it said, and he pulled it from the bookcase.

32:48.060 --> 32:50.160
The withered man was screaming now.

32:50.160 --> 32:52.480
In anger or despair, he could not tell.

32:52.480 --> 32:57.060
He swung the heavy volume, metal edged at the other enforcer, who was moving towards

32:57.060 --> 32:59.540
him with a slow certitude.

32:59.540 --> 33:04.740
The book crunched into the enforcer's skull, and he toppled to the floor with a crash.

33:04.740 --> 33:09.700
For the unfamiliar, the penta took are the first five books on the Old Testament.

33:09.700 --> 33:15.460
Yeah, this story literally has someone being beaten to death with a holy book.

33:15.460 --> 33:18.620
Subtle, this story is not.

33:18.620 --> 33:22.740
The protagonist confronts the old man, accusing him of ruining mankind's potential, and then

33:22.740 --> 33:25.540
he uses a pillow to smother the old man's scene.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.020
You protected us from our humanity.

33:28.020 --> 33:32.580
From our possibility, may God, the word jumped again to his mouth.

33:32.580 --> 33:34.860
May God forgive you.

33:34.860 --> 33:39.380
In one fell swoop, our protagonist has found God and killed his oppressor.

33:39.380 --> 33:43.260
And the story ends with him wandering off into the wilderness to see if there are other

33:43.260 --> 33:46.340
painfully contrived morality tales he can appear in.

33:46.340 --> 33:50.780
One of the biggest problems this story has is that there's no internal logic to the

33:50.780 --> 33:51.780
plot.

33:51.780 --> 33:54.180
The main character realizes something somehow.

33:54.180 --> 33:58.340
He is pursued until he isn't, and then he is again.

33:58.340 --> 34:01.260
And he knows about places before knowing about them.

34:01.260 --> 34:05.140
That last part in particular is a problem, since so much of this story is dedicated to

34:05.140 --> 34:07.300
describing the main character's ignorance.

34:07.300 --> 34:10.620
He doesn't know what ants are, he's never seen books, he doesn't know what mountains

34:10.620 --> 34:15.980
are, he doesn't know what a comet is, but he knows the mountain when he needs to, and

34:15.980 --> 34:19.740
he knows anything he needs to know when the plot requires him to.

34:19.740 --> 34:25.740
When he realizes that his life is unfulfilling and makes him unhappy, the story is trying

34:25.740 --> 34:30.780
to convey this inner truth as if the knowledge of wanting more out of life is some kind of

34:30.780 --> 34:34.060
natural impulse that can't be extinguished, only hidden.

34:34.060 --> 34:38.700
It's not a terrible point, but the problem is here, in the story of free will and not

34:38.700 --> 34:43.340
having life dictated to you by the government, ironically makes its protagonist seem like

34:43.340 --> 34:47.100
a marionette dancing on its author's strings.

34:47.100 --> 34:53.580
How can this be a story of free will and self-determination when it's so painfully contrived and forced?

34:53.580 --> 34:57.980
This is how terrible writing can ultimately undermine any point an author is trying to

34:57.980 --> 34:58.980
make.

34:58.980 --> 35:03.460
The worldview here is ultimately one built on selfishness and tribalism.

35:03.460 --> 35:08.260
It not only seems to be fine with one group of people having a higher concentration of

35:08.260 --> 35:13.580
wealth to the detriment of others, it also says that they are inherently worthy of that

35:13.580 --> 35:15.500
higher position in society.

35:15.500 --> 35:21.180
Think back to the talk about diversity creating strife because some groups have superior genes.

35:21.180 --> 35:23.860
This is presented as the natural order.

35:23.860 --> 35:27.620
In this story's world, socialists are trying to upset a natural order where the superior

35:27.620 --> 35:31.420
people make more money and the inferior ones live in squalor.

35:31.420 --> 35:36.060
It's a full-throated defense of capitalism, using racist pseudoscience as an excuse for

35:36.060 --> 35:38.580
not having to care about the poor.

35:38.580 --> 35:41.060
And it's a pretty terrible short story too.

35:41.060 --> 35:46.220
Part of me wants to look back and have some sort of grand conclusion now that I've read

35:46.220 --> 35:52.420
the complete works of Ben Shapiro's fiction, but a bigger part of me would like to simply

35:52.420 --> 35:56.500
fade away and never think about this dark period in my life.

35:56.500 --> 36:01.500
Although if he publishes another book, I will definitely, definitely be reading it.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.700
Not buying it, but definitely reading it.

36:04.700 --> 36:05.700
Whew.

36:05.700 --> 36:10.740
So yeah, another Ben Shapiro literature adventure for all of you.

36:10.740 --> 36:16.940
For those wondering, I did not purchase this short story collection and I very much recommend

36:16.940 --> 36:19.300
against doing that.

36:19.300 --> 36:22.740
It's very bad and you would be giving a bad man money.

36:22.740 --> 36:23.740
Don't do it.

36:23.740 --> 36:27.420
Not all of my videos are going to be about terrible, conservative fiction in the future.

36:27.420 --> 36:31.540
I might do a few now and then if anything catches my eye.

36:31.540 --> 36:37.860
The names you see on the screen are my lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely patrons.

36:37.860 --> 36:42.220
If you've enjoyed my videos, please consider making a monthly donation if it's within

36:42.220 --> 36:43.220
your memes.

36:43.220 --> 36:45.220
It really does help a lot.

36:45.220 --> 36:51.180
I know these videos don't look like it, but they do actually cost time and money to produce.

36:51.180 --> 36:56.140
So anyone who would like to contribute to helping me make more videos, I very much

36:56.140 --> 36:57.380
am grateful for that support.

36:57.380 --> 37:03.100
A special shout out to my patron who decided to donate $5.69.

37:03.100 --> 37:04.540
Hell yeah.

37:04.540 --> 37:06.880
That's the sex number.

37:06.880 --> 37:13.020
If you enjoy this video or this channel, definitely like, comment, and subscribe.

37:13.020 --> 37:14.780
Also hit the little bell to get reminders.

37:14.780 --> 37:18.900
You can follow me on Twitter, ask me a question on Curious Cat.

37:18.900 --> 37:19.900
Thank you.

37:19.900 --> 37:21.500
Thank you so much for watching.
