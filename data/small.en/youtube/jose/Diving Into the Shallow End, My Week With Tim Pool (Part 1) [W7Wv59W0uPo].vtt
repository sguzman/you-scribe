00:00.000 --> 00:03.500
This was the longest week of my life.

00:11.600 --> 00:16.320
Tim Poole is a person with a YouTube channel. Two channels, actually.

00:16.320 --> 00:20.400
He produces about six videos daily where he comments on the news of the day.

00:20.400 --> 00:26.640
He is not a popular guy on the left. To hear him tell it, it's because the left has lost its mind.

00:27.120 --> 00:31.120
While I've watched a few of his videos in the past, and even made a response to one of them,

00:31.120 --> 00:35.280
I wanted to see what a week-long trek through the world of his content would produce.

00:35.280 --> 00:40.480
This video covers all the video content created by Tim Poole from December 15th

00:40.480 --> 00:44.800
to December 21st in 2019. Let's dive right in.

00:45.600 --> 00:56.480
By far, the biggest story of that week in the US political world was the vote in Congress

00:56.480 --> 01:02.720
to impeach President Donald Trump. Of the 42 videos Tim produced, 11 were about impeachment

01:02.720 --> 01:08.800
in one way or another. They had titles such as Democrat Slammed by protest as impeachment

01:08.800 --> 01:17.040
support collapses. Majority now oppose impeachment. Impeachment backfire gets worse as Trump now

01:17.040 --> 01:24.160
defeats every 2020 Democrat in major polling. Democrats have not impeached Trump. Democrats

01:24.160 --> 01:30.400
own witness undermines Pelosi's strategy. Gee, I wonder why people would think this guy is right-wing.

01:31.120 --> 01:35.840
These, obviously, clickbait titles are how Tim advertises his political videos.

01:35.840 --> 01:41.040
The Democrats are consistently on the verge of collapse and the Republicans are on an endless

01:41.040 --> 01:45.840
winning streak. But to hear Tim tell it, he's actually trying to help the Democrats by offering

01:45.840 --> 01:51.440
honest criticism. The only problem is he has no idea what he's talking about. Tim has an

01:51.440 --> 01:56.320
interesting take on the Trump impeachment proceedings. He believes it's a top-to-bottom

01:56.320 --> 02:02.080
farce. To Tim, Trump not only has done nothing wrong, but the Democrats have been lawless in

02:02.080 --> 02:06.960
pursuing him, and the subject of the investigation should be Joe Biden. One of the annoying things

02:06.960 --> 02:12.080
about watching his videos is how rarely he explains why he believes the things he believes.

02:12.080 --> 02:17.360
Of the 11 impeachment videos, only two really outline his case. I suppose he went into detail

02:17.360 --> 02:21.760
in previous videos, which would be fine if he told his viewers where they could get more information,

02:21.760 --> 02:26.320
like say a link to relevant videos. Instead, his channel is set up so that you have to have some

02:26.320 --> 02:30.480
knowledge of right-wing narratives to believe anything that he's saying, or even to really

02:30.480 --> 02:36.800
follow it. Not that it would help, because he's very wrong on impeachment. To be fair, Tim doesn't

02:36.800 --> 02:41.600
want us to take his legal expertise on the matter, though. Here's an example of Tim trying to use an

02:41.600 --> 02:48.080
expert to cite the claim that impeachment is baseless. Congress is claiming Trump obstructed

02:48.080 --> 02:55.520
Congress by rejecting these subpoenas. Trump's argument is that he has executive privilege,

02:55.520 --> 03:00.960
this information, and he's under no obligation to turn it over without judicial review.

03:02.160 --> 03:07.840
And it sounds like he's right. Why does Alan Dershowitz have authority on this?

03:08.800 --> 03:12.000
Famous Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden supporter Alan Dershowitz says,

03:12.640 --> 03:19.120
so Tim's position relies not on the merit of the argument, but on his status as a Clinton and Biden

03:19.120 --> 03:24.240
supporter. He's using Dershowitz's identity to support his claim, ignoring the many people who

03:24.320 --> 03:27.840
disagree with him. For example, one of Dershowitz's own students.

03:27.840 --> 03:32.960
Abusive power was rejected, and terms like that, as explicit grounds for impeachment.

03:32.960 --> 03:37.600
No, that's not true, Alan. Look, that's not, abusive power was not rejected.

03:37.600 --> 03:41.680
Yes, there were. There was, well, the word maladministration is rejected explicitly.

03:41.680 --> 03:44.640
Maladministration is a totally different thing.

03:44.640 --> 03:48.720
It's also worth noting that Dershowitz is currently advising the Trump administration

03:48.720 --> 03:52.480
on impeachment proceedings, but that's only looking at the second article of impeachment,

03:52.480 --> 03:57.200
obstruction of Congress, during the impeachment process. Tim's dismissal of the first article

03:57.200 --> 04:02.080
is even more laughable. For those unfamiliar, the short version of the obstruction of power

04:02.080 --> 04:06.800
claim is that President Trump withheld aid to Ukraine that had been appropriated by Congress

04:06.800 --> 04:11.840
to pressure the president of Ukraine to either investigate or announce an investigation into Joe

04:11.840 --> 04:18.960
Biden and his son Hunter, and also to investigate Ukraine's supposed influence on the 2016 election.

04:18.960 --> 04:24.480
Tim finds these allegations absurd. One of the claims he seriously makes is that in no way was

04:24.480 --> 04:29.040
Donald Trump worried about Joe Biden. Why would Trump be scared of Biden of all people? And Biden

04:29.040 --> 04:34.640
even won the nomination yet. It's a lie. Articles published as far back in March of this year,

04:34.640 --> 04:39.200
a few months before Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine, suggest that Trump was

04:39.200 --> 04:43.760
definitely worried about Biden. While Biden certainly isn't my favorite Democrat in the

04:43.760 --> 04:48.480
field, he's undeniably the front-runner, and has been for as long as he's been in the Democratic

04:48.480 --> 04:53.520
primary. To say Trump is not concerned about Biden or that he doesn't consider him a political

04:53.520 --> 04:59.040
rival is to be willfully ignorant. Tim then tries to describe Trump's state of mind on why he

04:59.040 --> 05:04.400
withheld the money. I think for one, Trump doesn't want to give U.S. money to foreign countries. I

05:04.400 --> 05:08.240
think that's a fact. He's withholding aid from like Lebanon or other countries. I don't think

05:08.240 --> 05:13.920
Ukraine is special. So this is something Trump does all the time, but Democrats are arbitrarily

05:13.920 --> 05:18.560
choosing this case, even though this is a specific type of military aid that Congress

05:18.560 --> 05:22.400
voted on giving to Ukraine. But even that isn't the real reason Trump is doing this.

05:22.400 --> 05:25.200
Let's listen to Tim tell us the real reason Trump is doing this.

05:43.920 --> 05:45.840
Because he's upset about this.

05:45.840 --> 05:50.960
Tim believes Trump triggered the investigation as a form of retribution for all the lies the media

05:50.960 --> 05:55.360
and the Democrats have supposedly been throwing at him. And Tim doesn't think that using the

05:55.360 --> 05:59.840
office of the president and U.S. foreign policy to go after your political rivals is an abuse of

05:59.840 --> 06:04.720
power. Of course, that's also not the real reason. Let's hear Tim give us the real reason once again,

06:04.720 --> 06:09.040
and this time it's Trump isn't doing it out of anger, but it's because he really cares about

06:09.120 --> 06:14.560
America. Trump said, do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot.

06:14.560 --> 06:19.280
He was clearly talking about us as America. And if you want to argue, you got to argue

06:19.280 --> 06:22.560
from the facts, but they don't do that. They say Trump demanded a favor. Trump said,

06:22.560 --> 06:26.480
I want to favor. He never said that. So they keep going up. They say it's not disputed,

06:26.480 --> 06:31.360
but they've never presented any evidence that Trump's frame of mind in that conversation had

06:31.360 --> 06:35.360
anything to do with Biden. As a quick aside, Biden was mentioned specifically in the conversation,

06:35.360 --> 06:40.400
which I believe proves Trump was thinking about him to some degree. But the important point is

06:40.400 --> 06:45.520
none of what Tim is saying holds together. Trump didn't care about Biden during this conversation,

06:45.520 --> 06:49.600
but he did mention him by name as a person to be investigated. Trump withheld the money

06:49.600 --> 06:53.600
as part of standard policy, but Tim also acknowledges it was a partisan attack on

06:53.600 --> 06:58.000
political rivals. But also, it wasn't about that. It was about his love of country.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.760
Perhaps there's some nuance here I'm missing, but after watching these videos, I'm not sure

07:01.760 --> 07:07.440
Tim knows what he thinks about this. The only constant in all of these videos is the narrative

07:07.440 --> 07:12.480
that Trump needs to be considered innocent, regardless of the justifications. This is how

07:12.480 --> 07:16.240
narrative is used to reshape the facts. You can talk about what's happening in the news,

07:16.240 --> 07:20.000
but the facts are being distorted to reinforce the narrative that Trump did nothing wrong.

07:20.000 --> 07:24.000
Contradictions don't matter, and neither do objective facts, just the narrative.

07:24.720 --> 07:29.280
Here's another example of how Tim misrepresents reality to push a Trump innocence narrative.

07:29.280 --> 07:33.680
Tim really wants to hammer home the idea that Trump hasn't committed any statutory crimes,

07:33.680 --> 07:38.240
so this whole impeachment process doesn't meet the standards of high crimes and misdemeanors.

07:39.120 --> 07:42.960
All of the other presidents who actually faced impeachment were being charged with statutory

07:42.960 --> 07:50.160
crimes. Trump is the first president to face no statutory crime. And about 40 seconds before that,

07:50.160 --> 07:55.120
he asserts something I want us to remember. He would rightly defer to the expert opinion of

07:55.200 --> 07:59.920
an academic on the constitution over a journalist. If you're an academic and you're an expert on

07:59.920 --> 08:04.480
the constitution and you say Trump was unimpeached, I defer to you over the journalist. If you think

08:04.480 --> 08:09.280
Trump should be impeached on these issues, I will still defer to you over the journalists.

08:09.280 --> 08:13.440
He's completely right when he says this, but he's also completely wrong when he says the phrase

08:13.440 --> 08:18.720
high crimes and misdemeanors means that statutory crimes must be a part of the impeachment process.

08:18.720 --> 08:24.160
In an article for The Atlantic, Frank O. Bowman III, a professor at the University of Missouri

08:24.160 --> 08:28.080
School of Law who literally wrote a book on the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors,

08:28.080 --> 08:33.200
goes into detail about the origin of the phrase and how it most certainly applies to abuse of power,

08:33.200 --> 08:37.680
and doesn't require any statutory crimes to have been committed. Here are a few excerpts from that

08:37.680 --> 08:43.280
article that provide historical context. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton made the

08:43.280 --> 08:48.960
larger point that impeachment is directed at political offenses that proceed from the abuse

08:48.960 --> 08:54.240
or violation of some public trust. He provides a number of examples of people being impeached

08:54.240 --> 08:58.880
without having committed a crime, and he offers a famous hypothetical and one of his own to

08:58.880 --> 09:05.600
illustrate the subject even further. Suppose, he imagined, that in 1861, when secession fever broke

09:05.600 --> 09:11.840
out, the president had not been Abraham Lincoln but a man who, whether moved by fear or an honest

09:11.840 --> 09:16.640
but perverted political theory, refused to mobilize the union against the rebellion.

09:16.640 --> 09:21.040
Would we say that the only remedy in such a case was to allow dissolution of the country because

09:21.040 --> 09:26.720
the president's inaction was no crime? Or suppose to bring the case still closer to home,

09:26.720 --> 09:31.440
a president were to subordinate himself and the interests of his own country to a foreign power

09:31.440 --> 09:36.160
because he or his family could make money by doing so, or because the foreign country agreed

09:36.160 --> 09:40.720
to help him secure a re-election. Does anyone seriously suggest that the question of whether

09:40.720 --> 09:47.280
such behavior is impeachable turns on the niceties of ethics rules or campaign finance laws?

09:47.280 --> 09:51.680
So why does Tim continue on with this obviously wrong narrative of impeachment having no merit

09:51.680 --> 09:56.160
because no statutory crimes have been leveled against President Trump? It's because it supports

09:56.160 --> 10:00.880
the narrative he loves so dearly, and that's that the Democrats are not only insane, but their

10:00.880 --> 10:06.800
supporters are complete fools. Tim, apparently, can't understand why the Democrats are impeaching

10:06.800 --> 10:11.280
Trump. Maybe they're sitting there being like, Trump, if Trump's going to get reelected, he needs

10:11.280 --> 10:15.680
a good villain, so they're all going to pretend to be it. Obviously I'm joking, but I can't imagine

10:15.680 --> 10:19.520
why else they would be doing this. But then he figures out the Democrats are actually on a

10:19.520 --> 10:27.280
suicide mission. Rocking a hard place? Whatever. Impeachment. This is the Democrats' final salvo.

10:27.280 --> 10:33.840
It's their kamikaze. They've lost, they know it, and it's all they have left. And then he finally

10:33.840 --> 10:39.520
lands on what is quite possibly the most ridiculous explanation as to why Democrats

10:39.520 --> 10:43.680
are impeaching Trump. I think the reality is the Democrats know their constituents,

10:44.400 --> 10:49.680
these these resistance types are not very smart or are lacking information. They're ignorant.

10:49.680 --> 10:55.600
I'm not trying to be mean, but it's true. Tim Poole thinks that the Democrats are trying to

10:55.600 --> 11:02.000
fool their base into thinking Trump has been removed from office. In what world does this

11:02.000 --> 11:08.000
make any sense? Does he think the Democratic voters are so stupid that they won't notice Trump

11:08.000 --> 11:13.120
is still in office between now and the election? Tim's evidence for this outrageous claim is

11:13.120 --> 11:18.080
provided in a different video because he's very bad at what he does and doesn't evidence claims

11:18.080 --> 11:22.720
when he first makes them. Liberals on Twitter think impeachment means Trump is getting kicked

11:22.720 --> 11:27.040
out of office. His evidence is random people on Twitter. I don't think that really meets the

11:27.040 --> 11:31.760
standard of a scientific poll and it's not really a demonstration that this is a widespread problem,

11:31.760 --> 11:36.400
but it does meet Tim's standard of cherry-picking facts to buttress a narrative of the left being

11:36.400 --> 11:42.720
made up of people detached from reality. He also has another theory on why Democrats are being so

11:42.720 --> 11:48.240
supposedly self-destructive. Should I believe that she thinks she's actually doing something here?

11:48.240 --> 11:52.320
Because we all know Trump isn't going to be removed from office. So why laugh and smile as

11:52.320 --> 11:57.600
you go to impeach him? Because it feels good? Or is it because you want to watch the world burn?

11:57.600 --> 12:03.840
Rashida Tlaib just wants to see the world burn. She is, in fact, the Joker. But Tim,

12:03.840 --> 12:09.040
in an effort to speak to his fellow liberals, does occasionally offer political advice. And wow,

12:09.040 --> 12:13.680
this may be the worst of his commentary. For instance, here's a slogan he recommended to

12:13.680 --> 12:19.280
Democrats. If the Democrats' whole campaign was Trump's not that bad, we'll be a little bit better,

12:19.280 --> 12:24.400
they would be much, much better off than where they are today with protests erupting at their

12:24.400 --> 12:29.680
town hall meetings. Democrats should run on a vaguely pro-Trump sentiment that they're only

12:29.680 --> 12:34.240
going to do a little bit better? Does he not understand that Donald Trump has never been a

12:34.240 --> 12:38.800
popular president? And how does this appeal to Democratic voters who, generally speaking,

12:38.800 --> 12:44.080
don't like Trump? But that's not the end of his awful advice. Tim repeatedly mentions Democrats

12:44.080 --> 12:49.600
have nothing to offer and need new ideas to sway the public. I think the only conclusion we have

12:49.600 --> 12:54.000
is the Democrats are campaigning on things no one cares about. They're saying nothing,

12:54.000 --> 12:57.920
no one cares what they have to say. Interesting point, and totally true, if you ignore the

12:57.920 --> 13:02.560
Democratic primary, which had been going on this whole week. You know, the primary, where they're

13:02.560 --> 13:07.680
discussing various ideas on healthcare, college tuition plans, climate change strategies,

13:07.680 --> 13:12.800
campaign finance laws, financial regulations, income inequality strategies, and plenty of other

13:12.800 --> 13:17.040
ideas. I'm not sure how someone could think that the Democrats aren't trying to offer anything new

13:17.040 --> 13:21.520
or different, but I know why Tim hasn't heard of any of this stuff. Only seven candidates at the

13:21.520 --> 13:25.600
stage last night. Eh, they go on and name it. I don't care. I didn't watch debate. Speaking

13:25.600 --> 13:29.920
specifically to Bernie, though, Tim thinks it would have been a solid strategy to have supported

13:29.920 --> 13:34.000
Trump's investigation into Biden. Look, if you're gonna ask me, I think Bernie should be,

13:34.000 --> 13:39.120
what should be behind Trump on this one. Think about it. For one, politically, it gets Biden

13:39.120 --> 13:43.280
out of the way. I don't think that's the right reason to do it. That's, you know, political

13:43.280 --> 13:48.960
nonsense. Wow, there are so many reasons not to do this, such as it's wrong on the facts,

13:48.960 --> 13:53.360
it harms your standing within the Democratic Party, and it gives ammo to Bernie's opposition

13:53.360 --> 13:57.840
in the election, which would be pretty accurate when he's teaming up with Republicans to target

13:57.840 --> 14:03.200
Democrats. Tim is also quick to support Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's vote of present,

14:03.200 --> 14:08.560
not citing for or against impeachment. But you may have noticed that Tulsi Gabbard voted present,

14:08.560 --> 14:12.160
and man, I was on the airplane, but I wanted to give a standing ovation to this.

14:12.160 --> 14:16.160
This is the best vote of anybody. Tulsi Gabbard's not running for reelection. She's running for

14:16.160 --> 14:21.120
president. She has to be there for most Americans. This was a move that annoyed both the left and the

14:21.120 --> 14:26.400
right, but he sees it as the right move to make. His undying support of Gabbard, often complimenting

14:26.400 --> 14:32.240
her political skills, is betrayed by the fact that she polls at under 2% in the Democratic primary.

14:32.240 --> 14:37.040
I'm sure Tim would blame the DNC or the media, but Bernie Sanders faces similar challenges,

14:37.040 --> 14:40.880
and he's managed to be one of the frontrunners. That's because people actually like him and his

14:40.880 --> 14:46.880
policies, and based on a recent poll, not many people like Tulsi. But hey, this deeply unpopular

14:46.880 --> 14:51.840
Democrat is an example of someone doing it right in Tim's eyes, so that's the sort of support one

14:51.840 --> 14:57.280
would get for following Tim's strategies on how to run a successful campaign. I believe all these

14:57.280 --> 15:02.880
suggestions from Tim Pool reveal two things. The first is that Tim is genuine. This could be

15:02.880 --> 15:07.840
portrayed as him providing his bona fides to his right-wing audience as being ostensibly someone

15:07.840 --> 15:12.800
on the left, but the reactions and comments tend to be disinterested on how to repair the left and

15:12.800 --> 15:17.440
more interested in destroying it. I think he genuinely believes that these suggestions will

15:17.440 --> 15:21.600
write the Democratic Party and let it have a brighter future in American politics. The second

15:21.600 --> 15:27.360
thing these suggestions reveal is that Tim Pool is completely clueless when it comes to politics.

15:27.360 --> 15:31.600
His ideas betray an appalling ignorance on political maneuvering and public sentiment.

15:31.600 --> 15:36.400
It pretends the Democratic base is non-existent or not worth considering, and it praises strategies

15:36.400 --> 15:42.000
that have been proven to fail. Tim just doesn't know what he's talking about here. Before leaving

15:42.000 --> 15:46.560
his impeachment discussion, I'll highlight one more clip. Here's Tim talking about Donald Trump's

15:46.560 --> 15:52.320
political leanings. Donald Trump, in reality, for those that are actually tracking politics,

15:52.320 --> 15:57.920
is a moderate. He really is. They want to claim he's far right now. Trump's a New York Democrat.

15:57.920 --> 16:01.440
I think the only reason he ran as a Republican is because Democrats would never elect a billionaire.

16:01.440 --> 16:05.360
I don't know how someone could possibly believe this. The man who spent his administration by

16:05.360 --> 16:09.600
trying to undo everything done by President Obama, from the Iran deal to the Paris Climate

16:09.600 --> 16:14.240
Accord to the Affordable Care Act, the man who pushed tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans,

16:14.240 --> 16:19.120
and the man who is appointing conservative judges across the country, is a New York Democrat.

16:19.120 --> 16:24.000
And that's a narrative that, if you can convince someone of, you can convince them of anything.

16:24.000 --> 16:30.160
Donald Trump is supposedly a moderate. So what, in Tim's mind, would a real conservative look like?

16:35.360 --> 16:42.560
Recently, Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks announced a run for Congress in California. Although well

16:42.560 --> 16:47.680
known for being on the left, a number of spurious articles attacking him appeared in the supposedly

16:47.680 --> 16:53.520
left-wing mainstream media. Tim commented on this in his video titled, The Young Turks Cenk Uygur is

16:53.520 --> 16:59.440
getting destroyed by establishment over his animal love endorsement. Now, I really want to stress the

16:59.440 --> 17:04.400
title here. Tim gets very angry about misleading headlines, but what does this one suggest? The

17:04.400 --> 17:09.360
media is a tanking Cenk, yes, but it's only vaguely hinted at being based on falsehood by

17:09.360 --> 17:14.320
the quotation marks around animal love. And the quotation marks are there because Tim is just

17:14.320 --> 17:19.840
afraid YouTube will censor him if he uses a forbidden word. This is because YouTube will

17:19.840 --> 17:25.520
shut down videos, they'll demonetize videos, and I can not use certain words to explain certain

17:25.520 --> 17:30.000
ideas. I'm sure Tim would say, well, if someone clicked the video, they'd get the full story,

17:30.000 --> 17:34.080
and then they would walk away realizing that he's not saying it's true. He's actually saying

17:34.080 --> 17:40.800
the opposite. First of all, the viral clip is out of context. I refuse. I don't care if it's

17:40.800 --> 17:46.000
if it's Cenk Uygur. I don't care if it's Nick Fuentes. You take an out of context clip, and I

17:46.000 --> 17:50.800
can't tell what it is. I'm going to tell you the GTFO, period. Pretty straightforward. Tim clears

17:50.800 --> 17:55.760
things up. Anyone who'd watch his video would understand that this was about defending Cenk

17:55.760 --> 18:01.280
about the claim, not advancing it. But if we look under the comments of this video, we'll see that

18:01.280 --> 18:06.640
his clarifications haven't really affected a large number of viewers. Comment after comment

18:06.640 --> 18:11.520
about Cenk wanting to have sex with animals, I'd be a little worried if I made a video supposedly

18:11.520 --> 18:17.200
to defend someone, only to find everyone repeating the exact charge that I was trying to debunk.

18:17.200 --> 18:21.360
People don't really watch Tim's videos for his analysis, but to have their narratives be

18:21.360 --> 18:27.120
confirmed. In this case, it's a narrative about someone on the left being some sort of weird

18:27.120 --> 18:31.680
deviant. It also might not have helped things if Tim had not spent so much time complaining

18:31.680 --> 18:35.760
that Cenk yelled at him one time and that Tim doesn't like that he's running for office.

18:35.760 --> 18:40.960
That's what most of the video is actually about. And in the video titled, conservative memes are

18:40.960 --> 18:47.680
being censored because fact checkers think leftist media is the default. We get more on Tim's

18:47.680 --> 18:53.120
feelings about the left-wing hypocrisy in the media. Newsguard, which is apparently left-wing,

18:53.200 --> 18:58.720
had the gall to criticize The Daily Wire, which is a news outlet run by everyone's favorite Ben

18:58.720 --> 19:04.480
Shapiro. They say that, right here, does not repeatedly publish false content. Thumbs up.

19:04.480 --> 19:09.440
It's got a green check mark. Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, Newsguard, for letting me know

19:09.440 --> 19:14.320
that there are severe issues with Daily Wire, but at least they're not publishing false content,

19:14.320 --> 19:22.320
right? Actually, they say this, credibility. However, The Daily Wire frequently publishes

19:22.320 --> 19:28.320
false and misleading information. Okay, hold on. You told me they don't do that. And then,

19:28.320 --> 19:33.440
in your own content about it, you say they do do that. I got a contradiction here.

19:33.440 --> 19:40.320
Newsguard has made a factual error. I'm sorry. Got him. Now, a clever person here might go on

19:40.320 --> 19:45.520
to read the very lengthy 31 paragraphs detailing all the times The Daily Wire misrepresented a

19:45.520 --> 19:50.560
story, but no, that's not what Tim is here to do. He's here to talk about the little summary

19:50.560 --> 19:56.160
graphic at the top, not matching the more detailed breakdown at the bottom, while specifically this

19:56.160 --> 20:01.600
sentence here. Tim calls this inconsistency a factual error, but the error here appears to

20:01.600 --> 20:06.160
be that Newsguard isn't being hard enough on The Daily Wire in its summary graphic. And you know,

20:06.160 --> 20:12.160
I think we have to give it to Tim this time. Newsguard is just too soft on right-wing news websites.

20:12.160 --> 20:17.600
I'm not sure how being too soft on a right-wing news outlet proves that the fact checkers have

20:17.600 --> 20:22.640
a left-wing bias, though. Kind of the opposite, actually. Better luck next time, Tim. But my

20:22.640 --> 20:28.480
favorite part of this video is when Tim starts going off on Buzzfeed News. Let's see how angry he gets.

20:47.600 --> 20:57.760
Tim, though, thinks Buzzfeed News was running this story as something to laugh at and that

20:57.760 --> 21:11.440
they're all secretly racist. You know what's interesting, though? The Buzzfeed News article

21:11.440 --> 21:16.080
actually never mentions the race of either of the two men, and it doesn't publish pictures of them

21:16.080 --> 21:21.120
either. So how does Tim know they're black? I didn't just want to accuse Tim of making a

21:21.120 --> 21:25.360
racist assumption here, so I took the extra step of digging up the original video on this story

21:25.360 --> 21:31.520
from November 6th, 2019 titled, Buzzfeed wrote a fake headline about two black men fighting to death

21:31.520 --> 21:36.240
over chicken. So Buzzfeed News didn't mention race at all, but Tim puts it right in the headline.

21:36.240 --> 21:40.880
That's an interesting choice. Tim's problem with this chicken sandwich story is that there was no

21:40.880 --> 21:46.560
literal chicken sandwich in anyone's hands, but rather people were in line to buy said sandwich.

21:47.120 --> 21:53.280
For context, this sandwich was making a much awaited return, and Buzzfeed News based its headline

21:53.280 --> 21:59.200
on a statement from the police. Oh, as Tim argues, nowhere did they say they were fighting over a

21:59.200 --> 22:05.280
sandwich. What the police said was that it was preliminary, they said it's preliminary, but

22:05.280 --> 22:09.440
this was related to the release of a sandwich. Could it be that I don't know because of the

22:09.440 --> 22:12.800
release of the sandwich, a guy was going to meet up with another guy at the location and they

22:12.800 --> 22:16.320
weren't going to get the sandwich? The sandwich has nothing to do with it. It seems Tim got more

22:16.320 --> 22:21.280
information about this new story from an article in the Daily Mail which posted lots of pictures.

22:21.280 --> 22:26.400
There's a comment from the cousin of the stabbed man clearly upset that his cousin's death is being

22:26.400 --> 22:30.800
used to market a chicken sandwich. Tim seems to think this proves his point that the murder had

22:30.800 --> 22:36.400
nothing to do with the sandwich though. Then Tim starts to get really worked up. This is when they

22:36.480 --> 22:41.840
cover the violence. This is when they cover the violence that when I was growing up in Chicago,

22:41.840 --> 22:46.320
this is the kind of stuff we deal with. And now you've got this dude's family saying they weren't

22:46.320 --> 22:50.400
fighting over a chicken sandwich man, but that's the funny story that Buzzfeed gets to report,

22:50.400 --> 22:55.760
isn't it? These people are hypocrites and they're disgusting. You know, I never really claimed to

22:55.760 --> 23:01.360
be a media expert, at least not the way Tim does. I'm just curious, does Buzzfeed News ever dare to

23:01.360 --> 23:07.120
talk about the violence in Chicago? These articles are all from 2019 and they seem to suggest that,

23:07.120 --> 23:11.920
yes, in fact, they do. Lots of important stories are there. If Tim thinks this isn't enough,

23:11.920 --> 23:15.600
then I have some great news for him. He has a platform where he can cover all of these stories

23:15.600 --> 23:20.160
and more and can really put a spotlight on the violence problem in Chicago he apparently cares

23:20.160 --> 23:25.600
about a lot. For some reason, he chooses not to. In the interest of fairness, Tim's two primary

23:25.600 --> 23:30.800
channels actually did cover a very specific crime in Chicago quite extensively in 2019.

23:30.800 --> 23:37.120
One that did also involve issues of race and it so inspired Tim that he made 12 videos alone on

23:37.120 --> 23:42.720
the subject and that's the Jussie Smollett staged hate crime. So when Tim points his finger at

23:42.720 --> 23:47.760
Buzzfeed News for being racist and ignoring violence in Chicago, when Tim's recent work in

23:47.760 --> 23:53.600
said field is to obsessively discuss a staged hate crime, he can spare me the indignation. Maybe he

23:53.600 --> 23:58.000
should take a look at the sort of stories he propagates instead of lying about the people who

23:58.000 --> 24:03.600
are doing the very thing he accuses them of not doing. Oh, and going back briefly to the Popeyes

24:03.600 --> 24:08.160
story, Tim wanted to give credit to the Daily Mail for doing a better job covering the story.

24:08.160 --> 24:12.560
Funny how Tim doesn't get upset about the Daily Mail saying it was over a chicken sandwich, huh?

24:12.560 --> 24:17.760
Now let's talk about how much Tim cares about the media. In the artfully titled video,

24:17.760 --> 24:24.720
California has nuked leftist media from orbit. Hundreds of writers are being fired under new law.

24:24.720 --> 24:28.800
Tim describes how a new law was passed in California that puts a limit on how much

24:28.800 --> 24:32.960
work employers can purchase from freelancers without making them full-time employees.

24:33.920 --> 24:38.400
Tim sums up the problem for us like this. Are these leftists saying, hey,

24:39.680 --> 24:43.520
companies aren't paying their employees enough and they keep hiring freelancers?

24:44.320 --> 24:49.680
Got an idea. Let's make it so they can't hire freelancers more than 35 times per year.

24:50.400 --> 24:55.440
That way, they'll be forced to hire the freelancers, right? It all makes sense.

24:55.440 --> 25:00.960
This is a progressive victory, they say. In reality, it's very different. In reality,

25:00.960 --> 25:05.760
they say, well, we can't hire all these people. Just fire all these people. We'll save money

25:05.760 --> 25:11.520
and we'll figure it out somewhere else. Or better yet, they're going to hire freelancers in different

25:11.520 --> 25:15.200
states. You know what's going to happen to these people who don't have work anymore?

25:15.200 --> 25:19.040
They're not going to be able to pay their rent. Then they're going to end up in a homeless camp

25:19.120 --> 25:23.920
and it's going to be your fault. This video is in the context of talking about a new story where

25:23.920 --> 25:29.280
Fox eliminated 200 jobs right before the holiday season, no less. Many of these cuts are coming

25:29.280 --> 25:34.480
from SB Nation, a blogging network owned by Vox. Tim even reads a small excerpt in an official

25:34.480 --> 25:39.120
statement from SB Nation. This is a bittersweet note of thanks to our California independent

25:39.120 --> 25:43.840
contractors, John Ness. Executive director of SB Nation wrote in a post on Monday,

25:43.840 --> 25:50.080
in 2020, we will move California's team blogs from our established system with hundreds of

25:50.080 --> 25:54.720
contractors to a new one run by a team of new SB Nation employees. You know what they literally

25:54.720 --> 26:01.840
said? We need these jobs filled. If you're in California, you're fired. We're going to rehire

26:01.840 --> 26:06.080
because the jobs aren't going anywhere, other people. Think about that for a second. This is

26:06.080 --> 26:10.720
not a case of being told your company can't support you. I'm sorry, we have to let you go.

26:10.720 --> 26:15.440
It's not a case of Vox going out of business. It's literally Vox saying, you guys passed the law.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.560
I got to fire you, but this dude over here in Arizona, he's all good. He's hired. He gets your

26:20.560 --> 26:25.920
job now. What would happen if we clicked on that link and read the full statement? We'd find this

26:25.920 --> 26:31.280
telling paragraph. To comply with this new law, we will not be replacing California contractors

26:31.280 --> 26:36.800
with contractors from other states. Rather, we're encouraging any contractors interested in one of

26:36.800 --> 26:42.080
our newly created full-time or part-time employee positions to apply. We know many of our California

26:42.080 --> 26:46.400
contractors already have other full-time jobs and may not have the bandwidth to apply, but we hope

26:46.400 --> 26:52.800
to see many of them join us as employees. So SB Nation is getting rid of its freelance positions

26:52.800 --> 26:57.760
and replacing them with full-time and part-time jobs. Although I do feel for the freelancers who

26:57.760 --> 27:01.280
have full-time jobs and we're just doing this freelancing to make a little extra income.

27:01.840 --> 27:08.320
If there are examples of people being unfairly hurt by this law, this story isn't it. Tim tries

27:08.320 --> 27:12.720
to portray it as people being cast out in the streets with no source of income and now they're

27:12.720 --> 27:16.800
going to be struggling living in homeless camps because they can't pay their bills, saying that

27:16.800 --> 27:21.680
all these jobs are going out of state when in fact they aren't. They're being replaced by full-time

27:21.680 --> 27:27.520
positions, which is sort of how the law is supposed to work because full-time positions

27:27.600 --> 27:32.800
are better than freelance ones. And this is Tim all over. He finds these stories that he thinks

27:32.800 --> 27:38.400
reinforces narratives, in this case the leftist media championing socialist policies that destroy

27:38.400 --> 27:42.480
jobs, but he doesn't check the facts well enough to make sure they don't say the exact opposite.

27:42.480 --> 27:46.880
He finds enough information to confirm his narrative of leftist media pushing the destructive

27:46.880 --> 27:52.240
agenda and then he moves on, confident that his audience won't do the basics to fact check him.

27:52.240 --> 27:56.640
There's one criticism I know I'm going to get, so I want to address it right here.

27:57.280 --> 28:01.760
I've seen him use this defense on Twitter before, saying watch all my videos before you criticize

28:01.760 --> 28:07.760
me, which is frankly preposterous. When there are hundreds of hours, no one can possibly do this.

28:08.320 --> 28:14.320
The point of this response is to show you all what it's like to watch a single week of his content.

28:14.320 --> 28:18.960
If I was a person unfamiliar with Tim Poole and decided to give his content a try for a week,

28:18.960 --> 28:23.760
what would I find? What would I see? These are the results of that.

28:49.840 --> 28:53.120
Q&A. I'll have a community post asking for more questions in the future,

28:53.120 --> 28:57.440
so if you've got any questions for me, hold on to them, and we'll do a big QA video.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.000
That'll be fun. Like, comment, subscribe, hit the bell.
