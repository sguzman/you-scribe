WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.160
the overturning of Roe v. Wade will make abortion dramatically more difficult to obtain in the

00:04.160 --> 00:08.400
United States, and young conservative commentators are saying things like this.

00:08.400 --> 00:11.040
These feminists are so upset because they can't murder their children,

00:11.040 --> 00:12.400
they can't offer them out to Molech.

00:12.400 --> 00:17.920
That's Elijah Shafer. On his show Slightly Offensive, part of the Blaze Media Network,

00:17.920 --> 00:22.880
a right-wing media network founded in part by former Fox News firebrand Glenn Beck.

00:22.880 --> 00:25.920
And that's just the tip of the iceberg on the sort of stuff Shafer says.

00:25.920 --> 00:28.800
People think that Australia is great because it's an all-white country,

00:28.800 --> 00:30.560
and it's just that's the only reason why it's good.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.680
And I don't, you can say that that's white supremacists, no, it's just it's a homogenous

00:33.680 --> 00:37.840
group of people with less population than there is in California and a landmass bigger than the

00:37.840 --> 00:42.160
United States. They get along, they don't commit crime, they're clean, and they have a common,

00:42.160 --> 00:43.120
they have a common group.

00:43.120 --> 00:48.480
You think in the last days that you would refuse the mark of the beast,

00:48.480 --> 00:52.640
but you wouldn't even sacrifice being judged by your friends to not get a vaccine?

00:52.640 --> 00:57.520
Craving for baby's blood has never been stronger. And when you look at this woman before us,

00:57.680 --> 00:59.680
nobody is forcing you to be a whore.

00:59.680 --> 01:03.600
Shafer is a strange breed of conservative commentator. He has the opinions of a

01:03.600 --> 01:08.240
middle-aged right-wing white evangelical from the 1980s, but the style of an alt-right shit

01:08.240 --> 01:13.680
poster from the mid 2010s. He embodies an inherent hybrid of where right-wing commentary is heading,

01:13.680 --> 01:17.680
taking elements from previous conservative movements and coalescing them into this new

01:17.680 --> 01:22.480
style of commentary. To understand Shafer's quick ascent in the conservative commentary space,

01:22.480 --> 01:26.720
we have to go back and understand the rise of the religious right in American politics.

01:26.800 --> 01:31.200
Now, we could go back to the likes of Father Coughlin or Norman Vincent Peale,

01:31.200 --> 01:35.360
but instead let's start at the religious right's rise in the 1970s,

01:35.360 --> 01:39.440
particularly in its fight against abortion and its push for family values.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.320
While it's commonly believed that popular opposition to abortion is what galvanized

01:44.320 --> 01:48.800
religious people to flock to the right, Randall Balmer, the John Phillips professor in religion

01:48.800 --> 01:53.680
at Dartmouth College, conducted some research that presents a different picture. Paul Weyrich,

01:53.680 --> 01:57.600
a religious conservative political activist and co-founder of the Heritage Foundation,

01:57.600 --> 02:02.080
was hoping to capitalize on evangelical voters who had been slowly voting more frequently for

02:02.080 --> 02:06.880
the Republican Party following the end of World War II. Weyrich believed that if he could organize

02:06.880 --> 02:13.040
them on a mass scale, they would become a powerful voting bloc. Writing in the mid-1970s, Weyrich said,

02:13.680 --> 02:19.120
the new political philosophy must be defined by us conservatives in moral terms, packaged in

02:19.120 --> 02:23.600
non-religious language and propagated throughout the country by our new coalition. When political

02:23.760 --> 02:29.200
power is achieved, the moral majority will have the opportunity to recreate this great nation.

02:29.760 --> 02:33.600
Weyrich believed that if he could convince the leadership of evangelical and fundamentalist

02:33.600 --> 02:37.920
Christian leaders to advocate for conservative politicians, their congregations would all

02:37.920 --> 02:42.880
dutifully follow them in lockstep. And he floated a number of issues in their direction to catch the

02:42.880 --> 02:48.080
interest of religious folks with little success. Early on, this did include abortion. According to

02:48.080 --> 02:53.120
Balmer's research, evangelical leadership was largely indifferent to abortion. For example,

02:53.120 --> 02:58.640
evangelical leader Jerry Falwell's first anti-abortion sermon wasn't until 1978,

02:58.640 --> 03:03.920
five years after the 1973 Roe v. Wade verdict made abortion legal in the United States.

03:03.920 --> 03:08.720
There are also examples of various evangelical leaders expressing indifference or even tepid

03:08.720 --> 03:13.520
support of abortion. The rejection of abortion on religious moral grounds is something that actually

03:13.520 --> 03:18.400
came a little bit later. What finally captured the attention of evangelical leadership to become

03:18.400 --> 03:23.440
more involved in politics, though, was the Green v. Connolly ruling, which affirmed that a private

03:23.440 --> 03:27.760
school which practiced racial discrimination could not be eligible for a tax exemption.

03:28.320 --> 03:33.360
This impacted quite infamously Bob Jones University, which was a whites-only school.

03:34.000 --> 03:38.640
With tax-exempt status at risk, evangelical leadership was very quick to take the side of

03:38.640 --> 03:43.840
Bob Jones University, reframing the issue of being a whites-only school as a question of

03:43.840 --> 03:48.560
religious freedom. The school argued that since it didn't take any federal money, aside from not

03:48.560 --> 03:52.800
paying taxes, they shouldn't be expected to follow the same rules as public schools.

03:52.800 --> 03:58.560
This didn't hold up in court. Bob Jones University lost its tax-exempt status and thus lit a fire

03:58.560 --> 04:02.880
under evangelical leadership, and they soon began working with Wayrock and his allies to create an

04:02.880 --> 04:10.080
evangelical floating block. Only, racial discrimination wasn't quite popular enough in the 1970s, at least

04:10.080 --> 04:15.040
when it came to advocating that in public, so they started exploring other options. In 1978,

04:15.040 --> 04:19.840
a leaflet campaign in Minnesota by Catholic organizers was credited with getting anti-abortion

04:19.840 --> 04:24.240
candidates both senate seats, as well as the governorship, unlike evangelicals, right when

04:24.240 --> 04:28.960
Catholics had been fighting against abortion for years. Although abortion as an issue hadn't worked

04:28.960 --> 04:33.440
a few years prior, this success led Wayrock and his allies to rethink the tactic, and they started

04:33.440 --> 04:38.240
brainstorming how this issue could be sold to evangelicals. As a reminder, Roe v. Wade was

04:38.240 --> 04:42.880
five years old at this point. Anti-abortion sermons started being delivered and propaganda

04:42.880 --> 04:48.000
started being produced, such as the film series Whatever Happened to the Human Race? Here's a

04:48.000 --> 05:00.960
clip from that thing. As public sentiment among evangelicals began to change, anti-abortion took

05:00.960 --> 05:07.040
its place among other issues this newly christened, moral majority would champion, including anti-gay

05:07.040 --> 05:12.880
laws, christian prayer in school, among other things that would be labeled as family values.

05:12.880 --> 05:18.560
This block solidified during the 1980s, and in that time the religious right would become a force in

05:18.560 --> 05:23.360
American politics, often behind some of the most conservative social policies. They were accepted

05:23.360 --> 05:27.600
into the Republican party, and they refused to a number of different conservative policies.

05:27.600 --> 05:31.840
The religious right's influence can be heavily felt in the George W. Bush presidency, where

05:31.840 --> 05:37.200
professions of faith were common, including very strong overtures to religious right concerns,

05:37.200 --> 05:43.680
such as teaching creationism or generally being opposed to same-sex marriage. In the early years

05:43.680 --> 05:48.080
of the Obama presidency, the Tea Party movement was very much an inheritor of this Christian right

05:48.080 --> 05:52.240
movement. Though certain parts of the overall package waned over the years, such as prayer

05:52.240 --> 05:56.960
in schools, the fight against abortion remained constant, and affirmation to that cause is one

05:56.960 --> 06:02.160
of many reasons that led evangelicals to support Donald Trump in his bid for the presidency.

06:02.160 --> 06:06.720
And this leads us back to Elijah Schaeffer. He's relatively new to this scene,

06:06.720 --> 06:12.640
but he's an inheritor of this same brand of Christian conservatism. Born in 1993, Schaeffer

06:12.640 --> 06:17.680
entered the world of right-wing commentary in the mid-2018s in his mid-20s. His years before that

06:17.680 --> 06:21.680
were a combination of homeschooling and private schools, eventually graduating from a Christian

06:21.680 --> 06:26.480
university in California with a degree in molecular biology. Which is very strange,

06:26.480 --> 06:31.520
considering he doesn't believe in macroevolution. That is, the change in organisms that leads to the

06:31.520 --> 06:40.800
development of new species. His critiques against evolution really don't have any substance,

06:40.800 --> 06:45.840
and he gets to this vague, unanswerable question about why man is here, as this should somehow

06:45.840 --> 06:50.720
completely overturn all the evidence which he seems to believe he's made a thorough examination

06:51.040 --> 06:54.480
in the face of countless scientists working over the centuries.

07:10.320 --> 07:14.560
You may have noticed in that answer a lack of specificity. This is something you'll be

07:14.560 --> 07:19.120
seeing a lot as we go through Schaeffer's work, rambling that seems to be leading to a point,

07:19.120 --> 07:23.440
but never quite gets there before being derailed by something else. For example,

07:23.440 --> 07:26.720
when responding to his thoughts about evolution, here's where it ends up.

07:37.920 --> 07:42.640
I should mention at this point Schaeffer claimed to be sober at the time this supposed possession

07:42.640 --> 07:47.040
happened, though it did involve a friend who was on drugs at the time. Schaeffer himself has a

07:47.040 --> 07:52.080
history with psychedelics and other drugs that cause hallucinations. While I have no real insight

07:52.080 --> 07:56.320
into what happened to Schaeffer here, and I'm certainly not a doctor, I'm going to be bold and

07:56.320 --> 08:01.440
suggest that he may have been experiencing hallucinogenic persisting perception disorder,

08:01.440 --> 08:06.640
a hallucinogenic experience which has been known to happen sometimes years after a person has taken

08:06.640 --> 08:11.440
hallucinogenic drugs. Or there could be a number of other scientific explanations here for what's

08:11.440 --> 08:17.360
happening, or of course it is possible his friend was possessed by a literal demon that made its way

08:17.360 --> 08:21.360
into Schaeffer's body. Feel free to make up your own mind on which of these is the most likely

08:21.360 --> 08:26.080
outcome. Schaeffer credits Ben Shapiro with inspiring him to start a right-wing podcast,

08:26.080 --> 08:31.040
although he wanted his style to be a bit different. He considered Ben Shapiro to be inoffensive and

08:31.040 --> 08:36.240
more far-right provocateurs such as Milo Yiannopoulos to be offensive, and he wanted himself to be

08:36.240 --> 08:41.680
somewhere in the middle, hence the title of his show, Slightly Offensive. The first iteration

08:41.680 --> 08:46.000
of his show seems to have been lost to time. From how he described it in interviews, it was a series

08:46.000 --> 08:51.200
of studio-based opinion segments, not unlike his later work. Eventually this was reshaped into the

08:51.200 --> 08:56.240
mid-2018 version that still, at least partially, exists on his YouTube channel, where he would

08:56.240 --> 09:01.040
attend left-wing protests to interview people in an attempt to make them look ignorant. A tried and

09:01.040 --> 09:04.720
true technique practiced by Lawrence Southern, Steven Crowder, and various other right-wing

09:04.720 --> 09:09.120
commentators. Schaeffer's production quality was higher than usual for these street interviews

09:09.120 --> 09:13.600
because of his background working in commercial production. The actual quality of the interviews

09:13.600 --> 09:17.520
left something to be desired though, with Schaeffer often talking over, interrupting,

09:17.520 --> 09:19.920
and editing people to make them look as silly as possible.

09:34.720 --> 09:59.920
In a video published on June 29, 2018, Schaeffer interviewed people at a women's

09:59.920 --> 10:04.400
march. One of those people was a woman named Angie, who was kind enough to speak to me about

10:04.400 --> 10:29.680
the experience. Angie is

10:29.680 --> 10:33.360
one of several people who were featured in this video, and she describes the

10:33.360 --> 10:36.320
experience of the backlash that followed her appearance there.

10:59.680 --> 11:28.160
Angie would run into Schaeffer a few days later at another protest.

11:28.240 --> 11:34.320
I saw them kind of cornering an older lady who, and I could see that she was getting animated

11:34.320 --> 11:41.040
talking to him, and so I walked over and I said, you know, don't talk to him. He's gonna, you know,

11:41.040 --> 11:45.040
he's gonna make you a target on the internet, basically. He said, you know, he went into

11:45.040 --> 11:49.920
reasonable mode. He was like, you know, we're just trying to get all perspectives. I'm asking

11:49.920 --> 11:53.440
questions. You know, he said, I thought we had a really good conversation the other day.

11:54.160 --> 12:00.800
And I know that I kind of went off, not in an aggressive way, but in a way that was like,

12:00.800 --> 12:10.240
I don't understand how you can present yourself like this, and then switch to putting out content

12:10.240 --> 12:17.120
that you know is going to generate violent, hateful reactions. He's like, I don't condone

12:17.120 --> 12:21.920
any of that. And he was like, I'll say it to camera right now. And he did a direct to camera,

12:21.920 --> 12:26.720
you know, appeal to people to not make violent threats and all of that. The video was uploaded

12:26.720 --> 12:31.200
unedited to Shafer's YouTube channel, and Angie noticed that her child was visible in the shot

12:31.200 --> 12:36.000
where she had confronted him. Angie DM'd Shafer asking him to take the video down to protect her

12:36.000 --> 12:40.560
child's safety, which he did eventually do, but there was an interesting part of her interaction

12:40.560 --> 12:48.240
with him. He tried to be very complimentary about, you know, how I'd spoken, you know, he said,

12:48.880 --> 12:53.680
we didn't edit you, and I usually edit people, and you were well spoken, so we let your words

12:53.680 --> 12:59.600
just stand for themselves. And then he asked if I would be willing to do an interview with him.

13:01.680 --> 13:04.960
He was like, you know, people were really responding to you, you know, trying to

13:06.080 --> 13:11.440
stroke my ego or something. To Elijah Shafer, all of these appearances seem more like a game,

13:11.440 --> 13:15.920
an attempt to puff up his political side while trying to find foils on the other side he could

13:16.000 --> 13:21.120
film himself verbally jousting against. Something that's antithetical to actual journalism that

13:21.120 --> 13:25.360
purports itself to be genuinely trying to understand the motivations and opinions of people

13:25.360 --> 13:29.920
attending a protest. Here's an example of Shafer saying just that on an episode of Tim Pool's

13:29.920 --> 13:35.680
podcast. A lot of people grift and they use field reporting sort of there's this way to get in front

13:35.680 --> 13:39.600
of the camera, and their ultimate goal is they want to be a host. This is very common, right? I

13:39.600 --> 13:44.160
happen to have had a podcast before I went out on the field myself. It's always been coinciding.

13:44.160 --> 13:48.880
My podcast has always been about what I see on the field. So there's sort of that duplicity.

13:48.880 --> 13:53.680
He describes it a bit more clearly here and how he doesn't see this as a grift. A lot of people,

13:53.680 --> 13:57.680
like I said, use reporting to get the job that they want because I think generals are made in

13:57.680 --> 14:01.840
the trenches. I don't think that's a grift per se. The problem with his reasoning though is that,

14:01.840 --> 14:06.800
particularly in these early videos, he's not actually doing real reporting. He's going out

14:06.800 --> 14:11.120
with a political goal to make these people he disagrees with politically look stupid.

14:11.600 --> 14:17.200
As a result, these protests are framed as random assemblies of people who don't particularly know

14:17.200 --> 14:21.520
why they're there or what they believe and who are deeply confused about the world around them.

14:21.520 --> 14:25.280
It's at odds with other types of protest coverage where you might get clips like this.

14:25.760 --> 14:31.200
Them people who are out there when they go back in the morning to get us jobs, get us loans,

14:31.200 --> 14:35.520
get us, give us access, give us a chance. If we don't get no economic justice, we're still going

14:35.520 --> 14:38.480
to be in a situation that we're walking around and police are going to be able to do whatever

14:38.480 --> 14:42.640
they want to do to us. Or maybe something like this. I think there's an issue with people thinking

14:42.640 --> 14:47.920
that this is solely an American thing. It's not an American thing solely. White supremacy is

14:47.920 --> 14:52.400
worldwide and we need to acknowledge that a lot of the foundations for white supremacy in America

14:52.400 --> 14:58.160
are built in the UK. These are interviews with people who have genuinely and firmly held beliefs

14:58.160 --> 15:01.760
and what's more they give you an understanding of why people are attending these protests and what

15:01.760 --> 15:06.240
they're hoping to achieve. You still may not agree with them but at the very least you understand

15:06.240 --> 15:10.800
where they're coming from. Shafer was not interested in producing this type of understanding

15:10.800 --> 15:16.240
but rather videos he could use for mockery. The goal of these videos isn't to build a resume of

15:16.240 --> 15:21.680
genuine reporting to lead to the job of talk show host but rather conservative theater dressed up

15:21.760 --> 15:26.720
as journalism that would lead to a job spouting out propaganda to advance a right-wing agenda.

15:26.720 --> 15:31.360
These protest videos were an immediate success and Shafer was quickly embraced by the world of

15:31.360 --> 15:36.000
right-wing media particularly because as Shafer describes himself they were used to target a

15:36.000 --> 15:41.440
younger audience which the right-wing traditionally struggled with. My mission now is to bring the

15:41.440 --> 15:47.760
truth to expose the truth and to do it in a way that attracts young people. Shafer's overt professions

15:47.760 --> 15:52.480
of faith were present throughout his work in the early parts of his career as well. This may very

15:52.480 --> 15:56.720
well have put him on the radar of the religious right establishment, at least the part of that

15:56.720 --> 16:01.520
establishment that works in media, and he soon found himself with a plum spot working for Glenn

16:01.520 --> 16:06.320
Beck. Glenn Beck quite famously made a name for himself railing against Barack Obama during his

16:06.320 --> 16:11.200
first presidential term. His rise in conservative media was speaking to the Christian right. Here's

16:11.200 --> 16:20.160
an example from his restoring honor rally from 2010. America today begins to turn back to God.

16:21.520 --> 16:26.320
And here's another interesting clip from 2008 that reveals the specific audience Glenn Beck is

16:26.320 --> 16:31.280
speaking to. I get so much email on this and I think a lot of people do and I've only got a

16:31.280 --> 16:38.960
couple of seconds. Odds that Barack Obama is the Antichrist. No chance. First let's take a moment

16:38.960 --> 16:43.520
to applaud Glenn Beck for clearing the very low bar of saying that Barack Obama is not, in fact,

16:43.520 --> 16:48.400
the Antichrist. But more important in that clip was him saying how often he had been asked that

16:48.400 --> 16:53.360
question by his audience. This isn't a broad religious audience. He's cultivated, but rather

16:53.360 --> 16:58.080
the conservative Christian audience that has been shaped from decades of propaganda, making them

16:58.080 --> 17:02.960
tools of the Republican Party. One thing I should distinguish here is that Christianity in and of

17:02.960 --> 17:09.600
itself is multifaceted with many denominations ascribing to a wide variety of political domains.

17:09.600 --> 17:15.040
The group that follows and listens to the likes of Glenn Beck or Elijah Shafer, seeing their

17:15.040 --> 17:19.840
Christianity reflected in their conservative activism, are a very specific subset that have

17:19.840 --> 17:24.720
been cultivated and shaped by propaganda, making them the tools of conservative politicians.

17:25.280 --> 17:29.440
Although it certainly is an interesting question as to how much of conservative politics is shaped

17:29.440 --> 17:34.400
by the Christian right and vice versa, that's a bit outside the bounds for this video. Glenn Beck,

17:34.400 --> 17:39.200
who faced a lot of outside pressure, including boycotts that negatively affected his advertising

17:39.200 --> 17:43.920
at the time, eventually left Fox News, albeit ignoring an offer from the channel to keep him

17:43.920 --> 17:49.040
on the air. Beck started his own media company, The Blaze, which would eventually become Blaze

17:49.040 --> 17:56.080
Media in 2018 after a merger with Mark Levin's CRTV. The arrival of Blaze Media into Shafer's

17:56.080 --> 18:01.040
career speaks to the institutional support right-wing figures such as himself have access to.

18:01.040 --> 18:05.440
In the independent media space, it's a simple fact that the left is vastly underfunded,

18:05.440 --> 18:11.040
particularly on YouTube. For every major operation, such as The Young Turks, you have Blaze Media,

18:11.040 --> 18:15.360
The Daily Wire, and others who have multiple hosts and shows operating underneath them.

18:15.920 --> 18:20.400
There are just way more opportunities on the right, with figures sometimes plucked from

18:20.400 --> 18:25.360
obscurity and placed in positions of prominence, or for YouTubers who develop an audience and then

18:25.360 --> 18:29.600
have their show folded into that network, with prominent examples being Steven Crowder,

18:29.600 --> 18:34.640
Lauren Chen, and of course, Elijah Shafer. While working for Blaze Media, Shafer's profile would

18:34.640 --> 18:39.760
continue to rise, perhaps most famously covering the Black Lives Matter protest throughout 2020.

18:39.760 --> 18:44.160
His coverage was largely focused on spectacle more so than context and information. Though

18:44.160 --> 18:48.160
Shafer did certainly conduct interviews, the stories that seemed to get the most play were

18:48.160 --> 18:52.880
images of violence. This is where Shafer was ostensibly transitioning from someone who went

18:52.880 --> 18:56.880
to protests to make people look stupid to reporting on the facts on the ground, though

18:56.880 --> 19:01.360
he was often selective with the facts he chose to present. Here's how Shafer describes that

19:01.360 --> 19:07.680
experience in an interview with Ali Beth Stuckey from 2021. It seemed that almost like God's hand

19:07.680 --> 19:14.320
was on my life to put me in the worst situations possible, but to protect me. And here's one

19:14.320 --> 19:20.400
specific incident they mention. The group of people nearly killing a man, splitting his head

19:20.400 --> 19:25.280
open with the skateboard trucks and laughing and people spitting on him and then watching after they

19:25.280 --> 19:30.640
broke. That was in Dallas. I think I remember this. This was a guy trying to defend a business

19:30.640 --> 19:35.200
against the rioters with a machete and then the rioters basically bashed his head in until he

19:35.200 --> 19:39.440
was unconscious, right? It's interesting how Stuckey provided the additional context here

19:39.440 --> 19:43.600
because it mimics what went wrong with Shafer's coverage of this event. When Shafer posted this

19:43.600 --> 19:48.640
video on Twitter in May of 2020, it showed a scene of about five or six people attacking a

19:48.640 --> 19:53.040
man lying helpless on the ground while a dozen more stood around watching and shouting. I can't

19:53.040 --> 19:56.800
play the clip because of YouTube's restrictions on violent footage, but it's linked below if you'd

19:56.800 --> 20:01.920
like to check it out. The video was viewed 35 million times, and though there's some text

20:01.920 --> 20:06.640
providing a bit of context, it's obviously positioned to portray this man as an innocent victim.

20:06.640 --> 20:11.680
The narrative was pounced on by conservative media, eventually filtering its way up to President Trump.

20:12.320 --> 20:18.880
Innocent people have been savagely beaten like the young man in Dallas, Texas who was left dying

20:18.880 --> 20:24.080
on the street. About an hour and a half after this video was first posted, Shafer made another

20:24.080 --> 20:28.800
tweet with a longer version of the video, where 18 additional seconds revealed that this beating

20:28.800 --> 20:33.760
was immediately preceded by this man screaming while swinging a machete as he charged towards

20:33.760 --> 20:44.320
the group that would eventually attack him. This video was viewed 3.7 million times. The second

20:44.320 --> 20:48.640
tweet also reveals that he has no idea if this guy was the owner of the story he was supposedly

20:48.640 --> 20:52.960
defending or even what his name is, but he does assure his audience that this man, who showed up

20:52.960 --> 20:58.400
to protest with the machete, was not the instigator that night. Here's a statement on the event from

20:58.400 --> 21:03.440
Dallas Police. According to witnesses, the individual who came to the protest wheeled on a large knife

21:03.760 --> 21:07.840
slash machete at several protesters. An unknown protester was attempting to fight off this

21:07.840 --> 21:12.000
individual by using his skateboard and was subsequently cut in the hand, but not before

21:12.000 --> 21:16.800
disarming the individual. At this time, the crowd of protesters began assaulting the individual.

21:16.800 --> 21:21.280
As mentioned, the individual with the large knife was taken to the hospital and was last reported to

21:21.280 --> 21:25.840
be in stable condition. Neither the individual who was cut in the hand nor anyone in the way of the

21:25.840 --> 21:30.320
knife-wielding individual have come forward to file the complaint. Another video taken at night

21:30.400 --> 21:36.080
by a student, Yul Myasho, showed the event from another angle. Here's an excerpt from the

21:36.080 --> 21:40.880
Intercept article that spoke to him. In a phone interview, Myasho said that he started recording

21:40.880 --> 21:44.960
just after the man with the machete pulled it out and threatened the skateboarder who was slightly

21:44.960 --> 21:49.520
ahead of the rest of the group. Myasho insisted that, although glass was broken at hatchways at

21:49.520 --> 21:54.400
some point on Saturday night, there was no violence or looting of any kind when the man confronted the

21:54.400 --> 21:59.040
skateboarder. A fuller examination of the facts revealed that this man with the machete to be less

21:59.040 --> 22:04.400
an innocent victim and more active participant in escalating tensions that night. A flatter reading

22:04.400 --> 22:09.600
of this situation might be that a man showed up to a Black Lives Matter protest brandishing a machete

22:09.600 --> 22:14.400
in a threatening fashion. When protesters started throwing trash at him to get him to go away,

22:14.400 --> 22:19.520
he instead decided to charge at them screaming while swinging around the machete. The protesters

22:19.520 --> 22:25.040
responded by disarming him and then attacking him. It doesn't make any of what happened that night

22:25.120 --> 22:29.200
right, but it does reveal that Shafer had a very specific agenda when he edited the footage to

22:29.200 --> 22:34.160
remove that context. He very much wanted his audience to see Black Lives Matter protesters as

22:34.160 --> 22:39.920
unthinking mindless vandals attacking helpless individuals who are trying to protect businesses,

22:39.920 --> 22:45.280
eliminating any context that might present this individual as reckless and irresponsible.

22:45.280 --> 22:49.520
Shafer's perspective appears to be colored by his own biases against the protesters and his own

22:49.520 --> 22:53.520
personal conservative religious perspective. The way that they were pushing for everything

22:53.520 --> 22:58.960
demonic to change their gender, to explore their sexuality, and the way that they expressed that

22:58.960 --> 23:05.280
together of like, let's get together and let's do evil things. Let's hurt people. Let's kill people.

23:05.280 --> 23:11.120
Let's steal things. Let's destroy things. I mean, there is no other way to describe the energy there

23:11.680 --> 23:16.960
than purely satanic from hell. Here's another story Shafer mentioned in this interview. You

23:16.960 --> 23:21.440
know, someone had just put a gun into my face and I think the gun jammed or they pulled the

23:21.440 --> 23:26.400
trigger and it's on footage. This footage of someone apparently trying to murder Shafer

23:26.400 --> 23:32.320
can be found on his Twitter account in a five second clip he posted. What do we do? That's right.

23:33.280 --> 23:37.760
Whoa, that's right, man. It's hard to really know what's going on with five seconds taken out of

23:37.760 --> 23:42.560
what was likely a much longer day of filming, but let's deal with the obvious problem here.

23:42.560 --> 23:48.720
Pointing a gun at someone, even an unloaded one, is incredibly reckless and should not be condoned.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.560
Regardless of what anyone might think of Shafer and what he's arrived to do there,

23:52.560 --> 23:57.760
pointing a gun at the guy is clearly out of bounds. I would like to note that this irresponsible

23:57.760 --> 24:02.400
behavior, though, doesn't quite match how Shafer presented it in the interview. Even though it was

24:02.400 --> 24:06.240
reckless, it does appear to have been done for dramatic effect and doesn't really seem like

24:06.240 --> 24:11.200
someone is trying to kill him. Shafer himself even said as much when speaking to Fox News at the time.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.320
I don't think he pointed the gun at me to try to kill me. I think he was one of the stupidest people

24:16.320 --> 24:20.480
in the world. In a video posted four days after those comments were published, he said this to

24:20.480 --> 24:25.840
Mark Levin. All I can credit is God for that. I'm really true. I'm not trying to be a martyr here.

24:25.840 --> 24:30.160
I'm not saying I'm special. I'm not saying I actually was going to die. But the fact that as

24:30.160 --> 24:36.160
we just saw last night, it's very, very probable and possible that you can die at these things.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.880
This is a pattern with much of Shafer's reporting. Footage, often very heavily edited,

24:40.880 --> 24:45.440
is presented in a deliberate effort to frame protesters as violent or dangerous.

24:45.520 --> 24:49.680
And the story is less about the reasons for violence at these demonstrations and instead

24:49.680 --> 24:54.720
Shafer inserting himself into the narrative as a victim. He is showing up to these protests,

24:54.720 --> 24:59.360
not as a neutral presence, but as someone who is being targeted by the left and therefore

24:59.360 --> 25:03.440
their opposition. That group right there that was assaulting me with their camera that was coming

25:03.440 --> 25:08.880
up to me. This is all very ironic because as much as he may talk about how dangerous violence from

25:08.880 --> 25:14.080
protesters are, he does describe the most debilitating injury he got as being not from

25:14.080 --> 25:18.960
left wing protesters, but rather the police. Department of Homeland Security is the one who's

25:18.960 --> 25:25.040
hurt me the worst, not actually Antifa. What was the situation? It was at the federal courthouse

25:25.040 --> 25:29.840
and they just shot with a gas powered like point blank with a like whatever flash being in my

25:29.840 --> 25:35.200
shin and just cracked open my shin. It's strange how he fixates on the left being dangerous and

25:35.200 --> 25:40.640
out of control. But when the police injure him, that doesn't lead to any thought about how heavily

25:40.640 --> 25:45.360
armed the police are and the way in which they deploy that force against unarmed people.

25:45.360 --> 25:50.080
By framing himself as a victim, Shafer is vilifying the left, something he was doing

25:50.080 --> 25:54.320
in his earlier work as well. Contriving conversations to make protesters look bad

25:54.320 --> 25:59.760
just turned into making himself a victim, also to vilify the protesters. And while there might be

25:59.760 --> 26:05.120
an interesting conversation as to how we understand violence that happens at demonstrations,

26:05.120 --> 26:10.080
or how some people who attend protests may not have the best or most well thought out takes,

26:10.080 --> 26:14.640
the issue I really want to focus on is that Shafer is clearly and obviously operating with

26:14.640 --> 26:20.000
an agenda. He is not a neutral journalist or reporter in any sense of the word, he is showing

26:20.000 --> 26:26.240
up to be a propagandist. And this is very explicitly a religious political operation for him.

26:26.240 --> 26:29.760
The narratives that have been given to the people in the church are progressive narratives,

26:29.760 --> 26:33.920
they come from Satan, they're from the mouth of Beezlebug himself. And if you still somehow think

26:33.920 --> 26:38.160
Shafer is acting like a journalist, here he is on his show describing why he highlights

26:38.160 --> 26:42.480
specific footage of people at protests. Well, people say, well, why do you film these people?

26:42.480 --> 26:46.640
It is genuinely to publicly mock them. And it is because it works.

26:46.640 --> 26:50.080
Mockery is the point. This isn't journalism, it's propaganda.

26:50.720 --> 26:56.080
There was one notable exception in Shafer's career though, when he quite famously attended

26:56.080 --> 27:00.800
the January 6th Capitol riot where hundreds of Trump supporters broke into the Capitol building

27:00.800 --> 27:05.920
in an effort to overturn the democratic election of Joe Biden. At the time, Shafer seemed almost

27:05.920 --> 27:11.120
jubilant, as he described it as a revolution in progress, and he took some heat for photographing

27:11.120 --> 27:16.320
a computer screen in Nancy Pelosi's office. At the time, Shafer did have some less than comforting

27:16.320 --> 27:21.280
words for Trump supporters. The Trump supporters that are denying that Trump supporters could do

27:21.280 --> 27:26.960
this, I mean, have you not heard the sentiments from people who follow Trump? I mean, they are

27:26.960 --> 27:32.000
pissed, they are upset. I made a whole video on Tucker Carlson's Patriot Purge series,

27:32.000 --> 27:36.240
but I want to highlight one section where Shafer appears. This time, his tone towards

27:36.240 --> 27:41.840
Trump supporters has changed a bit. January 6th was just, you know, mom and dad who were mad

27:41.840 --> 27:46.720
about what they saw to be an election that they thought was unfair, rigged, fortified, stolen. It

27:46.720 --> 27:50.480
doesn't matter what you say it is, they were just angry and a lot of them just got caught up in the

27:50.480 --> 27:55.280
front lines of chaos. They thought that rioting was like a game, maybe. Supposedly, the violence

27:55.280 --> 28:01.680
of January 6th is excused as manipulation by the FBI of innocent Trump supporters, but violence

28:01.760 --> 28:08.640
at a BLM protest is some kind of demonic presence on earth. Throughout 2020 and 2021, Shafer

28:08.640 --> 28:13.280
transitioned to doing more in-studio work, hosting Slightly Offensive and You Are Here,

28:13.280 --> 28:18.480
with the latter being co-hosted by right-wing commentator Sydney Watson. This part of Shafer's

28:18.480 --> 28:23.600
career starts to get really nasty, and he spends less time on the illusion of grappling with the

28:23.600 --> 28:28.640
idea of his political opponents and instead mocking their appearance. They cut their breasts off,

28:28.720 --> 28:33.440
they have scars, they all look like Hillary Clinton after she lost another election,

28:33.440 --> 28:37.760
butch haircuts, depression in the eyes, and you just go, man, if you were living a life

28:37.760 --> 28:42.080
that led to wholeness, why do you look like that? Many of his videos include moments like that,

28:42.080 --> 28:46.880
picking out random people, often videos circulated by the ellipse of TikTok Twitter account,

28:46.880 --> 28:51.360
which he notes as a friend of his, and mocking their appearance. Here's another example.

28:51.360 --> 28:56.640
I love that we all got to go to the zoo for free today. You saw a couple of hippopotamuses and then

28:56.640 --> 29:01.840
an elephant in the beginning. It always is the women who are incapable of naturally getting

29:01.840 --> 29:07.440
impregnated that have the most complaints about abortion. Much of his content is just this vicious

29:07.440 --> 29:11.920
bullying of random people on the internet with no real power. At this point in his career,

29:11.920 --> 29:17.760
it's the main tool Shafer uses, although there is an alternative he mentions. Somebody asked me,

29:17.760 --> 29:20.960
they think the only other alternative is like violence. So it's like you could either A,

29:20.960 --> 29:26.160
mock the people or B, kill them. And I'm going to say there's two options. One of them is illegal

29:26.160 --> 29:30.240
and you'll go to prison. The other one, you get to have a show and you get to collect Barbies.

29:30.240 --> 29:34.800
So, you know, I take, I'll take the first one in the moment and I try to avoid the violence

29:34.800 --> 29:38.400
for as long as possible in life. It's kind of him to say he's willing to avoid violence

29:39.040 --> 29:44.960
for the moment. And this brings us to Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse and Shafer are bros,

29:44.960 --> 29:49.520
and Shafer quite infamously interviewed Rittenhouse shortly before he killed two men and wounded

29:49.520 --> 29:55.120
another at a BLM demonstration. And afterwards, he was quickly branded a conservative hero.

29:55.120 --> 30:00.000
After Rittenhouse was found not guilty of murder, he appeared on Shafer's You Are Here show

30:00.000 --> 30:05.920
for a conversation that can be described as very friendly. This interview is not an easy watch,

30:05.920 --> 30:10.880
largely because there's far too much discussion about all the women Rittenhouse wants to have sex

30:10.880 --> 30:15.520
with. The main purpose, though, is summed up by Shafer here. Just it's just cool to know,

30:15.520 --> 30:20.320
though, that you are a real person, that you're not a meme. Shafer wanted to humanize Rittenhouse,

30:20.320 --> 30:24.880
to reaffirm to his far right audience that in spite of the fact that Rittenhouse will supposedly

30:24.880 --> 30:30.240
claim to support BLM, at the end of the day, Rittenhouse is one of their guys, a tool to be

30:30.240 --> 30:34.560
wielded against the left, because he's willing to use violence against their political opposition.

30:34.560 --> 30:38.160
It's why another running theme through this interview is the jovial celebration of the

30:38.160 --> 30:43.120
violence committed by Rittenhouse. And you were armed, and unlike some people that that that

30:43.120 --> 30:47.680
fateful night, they didn't listen to the directions of somebody with a firearm, but I was smart

30:47.680 --> 30:58.160
enough. And when I mention Shafer having a far right audience, this will become increasingly

30:58.160 --> 31:03.760
clear as we examine the topics and talking points that he uses. The right wing embrace of Rittenhouse

31:03.760 --> 31:09.200
is not a product of someone acting in self defense in and of itself, but rather for taking violent

31:09.200 --> 31:15.200
action against political opposition. Had Rittenhouse been, as is often framed, defending himself in a

31:15.200 --> 31:20.000
completely different setting with no political dimension, say the parking lot of them all, I

31:20.000 --> 31:25.520
suspect he would not be so readily embraced by the right wing. The fact that he was defending himself

31:25.520 --> 31:30.080
in the midst of a Black Lives Matter protest against those who were on that particular side

31:30.080 --> 31:35.040
of the political divide is precisely why he's heralded as a hero. It's about normalizing

31:35.040 --> 31:41.200
violence against the political opposition. Elijah Shafer is, as I've hopefully demonstrated at this

31:41.200 --> 31:45.600
point, a religious ideologue who will tacitly endorse violence against his opposition, from

31:45.600 --> 31:50.720
celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse to creating a false dichotomy of mockery or violence, to casting his

31:50.720 --> 31:56.720
opponents as literal demons. The implication is the same. The other side of the political spectrum

31:56.720 --> 32:03.120
is deserving of violence, and should be seen as inherently evil. He's not explicitly saying

32:03.120 --> 32:08.160
people should be violently attacked, but he understands and sympathizes with that approach,

32:08.240 --> 32:12.640
and he might even call you a hero if you do it. But there's more to this guy than religiously

32:12.640 --> 32:18.800
motivated violence. He also has some issues with the LGBT community. Here he is making what I

32:18.800 --> 32:34.240
assume are jokes. I can't speak for the gay community myself, but I am offended on behalf

32:34.240 --> 32:40.320
of anyone who enjoys comedy for that exchange. These jokes aren't entirely stylistic, though.

32:40.320 --> 32:45.120
Shafer uses humor much in the way the alt-right used irony and sarcasm to mask their true intent,

32:45.120 --> 32:50.240
and charismatically attract a younger audience who appreciate edgy jokes, even if it's more edge

32:50.240 --> 32:55.520
than joke. I don't know if this is a deliberate tactic Shafer is using, or if it's just his brand

32:55.520 --> 33:00.640
of humor, but it does explain his success regardless. Painful attempts at homophobic humor

33:00.640 --> 33:05.600
aside, and there are countless jokes Shafer makes about being gay, he does eventually let slip what

33:05.600 --> 33:10.800
his real concerns are. Thirteen-year-olds like this guy he would argue should look at porn, and so

33:10.800 --> 33:14.080
what's the difference of looking at porn or getting involved in a sexual confrontation with

33:14.080 --> 33:18.800
an adult online, and I think that they're planning ahead decades so that they can have sex with kids

33:18.800 --> 33:23.920
in the metaverse? That's where I think we're headed. They, whoever they are, are playing a

33:23.920 --> 33:29.920
very long game by normalizing pedophilia now so they can have sex with kids in the metaverse

33:29.920 --> 33:35.200
in the future. The logic of this plan escapes me, as it's weird that these supposed groomers are

33:35.200 --> 33:40.160
expecting to still be virile enough 30 years into the future. This is an example of how Shafer

33:40.160 --> 33:46.320
analyzes the news. He connects a vague fear of big tech with a groomer conspiracy theory to shape

33:46.320 --> 33:52.160
nonsensical narratives, narratives that are very evocative of old Christian conservative arguments.

33:52.800 --> 33:56.800
The groomer narrative that has been so popular on the right lately has been something Shafer has

33:56.880 --> 34:02.080
been exposing for a while. Here he is talking about it in 2021. Even with the gay pride stuff,

34:02.080 --> 34:05.680
originally it was like dude don't you just want gay people to be able to do what they want to do

34:05.680 --> 34:10.160
in their closet? And you're like okay fine go ahead and then now it's like yeah if you want

34:10.160 --> 34:14.560
them to have sex with your kid you're the bigot. None of these ideas are new and Shafer's opinions

34:14.560 --> 34:19.280
are just regurgitated right-wing propaganda. This same rhetoric was used to attack the gay

34:19.280 --> 34:26.000
community for decades. Here's an example from 1961's Boys Beware. Jimmy didn't know was that

34:26.000 --> 34:32.880
Ralph was sick. A sickness that was not visible like smallpox but no less dangerous and contagious.

34:32.880 --> 34:39.920
A sickness of the mind. You see Ralph was a homosexual. A person who demands an intimate

34:39.920 --> 34:46.480
relationship with members of their own sex. 60 years later the message is the same. People outside

34:46.480 --> 34:51.280
the cis heterosexual category should be considered dangerous. Here are some examples of Shafer's

34:51.280 --> 34:57.120
rhetoric getting even more extreme. They want what they cannot have or the last bastion besides

34:57.120 --> 35:00.640
forcibly raping and killing the kids while you have sex with them which is eventually where they

35:00.640 --> 35:05.440
want to go right. And in this very video he ends with a particularly chilly note. You want me to

35:05.440 --> 35:10.800
say your pronouns? Ask me if I care if you died today. I literally don't care. You could literally

35:10.800 --> 35:15.680
get hit by a bus and the world would be boom. And here he is being even more explicit responding

35:15.680 --> 35:20.880
to a video that discusses how to use more inclusive language to describe intersex people.

35:20.880 --> 35:25.360
My advice is to use language that focuses on function and not just form. That means focusing

35:25.360 --> 35:29.200
on the actual function that you're talking about such as people who can get pregnant,

35:29.200 --> 35:33.200
people who can get other people pregnant, people who are at risk of testicular cancer and so on

35:33.200 --> 35:37.360
and so forth. Where's Kyle Rittenhouse when you need him? You know that's all when I watch these

35:37.360 --> 35:43.920
people I have no other thoughts. You are to me a potential child molester and you are a

35:43.920 --> 35:48.240
child predator. You are a threat and threats need to be neutralized. Yeah and we don't advocate

35:48.240 --> 35:52.880
for killing people. I mean Drew Hernandez immediately has to help Shafer walk back these

35:52.880 --> 35:58.000
comments. Though saying someone needs to be neutralized has a pretty clear implication.

35:58.000 --> 36:02.640
Elijah Shafer thinks trans and non-binary people's lives aren't worth caring about

36:02.640 --> 36:08.880
and if they make their identities visible around children they should be, in his words, neutralized.

36:08.880 --> 36:14.400
What makes all of this moral panic so unconvincing is how it fixates on members of the LGBT community.

36:14.480 --> 36:19.360
Overwhelmingly, child predators are straight and cisgender. Something that's obviously true when

36:19.360 --> 36:24.080
you consider the relative size of populations being discussed. If discussions of sexuality around

36:24.080 --> 36:28.560
children marks someone as a groomer, most of the efforts should be focused on stopping straight

36:28.560 --> 36:33.920
cisgender people from mentioning their sexuality around children. Never mind, gender identity is

36:33.920 --> 36:39.360
actually distinct from sexuality and is relatively harmless when being discussed around anybody.

36:39.840 --> 36:45.120
But of course there is no discussion around displays of heterosexual sexuality around children

36:45.120 --> 36:49.920
because this was never about protecting children. It was about demonizing trans and non-binary

36:49.920 --> 36:54.480
people the same way it was used and continues to be used against gay people. The religious right

36:54.480 --> 36:59.440
has long been a political adversary to the LGBT community and Shafer is once again perfectly

36:59.440 --> 37:04.880
happy to take up that cause, even endorsing violence on the basis of a lie. This isn't the

37:04.960 --> 37:10.080
only community Shafer has a problem with though. For example, he quite infamously tweeted this out,

37:10.080 --> 37:15.520
I despise the Chinese so much because I was with them my whole life. We always had exchange

37:15.520 --> 37:20.800
students. Even as an adult, my roommates were rich Chinese pretending to care about education.

37:20.800 --> 37:26.080
I know what few will admit. They are our enemies. It's competition. You're the dumb one.

37:26.720 --> 37:30.880
This tweet was deleted but he still has several up clarifying his position.

37:30.880 --> 37:36.400
Chinese citizens rape our system to use it against us. Sorry the haters don't realize this.

37:36.400 --> 37:42.320
They admit this to me. Only Twitter people pretend this isn't true. Americans who are Asian are my

37:42.320 --> 37:46.960
friend but CCP funded plants are not. I'm aware of the difference and don't care about your

37:46.960 --> 37:52.320
political correctness. Our nations are at war and I'm not playing nice. There were several other

37:52.320 --> 37:56.880
tweets like this and I hope those were clear enough. This goes beyond being opposed to the

37:56.880 --> 38:02.160
government of China and extends that opposition to all Chinese nationals. Shafer sees them as

38:02.160 --> 38:06.560
enemies as if every Chinese person is an unthinking pawn of their government and no

38:06.560 --> 38:12.000
independent thought exists there in a country of over one billion people. There's no other way

38:12.000 --> 38:17.200
to see this than bigotry against the Chinese but this is a bit more insidious than that as we look

38:17.200 --> 38:21.520
deeper into Shafer's comments on immigration because it gets at the heart of another issue

38:21.520 --> 38:26.640
he's talking about. That he's very concerned that the United States of America is becoming less white.

38:26.880 --> 38:31.680
Here's a clip of him expressing that in a 2021 video on Tim Pool's podcast.

38:31.680 --> 38:35.280
One thing that I can agree with critical race theory on is they do say that America was made

38:35.280 --> 38:40.480
by white people for white people and I've read the documents and before 1965 it specifically

38:40.480 --> 38:45.120
states like for our posterity when the immigration laws were changed when we had this similar

38:45.120 --> 38:49.920
biosphere and there was there was this majority of people in every nation whether it's religion,

38:49.920 --> 38:54.880
race, it's culture, there has to be shared value and we were sold this future for America which

38:54.880 --> 38:58.960
was a total scam and I believe had communist influence. What Shafer is referring to here is

38:58.960 --> 39:04.320
the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, a topic that is very much a pain point among

39:04.320 --> 39:08.880
white nationalists. This federal law abolished quotas on immigration that were established in

39:08.880 --> 39:13.600
the 1920s which were designed to maintain a specific ethnic diversity of the country.

39:13.600 --> 39:19.360
In other words the law Shafer so upset about was done to counter another law that was explicitly

39:19.360 --> 39:24.080
racist which was designed to keep non-white people from immigrating to the United States.

39:24.640 --> 39:29.680
Shafer favors a law that ensures the country remains overwhelmingly white which means that

39:29.680 --> 39:35.680
particular group would hold all the political power. This is I think quite obviously a white

39:35.680 --> 39:40.720
nationalist talking point. In this conversation Shafer tries to deflect this obviously racist

39:40.720 --> 39:45.120
point he's making to claim he's worried about some kind of communist plot to overthrow the

39:45.120 --> 39:50.640
country. This conspiracy theory is a rambling mess that doesn't really make sense. Eventually Shafer

39:50.720 --> 39:55.520
gets called out by Tim Poole for making a racist argument and I can't believe I just said that.

39:55.520 --> 39:59.760
Number one reason why I'm saying why expats don't fit in is because in America it's seen as being

39:59.760 --> 40:03.760
really great to share your political views you actually are like seen as sort of being brave

40:03.760 --> 40:08.320
and in Japan you will be ostracized. There's a word for that. They're racist. Well how is that

40:08.320 --> 40:14.320
racism if Japan is literally racist they're an ethno state and they do not they they don't. How

40:14.320 --> 40:19.840
is that racism of a homogeneous Japanese culture wanting to preserve a certain ethnic group? About

40:19.840 --> 40:24.880
a year later we see more of Shafer's thoughts on immigration describing security at the border.

40:24.880 --> 40:28.080
Like like the border situation right we can't figure out what to do with people catch and release

40:28.080 --> 40:32.640
title 42. We don't know what's going on like it is hard to know what to do but in the end there

40:32.640 --> 40:35.680
has been situations where people have taken a similar approach they got the shit beat out of

40:35.680 --> 40:40.160
them like knocked out hypothetically so you get beat up you get shot or whatever. I don't know if

40:40.160 --> 40:44.080
that's the solution and if it's on YouTube and you look it up but it's also the fact is that some

40:44.080 --> 40:47.760
people have taken that approach of like just going to violence and to be honest it worked.

40:47.760 --> 40:52.560
The comfort Shafer has with discussing violence this time referring to people crossing the border

40:52.560 --> 40:57.600
illegally is worrying but of course it doesn't end there. Shafer has a history of sharing white

40:57.600 --> 41:03.280
nationalist memes like this one below using the black sun symbol a symbol by the way which was

41:03.280 --> 41:08.480
used by the recent racist massed shooter in buffalo who deliberately targeted black people.

41:08.480 --> 41:13.760
More than sharing memes and talking points Shafer has made other overtures to the extreme far right.

41:13.760 --> 41:17.520
Anytime slander comes from the media I'm like that person is probably cool like hey

41:17.520 --> 41:22.480
that's a that's a nazi I'm like let me go speak to which brings us to Elijah Shafer's on air

41:22.480 --> 41:27.280
conversations with Nick Fuentes. If you're not familiar with the name I recommend this video

41:27.280 --> 41:32.960
from Mildred of the Goo Realm who details how Nick Fuentes pushes fascism from his weird

41:32.960 --> 41:38.000
little corner of the internet into the mainstream. Fuentes had a YouTube channel until it was banned

41:38.000 --> 41:42.960
for hate speech and this article has a helpful comment on Fuentes's view on white nationalism.

41:42.960 --> 41:46.720
The reason I wouldn't call myself a white nationalist it's not because I don't see

41:46.720 --> 41:50.480
the necessity for white people to have a homeland and for white people to have a country

41:50.480 --> 41:56.240
it's because I think that kind of terminology is used almost exclusively by the left into fame and

41:56.240 --> 42:01.200
I think the terminology and the labels that we use I don't think that we can look at them outside of

42:01.200 --> 42:06.880
the context of their connotations in America. Fuentes very deliberately and carefully crafts

42:06.880 --> 42:12.320
his image to be as far right as possible while still having a degree of plausible deniability

42:12.320 --> 42:17.120
or at least plausible to anyone who isn't paying close attention to the fascism he's obviously

42:17.120 --> 42:21.920
trying to push. One notable moment in Fuentes's career was when he decided to ambush Ben Shapiro

42:21.920 --> 42:26.480
in the middle of the street when he was with his family and while anyone familiar with this channel

42:26.480 --> 42:30.800
knows I have no love for Ben Shapiro aside from his wonderful fiction about political correctness

42:30.800 --> 42:35.920
leading to a nuclear bomb going off I do think it's incredibly disrespectful and gross to confront

42:35.920 --> 42:41.680
him and put his family including his children on camera. Although certainly not the worst thing

42:41.680 --> 42:46.240
Fuentes has ever done I wanted to bring it up because his cameraman that day happened to be

42:46.240 --> 42:51.440
Elijah Shafer. And that footage that we just saw that interaction with Ben I happen to have filmed

42:51.440 --> 42:56.560
and I guess this means that we have a history of being around the same circles. What's interesting

42:56.560 --> 43:00.560
about this interview is not just that Shafer is having a friendly chat with a white nationalist

43:00.560 --> 43:05.600
but that he has actively participated in something Fuentes has been very vocal about with his tactics

43:05.600 --> 43:10.240
finding ways to soften his extreme rhetoric to make it more appealing to a wide audience.

43:10.240 --> 43:14.800
Shafer interviewed Fuentes twice that day once on his slightly offensive show and then

43:14.800 --> 43:20.480
on You Are Here. The You Are Here one is a bit tough to watch as Shafer's co-host Sydney Watson

43:20.480 --> 43:25.040
makes it clear she had never heard of Fuentes and she seems a bit shaken by some of his opinions.

43:25.040 --> 43:30.080
The old world the old way of doing things. Women don't drive don't vote type of thing or something

43:30.080 --> 43:34.800
like that I mean approximating like Saudi Arabia I don't think they're too far off the mark. I mean

43:34.800 --> 43:40.000
you could potentially go and live in Saudi Arabia then. Watson is not up to the task of pushing back

43:40.000 --> 43:44.320
in a meaningful way against Fuentes even when he's talking about taking away all of her rights

43:44.320 --> 43:48.720
and towards the end of the interview she says this. It's really funny people are like Sydney's

43:48.720 --> 43:52.080
really triggered and I'm honestly just sitting here just listening and just you know getting a

43:52.080 --> 43:56.400
feel for things but I was saying to Elijah it's interesting I think you're being very respectful

43:56.400 --> 44:00.800
and it's and I think that's really nice because people make you out to be this you know assassin

44:00.800 --> 44:06.080
that's going to just stab everybody in the face. So while Fuentes may want to turn her into a

44:06.080 --> 44:11.120
second-class citizen reducing her to an incubator for children Watson appreciates that he's at least

44:11.120 --> 44:17.040
willing to have a civil conversation about it so that's lovely. Shafer takes the opposite approach

44:17.040 --> 44:21.600
not in that he more aggressively pushes back against Fuentes so much as he's interested in

44:21.600 --> 44:28.640
coaching him. Here's a quick example you know 3.8 billion dollars per year for Israel and and all

44:28.640 --> 44:34.320
of this you know how how can you really say you're America first if you're so fixated on the benefit

44:34.320 --> 44:37.600
of another country and she would. Can I ask you a question there though before you even give her

44:37.600 --> 44:41.680
answer is like so when you say this this is where a lot of people I think get turned off even these

44:41.680 --> 44:46.720
kind of questions because obviously I know where this is headed is like was your was your question

44:46.720 --> 44:51.840
just on foreign aid in general or did you see something like I could question a foreign aid

44:51.840 --> 44:56.880
but not to this country. This is a very astute place to cut Fuentes off what could have turned

44:56.880 --> 45:02.560
into a very anti-Semitic rant is quickly reframed to sound like Fuentes is just concerned about

45:02.560 --> 45:07.600
foreign aid as if there's nothing about Israel or the Jewish people Fuentes has a problem with.

45:07.600 --> 45:12.160
The briefest of glances into Fuentes's history reveals numerous anti-Semitic statements and

45:12.160 --> 45:16.400
beliefs it's almost trivial to find clips of him jokingly denying the Holocaust or saying the

45:16.400 --> 45:22.400
Jewish people aren't part of western civilization or how he has concerns over Jewish power and while

45:22.400 --> 45:28.160
I'm citing this ADL article to demonstrate Fuentes's anti-Semitic past Shafer himself actually pulled

45:28.160 --> 45:32.000
it up during his interview with Fuentes and addressed it like this. There's nowhere like

45:32.000 --> 45:35.760
here's where Nick Fuentes beat up a black guy and said the n-word like there's nothing like this

45:35.760 --> 45:41.600
it's just these these ideas like he wants to fight against transgenderism like well I do too

45:41.600 --> 45:46.480
so and then everyone watching this is like yeah yeah you know it's that's cool then they go Fuentes

45:46.480 --> 45:50.880
has used his platform to make numerous anti-Semitic and racist comments so you didn't do anything

45:50.880 --> 45:56.000
racist or anti-Semitic you made jokes in here and said some things you said some bad things

45:56.000 --> 45:59.760
apparently according to these standards I'm just saying what it says. It's really something

45:59.760 --> 46:04.960
watching Shafer in real time not actually engaging with any of the evidence cited but gently

46:04.960 --> 46:09.120
hand waving it away given his audience the impression that he's providing a rebuttal

46:09.120 --> 46:14.560
the incredibly racist and anti-Semitic jokes aren't considered racist because Fuentes didn't

46:14.560 --> 46:20.320
literally beat up a black guy while shouting the n-word also they aren't jokes here's a tweet

46:20.320 --> 46:25.760
Fuentes makes that Shafer doesn't acknowledge at all any serious person thinking about globalization

46:25.760 --> 46:30.720
and demographic changes should actually care a lot about racial differences in intelligence

46:30.720 --> 46:35.840
but this subject doesn't interest you because it's not convenient for your Trojan horse brand of

46:35.840 --> 46:42.400
kosher nationalism that's not a joke and neither is this comment from Shafer wants to preserve

46:42.400 --> 46:46.880
white identity I guess in some way and Christianity which is like not very extreme ideas these are

46:46.880 --> 46:51.760
just like it's just apolitical ideology it's one of many that are out there right calling Fuentes's

46:51.760 --> 46:58.400
ideas which are white nationalist ideas one of many is certainly true personally I would

46:58.400 --> 47:02.960
consider someone tried to make America more like Saudi Arabia including take away the rights of

47:02.960 --> 47:10.080
women to be fairly extreme Fuentes is a fascist but this coaching isn't just for the benefit of

47:10.080 --> 47:15.120
Fuentes it also helps train his audience as well I'm going to play a short clip from the podcast

47:15.120 --> 47:19.040
I Don't Speak German that went over this very interaction the voice you'll be hearing is from

47:19.040 --> 47:23.920
one of its co-hosts Jack Graham the job is educating the audience in how you say these

47:23.920 --> 47:30.000
things now it's it's like an it's like a course in not just the the ideology but in the how you

47:30.000 --> 47:34.560
present that ideology aesthetically now if you listen to enough of this stuff you imbibe this

47:34.560 --> 47:39.760
you learn how to say it I spend a lot of time going over Elijah Shafer in this video and well

47:39.760 --> 47:44.720
yeah I think he sucks I also want to highlight how his success is not purely a product of his

47:44.720 --> 47:49.600
own talents he was discovered by people with far more power than he and then given a platform to

47:49.600 --> 47:54.080
broadcast his beliefs because those are the sorts of beliefs that these people want to shape the

47:54.080 --> 48:00.640
public discourse as for who they are in this case he was hired by religious conservative Glenn Beck

48:00.640 --> 48:05.120
who rose to prominence because he tapped into a religious rights anti-left-wing sentiment

48:05.120 --> 48:10.560
something that was cultivated over decades by conservative politics Elijah Shafer will not be

48:10.640 --> 48:15.600
the last of these guys to appear this is a system designed to weaponize religious conservatism

48:15.600 --> 48:21.120
against the left and to advance a broader right-wing agenda it's one that's dependent on bringing in

48:21.120 --> 48:27.200
voices who espouse a specific worldview and then networking together to overall push this greater

48:27.200 --> 48:32.640
message of religious conservatism and what Shafer might be learning now is that that system

48:32.640 --> 48:38.400
doesn't care about him it just finds him useful while I was working on this video Shafer's co-host

48:38.400 --> 48:43.920
on You Are Here Sydney Watson decided to leave the show while Watson will continue on with Blaize

48:43.920 --> 48:49.360
Media it seems she will not be working alongside Shafer anymore Shafer's reaction on twitter was

48:50.080 --> 48:56.320
not great shortly afterwards Shafer made a tweet about Mormons Mormons are not Christians very nice

48:56.320 --> 49:02.560
people love them much of my family are LDS but they are going to hell not followers of truth

49:02.560 --> 49:07.760
makes me sad but can't deny the gospel I struggle in many ways too so can't condemn

49:08.320 --> 49:13.280
but can't pretend their faith isn't already condemned this got a response from Elijah

49:13.280 --> 49:20.560
Shafer's very Mormon boss Glen Beck Elijah thank goodness you know the truth assuming I'm one of

49:20.560 --> 49:25.680
the many nice people who the Lord has made clear to you is condemned I just need to know if you

49:25.680 --> 49:31.280
still want a guy who is going to hell as a mentor Shafer effectively doubled down on his initial

49:31.280 --> 49:36.560
tweet and I can't imagine saying your boss is going to hell is the best career move but this

49:36.560 --> 49:40.400
isn't new for Shafer he's spoken many times about how he's gotten in trouble for comments in the

49:40.400 --> 49:45.120
past and how he ruffles feathers with his brazen attitude he even has this habit of making these

49:45.120 --> 49:50.560
really sad comments about how he's all alone and has lost so many of his friends yeah and now I have

49:50.560 --> 49:56.560
like one friend and it's Pamela Anderson my life that she gives me pleasure about but no but I just

49:56.560 --> 50:00.560
meant genuinely as a joke like I was like I've just I've lost pretty much everybody in the last

50:00.560 --> 50:05.200
year and I you know so I'm just where I'm at now it's just me in my little home studio and here we

50:05.200 --> 50:11.120
are but but the my slightly offensive like absolutely killing it and all my social like

50:11.120 --> 50:14.560
everything's just growing and doing well so like I'm like I've never been doing better financially

50:14.560 --> 50:18.800
Shafer has some skill in the game he's playing but maybe it's not enough to create a meaningful

50:18.800 --> 50:23.680
career and maybe he'll burn out a few short years after starting and then he'll be replaced by the

50:23.680 --> 50:28.880
next guy willing to say and do all the things Shafer does though perhaps not quite as earnestly

50:28.880 --> 50:33.440
after all it's not about the influencers it's about maintaining that system of power that is

50:33.440 --> 50:39.200
animated in part by Christian nationalism and that system of power was never built for the

50:39.200 --> 50:45.280
people at the very bottom but rather the people at the very top this video could not have been

50:45.280 --> 50:51.040
completed without the very helpful assistance of Daniel Harper the other co-host of the I Don't

50:51.040 --> 50:56.880
Speak German podcast I highly recommend it they've done several videos touching on people like Shafer

50:56.880 --> 51:02.960
but they specialize on a lot of far right figures shedding light on some really dark disturbing

51:02.960 --> 51:07.520
corners of the internet so if you enjoy those sorts of videos uh about those kinds of topics

51:07.520 --> 51:12.000
on my channel I very much recommend checking out their podcast it's really well done and has a lot

51:12.000 --> 51:17.520
of information you often won't be hearing anywhere else if you'd like to see more videos like this
