1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,360
This video was originally recorded on December 28th.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,120
Things clearly have changed a lot,

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,840
especially with the events that happened on January 6th

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,140
in Washington, D.C.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:13,080
I recorded several minutes

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,020
and placed them at the end of this video.

7
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:17,760
The rest of the video is as it was originally recorded,

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,800
and I hope the conclusion will tie it together

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,160
in a way that makes sense.

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,360
The world is weird, it makes me mad,

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,400
but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,600
When someone tunes into a news commentary channel,

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,640
they're expecting two different things,

14
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:34,960
to learn about the news of the day

15
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,000
and be provided with a context in which to understand it.

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,800
This is the basis for most YouTube channels

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,200
that comment on the news.

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
They're all structured the same way,

19
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,760
with a brief rundown of the story and then some analysis.

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,600
Depending on the political leanings of the channel,

21
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,040
you can get news from whatever point on the political spectrum

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,880
you might be interested in hearing from.

23
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,920
And correspondingly, their choice of stories

24
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,080
and how they're presented will reflect that worldview.

25
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,160
It's true of every political YouTube channel,

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,000
this one included.

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're never getting the capital T truth about anything,

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,520
rather you're getting the perspective

29
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,000
of the person speaking.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,760
Which brings us to Tim Pool.

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,480
Across his three YouTube channels,

32
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,560
he publishes multiple videos daily.

33
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,240
This can mean he uploads six or seven different videos

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,400
from 10 to 30 minutes in length on his main two channels,

35
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,280
Tim Pool and Timcast,

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,600
and videos that can stretch on for four hours

37
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:25,160
on his Timcast IRL channel.

38
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,840
Tim Pool's main two channels focused exclusively

39
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,040
on his own perspective on the news of the day.

40
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,760
And his perspective provides his audience

41
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,800
with a selection of news stories and analysis

42
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,400
that makes them less informed

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,360
after having watched one or more of his videos.

44
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,480
Here's a quick example.

45
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,320
Back in mid November,

46
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,360
the United States was seeing another surge

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,560
in COVID infections.

48
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,480
Now imagine you're someone who goes to Tim's channel

49
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,360
looking for the latest update on COVID.

50
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,320
On November 17th, 2020,

51
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,760
you would find a video titled,

52
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,240
stores stripped as COVID lockdown sparks panic.

53
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,440
Tucker Carlson warns of the great reset.

54
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,480
The main thrust of this video is some commentary

55
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,360
about how the threat of COVID is overblown,

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,280
tests may not be trustworthy,

57
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,680
and that there's some kind of nefarious plot

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
with the elites trying to reshape society.

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,280
Here's how Tim breaks down

60
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,280
the increasing number of COVID cases.

61
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,720
Number of US deaths per day has not spiked.

62
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,680
Look at where it was early on.

63
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,960
And now it's actually, there's a spike right here.

64
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,040
It's a little spike.

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,080
It's going up and we're worried about that.

66
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:28,480
And I can understand saying we need to take precautions

67
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,320
to prevent this spike from skyrocketing,

68
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,320
but take a look at cases.

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,320
Number of new infections per day is higher

70
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,640
than it's ever been,

71
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,800
but the death rate is way, way, way down.

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,520
I'm not convinced we're facing extreme circumstances just yet.

73
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,040
It makes no sense to destroy the lives of so many people.

74
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,320
Number of cases are going up,

75
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,960
but since deaths remained low,

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,080
Tim says the danger is being overblown.

77
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,280
He repeated this in a November 18th video

78
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,920
titled, Protests Overforced, Vaccinations Erupt,

79
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,080
Democrats Openly Violate Lockdown, Dark Winter is Coming.

80
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,760
That's really ominous.

81
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,240
Right now, the fact we can point out

82
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,960
is that hospitalizations are not going up

83
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,960
and deaths are only spiked a little bit,

84
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,040
not as bad as it was.

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
It went up and then it went back down.

86
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
Now let's compare this to some commentary

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,360
from another commentator, Sam Seder,

88
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,880
in a video a few days prior, November 13th,

89
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:23,720
titled, Sam Breaks Down the Startly New COVID Numbers.

90
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,320
Hospitalizations and deaths are lagging indicators.

91
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:32,120
So what's going on today in terms of infections

92
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,160
is going to implicate hospitalizations

93
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,400
two to three weeks from now.

94
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,080
It's gonna be a really tragic lesson

95
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:44,080
for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.

96
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,920
This is not to mention, you know,

97
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,960
the implications, long-term implications

98
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,440
for a lot of people of getting COVID.

99
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,760
It is, we're just watching this slow motion tragedy.

100
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,360
A very different prognosis.

101
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,480
What Tim sees as alarmism orchestrated

102
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,720
by a group of elites to enact their agenda,

103
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,360
Sam presents as a real danger

104
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,600
that will lead to higher death rates in the near future.

105
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,960
With the benefit of hindsight,

106
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,520
we can very easily see who got this one right.

107
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Throughout December, deaths have been skyrocketing

108
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,640
in the United States,

109
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,920
with reports now regularly reaching over 3,000 a day.

110
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,760
And this isn't a case of a commentator having psychic powers.

111
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,520
It's been well known for a while that,

112
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:23,520
when it comes to indicators on the severity of the COVID crisis,

113
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
deaths are a lagging indicator,

114
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,240
typically lagging behind infections.

115
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,440
That's because after being diagnosed with COVID,

116
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,640
people usually have two weeks before the symptoms get serious.

117
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,360
So if there's an increase in the number of cases being reported,

118
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,720
a spike in the number of deaths

119
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,840
is likely to occur a few weeks later.

120
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
The fact that Tim looked at both numbers

121
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,280
of infections and number of deaths on the same day

122
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,600
without mentioning this fact,

123
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,040
and if anything providing commentary

124
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,000
that ran contrary to the idea that a big spike was coming,

125
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
left his audience misinformed about the danger of COVID-19.

126
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,720
This is one small example of how Tim keeps his audience ignorant.

127
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,680
In a look at the sources used by Tim Pool

128
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,560
from a sample of his videos in 2020,

129
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,960
the numbers reveal that the vast majority of Tim Pool's sources

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,920
are right-wing,

131
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,440
accounting for 59% of the sources he uses in his videos.

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,400
But even more than that, Tim's attitudes

133
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,480
towards the media sources he uses

134
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,880
and the sources he presents

135
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,920
reveals even more about his commentary.

136
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,800
Here's an example of how Tim speaks about the mainstream media.

137
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,200
The mainstream media has been lying to them

138
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,200
and covering up these stories.

139
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,000
They don't get it.

140
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,480
How insane is it?

141
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,320
When he speaks about right-wing media,

142
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,960
his tone quickly shifts.

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,160
For example, here are some comments he made about right-wing populist Tucker Carlson.

144
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,360
Tucker Carlson has once again saved the world.

145
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,960
Yes, I'm being a bit tongue-in-cheek,

146
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,440
but to a certain extent,

147
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,400
you could say Tucker Carlson literally saved the world.

148
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,960
Wow, okay.

149
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,120
This reveals a very clear bias towards right-wing media,

150
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,880
one that colors Tim's commentary,

151
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,600
giving it a distinctly right-wing slant.

152
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,040
He'll accuse the far-left media, at least in his mind,

153
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,960
of taking every opportunity to advance its agenda,

154
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,240
whereas Tucker Carlson, who is at the very least

155
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,920
also pushing an agenda, is some kind of savior.

156
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,400
When you take that into consideration,

157
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,920
it's not surprising that most of the new stories he presents

158
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,160
come from a right-wing perspective.

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,240
This reliance on right-wing media

160
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,680
has led Tim to advance some questionable right-wing narratives,

161
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,840
most recently pushing the idea that Donald Trump

162
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,320
has a chance of retaining his presidency.

163
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,440
In the days following the November 3rd, 2020 federal election,

164
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,720
it became increasingly clear that Joe Biden

165
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,800
would be declared the next president-elect.

166
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,600
There's a fun supercut of all the times Tim pull predicted

167
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:37,880
a landslide victory for Republicans in that very election.

168
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,760
No amount of mail-in ballots will matter.

169
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,600
If Trump gets 537 or 36, or even 538,

170
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,240
every single electoral vote.

171
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,600
We all know Joe Biden will lose.

172
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,880
Like, let's be real, man.

173
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,400
As I've stated a million and one times,

174
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,560
Donald Trump's gonna win.

175
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,960
The Republicans are gonna sweep.

176
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,960
Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden has defeated Donald Trump.

177
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,440
Everything I've told you will be wrong

178
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,240
and completely meaningless.

179
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,680
So keep that in mind.

180
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,240
Since then, Tim has argued that he was only presenting

181
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,920
a hypothetical based on a story he read

182
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,760
and that he didn't think this was a likely outcome.

183
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,960
In the astronomical event that Donald Trump

184
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,280
somehow pulls off a triple hat trick in these states,

185
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,640
I'm gonna play that crab dancing song, Bagatcha, uh-huh.

186
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,240
Although it's not really what I meant back in the day,

187
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,800
but you know, several months ago when I was like,

188
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,840
I think this will lend itself

189
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,560
to a Donald Trump landslide victory.

190
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,200
As a reminder, he had made this prediction many, many times

191
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,480
and certainly within two months before the election.

192
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,480
I'll tell you what I think's gonna happen.

193
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,520
I think they're cheating.

194
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,000
I think Trump's gonna landslide.

195
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,920
I think Trump would have had a landslide no matter what.

196
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,480
I think the polls are fake.

197
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,760
And I think what's happening now is Trump's gonna win

198
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,800
and they're gonna say, ah, but he didn't really win.

199
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
Now that we've seen those fun clips,

200
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,480
let's talk about coping.

201
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,240
While some people are very happy to point out

202
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,000
that Tim is coping over being wrong in his predictions,

203
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,740
this is missing the more important part

204
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:00,440
of what's going on with Tim's channel.

205
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,640
His viewers don't turn in to watch him get high on copium.

206
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,000
They're going there for a fix themselves.

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,440
You see, Tim isn't a user.

208
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,400
He's a copium dealer.

209
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,320
Here's what I mean.

210
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,160
Although a Biden victory was increasingly obvious

211
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,840
following the days of the election as the votes were counted

212
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,320
and he had a clear lead,

213
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,940
you wouldn't know it looking at the titles

214
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:22,000
of many of Tim Poole's videos.

215
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,300
They read, Wisconsin lawmaker says electoral college

216
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:29,880
should reject results paving way for Trump win.

217
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:33,680
Major victory for GOP, judge rules mail-in voting

218
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,540
likely unconstitutional.

219
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,400
Trump may win or block PA.

220
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,820
Leftists and Democrats start panicking

221
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,400
as they realize Trump is actually winning

222
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,040
political victories.

223
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,160
These headlines are dripping with a Trump-flavored sweat

224
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,780
beckoning any of his supporters for a quick taste

225
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,640
of this delicious copium

226
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,280
with the promise that things are swinging in Trump's favor

227
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,380
that hope still lives on.

228
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:02,160
When it comes to the actual contents of these videos,

229
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,900
I would be misrepresenting them if I didn't mention that.

230
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,240
Tim believes that these various efforts

231
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:10,200
to win Trump the presidency are long shots.

232
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,440
He certainly does say that quite a bit,

233
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,720
but there's always a but.

234
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,960
I don't think it's very likely that Trump pulls this off.

235
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,480
I really, really don't, but he's a trying

236
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,600
and his argument seems to make sense.

237
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,120
You know, Joe Biden is gonna win this one,

238
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,460
but this is where it gets crazy.

239
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,000
So it may seem astronomical that Trump actually succeeds,

240
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,480
but he's gaining ground

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,860
in every place he needs to gain ground.

242
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,840
That's the best way to put it.

243
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,520
I've said over and over again

244
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,200
that it seems that the likely that Trump

245
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,640
actually pulls off some victory here is astronomical,

246
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
but possible.

247
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,440
And Tim was constantly pushing back

248
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,980
when it would be clear that Joe Biden

249
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:48,800
could be safely declared the president-elect.

250
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,520
At first he was saying it was December 14th

251
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,320
when the electoral college voted.

252
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,060
Until we get to this point

253
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,580
where we have certified results on the 14th,

254
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,260
then it was January 6th

255
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,340
when the results are tabulated by the vice president.

256
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:03,180
The vice president becomes president-elect

257
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,940
as far as I can tell on January 6th.

258
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,380
I was wrong before, I thought it was the 14th.

259
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:11,940
And then January 20th, the date of inauguration itself.

260
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,420
The only date that matters is January 20th

261
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,700
as per the constitution.

262
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,880
The impression this creates in the minds of his viewers

263
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,980
is that there might be something to this whole Trump comeback,

264
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,360
that there's a chance it could work.

265
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,380
Even though Tim personally doesn't believe it,

266
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,500
he's always quick to mention his opinion

267
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,100
but it doesn't really matter.

268
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,140
But it doesn't matter what I think as I often say.

269
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,860
Tim believes it's his job to deliver the news

270
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,900
and let his audience make of it what they will.

271
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:38,120
People wanna say Trump is gonna lose, fine, that's for them.

272
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,440
That's not what I do, okay?

273
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,300
I try to be rational, reasonable,

274
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,380
understand what's happening and tell you.

275
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,060
But it's the news he's choosing to deliver that matters.

276
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,520
Dozens of his videos were devoted to every morsel

277
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,420
of a chance he could spot of Donald Trump

278
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,360
overturning the results of the election.

279
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,980
Something that any Trump friend would be desperate to hear.

280
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,860
Part of delivering the copia means

281
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,540
not just choosing the right sources or spectacles

282
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,540
but also choosing the right stories.

283
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,680
The ones that will keep his audience hopeful

284
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,180
and keep them watching.

285
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:08,360
It isn't surprising to find dozens of comments

286
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,980
under his videos from desperate Trump fans.

287
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Here are a few examples.

288
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,260
As a non-American,

289
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,260
I have to say Americans should never back down.

290
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,700
The future of the world and freedom

291
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
depend on Trump's winning.

292
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,480
We don't care about mass riots.

293
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,820
We care about getting it right and not turning into China.

294
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,260
Trump won PA by a landslide, it's clear.

295
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,180
Democrat sloppy cheating is so obvious.

296
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,640
It's legitimately disgusting

297
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,420
and only proves we live in a banana republic.

298
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,220
And Tim reinforces the actions

299
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,300
of Trump supporters at every turn.

300
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,140
If you're a Trump supporter,

301
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,080
you probably believe he's gonna do it.

302
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,900
While the left is saying Trump will lose

303
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,640
and the right is saying Trump will win.

304
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,100
There's rational moderate people saying like,

305
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,140
Trump might win, okay?

306
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,780
And that's how you make the copia.

307
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,300
Tim himself acknowledges how remote the chances are,

308
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:58,460
but by fixating on every minor development

309
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,780
and its implications,

310
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,620
he keeps hope alive in Trump supporters.

311
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,140
All the while hiding behind the idea

312
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,700
that he's only talking about something possible,

313
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,380
not necessarily something probable.

314
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,500
But when he says that,

315
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,420
he isn't doing it to inform his audience

316
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,100
of the realistic possibilities.

317
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,380
He's doing that to protect his own credibility.

318
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,140
If he was providing adequate commentary for these stories,

319
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,620
he would be highlighting how incredibly remote

320
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:23,500
and absurd it is to think that these will actually happen.

321
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,860
All of these stories are nonsense.

322
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:28,100
And while I could claim the benefit of hindsight

323
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,380
saying they wouldn't work out,

324
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:32,140
even at the time these were absurd long shots,

325
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:34,420
meant to just pump out video after video

326
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,500
presenting them as the next big chance

327
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,900
or a possible opportunity

328
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,100
for a change in the outcome of the election,

329
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
even with the little disclaimers,

330
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,820
simply isn't giving his audience an accurate depiction

331
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,500
of what's happening in the world.

332
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,620
It's only giving them false hope.

333
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:50,440
The reaction from his audience makes it clear

334
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,300
that anyone tuning into these videos

335
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,260
is doing so to hear about how Trump

336
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:57,700
might still get a second term in 2021.

337
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,220
And just to nail this point home a little bit harder,

338
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:03,180
I wanna highlight the short saga of the Texas lawsuit,

339
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:04,980
which would supposedly overturn the results

340
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,500
in several states Trump had lost during the election.

341
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,300
Tim got on the ground floor with this story

342
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,160
before it had been thoroughly undermined

343
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,700
by the mainstream media.

344
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,500
On Twitter, Tim expects patience on this revelation,

345
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,220
claiming that before making any statements on this new case,

346
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,540
we should wait and see how the Supreme Court ruled on it.

347
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,620
That same day, he released a video titled,

348
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,400
Texas just nuked Democrats from orbit

349
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,140
with SCOTUS lawsuit calling election unconstitutional.

350
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,540
Because Tim was lurking late at night,

351
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:33,940
this video came out early in the life cycle of this story

352
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:36,660
before the mainstream media had torn this story to pieces.

353
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,940
And blissfully ignorant of the real possibilities

354
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,800
of this working out, they were actually really low,

355
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,500
Tim is breathless in describing it.

356
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,780
They're probably gonna win this one, and this is huge.

357
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,320
This is gonna change the outcome of the election.

358
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,640
In my opinion, we'll see.

359
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,600
A few days later, though,

360
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,520
when the Supreme Court dismissed the case,

361
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:56,160
Tim takes a different tone in the video.

362
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,560
Texas GOP calls for new union of states

363
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,040
as SCOTUS denies lawsuit disputing election.

364
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,260
It's not over.

365
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,520
I'll tell ya, it is not over until Joe Biden

366
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:10,640
is in the White House, and even then, it might not end.

367
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:11,600
They don't get it.

368
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,400
They don't understand what's happening.

369
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,840
Tim went out on a limb for this story, and he got burnt.

370
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:19,400
It ended up going nowhere and doing nothing,

371
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,800
like every attempt Trump and his team have made

372
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,880
to change the results of the election.

373
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,480
But Tim can't have his audience walking away

374
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,760
from his videos feeling dejected and defeated,

375
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,300
and so he pushes the deadline

376
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,240
of when things will be over to never.

377
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,280
Things will never be over.

378
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:37,360
Trump supporters will never accept this election,

379
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,280
and soon, we're gonna have a civil war.

380
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,660
Tim's rule as copium dealers should be understood

381
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:46,360
as broadly anti-left and specifically pro-Trump.

382
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,660
That is to say, he's more likely to produce content

383
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,280
that attacks left-wing social views and politicians,

384
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,120
and more likely to defend right-wing ones

385
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,920
as they relate specifically to Donald Trump.

386
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,960
That isn't to say he never does the opposite

387
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,240
of either of those things.

388
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,200
It's just highly unlikely he'll either title a video

389
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,600
or spend most of his time praising the left

390
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,580
or criticizing Donald Trump.

391
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,840
What's quite striking is how protective he is

392
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,960
of Trump in general, especially the critiques

393
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,160
that come from the left.

394
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,680
Some of the better examples of this

395
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,160
are in the Timcast IRL channel,

396
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,200
where he has informal conversations with guests

397
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,800
and happened to invite individuals

398
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,220
who were to the left of him.

399
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,920
In the first case, on October 27th, 2020,

400
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,440
Tim spoke with YouTube political streaming personality, Bosch,

401
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,060
when speaking about Trump's response to the COVID pandemic.

402
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:32,880
Tim has a very strange defense of Trump's response.

403
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,280
We know Trump was given information and then lied about it.

404
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,760
And that's your opinion is?

405
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,680
That's not an opinion.

406
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,920
Yes, no, no, no, no, I'm saying,

407
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,720
and your opinion is he shouldn't have,

408
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,120
and mine is, I don't know,

409
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,080
maybe there would have been a panic, maybe there wouldn't.

410
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,600
I can't help but thank Tim's feelings

411
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,040
on government officials lying to the American public

412
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,360
has changed since this video came out.

413
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,160
Here's an example from a video less than three months later.

414
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,720
Anthony Fauci says, don't worry,

415
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,960
we can accomplish herd immunity.

416
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,560
And then he keeps moving the goalposts.

417
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,840
So he was lying the whole time.

418
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,200
That's authoritarianism.

419
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,920
The idea that you're too stupid as an individual,

420
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,160
that your rights don't matter

421
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,560
and that we should withhold information from you

422
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,400
because we're smarter than you.

423
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,360
Tim hates lying now,

424
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,080
or maybe it's only when someone

425
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,720
other than Trump is doing it.

426
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,560
And for the record, Fauci's reason

427
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,200
for changing the required herd immunity projection

428
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,120
was new scientific information

429
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,600
and his message is being tailored

430
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,960
to encourage as many Americans as possible

431
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,400
to take the vaccine.

432
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,880
It's a lot more complicated than branding Fauci a liar.

433
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,240
Anyway, let's get back to the conversation with Vosch.

434
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,920
What I'm trying to talk about is the totality of evidence

435
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:38,520
that he has mishandled this pandemic.

436
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,600
And it's interesting to me

437
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,000
that you were extremely unwilling to criticize him for that.

438
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,480
Because what's the alternative?

439
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,320
The alternative.

440
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,560
What would have happened in any other circumstance

441
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,720
where we have no control group?

442
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,800
What am I supposed to say?

443
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,880
Well, the Trump would have backflip and saved a life.

444
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,560
How many would have had to have died

445
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,160
before you would criticize him?

446
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,920
I don't know.

447
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,760
Give me a number.

448
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,600
We don't know.

449
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,120
Wait, so you could have led a million?

450
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,840
So what you're telling me is that we have no idea

451
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,560
what would have happened if Trump did anything else.

452
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,840
And now we're supposed to make a determination.

453
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,120
The idea that you can't criticize

454
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,080
the Trump administration response

455
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,840
because we don't know for certain what the outcomes

456
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,080
of other courses of actions would be

457
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,480
deflates literally any criticism

458
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,720
someone can have for a past action.

459
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,680
And when Tim is confronted on this point,

460
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,080
his response is to point out

461
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:26,840
how he hasn't criticized Nancy Pelosi.

462
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,200
You are taking the choice to defend Trump.

463
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,760
You are the partisan here.

464
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,080
You're not a distanced anti-authoritarian.

465
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,520
You are standing with him.

466
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,280
And you are saying, yes, I am anti-authoritarian.

467
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,680
I am anti-establishment.

468
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,600
But also, we don't know if him

469
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,440
lying to the American people was bad.

470
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:43,440
It could have caused a panic.

471
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

472
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:45,920
Can I make a video right now

473
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,720
where I just scream about Nancy Pelosi

474
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,640
causing all of the problems?

475
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
I haven't done that.

476
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,040
Although still strange,

477
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,560
the idea that he's not trying to attack either side

478
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,600
for the pandemic response,

479
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,240
this would be a consistent line of reasoning

480
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,280
if we hadn't heard Tim say this a few minutes earlier.

481
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,800
We had several governors praise Trump for his response

482
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,360
in, I think it was May.

483
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,200
Look, look, look.

484
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,680
A quarter of the deaths from COVID worldwide

485
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,920
in a country with four percent.

486
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,520
Nursing homes where the governors

487
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,800
of Democrat controlled states put sick people killing.

488
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,040
Wait, wait, wait, again, that's not good.

489
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,920
I feel like we're engaging in what aboutism, right?

490
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,720
We see that Tim is quite willing to blame Democrats

491
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,200
when it comes to defending the Trump administration.

492
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,120
But whenever Vosch had criticisms

493
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,840
for the Democrats throughout the stream,

494
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,360
Tim never felt the urge to balance out those

495
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,680
with a critique of Trump

496
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,720
or praising the Democrats in any way, shape, or form.

497
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,640
To be fair, in this conversation,

498
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,160
Tim lets criticism of Trump get some air

499
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,960
and offers a few himself.

500
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,280
I think Trump has very serious problems.

501
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,800
I think he lies often.

502
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,560
I think he's a blaggart.

503
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,080
He boasts, he won't shut up.

504
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,360
And I think most people know he's got a mouth

505
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,000
that he couldn't stop blabbing to save his own campaign.

506
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,720
I think he caused a lot of his own problems.

507
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,520
And there is an actual really great argument

508
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,680
that he should have been honest with the American people.

509
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,840
On the hours upon hours of Tim Pool content,

510
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:05,160
I watched to research this video.

511
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,080
That clip was the hardest I saw him go on Donald Trump.

512
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,240
We can see this behavior again in the conversation

513
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:14,120
with another political streaming personality, Destiny,

514
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,120
on December 3rd of the same year.

515
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,320
And Bolivia, when he kept trying to recognize-

516
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,280
Democrats did that too.

517
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,120
Regardless-

518
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,160
These conversations are especially revelatory

519
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,040
as we see Tim is often unable to counter

520
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,400
the arguments put against him

521
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
without digging into a rolodex of anecdotes

522
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,680
he seems to have citing fringe stories

523
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,200
and personal experiences,

524
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,080
counting on the fact that his guest

525
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
either hasn't heard of those stories

526
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,240
or doesn't have personal experiences

527
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,120
that run contrary to his.

528
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,040
It's very difficult to present academic research,

529
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,920
statistics, or other facts

530
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,800
to only hear them countered by some strange anecdote

531
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,120
you know few details of

532
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,400
and are only hearing from a single source.

533
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,720
And this is where Tim feels most comfortable,

534
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,160
not only in these discussions,

535
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,960
but all his videos thrive on this specific presentation

536
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,600
of reoccurring oddball stories he repeats endlessly.

537
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,880
And we can see what happens

538
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,560
when one of Tim's faulty claims is checked in real time.

539
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,880
He even said, we want to pressure you

540
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,280
so that you can make memories.

541
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,200
And do you remember when he said that, right?

542
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,480
He said, we want you to, you know,

543
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,320
when we pressure you this way,

544
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,520
then you can form memories.

545
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,360
I'm pretty sure exactly what he said was that

546
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,200
when we pressure you,

547
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,160
you're more likely to remember what actually happened

548
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,000
is what he said.

549
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,920
That under some pressure,

550
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,520
the truth will come out or whatever it was.

551
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
Ultimately, I think the argument is kind of pointless

552
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:25,960
on this one guy. Sure.

553
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,760
He moves on instantly.

554
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:28,920
And before moving on myself,

555
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,040
there's one comment I can't leave alone

556
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,560
from these conversations.

557
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,160
I was told in a matter of speaking to lie

558
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,520
on more than one occasion,

559
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,840
that if there is a certain bit of news reporting,

560
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,920
that's true, but would be offensive to our audience.

561
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,280
We don't report it.

562
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,880
We side with the audience.

563
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,280
That's what I was told to do.

564
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,920
Can you give me like a, not a specific example,

565
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,200
but like, what's like a general example of that?

566
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,040
What do you mean by that?

567
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,520
Let's say there's two guys in the street,

568
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,760
Proud Boy and Antifa.

569
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,040
And Antifa walks up and punches the Proud Boy in the face.

570
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,840
If I reported that Antifa punched a Proud Boy in the face,

571
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,480
that would be offensive to our audience.

572
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,320
We don't report it.

573
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,240
We have to side with the audience,

574
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,360
which means when the Proud Boy got back up

575
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,560
and punched Antifa back, that's what we report.

576
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:08,520
To hear this criticism from Tim,

577
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,840
who so fiercely sides with his own audience

578
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,480
and their absolute love of Trump is ridiculous.

579
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,800
Not that Tim acknowledges the pro-Trump elements

580
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,200
in his audience, as we can see here.

581
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,320
With this audience, I noticed,

582
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,320
I don't want to be too general,

583
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,760
but when I start to dump on Trump,

584
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,080
if I just start to insult him,

585
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,600
people get really angry at the other stuff I say

586
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,880
in the conversation.

587
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,440
If I don't trash Trump, I've noticed it, a trend,

588
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,400
because a lot of people that watch this show

589
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,920
seem to love him.

590
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,480
Well, you're looking at the comments.

591
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,760
I look at the comments, I'm talking about the text comments.

592
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,000
Yup, that's why a lot of the comments

593
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,880
are making fun of me quite a bit as well, especially now.

594
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,880
The idea that comments under his videos,

595
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,520
highly voted up ones no less,

596
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,000
are somehow not representative of his audience

597
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,440
is ridiculous.

598
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,600
His claim of controversy driving their popularity

599
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,760
is misleading.

600
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,080
And all of this brings me to the reason

601
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,080
I wanted to make this video in the first place.

602
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,600
I got a bit annoyed when I saw Tim Pool

603
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:06,600
starting to produce videos that promote vaccine skepticism.

604
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,200
Let's quote one thing out of the way,

605
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,040
he said,

606
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,880
he said,

607
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,720
he said,

608
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,560
he said,

609
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,400
he said,

610
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,240
he said,

611
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,080
he said,

612
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,920
he said,

613
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,760
he said,

614
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,600
he said,

615
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,400
he said,

616
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,240
he said,

617
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,080
he said,

618
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:19,920
he said,

619
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,760
he said,

620
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,600
he said,

621
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,440
he said,

622
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,280
he said,

623
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,120
he said,

624
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,040
right off the bat.

625
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:29,400
It would be wrong to call Tim an anti-vaxxer,

626
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,320
and he quite clearly states he thinks

627
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,800
there's probably nothing wrong with taking any vaccine

628
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,840
for the COVID-19 virus.

629
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,680
But,

630
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,280
and if you were paying attention in this video,

631
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,500
you knew there would be a but,

632
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,760
Tim is quite willing to play into the paranoia

633
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:42,880
around the vaccine,

634
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,580
including using techniques

635
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,820
that are common among anti-vaxxers.

636
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:49,400
In the December 17th, 2020 video titled,

637
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,680
Viral Video Shows Nurse Vaccination Syringe

638
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,900
was empty.

639
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:57,020
Media is the cause of vaccine fear mongering.

640
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,340
I think the mainstream media,

641
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,600
these news outlets are trying to freak us out

642
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,440
about the vaccine.

643
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,400
I mean it.

644
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,080
Tim is supposedly calling out the media

645
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,500
for creating skepticism about the vaccine.

646
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,020
Ironically, this is something he does in this very video.

647
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:14,200
Look, you have these PR events or whatever.

648
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,980
We don't need them.

649
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,120
It's the weirdest thing to me.

650
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,680
We have flu shots every year.

651
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,080
You tell people there's a flu shot,

652
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,600
have at it, we don't care.

653
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,320
The fact that Tim compares this to getting the flu shot

654
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,400
as if millions of people haven't had their lives

655
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
completely changed by this pandemic

656
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,360
demonstrates how he really likes to

657
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,920
downplay the impact this virus is having.

658
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,920
It's sort of true whenever he talks about the pandemic.

659
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,700
He never mentions that the virus itself is dangerous.

660
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:43,920
He mostly gets angry at lockdowns or dancing nurses.

661
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,960
I look at that and I get angry.

662
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,600
The first bit of evidence Tim shows us

663
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,640
is a news story from El Paso

664
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,760
about a local news report showing a nurse

665
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,360
receiving the vaccine,

666
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,320
but it appears the syringes plunger

667
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,860
had already been pushed in.

668
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,200
An event that, by the way,

669
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,480
had five different people receive the vaccine.

670
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,560
Why this story is getting any kind of coverage

671
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,080
is kind of weird.

672
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,640
There are hundreds of these stories out there,

673
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,620
especially on local news channels.

674
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,820
They want to present some positive developments

675
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,760
on this year-long pandemic.

676
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,280
This non-story got traction

677
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,920
because it was spread on social media as suspect.

678
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,720
Even if the event had been botched,

679
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,400
this speaks less to the efficacy of the vaccine

680
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,300
and more to the people who set up this event.

681
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,200
The dude literally did not receive a vaccine.

682
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,400
I'm casting the PR event in a negative light.

683
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,240
Oh, hey, Tim, got this one right.

684
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:34,520
And he wants to assure people that the vaccine is fine.

685
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,360
But there's always a but, isn't there?

686
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,320
This is the illusion of nuance

687
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,840
Tim loves to introduce to his audience.

688
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,880
But there can be side effects.

689
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,520
That's a fact, and you really should understand.

690
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,540
Here's an example of him providing

691
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,560
supposedly reasonable concerns about the vaccine.

692
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,360
There have been people who developed Bell's Palsy

693
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,760
after getting the vaccine.

694
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,880
They're saying, but it's not any different

695
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:02,040
than the natural statistics on people getting Bell's Palsy.

696
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,480
The issue is there's still the correlation.

697
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,000
There is no issue though.

698
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,200
For the 43,000 people who received the Pfizer vaccine,

699
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,880
four developed Bell's Palsy.

700
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,920
And of the 30,000 in the Moderna group,

701
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,800
three reported some degree of facial paralysis,

702
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,320
a symptom of Bell's Palsy.

703
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,400
The standard rate of developing some kind

704
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,240
of partial facial paralysis within the United States

705
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,520
is one in 10,000.

706
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,960
In other words, when Tim says there's a correlation

707
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,080
between receiving the vaccine and developing Bell's Palsy,

708
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,360
that isn't true.

709
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:33,200
A correlation would require the incidence

710
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,160
of partial facial paralysis to go up

711
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:37,360
after receiving the vaccine.

712
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,320
But since it stays the same,

713
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:42,040
there is no evidence of a correlation.

714
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:44,240
But I'm not a medical expert.

715
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,280
My basic understanding of math aside,

716
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,400
let's see what a medical expert says.

717
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,600
Here's a quote from Dr. Irene Kim,

718
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,680
assistant professor of head and neck surgery

719
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,800
and director of the Facial Nerve Center

720
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,640
in the Division of Facial Plastic Surgery at UCLA,

721
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,880
who echoes the FDA when she says,

722
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,040
the information we have is insufficient to say

723
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,760
that there is a causal relationship

724
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,960
between Bell's Palsy and the vaccine.

725
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,040
Back to Tim's video.

726
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,680
He overstates another side effect

727
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,600
when talking about anaphylaxis.

728
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,160
I believe anaphylaxis was a point,

729
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,840
I think it was a 0.685% probability.

730
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,280
So that's like one in 160 or so.

731
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,240
I'm not sure where he got the specific figure from.

732
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,400
When he tweeted about this,

733
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,080
he included a link to a Euronews article,

734
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,560
though the 0.685% number is nowhere to be found.

735
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:38,000
I suspect Tim is getting this rate of 0.685%

736
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,000
from the Pfizer study in which 0.63% of the 22,000 people

737
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,720
who received the vaccine reported hypersensitivity-related

738
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,600
adverse effects compared to the 0.51%

739
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,880
who received the placebo.

740
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,920
Most importantly, Pfizer said there were no cases

741
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,360
of anaphylaxis.

742
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,800
And to clarify what anaphylaxis is,

743
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,960
one definition I found describes it as,

744
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:03,200
a serious life-threatening allergic reaction.

745
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,160
This is the most serious type of allergic reaction

746
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:09,280
a person can get, and if you don't have an EpiPen

747
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,120
or something nearby, you can quite easily die.

748
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:16,360
Tim saying that one in 160 people who get the vaccine

749
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,160
will get anaphylaxis is completely absurd

750
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:22,440
and dangerously misleading.

751
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,400
Why can't we have a regular conversation about this?

752
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,720
There are side effects.

753
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,480
It shouldn't be mandatory.

754
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,840
How simple is that?

755
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Although Tim calls himself pro-vaccine,

756
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,680
overstating the side effects of vaccines

757
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,840
is a common tactic of anti-vaxxers.

758
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,760
Though the bigger point he makes in this video

759
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,680
is a libertarian-esque rant about how important it is

760
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,520
to have the choice on whether or not

761
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,560
to receive the vaccine, which is the real point

762
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,120
of this video, so he can say this.

763
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:51,600
Why is it that for years we can have people say things

764
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,440
like, I can't remember who it was,

765
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,800
there was some celebrity lady,

766
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,520
and she said, not in any way anti-vax,

767
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,200
just think people should have a choice

768
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
as to whether or not that they get vaccinated,

769
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,680
and they called her an anti-vaxxer.

770
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,600
The funny thing about this freedom argument

771
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,440
is that it's one that's been used by anti-vaxxers

772
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,240
going back over 100 years.

773
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,440
Here's an image from a pamphlet from 1885

774
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,160
talking about the supposed dangers of the smallpox vaccine.

775
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,160
You can see this echoed today with fear-mongering

776
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,400
about Bill Gates using vaccines to usher in a new world order

777
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,840
and that mandatory vaccines to have access

778
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,320
to public services, like public schools,

779
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,520
is taking away people's freedoms.

780
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,640
Tim's paranoia here is of the more mild sort,

781
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,280
where he fears every small business will be shut down

782
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,360
and people will be forced to get vaccinations

783
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,720
to shop at Walmart, something that seems unlikely.

784
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,760
He also talks about how he thinks people

785
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,560
should have the choice to homeschool their kids,

786
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,160
which, last I checked,

787
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,560
wasn't being outlawed in the United States.

788
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,880
And that's Tim's content all over.

789
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,240
He presents a reasonable take on vaccine

790
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,080
but pairs it with some subtle fear-mongering,

791
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,600
all the while taking potshots at the media.

792
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,680
Here's an example of how he projects anti-vaxx

793
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,920
talking points into the mouths of media figures.

794
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,560
This dude goes on TV

795
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,440
and says probably one of the stupidest things

796
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,840
I think anyone could have even said.

797
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,400
You know what, but maybe I'm wrong.

798
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Maybe he's just being honest.

799
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,560
He said something to the effect of,

800
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,480
even if you get the vaccine, you can still get COVID.

801
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,600
You can still get infected and you can still spread it.

802
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,960
So you gotta wear your mask.

803
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,800
You can't travel.

804
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,640
It's a misconception.

805
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,840
Wait, wait, wait, what?

806
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,120
Is this serious?

807
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,320
Tim refuses to do even the most basic research

808
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,880
on what the vaccine does.

809
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,000
The function of this vaccine is to prevent

810
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,080
the most serious symptoms of COVID,

811
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,160
symptoms that have killed hundreds of thousands

812
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,720
of people around the world.

813
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,120
What's unknown is how effective, if at all,

814
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:46,040
it will be in reducing the transmission of the virus.

815
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,640
So until herd immunity is reached,

816
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,600
it's important to maintain social distancing,

817
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,400
mask wearing, and limited travel.

818
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,440
This is not the same as saying

819
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,960
the vaccine doesn't work at all.

820
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
But instead of doing research to clarify

821
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,280
this Twitter comment, Tim would sooner pretend

822
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,160
someone in the media is saying the vaccine

823
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,560
just doesn't work, which gives him

824
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,640
the perfect excuse to say this.

825
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,320
So many people thought it was impossible.

826
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
Guess what?

827
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,160
Maybe it was.

828
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,120
Maybe this is the trial.

829
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,880
Like, we're desperate.

830
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,160
We got a lockdown.

831
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
People are scared.

832
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:19,280
Not conservatives, you know, but the left.

833
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:23,440
And so they brushed this out.

834
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,280
And it's as simple as that.

835
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,720
This is not the nuanced perspective

836
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,080
about the vaccine it pretends to be.

837
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,320
It certainly isn't full-on anti-vax content

838
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,180
the same way his pro-Trump videos

839
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,300
aren't full-on MAGA content.

840
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,420
It's a slightly more nuanced and restrained take.

841
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,700
But ultimately, it's pushing his audience

842
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,900
in the same direction, to be more skeptical

843
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:48,540
of the vaccine and to be more supportive of Trump.

844
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,300
One of the most reasonable things Tim says

845
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,900
in this video is that people should trust their doctors.

846
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,480
Advice I wholeheartedly support.

847
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:58,220
Does Tim ever wonder why he has highly upvoted

848
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,620
comments like these under his video?

849
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,380
Not getting vaccine.

850
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm not anti-vax.

851
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:07,020
I'm just not interested in being a guinea pig.

852
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,780
10 you years from now, there will be ads on TV.

853
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,320
Did you get COVID vaccine?

854
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,960
Join class action lawsuit today.

855
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,280
Don't you trust your doctors?

856
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,600
Um, no.

857
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,600
99.9% survival rate versus 2% severe side effects

858
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,120
with a 95% efficacy rate?

859
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:31,280
You decide which odds you're willing to take.

860
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,280
If this video was intended to reduce

861
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,720
people's fear of the vaccine, it obviously isn't working.

862
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,840
If anything, it's having the exact opposite effect.

863
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,020
And the cherry on top is how he turns this video

864
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:45,400
into another chance to defend Donald Trump.

865
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,680
I think these news outlets really want to undermine

866
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,640
our faith in the vaccine.

867
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,300
And a lot of people think the vaccine isn't safe,

868
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,280
but I'll tell you what, you wanna know

869
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,000
why I think they like doing this?

870
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,480
They hate Donald Trump.

871
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,080
Warp speed was Trump's initiative.

872
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,520
It worked, the vaccine came out.

873
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,540
Everyone's happy about it.

874
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,380
Because it wouldn't be a Tim Pool video

875
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,980
without another hit of that pro-Trump copium.

876
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,340
Taken on their own, very few single Tim Pool videos

877
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,820
are especially bad.

878
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:19,820
And what Tim's prolific amount of videos

879
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,100
create a media environment for his viewers

880
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,620
that keeps them happy.

881
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,200
And Tim has a tendency to speak out of both sides

882
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,380
of his mouth to the point of parody.

883
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:29,820
Far be it from me to question

884
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,060
an actual legal expert on this.

885
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,900
For sure.

886
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,180
10 seconds later.

887
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,580
But I have to question what he's saying.

888
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,380
And a clip like that encapsulates

889
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,960
one of the many problems with Tim Pool's content.

890
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,540
He speaks on topics he knows very little about

891
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,220
and the things he knows he often misrepresents.

892
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,260
Tim Pool's videos make his audience

893
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,420
more ignorant about the world.

894
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,260
This isn't my first Tim Pool video.

895
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:55,020
I focused on him specifically

896
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,700
and three other videos on this channel

897
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,180
and mentioned him in passing a few other times.

898
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,580
In my previous videos, one of the major failures

899
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,900
I think I had was not taking the time

900
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,900
to also discuss how deeply unimportant he is as a person.

901
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,860
While the comments making fun of his hat,

902
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,100
his manner of speaking, and his intelligence

903
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,700
might be fun for a laugh,

904
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,060
and I've probably had a few less

905
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,060
at the guy's expense in this very video,

906
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,960
I think it's important to stress that

907
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,020
if Tim decided that tomorrow he would stop making videos

908
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,660
and retire to the wilderness,

909
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,820
this would not be the end of terrible news analysis

910
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,820
on YouTube.

911
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,060
Another person would rise to fill the beanie

912
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:32,800
and YouTube has no shortage of loudmouth commentators

913
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,000
ready to spoon feed their audience trash

914
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,160
and tell them it's news,

915
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,700
and this is true across the political spectrum.

916
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,360
What I hope this video does is highlight

917
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,040
some of the techniques to watch out for,

918
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,500
the repeated use of sources

919
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,520
from one side of the political spectrum,

920
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,480
the embarrassingly wrong predictions,

921
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,960
and the absolute refusal to criticize certain politicians.

922
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,080
There's no easy way to spot these people,

923
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,920
but here are a few tips I found personally helpful.

924
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,880
If a single person or small team

925
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,600
are producing huge volumes of content,

926
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,320
commenting on a wide number of issues,

927
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,280
the odds are good that they don't know nearly enough

928
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,960
to be covering such a wide array of topics.

929
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,480
If someone says they're giving you news

930
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,480
right down the middle

931
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,680
and their comment section is filled with partisans

932
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,120
for one political side,

933
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,980
the news you're getting probably isn't neutral.

934
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:19,200
Don't let someone extrapolate anecdotes

935
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,720
into broader social trends,

936
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,080
demand numbers or research

937
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,100
before believing anyone who makes comments

938
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,600
about entire nations or groups of people,

939
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,900
and be wary of small anecdotes

940
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,100
and stories that can't be falsified.

941
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,380
If someone tells you a story

942
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,500
from their personal experience

943
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,020
or an obscure news event

944
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:38,380
that may have only been covered by a few sources,

945
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,300
be very wary of anything they tell you next

946
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,500
because often there's no way

947
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,820
to fact check any of these stories.

948
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:47,600
This person could just as easily make up anything

949
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,900
that some random friend told them

950
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:51,180
or use a one-off event

951
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:54,300
that isn't representative of anything.

952
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,680
They may not even be doing this to deceive you.

953
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,460
It could just be a simple misunderstanding

954
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,780
of how the news works.

955
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:01,780
You can't understand the world at large

956
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:04,140
by talking to your buddy down the street.

957
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,940
You actually have to do some work.

958
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,960
And if you're the sort of person who has some time,

959
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,300
try fact checking a few random videos.

960
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,500
If someone can be shown to be consistently wrong,

961
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,140
they're probably not worth listening to.

962
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,080
And credits roll, end of YouTube video.

963
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,340
Or that was the plan

964
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,700
before an angry mob of Trump supporters

965
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,940
broke into the US Capitol

966
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:27,660
to stop accounting of electoral college votes.

967
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,460
Details are still hazy so early into this event,

968
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,420
but this video would be incomplete

969
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:34,900
if I didn't make a few connections here.

970
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,260
To describe the events as neutral as I can,

971
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,820
President Trump staged a rally in Washington DC

972
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,660
on January 6th, making his case to his supporters

973
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:45,340
that the recent federal election was illegitimate.

974
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,020
This follows two months of claiming

975
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,220
the election has been illegitimate.

976
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,420
We're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.

977
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,380
I love Pennsylvania Avenue.

978
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,120
And we're going to the Capitol.

979
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,280
Following the speech,

980
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,440
his supporters marched on the Capitol building

981
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,160
where the certified election results were being counted.

982
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,520
Security at the building was quickly bypassed

983
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,320
and there were several acts of vandalism and theft.

984
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,020
The counting of the results was halted.

985
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,160
Elected officials were escorted to safety

986
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,480
and eventually several arrests were made.

987
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,420
Eventually the building was cleared,

988
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,440
the counting of the votes was resumed

989
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,680
and Joe Biden was declared the president-elect.

990
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,160
These are the events that occurred,

991
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,320
but what's really important

992
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,560
is how people consume commentary about them,

993
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,240
which will affect how we understand them

994
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,160
in a broader context.

995
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,140
I spent a lot of time in this video talking about Tim Poole,

996
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:37,520
but he's just a case study for a much larger problem.

997
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,800
There's a right-wing echo chamber that reaches all the way

998
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,400
from the lowliest of grifters

999
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,400
to the highest offices around the world.

1000
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,120
For example, when Representative Matt Gaetz said this.

1001
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:50,480
And I don't know if the reports are true,

1002
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,760
but the Washington Times has just reported

1003
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,280
some pretty compelling evidence

1004
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,660
from a facial recognition company

1005
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:58,840
showing that some of the people

1006
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,760
who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters.

1007
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,100
They were masquerading as Trump supporters

1008
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,960
and in fact were members

1009
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,320
of the violent terrorist group Antifa.

1010
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,120
Here he's amplifying a story that had been discredited

1011
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,440
from the Washington Times,

1012
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,120
a right-wing outlet with a long history

1013
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,400
of distorting the news.

1014
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,960
The story was so incredibly false

1015
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,280
it had to be heavily edited after the fact.

1016
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,800
Of course, after the fact is after it was repeated

1017
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,160
by a politician in an official hearing.

1018
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,440
And if we look at Tucker Carlson,

1019
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,600
we can see an example of something similar.

1020
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,260
Millions of Americans sincerely believe

1021
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,960
the last election was fake.

1022
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,880
You can dismiss them as crazy.

1023
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,640
You can call them conspiracy theorists.

1024
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,220
You can kick them off Twitter.

1025
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,620
But that won't change their minds.

1026
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,800
Rather than trying to change their minds

1027
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,720
to convince them and reassure them

1028
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,120
that the system is real, that the democracy work,

1029
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:54,360
as you would do if you cared about the country

1030
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:56,120
or the people who live here,

1031
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,800
our new leaders will try to silence them.

1032
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,160
Tucker acknowledges the angry mob is right-wing,

1033
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:03,400
but he not only presents them as more legitimate

1034
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,240
to any left-wing demonstrators,

1035
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,760
but he also justifies the anger felt within the mob.

1036
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:12,240
To me, it seems obvious that these people were stirred up

1037
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,800
by claims that the election was fraudulent or invalid,

1038
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,000
claims that had been coming from the mouth of the president

1039
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,620
and his supporters for months.

1040
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,840
We shouldn't be surprised that people

1041
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,640
who were repeating these claims are so quick to try

1042
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,800
and cause confusion around this event.

1043
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,120
We need to call moments like these what they are,

1044
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:31,120
a desperate attempt to rewrite reality in front of our eyes,

1045
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,880
the invention of conspiracy theories and rationalizations

1046
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,840
that shift blame away from the harmful rhetoric

1047
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,320
these people employ.

1048
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,880
This isn't about presenting the truth.

1049
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,400
It's about finding a version of events

1050
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,320
that can be politically capitalized on by the far right

1051
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,360
so they can seize more power.

1052
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:49,020
Whether he knows it or not, Tim is part of this machine.

1053
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,860
I don't particularly care if he's a cynical grifter

1054
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:52,980
or a useful idiot.

1055
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,760
The point is he endlessly produces content

1056
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,540
that attacks the left while excusing the excesses

1057
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,380
of the right.

1058
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,660
We can see that pretty clearly from his reaction

1059
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,380
to the events on January 6th.

1060
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,880
He's very quick to assign blame for the events

1061
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,100
to the left, the media, and he offers a rationalization

1062
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,660
for his role in all of this as well.

1063
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,700
Let me tell you the difference between me and Jake Tapper.

1064
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,500
I should say for the most part, CNN.

1065
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,820
I have condemned all the violence,

1066
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,260
I'm not gonna pretend to be a psychic

1067
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,740
who can see the future.

1068
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,060
But when I predicted this over and over again,

1069
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,020
telling you what I'm seeing and what I think will happen,

1070
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,940
well, then they blame me.

1071
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,420
They say, it's your fault, my fault, that I warned you

1072
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:38,660
and I told you what needed to be done to prevent this.

1073
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,220
How insane.

1074
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:42,060
I hope the earlier sections of this video

1075
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,140
help portray a criticism of Tim's content

1076
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,860
in a way that he doesn't acknowledge.

1077
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,620
Condemning violence is fine,

1078
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,240
but it doesn't absolve him from devoting so much of his time

1079
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,620
to entertaining the delusions of Trump supporters.

1080
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,380
Whether it's encouraging their fantasies

1081
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,660
of overturning the election

1082
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:57,920
or stoking paranoia about vaccines,

1083
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,460
Tim Poole's content twists the news of the day

1084
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,660
into right-wing narratives,

1085
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:04,800
letting them live in the world of alternative facts.

1086
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,260
These Trump supporters have been fed a constant diet

1087
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,100
of misinformation about the election

1088
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:11,600
and misinformation about the world for some time.

1089
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,780
Tim is constantly hammering on the point

1090
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,540
that back in June, Chris Cuomo on CNN said

1091
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,860
that protests don't have to be peaceful

1092
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,900
as if this was a major contributing factor

1093
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,620
in inflaming tensions.

1094
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:26,220
But how many Trump supporters are honestly watching CNN?

1095
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,260
I think they're more likely to be watching Steven Crowder

1096
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,980
or maybe they're listening to politicians

1097
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,700
like Rudy Giuliani at the very rally they were attending

1098
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,920
that day say things like this.

1099
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,100
Let's have trial by combat.

1100
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,860
Or maybe they were listening to Tim

1101
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:45,220
who puts out video after video

1102
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:48,100
warning people about an impending civil war.

1103
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:51,140
Someone is clearly feeding this audience

1104
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,920
misinformation and fear.

1105
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,620
And I don't think it's that cable station

1106
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:55,820
that none of them are watching.

1107
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,660
And I don't think it's any of the politicians

1108
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,620
they clearly don't support.

1109
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:01,500
It's the people in the media like him

1110
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,860
who are constructing these narratives for them.

1111
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,520
During his live stream on January 6th,

1112
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,260
Tim had on a panel of voices largely doing

1113
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,820
what he always does on his channel,

1114
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,300
attack the left and the media

1115
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,260
and play defense for Donald Trump.

1116
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,020
But during the live stream, YouTube had to censor his chat

1117
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,440
for frequent incitements to violence.

1118
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:23,280
So what I'm being told is that,

1119
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,780
for those that are just tuning in,

1120
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:27,900
chat has been disabled because people in comments

1121
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,100
are inciting violence, calling for more

1122
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:30,980
and things like that.

1123
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:33,180
Tim was cognizant enough not to complain too much,

1124
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,900
incitements to violence are obviously

1125
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,420
against YouTube's rules.

1126
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,260
But is it really surprising to him

1127
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,000
that so many people in his audience

1128
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,380
are frothing at the mouth for this?

1129
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:44,980
The comments under his videos tell the same story.

1130
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:48,620
Tim's content attracts a right-wing audience for a reason.

1131
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:49,940
It gives them a vision of a world

1132
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,660
that validates their feelings.

1133
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,200
It validates all the rage and fear they feel

1134
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,360
about the world around them.

1135
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,580
The American writer Flannery O'Connor had a wonderful quote,

1136
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,940
"'The truth does not change according to our ability

1137
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:05,820
"'to stomach it emotionally.'"

1138
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,220
Tim's content isn't about delivering the truth

1139
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,380
to his audience.

1140
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:12,940
It's about giving them stories that let them avoid it.

1141
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,580
This was a tough video to make.

1142
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,420
Originally, it was just a quick check-in

1143
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,180
on the content of Tim Pool to make sure it's still awful

1144
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:21,460
because I thought we were kind of due for that.

1145
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,020
It got a bit away from me and ballooned

1146
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,180
into something much bigger.

1147
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:26,460
And then the events of January 6th happened

1148
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,280
and I needed to add more to it still.

1149
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:32,700
Much thanks goes out to Tim Pool Clips

1150
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,660
who helped me with the earliest version of this video.

1151
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,300
He was a great resource.

1152
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:39,780
His links are all below in the description box.

1153
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,580
Also, thanks to Tim Bon Toast,

1154
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:45,300
he was very helpful in bouncing some ideas off of.

1155
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,300
I think he's got some stuff cooking about Tim Pool

1156
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:49,820
in the future, so take a look out for that.

1157
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:53,480
Thank you so much to all my patrons for being patient.

1158
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:56,900
Content has been a little slim on my channel lately,

1159
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,700
but I'm hoping to turn that around a little bit

1160
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,660
in the not too distant future.

1161
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:03,380
