0	7040	The world is great, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.
7040	11760	Every year we have a deluge of conservative non-fiction containing the wisdom of pundits
11760	16880	and politicians alike. Many of these books pop up on bestseller lists, often under suspicious
16880	21680	circumstances, only to vanish a few weeks later. They're marketed as fan merchandise, to be
21680	26000	consumed, though not deeply understood, and they fit neatly into a publishing niche where
26000	30720	some conservative authors put away their long-standing grudges for a chance to make some money.
30720	36400	Here's one example. Candace Owens recently had her book reach the New York Times bestseller list.
36400	39600	Here was her response on Twitter.
39600	42880	So excited about this. I'm officially a New York Times best-selling author.
43520	49280	High five, emojis. And five days later, she had this to say about the New York Times.
49280	52880	It's time for our Department of Justice to begin looking into the New York Times.
52960	56400	Here's a fun fact. This is the tweet that Dave Rubin blocked me for.
56400	60800	I was really just posting two screencaps of tweets he had made, and they read,
60800	65040	The world controls tried to burn it, but failed miserably. Now a New York Times bestseller,
65040	69760	and number one in the political freedom category. And then a bunch of fire emojis.
69760	70720	The second tweet read,
71600	75760	Also, the dirty secret of the publishing world is that the New York Times bestseller list is almost
75760	81120	a total fabrication. It's not based on sales. They have a secret formula. Yes, really.
81120	84400	It's nice to see these conservatives pretend, at least for a brief moment,
84400	89360	that the New York Times is reputable. So long as they can advertise the sales of their own book,
89360	94400	of course. These books have such catchy titles. What's so great about America?
94400	99200	The three C's that make America great. How to destroy America in three easy steps.
99200	105600	Death of a Nation. Adios America. Of the Izing. Stupid black man.
105600	108320	In defense of internment. That's real.
108880	114720	Killing the mob. Killing Crazy Horse. Killing the SS. Killing England. Killing Patton. Killing
114720	119280	Kennedy. Killing Lincoln. Killing the rising sun. Killing Reagan. Killing Jesus. That doesn't work.
119280	122320	Killing the killers. Finally, someone stop them.
122320	126080	These are a tiny fraction of the many books published in the last two decades by conservative
126080	131040	pundits and politicians. Comparatively, you don't see as many by left-wing pundits. For example,
131040	136160	Bill O'Reilly alone has written more books than the entire MSNBC prime time lineup.
136160	140240	Many of these books have a recurring theme. That America is an exceptional nation,
140240	145200	filled with greatness. And there are forces, typically on the left, that want to destroy it.
145200	149120	I wanted to dig into some of these books, so I headed over to my local library and picked
149120	152720	out the first three books in the political science section by conservative authors.
153600	157520	The first was How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps by Ben Shapiro.
157520	161760	Second was Addicted to Outrage, How Thinking Like a Recovering Addict Can Heal the Country
161760	167680	by Glenn Beck. And the last was Don't Burn This Book, Thinking for Yourself in the Age of Unreason
167680	173600	by Dave Rubin. Let's dive into the knowledge, polemics, and philosophy hidden within the pages
173600	180000	of these books. How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps is not a great title. The three things
180000	184400	discussed aren't really steps and they are definitely not easy, but before we get to them,
184400	188560	we have to go through some political theory invented by Ben Shapiro himself.
188560	192960	Shapiro splits Americans into two camps, those who want to hold America together,
192960	198480	or as he dubs them, unionists, and those who want to destroy America, who he calls
198480	204080	disintegrationists. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? According to Shapiro, this isn't a
204080	208160	simple left-right divide, as he mentions there are forces on the left and right who can be
208160	213520	disintegrationists, though he spends roughly 95% of the book criticizing the left, with a few pages
213520	217920	thrown in where he complains about Marco Rubio and the alt-right even get a few paragraphs.
217920	222320	When it comes to left-wing forces trying to destroy America, here's one example he offers.
222320	228000	Mario Lopez committed the grave sin of suggesting that it would be dangerous as a parent to determine
228000	231920	based on a three-year-old's gender confusion that the child is indeed suffering from gender
231920	236960	dysphoria, adding, you're just a kid. This was enough to spur e to pressure Lopez for a public
236960	245120	apology, which he duly gave. The man has a family to support. So do we all. This breathless description
245120	251360	of Mario Lopez nearly having his life ruined had me laughing for a solid 15 seconds when I read it.
251360	256080	As if Mario Lopez is one bad take from his family being destitute living on the streets.
256720	261280	And this is representative of a lot of the supposed threats that this book details. Tiny
261280	266080	examples cherry-picked and then exaggerated to an absurd extreme. And some examples are just
266080	271040	flat-out distortions. Here's what one of those looks like. Disintegrationists have categorized
271040	276160	culturally unifying symbols like the American flag as inherently divisive. If America, as a
276160	281200	concept, is polarizing, so too is the flag. These sentences have a citation that will let us know
281200	285200	why Ben is making this very extreme claim. According to the article cited in the book,
285200	289120	this is taken from a new story about Traveler's Rest High School, where the principal banned
289120	293760	bringing the American flag to football games. This was because students were taunting a visiting team
293760	298400	from Berea High School, who were mostly Hispanic, by waving the flags in their face and shouting
298400	303520	things like, go home, leading to confrontations in the stands. Reading the principal's reasoning
303520	308880	hardly sounds like Shapiro's characterization. The principal wrote, using the American flag to
308880	315120	display disrespect or unsportsmanlike behavior is, in itself, improper and disrespectful to our flag.
315120	319840	He's clearly saying that it wasn't the American flag that was divisive. He was upset that the flag
319840	324720	was being used as camouflage for an attack on Hispanic teenagers. A few days later, after a
324720	329360	social media storm, the decision was reversed, although there was no criticism from Shapiro on
329360	334800	the mob justice in action here. Also, if you're curious, all of this took place in the conservative
334800	340160	Greenville County in the very conservative state of South Carolina, which hardly sounds like a
340160	344400	stronghold for the left. In just this little excerpt, we can see that Shapiro has taken a
344400	349280	single incident, lied about the intentions behind it, completely ignored the social media mob when
349280	354480	it worked in his favor, and then extrapolated his straw man to an entire group he's made up.
354480	358960	In other words, it's all a bunch of hot smoke. Now let's get to those three steps to destroy
358960	363520	America. Step one in destroying America is convincing citizens that some people will
363520	367840	have to sacrifice their existing rights in order for others to have new ones.
367840	371840	What a wonderfully vague statement. Luckily, he expands on what he means by
371840	377200	new rights. Saying that society can be improved because children can be molded into literally
377200	381440	anything opens the door to life-or-death fights about what they will be molded into.
381440	385680	It's hard to take Ben seriously when he uses terms such as literally anything,
385680	391040	as if children are being molded into boulders or rainbows. Throughout this book, and in much of his
391040	395680	rhetoric, Ben often characterizes the left in extreme terms to make them sound completely
395680	400560	unreasonable. So if someone is saying, perhaps we should, for example, allow children to have a
400560	406000	broader understanding of what gender means, is turned into literally anything. And when he writes
406000	411360	vaguely like this, he can make his bigotry against, for example, trans people sound like some kind of
411520	416640	high-minded principle. It's the intellectual camouflage for an ignorant and bigoted opinion.
416640	422800	Ben argues quite forcibly that the world is the way it is because of some kind of natural order.
422800	427840	He argues that the philosophy behind the founding of the United States of America,
427840	433600	as espoused in its founding documents, represent an understanding of fundamental human nature,
433600	438480	something Ben never quite defines. That by founding a nation based on this understanding
438480	443200	of human nature, the United States has uniquely organized itself to best allow human life to
443200	447680	flourish by respecting the natural rights of people. And hopefully alarm bells are going off
447680	452080	because even a basic knowledge of American history should reveal how poorly America has respected
452080	456480	the rights of people, but that will be addressed in the third step. Instead, the first is about
456480	461760	asserting the importance of protecting American values. Shapiro goes on. We are not gods and
461760	466480	simply do not have the capacity to rectify imbalances of innate individual qualities.
466560	470560	We don't have the ability to guarantee that even two kids the same age living on the same street
470560	474480	will start from the same point. Two children growing up in the same family don't even start
474480	478960	from the same point. Shapiro is fixated on this idea of inherent differences,
478960	483760	that outcomes can be explained on that basis. You could maybe argue that for individuals,
483760	488000	in that when you see a person who has succeeded greatly in the world, it may be down to some kind
488000	492800	of innate quality that has made success something easier for them. Though, of course, that discounts
492800	497680	how luck can play a role in an individual's life. For example, the luck of being a failed screen
497680	501600	writer who is fashioned into a conservative media figure by a billionaire trying to influence
501600	506240	popular discourse on politics using millions of dollars to create the illusion of talent.
506240	510080	Of course, none of this really matters when we're talking about groups of people. Reducing
510080	514720	disparities to individual choices is a convenient way of ignoring structural and historic forces
514720	519120	that shape our lives and reduce the chances of groups of people to succeed in the world.
519120	523120	Unless the claim is the reason these groups aren't succeeding is because they have all
523120	529120	independently made the same or similar individual choices as if these disparities between two groups
529120	534320	are the reflection of some kind of natural defect. For example, if poor people are naturally
534320	539600	destined to be poor because they are innately incapable of being anything else. Perhaps their
539600	544240	innate intelligence, for instance, isn't high enough to succeed in the world. This, of course,
544240	549440	is the justification of philosophies such as social Darwinism, which say that people's success
549440	555040	in the world is a product of their inherent or natural abilities as opposed to historical or
555040	559920	social forces that shape our lives. Of course, what this argument really does is undermine any
559920	565280	attempt to change society for the better. Most of this book is an argument to keep society the way
565280	569840	it is and avoid any attempt at improving the structures that shape our lives. There are a
569840	574720	few cute moments of hypocrisy in this book, such as one part where Ben Shapiro complains that
574720	580320	Elizabeth Warren was selling billionaire tears mugs. Ben Shapiro, the man who has for years
580320	585440	been selling a tumbler that reads leftist tears. Though if you really want to shame Elizabeth
585440	591120	Warren, accusing her of stealing jokes from Ben Shapiro would be devastating. As always, whenever
591120	596160	we hear Ben Shapiro talking about being personally responsible and succeeding on your own merits,
596240	601440	I very much recommend the Vanity Fair article that details how Ben Shapiro was able to succeed
601440	606080	and become a conservative pundit, not through the strength of his own abilities, but through
606080	610960	the careful craftsmanship of a public media persona through the help of his business partner,
610960	615760	Jeremy Boring, and through the investment of millions of dollars to get his daily wire
615760	620880	operation off the ground. Let's move on to the next step, though. Step two in destroying America
620880	625440	is undermining our culture of rights in favor of a culture of protection by government.
625440	630240	You may have noticed step two doesn't follow step one. Why would you need to create new rights
630240	635280	in step one if you were creating a culture that undermines them? What Shapiro seems to be really
635280	640800	upset by is this expansion of what rights mean, to be anything that he can't effectively tie to
640800	645680	the founding documents of America. And of course, he is exclusively privileging his own interpretation
645680	651040	of those founding documents. In this discussion of rights, I had expected some mention of the
651040	656800	Universal Declaration of Human Rights published in 1948 and adopted by the United Nations,
656800	661440	especially considering the American connection of Eleanor Roosevelt. But Ben doesn't really compare
661440	666160	or contrast the American founding documents with anything. He describes the evolution of rights
666160	670560	throughout much of the Enlightenment as leading up to America and that discussion ending with
670560	675680	its founding, as if the American founding documents were so good and everything that's come afterward
675680	680960	simply isn't worth acknowledging. He simply takes what he knows and seems to assume that it is the
681120	686080	best and only version that should be considered. And his evidence for this is the greater material
686080	691120	success of the United States on the world stage. History is simply following a script that was
691120	696000	destined to happen, which leads us to this. The third and final step in destroying America is
696000	701200	convincing citizens that America represents fruit of the poisonous tree, that America was founded
701200	706160	in evil, and that there is no arc to history. To support this very heavy claim, we get a brief
706160	710160	rundown of American history and this gives us a really good understanding of how Ben Shapiro's
710160	714480	worldview is shaped. An honest recount of American history is a very mixed record. The
714480	718880	country that helped fight fascism in World War II is the same one that enslaved millions for nearly
718880	724080	a century. Shapiro acknowledges both sides of the record, but his framing is deeply suspect.
724080	728800	Any and all crimes perpetrated by the American state are waved away as simply being products
728800	733040	of their time, from the genocide of indigenous peoples, being reduced to the norm of nation
733040	738240	states of the day, to slavery being an institution being practiced around the globe. I'm not sure how
738240	741920	this is a defense. If he's trying to imply that we should criticize other countries for doing
741920	747200	similar things, I fully agree. But instead he's using this to shield any direct criticism of
747200	752000	America. This is probably best represented by a quote he uses that comes from Paul Johnson.
752000	756320	Europeans were moving into the former hunting grounds of the world's primitive peoples in five
756320	761920	continents. So when America is engaging in imperialism and seizing lands from indigenous
761920	767440	peoples and waging war on its neighbors, it's acting as Europeans do. But whenever the United
767440	772400	States writes something lovely in its founding documents, that is uniquely American. It's a
772400	778000	highly selective reading of America, designed to emphasize the good as American and the bad as
778000	783120	something foreign or belonging to the wider world. When discussing positive things the United States
783120	787920	has done, such as the aforementioned fighting of fascism, the title sections as those as
787920	793840	Savior of the West, something uniquely American that only this proud noble nation could accomplish,
793840	799120	as if World War II was fought and won solely by the United States. It seems insulting to all the
799120	804480	other nations that participated, but unsurprising as Ben doesn't seem concerned with the histories
804480	808720	of other nations or the broader interactions between them unless it can be used to further
808720	813680	glorify the United States. When discussing more negative aspects of American history,
813680	818000	Shapiro tends to frame them as favorably as possible. Here's one example describing
818000	824080	American westward expansion. Native American population density was, at the time, 0.17 persons
824080	828880	per square mile. The Census Bureau historically considered any area unsettled with a population
828880	833520	density of fewer than two people per square mile. In general, the pioneers were not wrong to
833520	838160	cast their eyes westward, although as we will see this population movement had dire consequences
838160	843440	for Native Americans. Ben doesn't even acknowledge the fact that the Census Bureau justifying
843440	848160	westward expansion of the American state is ridiculously self-serving. He also makes no
848160	853120	mention of the gold rush that sent scores of Americans west, or the concept of manifest
853120	858640	destiny which created a religious justification for the American expansion. Instead, the only
858640	863840	other factors he really mentions are the looming threat of European powers on the continent,
863840	869120	which in many ways reads like the justifications of the day for moving westward, which led to many
869120	874400	wars and the displacement and murder of countless indigenous people. Shapiro also feels the need to
874400	879200	add that inter-tribal warfare was common between Native American tribes, and he spends time
879200	884560	resisting the noble savage trope. And while I can understand wanting to push back against a stereotype
884560	889440	like the noble savage, a better reading of history would be if he instead cast these indigenous
889440	894960	peoples as human beings. In many ways, he seems to want the reader to not feel too sorry for these
894960	899920	indigenous peoples who were slaughtered and had their waves of life destroyed. His overall view
899920	904800	of history is that the bad is commonplace in the world, and even the victims aren't sates. But when
904800	910880	they're as good, it becomes uniquely American. Or as Ben puts it, when we can find injustice within
910880	916880	American history, that is our fault, but that is not America's fault. America was always great,
916880	922720	even if she was never perfect. He constantly refers to the eternal and good values represented
922720	927600	by America, something sacrosanct and unquestionable, and those who do question anything are to be
927600	932880	regarded as disintegrationists trying to destroy the country. It's amazing how little thought went
932880	937760	into this book. It's a collection of facts, often misinterpreted or misleading, and a series of
937760	942560	premises that aren't even a quarter baked. This was obviously produced as a product to be consumed
942560	947280	quickly and without much thought, the sort of thing for fans to buy, not to spark genuine political
947280	952320	discussion. Ironically though, I think it's sincere. This probably is Ben Shapiro trying his best to
952320	956480	write a thoughtful book about history and philosophy. He's just a bad writer and a shallow
956480	962320	thinker. It's perhaps best embodied by this quote here. To most Americans, America is about, and was
962320	967360	always about, the gradual realization of those beautiful promises, rights, and institutions for
967360	971760	all Americans. Perhaps most of us never thought about all that. Perhaps we just saw the flag
971760	977760	flying and felt it, or watched a 4th of July parade and knew it. The book isn't a serious appeal to
977760	982000	any well thought out concept of America, but rather a vindication of feelings of pride one
982000	987440	has when looking at the various symbols of America, a vindication of unthinking patriotism.
987440	992720	Ben Shapiro has done the work of figuring out that America is great and blameless, so those
992720	996400	reading this book don't have to think about it for themselves and continue their lives at
996400	1001520	normal, remembering to salute the flag. Those who would say otherwise threaten that complacency,
1001520	1006080	possibly upsetting the natural order of things and ruining Ben's cushy life. So what Ben offers
1006080	1011040	in a book like this is a security blanket, an unironic version of that Stephen Colbert book,
1011040	1015600	America, re-becoming the greatness we never weren't. Let's move on to Glenn Beck's,
1015600	1019680	addicted to outrage how thinking like a recovering addict can heal the country.
1019680	1024800	We need a bit of context on Beck before we move forward though. This book was published in 2018,
1024800	1029040	and in the years leading up to it, Beck had a bit of an identity crisis. He was a never Trump
1029040	1033840	Republican, and during the 2016 election he tried to rebrand himself as a more moderate voice.
1033840	1038400	By 2018 he was pivoting again, claiming that he had gotten Trump completely wrong and while he
1038400	1042400	didn't like him stylistically, he thought he was doing a good job as president. This book is part
1042400	1047440	of that pivot, reframes outrage in political discourse as a creation of the media, including
1047440	1052400	himself in his earlier days. But he criticizes himself the same way he criticizes Trump.
1052400	1055760	His tone isn't great, but he still thinks he was right on the facts.
1055760	1058480	For those who don't remember some of those facts, here's a quick example.
1063840	1070720	Nationalists, graft, acorn style organizations, revolution and hidden agenda.
1071600	1078800	O-L-I-G-A-R-H. One letter is missing.
1079920	1088720	Why did I select these words? Because acorn selects tides. They all select their words first
1088720	1096960	and then tie them all together into one word. Oligarch, for quite the one that's missing, is why.
1096960	1100560	I'm pretty sure oligarchy has a C in there too. But on the substance of this argument,
1100560	1105040	you may have noticed that the Barack Obama presidency did not plunge America into some
1105040	1111040	kind of socialist oligarchy. But this exemplifies a lot of what Glenn Beck's Fox News show was all
1111040	1116080	about, telling us that Democrats are poised to create some kind of socialist hellscape.
1116080	1120320	These are the supposed facts he stands by. Glenn Beck, in this book, is trying to present
1120320	1125280	himself as a voice of reason. But he was never a reasonable guy, and he still isn't. And it
1125280	1130480	has nothing to do with his theatrics. Have I stepped through a wormhole and come out in France?
1130480	1133840	I mean, I'm not really sure if the... Look, there I am.
1133840	1137200	Okay, maybe not nothing. But the problem runs a lot deeper than the silly stuff.
1137200	1142640	Glenn Beck's book is a lot like Ben Shapiro's in that it hits similar notes. Although, to Beck's
1142640	1147040	credit, he presents a more fact-based reading of history. He goes into far greater detail,
1147040	1151120	bringing up specific crimes such as the Trail of Tears, where tens of thousands of Indigenous
1151120	1155200	people were displaced and forced to march west, or the destruction of Tulsa's Black Wall Street,
1155200	1159840	where a racist mob ransacked an affluent black community, killing many people and destroying
1159840	1165040	that community's economy. When Glenn Beck gets to the good side of America, it seems thin in
1165040	1169280	comparison to his chapter covering the bad. Though he weighs it all away with his discussion
1169280	1174480	about the moral character of America. It's a weird reading of history where, instead of using
1174480	1178960	it to understand the present, he instead would rather us look at history as a means for us to
1178960	1184960	sit back and judge the past, to decipher whether America good or America bad. Beck seems to want
1184960	1188960	us to ignore the past entirely when he writes, it's not what happens to you historically, what
1188960	1193440	matter is what you do with it now. Unless he's talking about learning lessons from history about
1193440	1199200	the left, ascending and bringing with it fascism. One example both Beck and Shapiro use to downplay
1199200	1203760	the impact of historical discrimination is when they compare Asian communities to black ones,
1203760	1207840	a comparison that is overly reductive as there are many different Asian and black communities
1207840	1212080	within the United States representing different waves of immigration and different historical
1212080	1216880	experiences. For example, using the case of Japanese Americans, which Ben Shapiro highlights
1216880	1222320	specifically, the interment of Japanese Americans during World War II led to the United States
1222320	1226560	government providing reparations, something that has never been done for black Americans who can
1226560	1231200	trace their ancestry back to slavery, regardless of what anyone even thinks of reparations. The
1231200	1236400	point I'm making here is that these two experiences are not the same, and to compare experiences like
1236400	1241520	these two, as both Glenn Beck and Ben Shapiro do in their books, is misleading. Glenn Beck's book
1241520	1246240	was also annoying to read as he tries to wrap this veil of respectability around himself still
1246240	1250160	pushing the same ridiculous talking points he always had been. Great example is how he talks
1250160	1254640	about climate change. Beck has a long history fighting against any sort of legislative solution
1254640	1258880	to climate change, and to hear his side of the story, he isn't denying the science, he's simply
1258880	1263280	concerned about the costs. Reading his book, he almost sounds reasonable when he writes,
1263280	1267680	I believe that the globe is warming as much as we can trust and verify the trends. Let me accept
1267680	1272320	the current claim that the world has warned by 0.7 degrees in the last hundred years. I also accept
1272320	1276880	that man can do significant damage to the planet and has done some damage over the industrial age.
1276880	1280960	It makes sense to me that belching toxins into the air is not good for any of us, including the
1280960	1285840	planet and his other inhabitants over time. Aside from some shaky language, that sounds fine.
1285840	1290160	But less than two pages later, he's saying, when you demand absolute acceptance of your theories
1290160	1294880	and back up your science with arguments of moral outrage, you end up having to shove, shout, and,
1294880	1299680	in the end, shoot. And then he goes on to compare climate change to religion and describes one side
1299680	1305200	as the Spanish Inquisition. This, to me, does not sound like the beginning of a reasonable debate.
1305200	1310720	This sounds like Glenn Beck is portraying one side as incapable of it. And more importantly,
1310720	1315280	regardless of what Glenn Beck says about the people who accept broad scientific consensus,
1315280	1320560	what exactly does he suggest we do about the aspects of climate change he's conceded are true?
1320560	1325680	Well, in this book he describes having an energy-efficient foam and some other personal measures,
1325680	1331200	and that's about it. While personal choices and living in a way that's more friendly to the
1331200	1336320	environment can certainly have an impact, a crisis as big as climate change cannot be solved through
1336320	1340560	people choosing to reduce their personal emissions alone. Huge polluters, such as the
1340560	1345200	US military or fossil fuel companies, need to be part of the solution too. When it comes to
1345200	1350800	policy-based initiatives or some kind of collective action to combat something Beck will ostensibly
1350800	1355760	say is true, he's far less willing and instead talks about how vague and untrustworthy science
1355760	1361040	can be. What good does Glenn Beck say he believes in climate change do if he's not willing to fight
1361040	1365760	for it beyond making a few personal concessions? Beck repeated this pattern in his commentary
1365760	1370160	about the COVID vaccines. Glenn Beck made a tweet about his opinion on the vaccine with this
1370160	1375680	charming photograph replacing a syringe with a middle finger. People assumed he was an anti-vaxxer,
1375680	1382960	so he went on Tucker Carlson's show to explain. I too am not anti-vaccine. I had COVID, my wife
1382960	1388720	had COVID, everybody in my family had it. I'm not going to get a vaccination because I've already
1388720	1395280	had it. What he's saying here is wrong. You can get COVID more than once, since the antibodies
1395280	1399600	don't last forever and a vaccine protects you from more serious symptoms. It also offers a
1399600	1404080	greater degree of protection against new variants. But more broadly, he's using the same tactic he
1404080	1408320	uses when he's talking about climate change. Make as many reasonable admissions as possible,
1408320	1413600	push them aside, and then use a bunch of anti-vaxx talking points. And when you make a good case,
1414800	1421440	then we'll follow. Make the case. But you can't question it. The problem is, even when he admits
1421520	1425040	to certain parts of the case, his position doesn't change. And if someone's ultimate
1425040	1429360	position stays the same, and the only change to their arguments is that they're predicated
1429360	1434240	by some admissions that ultimately don't change them, they're using those admissions to create
1434240	1439680	the illusion of carefully considering the evidence. An irony here is that in his book, Glenn Beck
1439680	1444160	wrote, we're spending our time arguing about the efficacy of vaccinations, a question that was
1444160	1449360	pretty much settled two centuries ago. So did he believe it was settled then and change his mind
1449360	1455440	in 2021? In 2009, Beck was fear-mongering about vaccines. If you say, don't take the swine flu
1456000	1462800	vaccination, and then, you know, it turns out that the swine flu, this particular wave is virulent,
1462800	1467360	and the vaccination would have helped. Well, then, you know, what role did I play in that?
1468400	1474000	The opposite is true. I say, hey, everybody take the vaccination. And that turns out to be
1474000	1479600	deadly? What role did I play in that? So he was skeptical of vaccines, then considered them
1479600	1484560	settled a few years later, and now he's once again skeptical. Some additional context might
1484560	1490720	help here. In 2009 and in 2021, these two vaccines were being championed by Barack Obama and Joe
1490720	1495920	Biden. And when we look at that quote from 2018 in Glenn Beck's book, we have to remember that
1495920	1500800	the vaccine discourse of the time was criticizing Trump for repeating lies about vaccine-causing
1500800	1506560	autism. In that context, the quote reads less about affirming the effectiveness of vaccines,
1506560	1511600	and is instead attempting to get the topic of vaccines out of the public discourse. Beck's
1511600	1515600	support of vaccination changes depending on who he's attacking and who he's trying to defend.
1515600	1519200	He'll accept the science, if it's the most effective way to provide cover for someone on
1519200	1524560	the right, and deny it if it's a part of attacking the left. Much like Ben Shapiro, Glenn Beck talks
1524560	1528960	about the founding fathers in tones that can only be described as religious. He refers to them
1528960	1533120	revealing an eternal truth. And then there's this line from the book. The Declaration of
1533120	1537120	Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are the most divinely inspired documents,
1537120	1542080	perhaps of all time. I should remind you all that Glenn Beck is a Christian, and it's my understanding
1542080	1546640	that the Bible is pretty important to Christians. But Beck's worldview is probably more accurately
1546640	1551280	depicted in this painting by John McNaughton. One of the funny things about these books is the
1551280	1555760	complete lack of awareness that they are one part in a long line of human history, and that eventually
1555760	1560000	the mightiest empires crumble, and another takes its place. And then they get to pretend that they
1560000	1565440	are the best there ever was, and ever will be. It happened to the Umayyad Caliphate, the Mongol
1565440	1570320	Empire, and the British Empire, and it'll likely happen to the American Empire one day too. Unless
1570320	1574240	we all die before that, of course. The real difficulty with someone who has a religious
1574240	1578880	devotion to their country is that they're not easily challenged, and worse yet, this devotion
1578880	1584000	can be used to justify all sorts of horrible things. Both Glenn Beck and Ben Shapiro aggressively
1584000	1588880	argue for American greatness, its exceptionalism, and would sooner ignore the crimes of history to
1588880	1593280	bask in that glory. The rigidness to their interpretations of what America even means
1593280	1597280	is part of the problem. When the American government was committing genocide, enslaving
1597280	1601840	people, and refusing to acknowledge the rights of women and non-white men, this, politicians of
1601840	1606800	those days, would argue were an accurate interpretation of the foundy documents. Of course,
1606800	1611680	many people would disagree with that. The lesson of being open to discussion about interpretation
1611680	1615920	seems obvious to me, but it doesn't seem to have occurred to either Ben Shapiro or Glenn Beck that
1615920	1620960	they might be wrong in their interpretation. To them, these are divinely inspired records of
1620960	1625440	eternal truth. That's not a great way to start the conversation or friendly debate these guys
1625440	1629680	pretend they want to have, and it's telling that their instructions for getting along with them
1629680	1634000	is outlining the certain types of debates they are not willing to have. I was going to spend some
1634000	1637120	time laughing at some of the fails Glenn Beck has throughout his book, but if we're going to laugh
1637200	1643280	at how dumb a book is, there's far more fertile ground in our next volume. Dave Rubins,
1643280	1648480	don't burn this book thinking for yourself in an age if unreason, is easily the laziest book of
1648480	1654000	the three I read. If Ben Shapiro and Glenn Beck are bringing their own brand of American exceptionalism
1654000	1660080	to the masses, Dave Rubin is the blueprint for how to be fooled by that message. Here's an example of
1660080	1666400	his prose. The left may no longer be liberal, but you're no longer left out. The rest of the book is
1666400	1671280	of similar quality. Of course, Rubins' project isn't to create an intellectual framework for
1671280	1676400	believing something. What he's doing, whether he's aware of this or not, is reinforcing a conservative
1676400	1682080	worldview built on ideas of American exceptionalism. Here's how he opens a chapter. Allow me to open
1682080	1686000	this chapter with a statement that's wildly controversial and gulag-worthy hate speech.
1686000	1690560	America is the greatest country in the history of the world. If you're triggered by this, stop
1690560	1695440	reading. While the second half of that lesson is solid advice, the rest of it isn't triggering
1695440	1700400	anybody. At best, you might get an eye roll. But what's important is the title of the chapter
1700400	1705920	that this little passage opens. Stop hating straight white men, America, and Western values.
1705920	1710880	Rubin is light on details about what Western values mean, and with regard to hating America,
1710880	1716080	he references some celebrities but doesn't go into detail about how or why they hate America.
1716720	1721280	As for not hating straight white men, it's an example of how he appeals to identity throughout
1721280	1726240	this book. Although he claims he's doing it ironically, Dave Rubin is constantly talking
1726240	1730320	about people's identities in his book. If someone makes a point he agrees with, he has to let you
1730320	1734320	know that he agrees with them even though they're a cis white male, and if he disagrees, he has to
1734320	1739200	make a comment about how it's not because they're a woman. Maybe he's just running this particular
1739200	1744480	attempt at a joke into the ground, but even if he's emphasizing everyone's identity for supposedly
1744480	1749120	a laugh, how many times does he have to do it until we can safely wonder if he's genuinely
1749120	1754000	obsessed with identity politics? It reminds me of someone who says they ironically enjoy a song
1754000	1758640	and are constantly singing or talking about it. At what point does that irony bleed into real
1758640	1764560	obsession? And sometimes he does the identity shtick in a more nefarious way. One anecdote Rubin
1764560	1769440	brings up is how at one of his live shows he was confronted by an audience member who was a genuine
1769440	1775040	Nazi. Rubin then put this Nazi first in line for the Q&A session so they could have a debate about
1775040	1779440	whether the Holocaust happened. In this discussion, most of the heavy lifting seems to have been done
1779440	1784080	by Rubin's guest, Michael Shermer, though Rubin pats them both on the back for the civilized debate
1784080	1789360	about whether or not this obvious historical fact occurred with a bigoted conspiracy theorist.
1789360	1794160	At no point does Rubin wonder how a Nazi showed up in his audience, and he doesn't explain why he
1794160	1798320	would choose to debate a Nazi instead of, say, someone on the left who might have been there,
1798320	1802960	assuming there was anyone from the left at this particular performance. But the truly sinister
1802960	1807760	part is the paragraph he uses to close the anecdote. One final note on this, it turned out
1807760	1813040	that the Holocaust-denied woman was transgender. Yes, that's right, a trans Holocaust denier.
1813040	1818880	Do with that what you will. What exactly does Rubin expect anyone to do with that? Personally,
1818880	1823040	it means nothing to me. Being trans doesn't disqualify someone from being a hateful conspiracy
1823040	1828160	theorist, but to an anti-trans bigot, it would be a helpful anecdote to push their own agenda
1828160	1833280	of discriminating against trans people, presenting them as mentally unbalanced. Rubin must know who
1833280	1837520	he's serving by bringing up such a meaningless fact. Here's another example of Rubin being
1837520	1843040	completely ridiculous. First of all, no. We're not an imperialist country. The United States
1843040	1848800	was literally founded on a pushback against imperialism. If I may have my own, first of all,
1848800	1854400	I wouldn't reduce the Revolutionary War to a pushback. And second, how can he possibly be
1854400	1859200	this naive? I would think any political commentator would have some awareness of
1859200	1864560	American hegemonic influence around the world. There are American military bases in over 70
1864560	1869360	countries and territories. The U.S. exerts its influence everywhere. But since it doesn't fit
1869360	1874080	the definition of an imperial power from centuries past, Rubin washes his hands of understanding the
1874080	1878160	tremendous influence the United States has over many parts of the world, and how that might fit
1878160	1883360	the definition of imperial. But it's not surprising he doesn't know or bother to know any of that.
1883360	1889280	Because as I mentioned earlier, the one word that captures this book so well is lazy. Rubin
1889280	1894240	brings up a number of different topics, sometimes more than once, and often has little to nothing
1894240	1899840	of value to say about them. At one point in the book, he copies and pastes three pages of supposed
1899840	1905360	facts from PragerU. When he tries to do his own version of Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life,
1905360	1909680	he can't even think of 12 and only writes six. In the section where he cites his sources,
1909680	1914080	he can barely fill three pages. Rubin's final message for the reader, one that
1914080	1918480	encapsulates his political philosophy, is to go out there and live your life and ignore all the
1918480	1923760	nonsense. Yes, his version of activism is to chill out and enjoy life. While I fully support Dave
1923760	1928400	Rubin, or anyone who finds him insightful, to disengage with the political process, he must
1928400	1932960	realize how his final message is the antithesis of a call to action that a political commentator
1932960	1938000	would typically make. Dave Rubin is the rube Ben Shapiro and Glenn Beck are selling their American
1938000	1942080	exceptionalism narrative to, someone who will unthinkingly accept the mythology of American
1942080	1945920	greatness and then completely disengage from the political process, because there's no reason to
1945920	1950400	improve on something that's already great. Unless it's to complain about identity politics. While
1950400	1955040	tacitly endorsing bigotry, of course. The danger of this type of lazy patriotism is that it can
1955040	1960000	be used to maintain a bad status quo, or be used as a cover for the far right to bring in fascism
1960000	1964960	under the cloak of patriotism, reducing a country to facet out principles devoid of interpretation
1964960	1969920	or nuance, and then insisting everyone prostrate themselves by proclaiming an overwhelming love of
1969920	1975360	the nation via symbols like the anthem and flag, turns political participation into a sporting
1975360	1980080	event. It's not about making society better, it's about cheering for the home team. And these books
1980080	1983840	aren't weighty discussions of politics, they're a merch to buy to show your support for the team
1983840	1988720	you're backing. That is, if anyone is buying these at all. Books by conservative pundits and
1988720	1993840	politicians regularly appear on the New York Times bestseller list, only with a small caveat
1993840	1998080	in the shape of a dagger that appears next to them. Here's the New York Times' explanation.
1998080	2003200	A dagger indicates that some retailers report receiving bulk orders. While not every book by a
2003200	2007840	conservative pundit has one of these symbols next to it, a large number do. In fact, while looking
2007840	2012400	through the hardcover non-fiction list, the dagger symbol almost only comes up for books written by
2012400	2016800	conservative pundits or politicians. In the case of all three books I mentioned in this video,
2016800	2020880	they debuted on the list with daggers, indicating bulk purchases, and were on the bestseller list
2020880	2026480	for, at most, three weeks. This isn't exactly a new finding, as it was detailed in an op-ed
2026480	2030400	written for The Hill referencing a well-known example of Donald Trump's book Triggered,
2030400	2035840	which reached number one on the list thanks to a $94,800 purchase from the Republican National
2035840	2040480	Committee. A Vox article describes how appearing on the list can boost sales on average from 13 to
2040480	2046720	14% or up to 57% for new authors. It also bestows credibility and potentially a higher advance on
2046720	2051600	future books. An article in Vanity Fair also noted that the former president's son is hardly
2051600	2056160	the only one benefiting from these bulk purchases. The National Republican Congressional Committee
2056160	2062240	spent nearly $400,000 on bulk purchases, notably spending nearly $100,000 buying copies of Dan
2062240	2068720	Crenshaw's Fortitude. In 2015, Ted Cruz used $300,000 in campaign funds to buy copies of one
2068720	2073360	of his books, A Time for Truth. It's easier to track down the bulk sales of politicians because
2073360	2078880	groups like the RNC and NRCC need to publicly report their spending. When it comes to pundits,
2078880	2084000	like the authors highlighted in this video, it gets murkier. Some hypotheses have been floated,
2084000	2088320	such as bulk purchases being demanded ahead of speaking engagements or book signings.
2088320	2092400	It's hard to say exactly, and it's not as though people don't purchase books by conservative
2092400	2097280	pundits. Bill O'Reilly has had plenty of success killing anything with a pulse, but his books tend
2097280	2101840	to stay on the bestseller lists for months at a time, which seems to reflect a genuine interest
2101840	2106000	in his work. These other authors, at least the ones I've covered in this video, don't have
2106000	2110720	nearly the staying power. It reveals a lack of genuine demand for these titles, outside of,
2110720	2116720	perhaps, a select devoted few. So devoted that apparently they all engage in bulk purchases.
2116720	2121440	And I don't blame the wider reading public for not caring. These are terrible books. The Dave
2121440	2125600	Rubin one in particular would be more readable after using it as toilet paper, and the other
2125600	2130160	two are little more than poor arguments for American exceptionalism. Assuming someone really
