1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,080
Conservative comedy is having a weird moment. Right now it has a strange dynamic where it only

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,880
makes sense in the context of two competing audiences. One, a left-wing audience that is

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,200
supposedly offended or outraged at everything, and the conservative audience laughing at that

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,480
outrage. Many conservative comedians play to this dynamic not by telling good or even legible jokes,

5
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,800
but instead emphasizing how much they're bothering the other side. For an example of this,

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:31,680
let's look at James Delingpole's 2011 book, 365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy. The introduction

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:36,080
opens with as good a primer as I've seen. Liberals are easy meat for conservatives for

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,920
several good reasons. One, liberals have no sense of humor. Two, liberals have no facts on their

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,720
side. Three, liberals are hypocrites. Four, God, being conservative himself, hates liberalism at

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,840
least as much as you do, which is why he created reasons one, two, and three. And here's one of

11
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:01,040
the jokes. Always refer in pitting, sympathetic tones to the liberal psychopathology. This

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,040
implies that liberalism is a form of mental illness, which it is. That's a joke that got

13
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,960
published in a book. Personally, it didn't drive me crazy. Maybe that's because I'm not a liberal,

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,680
but I'm not sure it would drive a liberal crazy either. It's such a weak milquetoast jab that I

15
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,480
can't imagine anyone really being bothered by this. Maybe the joke where liberals are called

16
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,600
Nazis would bother someone, but it's so wordy and clumsy it doesn't really hit. That's one of

17
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,560
the weirdest parts about conservative humor right now. It requires an imagined premise to make sense.

18
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,920
That imagined premise being an audience of easily offended left-wing people. And with that imagined

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,920
audience in mind as the target, conservative comedians put very little effort into making

20
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,960
jokes that are actually funny. Here's an example from Gutfeld, a late-night conservative comedy

21
00:01:47,280 --> 00:02:04,160
hosted by Greg Gutfeld. It's not the strongest gesture of faith in your joke when you take a

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,880
moment to explain it to the audience. This whole opening monologue is responding to the mainstream

23
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,680
media pointing out how unfunny one of Gutfeld's jokes is, and he farms that for several minutes

24
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,320
of weak jokes that are hitting back against the mainstream media. Things aren't much better on

25
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,040
YouTube with the likes of JP Sears basically making the same joke in every video where he acts as

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,680
though he's just discovered sarcasm. I can say, hand on heart, honest to Karl Marx, mandates are

27
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,600
indeed the path to freedom. So could we all please just quit being skeptical so we don't fall into

28
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:41,200
the dangerous trap of thinking for ourselves? That small example is pretty much this guy's

29
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,160
entire comedy shtick in a nutshell. He does this sarcastic impression of some imagined person on

30
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,120
the left. And by the left, by the way, this can mean everything from moderate politicians and

31
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,120
media outlets to activists on the street fighting for social change. Because in the world of

32
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,600
conservative comedy, wanting to give blankets to the homeless and abolishing nation-states are

33
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:06,240
basically the same thing. It's all just the left. None of this stuff is clever or nuanced satire.

34
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:11,200
It's just lazy references to imagined other, expressing anger and hatred rather than humor.

35
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,440
And there's no worse offender of this than the Babylon Bee. In a video of what they claim are

36
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,800
their best sketches of 2021, you have to stop voicing your opinions or that thing will kill us.

37
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,040
I agree with Martin Luther King Jr. that we should judge someone by the content of their character

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,560
and not by the color of their skin. You just got us killed!

39
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,200
I judge everything through the lens of rage!

40
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,080
All their humor is basically the slam cartoon, over and over again. All of this is probably

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
just review because I'm sure a lot of you saw that some more news video about conservative

42
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,600
comedy, but I was curious what it would be like to really engage with a single piece

43
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:52,880
of conservative comedy media. And knowing what I would be in for, I decided that piece would be

44
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:58,640
the Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness. And in this case, I guess the only joke here is on me.

45
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,200
This book is presented in the tradition of other comedy outlets needing to sell some stuff.

46
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,760
The Daily Show had its textbook parodies, America, The Book, and Earth, The Book. The

47
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,880
Colbert Report had I Am America and So Can You and America Again. And The Onion has published

48
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,760
over 10 different books ranging from original content to reprints of previously published work.

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,000
The Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness presents itself as a humorous book looking at what

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,320
wokeness really means and how it works in the real world. And while it's largely an excuse

51
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,960
to tell some bad jokes, it does expect, at least to some degree, to be taken seriously.

52
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,880
In an interview with the Heartland Institute, Babylon Bee managing editor and co-author of

53
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:43,280
this book, Joel Barry, explained. We wanted a kind of a light, silly critique that is substantive.

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,040
You know, we did our research and we wanted to make it accurate and insightful. He doesn't

55
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:55,360
describe everything he's read on the subject, but he does name check one person. Have a guess at

56
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,680
which of these two people they went to further research. It's a much more dynamic and complicated

57
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,480
relationship than you're talking about. And as far as sort of structures that, again, you're making

58
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,760
a connection between structures in terms of institutional structures that I was talking about

59
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,120
and the particular type of structures that, say, a salsora would be talking about in terms of

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,480
structuralism. That's not actually what I was talking about. And that's not what most people

61
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,680
are talking about when they talk about systems and structures. Again, that's a very tight

62
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,160
correlation you draw. But if we were to accept that correlation, then sure. But it's not only

63
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,320
that we're not accepting it, it's actually not what we're talking about. And postmodernism, again,

64
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,160
plays upon a range of things. I'm sorry? I said, you know, a lot about this, actually.

65
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,680
It was noted sword dancer James Lindsay, who the Babylon be cited as an expert on wokeness. Maybe

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,320
they also looked up Mark Lamont Hill, but reading this book, it has the same forced misunderstandings

67
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,000
of its subject that Lindsay has. For example, in James Lindsay's mind, the term inclusion

68
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
is a communism. Covid policy is a communism. And justice is also a communism. Everything is

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,560
communism. If wokeness is a buzzword that means whatever conservatives are trying to vilify,

70
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,120
Lindsay is a great source for that. Each section of this book is dedicated to goofing on and

71
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,600
explaining left-wing perspectives on culture war issues such as race and gender. And before we go

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,880
into detail, let's take care of something incredibly obvious right away. This book does indeed

73
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,000
make use of the one joke. For those that don't know, the one joke is a transphobic remark where

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,680
someone says they identify as something abstract, mocking anyone who identifies with a particular

75
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,080
gender that differs from one that they were assigned at birth. Here's an example from this

76
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,240
book. Batman is extremely insensitive to people who identify as bats. That's what the jokes are

77
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,800
going to be like. Get ready for more of that. While the Babylon be is certainly not below making that

78
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,440
joke non-stop, as you can see from their second most popular video on YouTube, this book is

79
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,720
surprisingly light on the one joke. In fact, it instead recycles a number of jokes. An early

80
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,720
example is in the introduction of this book where we get this. I think game? Though it doesn't really

81
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,080
have any rules for what you're supposed to do with those folks in the road. So I'm not sure if this

82
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:03,040
is supposed to be a game or some kind of flowchart for how your life's gonna go. The ironic finish

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:08,240
here is avoiding becoming red-pilled so you can be woke. The most common non-ending space, aside

84
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,440
from blank spaces where they didn't bother coming up with a joke, is the phrase, scream at sky. That

85
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,600
is a reference to this image. This was from a 2017 clip of someone expressing their anguish over

86
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:24,320
Donald Trump being elected president, and it has been used endlessly since then to mock people on

87
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:29,280
the left who aren't particularly fond of Donald Trump being the president. And if you think my

88
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,160
jump here is a little unfair, assuming this text refers to this particular image, the book helpfully

89
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,760
uses this exact phrase as a label for this exact image when it makes the same joke a little later

90
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:46,160
on. And of course this image appears in the book again and again and again. Here's something to

91
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,040
consider. Was joke funnier the third time or the fifth time? Or maybe it was never that funny,

92
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,440
but it does signify a person that the right is supposed to laugh at, and pointing out an angry

93
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,800
person on the left is more important than creating original or funny jokes, or in this case a joke at

94
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,400
all. This is just pointing at a person and laughing because they're upset. In addition to mocking the

95
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,280
left, this book also smugly acts as though it owns all the facts, and it makes this joke multiple

96
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,640
times. One of its favorite ways of doing that is by stating that 2 plus 2 equals 4, symbolizing how

97
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,240
the left denies obvious facts like this one. This is another joke they make many times in this book,

98
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:28,080
many, many times. The book doesn't really trade in hard facts though. Most of the basic facts in

99
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,960
this book it does get right, but it's usually the bare minimum of understanding how the world

100
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:38,880
works, and it certainly miscounts the left so badly that it's virtually unrecognizable. For example,

101
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,520
here's an excerpt from the chapter on American history. The Civil Rights Movement was the worst

102
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,480
thing to happen in America since slavery. In it, a right-wing, left-wing communist Christian

103
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,440
revolutionary liberator and white nationalist named Martin Luther King Jr. encouraged everyone

104
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,520
to judge people by their character instead of the color of their skin. Not very woke, MLK. He also

105
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,560
advocated for desegregation, which caused whiteness to poison the safe spaces black Americans had

106
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,320
worked so hard to build. Tragic. Obviously the joke here is that this is how the modern left

107
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,200
supposedly reads history, incoherent and backwards. Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent figure in

108
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:20,880
the Civil Rights Movement, obviously. That is one of the few facts that this book couldn't possibly

109
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,280
get wrong, and those are the only facts it really tries to present, never going past anything more

110
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:31,040
complicated than 2 plus 2 equals 4. On occasion, it does go out on a limb, such as in the science

111
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:35,920
section where it mistakes gender and sex, to back up its claim that the left is attacking biology,

112
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,400
but that's about as far as it'll go at approaching any fact that might confuse a person over the age

113
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,040
of 10. It also reveals the depth at which they understand any of the topics they're talking about.

114
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,040
They might get basic facts that any child could understand right, and then fails completely

115
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,120
because they have no real understanding of the facts that are being discussed or how the other

116
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:58,080
side even sees them. Let's go back to the MLK passage though. This is also making an implicit

117
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,560
fact claim behind this joke, that the left doesn't understand the message of Martin Luther King Jr.

118
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,280
and are instead perverting it to fit some kind of woke agenda. It's the sort of thing you would

119
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:12,320
hear on Fox News, ignoring the radical politics of MLK, such as his support for union movements

120
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,280
or opposing American imperialism. This book has a very bland, watered down, great school version

121
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:21,280
in mind when it speaks of Martin Luther King Jr., presenting him as a man who wanted people to be

122
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,560
less judgmental and not advocate for social justice. Its jokes and humor only work if you're

123
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,520
completely ignorant of the subjects they're talking about. The book spends a lot of time complaining

124
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,760
about the violence at BLM protests, often casting BLM and Antifa as the villains. For it to turn

125
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,960
around with this nonsense as though they're the ones truly venerating Martin Luther King Jr.

126
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:48,160
is a bit strange. Here's what he said about violent protests back in the 1967 speech,

127
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:56,480
the other America. I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air.

128
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously

129
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:13,680
as we condemn riots, but in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard.

130
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,720
The Babylon Bee takes violence at Black Lives Matter demonstrations as the perfect chance to

131
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,720
compare demonstrators in BLM to the Ku Klux Klan, and then makes a joke about Satan being a part of

132
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,480
BLM. And they do all of this while pretending to revere the civil rights movements of the 1960s.

133
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,160
I guess this is the part where the joke is supposed to be making the left angry. Obviously,

134
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,120
this is an offensive thing. But when you look at these jokes, would you have been upset had I not

135
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,320
explain the context here? And that's where they fail. This very lame graphic of Satan being in

136
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,080
BLM is so boring that when I read it the first time, it barely elicited an eye roll. You really

137
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:55,200
have to take a moment to consider the context and think about these jokes to realize the racism on

138
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:00,000
display here. One of the failures of this book is that it does say some offensive stuff, but it's

139
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,800
so lazy and uninspired that it can't even get that offended reaction without some left-wing

140
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,280
YouTuber taking a few minutes to explain the context of why this joke is so offensive. If you

141
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,400
need me to do the job of angering the left over your lame comedy, you're failing pretty hard at

142
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:19,120
it. The guys at the Babylon Bee get their guffaws from how the mainstream media sometimes fact

143
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:24,080
checks their work. They assume this is because the left is too stupid to notice that it's satire,

144
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,560
which isn't really the case. Part of the reason it needs to be fact checked is because,

145
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,720
to some degree, their own audience believes some of this stuff is true. Here are some real

146
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,720
reviews I found of the book from its Goodreads page. I've been doing a fair amount of reading

147
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:42,720
and research on wokeness recently as I'm teaching a bible class on the topic for my congregation,

148
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:47,280
and as I say, I was particularly struck by the fact that the Bee's Guide to Wokeness,

149
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:52,080
for all its humorous parody and satire, offers a pretty good summary overview of what wokeness

150
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,840
really is and entails. It's so funny because it is so true. Defining and explaining wokeness is

151
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:02,560
extremely funny because it is nonsensical. This should replace many college textbooks.

152
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,280
It would be cheaper and much more direct. Be prepared to be hashtag more woke. Yes,

153
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:12,080
it's hashtag satire, so this is a funny and, sadly too often, true book.

154
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,440
In research done by Ohio State University, they found that not only are right-wing readers more

155
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,840
likely to believe ideas that the Babylon Bee packages as satire, they're more likely to believe

156
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,960
them than left-wing audiences will believe a satirical story from The Onion. The Babylon Bee

157
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,200
has fired back at this study, claiming it to be flawed in that it didn't present the headlines

158
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,680
of its stories verbatim, but the story used the same technique for The Onion headlines,

159
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,800
and it also misses the point being made. What this study reveals is that right-wing audiences

160
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,520
are more prone to see truth in this type of satire. It's not unlike how certain audiences

161
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:50,000
would look at sitcom characters such as Archie Bunker or Al Bundy as heroes when they were

162
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,720
supposed to be mocked. At least in those cases, though, the jokes were actually funny.

163
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,440
Also, if you want to learn about Al Bundy being a hero, check out my video on Married

164
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,320
with Children. Why not? The link's down below. Anyway, back to this.

165
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,000
I wish I had a clever transition for this, but I don't. Here's another stupid thing

166
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,960
in the Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness. It's the worst drawing I've ever seen of Elon Musk.

167
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,600
All artists deserve to get paid, and whoever drew this deserves to be paid with

168
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,280
a free copy of this book. That would be a fitting, ironic punishment.

169
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,720
Another way this book really hurts itself is when it more or less gives away how it

170
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,880
writes a bunch of its jokes with its Oppression Identifier Generator.

171
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:28,320
Let's play it quickly and see what we get. We'll use the name of a stupid dead person

172
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:38,560
so not to offend anyone. Rush Hudson Limpaugh. He would be a crazy-eyed pansexual Calvinist

173
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,880
with bear lungs. Yeah. Post your own Babylon Bee joke name in the comments. The first person to

174
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,360
laugh has to unsubscribe from my channel. The book then offers a few examples of this game

175
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,120
being played out with some helpful drawings, and this is really how a lot of Babylon Bee

176
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,920
humor works. Just string together random words like it's mad libs, and vaguely gesture at how

177
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,320
the left cares about too many different kinds of victimhood. This tactic combines itself with

178
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:10,400
another internet content favorite, and that's lists. Lots and lots of lists. A list of oppressed

179
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,640
religions, a list of good and bad countries, a list of things that are racist, a list of things

180
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:19,120
leftists do and don't think are important, a list of language not to use, a list of black people

181
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,840
the left hates, a list of ways to stop being white, and a list for spotting hidden racism.

182
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,360
And those are just the lists before Chapter 3. These lists are a convenient way to not actually

183
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,600
write jokes, while a small number, such as the list for spotting hidden racism, actually make

184
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:38,560
an effort. The rest are just some words that are meant to be instantly hilarious. Here's an example

185
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,000
under a list of racist things. They include drinking milk. Because it's white. That's the

186
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,600
whole joke there. It could have been anything white really. Building a snowman, using shaving foam,

187
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,920
blowing your nose with a tissue, drawing on a blank piece of paper, or painting a room white.

188
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,440
I'm halfway through making another list, and all I had to do was spend one minute looking around

189
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,480
my apartment and glancing out the window. This is a very lazy book. Another thing I noticed in this

190
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,560
book is it doesn't seem to understand how Venn diagrams work. Here's an example I found that

191
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,960
shows how each circle represents a quality an animal can have. An example of those animals when

192
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,400
those circles intersect. This is just how Venn diagrams work. Here's one from the Babylon

193
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,960
Bee Guide to Wokeness. It supposedly describes how intersectionalism works, and I gather the joke

194
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:25,040
here is that it's not supposed to make sense, and that the left-wing people who believe this are too

195
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,080
dumb to put it together. That's why the intersection of nationality and the power of flight is...

196
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:36,480
werewolf. It's not really a joke, because none of those things are really connected, and overlapping

197
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,600
nationality and the power of flight producing werewolf is just a weird on sequitur. It's mad

198
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,080
libs all over again. Throw random words together, point at the bad group, and say this is what they

199
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:50,560
really believe. And if the person making this joke doesn't understand how to use these visual graphics,

200
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,360
they can instead flip that around and say it's also satire. You might say that this whole book

201
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:00,160
is some kind of deeply clever psych out that I'm not getting. That the seemingly lazy and thoughtless

202
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,320
jokes are all a parody of the left, and since they're being sarcastic, any criticism directed

203
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:10,080
towards them is deflected onto the group they're parroting instead. Except the lazy hypothesis

204
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:15,680
extends beyond this book. Before the Babylon Bee slid firmly into right-wing culture war stuff,

205
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:20,480
it was primarily a comedy website making fun of the excesses of religious communities. For example,

206
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:24,960
they would run articles with headlines such as, there's a 15, maybe 20% chance I'll remember to

207
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,960
pray for you, brother. It does still touch on religion today, though it doesn't quite get the

208
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,960
same love and attention that the culture war stuff does. In the Babylon Bee's Guide to Wokeness,

209
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:37,120
I paid special attention to its chapter on religion. The whole section feels like a bit

210
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:41,600
of a reach, as the left isn't really known for its religious zeal, but it does have a go at

211
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:46,000
claiming the left is trying to reframe Jesus as woke, and is trying to turn churches into

212
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,800
left-wing project centers. It also takes lazy, partisan political swipes. Here's one example

213
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,160
in the section explaining how woke Jesus is. When Lazarus died, Jesus raised him from the dead so he

214
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,960
could vote Democrat. Jesus performed this miracle a few times, raising hordes of people from the

215
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,640
dead and leading them straight over to the voting booth so they could cast their vote for a

216
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,200
Democratic candidate. Democrats are following in his footsteps, and are still performing this

217
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,480
miracle today. This is another example of what this book constantly does, mushing together basic

218
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,440
liberal actions with radical movements. Voting for the Democrats in an election is preferable

219
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,920
to the alternative, but it's hardly the type of radical left-wing politics this book is claiming

220
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:28,480
to lampoon. The important part here is that this section reflects the book's obvious partisan

221
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,640
leanings. It's about attacking the left on all front, from radical politics to electoralism.

222
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,360
It's a flattening of perspectives to make lazy jokes. The main point here is that this book is

223
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,720
trying to portray the left as co-opting Christianity to advance its political agenda. That was most

224
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,200
apparent at the end of this chapter when it references The Screwtape Letters, a novel written

225
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,600
by C.S. Lewis that's presented as a collection of letters from a senior demon named Screwtape

226
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,800
sent to his nephew Wormwood. The Babylon B book highlights this specific excerpt from the novel.

227
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,560
We do want, and want very much, to make men treat Christianity as a means, preferably of course as

228
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:08,240
a means to their own advancement, but, failing that, as a means to anything, even to social justice.

229
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,760
The thing to do is to get a man at first to value social justice as a thing which the enemy demands,

230
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,480
and then work him on to the stage at which he values Christianity because it may produce social

231
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,120
justice, for the enemy will not be used as a convenience. It's making the same point as the

232
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,640
chapter that the left is co-opting the church to further its political project, which is

233
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:31,200
inappropriate since a church should not be used as a tool for one's politics. You might be wondering

234
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,600
how the Democratic Party is particularly guilty of this when you're far more likely to see those in

235
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,800
the Republican Party invoke God and Christian piety. I found this exact C.S. Lewis quote in

236
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,120
another book, though, written in a similar sarcastic tone, only it took a slightly different

237
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,280
approach. Here's an excerpt that followed the reading of this Screwtape passage.

238
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,840
Christianity should only be valued insofar as it helps us win political battles and shape the

239
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:58,720
social landscape. What's the point of having the power of God in the Gospel and the indwelling Holy

240
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,640
Spirit if we don't use it to our advantage, such as winning the White House, the Supreme Court,

241
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,880
and the Congress for our political party and advancing our own hot-button social issues?

242
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:11,200
It's the best of both worlds. We get to hang out with our homeboy Jesus, but we still get the

243
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,920
recognition and accolades of the world. So what are you waiting for? Get on over to the nearest GOP

244
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:20,560
campaign office and start getting involved. While the Guide to Wokeness uses the C.S. Lewis

245
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:25,040
quote to mock the left for being the one to mix politics and religion, this particular book flips

246
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:29,440
the equation to call out the right for doing the same thing. And this mystery book I'm talking

247
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,720
about happens to be How to Be a Perfect Christian, your comprehensive guide to flawless spiritual

248
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,320
living written by, would you look at that, the Babylon Bee. How to Be a Perfect Christian was

249
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,520
written all the way back in 2019, and I guess a lot can change in two years because reading this

250
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,320
first book you find excerpts like these. The Democratic Party was founded in 1883 as the

251
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,320
dying wish of Karl Marx because he wanted to infiltrate the once God-fearing nation with his

252
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,600
evil communist ideas. Did I mention this book was written with the same sort of sarcastic tone that

253
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,320
the Guide to Wokeness was? How to Be a Perfect Christian also hits us with one of their signature

254
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:11,520
lazy lists. Helpful terms for arguing with Democrats online. Libtard. Snowflake. I'm not

255
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:17,920
a racist, but... Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Food stamp junkie. Godless commie.

256
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:22,400
One of these really sticks out, and that's I'm not a racist, but, and let's contrast this with

257
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:27,760
a little excerpt from the Guide to Wokeness. This comes from its list of secret signs of racism.

258
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,960
Three, you say I'm not a racist. This is an obvious one. If you say I'm not a racist,

259
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,200
or I don't hate people for their skin color, you are definitely a racist. Because guess what?

260
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,240
That's exactly what a racist would say. The irony here of course is that the first book mocks how

261
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,440
the right often portrays the left as a caricature, and then the second book just embraces the

262
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,720
caricature, acting like the very people the first book was mocking. Here's another fun excerpt from

263
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,920
How to Be a Perfect Christian. But we do have a word of warning for you, brave Christian Republican

264
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:02,560
soldier. The most important thing you can remember as you bravely head off to the front lines to fight

265
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:07,760
for Jesus in the culture wars is this. You are always being persecuted. The Guide to Wokeness,

266
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,800
of course, makes a number of references to Christians being persecuted, such as this excerpt.

267
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,880
But whatever religion you pick, make sure it's an oppressed, exotic, unique belief system that you

268
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,360
can score you woke points, and not something basic and lame like Christianity. If you must be a

269
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,200
Christian though, because your lame parents make you go to church as long as you live under their

270
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,160
floor or whatever, co-opt Christianity for social justice. The only good church is a woke church.

271
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,520
You can see the style here hasn't really evolved. It's all done with the same sort of sarcastic

272
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,160
roleplay of the group they're trying to mock. Where the Babylon B stands becomes a bit tougher

273
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:45,200
to figure out when you compare these two books. The jokes still aren't terribly funny, but this

274
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,280
book does actually go pretty hard against Republicans for about a chapter, complaining

275
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,200
about how they co-opt religion to advance their political goals. It even mocks conservative

276
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,600
icons such as Ronald Reagan, Rush Limbaugh, and Bill O'Reilly. How to Be a Perfect Christian

277
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:02,960
is about how Christianity is used by disingenuous people in order to feel smugly superior. And the

278
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,200
Guide to Wokeness, the chapter on religion is making the same point, only now it's claiming

279
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:11,920
the left is doing this, and not the right. You might assume this is the Babylon B claiming to

280
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,800
not really be a partisan political operation, not choosing one side over the other. Only that

281
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,000
isn't true. The Guide to Wokeness is absolutely advancing a partisan political project. Whereas

282
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,120
the How to Be a Perfect Christian has one chapter about partisan politics, instead mostly focusing

283
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,080
on criticizing superficial acts of faith, the Guide to Wokeness is explicitly an anti-left book,

284
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:36,960
with nods of appreciation to the right. It is clearly chosen a side here. You might be wondering

285
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:41,360
how this happened. And it may not be as simple as the Babylon B writers being a bunch of lazy,

286
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,360
soulless grifters who recycle jokes to make easy money from a gullible audience.

287
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:50,000
How to Be a Perfect Christian was written by Adam Ford and Kyle Mann. In late 2018,

288
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,560
Ford, who had founded the website, sold it to Seth Dillon and moved on to other projects. So

289
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:58,240
while Ford still has a financial stake in the outlet he created, he doesn't have any role in

290
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,720
producing its content. So it's quite possible that Ford's voice, which may have included critiques of

291
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,760
hypocritical Christians on the political right, is just no longer part of the Babylon B's output.

292
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,920
Though that doesn't stop them from bringing up the same points he does, right down to the same

293
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:16,640
C.S. Lewis quote, and lazily flipping those jokes to be about the other side of the political aisle.

294
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:21,600
Or it's possible that the same set of jokes came from How to Be a Perfect Christian's other author,

295
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:26,240
Kyle Mann, who still works at the Babylon B and also is one of the co-authors of The Guide to

296
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,320
Wokeness. And he'll make the same lame jokes about anyone so long as he's getting paid.

297
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,640
Speaking to The Atlantic, Mann described the joy he gets from his humor like this.

298
00:24:51,600 --> 00:25:18,080
His point doesn't really make sense here because saying something isn't funny isn't really the same

299
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:23,600
as being upset. If anything, it's absence of a reaction, not laughing, and then informing the

300
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,560
person telling the joke that it sucks. But I want to focus on the point about how the Babylon B is

301
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,840
making some kind of meta-commentary, ironically mocking boomer jokes, a special in-joke that

302
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,640
only they're getting. But if they are mocking boomer jokes, it's not even consistent with an

303
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,680
earlier comment from that same interview where this exchange happened.

304
00:25:48,080 --> 00:26:11,440
The Babylon B is an unapologetic outlet for boomer humor. Except when you point out how

305
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,400
bad their jokes are, then they're actually mocking boomer humor. Regardless of how they defend their

306
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,120
weak humor though, The Babylon B's Guide to Wokeness is a deeply lazy book. Recycling jokes

307
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,120
throughout its run, some borrowed from memes that are nearly five years old, doing the bare minimum

308
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,240
to vaguely gestured humor with effortless lists, and in some cases reusing jokes from books they

309
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,560
published a few years ago. Going back to the Heartland Institute, The Guide to Wokeness' co-author

310
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:39,360
Joel Berry said, the book only took a few months to write, which sounds, if anything, slightly

311
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,040
longer than I would have guessed. Here's one particular part of the interview I enjoyed.

312
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:54,000
We do these kind of funny corporate art style stick figure infographics where we're

313
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:02,240
explaining how to do something silly. We wanted a kind of a light, silly critique that is substantive.

314
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:10,160
We did our research and we wanted to make it accurate and insightful if you want to read it

315
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,640
cover to cover. But it's also just something you can pick up and there's going to be a joke,

316
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,640
no matter what page you turn to, a funny picture. And it's just silly, you know,

317
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:22,560
we felt like people needed to laugh at this whole movement. And let's go back to how to be a perfect

318
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:28,240
Christian one last time. The best way to engage in conversation with those of opposing worldviews is

319
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,040
to misrepresent their positions using a hilarious meme or graphic and then plaster it all over the

320
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:40,160
internet. I hope the irony isn't lost on anyone. A few of my patrons had questions about this video

321
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:45,040
and I want to answer them here. A few people asked me if there was any part of this or any part of

322
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:51,360
the Babylombie's output that I found genuinely humorous. That's a very good and challenging

323
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:56,960
question to answer. I think the closest I got to laughing is in its list of handy tips for being

324
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,440
less white. They aren't great jokes, but they reveal a level of self-awareness that shows

325
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:09,120
an actual familiarity about stereotypes around white people. Smash your Taylor Swift albums or

326
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:13,520
buy hot sauce or donate your new balances to goodwill. With a little effort, these could have

327
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,960
been good jokes. They're sort of mediocre otherwise. They are the closest I got to laughing

328
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:25,120
though, so that was something. Another person asked if a real human being has ever genuinely

329
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:31,760
laughed at a joke delivered by Greg Gutfeld. Probably not. Probably not. Another question asked

330
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:37,040
was, is there a way for conservative humor to be good? And I think, yeah, probably. The problem is

331
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:42,400
conservative audiences should be more demanding, I hope, and I think it takes a real effort to make

332
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,880
people who disagree with you politically laugh, and that effort simply isn't there amongst

333
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:53,040
conservative comedians who can just play to these very easy, basic narratives and not really work on

334
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,760
creating meaningful or good jokes. Like the aforementioned list of things people can do to

335
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,320
stop being white, there were some ideas there that could have been fashioned into real joke if even

336
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,440
some kind of effort was put into it. And I do think left-wingers can fall into the same exact

337
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,560
trap of creating cheap jokes but still getting a laugh out of them because they're targeted at

338
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:17,040
the right person. If you would like to ask some questions to possibly get them answered at the end

339
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,400
of a video, maybe you should become a patron too. At the very least, you'd get your name in the

340
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:24,480
credits, early access to videos, and other fun bonuses. If you'd like to support this video in

341
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,560
a non-monetary fashion, you can like, comment, subscribe, or ring the bell if you haven't already.

342
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,640
Thank you all so much for watching. A big thanks to Zoe B and Chill Goblin

343
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,800
