0	7680	Viewer discretion is advised. The following video includes clips of Steven Crowder, and I've done my best to screen out as many of his bad jokes as I could.
13920	15920	In the lead up to the
15960	21080	2020 American election, rumors swirl about the security of the vote and the potential for fraud.
21160	28960	Most of these rumors came out of the mouth of President Trump and were rapidly parroted by right-wing press and general bootlickers in the alternative media.
28960	37280	The only way we're gonna lose this election is if the election is rigged. Remember that. It's the only way we're gonna lose this election.
37280	47520	On election night, people were primed to find all sorts of irregularities in the voting process, and by God, some voices in the online space were gonna find evidence even if they had to make it up themselves.
47520	56800	One tactic, employed quite heavily, was a favorite of conspiracy theorists called just asking questions, or jacking off if you want to say it in a sex way.
56960	63120	It shouldn't be confused with asking questions in general, which is completely valid and something I wholeheartedly support.
63120	74400	The just asking questions technique uses the practice of asking leading questions to shift the burden of proof away from the question asker to make their evidence-free claims appear more convincing.
74400	81200	One prominent example of this is the exhausting five-hour stream on the Steven Crowder YouTube channel titled,
81200	89920	Live updates. Democrats try to steal election? Good morning, hashtag mug club, airing on November 4th, the day after the election.
89920	98800	Before you ask, yes, I watched all five hours. I know I don't want to talk about how often I felt myself slip into the abyss of madness.
98800	101520	Head for the gudgeon of madness.
101520	105360	The stream bounds back and forth between different questions it has about the election.
105360	114720	These questions, instead of being properly investigated, are used to fuel the conspiracy theory that victory in the 2020 presidential election was stolen from Donald Trump.
114720	124560	One aspect of the just asking questions strategy is to ask questions in a number of ways, ignoring any answers you might get unless it's the answer an asker is actually after.
124560	131360	In this stream, that technique is best represented by the questions raised around ballots filled out with sharpies.
131360	141040	In Arizona, the use of Sharpie pins was causing some ballots to be invalidated, and it could be pretty big numbers, mostly for Trump supporters.
141040	147120	So the people that were in front of me, there were two people in front of me that used the Sharpie that was given to them by the poll workers.
147120	155920	It did not read their ballot, and they flooded in there twice. I used the pen, took their Sharpie and threw it away, and it read your ballot.
155920	160960	So what they're doing is they're telling people to use the Sharpies that way those votes aren't counted.
160960	162320	That's exactly what's happening.
162320	170240	Truly shocking stuff. You would think these criminal masterminds wouldn't feed these votes into the counting machines in front of the voters, letting them see them fail.
170240	174320	But apparently, that's what happened, according to this random video taken from the internet.
174320	178320	And I'm not sure how they figured out who is or isn't a Trump voter before they actually vote.
178320	184960	Still, the question is raised, and that's the most important part, getting us to question whether or not votes written with Sharpies are being counted.
184960	188640	And as the stream rolled along, that question changed along with it.
188640	196960	We supposedly have even more evidence here from Maricopa County saying Sharpies are okay, but also not okay on their official voting ballot.
196960	204400	And then if you look at the actual election ballot, it's a little dark, but it says do not use a Sharpie type pen as it will bleed through.
204400	209680	Pretty damning, huh? And wow, these guys just hate it when people don't take their claim seriously.
209680	216320	People that get really upset and say, oh, this is unconfirmed or this is a conspiracy theory. It's like, okay, well, let's let's look into it.
216320	226320	Excellent point, Reg. And in the time it took you to go on that little rant, I decided to look up the phone number printed on that voting ballot and found out it is in fact from Arizona, but not Maricopa County.
226320	235120	It's for the Elections Committee in Pima County. And had any attempts been made to reach Pima County election officials, they might have found this tweet speaking on the issue.
235120	242720	Arizona ballot tabulating machines can read ballots marked with a felt tip pen. Felt pens are discouraged because the ink can bleed through.
242720	248160	If it does bleed through, the ballot will most likely get sent for duplication so it can be read by the scanner.
248160	252880	All ballots in which voter intent can be discerned will be counted. That's also in the manual.
252880	257360	No ballots will be discarded because of the method used to color in the ovals.
257360	266720	Assuming Maricopa County's process is similar to Pima County, these tweets would also explain why the girl in the Twitter video saw the ballots of people who aren't her not go through the machine.
266720	272400	It's not that their votes weren't counted at all. It's that they had to be duplicated by hand and scan through the machine again.
272400	276560	But just to be safe, we should still ask, can people use Sharpies in Maricopa County?
276560	281680	If you take a few seconds to go to their election department website, you'll find this helpful little video.
281680	287920	Did you know you can use a black or blue pen or Sharpie to fill out your ballot in Maricopa County?
287920	297040	At the vote center, you may notice fine tip Sharpies are used. That's because it's the fastest drying ink and works best on the tabulation equipment.
297040	301920	If Crowder and his buddies had taken time to look into this adequately, they could have put this question to bed.
301920	305520	Instead, questions about Sharpies persist throughout the stream.
305520	310560	A good two hours after first bringing up Sharpies, they finally find some random people on Twitter countering their claim.
310560	318720	You know, some Twitter users were saying that they filled it out with Sharpie and called them, the Arizona voting station, and said, hey, did you count my ballot or not?
318720	322480	And they said, yes, those do get counted, but not till later. So, you know, who knows?
322480	325360	But this answer to their question is ignored an hour later.
325360	331040	I got two different text messages from people on the ground, one in Michigan in Livonia, which I think is...
331040	332320	I know Livonia very well.
332320	342320	Okay, another in Macomb County, also in Michigan, two different people have said they personally voted they were given Sharpies and told to vote in those jurisdictions.
342320	350480	Whether or not those votes were counted is beside the point. They just want to confirm that Sharpie use is widespread so they can modify their questions about Sharpies,
350480	357600	broadening the idea that this is a serious problem that needs to be investigated, even though they're not really providing any more evidence.
357600	363440	And yes, I absolutely mean they're trying to birth the conspiracy theory here, best exemplified by this clip.
363440	368560	And if we can find even a handful of places that we're using Sharpies, that is systemic.
368560	374960	They know better than to give you Sharpies. They know that you should not be voting with Sharpies and that makes it easy to manipulate votes.
374960	380800	And at the very least, any ballots that have Sharpies should be discounted and there should be a recount with those.
380800	387360	Systemic use of Sharpies. All ballots using Sharpies should be discounted and trigger a recount.
387360	391120	That's an amazing jump based on a single video on Twitter.
391120	397280	Eventually, they find a day-old tweet from Maricopa County, which I remind you is where the original Twitter video was filmed.
397280	407280	There's a Maricopa County elections tweet from 23 hours ago saying that they can use Sharpies because they have new offset columns on the ballots, which will prevent bleed through.
407280	414880	OK, so we want to be accurate, but that kind of contradicts what the video from the two voters in Arizona were saying, right?
414880	416800	It was not going through for them.
416800	421440	Well, they were saying that in Arizona, but now we're talking about Missouri and we're talking about other places.
421440	429760	Any answers that were acknowledged were only used to change the question because Crowder wants a specific answer and he'll keep changing the question until he gets it.
429760	435120	May not be a huge deal, but when you combine all of this together, Sharpie, Sharpie, Sharpie, Sharpie.
435120	449840	Steven Crowder took a single video from Twitter, one that, at best, claims voting machines can't read ballots marked with Sharpies and turns it into a countrywide conspiracy about election workers handing out Sharpies to spoil ballots.
449840	453920	It's not happening. And if it was, he wouldn't need to ask questions.
453920	456800	He'd just show us the evidence and that would be the end of it.
456800	461760	News flash. We have another case of potential voter fraud hot off the press.
461760	467280	They were transporting votes by coolers in Michigan late at night.
467280	472000	I am concerned, panicked and shaken to my very bones.
472000	475520	All right. I'm coming in because I just wanted to check and make sure this is verified.
475520	478560	Oh, thank goodness. Before making themselves look like idiots,
478560	483280	Steven Crowder is on the scene, making sure all of this is on the up and up.
483280	488000	I mean, you just you wouldn't be able to trust that just because some ballots could fly off the back.
488000	491600	That's a guy in a WrestleMania t-shirt with a KB toys wagon.
491600	493760	And another exclusive for Steven Crowder.
493760	500560	He interviews the woman who captured this video of a guy wheeling this mysterious red wagon into a vote counting center.
500560	502400	And the concern was just the security concern.
502400	509280	We don't really know what was going on with or what items they were bringing in or who was going in or any of those things.
509280	514960	The video didn't show us any ballots and the person recording it says they don't know what was in those containers.
514960	519360	Yet they still feel comfortable saying that these were, in fact, ballots.
519360	523120	Right now, what we're seeing is people bringing in by themselves with no security,
523120	528240	red wagons and Coleman coolers, bringing them behind the glass area where no one has access.
528240	532720	He seems to be fishing for a very specific allegation.
532720	533920	What, I guess, is your concern.
533920	536080	They could be walking in with what? With fake ballots?
536080	538400	They could just I mean, absolutely.
538400	539520	Oh, and there he gets it.
539520	544000	He had to hold her hand very tightly, but he got her to say what he needed her to say.
544000	550160	That fake ballots are being surreptitiously brought into the voting centers for liability reasons.
550160	551680	He's not the one making the claim.
551680	554000	The person he's interviewing is.
554000	556640	It's a fun little microcosm of what he does with his viewers.
556640	561280	He leads them down a conspiracy theory garden path, points them towards a conclusion,
561280	564080	and lets them make the jump for themselves.
564080	565600	He never made the accusation.
565600	571120	He was just asking questions so we can't hold him responsible for getting this completely wrong.
571120	571840	But you know what?
571840	575520	I am going to hold him completely responsible because it was his shoddy investigation that
575520	584320	required this lovely response from local news station WXYZ, or I guess for Americans WXYZ.
584320	586000	I don't know, one of those.
586000	588400	And as a seven action news representative,
588400	591040	I would have gladly told her that it was a box full of batteries.
591040	594080	Who would have guessed that someone for the group Lawyers for Trump
594080	596240	might have some kind of political agenda?
596240	598640	Of course, this news story came out after the stream,
598640	601200	so Crowder couldn't have known his ridiculous questions
601280	602640	had such an easy answer.
602640	604240	But that didn't stop him from broadcasting
604240	608640	speculation that these were ballots to advance the election theft conspiracy theory.
609200	614000	If we look at that video, we can't tell what's in that wagon, and neither can Crowder.
614000	616160	There's no reason to believe these are ballots,
616160	619520	but that ambiguity was enough cover to let him ask the question.
619520	623280	What reason does Crowder have to think these are ballots and not, say,
623280	625600	a late night snack for the vote counters?
625600	628640	Or maybe office supplies to help them manage all that paperwork?
628640	630640	And in reality, they were something else entirely.
630720	631440	They were batteries.
632160	635040	None of these possibilities are even raised.
635040	637520	The only questions Crowder was interested in asking
637520	642080	were leading questions to continue raising doubts on the results of the election.
642080	643760	Okay, so that's two duds.
643760	647920	But what other very serious questions does Crowder have about this election?
647920	649680	What? Is that commonplace?
649680	650560	Can someone let me know?
650560	653200	That's a video from the inside of the guy, yeah.
653200	655200	Oh yes, this was a very concerning question.
655200	659120	How can you have transparency when windows outside are being covered up?
659120	662160	Maybe if there was some kind of presence of the media there,
662160	664640	or monitors from the Biden and Trump campaigns?
665360	666720	Oh, what's that?
666720	668880	There's evidence that those people were there?
668880	671680	Oh, and if we look at the footage from the video that was shown to us,
671680	673040	we can see them right there.
673040	674960	Oh, that was easy.
674960	678000	Also, the video is like, where did they think that was coming from?
678000	680080	Obviously, there are people inside recording things
680080	683920	if the recording people put up giant pieces of Bristol board.
684800	686640	Yeah, this one didn't really work out.
686640	691120	Let's see what the official reason from the city is for the covering of windows.
691120	695520	This comes from Lawrence Garcia, an attorney for the city of Detroit.
695520	698240	Some, but not all, windows were covered.
698240	701920	Because poll workers seated just inside those windows expressed concerns
701920	706000	about people outside the center photographing and filming them and their work.
706000	709200	Only the media is allowed to take pictures inside the counting place,
709200	712160	and people outside the center were not listening to requests
712160	714720	to stop filming poll workers and their paperwork.
714800	717200	This concern over windows being covered up
717200	721360	happened in the midst of the discussion about the nefarious red wagon.
721360	724080	One of the methods that keeps conspiracy theories alive
724080	726960	is this tendency to constantly generate new questions
726960	729600	to create the impression that evidence is mounting.
729600	733120	Throughout the stream, Crowder frequently brings up the mysterious case
733120	737440	of over 100,000 votes suddenly being added to the Biden tally in Michigan.
737440	743120	This update of Biden getting 100% of new votes, 128,000 or more,
743280	745280	just in one chunk with zero for Trump.
745280	748560	Which they mentioned was reported as an error and eventually corrected.
748560	751200	And here's another sudden vote change they thought in Michigan.
751200	753440	In the reviewing the numbers and said their discrepancies,
753440	758960	it seems like the numbers were transposed that they got Trump's numbers in Biden switched.
758960	760960	Right, and so he said they'll be corrected soon.
761520	766400	Pretty damn suspicious if you ignore that these errors were corrected during the election,
766400	767040	of course.
767040	772000	I think it's fair to assume that during an election involving millions of people voting
772000	776240	with thousands of voting centers across 50 different states,
776240	778240	a few errors might happen.
778240	781200	But Crowder has noticed a sinister pattern.
781200	783680	And all of this tomfoolery happened after 4 a.m.
783680	787120	and every single one of these major errors in these swing states
787120	788480	happened to favor Biden.
788480	793360	This is actually a decent point, but it also raises a contradictory question.
793360	796480	Are there any examples of suspicious circumstances
796480	798560	that worked against the Biden campaign?
798560	801200	Perhaps we listen to this clip for a few more seconds.
802080	803440	It broke a long time ago.
803440	805920	Of mail-in ballots were not delivered.
805920	809680	So, for example, in Philadelphia, 33.7 percent.
809680	812160	Oh, ballots aren't being delivered in Philadelphia.
812160	814960	Sounds like another one of those suspicious errors.
814960	817680	It could be another attempt to sabotage the Trump campaign.
819920	822000	Why would you say that, Steven?
822000	825600	Oh, all the votes in Philadelphia were going for Biden.
825600	828720	Okay, so that's one error against the Biden campaign.
828720	830480	Oh, and here's another error.
830560	834640	The Arizona had reportedly counted 95 percent of its vote.
834640	838480	And then New York Times noted that, oh, due to an error,
838480	840960	the actual number is only 86 percent.
840960	842960	This morning, the Trump campaign said, you know,
842960	846160	we think when all the votes are counted, we're going to pull ahead in Arizona.
846160	848480	I could easily frame these as mysterious votes
848480	851840	that come out of nowhere to support one candidate over another.
851840	855280	In truth, they were just mail-in votes that hadn't been counted yet.
855280	859040	Strange that Crowder forgot about this example from his own stream,
859040	862640	especially since this one was talked about 40 minutes before he even said,
862640	867040	Every single one of these major errors in these swing states happen to favor Biden.
867040	870480	The fact is, errors affected both candidates,
870480	874480	but Crowder is only paying attention to one side that's affected by them,
874480	879200	raising questions that portray the Trump campaign as victims of election theft.
879200	882000	There were some other irregularities pointed out on this stream,
882000	885280	such as votes mysteriously appearing in Kenosha.
885360	889920	We had 60 percent for Donald Trump to 38 percent for Biden.
889920	893440	And then all of a sudden it shrunk to 50, 47.
893440	897120	Again, the same county, the same county.
897120	898400	How does that happen?
898400	901440	This was because of mail-in ballots heavily favoring Biden,
901440	906160	thanks to Trump constantly encouraging his supporters to vote person rather than by mail.
906160	909840	And over 50 percent of voters in Kenosha ended up voting by mail.
909840	913680	After counting those votes, they decided to add them to the total all at once.
914320	919440	23,000 votes in Philadelphia, all for Biden.
919440	921280	That doesn't happen.
921280	924560	23,277, all.
924560	926480	Can you maybe take this one, Reg?
926480	929040	Yeah, unless there's some strange way that they're just
929600	933920	reporting for one candidate at a time, that doesn't make any sense.
933920	935520	Yeah, that's exactly what happened.
935520	936560	No need to wonder about it.
936560	940880	This is easily verifiable since a number of votes were reported all at once for Trump
940880	943200	a short time after the Biden numbers came in.
943200	946800	Not as many, of course, because he didn't get as many votes as Biden.
946800	948000	Because he lost.
948000	951120	I'm starting to run out of energy trying to answer all these questions
951120	954240	because the sheer volume of them is so high in this stream
954240	957520	and they do such a poor job of trying to honestly answer them.
957520	959920	Even when they stumble onto an answer during the stream,
959920	963680	they're quickly discarded so Crowder can hit home the point that matters the most.
963680	968160	That if all these questions are raised, something fishy must be going on.
968160	970960	Blitzing someone with so many questions that they might not notice
971040	973840	there's no actual evidence to support the idea that
973840	977760	this election is illegitimate or was stolen by the Democrats.
977760	980720	And I have one more sweet morsel of a question for everyone.
980720	985440	A piece of evidence so bad that even Steven Crowder can't stand by it.
985440	988400	This is something that is being sent to us right now on Twitter as a video.
988400	992480	I have no idea if it's true or not, but several people are circulating this.
992480	994000	Do we have the clip? Let's roll it.
997120	997620	You know.
997940	1003060	Oh Trump, you got to do what you got to do.
1004580	1005060	Crimes.
1011060	1012260	I've got around 80.
1017220	1018420	I don't know if this is real.
1019300	1020020	Yeah, I don't know.
1020020	1022100	We didn't necessarily to run that because we have something more authentic,
1022100	1024660	but we have something that's actually authentic afterwards.
1024660	1026420	But that wouldn't surprise me that that's been going on.
1026420	1028420	Crowder isn't convinced it's real.
1028420	1032340	It isn't, by the way, all those papers being burned are sample ballots, not real ones.
1032340	1036180	But Crowder saying that it wouldn't surprise him if this sort of thing was happening
1036180	1037860	is just shocking.
1037860	1041460	Unlike other questions, which rest on ambiguous claims or videos,
1041460	1047460	Crowder raises the question without even pretending that this video is anything other than bogus.
1047460	1050580	He uses it to present a general suspicion that
1050580	1054980	someone out there might be doing this based on a feeling he might be right.
1054980	1058340	This does not feel like a legitimate, it really doesn't feel like a legitimate
1058340	1060980	when there are too many things that just aren't adding up.
1060980	1061940	Are you convinced yet?
1062580	1068500	By the end of the stream, Crowder invites Congressman Dan Crenshaw on to voice some concerns.
1069220	1071460	Yeah, I mean, we just, we just have to know, right?
1072260	1077700	We see these anecdotes of potentially, you know, wrongful behavior.
1077700	1078980	We just have to know.
1078980	1080740	They just want to know.
1080740	1083460	And wanting to know is just a fancy way of saying,
1083540	1086900	they're just asking questions about the security of the election.
1086900	1091620	The reason they can only ask questions is because they have absolutely no evidence.
1091620	1094260	What few video clips and statements that have been shown
1094260	1099540	don't come anywhere near close to living up to the stream's title of Democrats stealing the
1099540	1104740	election, but all these questions are designed so it doesn't feel right to the audience.
1104740	1110100	Getting them to assume, on the basis of nothing, that this election isn't legitimate.
1110100	1114100	Pepper, throughout the stream, are a series of rants against the mainstream media,
1114100	1118260	parading them for not doing their job and not investigating these bogus claims.
1118260	1119780	Should you ask a question?
1119780	1121940	Yeah, should you ask any question?
1121940	1126820	Funnily enough, most of the ridiculous conspiracy theories presented in this stream were debunked
1126820	1132020	by said mainstream media, making it a lot easier for me to produce this video.
1132020	1136020	But my favorite bit in one of Crowder's rants is right here.
1136020	1142180	We always have to be so right because there's so much accountability because everyone is gunning
1142180	1146740	for, again, in the big powerful corporations for people who have opinions like ours.
1146740	1149460	They're just aching for a reason for us to be wrong.
1149460	1152180	This is such a delicious irony.
1152180	1156580	Steven Crowder was wrong about every single one of these suspicious incidents,
1156580	1160660	and the title of this stream is a lie about the Democrats trying to steal the election
1160660	1164020	and how he's complaining about mainstream media getting it wrong.
1164020	1168420	All his questions are terrible, and no one on mainstream media should be asking them
1168420	1172020	because there is no real evidence to support anything they're alleging.
1172020	1177620	And yet they're still the ones fact-checking Scarbage because people like him are spreading it out there.
1177620	1182420	But Jose, you may be saying, these are questions from over a week ago.
1182420	1185380	What about all these other new questions Crowder is asking?
1185380	1189940	If you're genuinely wondering that right now, you've missed the entire point of this video.
1189940	1194340	An infinite number of questions can be generated about any controversy.
1194340	1198340	You just find video or statements that could be considered ambiguous
1198340	1202420	and frame it as if it were part of some kind of grand conspiracy.
1202420	1207140	If you truly have evidence of voter fraud, you wouldn't need to ask questions.
1207140	1209540	You would just present the evidence.
1209540	1213380	The consequences for him being so wrong and spreading misinformation,
1213380	1215780	something he does on a regular basis,
1215780	1222900	he has a YouTube channel of 5 million subscribers and works with Glenn Beck's Blaze Media.
1222900	1226180	But he wants you to think he's the one being persecuted,
1226180	1230500	all while advancing Republican talking points and furthering the political agenda of the right.
1231460	1233380	It's a nice grift if you can get it.
1234100	1237620	And also sleep at night knowing that this is how you make a living.
1238180	1242340	If you take a quick look at my sources below, you'll notice that they come from a wide range
1242340	1246260	of outlets, big international ones and others are small local ones.
1246260	1250660	If you still think Crowder's claims have some validity, ask yourself this question.
1251220	1252180	What's more likely?
1252820	1257460	That dozens of different media outlets from across the United States, and in some cases
1257460	1262260	other parts of the world, are working in tandem to hide all evidence of this election being
1262260	1265460	tampered with via sharpies and mysterious red wagons?
1265460	1270740	Or is Steven Crowder full of crap and trying to cast out on an election with no real evidence?
1271540	1274500	And because I'm not a coward and actually brought real evidence,
1274500	1275380	I'll tell you the answer.
1275380	1276740	Steven Crowder is full of crap.
1278500	1281620	Originally, this video was about right-wing media more broadly,
1281620	1285540	and I had examples from Dave Rubin, Tim Pool pushing conspiracy theories.
1285540	1291140	But this Steven Crowder stream just encapsulated so much madness that I had to dive right into it.
1291140	1296660	If you're interested in seeing more right-wing conspiracy theory nonsense debunked,
