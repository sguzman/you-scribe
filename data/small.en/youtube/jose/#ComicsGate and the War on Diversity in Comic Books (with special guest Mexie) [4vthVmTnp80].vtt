00:00.000 --> 00:05.720
Have you ever read a comic where the hero fought an evil corporation or tyrannical government?

00:05.720 --> 00:13.040
Some might call storylines like these or images like these ones a subtle political statement.

00:13.040 --> 00:18.360
But others, however, can't or choose not to see any politics here.

00:18.360 --> 00:22.680
These are just colorful images of adventures unconnected to the world of politics.

00:22.680 --> 00:27.240
And if they start to see politics, that must be the product of some kind of sinister agenda

00:27.240 --> 00:29.880
to push the creator's beliefs onto people.

00:29.880 --> 00:36.160
The only politics in their mind that should be in comics are bland, centrist, mainstream

00:36.160 --> 00:37.160
opinions.

00:37.160 --> 00:41.800
Nothing that could be considered objectionable or outside the norm.

00:41.800 --> 00:44.680
Or at least, the norm is they see it.

00:44.680 --> 00:50.140
This crowd of complainers, which spawned movements such as Game or Gate, typically parade the

00:50.140 --> 00:53.440
mantra of having politics shove down their throat.

00:53.440 --> 00:58.880
And politics, in their mind, often includes diverse characters and the hiring of diverse

00:58.880 --> 01:02.640
characters, all to push a sinister progressive agenda.

01:02.640 --> 01:07.880
If the complaint is that the stories are bad, why not complain about the writing instead

01:07.880 --> 01:09.560
of the diversity?

01:09.560 --> 01:14.240
Maybe the problem really is because some people just don't like seeing diversity in their

01:14.240 --> 01:20.840
comics.

01:20.840 --> 01:26.240
Comics can be many things, from edgy underground political commentary to touching melodrama

01:26.240 --> 01:29.120
about the trials of growing up in a man's world.

01:29.120 --> 01:32.840
For the purposes of this video, though, we're going to be looking exclusively at the genre

01:32.840 --> 01:36.720
synonymous with comic books, and that's superheroes.

01:36.720 --> 01:40.680
That all started with Action Comics number one, the first appearance of Superman.

01:40.680 --> 01:44.920
In the coming decades, he would be followed by Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America,

01:44.920 --> 01:48.720
The Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and some other characters you may have heard

01:48.720 --> 01:49.720
of.

01:49.720 --> 01:52.720
And probably way, way more you haven't.

01:52.720 --> 01:55.880
You may have noticed one thing most of these characters have in common.

01:55.880 --> 01:59.960
The majority of them are men, and most of them are white.

01:59.960 --> 02:04.840
From the 1930s to the 1960s, the US was a very white place, and superhero comics were

02:04.840 --> 02:07.160
typically read by young boys.

02:07.160 --> 02:11.600
Publishers knew that these young boys enjoyed reading characters that looked like them.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.520
Publishers also liked money, so that's who they sold their books to.

02:14.520 --> 02:20.000
So this wasn't exactly a nefarious plot, but rather the blind prejudice of capitalism

02:20.000 --> 02:22.800
that gave us all these white guy characters.

02:22.800 --> 02:27.880
And the few times minorities were included, we'd get, ugh, things like this.

02:27.880 --> 02:32.880
While many characters were forgotten, thankfully, in some cases, a few persisted.

02:32.880 --> 02:37.400
As the US became more diverse, publishers sought ways to pursue that expanding demographic

02:37.400 --> 02:41.640
of non-white guys, and maybe the even more elusive demographic of women.

02:41.640 --> 02:46.320
To that end, an increasingly broad range of diverse characters were and are still being

02:46.320 --> 02:47.320
created.

02:47.320 --> 02:51.200
Of course, the earliest attempts were not always the most thoughtful.

02:51.200 --> 02:56.240
Luke Cage was the product of the Blaxploitation craze of the 70s, and Shang-Chi, a product

02:56.240 --> 02:58.480
of the Kung Fu movie craze.

02:58.480 --> 03:03.200
These characters are obviously cheap stereotypes, although they have grown over the years to

03:03.200 --> 03:05.700
be a bit more interesting and complex.

03:05.700 --> 03:10.240
In recent years, the two biggest superhero comic publishers, Marvel and DC Comics, have

03:10.240 --> 03:15.160
tried to escape racial stereotypes and present as wide a lineup of diverse characters as

03:15.160 --> 03:16.160
they possibly could.

03:16.680 --> 03:19.480
I'm going to talk briefly about Black Panther.

03:19.480 --> 03:24.360
I'm assuming you've probably seen it because I think everyone saw it.

03:24.360 --> 03:28.820
The opening scene of Black Panther tells you a lot about who this movie is intended for.

03:28.820 --> 03:32.440
It features Black children taking a break from their game of basketball to look up at

03:32.440 --> 03:34.200
something exciting happening.

03:34.200 --> 03:38.560
It's an image you could have seen in theaters around the world when Black Panther was screening.

03:38.560 --> 03:43.320
To me, it seemed like a very clear message that this is who the movie was for.

03:43.320 --> 03:47.280
Not just because it had a black superhero, like Blade or Spawn.

03:47.280 --> 03:52.000
This was a film with a writer, director, and cast that was predominantly black.

03:52.000 --> 03:57.560
Set in Africa, and ensconced in African culture, it meant a lot to people.

03:57.560 --> 04:00.360
I remember seeing this video after Black Panther came out.

04:08.360 --> 04:11.960
I've never left a movie and wanted to start a dance party, but that's how much it means

04:11.960 --> 04:16.000
to people to have a character who finally speaks to their experiences and culture.

04:16.000 --> 04:20.040
It's a chance to feel as though their stories are finally being told.

04:20.040 --> 04:24.400
Stories that weren't being told in superhero movies about white Americans.

04:24.400 --> 04:27.160
This is why representation matters.

04:27.160 --> 04:30.840
Comics have been reaching out to audiences in the same spirit, with new characters such

04:30.840 --> 04:36.680
as the New Muslim Miss Marvel, a half-black half-Hispanic Spider-Man, and a black Captain

04:36.680 --> 04:37.680
America.

04:37.680 --> 04:41.160
And if you're wondering why we're getting so many variations on the same characters,

04:41.160 --> 04:43.840
that's kind of been a thing in comics for decades.

04:43.840 --> 04:49.880
We've had four flashes, five robins, and more green lanterns than I can count.

04:49.880 --> 04:54.120
For what successes there have been, there have been far more failures.

04:54.120 --> 04:59.480
A sad fact of comics is that most people don't like new characters as much as the old ones.

04:59.480 --> 05:04.000
Things typically revert back to when the character was most popular, which is generally what

05:04.000 --> 05:05.720
they were like in their earliest stories.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.600
It's why Spider-Man is often depicted as a teenager.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.300
These are the tropes and eras that made them successful, and the ones that are most familiar

05:12.300 --> 05:16.520
and comfortable to readers, going back to a time when characters were typically white

05:16.520 --> 05:23.000
men.

05:23.000 --> 05:26.920
Criticism from the left about the state of comics isn't particularly new.

05:26.920 --> 05:31.800
Gail Simone, the eventual writer of comics including Secret Six and Birds of Prey, teamed

05:31.800 --> 05:36.240
with some of her feminist friends to create the website Women in Refrigerators back in

05:36.240 --> 05:37.880
1999.

05:37.880 --> 05:42.880
This references a rather infamous story where Green Lantern's girlfriend was murdered and

05:42.880 --> 05:44.880
stuffed into a refrigerator.

05:44.880 --> 05:49.760
In addition to that story, it chronicled the many ways in which female characters had been

05:49.760 --> 05:54.380
metaphorically stuffed into fridges to create some pathos for a male character.

05:54.380 --> 06:00.240
Most controversy that popped up tended to be storms and teacups, a lot of intense discussion

06:00.240 --> 06:03.960
and debate, though usually in a few months it would kind of go away.

06:03.960 --> 06:09.200
Like this one of a statue of Mary Jane where she's washing Spider-Man's costume, people

06:09.200 --> 06:14.240
thought that creating a statue where Spider-Man's girlfriend is washing his clothes in a thong

06:14.240 --> 06:17.880
and low-cut shirt might not be the most positive image for women.

06:17.880 --> 06:23.040
Then this whole thing called gamergate started, and suddenly people were very upset about

06:23.040 --> 06:30.360
depictions of women and minorities in video games, and this rhetoric was sadly quite transferable

06:30.360 --> 06:32.080
to the comics community.

06:32.080 --> 06:36.640
Then there was this variant cover of the first issue of Spider-Woman by Italian artist

06:36.640 --> 06:40.240
Milo Menara, revealed in August of 2014.

06:40.240 --> 06:45.160
The uproar around this was initially called Spider-Buttgate, it was the controversy of

06:45.160 --> 06:48.720
the moment when the term comicsgate came to life.

06:48.720 --> 06:54.200
As best as I can tell, the term comicsgate was originally used ironically, but very quickly

06:54.200 --> 06:58.560
it fell into favor with a group not too dissimilar from the gamergate crowd.

06:58.560 --> 07:02.520
While the movement was still some time from really taking off, it's here that the term

07:02.520 --> 07:14.520
first took root in the minds of a few people.

07:14.520 --> 07:18.840
The first high-profile harassment case often attributed to the comicsgate crowd targeted

07:18.840 --> 07:20.400
Chelsea Kane.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.120
Before entering comics, Kane distinguished herself writing a series of successful thriller

07:24.120 --> 07:27.840
novels with the first three all being New York Times bestsellers.

07:27.840 --> 07:32.700
In 2016 she was hired by Marvel to work on a new Mockingbird ongoing series, though critically

07:32.700 --> 07:38.080
well received, its sales were less than stellar, and it was cancelled with issue number eight.

07:38.080 --> 07:41.880
For that final issue though, Kane had the artist produce a cover where Mockingbird was

07:41.880 --> 07:46.320
wearing a t-shirt that read, ask me about my feminist agenda.

07:46.320 --> 07:51.520
The backlash to this cover was immediate, it got the full anti-SJW treatment, including

07:51.520 --> 07:55.680
a shout out in a Carl Benjamin video where he misreads the title.

07:55.680 --> 08:05.520
This is actually the cover of a Marvel magazine, Civil War II, Civil War II, Civil War II.

08:05.520 --> 08:09.720
Although the harassment surrounding Kane's tenure on Mockingbird eventually drove her

08:09.720 --> 08:15.140
away from social media entirely, reflecting back on it in 2018 she also highlights the

08:15.140 --> 08:18.800
positive experiences of fans coming to support her through that time.

08:18.800 --> 08:23.280
It even translated to a sales spike for the first volume of the Mockingbird ongoing series

08:23.280 --> 08:27.880
and two Eisner nominations for the title, including one for Kane as writer of the year.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.640
Kane didn't describe the Twitter mob after the eighth issue as driving her off Twitter

08:31.640 --> 08:36.680
though, rather it was the everyday harassment that really got to her and she experienced

08:36.680 --> 08:38.360
it constantly.

08:38.360 --> 08:44.360
The intense outroer after that number eight issue was just the most public symptom taken

08:44.360 --> 08:45.360
from her blog.

08:45.360 --> 08:51.040
I quit Twitter, I deactivated my account Thursday after receiving several misogynist and or

08:51.040 --> 08:53.520
jerky comments the night before.

08:53.520 --> 08:54.520
Several.

08:54.520 --> 08:55.520
Not dozens.

08:55.520 --> 08:57.000
Not a deluge.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
One is too many.

08:58.000 --> 09:02.420
I was tired of wasting energy dealing with the constant low-level misogyny and meanness

09:02.420 --> 09:05.400
that pollutes a certain kind of comic fandom.

09:05.400 --> 09:08.400
I posted some comments reflecting my frustration.

09:08.400 --> 09:14.400
The next morning, when I logged on to deactivate, I saw that I had lost approximately 1,500

09:14.400 --> 09:15.400
followers overnight.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.320
I also saw my notifications were filling up with new followers.

09:18.320 --> 09:20.520
I saw that comments were flooding my feed.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.360
I had no idea what was happening.

09:22.360 --> 09:26.520
I had never seen that kind of activity on my account, but I figured it wasn't good.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.080
I went through the deactivation.

09:28.080 --> 09:33.080
I assumed I had been trolled in some kind of organized sense, but I didn't know.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.080
Still don't.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.720
Frankly, I didn't care.

09:35.720 --> 09:36.720
It was moot.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.160
I was done.

09:39.160 --> 09:44.160
Kane didn't leave comics, though she would later say she felt as if comics had left her.

09:44.160 --> 09:48.080
She's currently working on a series called Man-Eaters for Image Comics.

09:48.080 --> 09:51.820
It's about girls turning into wildcats when they go through their period.

09:51.820 --> 09:54.840
She has yet to write again for Marvel Comics.

09:54.840 --> 09:58.800
Kane was the first high-profile target of a mob that would target women, typically working

09:58.800 --> 10:03.360
for Marvel Comics, which is perceived as being controlled by the SJWs.

10:03.360 --> 10:08.560
In July of 2017, Marvel editor Heather Antos posted a selfie of herself with a number of

10:08.560 --> 10:11.580
other women who worked at Marvel Comics getting a milkshake.

10:11.580 --> 10:16.240
It was a tribute to Flo Steinberg, the most prominent female face at Marvel Comics during

10:16.240 --> 10:19.360
its major boom period in the 1960s.

10:19.360 --> 10:23.720
Steinberg was officially one of the only two full-time employees at Marvel, with the artists

10:23.720 --> 10:28.680
largely working on a freelance basis and the only other full-timer being Stan Lee.

10:28.680 --> 10:34.180
This seemingly innocuous photo prompted outrage, typically from men unhappy with the recent

10:34.180 --> 10:38.600
direction of Marvel Comics, creating more titles featuring non-white male characters

10:38.600 --> 10:41.560
and hiring more non-white male creators.

10:41.580 --> 10:46.560
The outrage backfired pretty hard as the Make Mine Milkshake hashtag caught on, people rallied

10:46.560 --> 10:51.860
around many of these women, showing solidarity in the most American way imaginable, drinking

10:51.860 --> 10:54.420
a milkshake for women's rights.

10:54.420 --> 10:58.260
But momentum was building, and the movement would ferment from here.

10:58.260 --> 11:02.260
Although there is no central authority in the comicscape movement, we can get a vague

11:02.260 --> 11:07.060
idea of their grievances by looking at the most common criticisms and demands they make

11:07.060 --> 11:09.500
of what superhero comics should be.

11:09.500 --> 11:15.500
Summarized as best I can from the lists I looked up online, their demands are

11:15.500 --> 11:20.980
Less politics, specifically left-wing or progressive politics and stories.

11:20.980 --> 11:26.640
Not hiring writers and artists on the basis of their gender, sexuality, or ethnicity.

11:26.640 --> 11:30.500
Not replacing, embarrassing, or changing older heroes.

11:30.500 --> 11:35.500
To have their complaints be taken seriously and not brushed aside as bigotry.

11:35.500 --> 11:40.460
What's perhaps most noticeable in the language of comic skaters is that they don't consider

11:40.460 --> 11:46.860
themselves a subgroup of dissatisfied comics fans, but rather they are THE comics fans.

11:46.860 --> 11:50.520
They are at the core of what keeps this hobby churning along.

11:50.520 --> 11:55.260
The silent majority who are frustrated with having their concerns being swept aside for

11:55.260 --> 12:00.060
the sake of trying to attract an audience that does not represent actual comic fans

12:00.060 --> 12:03.740
and can't possibly love the medium as much as they do.

12:03.740 --> 12:08.760
It ties into the whole idea of a fake geek girl, a charge that was leveled specifically

12:08.760 --> 12:12.060
at Anthos and often other female creators.

12:12.060 --> 12:17.700
That a girl invading a space primarily dominated by men can't possibly be just as big a fan

12:17.700 --> 12:23.620
of the subculture, or if they were real fans, they wouldn't want to make any changes.

12:23.620 --> 12:28.220
It's not a coincidence that a space dominated by white men is threatened by the inclusion

12:28.220 --> 12:30.980
of anyone who doesn't fit that characteristic.

12:30.980 --> 12:35.540
You can see that in the implicit assumption of point number two that anyone hired to

12:35.540 --> 12:41.060
work in comics that isn't a white man is likely there because of some affirmative action

12:41.060 --> 12:43.460
program rather than their ability.

12:43.460 --> 12:47.620
I could go on about the many shitty white male writers and artists who have worked in

12:47.620 --> 12:51.820
comics without their identity being part of any criticism against them, but I really only

12:51.820 --> 12:56.020
highlight these claims from the comic skate crowd so we can understand what their complaints

12:56.020 --> 13:01.060
are, and as we'll see how that masks a bigotry that probably exists on a conscious

13:01.060 --> 13:03.340
or unconscious level.

13:03.340 --> 13:06.940
Before going on, I also want to acknowledge something important.

13:06.940 --> 13:11.700
None of this animosity is new, and that I've highlighted a negative reaction to white women

13:11.700 --> 13:17.100
doesn't mean it wasn't, and isn't also happening to men and women of color and LGBT

13:17.100 --> 13:18.140
creators.

13:18.140 --> 13:22.580
We live in a world where white women feminism tends to grab more attention than others,

13:22.580 --> 13:26.220
and while I won't pretend that white women don't face prejudice in their lives, it's

13:26.220 --> 13:31.580
a bit frustrating that the bigotry faced by other groups isn't as visibly opposed.

13:31.580 --> 13:35.500
After the milkshake moment, a few prominent voices began to appear within the comics game

13:35.500 --> 13:36.700
movement.

13:36.700 --> 13:41.380
The most vocal is almost certainly Richard Meyer, who creates YouTube videos under the

13:41.380 --> 13:48.660
channel name Comics and Diversity, rebranded in 2019 as Think About Comics.

13:48.660 --> 13:54.140
The channel is typically Meyer commenting on issues, both physical comics and actual

13:54.140 --> 13:59.660
news issues, relating to the comic industry, usually railing against characters, comics,

13:59.660 --> 14:03.980
and stories he feels are being pushed upon the fans by the SJWs.

14:03.980 --> 14:07.780
His videos often include him destroying comic books he doesn't like.

14:07.780 --> 14:12.780
His YouTube channel has grown quite a bit, and is currently sitting at nearly 94,000

14:12.780 --> 14:16.860
subscribers, and he's been featured on programs like the Jim Jefferies show.

14:17.500 --> 14:23.260
We of course are rockin' those A-cups, anything above a B-cup.

14:23.260 --> 14:24.980
You hate women.

14:24.980 --> 14:31.420
Ms. Marvel was introduced as a Pakistani-American Muslim, Riri Williams, who replaced Iron Man.

14:31.420 --> 14:36.220
If you don't like her, it's because you're racist or sexist, but probably both.

14:36.220 --> 14:38.500
It would upset a racist.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.260
I think it would.

14:40.260 --> 14:45.660
His commentary is perhaps most notable in that it absolutely refuses to understand subtext

14:45.660 --> 14:49.900
or see superhero comics as anything more than mindless entertainment.

14:49.900 --> 14:53.180
As dopey as he may sound, he does have a following.

14:53.180 --> 14:59.500
And in one video in particular, The Dark Roast, a private video since deleted, a darker side

14:59.500 --> 15:00.500
came out.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.020
Here are a few comments he made.

15:03.020 --> 15:08.060
I really didn't want to read this, so I asked for some help.

15:08.060 --> 15:15.260
Heather Antos is a cum dumpster who got a job at Marvel because Jordan White is a sad

15:15.260 --> 15:19.740
sack perv who jacked off to her, okay?

15:19.740 --> 15:23.060
The story is that she went and saw him at a convention.

15:23.060 --> 15:27.540
It's like, I'd like to be an editor, and he's like, oh, this is going to be a hard sell

15:27.540 --> 15:28.540
for HR.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.020
Like, Jordan White's going to go to Marvel HR.

15:31.020 --> 15:32.580
I really need you to hire her.

15:32.580 --> 15:36.380
My spank bank is getting incredibly low.

15:36.380 --> 15:37.380
What?

15:37.380 --> 15:40.340
What the fuck?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.820
Okay.

15:42.820 --> 15:50.020
Magdalene Visagio is a fucking crazy person, a criminal, who is definitely, definitely

15:50.020 --> 15:55.620
going to kill himself, and it's just where, when, and how.

15:55.620 --> 15:58.980
By the way, mags did not transition.

15:58.980 --> 15:59.980
Mags is a...

15:59.980 --> 16:03.700
I don't even want to say this.

16:03.700 --> 16:06.540
It's literally just a pervert.

16:06.540 --> 16:08.420
I can't read this.

16:08.420 --> 16:09.420
This, I...

16:09.420 --> 16:11.620
Yeah, this is so bad.

16:12.620 --> 16:17.900
Yeah, not going to read this next sentence.

16:17.900 --> 16:27.340
But they came along just at the right time that we're all, oh, no.

16:27.340 --> 16:32.380
But they came along just at the right time that we're all the trans issues, and they're

16:32.380 --> 16:37.140
like, oh, we can weaponize this.

16:37.140 --> 16:39.940
Fuck that comment, okay.

16:40.940 --> 16:43.500
So yeah, that's the kind of guy he is.

16:43.500 --> 16:48.060
He defended himself later on his YouTube channel, saying that these were all jokes, and shouldn't

16:48.060 --> 16:52.180
be held against him because he only said them once.

16:52.180 --> 17:00.300
I can't believe if you never heard the context that you're actually offended.

17:00.300 --> 17:04.140
I can't believe that, actually, no joke.

17:04.140 --> 17:09.900
But again, I've made 1,000 videos, 1,000 more.

17:09.900 --> 17:11.260
Is it a pattern behavior?

17:11.260 --> 17:13.460
Has it been repeated?

17:13.460 --> 17:16.500
Am I doing one like this right now?

17:16.500 --> 17:17.500
There was actually...

17:17.500 --> 17:19.940
The plan was actually to do several of them, but after it was done, I was like, pfft, I

17:19.940 --> 17:20.940
don't know what I'm doing.

17:20.940 --> 17:21.940
That was lame.

17:21.940 --> 17:22.940
It was lame.

17:22.940 --> 17:23.940
It was forced.

17:23.940 --> 17:25.420
I actually found it to be very boring.

17:25.420 --> 17:29.540
When I re-listened to it five months later, I was like, this is one of my worst videos

17:29.540 --> 17:30.540
ever.

17:30.540 --> 17:31.540
It's so boring.

17:31.540 --> 17:32.540
Right.

17:32.540 --> 17:35.740
I guess if you say it once, it doesn't count.

17:35.740 --> 17:39.140
He thinks he did a bad job in telling the jokes.

17:39.140 --> 17:44.500
He doesn't seem to be upset with their actual content or any of the claims within them.

17:44.500 --> 17:48.300
Meyer has also made videos alongside comic artist Ethan Van Scryver.

17:48.300 --> 17:52.700
Although many voices of ComicsGate are typically fans outside the industry, Van Scryver was

17:52.700 --> 17:56.760
an established artist, having worked for Marvel and DC Comics.

17:56.760 --> 18:01.480
Most notable for having done the artwork for the dreadful Green Lantern Rebirth and Flash

18:01.480 --> 18:03.900
Rebirth miniseries is...

18:03.900 --> 18:07.860
Van Scryver has been something of an asshole for years, and his association with Meyer

18:07.860 --> 18:10.380
seems to be continuing that trend.

18:10.380 --> 18:14.500
Meyer also had another run-in with an industry pro, writer Mark Wade.

18:14.500 --> 18:19.700
Wade has been especially prolific in his comics writing career, including a spectacular run

18:19.700 --> 18:25.620
on Fantastic Four with Mike Waringo, and a fantastic run on Daredevil with Chris Samney.

18:25.620 --> 18:30.100
In September of 2017, Mark Wade issued a statement on his Facebook.

18:30.100 --> 18:34.100
This statement is in regard to the Baltimore Comic Convention.

18:34.100 --> 18:38.620
There's a serial YouTube harasser named Richard C. Meyer who I'm told may be attending

18:38.620 --> 18:39.620
as a fan.

18:39.620 --> 18:44.340
If anyone sees this gentleman, or any of his friends, I need you to come find me and tell

18:44.340 --> 18:45.340
me immediately.

18:45.340 --> 18:49.540
Even if I'm on a panel, come up and interrupt.

18:49.540 --> 18:52.620
And this conversation eventually happened over the phone.

18:52.620 --> 18:55.700
Wade and Meyer chose to keep the discussion private.

18:55.700 --> 19:00.900
Instead, following the encounter, Wade had a follow-up post on his Facebook.

19:00.900 --> 19:05.100
The actual problem is that there are a large number of younger creators, professionals,

19:05.100 --> 19:09.460
staffers in this industry, a larger number than you could possibly imagine who do not

19:09.460 --> 19:11.500
have that same privilege.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.700
In this case, a platform.

19:13.700 --> 19:17.660
They are being harassed, repeatedly, and it's getting worse.

19:17.660 --> 19:21.220
As I say, I've been talking with many of them over the last few weeks.

19:21.220 --> 19:23.240
These are not histrionic people.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.340
These are not overly dramatic people.

19:25.340 --> 19:30.440
These are reasonable adults, some of whom cannot speak out because of their employers.

19:30.440 --> 19:34.080
And yet, they are legitimately frightened by harassers who threaten to come find them

19:34.080 --> 19:37.840
at conventions, at stores, at their homes.

19:37.840 --> 19:39.960
One was told she would be burned to death.

19:39.960 --> 19:42.440
Another was told she would be put down like a dog.

19:42.440 --> 19:45.800
And those are examples of some of the less hateful attacks.

19:45.800 --> 19:50.920
The Wade and Meyer conflict would grow over time and would eventually turn into a lawsuit.

19:50.920 --> 19:55.880
Meyer had crowdfunded a comics project called Jawbreakers and was to have it published by

19:55.880 --> 20:01.400
Antarctic Press when Wade shared some unflattering information about him and Antarctic Press

20:01.400 --> 20:03.900
was quick to cancel their agreement.

20:03.900 --> 20:08.360
But more importantly than the two white guys snapping at each other are the marginalized

20:08.360 --> 20:13.440
voices who don't have the privilege of this large platform to air some of their grievances

20:13.440 --> 20:16.440
as highlighted by Wade in his Facebook post.

20:16.440 --> 20:20.840
This harassment is something fomented by the comicsgate crowd, going insofar as to make

20:20.840 --> 20:24.960
blacklists and targeting comic shops that disagreed with their mission.

20:24.960 --> 20:29.360
Before Antarctic Press ended their relationship with Meyer, a number of comic shops publicly

20:29.360 --> 20:31.600
stated that they would not carry his title.

20:31.600 --> 20:36.040
In response, he asked his sizable audience to find out where these stores were and create

20:36.040 --> 20:37.040
a list.

20:37.040 --> 20:42.200
At least one of these stores was the target of vandalism, variant edition comics in Edmonton,

20:42.200 --> 20:43.200
Alberta.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.240
We push positivity, we push inclusion, we push diversity.

20:47.240 --> 20:51.320
That's why she decided to take a public stance on an issue that's dividing the comic book

20:51.320 --> 20:56.320
world, electing not to stock an upcoming book by an author known for opposing what

20:56.320 --> 20:59.280
he calls forced diversity in comics.

20:59.280 --> 21:04.040
I don't know what he wants, but I feel like he just, if he wants anything, it's destruction

21:04.040 --> 21:05.040
and regression.

21:05.040 --> 21:08.980
The store's tweet blew up with responses from supporters and critics.

21:08.980 --> 21:13.560
The author, Richard Meyer, even made a video response on his YouTube channel.

21:13.560 --> 21:16.080
Variant edition in Edmonton, Canada.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.720
They're doing multiple steps of an intimidation and blogging campaign.

21:19.720 --> 21:23.320
I see it as a statement of, as we can get to you.

21:23.320 --> 21:29.240
LeBlanc has nothing to go on but a gut feeling, but she's sure the crime isn't a coincidence.

21:29.240 --> 21:35.840
For this to be a random attack at the same time as we're being press online, what else

21:35.840 --> 21:36.920
could it be?

21:36.920 --> 21:40.600
Another well-publicized incident occurred in late August of 2018.

21:40.600 --> 21:47.580
Marcia, widow of beloved and extremely talented comic artist Darwin Cook, was targeted on

21:47.580 --> 21:52.060
social media after she made a tweet about how her late husband would have absolutely

21:52.060 --> 21:55.820
opposed the opinions and actions of the Comics Gate crowd.

21:55.820 --> 21:59.660
The backlash against her was as predictable as it was depressing.

21:59.660 --> 22:04.940
She had an exchange with Ethan Van Scryver that is well worth reading in its entirety.

22:04.940 --> 22:10.660
Marcia is responding to a video in which comics artist Billy Tucci mistakenly says that Darwin

22:10.660 --> 22:13.180
Cook would be a supporter of Comics Gate.

22:13.180 --> 22:15.180
Hi guys, I'm right here.

22:15.180 --> 22:18.100
And Ethan, it looks like your friends are being transphobic.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.580
I'm sure you wouldn't support anything like that, would you?

22:20.580 --> 22:24.060
You certainly would ask your friends to stop bringing my name up, right?

22:24.060 --> 22:25.940
Because I haven't seen that yet.

22:25.940 --> 22:29.500
I've been pretty happy to mute people who are harassing me on Twitter, Martha.

22:29.500 --> 22:30.700
Or block them.

22:30.700 --> 22:35.020
People who use my name spitefully, who lie about me, and torment me and my family over

22:35.020 --> 22:36.820
political differences.

22:36.820 --> 22:39.100
It goes a long way towards peace of mind.

22:39.100 --> 22:40.700
Just mute them.

22:40.700 --> 22:45.020
I find what goes a long way is for the ringleader to use his dog whistle to call his baby's

22:45.020 --> 22:46.020
home.

22:46.020 --> 22:49.940
But sure, these children are whipped up by you and it's pathetic you can't say leave

22:49.940 --> 22:51.340
her alone to them.

22:51.340 --> 22:53.460
Cowards, all of you.

22:53.460 --> 22:56.420
What do you really think Darwin could do right now, Ethan?

22:56.420 --> 22:59.660
Tell the widow to use mute or stand up to a bunch of idiots?

22:59.660 --> 23:02.100
I know the answer.

23:02.100 --> 23:06.060
The comics industry has become incredibly cruel, Marcia, and I don't wish you to endure

23:06.060 --> 23:08.300
the abuse that I have over the past few months.

23:08.300 --> 23:12.820
But I've learned quite a bit about how the internet works and how mobs are manipulated

23:12.820 --> 23:16.460
and weaponized into endless conflict, and this isn't okay.

23:16.460 --> 23:20.860
Ethan, I know you have felt isolated from the general industry, but you need to know

23:20.860 --> 23:25.900
it is because most people feel you are stoking a dangerous group of fans that hate women,

23:25.900 --> 23:28.140
people of color, and all the gay community.

23:28.140 --> 23:32.540
That's not okay, and Darwin will not be associated with it.

23:32.540 --> 23:38.020
They're wrong, and Darwin was also an individualist who trusted his own instincts, even when the

23:38.020 --> 23:40.420
crowd wanted other things for him.

23:40.780 --> 23:43.860
I'm never going to watch this or any other comicscape video.

23:43.860 --> 23:44.860
Sorry.

23:44.860 --> 23:48.500
I have no interest in your group and wish you personally the best in life.

23:48.500 --> 23:51.860
I hope you snap out of this cult hypnosis at some point.

23:51.860 --> 23:54.140
Well, I'll settle for that.

23:54.140 --> 23:58.780
I miss you and this broke my heart, and I want you to know I think about you both often.

23:58.780 --> 24:01.380
Please know you are loved.

24:01.380 --> 24:05.980
Just so you know, your fans are all up on me about this and calling me trash, garbage,

24:05.980 --> 24:09.940
and a liar, so any time you'd like to tell them to back off is great.

24:09.940 --> 24:12.940
Darwin agreed with you on nothing and you know this.

24:12.940 --> 24:15.340
James, I'm blocking this dude.

24:15.340 --> 24:17.620
Tell him to apologize to Nassar.

24:17.620 --> 24:20.300
Are you going to tell anyone to apologize to me?

24:20.300 --> 24:25.780
Yes, SJW's in comics apologized to Marcia Cook for cynically using her as a shield to

24:25.780 --> 24:28.940
attack comicsgate and for lying to her.

24:28.940 --> 24:33.300
It was Darwin's dear friend Billy who claimed him for comicsgate, and I am disgusted by

24:33.300 --> 24:34.860
this whole affair.

24:34.860 --> 24:37.500
This wasn't fair to you or Darwin, Marcia.

24:38.020 --> 24:40.380
Yeah, don't throw Billy under the bus here.

24:40.380 --> 24:44.100
Billy doesn't know what your group does and was kind enough to give you five seconds of

24:44.100 --> 24:45.100
his time.

24:45.100 --> 24:49.140
Billy's friends are quote tweeting him and saying, Darr offered himself.

24:49.140 --> 24:50.140
Yours are.

24:50.140 --> 24:53.540
Billy may be a conservative, but he's nothing like you.

24:53.540 --> 24:56.700
And this is Billy Tucci, another artist who chimes in.

24:56.700 --> 25:01.860
I apologize for any misconception that I claimed my dear friend Darr for any cause.

25:01.860 --> 25:05.200
Twitter is a vicious home for those who'd never confront you in person.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.960
You all know where I stand with friends both left and right.

25:07.960 --> 25:11.280
Hopefully soon we'll all stand in the arena of civility.

25:11.280 --> 25:17.740
It was not a good moment for Van Scryver, particularly when he asked the SJWs to apologize

25:17.740 --> 25:23.680
after Marcia was quite clear it was his fanbase that was harassing her.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.940
A number of prominent industry pros came to Martha's defense, and a mantra penned by

25:27.940 --> 25:33.240
writer Tom Taylor on Twitter a few days later was soon reposted by a number of other comics

25:33.240 --> 25:34.240
professionals.

25:34.280 --> 25:39.480
This was the first major anti-comicsgate display from professionals in the industry.

25:39.480 --> 25:44.480
But again, and I feel as though I can't hit this note enough, this was a comicsgate attack

25:44.480 --> 25:48.800
that got attention after it hit these creators close to home.

25:48.800 --> 25:52.760
In this case, Martha herself can make the point better than I can.

25:52.760 --> 25:56.800
Hopefully this is my last comment on the subject, but I agree with everyone saying it is annoying

25:56.800 --> 26:01.040
that people didn't get on board the reality of what these idiots are doing until it was

26:01.040 --> 26:03.560
a white wife attacked.

26:03.560 --> 26:07.920
I don't think as many people would care WTF happened here, except that they were thinking

26:07.920 --> 26:10.180
of me as an extension of a man.

26:10.180 --> 26:11.540
So take that how you will.

26:17.540 --> 26:22.760
While researching this video, I came across an interesting article from 2014 on ICV2 by

26:22.760 --> 26:28.460
Rob Selkowitz titled, If comicsgate ever happens, it will be catastrophic.

26:28.460 --> 26:33.940
It was responding to an article about gamergate by Ezra Klein, discussing how the politicization

26:33.940 --> 26:37.140
of everything is bleeding into our hobbies.

26:37.140 --> 26:42.540
In his article, Selkowitz highlights the dangers of longtime fans becoming self-appointed gatekeepers

26:42.540 --> 26:46.620
to a hobby, denying entry of diverse newcomers into their space.

26:46.620 --> 26:51.020
The danger perceived to them is the undermining of their authority in this space.

26:51.020 --> 26:56.020
They call themselves the real or true fans of something, and anyone not adhering to this

26:56.020 --> 27:00.820
vision is an outsider trying to destroy something closely tied to their identity.

27:00.820 --> 27:04.700
Selkowitz goes on to point out how this sentiment has existed for a while.

27:04.700 --> 27:08.140
Comicsgate could do the same, leaving a lasting harm to comics.

27:08.140 --> 27:12.700
It's an interesting article and quite perceptive, though to me this fear of politicizing comics

27:12.700 --> 27:18.020
is not a problem for the medium itself, but rather the relationship fans have with it.

27:18.020 --> 27:21.580
Politics have long been a part of comics, and broadening the representation of different

27:21.580 --> 27:26.740
people into comics will only increase that, at least if it happens in a society that functions

27:26.740 --> 27:28.260
like ours does.

27:28.260 --> 27:31.380
Here are two examples of political stories.

27:31.380 --> 27:35.820
The character Northstar of the X-Men, one of the first openly gay characters in superhero

27:35.820 --> 27:38.300
comics, was married in 2012.

27:38.300 --> 27:41.580
It was the first ever gay wedding in superhero comics.

27:41.580 --> 27:47.960
Conversely in 2013, DC Comics refused the Batwoman creative team to let their lead character

27:47.960 --> 27:51.420
marry her female partner, Maggie Sawyer.

27:51.420 --> 27:56.300
J.H. Williams III and W. Holden Blackman, in response, announced that they would be

27:56.300 --> 27:59.540
leaving as the editorial team on Batwoman.

27:59.540 --> 28:04.020
Although these would have simply been weddings in these characters' lives, the editorial

28:04.020 --> 28:08.020
decision, one way or another, could easily be considered political.

28:08.020 --> 28:12.320
One decision favored left-wing politics, the other right-wing politics.

28:12.320 --> 28:17.020
When a character's wedding is considered inherently political because of their sexual

28:17.020 --> 28:22.400
orientation, this doesn't say we're politicizing comics, but rather we live in a time when

28:22.400 --> 28:28.000
gay marriage, and by extension someone's sexuality, is a political question.

28:28.000 --> 28:32.180
The pattern holds true for many other types of minority representation, where characters

28:32.180 --> 28:36.780
of color are expected to not comment on race issues, and female characters are expected

28:36.780 --> 28:42.220
to stay silent about feminism, and especially not wear a t-shirt about it.

28:42.220 --> 28:46.420
Wanting representation in comic books doesn't have to be an inherently political thing.

28:46.420 --> 28:50.860
It can be as simple as some kids wanting to see a superhero who looks just like them.

28:50.860 --> 28:54.860
It's only political when someone says it shouldn't be happening.

28:54.860 --> 28:59.520
Ironically, their shallow understanding of comics should make the comicsgate crowd more

28:59.520 --> 29:02.660
understanding of where these young readers are coming from.

29:02.660 --> 29:08.080
The fact that some grown white men can't manage to read comics featuring non-white male characters

29:08.080 --> 29:10.420
says so much more.

29:10.420 --> 29:15.740
And if the idea of superheroes being used as a lens for slightly older readers to examine

29:15.740 --> 29:21.180
modern-day issues from a different perspective, I'm not sure why that's inherently a bad

29:21.180 --> 29:22.180
thing.

29:22.180 --> 29:26.940
Obviously, it could be bad when it's done poorly, but again, I go back to a point I

29:26.940 --> 29:28.620
made earlier in this video.

29:28.620 --> 29:33.340
Why focus on the diversity and not, say, bad writing or bad art?

29:33.340 --> 29:36.900
Perhaps they should be asking themselves some serious questions about diversity itself,

29:36.900 --> 29:42.340
and why is it they get annoyed or angry whenever it's mentioned in a storyline?

29:42.420 --> 29:47.300
The comicsgate crowd's problem isn't just its embarrassingly shallow reading of comics.

29:47.300 --> 29:51.060
It's the hostility that foments the outright harassment of creators who are members of

29:51.060 --> 29:54.860
the LGBT community, people of color, and women.

29:54.860 --> 29:59.180
This is a line that is frequently crossed, often hidden from sight, that becomes part

29:59.180 --> 30:04.020
of the daily churn of artists trying to express themselves in a medium that has been historically

30:04.020 --> 30:06.340
dominated by white men.

30:06.340 --> 30:09.100
It's not that white men have to be shitty to them.

30:09.100 --> 30:13.700
It's that a portion of them are, and they refuse to behave like adults.

30:13.700 --> 30:17.580
On the bright side, recent news on comicsgate is that it's over.

30:17.580 --> 30:22.100
Meyer is declaring mission accomplished, and the industry has supposedly been saved from

30:22.100 --> 30:25.580
being taken over by the SJWs.

30:25.580 --> 30:27.500
Is comicsgate successful or unsuccessful?

30:27.500 --> 30:28.500
I don't know.

30:28.500 --> 30:31.420
Is customer service better or worse?

30:31.420 --> 30:33.860
Are the comics better or worse than they were a year ago?

30:33.860 --> 30:39.500
It seems to me the comics are better, and I'm sure there are multiple factors, but

30:39.500 --> 30:49.580
I would say it is partly successful to the beliefs of people who liked comicsgate.

30:49.580 --> 30:52.620
Whether comicsgate needs to go on, I don't think so.

30:52.620 --> 30:58.420
The claims of victory and departure ring hollow to me, but it does signal that this unifying

30:58.420 --> 31:01.380
hashtag is falling out of fashion.

31:01.380 --> 31:04.940
In a way, this video could almost be considered a post-mortem.

31:04.940 --> 31:09.500
But I hope if there's one thing people take away from this, is that while this childish

31:09.500 --> 31:15.980
abusive behavior can be focused around a hashtag, even after that hashtag goes away, the problem

31:15.980 --> 31:18.660
still exists.

31:18.660 --> 31:22.860
Before leaving though, I want to leave us all with a few words from comics legend Stan Lee.

31:22.860 --> 31:27.260
Although he has a checkered past, specifically in how he treated some of the artists he worked

31:27.260 --> 31:32.220
with in Marvel's early days, he did leave us with a lovely short message before he passed

31:32.220 --> 31:35.620
away on his thoughts about diversity in the comics industry.

31:35.620 --> 31:37.500
Hi, heroes.

31:37.500 --> 31:39.500
This is Stan Lee coming at you.

31:39.500 --> 31:46.580
I just want you to know, Marvel has always been and always will be a reflection of the

31:46.580 --> 31:49.780
world right outside our window.

31:49.780 --> 31:55.500
That world may change and evolve, but the one thing that will never change is the way

31:55.500 --> 31:59.340
we tell our stories of heroism.

31:59.340 --> 32:06.700
Those stories have room for everyone, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or color

32:06.700 --> 32:08.420
of their skin.

32:08.420 --> 32:16.140
The only things we don't have room for are hatred, intolerance, and bigotry.

32:16.140 --> 32:19.140
That man next to you, he's your brother.

32:19.140 --> 32:22.420
That woman over there, she's your sister.

32:22.420 --> 32:25.820
And that kid walking by, hey, who knows?

32:25.820 --> 32:30.020
He may have the proportionate strength of a spider.

32:30.020 --> 32:37.220
We're all part of one big family, the human family, and we all come together in the body

32:37.220 --> 32:39.060
of Marvel.

32:39.060 --> 32:41.980
And you, you're part of that family.

32:41.980 --> 32:49.500
You're part of the Marvel universe that moves ever upward and onward to greater glory.

32:49.500 --> 32:53.900
In other words, Excelsior.

32:53.900 --> 32:57.260
A big thanks to Mexie for helping me out.

32:57.260 --> 33:00.620
I'm so sorry I asked you to read something so terrible.
