0	2780	What makes a classic TV show?
2780	7540	Some shows take the world by storm, becoming fan favorites remembered for generations.
7540	11900	Others are slow starters, growing a following before reaching that tipping point of becoming
11900	14760	a fixture on TV screens around the world.
14760	20180	And some never reached those heights, achieving cult status among a select group of influential
20180	21180	people.
21180	25580	Arrested Development has a unique distinction of not only achieving that cult status, but
25580	30280	parlaying that into a divisive return, only to have that change how people remember a
30280	33600	series that was being called a future classic.
33600	38080	The story of Arrested Development, a show about a family that fell apart, held together
38080	43720	by one man, will be put together by this one man, trying to understand how we decide what
43720	46280	makes a TV show a classic.
46280	50880	In the early 2000s, reality television was on the ascent, and that got director and former
50880	55320	TV star Ron Howard thinking of new ways of doing television.
55320	59460	Something that used this reality TV grammar to tell scripted comedies with more depth
59460	62180	and layers, while also cutting back on costs.
62180	68060	A different kind of situation comedy that would be packed with more jokes, you know,
68060	73660	more funny situations, and a less traditional feel than what you get with a normal kind
73660	75180	of half hour sitcom.
75180	79460	Through the production company he started with Brian Grazer, Imagine Entertainment, Howard
79460	84300	approached a number of producers with this concept, and it was Mitchell Hurwitz who connected
84300	86080	most with the idea.
86080	92620	But I wanted to use that savings in expense and time to shoot a lot of scenes and to try
92620	101320	to get at family enmeshment and to try to get at character that went beyond stock character.
101320	105220	Hurwitz was particularly attracted to the idea of creating characters with greater depth
105220	107240	than in your typical sitcom.
107240	111260	Hurwitz had been a veteran of many sitcoms including The Golden Girls, The Golden Palace,
111260	115000	The John Larraket Show, The Ellen Show, and several other programs that didn't start
115000	121420	with V. One small project of note was a 1999 series called Everything's Relative which
121420	122940	aired on NBC.
122940	126940	Notable not just for starring Jeffrey Tambor, who would be part of the cast of Arrested
126940	131100	Development, but also for acting as a half step between the sitcoms of the past that
131100	135220	Hurwitz had started his career working in and what sitcoms of the future would eventually
135220	136220	look like.
136220	139980	It's a strange combination of the single camera style with an awkward laugh track thrown
139980	146060	in and the plot of a comedy writer forced to make his dysfunctional family work would
146060	155260	very much echo what would eventually become Arrested Development.
155260	159420	Although six episodes were produced, it only ran for four before it was cancelled.
159420	164460	But it was this project that would help inform the pitch Hurwitz took to Imagine Entertainment.
164460	169060	Hurwitz's original idea for Arrested Development was a dysfunctional family going from riches
169060	173020	to rags, though many of the particulars went through a number of changes before it all
173020	187060	came together.
187060	189820	Other aspects of the show came from Hurwitz's own life.
189820	194340	Having grown up in California, the famous Bluth banana stand was based on a chocolate
194340	199060	chip business he started at twelve called The Chipyard, and the street that stand began
199060	203580	on, Balboa Boulevard, would be the name of the apartment complex that Lucille Booth would
203580	204700	call home.
204700	209900	The character of Maybee was even named after Hurwitz's two daughters, May and Phoebe.
209900	214000	Outside of his own life, Hurwitz was also inspired by the Enron scandal that saw a massive energy
214000	217460	company crumble when it committed an elaborate accounting fraud scheme.
217460	221060	The Blue Family at the center of the series would similarly be watching their own business
221060	222980	crumble all around them.
222980	225460	Arrested Development was always supposed to be different.
225460	228900	Instead of a finely polished product, rehearsed throughout the week, and then recorded on
228900	232460	a soundstage, it would be filmed on location with little rehearsal.
232460	236420	Scenes were written and rewritten on the fly, and the look of the show mimicked a documentary,
236420	240900	one shot with two cameras, often moving through scenes scrambling to get reactions.
240900	245660	Jason Bateman was cast as Michael Bluth, the one son holding the Bluth family together.
245660	249260	Bateman's first on-screen acting job was at the age of twelve on Little House on the
249260	250260	Prairie.
250260	253140	He wanted to appear in Silver Spoons and It's Your Move.
253140	257900	Throughout the 90s, he had a series of failed TV pilots, creating some reluctance to cast
257900	258900	him as Michael.
258900	262860	But when he auditioned, they found he was the perfect fit for the relatively level-headed
262860	267360	member of the Bluth family, the man who wants nothing more than to leave that family, only
267360	269940	to be constantly dragged back into their drama.
269940	274620	They are going to keep Dad in prison, at least until this gets all sorted out.
274620	277900	Also, the attorney said that they're going to have to put a halt in the company's expense
277900	278900	account.
278900	283060	Interesting, I would have expected that after they're keeping Dad in jail.
283060	286660	Portia de Rossi was cast as Lindsay Bluth, Michael's twin sister.
286660	291780	De Rossi had made her debut in the 1994 movie, Sirens, and before Arrested Development, she
291780	293740	was a regular on Ally McBeal.
293740	298180	As Lindsay, she was the socialite who spent more time creating the illusion of being a
298180	301900	philanthropist than actually doing anything aside from shopping.
301900	304500	I'm kind of the charitable one of the family.
304500	306300	I think it's best if you got a job.
306300	309660	Oh come on, I'm a parent, I care about my daughter every bit as much as Michael cares
309660	310660	about his son.
310660	313340	What grade am I in?
313340	314340	What kind of job?
314340	319620	Will Arnett played the eldest of the Bluth siblings, George Oscar Bluth Jr. or Job.
319620	323900	Job was one of the tougher roles to be cast, with none of the actors auditioning, managing
323900	326020	to find a suitable voice for the character.
326020	331460	Arnett, who only had a few credits to his name, most notably two episodes on The Sopranos,
331460	336260	managed to breathe life into the impossibly arrogant and intensely vulnerable Job.
336260	338260	And Job is quite the magician.
338260	340260	This is the magic trick, huh?
340260	341260	Illusion, Michael.
341260	343860	Mmm, trick is something a whore does for money.
343860	347140	Michael Cera was cast as Michael's son, George Michael.
347140	351860	Only 15 by the time Arrested Development premiered, he had already appeared in several movies
351860	353340	and TV shows.
353340	357140	George Michael is the timid, well-meaning teen who is struggling to grow up with a
357140	359420	father who doesn't quite get him.
359420	363460	George Michael is also nursing a confusing attraction to his cousin.
363460	366940	I'm tempted to kiss again so we can teach him a lesson.
366940	367940	Why would that teach them a lesson?
367940	370140	No, I mean, to freak them out.
370140	372980	Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense.
372980	374980	Well, isn't that what makes it funny?
374980	375980	I'm laughing.
375980	379140	Let's go fish, you know.
379140	383580	Alia Shawkat was cast as maybe Funke, Lindsay's daughter.
383580	387260	Even though she was only 14 when the show debuted, she'd already come off a nearly
387260	390520	40-episode run on the series State of Grace.
390520	395440	She is bolder than her cousin, seeming to lack much empathy as her antics fail to catch
395440	408880	the attention of her absent-minded parents.
408880	414280	Tony Hill was cast as the youngest Bluth sibling, Byron Bluth, better known as Buster.
414280	419040	Relatively unknown at the time, Hill had guest spots on a few programs, but Arrested Development
419040	421040	would be his first major role.
421040	425400	Buster is an extremely awkward mother boy who spends much of the series in a state
425400	428680	of perpetual confusion.
428680	447560	David Cross played Tobias Funke, Lindsay's husband and maybe his father, although creator
447560	452800	Mitch Hurwitz claims to have offered the well-traveled stand-up Cross any role he wanted,
452800	456800	Cross said it was the roles of Job and Buster that were suggested to him.
456800	460280	Regardless, it was Tobias that spoke to Cross as a character.
460280	463440	After a beef struggle with the network to make sure Tobias would have what would be
463440	467840	his signature mustache, Cross slipped into the role of a former therapist turned actor
467840	476560	who had a very unusual way of choosing his words.
476560	480720	Jeffrey Tambor was originally asked to only play the role of family patriarch George
480720	485520	Oscar Bluth Sr. for a single episode, but the role was such a good fit for Tambor that
485520	488960	he jumped at the chance to become part of the principal cast.
488960	493720	A veteran and beloved from his time as Hank Kingsley on The Larry Sanders Show, Tambor
493720	498520	created a George Sr. that was both domineering and slimy, all from the comfort of his prison
498520	508600	cell.
508600	513800	Jessica Walter made up the final member of the principal cast as Lucille Bluth, the sharp-tongued
513800	516040	matriarch of the Bluth family.
516040	520400	Having been acting for over 40 years, Walter was the most experienced of the cast, notably
520400	524440	appearing in Clint Eastwood's directorial debut, Play Misty for Me.
524440	528320	Lucille Bluth is a woman so wealthy and out of touch with the common man that she has
528320	539600	trouble acclimating to her family's new financial reality.
539600	543640	Although technically not a member of the cast, Arrested Development did have a regular narrator
543640	545840	voiced by Ron Howard.
545840	549160	Originally Howard was only a placeholder, but his performance as a detached narrator
549160	553320	was so effective and was very charming to the network, he became a permanent fixture
553440	554440	for the series.
554440	559840	I actually borrowed from National Geographic.
559840	568440	I thought it should be approached with a kind of a sociological or anthropological mindset.
568440	577200	I think this is the same narrator who would be doing something about the indigenous inhabitants
577200	581000	of the Amazon basin, and then their next job would be to come and talk about the Bluth
581000	591520	family.
591520	596480	Arrested Development had a very rich world of recurring characters, and it would be nearly
596480	598600	impossible to list all of them here.
598600	602720	But the ones who appeared most frequently were the family's lawyer Barry Zuckercorn,
602720	607240	played by Henry Winkler, news anchor John Beard, a local Los Angeles news anchor who
607240	611680	was portraying a fictionalized version of himself, Liza Minnelli as Lucille Bluth's
611680	617240	rival, Lucille Austero, also known as Lucille II, Mae Whitman, played George Michael's
617240	622960	season 2 love interest Ann Veal, and Justin Grant Wade, appeared as high school jock,
622960	623960	Steve Holt.
623960	637920	There was also this mysterious janitor, played by Martin Moll.
637920	644640	He always gets me to Gene Parmesan, how could I forget him?
644640	650480	Debuting on November 2nd, 2003, in an episode titled, Pilot, we meet the Bluth family just
650480	660760	as it seems as though it's ready to fall apart.
660760	665160	The cast is introduced through some narration and a few key interactions, and we find out
665160	669720	that this episode is about Michael being snubbed for a partnership at his family's business
669720	679200	shortly before George Sr. is arrested.
679200	682300	The family looks to Michael to run the business.
682300	704560	Even though he wants to leave for the sake of his son, he stays behind.
704560	709060	Of course George Michael might also be motivated by the new crush he has on his cousin, Mae
709060	720100	B.
720100	723740	This along with many character dynamics would be explored throughout the season.
723740	728680	Unlike other sitcoms that tended to keep a fixed premise and placed it in novel situations
728680	733540	in each episode, Arrested Development would introduce dynamics that would run and change
733540	736080	as we followed the adventures of the Bluths.
736080	739500	Perhaps this would mean dynamics that ran through the entire series, sometimes only
739500	742360	for a season or even just a few episodes.
742360	746040	George Michael's crush on his cousin went the distance, sometimes becoming the focus
746040	750040	of his character and other times just humming along in the background, but it was always
750040	753880	safe to assume that, no matter where you are in the series, George Michael is harboring
753880	767120	some feelings for Mae B.
767120	771300	The pilot was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, and you may be more familiar with their
771300	773680	work on the highest grossing movie of all time.
773680	777600	They were a major part of establishing the look of Arrested Development, using a cinema
777600	782260	verite style to create the impression of a documentary crew in the thick of it.
782260	786860	If the series looks like it was Mae cheaply, that was by design, as multi-camera sitcoms
786860	790140	at the time were becoming increasingly expensive to produce.
790140	794060	The quick cuts and rushed production meant that footage sometimes lacked the polish to
794060	797900	tell a coherent story, which is part of the reason a narrator was used to fill in the
797900	798900	gaps.
798900	817460	This was a necessity, with shows often having
817460	821780	thirty minutes of footage needing to be cut down to twenty-two minutes for broadcast.
821780	825580	It was often suggested that this might be attributed to the actor's improving, and
825580	829500	while this was the original intention of the series, the writing was so strong that
829500	832140	very little of that happened as the series progressed.
832140	835820	Alternate takes often came from writers coming up with new jokes on the spot.
835820	839540	New jokes and missing plot points were also recorded after the fact.
839540	854540	Later inserted into scenes, while a speaking character's back is turned to the camera.
854540	858340	In addition to the structure and style of the series, the pilot also establishes some
858340	862020	important ways it would differentiate itself from other sitcoms.
862020	865980	Families that don't get along weren't an entirely novel concept at this point, even
865980	868500	if the opposite were still more common.
868500	872740	But arrested development added some subjects to the idea by placing Michael and his son
872740	877940	in a literal fake home, a model home created by the Bluth Company to sell their new development
877940	879900	project, Sudden Valley.
879900	883900	One of the big charms of the series was its ability to take seemingly meaningless jokes,
883900	888620	references, and build on them several episodes or several seasons later.
888620	893100	Sometimes it was just a running gag, but sometimes it also meant expanding on a moment to create
893100	894540	an entire plotline.
894540	899820	An example from the pilot is Michael interviewing for a new job at Sitwell Housing.
899820	904380	What was originally just a placeholder company was later revealed to be a major rival to
904380	908620	the Bluth Company, led by Stan Sitwell, played by Ed Begley Jr.
908620	916340	Themetically, the show also had some interesting
916340	921100	things to say about how the upper class are often just as silly as the rest of us and
921100	925340	got to where they were by being willing to step over others and each other.
925340	928380	And there's the very interesting fusion between family and business throughout the
928380	932700	series, connecting love and commerce with disastrous consequences.
932700	936540	When George Sr. tells Michael that he didn't promote him to protect him, we find out it
936540	938780	wasn't purely out of concern for his son.
962700	967100	And as we'll see throughout the series, the Bluths are never beneath screwing one
967100	971740	another over for financial gain, or in some cases, to protect the company.
971740	976300	The pilot episode for Arrested Development did so much heavy lifting I can't possibly
976300	980460	cover it all here, and the rest of the series is similarly dense.
980460	984340	As we'll see as we move forward, this was often weighed more to its complexity rather
984340	988820	than its depth, and it was the show's complexity that played a role in it becoming a revered
988820	992300	classic that struggled to find a wider audience.
992300	996140	One of the central dynamics of the series, especially in its first season, is the struggle
996140	999080	between the Bluth siblings and their parents.
999080	1003140	One of the ways it manifests itself is in the rivalry between Job and Michael.
1003140	1007380	Job and Michael butt heads in the early episode over Job's girlfriend, Marta, played by
1007380	1011860	Leonor Varela, and then later by Patricia Velasquez when scheduling conflicts arose
1011860	1013020	for the first actress.
1013020	1016220	Job's attitude towards his girlfriend is less than attractive.
1016220	1030260	On the other hand, Michael is completely smitten with Marta, and he's conflicted
1030260	1045340	over the fact that he wants to date his brother's girlfriend.
1045340	1049860	As Marta develops feelings for Michael, she's overheard expressing them to her mother by
1049860	1054660	Job.
1054660	1065340	Spanish speakers are probably head of the joke on this one.
1065340	1068540	Job and Michael come to blows in the following episode.
1068540	1082020	Finally Marta becomes a real character, realizing the Bluths are awful.
1082020	1085820	This rejection brings the two together, until we see them at each other's throats over
1085820	1100140	who gets to run the company.
1100140	1103420	Throughout this stretch of episodes in the first half of season one, there's very little
1103420	1107580	that Marta does except play the dutiful and eventually conflicted girlfriend.
1107580	1112180	It's hard to understand what she ever saw in Job, and that a few gestures from Michael
1112180	1117180	sweep her off her feet make her seem as though this is a woman, who is a successful actress
1117180	1121620	by the way, who has had some underwhelming experiences with romance.
1121620	1125260	What it also reveals is that she's more of a prop being passed around so we can learn
1125260	1127980	more about the relationship between Michael and Job.
1127980	1132340	That this eventually gets replaced by who gets to be in charge of the company reveals
1132340	1136940	that their rivalry is a product of their own bitter feelings towards one another, and also
1136940	1139860	how inconsequential Marta was as a character.
1139860	1144380	The joke about confusing the word hermano for a name also reveals just how horribly
1144380	1146260	self-absorbed these characters are.
1146260	1150700	It's a word that should come very easily to anyone with a Spanish-speaking girlfriend.
1150700	1156860	But Job is completely oblivious, and Michael, for as charmed as he supposedly is by Marta,
1156860	1166940	can't be bothered to learn the language he speaks, although he does sort of try.
1166940	1170940	Michael and Job's rivalry isn't the only dynamic we see in these early episodes though.
1170940	1175180	We also get a glimpse of the grotesque as we learn about the relationship between Buster
1175180	1184740	and Lucille.
1184740	1189700	Third dynamic is created by Lucille's need to be needed, and Buster is the one paying
1189700	1191700	the price for that need.
1191700	1195360	Buster breaks away from his mother by becoming romantically involved with Lucille's best
1195360	1206760	friend and rival, Lucille Ostero.
1206760	1210600	While this gesture from Buster wasn't entirely intentional, he was supposed to be bidding
1210600	1215200	on his mother, Buster and Lucille too do develop their own strange dynamic.
1215200	1243640	Lucille fights back by replacing Buster with a boy adopted from Korea, An-Yong.
1243640	1246320	An-Yong is the Korean word for hello.
1246320	1250160	The parallel here between An-Yong and Marta is pretty clear – they're both pawns in
1250160	1252480	the game the Blue Family is playing.
1252480	1257120	Mark that way by not only being outside the family, but outside the broader cultural context
1257120	1258720	the Blues find themselves in.
1258720	1263720	In contrast, Lucille too is a far more developed character, because she lives in that white
1263720	1267640	upper-class world – the world the series is giving us a glimpse into.
1267640	1272760	It reveals the general disinterest these people have for those who are outside their bubble.
1272760	1279920	Even though An-Yong hangs around until the end of the series, the number of appearances
1279920	1284800	he makes dwindles as time goes on, and his role in the finale is more of a bit part for
1284800	1288360	a character who is ostensibly part of the Bluth family.
1288360	1292680	In that way, along with basically reusing the same joke about the Bluths not understanding
1292680	1297360	a word spoken in another language, the show reveals itself to be part of that same world
1297360	1301880	as the Bluths, concerned with the Bluth family but not so much with the people they step
1301880	1302880	on.
1302880	1304680	They're just there to prove a point.
1304680	1308760	The Bluth siblings are very much aware of how their parents have messed up their lives.
1308760	1312240	They even bond with Buster when he dares to criticize their mother.
1312240	1316680	I'm mom and I want to shoot down everything you say so I feel good about myself.
1316680	1318680	Look who's ragging on the old lady.
1318680	1319680	Hey!
1319680	1320680	Finally!
1320680	1321680	I'm an uptight ******!
1321680	1322680	Buster!
1322680	1323680	******!
1323680	1326680	You old horny slut!
1326680	1338000	Well no one's gonna top that.
1338000	1341240	Lucille Bluth is not likely to win Mother of the Year.
1341240	1344680	In the first season, she even attempts to pin a car accident that was absolutely her
1344680	1346200	fault on Michael.
1346200	1350840	The original premise of the series was a family alienated from one another by its wealth,
1350840	1352360	learning how to get along.
1352360	1356460	While the first half of that statement is present, the second half never quite comes
1356460	1357460	to fruition.
1357460	1361260	They're more a family stuck together sharing their misery, and Lucille is the perfect
1361260	1362740	representative of that.
1362740	1367180	Lucille is completely out of touch with the world outside of her wealthy socialite bubble.
1367180	1369180	I mean it's one banana, Michael.
1369180	1370180	What could it cost?
1370180	1371180	Ten dollars?
1371180	1375700	While lines like that reveal Lucille's detachment from the wider world, her relationship with
1375700	1380940	her children is similarly detached, held together not through love, but through manipulation.
1380940	1383940	I just want my children to love me.
1383940	1384940	Stop lying.
1384940	1385940	Stop manipulating.
1385940	1386940	Just be nicer.
1386940	1387940	What?
1387940	1388940	I'm a horrible mother.
1388940	1389940	No, no, my, you crazy mother.
1389940	1390940	That's crazy, Todd.
1390940	1391940	You're a fantastic mother.
1391940	1392940	You're the mother.
1392940	1398940	George Sr. isn't a whole lot better.
1398940	1412380	While he may be in jail for most of the first season, his brief trips out of prison reveal
1412380	1416340	someone less interested in the welfare of his family and more about keeping himself
1416340	1418060	from being locked up for good.
1418060	1420980	George Sr. is a patriarch in many senses of the word.
1420980	1425340	Head of the family, head of the company, and he literally portrays God in one episode.
1425340	1429740	Although when he uses that opportunity to make his escape, the episode very cutely reveals
1429740	1438380	that this is a world where you can't trust in even a heavenly father.
1438380	1442860	George Sr. and Lucille are, quite clearly, awful parents, and the show is very clear
1442860	1446060	to present them as two people not to be trusted.
1446060	1450940	And more than just bad parents, they represent authority and status more broadly, being wealthy
1450940	1452820	and running the Bluth Company.
1452820	1457740	George Sr. as a boss is tough to get a grasp on since he's arrested in the first episode
1457740	1462460	of the series, but the culture created at the Bluth Company is one set up for a domineering
1462460	1467260	boss to control his employees the way a domineering father controls his children.
1467260	1472500	For example, using former employee J. Walter Weatherman, played by Steve Ryan, to teach
1472500	1486820	his kids lessons.
1486820	1490260	When the younger Bluths step into positions of authority, rather than commiserating with
1490260	1494780	the workers knowing what it's like for George Sr. and Lucille to treat them like children,
1494780	1497180	they instead adopt the role of their parents.
1497180	1507420	When Michael takes charge of the company, he leads his employees around like sheep.
1507420	1517700	The Bluths also have family discussions in front of them, as if they aren't even there.
1517700	1522100	Job even organizes the workers not to improve their conditions, but instead to undermine
1522100	1535220	Michael as the one in charge.
1535220	1539180	And going back to Michael, even though he's presented as the responsible one, he expects
1539180	1544300	his workers to work without getting paid, something that reveals a deep level of disrespect
1544300	1546580	even from the normal Bluth.
1546580	1550540	In spite of whatever hardships the Bluths place on one another, they still adhere to
1550540	1556020	their social standing, even when those hardships should be teaching them another lesson entirely.
1556020	1560780	What they learn is to not stand in solidarity with the oppressed, but to claim their birthright
1560780	1562220	as oppressors.
1562220	1574540	Early in the season, Michael discovers a truth about his father.
1574540	1579060	Michael knew his father was guilty of something, but he had no idea it was this bad.
1579060	1583460	And that's another recurring theme of this series, people who seem bad being revealed
1583460	1585100	as even worse.
1585100	1590940	One late addition in season 1 was George Senior's identical twin brother, Oscar George Bluth.
1590940	1594900	The introduction of Oscar came about because creator Mitch Hurwitz happened to see Jeffrey
1594900	1597880	Tambor in a wig, and he thought it looked interesting.
1597880	1602100	So Oscar was written into the show, giving Tambor two recurring characters to play, which
1602100	1606700	is a pretty big step up from initially being cast to a single episode guest role.
1606700	1611020	The reason the Bluth company looms so heavily over the family, defining their relationships,
1611020	1614980	and shaping their goals, is in part because aside from Michael, none of them have a sense
1614980	1625820	for business.
1625820	1630660	This is a family that has largely lived off the largesse of the unethical George Senior,
1630660	1633620	never having to consider what living in the real world means.
1633620	1637500	Throughout season 1, we see how this dynamic has created a family unable to do more than
1637500	1640260	occasionally band together against an outside threat.
1640260	1644300	The rest of the time, they spend bickering and plotting against each other to take control
1644300	1648060	of the company, out of fear that this loss of power will mean they will have to know
1648060	1656900	what it feels like to not be rich.
1656900	1660900	Family isn't there for love or comfort, so much as they're there to help make you
1660900	1661900	money.
1661900	1665420	It's very clearly in this episode where it's revealed that George Senior monetized
1665420	1670380	the rivalry between Job and Michael in a series of tapes called Boy Fights.
1670380	1674140	And more than the alienation caused by their wealth, we see how the Bluth company is so
1674140	1677620	concerned with making money that they're willing to deal with a dictator like Saddam
1677620	1678620	Hussein.
1678620	1702060	Wealth and the pursuit of it has shattered every part of the lives of the Bluth family.
1702060	1706060	They don't trust one another, they live in deluded fantasies about themselves, and
1706060	1710100	have created a company whose workers have been conditioned to behave like children.
1710100	1714200	In short, the Bluths represent everything bad about a society fueled by greed, living
1714200	1718380	in a twisted version of the American greed that creates parodies of families as a means
1718380	1719660	to financial gain.
1719660	1724340	It's almost mocking any workplace where a boss will come in and tell everyone, we're
1724340	1725340	like a family.
1725340	1729220	Except it's a family where a father controls all the children and takes most of the money
1729220	1730580	for himself.
1730580	1734620	In the season finale, Michael once again wants to leave his family, only for circumstances
1734620	1736560	to convince him to stay.
1736560	1758540	With his trial still some time away, George Sr. seemingly has a heart attack and is hospitalized.
1758540	1763100	And that's when the family realized that George Sr. wasn't dead, but was fleeing
1763100	1768020	the country that he loved so very much.
1768020	1772220	This is a nice setup for the next season, which is as good a segue as any to talk about
1772220	1781100	another unique trait of the series, the previews for the next episode.
1781100	1785540	What was especially fun about these is they almost never appeared in the next episode,
1785540	1789380	rather they were fun jokes for an episode to end on, playing on whatever happened in
1789380	1790380	the episode itself.
1790820	1794140	These were originally added because Mitch Hurwitz wanted to get test audiences to say
1794140	1797180	they wanted to see what would happen on the next episode.
1797180	1801100	These previews also reveal a loose relationship with continuity, something the series would
1801100	1806140	be less comfortable with as time went on.
1806140	1810900	The first season of Arrested Development was about establishing its style and tone, demanded
1810900	1816260	much of viewers to follow plotlines and jokes through many twists and turns, all to arrive
1816260	1822080	at the core of a series that had a basic message of how wealth can poison a family.
1822080	1826020	It was a very new way of presenting an old message, and it was that pairing of a new
1826020	1829300	style and familiar message that won the attention of critics.
1829300	1833660	Here's an example of a review of the first episode from a writer at the New York Times
1833660	1835780	shortly before the show premiered.
1835780	1841020	The Bluth heirs are eccentric and warped, but they are not hothouse child prodigies
1841020	1842980	like the Tenenbaum siblings.
1842980	1848500	They are nouveau riche misfits, the ewings of Dallas as seen by Bunuel, and they are
1848500	1850900	quite amusing.
1850900	1854300	As the year went on, critics became increasingly enamored with the show.
1854300	1857740	At the TV Land Awards, it won the Future Classic Award.
1857740	1860940	It wasn't the best predictor for classic television.
1860940	1865160	For every year in which it would go to a massive hit like The Office, there would be other
1865160	1868740	years where it would go to flash in the pans like Heroes.
1868740	1872960	That said, the award meant enough to Arrested Development that the acceptance speech may
1872960	1876240	be nominated on to the first season DVD release of the show.
1876240	1879920	This sentiment would be carried by critics all the way into the Emmys, where Arrested
1879920	1883440	Development was nominated for four awards and won three.
1883440	1887400	Mitch Hurwitz won for writing in a comedy series, The Russo Brothers won for directing
1887400	1891680	in a comedy series, and the show itself won Best Comedy Series, beating out the likes
1891680	1897480	of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Everybody Loves Raymond, Sex in the City, and Will and Grace.
1897480	1901520	Special attention should be given to how Hurwitz ended his acceptance speech for Best Comedy
1901520	1905880	Series.
1905880	1910800	Saying let's watch it was a reminder that, in this absolute love-bomb of critical praise
1910800	1915440	from the TV critics, very few people were actually watching the show, a sentiment that
1915440	1917920	can be seen during interviews at the time.
1917920	1922480	My dream has always been to work on a show, regardless of what that show is, that holds
1922480	1933920	Malcolm's numbers, and if it doesn't happen, you move on, you move on.
1933920	1936640	So just how bad were the ratings?
1936640	1940560	While the first episode debuted to just under 8 million viewers, by the end of the first
1940560	1943400	season it was down to less than 6.
1943400	1946880	Its average for the year was 6.2 million viewers.
1946880	1951400	Its lead-in, Malcolm in the Middle, while not a ratings juggernaut, was still doing significantly
1951400	1956040	better beginning the season with 10 million viewers, ending with 8 million viewers, and
1956040	1959640	having an average of 8.35 million viewers.
1959640	1963880	There was a small uptake in the ratings on March 17th when the show was given the coveted
1963880	1969200	spot following American Idol, giving the show its highest rating ever with 9.6 million viewers.
1969200	1972840	But even though this one episode was moved to the middle of the week for a one-off attempt
1972840	1977640	to garner a new audience, it ended up losing nearly 60% of the people who were watching
1977640	1978800	American Idol.
1978800	1983040	And looking at ratings for the following weeks, it seems none of that 3 million audience
1983040	1988040	surplus seemed to follow Arrested Development back to its Sunday night time slot.
1988040	1994040	Aside from cops, Arrested Development was the lowest-rated show on Fox not to get cancelled.
1994040	1997680	In overall viewing numbers, it was ranked 105th.
1997680	2000180	Things weren't looking good ratings-wise.
2000180	2004840	In an article from Entertainment Weekly, some concerns were expressed by the network.
2004840	2009080	Fox Entertainment president Gail Berman admits Arrested Development's numbers are
2009080	2010080	troubling.
2010080	2013800	Still, she insists the network is an abandoning hope.
2013800	2014800	Yet.
2014800	2016880	Look, I love this show, she says.
2016880	2020160	We're trying to figure out every possible way we can help it.
2020160	2024360	Hurwitz in interviews years later expressed that he believed the network was considering
2024360	2028640	cancelling the show but only relented after all of the critical acclaim, particularly
2028640	2031280	because of the awards it was winning.
2031280	2033760	Therefore they felt like they had to keep it on the air.
2033800	2037880	By winning the Emmy for Best Comedy series, along with two others, it was hoped that these
2037880	2042240	successes would turn things around for the series, giving it a bigger profile, attracting
2042240	2045920	a wider audience, and telling a huge comeback story.
2045920	2049200	They didn't, but it would have been.
2049200	2052880	Season 2 opens with Michael heading back to the family because he isn't sure they really
2052880	2055280	got how serious he was about leaving.
2055280	2057840	I think we're still there.
2057840	2058840	We're going back.
2058840	2063560	Michael is once again trapped with his family, only now he's implicated in George Sr's
2063560	2065400	dealings with Saddam Hussein.
2065400	2069120	And evidence he needs to clear himself is stolen by George Sr, effectively throwing
2069120	2071560	his own son under the bus to save himself.
2071560	2072920	He's not a great dad.
2072920	2077780	George Sr's ties to Saddam Hussein, revealing the interest of private business in earning
2077780	2082320	a profit over national security, is just one of many political observations made throughout
2082320	2083320	the series.
2083320	2087680	In the same episode, we see Buster enlist into the army by Lucille when she's confronted
2087680	2091200	by a legally distinct version of Michael Moore.
2092200	2101200	Although Lucille would later regret it, it does
2101200	2105200	underscore the desperation of the US military if they're willing to accept a guy like
2105200	2106840	Buster into their ranks.
2106840	2111680	As the next two seasons progress, the political commentary gets increasingly obvious.
2111680	2116520	The Patriot Act, a controversial piece of post-9-11 legislation that gave the US government
2116520	2120960	greater surveillance power, is mocked when it's used to obtain a photo of bunkers with
2120960	2127000	weapons of mass destruction, not realizing that this photo is actually of Tobias' balls.
2132760	2137120	George Sr is found in a hole similar to the one Saddam Hussein was hiding in, and at one
2137120	2141440	point he records a video that very much presents him looking like Osama bin Laden.
2141440	2145680	The beliefs even find themselves in a rock, meeting Saddam Hussein impersonators living
2145680	2151800	in the Iraqi version of the model home, complete with what appears to be a weapon of mass destruction.
2151800	2156400	I haven't even mentioned references to the cut and run talking point, the George W. Bush
2156400	2161560	mission accomplished photo op, the Rumsfeld photo parody, and so many more.
2161560	2165280	Arrested development was diving into political comedy in a way no other sitcom at the time
2165280	2166280	was.
2166280	2170120	Towards the end of the third season, we also learn that George Sr has secretly been working
2170120	2172360	with the US government this whole time.
2176440	2180080	Yeah, we got some guy named George Bluth to build houses down there so we could wire them.
2180080	2184120	The Bluths are portrayed as entrenched in the government establishment, and are also
2184120	2186040	working with Saddam Hussein.
2186040	2189640	Although Hussein's reign wasn't welcomed by the United States when it began, his war
2189640	2194480	with Iran did make him a temporary ally, an uneasy partnership that went south when Iraq
2194480	2196320	went on to invade Kuwait.
2196320	2200480	The Bluths represent the capriciousness of these relationships, dependent on economic
2200480	2205160	ties as oil can be traced to the root of many of these real-world conflicts.
2205160	2208600	Although Arrested Development was more concerned with showing how incredibly silly all of
2208600	2213520	this was, it also revealed a cynicism towards American foreign policy that was rarely seen
2213520	2216160	in the immediate post-9-11 era.
2216160	2220720	It's a sharp rebuke of the unthinking patriotism that you often saw on TV shows, instead opting
2220720	2225000	to portray how the American government and big businesses are happy to collude with supposed
2225000	2228160	enemies if it meant keeping the price of oil down.
2228160	2232600	Another big part of this series is the increasingly sour relationship between Tobias and Lindsay.
2232600	2237880	As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.
2237880	2238880	Really?
2238880	2239880	When did that start?
2239880	2243880	Well, I don't want to blame it all on 9-11, but...
2243880	2248160	We get a hint of why their marriage is failing in the first episode of this series.
2248160	2249160	You're gay.
2249160	2250160	No, no.
2250160	2251160	No, I'm not.
2251160	2252160	I'm not gay.
2252160	2255880	No, Lindsay, how many times must we have this?
2255880	2256880	No.
2256880	2261440	Assumptions about Tobias' sexuality come up again many times throughout the series'
2261440	2288960	run, usually because of his unusual choice of words.
2288960	2294020	The irony here being that Tobias, as a trained analyst and therapist, isn't able to infer
2294020	2301680	some deeper meaning behind the unusual way he speaks.
2301680	2306620	Tobias actively rejecting expectations of his gender leads people to suspect he may
2306620	2311960	be gay, or the fact that he's a never-nude, which means he can never go anywhere without
2311960	2316320	wearing a pair of cutoffs, and that he often uses female pronouns when drawing analogies
2316320	2319400	to himself may even suggest that he's trans.
2319400	2323520	In her essay on the character, Darcy Dahl, an assistant professor of philosophy at Delta
2323520	2328840	College, describes how the real lesson here is to not treat Tobias' sexuality or gender
2328840	2333280	identity as some kind of guessing game, but instead reflect on what that says about the
2333280	2335760	expectations we place on people.
2335760	2336760	She writes,
2336760	2340760	What a person like Tobias shows us is that we needn't conserve ourselves with fitting
2340760	2342520	into a specific mold.
2342520	2346720	We need not worry about whether we're too feminine or masculine, nor about whether our
2346720	2350880	sexuality or personality conforms to normal standards.
2350880	2353760	Perhaps we should all try to find the Tobias inside of us.
2353760	2357960	While there are plenty of things in Tobias we can find fault with, such as his neglect
2357960	2362320	of his daughter, his inability to leave a doomed marriage, or his ridiculous attempts
2362320	2366620	to try and become an actor, when it comes to his sexuality or gender, he doesn't seem
2366620	2368280	to be distressed by it.
2368280	2370880	So how is it anyone else's business?
2370880	2374960	Even if he does have some kind of deep internal conflicts, instead of telling him what those
2374960	2380000	are, what he needs is a loving, caring space to explore those feelings himself and find
2380000	2383560	his own way through them, which again, is something he may not even need.
2383560	2386880	It's also something he'll never find in the Blue Family.
2386880	2390480	Lindsay struggles to find a life outside of her marriage with Tobias being asked to leave
2390480	2391480	the model home.
2391480	2392480	Like what you see?
2392480	2395640	I've been looking for those, you're gonna stretch them out.
2395640	2396640	That's all you can say?
2396640	2400000	Well, excuse me for liking the way they shaped my junk.
2400000	2402560	I don't know why, but that's it.
2402560	2405680	You can pack your junk and get out.
2405680	2411480	And Tobias has to worm his way back in by posing as a British danny named Mrs. Featherbottom.
2411480	2413480	Who'd like a banger in the mouth?
2413480	2414480	Oh, right, I forgot.
2414480	2419560	Here in the States you call it a sausage in the mouth.
2419560	2420880	We just call it a sausage.
2420880	2424980	Although Lindsay assumes Tobias is doing this because he misses maybe, the truth is, either
2424980	2428860	she nor Tobias are very concerned with the happenings of their daughter.
2428860	2432940	The Funke family is crumbling because of Tobias' nursing this ridiculous dream about
2432940	2437300	becoming a doctor, and Lindsay is trying to maintain her life as a philanthropist while
2437300	2441620	dating outside her marriage, and they're each living off the fumes of the family fortune,
2441620	2443740	doing nothing to adapt to their new circumstances.
2443740	2447500	They're so clueless that they're not even sure their marriage is over or not.
2447500	2451580	Maybe the fact that we don't know if we're together or not is a sign that we should split
2451580	2452580	again.
2452580	2453820	Or stay split up.
2453820	2455580	Okay, forget about Vegas.
2455580	2457900	We'll stay here and get back together.
2457900	2462380	This reveals the level of rot that sets in the minds of people living off of fabulous
2462380	2465980	wealth, particularly when they had nothing to do with its creation.
2465980	2470120	Tobias and Lindsay have spent much of their adult lives living off their whims, especially
2470120	2472620	Lindsay's whim to become married to Tobias.
2472620	2477200	It's a reflection of a life lived without consequences for those whims, and maybe is
2477200	2481900	left out in the cold, born into a family that barely pays attention to her.
2481900	2486060	Luckily for her, she manages to connive her way into becoming a teenage movie executive.
2487060	2495220	These two seasons also saw a number of changes for Buster.
2495220	2498860	After joining the army, he lost his hand to a dangerous seal attack.
2498860	2508860	And then a seal bites off his hand.
2508860	2523100	We also learn that Buster's father may not be George Sr.
2523100	2540460	A
2540460	2544620	key part of Buster's story is this bizarre moment where Lucille is confronted.
2544620	2555340	Oh, this guy always gets me.
2555340	2559060	Although George Michael's crush on his cousin was firmly established in season one, over
2559060	2564340	time we see him develop a new interest in Anne Veal.
2564340	2565340	Michael isn't a fan.
2565340	2569540	Although much of the series establishes he finds her bland and uninteresting, there is
2569540	2579100	another side to his lack of an appreciation.
2579100	2583700	There's something particularly gross about a grown man making jokes about a teenage girl's
2583700	2584700	weight.
2584700	2588180	And even though Mae Whitman, for many of her scenes, is wearing a fat suit, or at least
2588180	2593100	the hips of a fat suit, according to the actress, she just doesn't seem particularly overweight.
2593100	2597940	It's a strange vocal point for Michael and reveals him to be not quite the nice guy he
2597940	2599580	tries to present himself as.
2599580	2604060	It's a subtle reminder that there are no good bluths in the show.
2604060	2609460	Even while he's romancing Anne, George Michael still has an attraction to his cousin.
2609460	2622960	When the two of them kiss in the season two finale, the model home literally sinks.
2622960	2626940	And while this gets awkwardly ignored in season three, we do get some closure for the George
2626940	2628900	Michael relationship with Anne.
2628900	2634700	She dumps him.
2634700	2638980	Third season did show us a relationship blossoming though, and it's perhaps the most controversial
2638980	2643740	one in the series, Michael's relationship with Rita Leeds, played by Charlize Theron.
2643740	2647940	Let's just jump right to a fact that the series takes several episodes to reveal.
2647940	2651980	Rita has a mental health condition that is unfortunately revealed through the use of
2651980	2653420	an ableist slur.
2653420	2658360	Michael is unable to notice for several episodes because she's British and incredibly beautiful,
2658360	2660480	so he assumes she's being quirky.
2660480	2665060	When he proposes and nearly has sex with her, he only stops after learning the truth.
2665060	2678560	And then he ends things with Rita.
2678560	2682400	This half-season arc has gotten some critical attention over the years, though aside from
2682400	2687140	the use of a certain word and the childlike innocence archetype Rita is slotted into,
2687140	2692060	the series does make an effort to create a more well-rounded character who has wants
2692060	2693220	and desires of her own.
2693220	2696940	It's a level of depth we didn't get to see for other love interests of Michael, such
2696940	2697940	as Marta.
2697940	2701720	Although it's worth mentioning that Rita is fabulously wealthy, putting her in a closer
2701720	2705020	social standing to the Bluths than someone like Marta.
2705020	2707720	Being white and British I'm sure helps as well.
2707720	2711280	One thing Arrested Development does that's unlike a lot of other shows is including a
2711280	2715260	number of characters with disabilities, visible or otherwise.
2715260	2719820	Even members of the principal cast have disabilities, such as Tobias being a never nude and Buster
2719820	2724840	losing his hand, while in the case of Buster, laughing at him for losing a hand and treating
2724840	2727440	him like a machine can seem a bit cruel.
2727440	2730280	And Tobias being a never nude is just a punchline.
2730280	2734820	The show's record on characters with disabilities does become more complex when looking at the
2734820	2736280	supporting cast.
2736280	2738480	For Slate, Inku Kang wrote,
2738480	2742700	It's hard to think of another series that features so many different kinds of disabilities
2742700	2747220	while ensuring that the people with those syndromes are more than their impairments.
2747220	2752000	In fact, they are, with a single glaring exception, just like the rest of the show's version
2752000	2753000	of Orange County.
2753000	2758840	Vain, Vindictive, Pompous, Dishonest, Opportunistic, and or Oblivious.
2758840	2763100	These characters fit so seamlessly into the rest of the show's universe that they silently
2763100	2768460	expose how cloying and or exoticizing Hollywood's usual stereotypes about people with disabilities
2768460	2769460	are.
2769460	2775900	Inspirational, Asexual, Tragic, Brilliant, or Superpowered, a victim or a villain.
2775900	2778700	They're impairments poised to be overcome.
2778700	2782460	One of the major through lines in the series is the impact between generations within a
2782460	2783460	family.
2783460	2787740	And this can be seen in one of the key relationships between a father and son.
2787740	2790460	Michael and his son, George Michael.
2790460	2793780	Michael is determined to raise his son in a loving way that his father hadn't for
2793780	2794780	him.
2794780	2799260	In the second episode, we see how Michael does that when he confers the important responsibility
2799260	2802740	of running the family banana stand on George Michael.
2802740	2805380	Don't look at me, Mr. Manager.
2805380	2806380	It's up to me now.
2806380	2807380	I'm Mr. Manager.
2807380	2808380	Manager?
2808380	2809380	We just say...
2809380	2810380	I know, but...
2810380	2812740	It doesn't matter who.
2812740	2817380	The subtle joke here is that Michael is denying his son the adult Mr. Title, not letting him
2817380	2818380	grow up.
2818380	2820620	A key part of the relationship.
2820620	2823900	The two Bluth boys struggle to communicate with one another.
2823900	2827900	And while Michael remembers his father being a controlling tyrant, he exercises his own
2827900	2829580	brand of control over George Michael.
2829580	2831740	I'll work weeknights, I'll lay people off.
2831740	2833660	I'll give up my summer, all my summers.
2833660	2835980	Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.
2835980	2840060	Michael realized he had done to his son what his father had done to him.
2840060	2843180	Michael doesn't want to be like his father, but the way he's raised George Michael is
2843180	2847820	a lot like the way George Sr. raised him, such as getting them to be incredibly hard
2847820	2848820	on themselves.
2848820	2849820	What?
2849820	2850820	No, you stupid jerk.
2850820	2851820	Why not?
2851820	2852820	Dumb.
2852820	2853820	Dumb.
2853860	2855200	Dumb, George Michael.
2855200	2856700	Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.
2856700	2858420	Whoa, calm down, you two.
2858420	2859580	It's just a math problem.
2859580	2863480	Yeah, but if I fail math, there goes my chance at a good job and a happy life full of hard
2863480	2864480	work.
2864480	2865480	Like you always say.
2865480	2868500	I know, but it's my fault I've been pushing him too hard.
2868500	2871020	It's just dumb, dumb, dumb, Michael, dumb.
2871020	2872020	Shh, shh, I forgive you.
2872020	2875860	The intergenerational impact of bad parenting is felt throughout the series.
2875860	2879620	It's this relationship that carries the heart of the series in the early seasons, and would
2879620	2883340	be one major thing to keep in mind for the fourth season, though that wouldn't be coming
2883340	2884700	for another eight years.
2884700	2889180	Fox finally pulled the plug on Arrested Development, with its third season order being cut to a
2889180	2894580	lean 13 episodes, the final four bearing in opposition to the Winter Olympics.
2894580	2899420	The series did make several attempts to appeal to a wider audience, though they never quite
2899420	2900580	resonated.
2900580	2905380	The second season also used some very heavy-handed product placement to earn some goodwill and
2905380	2916260	extra ad revenue for the network.
2916260	2921220	In the third season, after learning the show was being cancelled, a special Save Our Bluths-themed
2921220	2927100	episode, titled SOBs, parodied every stunt that shows used to goose the ratings, from
2927100	2940020	guest stars to shots in 3D.
2940020	2950900	At one point, they even resorted to begging.
2950900	2954860	When this episode aired, the writing was more or less on the wall, Fox would no longer be
2954860	2958780	home for Arrested Development, and the show even made coy remarks about the future of
2958780	2971780	the show.
2971780	2975460	At one point we see the show contrast its own brand of complex characters with other
2975460	3000820	TV sitcoms.
3000820	3009980	It's almost defensive in how firmly the show asserts itself as something transgressive
3009980	3013560	in the sitcom's space, and at the time, there was some truth to that.
3013560	3017980	There was an abundance of mediocre sitcoms on the air, using tired yet familiar gags
3017980	3020180	to attract audiences looking for something comfortable.
3020180	3024700	But it wasn't as if other genre-dying shows weren't finding success, and blaming the
3024700	3026820	audience isn't always the best bet.
3026820	3046300	Michael himself acknowledges this when he says, In the season 3 finale, Development
3046300	3051620	Arrested, we find the Bluths once again on a boat, much in the way the series began.
3051620	3055780	George Sr. is free, and we learn Lucille was the real brains behind the Bluth company,
3055780	3065700	and Lindsay finds out she's adopted.
3065700	3071060	Sharp-eyed viewers also noticed a subtle reference to the show's strong sales on DVD.
3071060	3075180	Other bombshells include learning that Anne is dating Job, who then gets punched in the
3075180	3079940	face by George Michael, and Michael realizes he succeeded in his mission.
3079940	3097820	When Michael realizes his son is hurting after learning about Job's betrayal, he
3097820	3106260	wants to comfort him, and he learns something important when Lucille tries to stop him.
3106260	3110500	It was at that moment that Michael realized how much he'd sold out.
3110500	3115340	As Michael runs off to be with his son, Lucille sells the company to stand sit-well in a panic,
3115340	3125580	as An-Yong is revealed to have betrayed the Bluths.
3125580	3140820	And the show ends on the crucial relationship.
3140820	3154260	And the epilogue gives us one last gasp of hope.
3155580	3159940	And so ends the first three seasons of Arrested Development, hitting the important beats of
3159940	3164140	how families and businesses should be kept distinct, the sinister relationship between
3164140	3167780	the American government and the business world, and that wealth can rot the connections within
3167780	3168780	a family.
3168780	3172100	But it's hard to focus on the themes of the show with all the loud raging over its
3172100	3174020	untimely cancellation.
3174020	3178140	Although there were brief flashes of self-awareness, such as the few words from Michael in the
3178140	3183220	SOB episode, most of the time this was a show that was clearly kicking and screaming as
3183220	3184500	it went off the air.
3184500	3187540	Not that it didn't have some ground for that, but it does complicate a reading of
3187540	3188540	it.
3188540	3192060	The text becomes less about the characters and their antics and more about the context
3192060	3193500	the show found itself in.
3193500	3197220	While the curtain was coming down on the show for now, with some of its lowest ratings thanks
3197220	3205380	to the love of critics and a passionate fanbase, it wouldn't be quickly forgotten.
3205380	3209260	Upon entering its second season, ratings for Arrested Development weren't really helped
3209260	3210460	by its Emmy wins.
3210460	3214260	It didn't do any worse, but it didn't do a whole lot better either.
3214260	3219900	The second season averaged 5.9 million viewers per episode, only slightly down from Season
3219900	3222100	1's 6.2 million.
3222100	3226580	Although ratings remained low, the show surprisingly got picked up for a third season in an Entertainment
3226580	3227780	Weekly article.
3227780	3232820	Peter Leguri, the new Fox Broadcasting President of Entertainment, said in a statement,
3232820	3236020	Arrested Development is one of the best comedies on television.
3236020	3239940	The decision to order another season becomes easy when you consider its amazing cast, creative
3239940	3242580	brilliance, critical acclaim, and advertiser appeal.
3242580	3247380	It's my first official pick-up since taking the job and I think it's a great way to start.
3247380	3252940	One change was the show being moved from Sunday nights at 9.30 to Monday nights at 8.
3252940	3254780	It fared even worse than the ratings.
3254780	3259460	The third season would go on to average 3.9 million viewers, losing 2 million from the
3259460	3264700	previous season, albeit that does include four episodes that were aired directly against
3264700	3267100	the Olympics, dragging down the overall average.
3267100	3271020	The low ratings hurt morale on the show, and that was likely made worse when the full season
3271020	3274260	was cut down to a 13-episode half-season.
3274260	3277820	Although Mitch Hurwitz was in talks to bring the series to showtime for a fourth season,
3277820	3280220	ultimately these negotiations fell through.
3280220	3284100	Part of the reason, as Hurwitz would later explain, was because of his own fatigue running
3284100	3285940	such a detailed series.
3285940	3287780	In an interview, he said,
3287780	3290780	In truth, I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series.
3290780	3294620	I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I think a lot
3294620	3296640	of the actors were ready to move on.
3296640	3300140	My first instinct was that it was over when Fox pulled the plug.
3300140	3304920	I considered continuing the show because I felt I owed that to the fans, but I am determined
3304920	3309880	to give them some other kind of entertainment that will satisfy them at some point, I hope.
3309880	3313940	Even though Arrested Development had a record low viewership, the main demographic appears
3313940	3319020	to have been movie studio executives, so hopefully the cast will be able to benefit from that.
3319020	3322540	Even if the show had been picked up for a fourth season, Hurwitz expressed that he likely
3322540	3326860	would have taken a backseat role, unable to keep up the pace of running a show that was
3326860	3328940	built on so many small details.
3328940	3332720	The third season in particular seems to have really demotivated him and everyone working
3332720	3338080	on the show because of a lack of faith in how it was presented and promoted by the network.
3338080	3341480	Although the audience for Arrested Development was small, they were particularly passionate,
3341480	3345280	and when it came time to point fingers, many of them were directed at Fox.
3345280	3347560	This wasn't entirely spontaneous, though.
3347560	3352120	In the same way the instant classic label was encouraged by the DVD release of the first
3352120	3356320	season, the second season's DVD set had a message of its own buried at the end of the
3356320	3358660	season 2 blooper reel featurette.
3358660	3362620	I got an idea for what you can do, why don't you f***ing fire your complete marketing team
3362620	3366780	or get a new one in there, notice how to market a show that won five motherf***ing Emmys,
3366780	3372900	Golden Globes, SAG Awards, WGA Awards, DGA Awards, Producers Guilds Awards, Critics Top
3372900	3373900	Ten lists.
3373900	3378940	You know, if you can't market that kind of show and get better ratings, then maybe the
3378940	3381060	problem doesn't lie here.
3381060	3382700	Maybe it lies with marketing.
3382700	3384180	Good night.
3384180	3386740	Good night, thank you very much.
3386740	3390500	David Cross's frustration at the network was a pivotal moment, and really shaped the
3390500	3392540	perception of why the show failed.
3392540	3396660	It was moved to different time slots, it wasn't advertised the right way, or the network simply
3396660	3397980	didn't believe in it.
3397980	3400540	Looking at the evidence, not all of that is true.
3400540	3404200	The show had a very stable time slot, aside from that one episode in the first season
3404200	3408220	that was placed after an episode of American Idol, and the final four episodes being programmed
3408220	3411780	against the Olympics, which was decided well after the show had been cancelled.
3411780	3415580	It often didn't air new episodes on consecutive weeks, but the same was true for other shows
3415580	3418020	on the same night, which tended to perform better.
3418020	3421140	To say the network simply didn't believe in the show is a bit of a stretch when it
3421140	3424780	ran for two and a half seasons, with ratings that would get most other shows cancelled
3424780	3427180	in less than half that amount of time.
3427180	3429460	None of that is to say the network is blameless, though.
3429460	3434060	Arrested Development is a hard show to sell, but Fox was unable to capitalize on its acclaim
3434060	3436340	and loyal fanbase to reach a wider audience.
3436340	3440340	A brilliant show doesn't naturally find an audience if a network isn't entirely sure
3440340	3442500	how to find that audience.
3442500	3446620	In 2011, Mitch Hurwitz wrote an article for The Guardian titled, Arrested Development
3446620	3449980	creator Mitch Hurwitz's guide to getting a sitcom cancelled.
3449980	3454300	In it, he has some unflinching reflections on why the show failed to connect to audiences.
3454300	3455660	Here are a few examples.
3455660	3458540	Try to do too much for a 20-minute program.
3458540	3462700	If in your particular medium an audience is used to a simple plot line or maybe one or
3462700	3467940	two stories, see if you can get aid in there, and find a way that they somehow intertwine.
3467940	3469100	Add a sprinkle of incest.
3469300	3471380	They'll never admit it, but viewers love sex.
3471380	3475140	In fact, they love any sort of titillation, with the exception of incest.
3475140	3476660	So focus on that.
3476660	3479840	First impressions are everything, so if you can screw that up, you're made.
3479840	3483900	With Arrested Development, we tried showing the deep disdain that connects a family.
3483900	3488340	We wanted to hold up a mirror to American society, and just as predicted, America looked
3488340	3489340	away.
3489340	3491260	Make easy jokes about minority groups.
3491260	3496860	Whether they be Mexicans, Jews, or homosexuals, any group can be dismissed with a few stereotypical
3496860	3497860	cracks.
3497860	3499140	That's what we tried to do.
3499140	3503420	And given their lack of coming to the party, it seems we succeeded.
3503420	3508060	That last word in particular is worth considering, as there is a distinction to think about when
3508060	3510300	it comes to edgy humor.
3510300	3515140	While Arrested Development did have a few tasteless jokes about certain identity groups,
3515140	3519740	sometimes being outright racist, it typically had even more jokes about the oblivious bluths
3519740	3521820	and their racist attitudes.
3521820	3525580	In many cases, the bluths were the butt of the racially charged jokes.
3525580	3530460	For example, when Job brings out his racist puppet Franklin, the joke here is that Job
3530460	3540500	is a racist.
3540500	3552420	The episode even makes a decent bit of racial commentary.
3552420	3555620	So maybe not all the racial humor on the show was offensive.
3555620	3560040	But a question worth asking is, even if something isn't offensive, is it something someone
3560040	3562900	from one of these groups would actually want to watch?
3562900	3566620	Perhaps more than the racism, rather, it's that a show centered around a rich white family
3566620	3570900	gets less interesting the further the audience gets away from that experience.
3570900	3574860	There are plenty of examples of shows ahead of their time that had weak first seasons,
3574860	3576500	only to catch on some time later.
3576500	3579860	Cheers was one of the lowest rated shows on network TV when it aired.
3579860	3583840	Seinfeld went from a solid performer to one of the highest rated shows on television.
3583840	3588700	But those were shows that began in the 80s, and Arrested Development began in 2003.
3588700	3592740	The realities of network television were changing, with more channels to compete against and
3592740	3594580	more people DVR-ing shows.
3594580	3599320	It was tougher for a niche show to get a chance to grow, because audiences were fragmenting.
3599320	3603740	There was one unique advantage Arrested Development had been in the mid-2000, and that's the
3603740	3605780	benefit of DVD sales.
3605780	3609580	Although it's tough to find hard numbers, sales for Arrested Development DVDs were
3609580	3614420	quoted as being somewhere around 3 million units sold in the United States in an article
3614420	3616500	that was published in 2013.
3616500	3620660	The Numbers, a website that estimates the sales of media, claims that the third season
3620660	3626220	of Arrested Development sold roughly 400,000 units in its first three weeks, with an audience
3626220	3630860	of under 4 million, that's a very high conversion rate of people buying DVDs.
3630860	3636740	While these numbers would be dwarfed by powerhouses in the TV-DVD space, such as Family Guy,
3636740	3641100	it was still a sign that, at the very least, Arrested Development had a dedicated enough
3641100	3649020	fan base not to let the show vanish into the night.
3649020	3653180	In the years between Arrested Development's cancellation and return, the series was kept
3653180	3657900	alive in the minds of the public with rumors of a supposed movie being in the works.
3657900	3662220	The cast and creative team would, on occasion, stoke those rumors, but a lot of it was driven
3662220	3665420	by a fan base hungry for more Arrested Development.
3665420	3669660	Writing for The Verge, Keith Phipps offers some insight into this time.
3669660	3671340	Here's some inside baseball.
3671340	3676940	If you worked at a pop culture website between 2006 and 2013, running items about Arrested
3676940	3680860	Development's long-rumored return was like printing page views.
3680860	3685340	In addition to having a voracious fan base, Arrested Development was also fortunate to
3685340	3689740	have critics in position of influence to ensure that the series was held in high regard,
3689740	3693740	frequently placing it on lists of the all-time greatest TV shows.
3693740	3698220	This period is what started to cement the idea of Arrested Development being canonized
3698220	3700300	as one of the all-time TV greats.
3700300	3705020	It was unique, daring, and canceled before its time, everything to make it a darling,
3705020	3708940	and its reputation was helping it find a wider audience even off the air.
3708940	3713260	In TV history, shows that are considered all-time classics are often those that drew a massive
3713260	3717180	audience, but a space has always been carved out for smaller shows that were canceled before
3717180	3719900	their time, usually because they were very influential.
3719900	3723660	That space is reserved for shows that are not remembered by a mass audience, but rather
3723660	3726860	critics or a passionate fan base that keep it from being forgotten.
3726860	3730140	Historically, this is closer to how other forms of art are remembered.
3730140	3734700	Although popularity is a helpful boost, a mass audience tends to move on from a work
3734700	3739020	of art as time goes on, so it falls to critics, academics, and the most passionate
3739020	3741820	appreciators of a field of art to preserve its memory.
3741820	3744380	With television, things become more complicated.
3744380	3748380	It's rare for any long-running TV series to have its best episodes or moments in the
3748380	3749500	first season or two.
3749500	3753820	Oftentimes, shows will find that their third, fourth, or fifth seasons are among their
3753820	3758300	strongest, but it could only get there if it could build on a base of popular support.
3758860	3763020	This is why popularity is always important to consider when thinking of the all-time
3763020	3764140	TV greats.
3764140	3768380	A movie, a song, or a book is a finished product and is going to reach the highest
3768380	3772540	potential it can, but a show that keeps running has room to grow and improve.
3772540	3775740	This makes Arrested Development's accomplishment of becoming considered a
3775740	3777820	classic so quickly even more impressive.
3777820	3780140	Throughout the years following the cancellation of the show,
3780140	3784940	fansites started popping up online, including the Balboa Observer, the Inconvenient
3784940	3787180	Bluth, and the Banana Stand.
3787180	3790860	Fansites in particular were a fitting homage, as the show itself was constantly
3790860	3794540	putting together mock websites that were briefly mentioned on an episode.
3794540	3798700	The series itself almost seems built for internet fandom, as part of the fun involved
3798700	3802460	diving into each episode, finding foreshadowing for future events.
3802460	3805900	Like a vague reference to a dangerous seal attacking people several episodes
3805900	3807740	before it would bite off Buster's hand.
3812140	3816380	Or a guy who bears a striking resemblance to one of Saddam Hussein's sons appearing
3816380	3817500	at a Bluth Company event.
3817980	3820700	Is that Kusei Hussein at the omelet bar?
3820700	3825500	All these little details became catnip for a fanbase that was all too happy to dissect them.
3825500	3830380	In many ways, this has even influenced how other fandoms have deconstructed shows on the internet,
3830380	3835500	hyperfixating on every detail in a trailer or an episode, trying to connect various narrative
3835500	3839820	strands. While Arrested Development fans certainly didn't invent this way of looking at media,
3839820	3842140	they did help popularize it on the internet.
3842140	3846780	There is a downside to this though. It's helped give us an online culture that is less inclined
3846780	3851980	to discuss the themes or experiences of watching something to instead try and find any small
3851980	3855500	detail that appears more than once and calling it a day.
3855500	3860860	While no specific way of watching a TV show is correct or better than the other, I personally
3860860	3865260	appreciate a more balanced approach. It's fun to find easter eggs, but I think it's fun to do
3865260	3869900	something with those eggs to shape one's understanding of what a show is trying to say.
3869900	3873580	The series even inspired fans to create a documentary that included interviews with
3873580	3876620	cast members and other people involved with the production of the series.
3876620	3881020	It also interviewed a number of fans, all expressing their undying love for the series.
3881020	3885180	After what seemed like an endless series of teases, eventually it was revealed that Arrested
3885180	3891820	Development was coming back from the land of dead TV shows. It was what fans thought was a dream come
3891820	3900300	true. On October 2nd, 2011, the cast of Arrested Development, along with Ron Howard and Mitch
3900300	3904700	Hurwitz, all gathered for a reunion at the New Yorker Festival. It was here we got the first
3904700	3908060	real indicator that the show would be returning for a limited run.
3925020	3928940	About six weeks later, it was announced that Netflix would be the new home for this new run
3928940	3933820	of episodes, convinced in part by the show's strong streaming and DVD performance. Rather
3933820	3937980	than renewing the life of the series and continuing to produce new seasons, this was
3937980	3943100	intended to be a standalone season. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings described it saying,
3943100	3948460	Arrested Development is a wildly successful tactic, as opposed to fundamental to the strategy.
3948460	3953980	In August of 2012, a rough date was given for the series' return, spring of 2013.
3953980	3958140	One of the major challenges for the fourth season was that, thanks in no small part to
3958140	3963500	the critical success of the original three seasons, the cast had become very hot commodities, so
3963500	3968300	working out the time to film ten episodes of a fourth season was a real challenge.
3968300	3972780	Hurwitz decided that, instead of trying to recreate the ensemble dynamic of the earlier
3972780	3977660	seasons, he would instead use these episodes to focus on the individual characters, making it
3977660	3982620	easier to film around the schedules of the actors. In fact, this project wasn't even originally
3982620	3988140	intended to be a self-contained fourth season. Rather, the idea was for a series of shorts that
3988140	3992460	would lead to an eventual movie. Hype for the series eventually turned this into a full-blown
3992460	3997420	season, but the movie was always going to be part of the plan. In an interview, Hurwitz said,
3997420	4001820	The master plan is to do these episodes and then do the movie, where the family is all together,
4001820	4006140	and it's very much written and directed in that direction. It all leads to a bigger story.
4006140	4010780	It's kind of the preamble, although hopefully it'll be satisfying in its own right.
4010780	4015420	The fourth season was really more of an act one that would hopefully lead into a movie with acts
4015420	4020300	two and three. Although originally planned to be ten episodes, with Jason Bateman appearing in all
4020300	4025100	of them and the rest of the cast being featured in one episode each, the series kept getting larger
4025100	4029740	in the planning stages. Eventually it would grow to fifteen episodes. Episodes would still feature
4029740	4033980	a character from the Blue Family, only some characters got two episodes and others only
4033980	4039660	won. Hurwitz was pushed to his limits organizing the series. David Cross in an interview describes
4039660	4043900	what it was like visiting Hurwitz's office. You know the murder scene where they go to the
4043900	4048540	psycho killer's apartment and he's got all this crazy sh** mapped out? That's what it looked like.
4048540	4053580	Post-it notes and index cards all across the three walls into this big conference room,
4053580	4058140	yarn stretching from one thing to another and pinned in one place, and then a sharp angular
4058140	4063500	uptick to the Lucille character and down. And then there's a different colored yarn that intersects
4063500	4068140	and weaves in. It took Hurwitz 25 minutes to explain what I was looking at and I still didn't
4068140	4073100	get everything. When you see that, of course it has to be a TV show. There's no way else to do this.
4073820	4078700	Episodes weren't filmed separately. Rather, multiple scenes were shot each day regardless
4078700	4083020	of the episode they were in. Scripts were rewritten or sometimes only half finished,
4083020	4087660	so many lines were written on the set. In an interview, director Troy Miller said,
4087660	4091260	There's never been a half hour comedy with a level of complexity here. The idea of how
4091260	4097260	characters interrelate and the episodic arcs in A, B, C, D and E stories, it's this crazy wormhole
4097260	4102860	he's created. Portia de Rossi describes her experience filming saying, Look, I had a meltdown
4102860	4109020	absolutely. Then she laughs. I think all of us as actors had a moment where things came kind of
4109020	4114060	unglued for a second. At one point I remember I had all the episodes on the floor of my trailer
4114060	4119340	and they were all open to pages and I kind of went beautiful mind crazy trying to map everything out.
4119340	4125020	I had arrows and diagrams and it was so crazy and then I thought, Oh, I just have to let go
4125020	4131740	completely and show up to set and be present. As its May 26, 2013 premiere date approached,
4131740	4136380	it was clear that the season wasn't meant to be consumed the way the previous three had been.
4136380	4141580	It was meant to be watched repeatedly with jokes revealing themselves on rewatches and plot lines
4141580	4145660	intersecting in ways people weren't noticing the first time around. Ahead of the release,
4145660	4151260	Mitch Hurwitz offered some advice on watching the season. You can't take it all in at once.
4151260	4156060	It's like the selective attention test. It gives fans something to pour over if that's fun for them.
4156060	4160540	If they want to go right back and check out the Job episode and see how that was set up,
4160540	4165260	they can. Months ahead of the premiere, Netflix started a unique marketing campaign.
4165260	4169820	They began placing fake shows and movies on their platform inspired by previous episodes
4169820	4174620	of Arrested Development. There was also a contest for five fans with the most impressive creations
4174620	4179180	getting a chance to appear in a scene on the show. We also got a fun demo reel for Tobias
4179180	4190060	on his website, insertmeanywhere.biz. Netflix even held an orange carpet premiere
4190140	4193740	to celebrate the release, screening the first two episodes of the season.
4193740	4198380	Leading up to the release, there were a number of times and interviews that Mitch Hurwitz was
4198380	4203020	asked if he had any misgivings about the series potentially tarnishing the legacy of the original
4203020	4207260	three seasons he had created. At this point, Arrested Development had more or less been
4207260	4212300	branded an all-time classic. Hurwitz was always quick to reassure people that this season would
4212300	4217340	not disappoint, and one quote in particular makes it quite clear how the profile had not only grown
4217340	4222140	in the minds of the audience, but also in the mind of the show's creator, Hurwitz said.
4222140	4225820	If the first series aspired to be the godfather in terms of the family,
4225820	4230620	this thing aspires to be a godfather too. I'm sure a lot of people went to see the godfather
4230620	4235740	part two and said, what happens to the machine guns? What are we doing in Cuba? Meetings? Who
4235740	4240620	cares about meetings? But the godfather too was more substantial and rewatchable. It was more
4240620	4245260	complex. I aspire to do that kind of evolution with this. I don't mean to compare it to the
4245260	4249900	godfather 2, I just mean that, well, it's not exactly what the audience expects, but I think
4249900	4254940	it'll scratch the itch. Any comparison to the godfather, even one that was walked back,
4254940	4259660	can come across as a bit of a boast, but at the time, it seemed defensible.
4259660	4263340	Season 4 had some very heavy expectations on its shoulders.
4268620	4273020	Fourth season of Arrested Development is so densely layered that even writing about it is
4273020	4277900	a challenge. The first three seasons of the show had smaller story arcs that usually only ran for
4277900	4282380	about half a season, and the only long-term stories were either directly tied to the constant
4282380	4288220	perils of the Bluth Company or ongoing personal concerns like Tobias trying to find an acting job.
4288220	4292700	In other words, they were just reiterating the situation of this situation comedy.
4292700	4297180	Season 4 took things to a much grander scale, with the show's premise changing from a family
4297180	4301660	being held together to one that had been split apart. Each character had their own distinct
4301660	4306140	narrative, only occasionally intersecting with the other characters, and even though the episode
4306140	4312860	count was 15, the actual episodes ran considerably longer, ranging from 29 to 38 minutes. Its total
4312860	4318460	runtime is slightly longer than season 1's, even though that one ran for an additional 7 episodes.
4318460	4324300	Season 4 opens with a tease of where this story will take us, to a night called Cinco de Quatro,
4324300	4329660	originally created by the Bluths to undermine the Hispanic festival Cinco de Mayo, only to have
4329660	4334940	Cinco de Quatro claimed by that same community. And it's the sight of the murder of Lucille
4334940	4340140	Austero. To unravel how this all happened, the series goes back several years, picking up
4340140	4344540	immediately where season 3 left off, with the Bluths recovering at a Coast Guard headquarters
4344540	4349980	after having been rescued from sea when Lucille, fleeing the authorities, took the boat that most
4349980	4355340	of the family was on off course. Michael, having discovered at the end of season 3 that George
4355340	4360060	Sr. had stowed away on the boat he and George Michael were escaping on, also heads back to be
4360060	4365100	reunited with the family. The scene in the Coast Guard headquarters is one of the few that featured
4365100	4369900	all of the Bluth family in the same place at the same time, and it serves as a staging ground for
4369900	4374220	the stories to come. This scene is revisited multiple times throughout the season. Here's
4374220	4391660	how one moment is portrayed across several episodes. From this scene, each of the characters
4391660	4396700	goes off on their own adventures, rather than try to follow all the twists and turns of each of them,
4396700	4401500	and there are a lot. Instead, let's look at what it means for this family to fall apart.
4401500	4405740	One pattern among every member of the family is that their lives all start to break down
4405740	4410460	when they're separated, with no Michael or Bluth company holding them together. All the characters
4410460	4414940	almost immediately begin to self-destruct, even Michael's new development company quickly fails
4414940	4420140	and he's stuck living in George Michael's dorm until he's pathetically voted out. With his son
4420140	4424780	as the sole exception, Michael believes he'll be able to find a happier life for himself without
4424780	4430380	his family, and the other Bluths all believe the same thing. Tobias' story has him busking on the
4430380	4434940	street dressed up as The Thing from The Fantastic Four. This leads him to getting registered as a
4434940	4450940	sex offender when he pays a visit to Maybe. In Tobias' story, there's a genuinely sweet
4450940	4456620	moment between him and his new friend, Debris Bardot, played by Maria Bamford, a former actress
4456620	4473820	who is now in treatment for a chemical addiction. As the only outsider in the Bluth family,
4473820	4478060	Tobias is starving for positive support, the sort you might expect from a family,
4478060	4482700	but not if that family is the Bluths. It's a reminder of how non-typical this family is,
4482700	4487660	and Tobias being a part of it for over 20 years has borne the brunt of that reality.
4487660	4491980	Tobias spends much of his story assembling a new family, ostensibly to put on a production of a
4491980	4497420	Fantastic Four musical, but in reality he really loves being surrounded by a positive, caring group
4497420	4502700	of people who are willing to indulge his dream of becoming an actor. It still doesn't end well,
4502700	4507340	because Tobias is terrible at acting, but in spite of his loss of fortunes, he seems happier
4507340	4511820	struggling to get by with Debris than he ever did with Lindsay, who never appreciated his better
4511820	4515900	qualities. Lindsay's plotline is perhaps the most political the show has gotten up to this
4515900	4522780	point. She leaves Tobias for a young activist named Marky Bark, played by Chris Diamantopoulos.
4522780	4528700	Although things are nice at first, she eventually realizes that a life of a simple ostrich farmer
4528700	4534780	isn't for her. She eventually drops Marky to be with Herbert Love, played by Terry Crews. Perhaps
4534780	4539900	dating the show, Herbert is a reference to Herman Cain, who is running for the Republican nomination
4539900	4544860	in 2012, before dropping out after he was accused of sexually harassing multiple women.
4544860	4549340	Lindsay, charmed by his wealth, doesn't realize Herbert Love has hired her as an escort,
4549340	4553420	with payment going to maybe as her pimp. It would take too long to explain how that happens,
4553420	4557980	so let's keep moving. Jumping ahead to the conclusion, eventually Lindsay leaves Herbert,
4557980	4562220	only to end up replacing him on the campaign trail. After being robbed by someone she
4562300	4566300	thought was a Mexican man, Lindsay gives a speech that will sound very familiar.
4578140	4582060	This episode aired over two years before Donald Trump would announce his bid to become the
4582060	4586220	president, though the wall on the southern border had long been a talking point in right-wing
4586220	4592140	politics. Ironically, Lindsay was in some ways meant to model Hillary Clinton, as seen by the
4592140	4597660	distinct hairstyle she sports at the close of one episode. This storyline about building a wall on
4597660	4601020	the southern border ran through a number of characters' plotlines, but the connection
4601020	4606380	to Lindsay was particularly interesting as it spoke to the potential popularity of reactionary
4606380	4612220	politics. As parody, it seemed fitting, but in our current reality, it comes across as prophetic.
4612220	4617340	One thing season four simply can't escape is how utterly confusing it is. Although it somehow makes
4617340	4621500	sense when finished, the experience going through each episode can be frustrating,
4621580	4627180	particularly if it's your first time. Plot twists often get no explanation, jokes aren't paid off,
4627180	4632220	and it's easy to miss familiar faces that would take several episodes to reappear. It also didn't
4632220	4637100	help that each episode had such a lengthy runtime that even watching a single episode felt more
4637100	4641820	taxing than perhaps it should have. In an effort to explain the plot, episodes are packed with
4641820	4646940	flashbacks, flash-forwards, and heavy narration. Narration that gets disorienting when Ron Howard
4646940	4652060	himself shows up for a subplot involving Michael trying to sell his family's story to imagine
4652060	4657100	entertainment, only for Michael to imperil the deal when he mistakenly assumes his new girlfriend,
4657100	4662860	Rebel, played by Isla Fisher, is Ron Howard's mistress. The truth comes out in one of Tobias'
4662860	4672300	episodes. Did you not know that I'm Rebel's dad? I thought that you might also be her
4672300	4682460	a lover? I get it. I was arrested as a sex offender, but at least I knew it was my daughter
4682460	4688620	I was arrested for coming on too. The other guy Rebel is dating is George Maharis. Who was that?
4690460	4696940	No one. George Michael, looking for a new identity, is going by George Maharis now,
4696940	4701420	and Rebel was impressed by his software company that would hide your online footprint.
4701420	4706860	Fakeblock, which doesn't exist. At least not as a software company, it's actually just an app
4706860	4711500	that's a fake woodblock. I hope you can see how confusing this is all getting. The season's
4711500	4715820	fixation on individual characters does have some strength though. The plot lines dive deep into
4715820	4720060	who these characters are, and these include moments of realization for these characters,
4720060	4724620	occasionally summed up by other characters. You know, your whole life is an escape act,
4725340	4729580	and this girl seems like she really likes you. Why don't you just try to work it out and just stop
4729580	4737020	running? What you are is the invisible girl. You'll make it impossible for people to see
4737020	4743580	you in order to protect yourself. And that's when maybe who had spent so long lying to others,
4743580	4749900	and even herself, finally had to admit she had made a huge mis- I know I'm fine. Well,
4749900	4754140	not everyone has a moment of realization. There was also an intriguing plot line involving a
4754140	4758460	private investigator really emphasizing how the family was dissolving. Where the hell am I going
4758460	4767420	to find a PI? Jean Parmesan. At your service. AHH! Jean! He does this to me every time!
4767420	4771660	This guy gets me every time. The season does have a unique ending compared to every other
4771660	4776620	season of Arrested Development though. Michael, through some sly maneuvering, tries to get George
4776620	4781180	Michael out of Rebel's life without George Michael finding out they're dating the same woman.
4781180	4786060	And when the truth comes out, instead of closing with father and son somehow taking off from the
4786060	4798460	family once again as seen in previous seasons, this happens instead. And that's how the season
4798460	4804060	ends. With George Michael finally standing up to his father and, we hope, possibly breaking the
4804060	4810380	Bluth family cycle. By lying to his son and being even more like his father than he had been before,
4810380	4814780	Michael was setting up George Michael to be the same put-upon son that Michael was.
4814780	4819260	George Michael punching his father in the face is him rejecting that role for himself.
4819260	4823260	There are a few post-credits scenes with Buster being arrested for murdering Lucille too,
4823260	4827740	and Rod Howard excitedly talking about a movie based on him, but it would be some time before
4827740	4831660	those particular threads would be followed up on. The season ended as one of the most
4831660	4837420	densely structured seasons of a sitcom I have ever seen. Storylines layered on top of one another,
4837420	4842300	intersecting almost randomly, and a single joke could happen simultaneously across multiple
4842300	4847500	episodes. It was ambitious, uneven, and deeply polarizing. Even though Arrested Development
4847500	4852060	had returned, its fourth season wasn't the universal triumph the hype was demanding.
4854940	4859340	Netflix doesn't publish its viewing numbers, so we can't know for certain how well this season
4859340	4865500	performed. A third party that measured numbers at the time reported that 36% of devices connected
4865500	4870780	to Netflix on the Sunday premiere watched at least part of one episode of the series.
4870780	4874220	That's three times the number of people who watched House of Cards, which was one of the
4874220	4879580	strongest Netflix originals at the time. A few months after the show premiered, Netflix's chief
4879580	4884940	content officer, Ted Sarandos, apparently pleased with the show's performance, said that Arrested
4884940	4889420	Development would be returning to the streaming service at some point in the future. They just
4889420	4894220	weren't sure when or what form it would take. Mitch Hurwitz also discussed plans he had for
4894220	4899100	the series on Netflix, possibly airing material that had been filmed but not used in the fourth
4899100	4904700	season. He also described some kind of long-term plot for Tracy Bluth, Michael's deceased wife,
4904700	4910620	who very briefly appeared in season four on an old tape. She also looks like Isla Fisher, which
4910620	4916060	makes the whole relationship Rebel had with Michael and George Michael extra creepy. When
4916060	4920380	discussing the end of the season with George Michael punching his father, Hurwitz said in
4920380	4925100	an interview, What is the next step if you were to have that kind of situation with your father,
4925100	4930940	the closest person to you? What does happen next? As it turns out, I do have answers to that,
4930940	4935740	but I just need someone to let me make them. The original plan of doing a movie next was
4935740	4941100	still very much in Hurwitz's mind, though unlike the period after season three ended,
4941100	4946380	he said that there would be less teasing until plans were firmly in place and he had some idea
4946380	4951180	of a release date. Not all the reactions to the fourth season were quite so optimistic for the
4951180	4955900	future, though. In contrast to the overwhelmingly positive response of the original, the fourth
4955900	4961100	season proved to be more polarizing. Some felt it was too much of a departure from the original,
4961100	4965660	others appreciated its novel approach to storytelling. Regardless, the fact remains
4965660	4970700	that it was a divisive season. After season four aired, Mitch Hurwitz posted a handwritten note
4970700	4975580	to the show's Facebook page. It read in part, We are also grateful for another chance to bring
4975580	4980860	these characters to life and could not have done so without your consistent effort to
4980860	4986700	spread the word about it. Although obviously in the case of the enemies, the words you spread were
4986700	4989820	don't watch this show. You know, I probably shouldn't have even included them in the
4989820	4994780	salutation, but I'm writing this in ink plus making all sorts of mistakes. Did you notice the
4994780	4999340	S at the end of the word done? While it's obviously a bit tongue-in-cheek, it's clear
4999340	5003820	that Hurwitz was hearing a round of criticism about the fourth season, unlike the first three
5003820	5008700	seasons. In an interview several years later, Hurwitz reflected on some of the criticisms the
5008700	5014540	season got. It got positioned in the press saying, even Hurwitz thought it wasn't his best work.
5014540	5019340	Well, actually, I did think it was my best work, but I did acknowledge that it was and wasn't.
5020060	5024780	The other thing that was interesting about it is that some articles will say,
5024780	5031260	so-so reception, but it wasn't so-so. It was, this is great, or this is horrible. And even that
5031260	5035900	is what you hope for. I mean, you don't hope for this is horrible, but you do hope to do something
5035980	5040780	that's novel enough at a certain point in your career that people have strong reactions to it.
5040780	5045420	It's hard to map out the overall interest in a TV series over the span of years,
5045420	5050460	particularly when it isn't on the air and there are no ratings to consult. But as a show that
5050460	5055740	lived off the hype of the internet, interest in arrested development can be seen, at least in part,
5055740	5061260	on a Google Trends graph. Looking at how interest has changed since 2004, we can see it regularly
5061260	5066060	scoring above 10 for over a decade, shooting up slightly when news broke about its return at the
5066060	5072300	New Yorker festival reunion. Interest in the show exploded for its fourth season debut, but then
5072300	5077420	dropped entirely. What's most interesting, though, is that while previous years had the show scoring
5077420	5083020	a 10 on the interest scale, give or take one or two, after season four it was scoring either a six
5083020	5088460	or seven. That's a drop of roughly 40% of interest in the show. While it's probably the case that
5088460	5093580	stories about the rumored movie helped bolster interest earlier on, it's also true that, for
5093580	5098620	some fans, season four undercut a lot of their interest in this series. The late spike in the
5098620	5103260	interest chart does point to something else, though, and that's the show's eventual return for fifth
5103260	5109020	season on Netflix, split into two parts, each being eight episodes. In spite of the mixed response to
5109020	5113740	the fourth season, there was no hesitation on all the parties involved creatively to do more,
5113740	5118700	Hurwitz explained, saying, the studio wanted to do it, Netflix wanted to do it, the actors wanted
5118700	5123500	to do it, I wanted to do it, but we all have to want to do it at the same time. Ahead of the release
5123500	5128460	of the fifth season, we did get a second look at the fourth, though. On May 3rd, 2018, Netflix
5128460	5133980	released a re-edited version of the fourth season called, Fateful Consequences. This version of the
5133980	5139180	season would remix the series so that the story was told in a more chronological order. Instead
5139260	5143820	of focusing on a single character, episodes would include scenes from the stories of multiple
5143820	5149180	characters. So what was once an episode that only followed Job would be replaced by an episode that
5149180	5154940	followed Job, George Sr., and Buster. Episodes were also much shorter, being kept to a stricter 22
5154940	5159580	minute length. The season also ended up running for a few episodes longer because of that. A few
5159580	5164620	scenes were cut, including jokes that no longer made sense with the newly edited versions, and
5164620	5169260	a few were added in using additional audio that was recorded. It also introduced a lot more
5169260	5174060	narration to help fill in the blanks created when future events no longer had teases in earlier
5174060	5179580	episodes. There were aspects of this series that simply couldn't be changed, such as how few scenes
5179580	5183740	featured the Blue Family interacting with each other, and for jokes that fell flat the first time
5183740	5190060	around, they didn't really get better the second. The reaction to the remix was, well, mixed. Five
5190140	5194620	years after the original had aired, it found a loyal group of fans who enjoyed its structural
5194620	5199020	departure from the first three seasons, and there were fans of the early seasons who appreciated it
5199020	5203180	feeling more like those ones. If you're interested in watching the fourth season on Netflix,
5203180	5208140	it's the remixed version that's presented on its page for season four. To find the original
5208140	5213020	cut of the fourth season, you have to look under the trailers and more sections just to spot it.
5213020	5218060	While the original cut had five years for people to ponder its significance, the remix would not
5218060	5222940	have nearly as much time as only days after it was released, Netflix announced that the first
5222940	5228300	half of season five of Arrested Development would be aired a few weeks later, on May 29th,
5228300	5234300	2018. But there would be a few bumps on the way to that release. A few months before the release
5234300	5239900	of the fifth season, Jeffrey Tambor, who had been starring in the series Transparent, was fired
5239900	5244140	after he was alleged to have sexually harassed several women working on the production.
5244140	5248940	Afterwards, in an interview about the incident, Tambor admitted to having been difficult on the
5248940	5254140	set, though he insisted that he had not crossed the line into sexual harassment. When the news
5254140	5259020	broke, filming for the fifth season of Arrested Development had already been completed, and Tambor
5259020	5263420	was too integral to the series to be edited out, so it was never seriously considered to do that
5263420	5268460	season without him. In an interview, Mitch Hurwitz said, We were done shooting. There was no version
5268460	5273020	of cutting him out of the show, or there would be no show. Am I going to cut Jeffrey out of the show
5273020	5278220	based on allegations that he disputes, that Amazon hasn't shared, and that we have never experienced
5278220	5283100	any complaints about? No, of course I am not going to. I'm going to support Jeffrey.
5283100	5287740	Netflix head of content Ted Sarandos also expressed that Tambor had never been anything
5287740	5291900	but professional in their history working together. However, ahead of the premiere,
5291900	5296140	Jeffrey Tambor sat down for an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, where he mentioned that he had
5296140	5301100	a blow-up on the set of Arrested Development while filming its fifth season with Jessica Walter.
5301100	5306540	He added that he profusely apologized afterwards, but it raised a question that would come up in
5306540	5311740	several interviews with the press as the fifth season was being promoted, and most crucially,
5311740	5315900	in an interview with The New York Times. The interview included Jessica Walter,
5315900	5321340	Jeffrey Tambor, Jason Bateman, David Cross, Tony Ale, and Aliyah Shawkat. During the interview,
5321340	5325900	the subject came up of Jeffrey Tambor's behavior on the set of Arrested Development's fifth season.
5325900	5330380	Although Jessica Walter was the subject, Jason Bateman and David Cross talked over her,
5330380	5334940	coming to the defense of Tambor. It went on for a bit, until we finally got to hear
5334940	5338540	from Jessica Walter. Here's audio from that moment in the interview.
5360380	5369580	I have to let go of being angry at him. He never crossed the line on our show with any,
5369580	5376620	you know, sexual, whatever. Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize. I have to
5376620	5384300	let it go, and I have to give you a chance to, you know, for us to be friends again. But it's hard,
5384300	5389820	because honestly, Jason says this happens all the time. In like almost 60 years of working,
5389820	5395420	I've never had anybody yell at me like that on a set. And it's hard to deal with it, but I'm
5395420	5401660	over it now. I just let it go right here for The New York Times. She didn't give it up for anybody
5401660	5407500	else. Hearing the emotion in Jessica Walter's voice and just how extreme the harassment, and
5407500	5412620	as she plainly says, the worst she's experienced in her career, it does bring the incident into
5412620	5417580	perspective. And it's unfortunate that in that moment of the interview, Jason Bateman, David Cross,
5417580	5422460	and Tony Hale all had moments where they seemed more concerned about repairing Jeffrey Tambor's
5422460	5427980	reputation than giving Walter the space she needed to tell her story about what happened.
5427980	5432700	Although Walter herself was ready to move on, there was significant backlash to the interview.
5432700	5437740	Jason Bateman, David Cross, and Tony Hale all issued apologies. Bateman's apology on Twitter
5437740	5439580	was particularly frank, saying,
5439580	5443740	I was so eager to let Jeffrey know that he was supported in an attempt to learn, grow,
5443740	5448700	and apologize that I completely underestimated the feelings of the victim, another person I deeply
5448700	5452940	love. And she was sitting right there. I'm incredibly embarrassed and deeply sorry to have
5452940	5457900	done that to Jessica. This is a big learning moment for me. There's never any excuse for
5457900	5463420	abuse in any form from any gender, and the victim's voice needs to be heard and respected.
5463420	5467740	In response to a greater understanding of the incident, Hurwitz said in an interview,
5467740	5473180	I realize now I clearly misread the situation, given how Jessica has revealed she felt about it.
5473260	5478380	There was more to it than I realized, and it's not my place to opine about what I believe was the
5478380	5483100	weight of it. I misinterpreted what I understood to have played out, and more importantly, the depth
5483100	5488300	of Jessica's pain about it. I felt so bad about that. I feel bad because I love these people.
5488300	5492620	I feel bad for very personal reasons. And because I had been viewing this through the lens of a
5492620	5498380	family member who assumed that any discord, regardless of who was upset with who, existed
5498380	5502540	within the context of a family that cared about each other. And that was a mistake.
5502540	5506860	Of course we were at work, and we're not really related. That's why we have different last names,
5506860	5511980	and I wish I'd known or made a greater effort to know the pain it caused. Speaking to Vice a few
5511980	5516780	weeks later, Aaliyah Shawkat, the only person in the interview who seemed to intervene on behalf
5516780	5521180	of Jessica, offered more reflections on the incident. I looked at Jessica and I could see
5521180	5525820	how it was sitting with her, and it wasn't good. She comes in and she tries to speak for a little
5525820	5531340	while, and again they keep going. In that room, when I look back on it, I wish I was able to
5531340	5536780	gather myself to not be afraid to speak out war and realize that I wouldn't be hurting anybody,
5536780	5541580	but actually helping. I know I said a little, but what I wish I had said was,
5541580	5547980	stop talking, stop, Jessica, go on. There's a lot of men who have not been accused of anything that
5547980	5552700	haven't taken the time to think about this. What's more important to me is that these men,
5552700	5556620	whether they've been accused of anything or not, need to start looking at this movement and
5556620	5561580	realizing it has a lot to do with them. I hope that the guys on the show and now all these men
5561580	5566140	of all different ages start to communicate with the women in their lives, the women they work with,
5566140	5571820	and just ask openly with no shame, what can I do to be better? One response to the interview,
5571820	5577020	from Linda Holmes writing for NPR, cut to the heart of why this particular interview managed
5577020	5582300	to resonate so strongly. It's not the worst story, not by a mile. It may not even be Tambor's
5582300	5587420	worst story, but seeing a woman so brilliant withstand repeated efforts by people who say
5587420	5594060	they love her to recast her experiences as normal when she knew they were not, it was a lot to take.
5594060	5598940	It should also be mentioned that Jessica Walter never stepped forward with her story of her own
5598940	5604300	will. It was revealed by Jeffrey Tambor and she was then forced to comment on it directly herself.
5604300	5609260	Whether it was a positive story or not, it really is their own personal right to tell their story,
5609260	5613820	including whether or not they want to share it at all. The incidents regarding Tambor were not the
5613820	5618220	only popular subjects that came up during the press tour though. Many connections had been made
5618220	5622700	between the Blue family and the Trump family at the time. A group of immoral developers, one of
5622700	5627020	whom was running for office with a slogan about building a wall in the southern border, the
5627020	5631180	connection was pretty clear and the show wasn't going to pretend it didn't exist. This was also
5631180	5636060	seen as a way for bringing Arrested Development back to its roots, making it the way it once was.
5636060	5638460	In another interview Hurwitz elaborated saying,
5638460	5642620	nobody has quite dealt with the mess they've made. It makes me think of what was going on with
5642620	5647020	America. We're all growing. We're finally having an African-American president. We're finally
5647020	5651740	acknowledging transgender people and allowing gay marriage. And then it's like, no, let's pretend
5651740	5656220	none of that happened. Let's just go back to what it was. It's just easier. So that's a big
5656220	5662060	undercurrent in this. He laughs. Which is also funny because it's what the fans want. Just go back.
5662060	5667260	Make it great again. Make Arrested Greedy again. One other change that would face the fifth season
5667260	5672460	of Arrested Development was the absence of Portia de Rossi. In 2017, at her request,
5672460	5677660	she was written off the series scandal and had intended to step away from acting entirely to
5677660	5683020	focus on her new business, an art curation and publication company called General Public. However,
5683020	5688140	she did make an exception for Arrested Development. Although her appearance would be very limited,
5688140	5692540	only appearing in a handful of episodes, making her storyline of running for Congress far less
5692540	5697340	prominent than originally planned. The lead in to the fifth season didn't generate nearly as
5697340	5701340	much buzz as the fourth season. The atmosphere around the show was almost a night and day
5701340	5711340	difference heading into the fifth season premiere. Because of its connection to the previous season,
5711340	5716780	there are quite a few recaps in the early episodes of season five. The first episode opens with four
5716780	5721500	minutes worth of them. Although season five was an attempt to return Arrested Development to its
5721500	5726780	earlier formula, it did carry over the idea of a season-long narrative that season four used. The
5726780	5731500	first three seasons have arcs that lasted multiple episodes, but they were often discrete and not part
5731500	5735900	of a larger narrative that many of the arcs in season four and five were. It makes for a more
5735900	5741180	cohesive experience, though it does cost the show some of the manic energy of those earlier seasons.
5741180	5746540	The attempt to shift back to an earlier format and not being able to get there reflects a major theme
5746540	5751580	through the season, feelings of regret of trying to recapture the past. After being punched in the
5751580	5756780	face by his son, the dynamic between them now carries the implicit threat of violence.
5769660	5774540	The uniquely American character of the Bluths is reflected in George Michael's trip to Mexico,
5774540	5777500	made comfortable with how Americanized the country is.
5786380	5790620	To make it even more explicit, the show also makes direct references to the U.S. government.
5790620	5805420	The Obama call-out, at a time when the Trump administration was being criticized for its border
5805420	5810380	policy, is especially clever. It reveals how partisanship blinds people to the cruelty that
5810380	5816060	is consistent in American policies towards its southern border, regardless of the party and power.
5816060	5821260	One side may be worse, but neither is good. In that way, the show is critiquing the right-wing
5821260	5826300	shift in American politics and the response to it during the Trump years. Going back to the way
5826300	5831820	things were isn't enough of a correction. People need to demand genuine political change, or as seen
5831820	5836300	in the case of Maybee, take matters into their own hands the way she did and start helping out
5836300	5841660	directly. Not that Maybee really sticks with it. One thing that the show is very quick to remind
5841660	5846860	people of is that the Bluths will never be our saviors, even though they certainly project the
5846860	5859580	idea that they've grown. But their left-wing politics are entirely performative.
5871660	5878460	This is being used to criticize a narrative that was being built at the time. The Bluths
5878460	5883340	represent conservatives who were, supposedly, turning into liberals as a response to the
5883340	5888460	hard-right turn of the Republican Party. The show is revealing these people, like the Bluths,
5888460	5894140	to be grifters cynically using the Trump backlash liberals express to accrue power for themselves,
5894140	5898380	acting the part of a sensitive, caring family while literally building a wall on the southern
5898380	5903180	border. These are people who feed on the politics of hate. And to nail this point home, we see
5903180	5908700	Lindsay lean into the cruelty once Maybee, her campaign manager, realizes it plays well to a
5908700	5923820	certain part of the electorate. And just like that, the liberal posturing fades away when there's
5923820	5928460	an opportunity to seize real power. It isn't that the Bluths find someone like Donald Trump
5928460	5932940	objectionable. As former pals with the Bush administration, they just don't like the idea
5932940	5937660	of another odious person taking the party from them. This cynical form of politics, where people
5937660	5942140	are motivated to vote through hatred, either towards a group of people or a political candidate,
5942140	5947340	is highlighted when Debris, posing as Lindsay during a parade, wears a sheet because of her
5947340	5967100	anxiety. Arrested development is taking a very hard stance against the politics of hate,
5967100	5972540	and how it exists across the electoral spectrum. Rather than simply admonish the Bluths entirely,
5972860	5977260	the season does offer an interesting insight into why that family is so broken.
5977260	5981660	It's foreshadowed early on when Tobias has some surprisingly wise words for Lucille.
5994940	5999100	In the second half of the season, we go back in time to get an idea of where some of this hurt
5999100	6003900	comes from. We see the Bluths in their summer home, back when Job, Michael, Lindsay, and Buster
6003900	6020140	were all children. We also meet Grandma Mimi, played by Jean Smart, who reveals where Lucille
6020140	6032300	got her mean streak. The younger Lucille is played by Cobie Smulders. These scenes set in the past
6032300	6037580	unfolded the episode surrounding Buster's trial, as he's the top suspect in the murder of Lucille,
6037580	6047660	too. There's a subtle hint that the jury is turning against him. Luckily, one surprise witness
6047660	6065580	starts to turn the trial on its head. Jean's testimony did not help Buster. The trial also
6065580	6070700	reveals that the flashbacks we had seen in several episodes were actually a TV series being produced
6070700	6092220	by Ron Howard based on the life of Buster and the death of Mimi. Although things look grim for
6092220	6097180	Buster having been accused of murdering his grandmother and Lucille, too, Michael, fulfilling
6097180	6113020	his dream of being a lawyer, manages to turn the whole thing around. In this moment, Michael is
6113020	6118140	fulfilling his destiny of holding the Bluth family together, being the hero he always imagined himself
6118140	6137420	to be by revealing himself to be a murderer. Michael's idea of himself as a hero, coupled
6137420	6142780	with doing something monstrous, helps him reveal what it means to be a hero in the Bluth family,
6142780	6146620	and that can be extended to reframe his domineering parenting of George Michael as
6146620	6151580	monstrous as well. He treats his son the way his father treated him, thinking he was a hero
6151580	6157260	doing it the whole time. So while George Michael consistently resists his father, Michael tries to
6157260	6162540	hold his son even closer. George Michael struggles to create distance and hold on to his family
6162540	6167820	identity, wanting to stay connected in this relationship that's shaping him into someone
6167820	6169820	more like his father than he'd like to admit.
6176620	6186460	Michael and George Michael finally decide to settle things.
6197180	6202140	Except this is a scheme, too, because if there's one thing the Bluths excel at, it's scheming.
6207580	6221260	George Michael and Michael have learned to work together, not against one another,
6221260	6225740	and while that still takes the shape of being Bluths, screwing over some other people,
6225740	6229820	they seem to have made it work well enough that at least they aren't hurting each other,
6229820	6235100	and maybe by trusting each other they can start to rebuild their lives into something better.
6235100	6239820	And in the finale we find out the truth about Lindsay's parents. She's actually Lucille's
6239820	6259100	half-sister. And as it looks like the family is coming together, Michael and George Michael do
6259100	6263420	what they do best, and that's take-off. And it wasn't Michael that killed Lucille, too. That
6263420	6274460	was Buster. And that's how season 5 came to an end. Plotlines colliding, traditions being
6274460	6279260	upheld, and a stark reminder that the Bluths are everything that's bad with America. We don't get
6279260	6284540	a tease for the next season, there is no epilogue, and there are no other signs we might see the
6284540	6290780	Bluths once again in the future. Just a stair car exiting stage left, leaving Sudden Valley,
6290780	6300860	perhaps forever. The fifth season of Arrested Development did not receive nearly as much
6300860	6306860	attention as the fourth, and was similarly not as passionately hated or appreciated. Although the
6306860	6311260	interview in the New York Times got a lot of attention, that didn't translate to people
6311260	6316460	talking about the show's return very much. The content of the show didn't do much to help,
6316460	6321980	while it may not have been bad, and in some ways it was pretty good. It was clear that the show
6321980	6325900	wasn't going to have the impact it once did, and while it was clever to weave that into the
6325900	6331260	narrative, it may not have come together as well as had been intended. In the third episode of the
6331260	6335500	fifth season, there's a reference to a very old internet meme, the Star Wars Kid.
6336380	6348060	This was referenced in the original run of Arrested Development, as well as the season
6348060	6354460	for revival. Not only is this joke now 16 years old being an internet meme, it feels even more
6354460	6360140	dated. Arrested Development is similarly starting to feel tired. While I appreciate a long-running
6360140	6365820	gag as much as anyone, even Jean Parmesan, not every joke is built to last, and comedy is
6365820	6371500	infamous for aging poorly. The Star Wars Kid joke, for example, is not just an early meme,
6371500	6376380	but one of the first major incidents of a teen being bullied by the internet. The poor kid's
6376380	6381180	life got turned upside down because a video that was posted by someone else made him a laughing
6381180	6385900	stock. While in some ways the series was fairly good about growing over time and discarding some
6385980	6391020	of its more controversial material, there were still moments like this that really made the show
6391020	6396860	feel trapped in the past, and all for preserving a cruel joke that was long past its expiration
6396860	6401580	date. More than a stale joke, the series itself felt like it was treading water. The Bluths are
6401580	6406620	terrible people, and it's an intergenerational phenomena that can be extrapolated to the American
6406620	6412300	experience. Lovely, but does it need to return every five years to deliver that message again?
6412300	6417180	The fifth season is, of course, not irredeemable. The political commentary was sharp, the Michael
6417180	6421820	and George Michael story did take some interesting steps forward, and there were some genuine laughs
6421820	6426780	to be had. But as a show, it struggled to capture anyone's attention, as can be seen in much of the
6426780	6431740	audience's reaction. In an article for The Verge, Keith Phipps summed it up nicely, saying,
6431740	6436860	Arrested Development was once a special show, now it's a show struggling to remind viewers why
6436940	6442540	it's special. This raises the important question, is this the end for Arrested Development? In an
6442540	6448060	interview, Mitch Hurwitz expressed a desire to do more. Here's an excerpt from a 2018 article.
6448060	6453340	It flows so easily out of this cast. It's hard not to want to do more. It may be another epic
6453340	6458540	way. We've always been underdogs, he says. Nobody ever got cocky. Really, we're all still
6458540	6464140	trust-trying so hard. So actually, the every few years thing works great for me, because it's hard
6464140	6469660	to get a laugh through to that screen. The cast was less committed, though Will Arnett offered an
6469660	6479340	interesting perspective, saying, Mitch has written out versions where each one of us is the last
6479340	6483660	person, depending on who lasted the longest. And I predict it will be me. Yeah, I'm gonna
6483660	6488620	outlive everyone. David Cross, speaking on a podcast, seemed less convinced that the show
6488620	6493180	would ever return. In particular, he cited the challenging work schedule and the hardship of it
6493180	6498060	on the cast. Now, you can definitively say it's over. It's over. How do you know that?
6498060	6507900	I know. Yeah, we didn't have full scripts. It was a terrible way for actors to try to do what they
6507900	6514380	do. And there were a lot of frustrations early on. The shoot kept extending. You're asking a
6514380	6520300	lot of people, and especially older people, who just don't have the physical stamina that some
6520300	6528140	younger cast and crew do. And it led to some tensions, and it was a very bad way to
6528780	6533980	work. David Cross also said he believed the show was over back in 2010, though clearly,
6533980	6539500	Fate had other plans for the show. Sadly, this time it seems like Fate took another turn,
6539500	6544940	and it's unlikely that Arrested Development will return, or at least, it can never be the same show
6544940	6553580	again. Jason Bateman's career trajectory changed completely after Arrested Development ended its
6553580	6558860	third season. He went from appearing in sitcom pilots destined to fail to appearing in big-budget
6558860	6564940	movies such as Horrible Bosses, Hancock, and Zootopia. Most notably, he starred in and directed
6564940	6571740	several episodes of the Netflix series Ozark. Will Arnett's career experienced a big boost
6571740	6576780	after appearing on the show, going on to appear in movies and TV shows, though perhaps it's voice
6576780	6581980	work that's given him the most acclaim, having starred in Bojack Horseman and portrayed Lego
6581980	6587420	Batman in multiple Lego movies. Portia de Rossi would go on to appear on the shows Better Off
6587420	6592620	Ted, Niptuck, and Scandal, though as mentioned earlier, she would leave acting in 2018 and is
6592620	6598140	now currently focusing on her new business venture, General Public. Michael Cera starred in the movies
6598140	6603580	Superbad, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Juno, and a host of other projects that needed an awkward
6603580	6608860	teen boy. In many ways, his style of teenage boy became a trend in the 2000s. Most recently,
6608860	6614300	he voiced Hank in the movie Paws of Fury, The Legend of Hank. Aaliyah Shawkat has been very
6614300	6618860	prolific since Arrested Development gave her career its first big break. She's appeared
6618860	6623900	in dozens of TV shows and movies, most recently starring in the series Search Party, which ended
6623900	6629580	its fifth season in early 2022. Tony Hale would appear in a number of projects after Arrested
6629580	6634140	Development changed his career, including a lengthy run on the series Veep. Most recently,
6634140	6639420	he's appeared in Hocus Pocus 2 and done voice work for the Harley Quinn TV series. Jeffrey
6639420	6644700	Tambor's career has come to a halt after he was fired from Transparent for allegedly sexually
6644700	6650060	harassing several of the women who worked on the production. Jessica Walter would take on another
6650060	6655500	Lucille Bluth-esque role as Mallory Archer on the show Archer. In interviews promoting the
6655500	6660220	fifth season of Arrested Development, when asked if she would return to the show, she believed that
6660220	6665660	within five years she would be too old to keep acting. Sadly, she would only be around for
6665660	6672860	another three. She plastered away in her sleep on March 24, 2021. Classic is a term that's given
6672860	6678860	to a work of art that either has or is expected to pass the test of time. Remembered well after
6678860	6684060	its debut and often outliving the artist or artists who created it. Arrested Development
6684060	6688700	had the immense advantage of achieving a cult's status amongst a passionate viewership and critics
6688700	6694380	with its first three seasons. In 2012, its position as a classic might have been guaranteed,
6694380	6700460	depending on who you asked, but its divisive return in 2013 and its less-noticed return in 2018
6700460	6706300	have complicated that confidence in its classic status. Art isn't created in a vacuum, and it's
6706300	6711580	through influencing new art that older works are often remembered, and by being remembered,
6711580	6716540	become more likely to be thought of as a classic. So in that sense, those are the viewers who may
6716540	6721580	matter the most. Arrested Development will be remembered as a great work of art by being
6721580	6725580	remembered by artists who will go on to create great works of art of their own,
6725580	6732140	creating a vast tapestry of classic television. Arrested Development may or may not be over,
6732140	6736860	or at the very least, if it comes back, it certainly can't be the same without Jessica
6736860	6742060	Walter. But its status as a classic doesn't seem to be under a serious threat. It may speak to the
6742060	6746060	strength of the original three seasons, but perhaps more importantly, it speaks to the
6746060	6750220	strength of the memory of those seasons in the minds that made the show a classic.
6751500	6757820	Can you tell that this video took nearly seven hours to record? Yeah, it's one of my longest ever,
6757820	6764620	and it was a challenge writing something this big for a show that didn't even last 100 episodes.
6764620	6770060	All of this coming together in one big package. I really hope it is good and people enjoyed it.
6770060	6773180	If you are someone who enjoyed it and you're thinking, I'd like to see more of those,
6773180	6776220	well, I've got a bunch of other TV show retrospectives you can check out,
6776220	6781020	and you can also make sure I keep making more in the future by supporting this channel financially.
6781020	6785660	You can become a patron or a member, and you'll get your name floating up the screen, like all
6785660	6790700	these lovely people here. In addition to that, you'll get early access to new videos as I make
6790700	6795580	them, plus other fun extras that I throw in every now and again. If you would like to support the
6795580	6800940	channel in a non-monetary fashion though, you can do that by liking, commenting, and subscribing if
6800940	6805340	you haven't already, and do hit the bell for notifications. I want to thank everyone so much
6805340	6811180	for watching all the way until the end, and this was a real challenge to narrate, and I
6811180	6814300	want to ask Ron Howard, how do you think I did?
6814300	6816540	Real shoddy narrating, just pure crap.
6817580	6818940	F*** you, Ron.
