0	3360	My sponsor for this video is not Gillette and their razors suck.
10960	14320	In January of 2019, Gillette released an ad titled,
14320	21120	We Believe The Best Men Can Be Gillette short film about the danger of toxic masculinity.
21120	23120	And to sell razors, of course.
23120	28640	In some corners of the internet, this was taken as a direct assault on men and masculinity,
28640	32320	and the outrage helped fuel this ad to reach millions of viewers.
32320	37280	The story of using socially progressive messaging in advertising has already been told in a great
37280	41760	video by Hbomberguy. You can go watch that if you want a bit more detail on how these companies
41760	46160	use these methods to sell their products. This video isn't about that, though. It's about what
46160	52960	happened with the Gillette outrage a few months later. In July of 2019, Procter & Gamble, Gillette's
52960	57040	parent company, announced in its fourth quarter earnings report that it was writing down the
57040	63200	value of its Gillette assets by $8 billion. The reaction from the outrage mob was predictable,
63200	67440	lots of crowing and patting themselves on the back, and people were hurriedly adding
67440	72640	yet another entry to the spurious list of things that went woke and got broke.
72640	77680	Which is still ridiculous, because this write-down has nothing to do with the ad in question.
77680	81760	One of the common misconceptions about this $8 billion loss is that it reflects a dramatic
81760	86640	drop in sales of Gillette products. A quick look at the sales figures tells us this is impossible.
86640	91360	Gillette is part of Procter & Gamble's grooming division, a division that, in all of its 2019
91360	98320	fiscal year, had sales of $6.2 billion, roughly a 5% drop from last year's $6.6 billion. So,
98320	102880	obviously, that's not a drop of $8 billion. And even though the ad came out in January,
102880	108800	Procter & Gamble's fiscal year actually ends in June, so it would only have about five months of
108800	115040	sales to lose $8 billion. This write-down wasn't about millions of people leaving the Gillette brand
115040	119760	en masse. Unlike certain critics, let's actually read the whole article to get a better understanding
119760	124880	of what happened here. It quite clearly calls this $8 billion write-down. This is when a company
124880	129840	looks at the assets it has and lowers their value based on demand in the market. Here's a small
129840	136000	example to explain that. Let's say we have a piece of clothing such as jorts, and you're a company
136000	140640	that has a warehouse full of jorts in the midst of a jorts craze sweeping the world. You would
140640	145440	record that stash of jorts as an asset in your books, and you'd value it based on the high price
145440	151600	people are currently paying for jorts. As time goes by, humanity comes to its senses and realizes
151600	156880	that jorts are, in fact, ugly clothing no sane person would wear. As demand goes down, the average
156880	161120	price for jorts goes down with it, and that warehouse full of jorts you have is now worth
161120	166640	substantially less. While the physical asset of jorts remains completely unchanged throughout
166640	171200	this time period, their value in the marketplace has gone down, and a responsible company would
171200	175920	need to update this value in its books by writing it down. And we're seeing something similar happen
175920	181680	here with razors. Although razor technology hasn't changed dramatically, it's men's fashion that has
181680	186400	been changing over the last decade, and beards are very fashionable these days. Less guys shaving
186400	191520	means less guys are buying razors. There's also the fact that the population, at least in the
191520	196320	United States, and older men generally don't shave themselves as frequently as younger men.
196320	200480	Add into the fact that Gillette, which once had very little in the way of competition, is now
200480	204880	facing some serious resistance from companies like Harry's and Dollar Shave Club. Suddenly,
204880	208720	you've got a brand that's having a much tougher time sell in its products, and Gillette's sales
208720	213440	over the past decade reflect that, showing a steady decline in year-over-year sales. Proctor
213440	217680	and Gamble also reported that its global sales are less profitable due to currency fluctuations
217680	222800	around the world. That's a whole other topic in finance that I'm even less qualified to speak about.
223280	227600	The point is that Gillette's trouble as a brand had been well known for some time. Here's an article
227600	233280	from back in 2017 demonstrating that Gillette as a brand was having a tough time. Let's keep one
233280	237840	thing straight though. Gillette still has a massive mortgage share. There are a lot of different
237840	243360	estimates of this, but I've seen numbers from everywhere between 50 to 60%, but that's a far
243360	249360	cry from the 70% at once claim. It means that this incredibly profitable business is now only
249360	253600	fairly profitable. It stands to reason that a brand that doesn't make as much money as it used
253600	258400	to isn't going to be worth as much in the marketplace. Proctor and Gamble purchased Gillette
258400	265600	in 2005 for the enormous sum of $57 billion, and while Gillette showed strong growth in the years
265600	271600	that followed, in the early 2010s it demonstrated a sizable decline, meaning if Proctor and Gamble
271600	276160	were to try and sell Gillette on the market today, it's quite likely it wouldn't fetch quite as high
276160	281040	a price. A write-down is an accounting technique used to reflect this new reality. It also lets
281040	285760	the parent company, in this case Proctor and Gamble, lower its tax burden. If it's reporting
285760	290400	to its government that its assets are worth $8 billion less than previously reported, that's
290400	294720	$8 billion they won't have to pay taxes on at the end of the year. The annual earnings report this
294720	299840	was all announced and also announced very strong sales and overall growth for the Proctor and Gamble
299840	304640	company. So when this news went public, the market, being aware of how all this works,
304640	309280	wasn't dissuaded by the write-down and instead focused on the strong sales growth, decided to
309280	314720	buy up shares of Proctor and Gamble and sent the stock to a record high. This, obviously, flies in
314720	319360	the face of the idea that a commercial about toxic masculinity ruined Gillette and cost them
319360	324320	$8 billion. Not that right-wing media outlets let it stop them from running countless stories about
324320	329920	just that. My absolute favorite comes from the Washington Examiner, which originally ran an
329920	336880	article with a headline reading, Gillette CEO, $8 billion loss is price worth pain over hashtag
336880	343040	me too campaign, which would later be updated with this correction. Correction. The Washington
343040	347680	Examiner has updated the story to remove the suggestion that Gillette lost $8 billion due to
347680	352480	its me too inspired advertising campaign. We regret that this article did not adhere to the
352480	357280	Washington Examiner's normal standards and procedures and the headline had to be changed to
357280	364240	Gillette CEO losing customers over hashtag me too campaign is price worth pain. How many customers
364240	369680	were lost? Did it have a meaningful impact? This article can't really tell us and that's kind of
369680	376000	the point. It's just a bunch of noise. But did this ad actually have an impact? I want to look
376000	381040	at the sales numbers one more time. In this annual data, we can see sales for Gillette have been going
381040	385440	down for a long time. The last eight years in particular have not been kinds of the brand.
385440	391680	And when did this commercial debut? Right about here. When trying to measure the value of the
391680	396240	Gillette brand and its associated assets, one of the key metrics is going to be how much it earns
396240	400960	via sales. And if poor sales are responsible for lowering its value, this has been a problem long
400960	405920	before the ad about toxic masculinity. You could argue that unlike Nike, this ad didn't do much
405920	411040	to help Gillette. And that seems like a fair assessment. It's not like this ad and the media
411040	415120	storm that followed really turned the brand's fortunes around. There's all sorts of reasons
415120	418800	why this could be true. People are probably more likely to make a political statement through
418800	422960	their fashion choices rather than through whatever grooming products they have in their washroom.
422960	427440	But the argument that being woke destroyed Gillette's business, especially when it still
427440	431840	makes over six billion dollars a year, isn't anywhere close to true. And with that, we can
431840	436720	put this story to bed. Another bad argument in the long line of trash fire arguments about
436720	442960	getting woke and going broke. So why the hell am I talking about a story that's nearly a year old?
443520	449280	One of my most downvoted videos is why get woke, go broke is a lie. While I'd like to think it's
449280	454400	because the title should obviously have been get woke, go broke is a joke, the truth is,
454400	460080	according to the comments, that I was avoiding the much stronger examples of how inserting woke
460080	466080	politics into anything turns off a mainstream audience. Chief among those examples is the Gillette
466080	470560	eight billion dollar loss, which dribbles into the comments section of that video on a regular
470560	475360	basis. I always found it strange that I kept seeing these comments and obviously false story
475360	480400	about a single ad costing a company eight billion dollars should make someone skeptical or at least
480400	485120	raise some alarms. That's obviously a sensational story. Even if you're someone inclined to believe
485120	490160	the whole get woke, go broke thing, this should still make you pause. Doesn't it seem a little
490160	495520	far fetched? I think what we need to consider is that when people spread this talking point,
495520	499440	they aren't trying to demonstrate their knowledge of a subject, but rather their membership in a
499440	504960	group. In recent years, psychologists have been anxiously studying the expansion of fake news
504960	509760	ever since social media started becoming such a pervasive spreader of it. Recent research shows
509760	514480	us quite depressingly that false news not only spreads widely on the internet, it also spreads
514480	519360	much quicker than real news. This is especially true for anything considered political. According
519360	524240	to a review of the research published by the American Psychological Association, facts tend
524240	528240	to be spread by partisans on the left and the right at the same rate, regardless of whether or
528240	532720	not that information is true. Part of the reason this information is spread on social media
532720	537440	is not the desire to inform our contemporaries, but to signal that we are, in fact, part of the
537440	542560	same political group. Daniel Kahane, a professor of law and psychology at Yale Law School, offers
542560	547280	some insight using the politically contentious topic of climate change. If you take an ordinary
547280	552080	member of the public, his or her carbon footprint is too small to make an effect on climate change.
552080	556800	If they make a mistake on the science in that part of their life, nothing bad happens to them,
556800	561360	but they can be adversely affected if they're holding a deviant view on an identity-defining
561360	566720	issue inside their social group. In other words, when someone shows up to my comments section to
566720	570880	mention a talking point that never had any way behind it, they aren't honestly hoping to change
570880	575360	my mind. They're just letting me and any other commenters know that they belong to a certain
575360	580880	political group, one that opposes the group I represent. And when watching some of the videos
580880	585360	on YouTube pushing narratives like Get Woke Go Broke that have a tenuous connection to any sort
585360	589760	of evidence, you can see how they're constructed not to provide greater context or understanding,
589760	594160	but instead taking a news story and placing it into a more exciting narrative,
594160	598400	one that binds its audience together. They're going there to have their opinions reinforced,
598400	602880	and to see other people in the comments section or on Twitter who feel the exact same way that
602880	606640	they do. They may go on to other social media platforms where they continue to signal to one
606640	610880	another that they're in the same social circle. No one really understands anything that they're
610880	616240	talking about, but they've at least identified their compatriots, their friends, their community.
616240	620000	And that's what this is all about. It's about building communities and making friends. And on
620000	624240	its face, that's a lovely thing. Making friends and building a community is something everyone
624240	629360	wants and I generally recommend. But where it goes wrong is when it's centered around blindly
629360	634080	following someone who's deeply ignorant of politics, or worse yet, misrepresenting the
634080	638880	news of the day to advance a toxic political agenda. Some of the most successful YouTube
638880	643520	and Twitch channels are built on this idea of community, and some creators use that language
643520	648160	quite openly. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but what I would hope that you as a viewer
648160	652640	do is take some time to consider what positions are required to be a member of that community
652640	657120	and what cost is associated with ignoring them. And then ask yourself, have I really thought about
657120	661920	this? Have I spent the time really digging into and trying to understand these issues that are
661920	667920	apparently central to my social circle that I'm now a part of? And that's true of commentary
668000	672160	channels on the right and left. A recent piece of research to come out of the University of
672160	677200	Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada argued that it isn't political affiliation alone that's to blame
677200	681280	for the spread of fake news on the internet. Researchers argue that it's actually a case of
681280	685520	lazy thinking, and that when people think more critically about the news they're seeing,
685520	690720	they're less likely to engage with the spread of fake news, regardless of the political affiliation.
690720	697120	David Rand, PhD, Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, explains.
697200	701920	Our findings suggest that getting people to reason more is a good thing. When you're on social media,
701920	707280	stop and think. So the next time you're on social media and you see a sensational news story,
707280	711120	especially when you're inclined to agree with, take some time to think about it before rushing
711120	715120	to share it with your friends. It's probably too much to expect this one video to change someone's
715120	719200	deeply held political beliefs, but I hope anyone watching will at least be less willing to spread
719200	723680	bogus news stories in an effort to take the other side down a peg. And when it comes to your own
723680	729360	personal beliefs and the arguments that sustain them, never be afraid of an honest challenge or
729360	734240	conversation or debate. At the end of the day, you'll either make your existing beliefs stronger
734240	738640	or you'll be able to adopt something that's better and more accurately reflects the truth.
738640	742080	And if you're in one of those communities where you have to believe something that's either
742080	748080	obviously not true or can only be believed if you refuse to actually engage with evidence or facts,
748080	750800	maybe consider that this group isn't the one for you.
750800	757040	For the longest time, I've been meaning to make a video about how to disagree
757040	763120	amongst our own side, that is to say, within the left. I'm a very big believer that debate
763120	768720	and conversation, and when I say debate, I don't necessarily mean live debates, which
768720	772320	often feel more like theater than anything else. Not that there's anything wrong with theater,
772320	776640	of course. Theater is a lovely and sometimes necessary thing. But I think it's very important
776640	781840	that we create a space where we feel free to debate and discuss our ideas in a way to make
781840	786480	them better, stronger and more resistant to challenge from parties who we may find ourselves
786480	792480	at odds with politically. Sometimes that means ideas we have aren't great. They need to grow,
792480	797280	evolve, or sometimes they need to be dropped entirely depending on the arguments involved.
797280	800960	Sometimes we might need to bring them back if there's some new argument is brought for them.
800960	806000	That's one of the lovely things about discussion and discourse. And when I say debate, I'm talking
806000	812400	about real issues, not stuff like let's talk about, like climate change, as if that's not
812400	816800	an obvious scientific reality. This video initially wasn't supposed to be about any of that,
816800	820720	but the Gillette thing, it just really bugged me and I wanted to talk about it. Not because I
820720	825360	care about Proctor and Gamble and Gillette. I actually don't like them at all. I don't use
825360	830560	the razors usually. And I think they're pretty bad and overpriced. If you take anything away
830560	835520	from the Gillette section of this video, it's just don't buy their products or do. I don't care.
