00:00.000 --> 00:14.320
The Overton Window is what happens when you cross a bland political thriller with the

00:14.320 --> 00:16.840
ravings of a conspiracy theorist.

00:16.840 --> 00:19.720
It's cynical, lazy, and a complete waste of time.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.720
It's also a complete grift.

00:21.720 --> 00:25.440
It probably won't convince anyone new with its paranoid premise, but it does comfortably

00:25.440 --> 00:30.480
remind believers that, yes, their country can only be saved by their love of America

00:30.480 --> 00:32.120
and guns.

00:32.120 --> 00:36.280
To understand this book, we have to go back to when it was published, 2010, and remind

00:36.280 --> 00:40.040
ourselves of the phenomena that was Glenn Beck.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.280
Glenn Beck really used to be somebody.

00:42.280 --> 00:45.920
He still technically is, but back then he was a really big deal.

00:45.920 --> 00:51.520
A former radio personality, Glenn Beck's start in the cable TV news world was in 2006

00:51.520 --> 00:54.280
on CNN's Headline News Channel.

00:54.280 --> 00:59.200
By 2008 he had made the jump to Fox News, and within a few years he had become one of

00:59.200 --> 01:01.600
the hottest shows on cable news.

01:01.600 --> 01:06.280
He had several best-selling books to his name, and he was the spiritual leader of the new

01:06.280 --> 01:08.520
Tea Party movement.

01:08.520 --> 01:12.960
Glenn Beck's specialty was reciting facts, drawing lines, connecting them on a chalkboard,

01:12.960 --> 01:16.840
and expressing deep concern that these things might be connected.

01:16.840 --> 01:21.280
Glenn's rants were filled with things the right hates and fears, randomly bundled together

01:21.280 --> 01:23.840
in an hour of rage and tears.

01:23.840 --> 01:38.480
And I do mean literal tears.

01:38.480 --> 01:42.880
And I don't bring this up to mock Glenn, there's actually nothing wrong with a grown man crying.

01:42.880 --> 01:45.780
Instead I'm going to use this to illustrate what he does with these tears.

01:45.780 --> 01:50.760
He sells emotions hard, and his generally pleasant demeanor makes him easy to empathize

01:50.760 --> 01:51.760
with.

01:51.760 --> 01:56.040
And once you start empathizing with this sad crying man, you're ready to turn on those

01:56.040 --> 01:58.280
mean things that made him cry.

01:58.280 --> 02:00.440
And what are those mean things?

02:00.440 --> 02:02.120
This image sums it up nicely.

02:02.120 --> 02:05.280
There's something about the expression on Glenn's face here.

02:05.280 --> 02:09.040
He has pictures of various people underneath the watchful gaze of Chairman Mao, and he

02:09.040 --> 02:13.560
looks at us in confusion-ness if to say, what aren't you people getting about how obvious

02:13.560 --> 02:14.560
this is?

02:14.560 --> 02:18.200
It's something that seems silly if it's just thrown out at you in a random video like

02:18.200 --> 02:22.040
this one, but if you'd just been having a cry with this guy, you'd be far more sympathetic

02:22.040 --> 02:26.680
to this bizarre image and you might actually sit down and listen to his ravines and might

02:26.680 --> 02:28.600
even give it some credence.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.560
He's using those emotions as a way of manipulating you.

02:31.560 --> 02:37.000
He also had this thing where he kept calling everything a Nazi, particularly if they were

02:37.000 --> 03:06.840
working for the Obama administration.

03:07.000 --> 03:14.240
The content of Glenn Beck's rantings, or as much content as could be found, was about

03:14.240 --> 03:19.400
an impending doom brought on by the out-of-control spending of the Obama administration.

03:19.400 --> 03:23.960
The debt would, according to Beck, herald the end of the country and the collapse of

03:23.960 --> 03:25.920
American life as we know it.

03:25.920 --> 03:29.360
So he sounded off every night to his loyal followers, becoming a major figure in the

03:29.360 --> 03:30.800
Tea Party movement.

03:30.800 --> 03:36.400
The Tea Party movement was ostensibly a group of concerned American citizens who were very

03:36.400 --> 03:41.640
much bothered by the increasing debt and out-of-control spending of the US government.

03:41.640 --> 03:45.100
We sometimes forget about the Tea Party, but 10 years ago they were responsible for a major

03:45.100 --> 03:49.120
shift to the right in the Republican Party, a shift that we're still feeling today, a

03:49.120 --> 03:53.440
shift that's included more tax cuts for the wealthy, cuts to welfare programs, and a general

03:53.440 --> 03:57.680
hostility to even the mildest forms of expanding the social safety net.

03:57.680 --> 04:01.840
Glenn Beck was deeply connected to this audience, the same audience that would sneer at the

04:01.840 --> 04:06.040
Republican establishment, ignore the criticisms of the mainstream media, and embraced a conman

04:06.040 --> 04:09.640
posing as an outsider promising to tear down the system.

04:09.640 --> 04:14.100
It would be unfair to say this all started 10 years ago exactly, but in this book, The

04:14.100 --> 04:18.360
Overton Window, we have a wonderful symbol of the right-wing populism that was becoming

04:18.360 --> 04:22.280
more mainstream back in 2010.

04:22.280 --> 04:26.960
This novel takes its title from the concept of the Overton Window, created by Joseph P.

04:26.960 --> 04:27.960
Overton.

04:27.960 --> 04:32.600
The window describes a range of acceptable political thought within society at any given

04:32.600 --> 04:33.600
time.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.840
It's tied along a number of different dimensions, like the scope of left and right-wing politics,

04:37.840 --> 04:43.480
but Glenn Beck prefers its original definition, describing the range of freedom within a society.

04:43.480 --> 04:48.480
This book was preceded by a ridiculous trailer that uses the lines from a Rudyard Kipling

04:48.480 --> 04:52.280
poem titled The Gods of the Copybook Headings.

04:52.280 --> 04:56.960
The poem is referenced several times throughout the novel, and has a degree of thematic resonance

04:56.960 --> 04:57.960
within it.

04:57.960 --> 05:04.400
As surely as fire will burn, the gods of the copybook headings, with terror and slaughter

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
return.

05:05.400 --> 05:09.000
The Overton Window.

05:09.000 --> 05:10.920
That trailer is just… wow.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.960
I've never seen a book trailer quite like that one.

05:13.960 --> 05:17.400
To be honest though, I don't see many trailers for books at all.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.160
Before we dive into the narrative though, there are two things we need to look at.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.660
First, this cover.

05:21.660 --> 05:25.580
At first glance, the image of the Statue of Liberty looking towards the horizon seems

05:25.580 --> 05:29.640
bland and uninspired, but if we zoom in on the statue's body you can tell it's much

05:29.640 --> 05:33.620
more jacked than the original, and you can even see a bit of a beard as the statue very

05:33.620 --> 05:36.180
politely turns their head back towards us.

05:36.180 --> 05:40.380
For some reason, the Statue of Liberty is a man, and he's holding some kind of weapon,

05:40.380 --> 05:43.540
I think, instead of the usual stone tablets.

05:43.540 --> 05:46.180
This wasn't the only cover that was being considered.

05:46.180 --> 05:50.380
Glenn posted a number of options on his website, and held a poll to pick out the winner.

05:50.380 --> 05:54.940
The cover chosen came in fourth… out of four.

05:54.940 --> 05:58.500
Inside the book itself, we get a little note from the author before the narrative starts,

05:58.500 --> 06:02.500
and oh boy, does the opening paragraphs at the stage for what's wrong with this book.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.340
I'm going to channel my inner Glenn Beck here.

06:05.340 --> 06:08.380
I've been a fan of thrillers for many years.

06:08.380 --> 06:13.500
While non-fiction books aim to enlighten the goal of most thrillers is to entertain.

06:13.500 --> 06:17.800
But there is a category of novels that do both… faction.

06:17.800 --> 06:21.960
Completely fictional books with plots rooted in fact, and that is the category I strive

06:21.960 --> 06:24.600
for with the Overton Window.

06:24.600 --> 06:29.400
Okay, so first off, novels have been more than entertainment since they were created,

06:29.400 --> 06:32.920
and second of all, we've had novels set in the real world plenty of times.

06:32.920 --> 06:37.080
I'm not sure why Glenn feels the need to invent a new word here, but let's stop to

06:37.080 --> 06:39.600
appreciate the one he came up with.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.600
Faction?

06:40.600 --> 06:46.680
First of all, faction is already a word, but I'm pretty sure he wants it pronounced FACT-tion.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.920
This invented word does not bode well for the rest of this book.

06:50.920 --> 06:53.920
The rest of the note reads like classic Glenn Beck paranoia.

06:53.920 --> 06:58.480
He expertly gets so close to the line of outright proclaiming there's a conspiracy afoot,

06:58.480 --> 07:01.520
and then immediately walks it back, winking over his shoulder.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.520
Here's a prime example.

07:03.520 --> 07:08.680
But while many of the facts embedded in the plot are true, see the afterword for details,

07:08.680 --> 07:12.280
the scenarios I create as a result of those facts, along with the way things are tied

07:12.280 --> 07:16.040
together and the conclusions that are drawn, are entirely fictional.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.320
Let's hope they stay that way.

07:19.320 --> 07:22.800
Glenn lets us know that this book is complete fiction, and that he's just tried to warn

07:22.800 --> 07:27.360
us of something that is definitely not real, but it could be.

07:27.360 --> 07:31.620
And people say he's crazy for saying this could be true, and he's not saying that,

07:31.620 --> 07:33.120
but it could be.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.280
And I hope you can all see how this little game works.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.720
Get as close to the ridiculous line as you can, and you'll attract an audience willing

07:38.720 --> 07:44.280
to take that extra step in their minds, leaving you ostensibly blameless.

07:44.280 --> 07:47.000
Now let's dive into the story itself.

07:47.000 --> 07:51.920
Noah is a 28-year-old VP in a PR firm run by his father, Arthur.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.480
Here's how the book describes Noah.

07:53.480 --> 07:58.960
Good looking, great job, fine education, puckishly amusing, and even clever when he put his mind

07:58.960 --> 07:59.960
to it.

07:59.960 --> 08:04.720
Reasonably fit and trim for an office jockey, Noah had all the bona fide credentials for

08:04.720 --> 08:06.720
a killer e-harmony profile.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.040
Who could resist?

08:09.040 --> 08:10.440
Well I'll tell you who.

08:10.440 --> 08:15.040
The new girl working in the mail room who catches Noah's eye, a southern woman named

08:15.040 --> 08:16.560
Molly Ross.

08:16.560 --> 08:20.040
You can tell she's one of the book's heroes because, like only the most virtuous

08:20.040 --> 08:24.840
women in their 20s, she's hanging up flyers for her American Patriots group meeting for

08:24.840 --> 08:25.840
that evening.

08:25.840 --> 08:31.880
They call themselves, and I wish I was making this up, the Founders Keepers.

08:31.880 --> 08:37.760
Thankfully, the opposition isn't called something even stupider like Losers Reapers.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.240
Molly toys with Noah in exchanges like this one.

08:40.240 --> 08:44.240
For context, Noah has just said he'd be headed for the meeting Molly was posting flyers

08:44.240 --> 08:45.480
for.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.560
That reminds me of the joke, Molly said.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.720
Noah comes home, Noah from the Bible, you know?

08:50.720 --> 08:51.720
He nodded.

08:51.720 --> 08:55.480
So Noah comes home after he finally got all the animals into the ark and his wife asks

08:55.480 --> 08:57.040
him what he's been doing all week.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.240
Do you know what he said to her?

08:59.240 --> 09:01.120
No, tell me.

09:01.120 --> 09:05.000
Molly patted him on the cheek, pulled his face a little closer.

09:05.000 --> 09:09.440
He said, honey, now I heard everything.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.840
This is how the whole book is written.

09:11.840 --> 09:16.760
So Molly is a tough woman, not easily charmed by Noah, which is really easy to believe because

09:16.760 --> 09:19.760
Noah is completely lacking in charm.

09:19.760 --> 09:23.840
Next we meet Arthur, Noah's father and head of Doyle and Merchant.

09:23.840 --> 09:27.960
Arthur is a cold man, and he has a very low opinion of most people, especially compared

09:27.960 --> 09:28.960
to him.

09:28.960 --> 09:34.960
In the chapter we meet him, he gives us the first of what will be several long, dull monologues.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.440
This won't be a surprise to anyone who's familiar with the show Glenn Beck used to

09:38.440 --> 09:39.920
have on Fox News.

09:39.920 --> 09:45.040
Glenn had a tendency to go on these long, droning sermons, and when characters like

09:45.040 --> 09:49.440
Arthur in this chapter go on one, you can't help but hear Glenn Beck's voice come through

09:49.440 --> 09:51.360
every painful beat.

09:51.360 --> 09:56.520
I'll spare you the ten pages of ranting this guy goes on for and cut to the heart of it.

09:56.520 --> 10:01.520
Arthur's rant is largely just him explaining how the government is completely corrupt and

10:01.520 --> 10:06.160
that it needs to take control of the people, to usher them into a new age where they are

10:06.160 --> 10:08.880
safely under the thumb of the elites.

10:08.880 --> 10:13.280
That's basically everything Glenn imagines someone like Barack Obama is saying behind

10:13.280 --> 10:14.280
closed doors.

10:14.280 --> 10:18.560
The United States government has approached Arthur and his company for public relations

10:18.560 --> 10:22.480
help for a recent document that got leaked, listing various groups the government has

10:22.480 --> 10:23.760
under surveillance.

10:23.760 --> 10:28.040
The document is a list of conspiracy theorists, extreme conservative activists, and other

10:28.040 --> 10:32.160
names assigned to members of Glenn Beck's audience, along with a few outliers to make

10:32.160 --> 10:33.440
it seem legitimate.

10:33.440 --> 10:37.640
By placing his audience in the crosshairs, this is how Glenn Beck breeds loyalty.

10:37.640 --> 10:42.520
He's inventing a threat, using the supposed language of the dark left-wing establishment

10:42.520 --> 10:46.520
and telling his audience that they're being targeted with said words.

10:46.520 --> 10:50.720
Arthur eventually convinces the government that they should let him take the reins of

10:50.720 --> 10:54.480
their messaging because a grand opportunity is afoot.

10:54.480 --> 11:00.560
Now, Arthur Gardner said, his voice just above a whisper, while the tide is in our favor,

11:00.560 --> 11:01.560
come with me.

11:01.560 --> 11:05.680
You can still save yourselves, and in doing so, you can help us build a whole new world

11:05.680 --> 11:08.680
upon the ashes of the old.

11:08.680 --> 11:12.120
Noah heads over to the tavern Molly and her Patriot friends are all hanging out in.

11:12.120 --> 11:15.680
He obviously just wants to see Molly, though, because he's way into her.

11:15.680 --> 11:20.280
While on the way, Noah's out-of-control cab driver gets stopped by security forces, who

11:20.280 --> 11:23.080
are out in numbers because of the G20 summit happening.

11:23.080 --> 11:27.040
It's weird that this G20 plot point is brought up and never mentioned again, but it does

11:27.040 --> 11:31.600
give Noah the chance to use the sovereign citizen defense of, am I being detained?

11:31.600 --> 11:33.960
Which somehow totally works.

11:33.960 --> 11:38.120
His cab driver is less lucky, as he gets hauled away by cops.

11:38.120 --> 11:39.440
The rise met.

11:39.440 --> 11:40.560
Noah and that driver.

11:40.560 --> 11:45.120
What he was yelling now wasn't hard to understand, probably words he'd practiced from a phrasebook

11:45.120 --> 11:49.000
for some bad night that might come along when he'd need them.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.040
Help me, my friend.

11:51.040 --> 11:55.400
I have to offer partial credit to Glenn here for portraying this guy in a sympathetic light.

11:55.400 --> 11:59.120
He's clearly the victim, and if anything, Noah comes off as an asshole, shrugging it

11:59.120 --> 12:01.120
off and getting on with his evening.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.200
So there's some genuine sympathy here.

12:03.200 --> 12:08.480
Not enough to give this cab driver a name, background, or even closure since we never

12:08.480 --> 12:09.560
see him again.

12:09.560 --> 12:13.840
Also him mouthing those words, which for some reason aren't in quotation marks, are, as

12:13.840 --> 12:18.240
best I can tell, the only lines that were spoken by a person of color in this entire

12:18.240 --> 12:19.240
book.

12:19.240 --> 12:23.320
At least, the only character who is explicitly not white.

12:23.320 --> 12:27.200
Noah shrugs off the police state's shakedown and finally gets to the tavern to meet the

12:27.200 --> 12:28.920
founder's keepers.

12:28.920 --> 12:32.600
The crowd here are obviously meant to be stand-ins for the Tea Party movement, and it's cute

12:32.600 --> 12:35.380
how Glenn describes them like this.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.880
The diversity of the gathering was another surprise.

12:37.880 --> 12:42.120
There seemed to be no clear exclusions based on race or class or any of the other traditional

12:42.120 --> 12:45.080
media-fed American cultural divides.

12:45.080 --> 12:50.040
It was a total cross-section, a mix of everyone, three-piece suits rubbing elbows with t-shirts

12:50.040 --> 12:55.440
and sweatpants, yuppies chatting with hippies, black and white, young and old, a cowboy hat

12:55.440 --> 13:01.280
here, a $600 haircut there, all talking together, energetically agreeing and disagreeing as

13:01.280 --> 13:02.760
he moved through them.

13:02.760 --> 13:06.680
In the press, these sorts of meanings were typically depicted as the exclusive haunts

13:06.680 --> 13:11.000
of old white people of limited beings and even more limited intelligence.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.440
But this was everybody.

13:13.440 --> 13:19.360
This gathering of definitely not just white people reads as deeply insecure from the outside.

13:19.360 --> 13:23.040
But for anyone within the Tea Party movement, scenes like this must come across as sweet

13:23.040 --> 13:24.200
vindication.

13:24.200 --> 13:28.600
And even though Glenn claims this patriot gathering in his book is diverse, every character

13:28.600 --> 13:32.520
we meet who has any lines to speak will be white.

13:32.520 --> 13:37.760
Like Molly's friend Hollis, who is big and, uh, nice, I guess?

13:37.760 --> 13:40.520
There's really not a lot to say about this guy.

13:40.520 --> 13:44.200
And what would this gathering be without a few more Glenn Beck rants?

13:44.200 --> 13:48.240
A pair of them this time lasting eight and four pages, respectively.

13:48.240 --> 13:54.000
And it's here it starts to sink in that everyone basically agrees about how the world works.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.040
Even though the Founders' Keeper speakers are foils to Arthur Gardner, the content of

13:58.040 --> 14:03.600
their speeches talk about the same things, the impending disaster, the corruption right

14:03.600 --> 14:07.320
through the government, and how the elites are pulling all the strings.

14:07.320 --> 14:12.320
All these rants toss out facts, draw lazy connections, and everyone just nods along.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.440
There's no real debate or questioning of anything in this book.

14:15.440 --> 14:17.280
Everyone believes in the conspiracy.

14:17.280 --> 14:21.480
It's just a question of whether they support it or fight against it.

14:21.480 --> 14:25.920
The first of the two speakers is Beverly Emerson, Molly's mother.

14:25.920 --> 14:30.360
She manages to cite Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. without ever mentioning race.

14:30.360 --> 14:34.500
She also holds up a constitution and does what a lot of this book will do, present this

14:34.500 --> 14:36.920
document as a sacred text.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.640
She talks about the founding fathers less like men and more like prophets.

14:40.640 --> 14:45.080
The book is dripping with sanctification of the United States' founding.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.920
The next speech comes from a guy named Danny Bailey.

14:47.920 --> 14:53.560
His speech is lots of random facts, once again tenuously connected by arbitrary threads.

14:53.920 --> 14:57.840
Danny is presented as less credible than the other speakers, and perhaps more of a rabble

14:57.840 --> 14:58.840
rouser.

14:58.840 --> 15:03.420
He's someone who got famous through a viral YouTube video, and he acts like an egotistical

15:03.420 --> 15:04.420
rock star.

15:04.420 --> 15:07.880
He seems like an obvious analog for Glenn Beck himself.

15:07.880 --> 15:12.160
Noah scoffs at Danny's speech and gets instantly put on the spot, and then he goes into a rant

15:12.160 --> 15:16.120
of his own where, instead of presenting a different take on the fear-mongering and wild

15:16.120 --> 15:20.160
conspiracy theories being presented, he just agrees with them.

15:20.200 --> 15:24.720
This is all part of Noah's three-page rant, which is only interrupted when a gunshot goes

15:24.720 --> 15:27.120
off and the tavern is swarmed by police.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.520
Noah is arrested along with everyone else, but is eventually released because he's a

15:30.520 --> 15:32.120
rich guy with connections.

15:32.120 --> 15:35.280
Noah uses his connections to get the other Founders' Keeper's members released from

15:35.280 --> 15:39.280
prison, and he takes Molly and her mom to their respective homes in his limo.

15:39.280 --> 15:43.360
Molly's mom gets dropped off pretty quickly, so Noah and Molly can have a sort of date

15:43.360 --> 15:45.840
as he drives her around New York City.

15:45.840 --> 15:50.640
The limo ride is supposedly about Noah and Molly getting closer, but we instead get more

15:50.640 --> 15:57.080
long rants, highlighting, among many other things, how Bill Clinton was utterly ruthless.

15:57.080 --> 16:01.640
Somehow this rant about Bill Clinton charms Molly, and after a kiss, she follows Noah

16:01.640 --> 16:03.060
back to his apartment.

16:03.060 --> 16:08.100
The dialogue makes a shift from long-winded rants to painful banter between Noah and Molly.

16:08.100 --> 16:11.840
She lets him know she isn't going to have sex with him, and bonus points for Noah actually

16:11.840 --> 16:15.960
respecting her need to consent, especially since the scene ends with the two of them

16:15.960 --> 16:16.960
in bed together.

16:16.960 --> 16:21.320
If you thought a woman crawling into bed with a man and wrapping her arm around him would

16:21.320 --> 16:26.280
lead to a hookup, you'd be wrong, because this book is very squeamish about depicting

16:26.280 --> 16:27.280
sex.

16:27.280 --> 16:31.360
But maybe Molly realized she could never have sex with a man who says something like this.

16:31.360 --> 16:35.520
I'm telling you right now, you made the rules, but you're playing with fire here.

16:35.520 --> 16:41.520
I've got some rules too, and rule number one is, don't tease the panther.

16:41.520 --> 16:45.280
Who could possibly have sex with someone after they've said that?

16:45.280 --> 16:49.480
Elsewhere, Danny Bailey is approached by another major character for this book's plot, an

16:49.480 --> 16:52.760
FBI agent named Stuart Kearns.

16:52.760 --> 16:56.840
Kearns picks up Danny from the police station, taking Danny into his custody.

16:56.840 --> 17:01.520
Kearns has been working in deep cover for over a decade, posing as an online conspiracy

17:01.520 --> 17:02.520
theorist.

17:02.520 --> 17:06.680
His mission is to make people who question the government look like ridiculous paranoid

17:06.680 --> 17:07.680
weirdos.

17:07.680 --> 17:12.440
He's more or less embodying the real-world conspiracy theories that Alex Jones is a government

17:12.440 --> 17:19.040
plant designed to undercut other supposedly credible conspiracy theory movements.

17:19.040 --> 17:23.080
Kearns recruits an unwilling Danny with threats of jail time.

17:23.080 --> 17:27.480
He's using Danny, an activist with a degree of credibility and fame thanks to his YouTube

17:27.480 --> 17:33.320
viral video, to further the FBI's agenda to discredit right-wing activist groups.

17:33.320 --> 17:35.480
More on how this plot thread plays out later.

17:35.480 --> 17:39.560
The next morning, Molly starts to pressure Noah to break into his father's office to

17:39.560 --> 17:41.080
steal some documents.

17:41.080 --> 17:44.780
These documents are related to the meeting mentioned earlier where Arthur went on that

17:44.780 --> 17:50.360
Glenn Beck grant for 10 pages, the meeting about the leaked document that Arthur's firm

17:50.360 --> 17:52.200
was hired to cover up.

17:52.200 --> 17:55.520
Noah refuses to do it, and then Molly drops this on him.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.180
Do you want me to leave?

17:57.180 --> 18:00.160
Her voice was tight, and there were sudden tears in her eyes.

18:00.160 --> 18:02.360
Do you never want to see me again?

18:02.360 --> 18:04.120
Because that's what this means.

18:04.120 --> 18:08.040
The book is helpfully establishing that Molly is also an awful person.

18:08.040 --> 18:13.240
Noah and Molly break into the office by using the very clever covert method of Noah using

18:13.240 --> 18:18.160
his keycard to walk in, and suddenly the conspiracy everyone already believed in is revealed

18:18.160 --> 18:20.200
via some PowerPoint slides.

18:20.200 --> 18:24.560
The grand plan is to trigger a catastrophic event that will shift the Overton window in

18:24.560 --> 18:29.120
the direction towards creating more government oversight, taking away people's freedom.

18:29.120 --> 18:33.160
All this physical evidence of a grand conspiracy only gets vaguely mentioned throughout the

18:33.160 --> 18:36.920
rest of this book, because the only thing that really matters in this scene is that

18:36.920 --> 18:42.240
Noah and Molly have learned that something big is happening within the next few days,

18:42.240 --> 18:45.640
possibly a terrorist attack staged by the shadowy group.

18:45.640 --> 18:49.680
The break-in scene also gives us a nice list of objectives the shadowy group has lined

18:49.680 --> 18:54.800
up which include things like social justice and internationalism, but I want to highlight

18:54.800 --> 18:57.760
one particular bullet point on this list.

18:57.760 --> 19:04.080
Expand malleable voter base and agenda support by granting voting rights to prison inmates,

19:04.080 --> 19:08.920
undocumented migrants, and select U.S. territories, Puerto Rico.

19:08.920 --> 19:15.480
Image as a civil rights issue, labeled dissenters as racist, invoke reliable analogies, slavery,

19:15.480 --> 19:18.960
Nazism, segregation, isolationism.

19:18.960 --> 19:23.240
The phrase malleable voter base has a lot, especially when we're talking about the specific

19:23.240 --> 19:28.120
people that make up prison inmates, undocumented migrants, and Puerto Rico.

19:28.120 --> 19:31.240
We're talking about the Black and Hispanic populations.

19:31.240 --> 19:34.400
Why exactly are these people malleable?

19:34.400 --> 19:37.440
Could it perhaps have something to do with their race?

19:37.440 --> 19:41.140
The most charitable interpretation I could come up with is that being given the right

19:41.140 --> 19:46.040
to vote would make them become the tools of whatever party gave them that right.

19:46.040 --> 19:50.080
Imagine this argument being used against giving women the right to vote.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.880
And how are people convicted in prison more malleable?

19:52.880 --> 19:54.840
I'd expect the opposite, to be honest.

19:54.840 --> 19:58.320
And let's not mince words about undocumented migrants.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.600
This isn't just about granting them voting rights.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.880
This is about the power of citizenship.

20:02.880 --> 20:07.120
This whole little section is just another example of one of the uglier forms of racist

20:07.120 --> 20:10.640
disenfranchisement Glenn Beck smuggles into his work.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.000
Back to the plot.

20:12.000 --> 20:16.520
Noah and Molly head over to the secret hideout of the Founders Keepers, a small apartment

20:16.520 --> 20:19.240
in a less-than-reputable New York City neighborhood.

20:19.240 --> 20:23.360
It's filled with conspiracy theory literature and tons of guns.

20:23.360 --> 20:27.620
Hollis shows up again to give us a painful metaphor about how guns are like cookies.

20:27.620 --> 20:29.720
The best ones are homemade.

20:29.720 --> 20:33.360
I don't think that's true, but it hardly matters, because Hollis goes away after that

20:33.360 --> 20:35.560
and we never see him again.

20:35.560 --> 20:36.940
Nice knowing you, Hollis.

20:36.940 --> 20:39.040
We meet some other members of the Founders Keepers.

20:39.040 --> 20:43.720
They're named Patrick, Ethan, George, Thomas, Benjamin, Samuel, John, Alexander, James,

20:43.720 --> 20:48.320
Nathaniel, another Benjamin, Franklin, Rush, William, and Steven.

20:48.320 --> 20:52.280
These names, as you might have guessed, belong to the various Founding Fathers, and they

20:52.280 --> 20:54.600
aren't the actual names of the characters.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.960
Each one of these characters has been tasked with memorizing the works of the corresponding

20:58.960 --> 21:03.060
Founding Father, and they sit around in a circle reciting the words to one another.

21:03.060 --> 21:07.760
This is something lifted directly from Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, in which all books

21:07.760 --> 21:11.860
are being burned by a totalitarian government, and people in the Resistance commit books

21:11.860 --> 21:15.400
to memory to save their contents for future generations.

21:15.400 --> 21:19.080
It doesn't really work in the context of the Overton Window, though, since it's not

21:19.080 --> 21:22.780
like the writings of the Founding Fathers are being banned or destroyed.

21:22.780 --> 21:25.160
The book says people are just kind of ignoring them.

21:25.160 --> 21:29.360
I'm not sure how these handful of people memorizing them is going to change that.

21:29.360 --> 21:34.020
To me, it reads more like these characters treating these works like scripture, something

21:34.020 --> 21:37.680
to be committed to heart and shared in these prayer circles.

21:37.680 --> 21:41.960
We also get some revisionist history as Glenn Beck frames the American Revolution as being

21:41.960 --> 21:48.280
led from the pulpit, and credits the success of the Revolution to Americans staying religious.

21:48.280 --> 21:52.400
You could make several videos about how the very selective reading of history Glenn Beck

21:52.400 --> 21:56.800
has of the Founding Fathers, painting them as former religious than they were, but that's

21:56.800 --> 22:00.400
a project for another book review, because there's so much more to go through in this

22:00.400 --> 22:01.600
one.

22:01.600 --> 22:07.200
The scene ends with Noah enjoying some lemonade, only to realize he had been drugged by Molly.

22:07.200 --> 22:08.320
Betrayal.

22:08.320 --> 22:13.040
As Danny and Agent Kerns travel along, we get some more talk about how accidents don't

22:13.040 --> 22:17.840
just happen, and how Danny's own message, when it inspires violence, is actually being

22:17.840 --> 22:21.960
twisted and distorted by the government, making it seem more violent than it really is.

22:21.960 --> 22:25.360
I can't help but suspect Glenn might think of himself this way, or at least see it as

22:25.360 --> 22:30.080
a convenient excuse when one of his listeners gets a little too excited.

22:30.080 --> 22:34.360
For instance, when his conspiracy theory about the Tides Foundation led to one of his listeners

22:34.360 --> 22:36.880
driving down there trying to shoot it up.

22:36.880 --> 22:40.940
We learn a bit more of Agent Kerns' plan as he reveals he's stolen a fake nuclear

22:40.940 --> 22:46.120
missile that he's delivering to a group of his more violent conspiracy theorist followers.

22:46.120 --> 22:51.840
Kerns, being a really clever FBI agent, lets his hostage, Danny, grab a beer at a roadside

22:51.840 --> 22:53.680
bar, all on his own.

22:53.680 --> 22:58.440
Danny, not being a complete idiot, takes this chance to send a text message to Molly, informing

22:58.440 --> 23:04.360
her to stay away from Las Vegas, and that the FBI is going to do something soon.

23:04.360 --> 23:08.680
The five dudes Kerns and Danny are meeting are led by a guy named Elmer.

23:08.680 --> 23:12.920
Using nothing more than his paranoia and knowledge of random facts, Danny also figures out this

23:12.920 --> 23:19.080
Elmer guy must be Muhammad Atta, the guy behind the September 11th attacks, because, and I

23:19.080 --> 23:23.960
kid you not, Atta at one time used the alias El Amir.

23:23.960 --> 23:29.320
Of course there's the problem of Muhammad Atta having died in the 9-11 attacks, but

23:29.320 --> 23:33.920
that's brushed aside as the US government manufacturing the idea that Muhammad Atta

23:33.920 --> 23:38.880
is behind this nuclear attack, using the alias Elmer for some reason.

23:38.880 --> 23:42.040
The logic here doesn't work, and for what it's worth, I believe the book is trying

23:42.040 --> 23:45.840
to portray Danny as the unreliable conspiracy theorist.

23:45.840 --> 23:49.680
How is Danny supposed to be less believable than Molly or Noah?

23:49.680 --> 23:54.680
He goes on the same kinds of rants with tenuous connections between everything he says, but

23:54.680 --> 23:57.520
what makes him wrong and other characters right?

23:57.520 --> 23:59.880
But that's actually missing the point of this book.

23:59.880 --> 24:03.800
This book isn't trying to convince us of a specific conspiracy, it's to get us to

24:03.800 --> 24:06.800
adopt the conspiratorial mindset.

24:06.800 --> 24:10.800
Noah is revived after being drugged by Molly, and he's lectured by Arthur, who reveals

24:10.800 --> 24:12.000
more of the plot.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.920
It seems Molly infiltrated the PR company with the goal of releasing the document mentioned

24:16.920 --> 24:20.640
way back in the beginning of the book, you know that government document that was leaked

24:20.640 --> 24:23.040
listing all of the government's enemies.

24:23.040 --> 24:28.040
Now Molly was working for the PR firm that was hired to spin the news of the leaked document,

24:28.040 --> 24:32.680
but how did she get access to the document before it got leaked?

24:32.680 --> 24:37.480
How did the PR firm even know it existed until the government came to them to cover up the

24:37.480 --> 24:38.680
leak?

24:38.680 --> 24:41.520
I don't know how they got the document in the first place, none of this really makes

24:41.520 --> 24:44.360
sense, but we're just supposed to roll with this.

24:44.360 --> 24:45.360
Okay.

24:45.360 --> 24:49.280
Molly's bigger role in the infiltration though was to seduce Noah into revealing all those

24:49.280 --> 24:52.880
precious PowerPoint slides he led her to a few chapters ago.

24:52.880 --> 24:57.480
This does explain how she tolerated his awful sense of humor and creepy jokes, but how

24:57.480 --> 24:59.640
did Noah fall for this so easily?

24:59.640 --> 25:04.200
Well, turns out Molly had been researching Noah for months on social media, learning

25:04.200 --> 25:08.720
everything about him, but the key was when she found a certain photo that represented

25:08.720 --> 25:11.760
exactly what Noah was looking for in a woman.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.280
We learn about it in this excerpt.

25:14.280 --> 25:19.120
Noah turned over another page, and the next item hit him like a blow to the midsection.

25:19.120 --> 25:22.640
He thought for the first second that it was another picture of Molly, and it seemed that

25:22.640 --> 25:24.520
was exactly the point.

25:24.520 --> 25:28.160
It was a photo of Noah's mother.

25:28.160 --> 25:32.360
Molly seduced Noah by dressing up as his dead mother.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.360
Let's move on.

25:33.360 --> 25:37.960
Arthur tries to talk some sense into Noah by explaining how people are inherently evil.

25:37.960 --> 25:43.200
Then we find out the impending terror attack was actually Arthur's ideal this whole time.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.840
Noah soon learns that Molly's mother is in the hospital, and armed with the truth about

25:46.840 --> 25:52.400
how Molly and her mother used him, he storms right down there to confront her with the

25:52.400 --> 25:56.840
best possible care money can buy because he still totally loves Molly.

25:56.840 --> 26:00.560
After all, what's a little deception and drugging when you finally meet someone who

26:00.560 --> 26:04.760
looks like your mother and doesn't run away screaming when you refer to yourself as the

26:04.760 --> 26:06.440
panther?

26:06.440 --> 26:10.640
In the scene, we also meet a doctor named Ellen Davenport who gives Noah the details

26:10.640 --> 26:12.900
of how Molly's mother was poisoned.

26:12.900 --> 26:17.200
We also find out she and Noah have some romantic history, but forget all that because we don't

26:17.200 --> 26:19.480
see Ellen again for the rest of the book.

26:19.480 --> 26:23.960
Molly's mother is dying, but points Noah towards the hotel Molly is hiding out in.

26:23.960 --> 26:28.720
A hotel near the airport because Arthur has informed law enforcement of all the people

26:28.720 --> 26:31.640
within Molly's group and they're currently being hunted.

26:31.640 --> 26:33.760
Molly needs to get out of the city.

26:33.760 --> 26:38.160
Noah heads to the hotel and is reunited with Molly, immediately forgiving her, and he decides

26:38.160 --> 26:40.400
to help her sneak out of New York City.

26:40.400 --> 26:45.040
To get past security, Noah calls up a fancy security detail that celebrities use to cut

26:45.040 --> 26:47.160
through all the lines at the airport.

26:47.160 --> 26:52.120
Molly conveniently not only looks like Noah's mother, but also looks like Natalie Portman.

26:52.120 --> 26:55.040
And I'm glad I was able to get around to that because that's the reason I chose that

26:55.040 --> 26:56.360
picture.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.960
Noah thinks posing as Natalie Portman is a great disguise because...

26:59.960 --> 27:02.280
It's perfect, Noah said.

27:02.280 --> 27:06.840
She's an A-lister, but she's done mostly art house films, so the average Joe probably

27:06.840 --> 27:09.040
couldn't pick her out of a lineup.

27:09.040 --> 27:11.880
This book was written in 2010.

27:11.880 --> 27:16.280
As Noah and Molly approach security, Noah suddenly remembers that Natalie Portman was

27:16.280 --> 27:20.800
in the Star Wars movies, something Molly apparently doesn't know at all.

27:20.800 --> 27:25.920
The TSA security guy, who Noah suspects is a Star Wars nerd, doesn't say anything until

27:25.920 --> 27:27.840
the metal detector goes off.

27:27.840 --> 27:31.840
Molly forgot to take off her metal jewelry before going through it, including her necklace

27:31.840 --> 27:34.000
with its silver cross.

27:34.000 --> 27:38.800
Security guard is immediately suspicious because he knows Natalie Portman is actually Jewish,

27:38.800 --> 27:40.680
and he asks Molly about it.

27:40.680 --> 27:45.000
As Noah sweats it out, he thinks about how awesome cops are.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.320
Perhaps no liars like plumbers know leaks.

27:47.320 --> 27:49.760
They encounter them every day, all day.

27:49.760 --> 27:54.120
They know all the little signs and symptoms, and they're trained to understand that where

27:54.120 --> 27:58.720
there's even a little whiff of smoke, one should always assume there's a fire.

27:58.720 --> 28:02.720
As they challenge a person, they study their reactions, pick apart the little telltale

28:02.720 --> 28:07.320
movements, listen to the timbre of the voice, and more than anything else, they watch the

28:07.320 --> 28:08.320
eyes.

28:08.320 --> 28:13.400
Most suspects have already made a full confession by the time they begin their denial.

28:13.400 --> 28:15.760
That reads pretty creepy to me.

28:15.760 --> 28:18.760
Cops know someone is lying just by looking at them.

28:18.760 --> 28:22.360
How can anyone but a fascist believe something so stupid?

28:22.360 --> 28:23.360
Back to the story.

28:23.360 --> 28:27.160
Molly is confident she can handle the TSA security guy and decides to talk her way out

28:27.160 --> 28:28.160
of the predicament.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.920
This is a long passage, but I have to read all of it.

28:31.920 --> 28:36.400
She turned to the officer, pulled back her hood and let it settle onto her shoulders,

28:36.400 --> 28:40.540
removed the baseball cap and let it fall to the floor at her feet, and then slow and sure

28:40.540 --> 28:42.320
began to walk toward him.

28:42.320 --> 28:47.720
The force is strong with this one, Molly said, as calm and smooth as a Jedi master.

28:47.720 --> 28:52.520
Her accent was gone and her voice was just breathy enough to obscure any other identifying

28:52.520 --> 28:54.880
qualities of the real McCoy.

28:54.880 --> 29:00.640
The TSA man's cheeks began to redden slightly, a power shift was underway, and as Noah had

29:00.640 --> 29:06.080
learned firsthand, when this girl turned it on, you never knew what was about to hit you.

29:06.080 --> 29:11.520
She continued nearer, put a finger to the frames, and lowered her sunglasses partway

29:11.540 --> 29:16.580
down her nose, tipping her chin so she could look at the officer directly, eye to eye,

29:16.580 --> 29:18.820
just over the top of the darkened lenses.

29:18.820 --> 29:23.720
As she stopped, barely a foot away, she subtly passed an open hand between their faces and

29:23.720 --> 29:24.720
spoke again.

29:24.720 --> 29:29.180
These aren't the droids you're looking for, Molly said.

29:29.180 --> 29:33.420
After waiting a moment, she gave him a little nod, as though it had come time in their close-up

29:33.420 --> 29:36.520
scene for his own line of dialogue.

29:36.520 --> 29:41.080
There was an eternal pause, and then before his eyes, Noah saw this big, intimidating

29:41.080 --> 29:46.760
young man begin his grinning transformation from the TSA's most vigilant watchdog into

29:46.760 --> 29:49.360
Natalie Portman's biggest fan.

29:49.360 --> 29:53.480
These aren't the droids we're looking for, the officer repeated her words just as that

29:53.480 --> 30:00.080
spellbound stormtrooper had said them at the Imperial checkpoint in Episode 4.

30:00.080 --> 30:05.720
Molly used her deep knowledge of Star Wars to give us one of the cringiest scenes I've

30:05.720 --> 30:06.720
ever read.

30:06.720 --> 30:12.120
Lucky for Molly, who hasn't seen the prequels, happened to write a midterm paper on the first

30:12.120 --> 30:15.520
two movies for her political science class.

30:15.520 --> 30:19.640
This is the point I nearly dropped the book and discussed, but we're nearly done, so

30:19.640 --> 30:21.360
let's keep going.

30:21.360 --> 30:25.480
As Noah and Molly board a plane, we find out it isn't headed for safety.

30:25.480 --> 30:28.160
Molly is taking them directly to Las Vegas.

30:28.160 --> 30:32.360
To pass the time, Molly sleeps, and Noah reads some of the books she brought along

30:32.360 --> 30:33.360
with her.

30:33.360 --> 30:35.400
Really, they're the writings of the founding fathers.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.640
It's true this that Noah finally understands why they were so great, and he's ready to

30:39.640 --> 30:43.800
create something real with Molly, giving her the polyamorous relationship she was hoping

30:43.800 --> 30:44.800
for.

30:44.800 --> 30:48.840
Molly, Noah, and America.

30:48.840 --> 30:53.120
Danny and Agent Kerns finally have the real meeting with the five dudes to exchange the

30:53.120 --> 30:57.280
fake nuke, though we find out that Elmer has stood them up.

30:57.280 --> 31:01.360
There's a tent standoff with the four dudes, followed by a shootout.

31:01.360 --> 31:04.800
Danny and Kerns manage to take out three of the guys, but the fourth one jumps into

31:04.800 --> 31:06.960
their truck and drives off.

31:06.960 --> 31:11.040
Danny and Kerns manage to sneak into the back, only to find a dead body.

31:11.040 --> 31:15.800
It's Kerns' handler, and conveniently the only man who knew Kerns was undercover, and

31:15.800 --> 31:20.800
he's been murdered, and next to him is a second nuclear weapon.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.520
Apparently the four dudes had a second nuke in their truck the whole time.

31:24.520 --> 31:27.320
They wanted two, for some reason.

31:27.320 --> 31:31.440
Somehow Kerns knows that he and his handler were set up the exact same way, delivering

31:31.440 --> 31:35.760
two nukes to these five guys so they could stage a terrorist attack in Las Vegas.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.520
I don't know why they needed two nukes.

31:38.520 --> 31:42.320
Danny and Kerns chill out in the back of the truck for a bit, and short of ammo, figure

31:42.320 --> 31:46.680
there's no way to overpower the armed guy who's driving the truck, who still hasn't

31:46.680 --> 31:48.280
discovered them yet.

31:48.280 --> 31:53.220
Being in the middle of the desert, their pre-arranged meeting place, Kerns and Danny realize the

31:53.220 --> 31:56.720
only logical thing to do is to blow up the nuke.

31:57.620 --> 32:01.720
As Noah and Molly arrive in Las Vegas, before the nuke has gone off, they start driving

32:01.720 --> 32:03.800
towards the coordinates Danny gave them.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.720
Noah tries to convince Molly to give up, even though he apparently understands what it means

32:07.720 --> 32:09.320
to love America.

32:09.320 --> 32:13.560
Noah still thinks it's hopeless, and with less than 50 pages left in the book, I'm

32:13.560 --> 32:18.040
getting very impatient for our hero to do anything remotely heroic.

32:18.040 --> 32:21.640
Molly doesn't think Noah gets it, and he eventually hovers to jump out of the moving

32:21.640 --> 32:23.920
car so she can go on alone.

32:23.920 --> 32:24.920
And then he does that.

32:24.920 --> 32:28.980
He tries to flag down some people driving down the road, including security forces chasing

32:28.980 --> 32:31.740
Molly when the nuke goes off behind him.

32:31.740 --> 32:36.640
According to Noah, it feels like a hot summer wind.

32:36.640 --> 32:40.400
Noah of course survives the nuke, because I guess he was far enough away.

32:40.400 --> 32:44.680
He's arrested, though, and waterboarded, and when he can't reveal any secrets because

32:44.680 --> 32:49.920
he doesn't know any, he's taken to a room where he undergoes electroconvulsive therapy.

32:49.920 --> 32:54.900
Arthur arrives to give Noah a chance to redeem himself, which Arthur believes Noah does when

32:54.900 --> 33:03.300
Noah recites part of that Rudyard Kipling poem that was one of Arthur's favorites.

33:03.300 --> 33:05.820
The epilogue takes place sometime in the future.

33:05.820 --> 33:09.260
Noah is being kept in a special prison for political dissidents.

33:09.260 --> 33:14.060
He's being tasked with writing a creative confession implicating his former cohorts,

33:14.060 --> 33:18.740
but try as he might, he can't hide the facts of what heroes the Founders Keepers were.

33:18.740 --> 33:23.260
I'm not sure what heroic things they did, and he couldn't possibly know about Danny

33:23.260 --> 33:27.740
detonating that nuke, which I guess is heroic, I'm not sure why.

33:27.740 --> 33:32.420
While Noah is in prison, a guard slips him a message, and Molly's bracelet, they've

33:32.420 --> 33:36.320
got work for him to do, and Molly is waiting for him.

33:36.320 --> 33:39.900
And so ends the narrative portion of the Overton window.

33:39.900 --> 33:42.980
I say the narrative portion because the book isn't over yet.

33:42.980 --> 33:46.940
We also have an afterword from Glenn where he lists the many sources he used for this

33:46.940 --> 33:52.660
book, and how some of the crazy conspiracy theories he used might be worth taking more

33:52.660 --> 33:53.660
seriously.

33:53.660 --> 33:58.420
He also happily explains how Danny was supposed to be the crazy one, and offers some reasonable

33:58.420 --> 34:02.820
explanation as to why his theories were baseless, explanations that would have been very helpful

34:02.820 --> 34:06.940
within the actual novel, but hey, I guess having them in the afterword is better than

34:06.940 --> 34:07.940
nothing at all.

34:07.940 --> 34:11.700
It also would have been nice if Glenn had looked into the other conspiracy theories

34:11.700 --> 34:14.900
he peddled throughout this book, but we don't get any of that either.

34:14.900 --> 34:16.340
That's not what this book is about.

34:16.340 --> 34:21.220
Danny is the token conspiracy theory nut used to buy the appearance of Glenn being a credible

34:21.220 --> 34:22.220
broker.

34:22.220 --> 34:26.460
He's also the one smuggling in other conspiracy theories that are just as baseless, but making

34:26.460 --> 34:31.740
them seem more respectable because they're coming out of the mouths of reputable characters.

34:31.740 --> 34:35.260
And that's what this book is all about, mainstreaming conspiratorial thinking.

34:35.260 --> 34:39.140
At least Glenn Beck is honest in the afterword about him trying to manipulate the Overton

34:39.140 --> 34:47.620
window, only he's not pushing it towards liberty, he's pushing it towards paranoia.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.420
First let's talk about this book's style.

34:49.420 --> 34:54.860
Although it clocks in at 292 pages, not counting the afterword, it's a surprisingly brisk

34:54.860 --> 34:55.860
read.

34:55.860 --> 35:02.020
It works out to 47 chapters with a prologue and epilogue, so roughly 6 pages per section,

35:02.020 --> 35:06.060
and certain parts of the book feel like they're moving in fast forward, with the notable exception

35:06.060 --> 35:11.260
being that Founders Keeper gathering at the tavern which ran on for 6 chapters.

35:11.260 --> 35:14.540
So in this book you're never in a bad scene for too long before another one comes up to

35:14.540 --> 35:15.580
replace it.

35:15.580 --> 35:18.740
The problem is, it's never replaced by anything good.

35:18.740 --> 35:23.180
What little space is afforded to chapters is wasted with pointless aside, such as that

35:23.180 --> 35:26.820
random paragraph about cops being lie detectors.

35:26.820 --> 35:30.900
I know something like that is supposed to build tension, but it feels ham-fisted into

35:30.900 --> 35:35.140
a scene that was already absurd and way too brief to create any real tension.

35:35.140 --> 35:38.900
Any drama that was supposed to be here just doesn't come across.

35:38.900 --> 35:39.900
And the rants.

35:39.900 --> 35:42.020
There is so much to say about the ranting.

35:42.020 --> 35:44.940
Every character has a monologue, and they're all the same.

35:44.940 --> 35:49.260
The government is corrupt, Spindy is out of control, and there are shadowy forces manipulating

35:49.260 --> 35:50.340
the world.

35:50.340 --> 35:54.500
By the third or fourth rant, I had heard everything there was to be said about this particular

35:54.500 --> 35:58.780
theory, but I was well aware that this being a book by Glenn Beck, he wasn't about to

35:58.780 --> 36:00.060
stop repeating himself.

36:00.060 --> 36:02.940
Those pages need fill-in.

36:02.940 --> 36:07.540
And to go back briefly to that bullet point on malleable voters, as someone on the left

36:07.540 --> 36:12.060
I obviously believe there are some real arguments to be made on why people who live within the

36:12.060 --> 36:18.020
United States deserve voting rights, and in the case of undocumented immigrants, citizenship.

36:18.020 --> 36:21.860
And perhaps you're someone who disagrees with that, and we could even debate it.

36:21.860 --> 36:24.660
But we don't see those clashing viewpoints here.

36:24.660 --> 36:29.940
The well is being poisoned because these arguments are never made by genuine activists or people

36:29.940 --> 36:32.140
who believe there's some merit to the argument.

36:32.140 --> 36:37.020
It's by a shadowy group cynically using these concerns to advance their agenda.

36:37.020 --> 36:41.580
It's similar to the violent activist groups, specifically right-wing ones who are only

36:41.580 --> 36:47.060
portrayed as violent when that shadowy group sends in infiltrators and manipulates them.

36:47.060 --> 36:51.260
The normal people we meet in this world all acknowledge the reality of secret conspiracies

36:51.260 --> 36:53.560
that Glenn wants you to believe.

36:53.560 --> 36:58.900
This book is about degrading trust in the institutions around us, specifically the government

36:58.900 --> 37:03.860
and the media, who are all secretly working together, working against freedom and America

37:03.860 --> 37:06.500
and other things people have an implicit love of.

37:06.500 --> 37:11.020
The book is telling us not to trust the supposed protectors of these ideals.

37:11.460 --> 37:13.580
And this is the most important part.

37:13.580 --> 37:18.300
The book does want you to know that you can trust Glenn, who supposedly doesn't want

37:18.300 --> 37:23.180
to be right about this stuff, but he is and is the only person you can trust.

37:23.180 --> 37:28.100
And you can demonstrate that trust by buying one of his books, watching his TV show, or

37:28.100 --> 37:31.440
nowadays, signing up for a membership at the blaze.

37:31.440 --> 37:36.100
And if the conspiracies he tells you support one political party over another, or more

37:36.100 --> 37:41.740
accurately demonizes one party in particular, and if there are some financial interests

37:41.740 --> 37:46.860
that want to demonize said party and champion the other, and they want to use their money

37:46.860 --> 37:51.300
to support Glenn, well, that's just something that happens in the world, isn't it?

37:51.300 --> 37:55.300
But damn it, did I just suggest there's an actual conspiracy theory here, that Glenn

37:55.300 --> 38:00.380
Beck is peddling a bunch of lies to push conservative talking points like flat tax and climate

38:00.380 --> 38:04.780
denial to the public, and that moneyed interests like Fox News, which hired him to spew this

38:04.780 --> 38:08.380
nonsense and find it very useful to spread information that will ultimately support

38:08.380 --> 38:09.660
the Republican Party?

38:09.660 --> 38:11.540
Is that the conspiracy I'm pushing?

38:11.540 --> 38:14.060
No, that's not what a conspiracy is.

38:14.060 --> 38:18.380
The only part of what I described that might be a secret is the idea that Glenn Beck is

38:18.380 --> 38:19.620
genuine.

38:19.620 --> 38:22.700
Before leaving this book entirely, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about

38:22.700 --> 38:23.700
its reception.

38:23.700 --> 38:27.540
The general critical response was, as you might have guessed, not generous.

38:27.540 --> 38:32.380
The reviews published at the time from most mainstream outlets criticized its clumsy prose,

38:32.380 --> 38:34.540
bland characters, and rushed plot.

38:34.540 --> 38:39.180
Worst of all, for a thriller, most people noticed how it wasn't thrilling at all.

38:39.180 --> 38:42.020
I mean, I just gave you the plot synopsis.

38:42.020 --> 38:46.340
Point to any moment that was genuinely thrilling, I would love to hear that.

38:46.340 --> 38:49.820
The Overton Window did hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list when it came

38:49.820 --> 38:53.340
out on June 15th, and stayed on that list for three months.

38:53.340 --> 38:57.340
Looking around online, reviews from readers of the book are generally positive, though

38:57.340 --> 38:59.340
not what I would call enthusiastic.

38:59.340 --> 39:04.620
It scored a 3.5 on goodreads, with most people mentioning how breezy a read it was.

39:04.620 --> 39:06.420
There were a few comments that stood out to me, though.

39:06.420 --> 39:09.940
I like this one review from Elizabeth, who gave it one star.

39:09.940 --> 39:14.420
If part of your goal is to teach, by example, here you're shooting yourself in the foot

39:14.420 --> 39:18.780
by communicating to the world that a name and some fast, poorly written fiction with

39:18.780 --> 39:23.540
jumbled ideas is exactly what the Founding Fathers had hoped for in the future and potential

39:23.540 --> 39:26.620
of America that you so often revere and expound.

39:26.620 --> 39:31.420
A short version of the reviews I read is that fans of Glenn Beck loved it, and non-Beck

39:31.420 --> 39:36.140
fans remained unmoved, although even some Glenn Beck fans were a bit disappointed with

39:36.140 --> 39:37.700
how poorly it was written.

39:37.700 --> 39:40.260
But maybe we can't blame Glenn for that himself.

39:40.260 --> 39:44.980
In an interview with USA Today, Glenn copped to not having been the actual writer of this

39:44.980 --> 39:46.060
book.

39:46.060 --> 39:49.460
On the title page, Beck shares credit with three contributors.

39:49.460 --> 39:55.500
He calls the conspiracy novel My Story, but he says Jack Anderson, one of his contributors,

39:55.500 --> 39:58.020
went in and he put the words down.

39:58.020 --> 40:03.300
Other novelists might not acknowledge such help, but Beck, a self-described fiscal conservative

40:03.300 --> 40:07.580
and common-sense libertarian, says, I'm a team kind of guy.

40:07.580 --> 40:13.340
The title page credits Kevin Balfi, Emily Bestler, and Jack Anderson, but as Glenn's quote

40:13.340 --> 40:17.820
alluded to, Jack Henderson, in particular, is a person of interest.

40:17.820 --> 40:21.600
It's kind of weird to think that Glenn hired a professional writer to ghost-write this

40:21.600 --> 40:25.060
entire book, but it still turned out the way it did.

40:25.060 --> 40:30.860
What's truly wonderful about this is that it seems Henderson might have actually conned

40:30.860 --> 40:31.940
Glenn Beck.

40:31.940 --> 40:36.380
In an article on the Huffington Post, Chris Kelly notes that the Overton window is suspiciously

40:36.380 --> 40:42.020
similar to one of Henderson's earlier works, Circumference of Darkness, published in 2007.

40:42.020 --> 40:46.260
I couldn't bring myself to read a longer version of the same novel story with awful

40:46.260 --> 40:50.500
writing to verify how similar they are, but I'm willing to say at least their plots have

40:50.500 --> 40:52.300
a few things in common.

40:52.300 --> 40:58.260
Both involve a guy being seduced by a lovely woman to help take down a group of terrorists

40:58.260 --> 41:00.740
who are planning to detonate a nuke.

41:00.740 --> 41:05.380
Only in Henderson's earlier work, it's a right-wing group that's behind everything

41:05.380 --> 41:07.060
and not a left-wing one.

41:07.060 --> 41:11.860
Glenn Beck responded to this article himself, and he was outraged because he seems to think

41:11.860 --> 41:14.500
Kelly was accusing him of plagiarism.

41:14.500 --> 41:19.360
It's not that Glenn Beck plagiarized anything, it's that Jack Henderson wrote a book for

41:19.360 --> 41:23.720
Glenn Beck that was just a recycled version of a book he had previously written.

41:23.720 --> 41:28.320
That Glenn had read Circumference of Darkness and didn't notice that it had recycled the

41:28.320 --> 41:29.920
same plot is kind of funny.

41:29.920 --> 41:33.840
So the only person getting ripped off here is Glenn, and I'm so glad we could find at

41:33.840 --> 41:36.080
least one happy ending here.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.960
The idea of Glenn Beck being a dishonest grifter shouldn't surprise anyone.

41:39.960 --> 41:43.680
Several years after this book was published when Glenn Beck had been exiled from Fox News

41:43.680 --> 41:47.880
and was trying to stay relevant with his own outlet, The Blaze, he tried to continue his

41:47.880 --> 41:52.120
anti-establishment shtick by being a never-Trumper conservative.

41:52.120 --> 41:56.360
Donald Trump is a dictator in the making.

41:56.360 --> 42:02.600
You called him a sociopath, dangerous, unhinged, unstable, and you compared him to Adolf Hitler.

42:02.600 --> 42:04.400
I don't think I compared him to Adolf Hitler.

42:04.400 --> 42:06.280
Nobody can be compared to Adolf Hitler.

42:06.280 --> 42:11.760
I said Adolf Hitler of the 1930s and 40s is not Adolf Hitler of the 1920s.

42:11.760 --> 42:21.720
Nobody who can reach in and stir a crowd like that has a moral compass that is wishy-washy

42:21.720 --> 42:23.160
at best.

42:23.160 --> 42:25.880
They don't all turn into Adolf Hitler's.

42:25.880 --> 42:26.880
But one of them did.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.280
He even got to appear on Samantha Bee's show wearing a dumb sweater trying to get some

42:30.280 --> 42:31.760
cred with the left.

42:31.760 --> 42:36.200
When his already diminished audience, compared to his Fox days, kept shrinking, he ran into

42:36.200 --> 42:39.040
the arms of Daddy Trump and never looked back.

42:39.040 --> 42:45.720
Now he's hired such luminaries as Lauren Chen, Dave Rubin, and Steven Crowder, amplifying

42:45.720 --> 42:48.300
their dopey conservative talking points.

42:48.300 --> 42:52.600
The problem of Glenn Peck is the impact he's had on American society.

42:52.600 --> 42:57.120
It can't be understated how much the shift of the Overton window to the right has frozen

42:57.120 --> 43:00.800
and in some cases pulled back progress in the United States.

43:00.800 --> 43:06.160
When you prime a sizable portion of the electorate to reject the establishment in favor of conspiracy

43:06.160 --> 43:11.240
theories that are covers for far-right policies, you create a deeper level of polarization

43:11.240 --> 43:15.240
that is easily plucked up by some swaggering demagogue.

43:15.240 --> 43:19.680
And these people have been conned for many years now and in many ways are victims of

43:19.680 --> 43:24.600
Glenn Beck, people whose grievances were ignored by the Democratic Party and then co-opted

43:24.600 --> 43:25.600
by the right.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.280
Anyone who sees that the system is working for the rich and powerful should be a ready

43:29.280 --> 43:33.880
ally for the party demanding stronger social programs and higher taxes on the wealthy,

43:33.880 --> 43:38.200
but the power of charismatic charlatans like Glenn Beck symbolized in books like the Overton

43:38.200 --> 43:43.640
window has swept these people away, preying on ignorance and stoking racism to scapegoat

43:43.640 --> 43:46.120
immigrants and the left more broadly.

43:46.120 --> 43:48.200
That's the danger of a book like this one.

43:48.200 --> 43:54.800
Facts are woven into elaborate fantasies and con people into voting against their interests.

43:54.800 --> 43:57.560
This book was, uh, pretty rough.

43:57.560 --> 44:02.420
The sequel to this book is called The Eye of Moloch, and I'm not really super anxious

44:02.420 --> 44:04.860
to read it, but I don't know if people really want to see that.

44:04.860 --> 44:05.860
I might do it.

44:05.860 --> 44:09.540
There's another Glenn Beck novel I'd actually rather read instead, and I might do that one

44:09.540 --> 44:10.700
as well.

44:10.700 --> 44:14.460
The names you see scrolling up the screen are my lovely patrons.

44:14.460 --> 44:17.820
These patrons who not only get their name in the credits, they also get early access

44:17.820 --> 44:21.700
to my videos, which is a new reward that if you're interested in supporting me is available.

44:21.700 --> 44:25.300
There's also a download to my theme song, and that's it for now, but hey, if you were

44:25.300 --> 44:28.940
considering supporting me on Patreon, like all of these lovely people, you can head on

44:28.940 --> 44:34.020
over there and subscribe to the $5 tier because I'm just putting everything in there, I guess.

44:34.020 --> 44:37.740
You can't support me financially or just don't want to, that's totally fine.

44:37.740 --> 44:41.900
There are lots of free ways you can express your appreciation for my work by liking this

44:41.900 --> 44:45.580
video, subscribing if you haven't already, and ringing that bell if you want to make

44:45.580 --> 44:49.140
sure you're kept in the loop whenever I drop a new video.

44:49.140 --> 44:53.860
Also leave a comment below, tell me about how much you loved this book, or hated it,

44:53.860 --> 44:59.660
or maybe learned something about the effect of Glenn Beck on the body politic.

44:59.660 --> 45:03.780
If you have some extra affinity for me, you can always follow me on Twitter and just send,

45:03.780 --> 45:07.220
you know, positive vibes in my general direction.

45:07.220 --> 45:09.660
Thank you all for watching.
