1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,660
Two taboos in polite conversation have traditionally been talking about religion and talking about

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:05,660
politics.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:09,860
People get immediately heated, and it often isn't conducive to a pleasant, conflict-free

4
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:13,660
encounter, so it's easy to make a new friend and have no idea there's some kind of political

5
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:15,440
disagreement between the two of you.

6
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,960
But if you take an interest in politics, and if you clicked on this video, odds are you

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,020
do, it's something that will likely come up eventually.

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,340
And suddenly, this blissful ignorance of your friendship fades away, and you have to look

9
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:27,820
at the reality of your friendship in the eye.

10
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,500
In the past few years, friendships being damaged by political differences has become a recurring

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,960
topic in news media, and we often see media figures opining about political opinions costing

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:36,960
them friends.

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,600
In many cases, it's easy to feel sympathy for someone who has lost a friend, or understanding

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,200
when a person expresses anxiety as to why they keep their political affiliations hidden.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:50,100
But not all complaints about friendships being affected by politics are the same.

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:54,520
The rules for friendships vary, and I want to look at how these dynamics shift, both

17
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:59,480
for friendships in private, and for those of us who have friendships in public.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,460
In recent years, polling has shown people are increasingly less likely to have friends

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:05,000
with different political persuasions.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,360
According to a YouGov poll of American citizens, all three categories of voters – Democrats,

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,820
Republicans, and Independents – have become less likely to be friends with anyone who

22
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:17,840
has different political opinions, with Democrats showing the biggest change from 2016 to 2020.

23
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,080
A Pew Research poll changed the question slightly, instead asking supporters from each respective

24
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,200
side in the previous federal election if they have a few or no friends who supported

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,680
the opposite candidate.

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,680
Once again, both sides revealed very few of their friends supported the other's candidate,

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,680
if any at all.

28
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:37,200
In the UK, a similar poll was conducted by Ipsos, and the results were similar, although

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,560
this one dug a little deeper.

30
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,720
Much like the American polls, it showed that both the left and right found it difficult

31
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,080
to be friends with someone who had a different political affiliation, with those supporting

32
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,760
the left-wing Labour Party having more difficulty in being friends with those in the right-wing

33
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,000
Conservative Party.

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,560
When digging into this particular poll, though, the numbers reveal something interesting.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:57,800
The propositions asked on specific issues revealed that these divides are on significant

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,040
issues that are more than mere disagreements on public policy.

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,160
For example, participants were asked to agree or disagree with these two propositions.

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,680
It would be hard to be friends with someone who supports the expansion of transgender

39
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:14,920
rights in the UK, and it would be hard to be friends with someone who thinks transgender

40
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,080
rights have gone too far in the UK.

41
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,040
It's a much deeper question than asking what someone thinks is the appropriate tax

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,040
rate.

43
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,400
Since 2015, reports of transphobic hate crimes have quadrupled.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,800
According to Gallup, 1 in 4 trans people have been threatened with or experienced transphobic

45
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,800
violence.

46
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,320
1 in 3 UK employers are less likely to employ a trans person.

47
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,560
Almost half of trans people have a suicide attempt in their past.

48
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,840
So the state of trans rights in the UK are not great.

49
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,160
Hearing that the question in the Ipsos poll reveals not just someone's attitude towards

50
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:51,320
friendships across political lines, but how the assumption of political affiliation carries

51
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,960
with it an attitude towards the rights of trans people.

52
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,280
If someone believes trans rights have gone too far, it's a question that goes beyond

53
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,280
politics and it's the realm of whether or not you believe someone has the right to

54
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,240
publicly identify as the gender they understand themselves to be.

55
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,120
We can try to intellectualize this in terms of it being a debate, and some people might

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,120
enjoy doing that.

57
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,040
It may be easy enough for a cis person to be friends with someone who believes trans

58
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,720
rights have gone too far, even if it means constantly getting into arguments.

59
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,200
But for a trans person, these arguments can hit a lot harder when it's your own rights

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
being debated.

61
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,800
And there's so many other degrees of differences, such as a cis person who might be more passionate

62
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,600
about trans rights because a sister or brother is trans, or perhaps a trans person who can

63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,280
compartmentalize well enough to engage in that debate.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,640
But in the midst of all this rhetorical exercise, it should be understood that what's being

65
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,840
debated here are the rights of human beings, and that this debate being politicized doesn't

66
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,920
make it the same as other debates on policy issues.

67
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,000
This is much like debates around marriage equality, civil rights, voting rights, and

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
an endless number of issues that have been politicized, both in the past and present.

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,800
Someone who advocates against trans rights is, whether they know it or not, advocating

70
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
for bigotry.

71
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,180
While someone can choose to be friends with a bigot in their personal life, reducing this

72
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:02,020
disagreement to a political one is disingenuous.

73
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:07,760
That isn't to say all disagreements across political affiliations are questions of personal

74
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
rights.

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,560
Considering what sort of issues get politicized, I think it's an important distinction to

76
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,560
make.

77
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,700
Amidst all these discussions about friendships being affected by politics, disagreements

78
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,440
on issues like this reveal something far deeper as at play.

79
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,200
In late 2020, the New York Times asked students about relationships with people who have differing

80
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,640
political opinions.

81
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,520
Here are a few of the responses.

82
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:29,720
Some people that believe that politics shouldn't ruin relationships don't realize that at

83
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,360
times not caring about politics is a privilege.

84
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,920
If my friends or family members have huge differences in opinions from me, for example,

85
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,560
if they don't support Black Lives Matter, LGBTQ+, and women's rights, etc., then I

86
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,980
don't want to associate myself with them at all.

87
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:47,320
That is more than just politics, it's about people's basic human rights.

88
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,040
People's lives are more important than relationships.

89
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,680
As a queer woman, hearing that one of my friends supports Trump means that they support all

90
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,660
the discrimination and laws he has enacted against the LGBTQIA plus community, as well

91
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:02,800
as women, people of color, Native Americans, disabled people, etc.

92
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Usually if they're a friend, I open a dialogue and talk about my beliefs often with them,

93
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,940
trying to get them to understand what the facts are, what the other side is, and why

94
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,020
I feel that way.

95
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,360
If they're family, I tend to avoid them when I can.

96
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,980
If they change their mind and admit that supporting someone who doesn't see me as a human being

97
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:20,120
is wrong, then I will continue to have that relationship with them.

98
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,320
If they can't or refuse to listen, then our relationship will die.

99
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,520
I can't respect someone who doesn't respect me.

100
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,400
Whatever the response is determines how our relationship changes, whether we drift apart

101
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,080
or go closer together.

102
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,760
What I liked about these particular quotes is how they establish the importance of the

103
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,900
type of relationship being considered.

104
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,060
Not all friendships are equal, and a relationship with a family member is often much more meaningful

105
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,100
than a friendship.

106
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,020
In those cases, it becomes a real test as to how to maintain that relationship.

107
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,740
Opinions like these certainly aren't universal.

108
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:49,420
In the same article, some students offer different responses.

109
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:53,900
In my family, my father was a Republican and my mother is a Democrat, but my parents have

110
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,580
learned to not judge each other because of their political beliefs, but to accept each

111
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,240
other's opinions and be grateful they are able to agree to disagree.

112
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,780
This election was a great test for this way of thinking.

113
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,060
Writing came out victorious.

114
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,920
My father accepts that and moves on.

115
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,340
As simple as that sounded, it taught me something that I will use when I start to build important

116
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,860
relationships with people.

117
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,260
Don't judge people based on their political opinions or their opposing opinions.

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,900
Judge them for what they mean to you.

119
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:20,580
I actually think it's not important in the slightest to have similar political beliefs

120
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:21,580
to your friends and family.

121
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,260
Rather, I think it's important to have different beliefs and opinions in order to gain perspective

122
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
and educate yourself.

123
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:30,420
I come from an extremely divided family, where my parents are extremely Republican.

124
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,160
One sister is extremely liberal.

125
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,760
The other is fairly moderate, and I am moderate, leaning towards the left side.

126
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,200
Although our disagreements can get frustrating and feelings can be hurt, I am thankful that

127
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,480
I am able to have all perspectives and educate myself to the best of my ability in order

128
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:47,400
to create my own political beliefs and not just choose my position based on those who

129
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
surround me.

130
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,800
The real disparity between these attitudes regarding the intersection of friendship and

131
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:56,360
politics is not so much the idea valuing one over the other, but rather what someone considers

132
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,120
a political question.

133
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,120
Speaking to The Atlantic, Emily Van Dyne, a communication professor at the University

134
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,120
of Illinois, said,

135
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,860
"'Politics isn't just politics anymore.

136
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,280
Political identity now encompasses so many other things.

137
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,200
Our social identity, our morals, our values."

138
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,800
A casual friend whose incessant political rants may be easy enough to cut out of your

139
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,660
life, but it's a bit tougher when it's a parent who regularly complains about immigrants.

140
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,640
Some relationships can be formed around disagreement or argument, though this can sometimes reflect

141
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,360
the stakes in the relationship.

142
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,840
If politics are impacting how we form friendships, it might be worth stepping back to take a

143
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,360
look at how much value one places in that particular friendship.

144
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,280
Writing for Psychology Today, professor of psychology at George Mason University, Todd

145
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,360
B. Kashtan, outlined some basics of friendship.

146
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,360
1.

147
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,360
There is a goal of pleasure.

148
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,720
There is an expectation that both parties enjoy each other's company and show relatively

149
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,240
equal amounts of appreciation and enjoyment.

150
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,240
2.

151
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,240
There is a sense of duty.

152
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,400
There is an expectation that you will act in your friend's interests without being

153
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,600
forced to, without being told to, without being accountable.

154
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,600
3.

155
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,320
There is a high level of empathy.

156
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,840
There is an expectation that both parties will try to understand each other's perspective.

157
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:03,840
You will not always agree, but you put in the work to understand who they are, where

158
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,440
their motivations lie, and attempt to seek agreement when discord arises.

159
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,160
When all friendships possess all three qualities, they typically have at least two.

160
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,160
He then goes on.

161
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
4.

162
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,680
If you fear losing a friend or creating a turmoil in a relationship when being true

163
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:21,120
to yourself, then your relationship lacks two of the three features of a firm foundation.

164
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,120
Duty is missing.

165
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Empathy is missing.

166
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,400
A solid friendship does not exist.

167
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:28,920
When you are unable to reveal honest thoughts and feelings, then it becomes increasingly

168
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,640
improbable that a solid friendship could even form.

169
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,040
Although the article goes on to decry outspoken political testing as a means of determining

170
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,400
one's friends, the passage above does suggest that friendships, at least the more meaningful

171
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:45,080
ones, typically have an openness and honesty that would include not hiding one's politics.

172
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,200
So how does one navigate a friendship with someone who has different politics?

173
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,200
A number of articles have been produced exploring this very question.

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,640
If you've decided that this relationship is one you want to maintain, a recurring

175
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,880
theme is to engage calmly and with an attempt to understand the other side.

176
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,360
Research has shown that taking the perspective of the person you're talking to can lead

177
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,640
to a greater understanding of their position.

178
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,240
One exercise that's recommended is trying to write a narrative from the perspective

179
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,440
of the other person.

180
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,400
This can help create some empathy and lead to more productive conversations.

181
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,160
Listening and keeping a calm head can have a similar impact.

182
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,500
It also helps to give someone room to be more complex.

183
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,980
One bad political take may not mean someone can be easily slotted into a disastrous political

184
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,980
position.

185
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,820
There's also the very simple solution of just not talking about politics.

186
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,180
Making it one of those topics you simply don't touch with that person.

187
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,260
Like avoiding mentioning multi-level marketing scams around your Uncle Kevin so you can avoid

188
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,820
another sales pitch.

189
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,780
Everyone has to make choices for themselves as to what political lines they're okay

190
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
with their friends being on.

191
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:46,340
And while I encourage people to consider their choices carefully and not let themselves be

192
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:50,300
trapped in a friendship that harms them or discard one based on minor differences, I

193
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,140
think it's better to reserve judgment when it comes to who anyone chooses to be friends

194
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,740
with in private, particularly if that person is a stranger.

195
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,980
So if you're someone in that position, I don't think it's fair for anyone who doesn't

196
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,700
know you to judge you on who you choose to be friends with.

197
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:08,540
I would just express that I hope this friendship is something that makes you a more fulfilled

198
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,540
person.

199
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,340
This same outlook does not hold for public figures though.

200
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,300
With all the groundwork of discussing star-crossed political friendships in the real world, let's

201
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,580
now shift to something completely ridiculous.

202
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,940
The world of online personalities.

203
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:24,740
I'm sure everyone watching this has seen at least one video about parasocial relationships.

204
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,540
That is, the relationship between a content creator, like me, and my audience.

205
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,820
But what about the interplay between two different content creators?

206
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,940
Or for our purposes, two content creators who engage in political commentary on different

207
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,060
sides of the political spectrum?

208
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,220
There are a couple of different ways political commentators strictly interact with one another

209
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,340
here on YouTube.

210
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,980
For video essayists, such as myself, you often see other commentators make guest appearances,

211
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,580
typically reading quotes or excerpts from source material.

212
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,740
I've had people do them for me, and I've done more of them than I can count for other

213
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,740
people.

214
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,740
Attention all trespassers!

215
00:10:56,740 --> 00:11:00,820
I am the supreme serpent!

216
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,900
Less common is the collaboration.

217
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,220
Two or more creators work on a video or videos that are available for one or more of their

218
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,380
respective channels.

219
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,700
I don't do much of these myself, though I recently worked on one with Mexie about a

220
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:27,100
very special babysitting club.

221
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,300
You might also see two creators interacting on a stream.

222
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:35,020
This is where things get a bit more complicated, as there are a lot of ways this can go down.

223
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,660
Someone might appear as part of a panel, it might be a one-on-one chat, sometimes it can

224
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,660
be confrontational.

225
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,340
I don't stream too much myself, so I have less experience with this one, but here is

226
00:11:43,340 --> 00:12:01,820
an example of what streams are like.

227
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,260
Outside of YouTube, you might see creators interact in other mediums, like Twitter, like

228
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:08,180
when I make a sick dunk and people acknowledge my brilliance.

229
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:12,460
There are even some very rare moments when content creators beat in the real world as

230
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,300
part of a public-facing event.

231
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:17,980
As an example, in Toronto, myself and some other political content creators have hosted

232
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,700
meetups where we interact with members of our audience.

233
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,620
A fun bit of Jose trivia is that at the last one we did, that was in February 29th of 2020,

234
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:29,060
I recorded the opening moments to my Married with Children video.

235
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:33,260
Friends, I'm gonna need a boost to get through this video.

236
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,260
Can I get a Whoa Jose?

237
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:42,420
Okay, so those are five different examples of how content creators on YouTube interact.

238
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:45,220
And there's one thing, to varying degrees, they all have in common.

239
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,620
They are all performative.

240
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:50,300
Let me clarify what I mean by performative.

241
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,940
I don't mean presenting some kind of false front.

242
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,620
Many of these moments can be authentic.

243
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,340
Rather, I mean these appearances are done very much with the knowledge that they are

244
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,200
in front of an audience.

245
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:04,300
Some of these may or may not be actual friendships people are witnessing.

246
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:07,620
What they do have the appearance, though, is of a friendly relationship between the

247
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,620
people in question.

248
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:12,220
To someone in the audience, they are watching a performance of friendship.

249
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,020
When someone makes a decision to appear on another person's video or stream, or engages

250
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,860
with them on social media or in the real world, it's with the awareness that people are paying

251
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,540
attention to how they interact.

252
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:25,300
Displays of kindness or hostility signal to the audience what sort of relationship these

253
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,300
people have.

254
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:30,100
And to some degree, will inform that audience on how to engage with this other creator's

255
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
content.

256
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:35,420
If I ask someone to a guest voice on my channel, it signifies to my audience that this is another

257
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:40,200
creator I approve of, and that perhaps they should give this person's content a chance.

258
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,740
On the other hand, if I reply to a tweet telling someone that they're clueless and should

259
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,660
try washing their disgusting beanie, it signals to my audience that this is a person you probably

260
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
shouldn't listen to.

261
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:53,020
A lot of this plays on the parasocial relationships that are formed by people watching online

262
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
content.

263
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,660
Just to quickly sum up, a parasocial relationship is a one-way relationship in which a viewer

264
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,540
feels attached to a presenter who has no knowledge of the viewer's personal life.

265
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:05,460
Even though it's only one-way to someone watching, it can feel like they have a virtual

266
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,460
friend.

267
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:10,180
When it comes to a viewer watching these performative friendships, it gets more complicated.

268
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:13,040
It's like being in a parasocial relationship with multiple people.

269
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,360
Or in other words, it's like being in a parasocial friend group.

270
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,060
This is a pattern we've already seen on the right wing on YouTube.

271
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,900
Rebecca Lewis's alternative influence paper demonstrated how different creators appearing

272
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,560
on different platforms can create a shared audience.

273
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:29,340
With the assistance of the U2 algorithm, the impact becomes even greater.

274
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:33,820
As much as we might like to pretend we as content creators exist on our soul little

275
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,540
islands not connected to anyone else, we all have audiences that overlap.

276
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,960
And a paper like this is a reminder that we exist in community structures, and that there

277
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:48,060
are very real risks of radicalization not just of our audiences, but of our own content.

278
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:52,520
And who you choose to befriend on your channel pushes your audience, and sometimes your content,

279
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,560
in certain political directions.

280
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,440
While not all creators are necessarily conscious of this performance, although some certainly

281
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,000
are, the results to the audience are the same.

282
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,600
Positive interactions encourage an audience to be more positive to the person being interacted

283
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,920
with, and negative ones do the opposite.

284
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,040
When we step into the world of friendships across the political aisle, we can see how

285
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,200
this becomes more complicated for anyone engaging in political commentary online.

286
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,800
If someone is on the left, and supposedly championing left-wing ideas or policies, and

287
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:24,200
then publicly engages in a friendly way with someone on the right, a performance of friendship,

288
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,480
it's considerable to their audience that this person should be considered positively

289
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,480
as well, and if this behavior becomes a pattern, it can be counterproductive to whatever left-wing

290
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,520
goals the commentator has in mind.

291
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,240
This isn't to say someone on the left should never be friendly with someone on the right,

292
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,960
but it's important to consider the broadest social context of these interactions.

293
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,520
If I were to appear on the channel of someone I disagree with, that could present a shift

294
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,720
in the algorithm, one that's more powerful than the luck of one of my videos showing

295
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
up as a recommendation.

296
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:52,840
But as lovely as it may be for everyone to stop watching PragerU and instead one of my

297
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,000
videos, it can backfire as well.

298
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,120
Let's use a recent example.

299
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,540
Figures supposedly on the left, such as Jimmy Dore and Glenn Greenwald, have regularly appeared

300
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:05,760
on Tucker Carlson's program over the years having friendly, cordial interviews.

301
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:09,440
This type of interaction is complicated as there is value in grabbing the attention of

302
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,160
a right-wing audience and steering them towards your left-wing content, but when your supposed

303
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,280
loving content largely consists of ignoring the right and attacking the party, that's

304
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
to the left of them.

305
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:22,320
Perhaps, in an effort to satisfy this right-wing audience that has been introduced to you in

306
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,920
a friendly manner, you have to ask the question what sort of project this is furthering.

307
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,880
You can claim you're not trying to help the right, but this display of friendship

308
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:33,360
and absence of right-wing critique ends up with clips like these.

309
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:55,280
Well, I can't say I know the metrics of Jimmy Dore's channel.

310
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:59,320
I'd wager he has a higher percentage of people who enjoy Tucker Carlson than mine, or most

311
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,740
other left-wing channels.

312
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:04,940
And I suspect they aren't going there to hear Jimmy Dore's left-wing ideals, but

313
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:08,860
rather to see him beat up on their political rivals, the Democrats.

314
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,460
Being friendly on someone else's platform, while still producing content that makes clear

315
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:16,540
that someone is not a part of the right, would complicate someone's public profile.

316
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:20,060
And I'm not going to pretend I understand the most effective way to thread that political

317
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,060
needle.

318
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,100
But in many cases, if someone is invited onto another platform, friendly conversation typically

319
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:26,700
implies friendly content.

320
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:30,620
Frequently, you might see a commentator lament that they are being critiqued for their

321
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:34,860
associations and no one should ever be written off for one association or appearance or

322
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:38,080
other incident without comparing it to their full body of work.

323
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,700
But when it becomes a pattern and is reflected in their content, it brings into question

324
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,340
how committed someone is to whatever political affiliation they claim to have.

325
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,220
It also displays a stunning ignorance, as if this is just a question about private friendships.

326
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,740
The details about cross-political friendships I outlined for private people is still true

327
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,000
for anyone with a public profile.

328
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,040
Just because someone has a YouTube channel doesn't give anyone the right to judge or

329
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,380
police their private life.

330
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:04,640
But when those relationships are with a content creator who has a public profile, they need

331
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,220
to be aware that who they engage with on friendly terms sends a message to their audience, whether

332
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,300
they want it to or not, and whether they think it should or not.

333
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:17,060
If I started live-strafing with, for example, Alex Jones, and we were chummy and cordial,

334
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:20,860
or if I had him read some quotations for one of my videos and never challenged him on his

335
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:25,140
ridiculous conspiracy theories, it would, to varying degrees, signal to my audience

336
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,900
that I think Alex Jones is someone who can be welcomed into public discourse, and that

337
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:32,000
his ideas may not be as toxic to the public square as they are.

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,820
And that would work directly against my own goals of pointing out how certain commentators

339
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,380
should never be taken seriously.

340
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:40,500
And in the case of Alex Jones, listening to him to learn about the world is a waste of

341
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,100
time and brain cells.

342
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,760
And I feel like I have to say this again, I'm not saying one should never be friendly

343
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,860
with someone who disagrees with you politically.

344
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:51,860
If there was a moderate conservative who disagreed with me on some issues, such as whether or

345
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,260
not healthcare should cover dental, that's someone I wouldn't be too bothered being

346
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,540
friendly with in public in a performative way.

347
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,220
But by being friendly with someone who spreads racist pseudoscience or climate change denialism,

348
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:05,860
or is just a complete asshole, I would be signaling to my audience that their presence

349
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:10,380
in the political discourse, and by extension their extreme content, should be considered,

350
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,420
to some degree, acceptable.

351
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:15,780
And that's not something I'm going to do.
