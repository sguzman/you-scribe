22000	27040	In 2016, conservative commentator and guy who will absolutely not go to any gay barbecues,
27040	32240	Ben Shapiro decided he would take a break from penning an endless series of books about how to
32240	37040	own the left with facts and logic, and decided to try his hand at writing some fiction.
37040	43520	The title of his first original novel is True Allegiance. This is not a good book.
43520	48720	Do not buy or read it. And now with that disclaimer out of the way, let's get started.
48720	53760	The first thing that a person sees when opening up this book is a terrific cell phone. The very
53760	60560	first page includes praise for the book, including this quote from Salon. Meet our new Ayn Rand.
60560	66320	Of course, the full quote actually reads, Meet our new Ayn Rand. Ben Shapiro's hand-fisted
66320	72320	propaganda fiction is even worse than you guessed. But it's actually even worse than that. Even though
72320	77840	the book calls it praise for true allegiance, this article was published in 2015, a year before True
77840	83120	Allegiance was released. The author was actually taking a shot at Ben Shapiro's short story
83120	88640	collection titled What's Fair that was published digitally that year. The rest of the accolades
88640	94400	come from conservative fixtures and a few creative types. Here's a brief sample. It's prophetic.
95280	102320	Just a little too real for comfort. Is it really fictional? Yes to that last one. That's how
102320	106480	novels work. But to address the other comments, the opening pages of this book are trying very
106480	112320	hard to convince us that this book describes a plausible depiction of the real world. I want
112320	118640	you to think about that as we go through its plot. This is a tough book to read. Particularly
118640	124000	in public, you have to hold it in just such a way that no one can tell you're reading a book by Ben
124000	128800	Shapiro. The actual prose is a lot easier to grasp. The novel is split into three parts,
128800	134080	with chapters divided amongst five central characters, although Ben breaks this rule drifting
134080	140080	to other characters all the time. The main character is Brett Hawthorne. And yes, I do need
140080	146160	to say it like that. Brett Hawthorne is the youngest general in US history at 41. He spends
146160	150560	most of this novel murdering terrorists and getting angry at those damn liberals who would
150560	157040	rather send them winter coats. Our next major character is President Mark Prescott. He's a
157040	161680	president obsessed with how he's perceived in the media, and he's trying to appease the American
161680	167440	population by bringing the troops back home and going massively into debt to China to pay for work
167440	174400	programs. He's generally a cowardly guy. He's also a thinly veiled combination of Barack Obama
174400	180320	and Bill Clinton. Our next major character is Ellen Hawthorne, Brett's wife. Ellen does
181120	186240	something working for the governor of Texas. I think she's an aide for him. It's really hard
186240	191200	to tell because she goes from photographing dead children at the border to leading the National
191200	196800	Guard, and then she's suddenly like a proxy for the governor. I really don't know what her
196800	203520	specific title is. She just does whatever the plot needs her to do. Next we've got Soledad Ramirez.
203520	208640	She runs a ranch that falls on hard times when the EPA shuts down access to a river to protect
208640	213680	a threatened species. It prevents her from watering her cattle and destroys her ranch,
213680	219680	so she resorts to terrorism. This is an obvious nod to the Cliven Bundy story of a few years back
219680	224080	when ranchers took over a government building because he wanted to keep using land stolen from
224080	230560	the government. Our last character is, brace yourself for this one, Levon Williams, a drug dealer
230560	235680	from Detroit who hustles his way into a civil rights movement that's a stand-in for Black Lives
235680	242400	Matter. If there's one character who will just drive you up a wall with the naked racism of it,
242400	248480	it's Levon, so look forward to that. And so there we have our principal cast, three protagonists
248480	254480	and two antagonists. The book opens with a prologue that takes us into the story in Media Reyes.
254480	258880	It's a scene from further along in the story where the George Washington Bridge is collapsing
258880	263040	after a terrorist bombing. Leaving that aside from now, let's go to the first chapter where
263040	268400	Brett Hothorn is stationed in Afghanistan, which is quickly falling into the hands of the Taliban
268400	272880	after the feckless left-wing President Prescott decided to pull out the majority of the troops.
272880	278240	As Kabul crumbles around him, we learn about Brett's backstory. We find out he has a friend
278320	282720	named Derek who taught him how to get out of scraps using his wits instead of fighting.
282720	286240	Fun fact about the rest of this book, every scrap Brett gets into,
286240	290880	he escapes by beating up or murdering the other person. We don't hear from his buddy Derek,
290880	296000	who the book is quick to tell us is his black friend, until much later on when we find out
296000	300880	he grew up to become a plot device. Brett and Ellen have a special way of saying goodbye to one
300880	307360	another. Take a bullet for you babe. I shuddered every time I had to read that.
307360	311600	Back in the United States we meet President Prescott. He's recently come up with a new
311600	317120	governmental program called the Work Freedom Program to get Americans working again. Here's
317120	322800	a fun fact that I'm sure is just a coincidence. One of the campaign slogans the Nazis used in the
322800	329200	1930s was work, freedom, and bread. The phrase comes up from a 19th century German novel,
329760	335600	Arbeit Mach Frei. Where criminals attained freedom through work, it was also the phrase
335600	341760	emblazoned on the gates to concentration camps. I think Ben is trying to suggest something here
341760	348560	by having the president create a Work Freedom Program. As Prescott delivers his speech we meet
348560	354240	Soledad, who has decided to take the impending doom of her ranch into her own hands when she
354240	359440	hires someone to bomb a U.S. federal building. The woman who bombed an office belonging to the
359440	364720	U.S. government is a hero, but the Taliban soldiers who bombed the U.S. embassy in Kabul
364720	370720	two chapters ago are villains. It's strange to see a book use such frightening morality that
370720	376080	justifies actions on the basis of the one performing them, but here we are. Soledad,
376080	380640	captive in her ranch, is surrounded by law enforcement who would easily arrest this
380640	386880	one 50-something-year-old lady except that there are dozens of biker ranchers surrounding them,
386880	391840	ready to die for Soledad. I guess they're ready to just go to war with the cops, okay.
391840	397680	Next we go to Detroit to meet Levon, who's got a fancy crack operation because Ben's knowledge of
397680	403520	black culture is from movies from the 1970s and 80s. Levon meets Jim Crawford, a civil rights
403520	408640	leader who takes Levon under his wing after Levon poorly quotes Hamlet. Jim responds,
409360	415760	quoting dead honkies, you might be useful yet. Ben thinks that's what black people talk like.
416720	421760	Then, in the same chapter, we cut away to a new character, Officer Ricky O'Sullivan,
421760	427600	who is confronted by a young boy named Kendrick Malone late at night. Apparently, this boy was
427600	431760	just wandering around the streets of Detroit in the middle of the night. I can't describe the
431760	436960	madness of this scene, so let me just read some of it. As a bit of context, O'Sullivan thinks
436960	441280	Kendrick has a gun concealed in his pants, but at this point he can't see it.
442080	448000	Fuck you, honky. The kid shot back. Get the fuck out of my neighborhood. Then he laughed,
448000	453840	a cute kid's laugh. O'Sullivan looked for sympathy behind those eyes. Found none.
454640	461520	Oh shit, O'Sullivan thought. Then he said, hands up, right now. It goes on like this for a little
461520	467280	while, but later on the scene. You go home, white boy, said the kid. His hand moved lower.
468000	474240	Suddenly, O'Sullivan's head filled with a sudden clarity, his brain with a preternatural energy.
474240	479440	He recognized the feel of the adrenaline hitting. He wasn't going to get shot in the corner of Iowa
479440	483920	and Van Dyke outside a shitty convenience store and in a shitty town by some eight-year-old,
483920	489680	bleed out in the gutter of some city the world left behind. He had a life too. The gun felt alive
489680	497440	in his hand. The gun was life. Yeah, that's right. The kid is eight. As you might have guessed,
497440	503120	this ends with the cop murdering the child. And after he realizes he just shot a child who was
503120	509360	holding a toy gun, not a real one, we get this line. When he looked up, he saw them coming.
510080	517200	Dozens of them. The citizens of Detroit coming out of the darkness, congregating. He could feel
517200	523600	their eyes. Soledad's chapter also ended with people surrounding law enforcement, but in that
523600	529120	case, it was the heroic biker ranchers surrounding the cruel cops who were trying to arrest this
529120	534400	harmless woman who bombed a government building. In this chapter, it's a bunch of scary black
534400	539120	people surrounding this innocent cop whose only crime was murdering an eight-year-old.
539760	545920	I would almost think that this symmetry was intentional. I'm not sure Ben is that clever,
545920	550800	unless he was trying to expose his ridiculous bias here. This is Ben's way of showing us who
550800	555280	the good people are and who the bad people are. It underscores what I mentioned earlier. Their
555280	560240	actions aren't material. It's their identity that will inform who we should consider a protagonist
560240	566240	and who we should consider an antagonist. And next, we finally meet Brett's wife, Ellen. The
566240	570320	chapter we meet her in is boring, but it establishes that she works for Governor
570320	575600	Bubba Davis of Texas and that there are drug dealers arriving in Texas by helicopter and
575600	580800	they murder one of Ellen's friends. And this plot point doesn't have any lasting ramifications
580800	586080	aside from letting us know that the border is soft and under threat by Mexico. I mean,
586080	590880	drug dealers, right? It's drug dealers who are coming across the border, sure.
590880	596720	Ben is cramming a lot of topics into this story. I'd say way too many for 266 pages,
596720	603440	but who am I to disagree with the cool kid's philosopher? Back in Afghanistan, Brett Hawthorne
603520	607840	finds out that the US has been betrayed by the US ambassador to Afghanistan. Apparently,
607840	612720	this guy was a big donor to the Prescott campaign and he was rewarded with becoming
612720	617680	ambassador to Afghanistan. Honestly, that sounds more like a punishment than anything else.
617680	621920	Maybe this is why he betrayed America. We never really get an answer to the question of why he
621920	627360	betrayed America. The plot point is pretty much dropped after this revelation. It's a brief
627360	633040	scene where Brett opens the ambassador's briefcase, finding a map with two sets of coordinates,
633040	638480	one set in Iran and one set in Iraq. And from there, he somehow figures out the ambassador
638480	645760	sold Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction to Iran. I'm not sure how I figured this one out.
645760	652400	He just kind of did. Ben also helpfully rewrote history by giving Saddam Hussein nuclear weapons
652400	656960	he never had. I don't know why he couldn't just pretend it was chemical weapons that were never
656960	661360	found, but Saddam had nukes in this story. Whatever. After that, Brett gets captured
661360	667040	by some terrorists. Governor Bubba Davis gets a lengthy introduction. We find out that the
667040	672080	governor was once a big player in the oil industry and then he ran for office when he found out the
672080	677440	Environmental Protection Agency was threatening the production of oil. It's amazing how a rich
677440	683840	oil tycoon running for office to protect his own business is presented as some kind of hero in this
683840	688880	book. It seems like there's a problem with the system if a rich person can afford to run for
688880	694080	office when their money is at threat. Here's a passage from the book describing Bubba's campaign.
694800	699600	In his opening campaign speech, he named the three top environmental officers in the state and read
699600	704400	off how much they'd received from lobbyists from the environmentalists and how much those
704400	708720	environmental groups received from global competitors like the Saudi government.
709920	715440	Why would Saudi Arabia, which makes its money off of oil, want to finance people
715440	722560	protested against oil? Or these environmentalists specifically against American oil? Typically,
722560	728880	they argue for green energy and getting off oil entirely. It doesn't make sense. Even when Ben
728880	734160	is writing fiction, his conspiracy theories don't seem believable. Also, this scene of an angry Bubba
734160	740480	reminded me of something. Well, go fuck yourself then, he sputtered slamming the phone down on his
740480	748320	carefully crafted maple desk. He looked up. Oh, hey Ellen, glad you're back. I did not hit her.
748320	755200	It's not true. It's bullshit. I did not hit her. I did not. Oh, hi Mark. Back with Soledad,
755200	760800	she's eventually spirited away from her ranch by Aiden Foster, formerly in law enforcement. Aiden
760800	766640	just couldn't stomach being on that side anymore. And oh god, here we go back and leave on story.
766640	772000	We find out that the recently murdered eight-year-old Kendrick was actually sent there by
772000	778000	Levon and Jim so they could manufacture a story about the cops shooting a kid. Yeah,
778640	784720	that's really how it happened. Ben has given us the most ghoulish black activists I've seen in
784720	791680	a book in a very long time. A large group of, as the book puts it, mostly young black men
791680	797040	start protesting. Levon, who is apparently a master of manipulating the media, tricks them
797040	801600	into covering the story from the angle that the shooting of an eight-year-old kid is wrong.
801600	806160	I'm not sure you need to trick the media into believing that a child getting shot by a cop is
806160	811920	a bad thing, but that's how this novel frames it. Ben introduces a new character who gets a focal
811920	817360	point chapter just for this one time only. He's a terrorist from the Middle East and you better
817360	823600	believe his name is Muhammad. In Muhammad's story, we also meet Ibrahim Ashami, a bin Laden-like
823600	829600	figure who, in spite of being a sloughest terrorist, is somehow being supported by Iran.
829600	834960	Considering how much ISIS and Iran are at odds with one another, this is a stretch. It's supposed to
834960	839760	be showing readers that theocratic Muslims will put aside their differences when it comes to
839760	844800	fighting against America. This reads into a broader paranoia about Muslims, that they will
844800	850400	one day create a universal alliance and start attacking the West. It's a grotesque caricature
850400	855920	of Muslims and Islam in general, and it's also exactly what Osama bin Laden was trying to do on
855920	861200	9-11. By having the US respond violently in the Middle East, he was hoping all Muslims would unite
861200	868160	together and team up to fight America. And 18 years later, it's pretty obvious that he failed.
868160	873600	We also get this line, where Muhammad is sitting in a cafe in Tehran and getting very frustrated.
873680	878800	He was getting sick of listening to the Western-style, sinful music blasting over the speakers.
879520	885200	What, he asked himself, does it mean to hit me baby one more time?
885840	891200	So I guess in Iran, music is over 20 years out of date, and pretty neat that they, I guess,
891200	895840	can play American music right there in public. Muhammad picks up a nuke from a Russian guy,
895840	899920	which is weird because I thought it was the American ambassador to Afghanistan who was
899920	905280	hooking them up with Saddam Hussein's nukes, unless this ambassador was also working for Russia.
905280	909680	It's never really explained because Russia's involvement and the ambassador, all this stuff,
909680	914160	is just sort of forgotten about. Brett is in the hands of Ashami, and we get a terrible
914160	918800	comeback line when Brett, after hearing America get talk-town to by Ashami, says,
918800	922240	we live for something. We live to kill bastards like you.
922960	928320	Most of Brett's lines read like this one. While captive, Brett sees a landmark through an open
928320	934080	window and somehow figures out not only is he in Tehran, but that he must be at the same coordinates
934080	938320	on the map he found in the briefcase. I don't know how he puts that one together. Brett is
938320	942960	filmed in a hostage video, and he sends a message back to America by blinking in Morse code.
942960	948480	This was first done in 1966 by Jeremiah Denton when he spelled out torture while describing his
948480	954720	captivity in Vietnam. Ben even describes it in this book. While Denton only blinked out torture,
955360	962640	Brett manages to blink out Airstrike Now, 514231 356961.
963440	968080	Somehow the terrorists don't notice one of the most famous examples of an American sending a
968080	972320	secret message back home, or that he's blinking really weirdly for three minutes.
972320	977440	Also, those coordinates are in the middle of Tehran, so to kill Ashami, Brett is gasking
977440	982800	the president to launch an airstrike on the capital city of Iran. This would start a war
982800	987920	killing hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people, but in Brett's mind that's worth it to
987920	993280	get one terrorist. Because Prescott isn't a complete maniac, he decides to send in a special
993280	998560	forces team instead. Except he waited four days, letting Ashami slip through their fingers,
998560	1002800	and Brett apparently didn't need that team to save him anyway because even though he's got a
1002800	1007440	broken arm and he's been awake for two days straight, he's able to murder both of his guards
1007440	1012160	and escape. And on the way out, he saves the team that had come to rescue him, because the building
1012160	1016560	has been set up to explode, and he just sort of hauls them out of there. I'm not sure why the
1016560	1021280	building exploded, or why there were only two guards though. The terrorists can't afford recruits,
1021280	1026240	but they can afford extra bombs for all their buildings. Brett knows Mohammed is heading to
1026240	1030560	America for another attack. He doesn't tell the president because he thinks he's a giant wimp,
1030560	1035200	so he decides to solve this problem alone. In the wake of all these events, we finally get the
1035200	1040400	bombing of the George Washington Bridge from way back in the prologue. Back in Texas, Governor
1040400	1044800	Davis is using the National Guard to patrol the border, which is, from the book's perspective,
1044800	1048880	working really nicely by turning the southern part of Texas into a police state. It's a bit
1048880	1053520	frightening how often this book talks about how nice it is to have armed military personnel
1053520	1059040	everywhere. Since the president hates America, he's annoyed by safety at the border. But Baba
1059040	1067040	doesn't care. He's just a Texas badass. Ben loves his characters. In Detroit, Levon is unveiling his
1067040	1072320	master plan to get the city to bow to the will of his angry black man mob so he can start making
1072320	1077920	reforms to the police system. He wants an all-black police force, and this apparently means they'll
1077920	1084560	have to have lower education standards and allow in more criminals. Gee, I wonder what Ben is saying
1084560	1089760	about the black community here. We're getting a caricature of a civil rights leader in the making,
1089760	1094800	and it's being used to make a broader point about the black community. It's not the legacy of racism
1094800	1098720	that's held them back, but the evil people who take advantage of the community's
1098720	1104880	rage and loose moral character. They seem like the violent and angry community easily led astray by
1104880	1111200	the worst members inside of it. Unless you doubt his expertise, Ben has intimate knowledge of the
1111200	1117120	black community. Remember this line from earlier on? Quoting dead honkies, you might be useful yet.
1117680	1123680	Thanks to a Republican district attorney, the officer who shot the child won't be charged,
1123680	1130320	and people are getting angrier. Back in the US, Brett is trying to track down Muhammad,
1130320	1134640	and we get a cringy scene where Ben Shapiro reveals he doesn't understand what racial
1134640	1139520	profiling is. In this scene, a Port Authority security guy is refusing to help Brett racial
1139520	1145280	profile records of people entering the US. Look, Brett burst out, losing his patience.
1145920	1150800	I don't give a rat's ass at this point whether it's racial profiling or not. Maybe you're right,
1150800	1156160	maybe Muhammad is a light-skinned Norwegian woman or a Cherokee elder, or maybe he's a Persian or
1156160	1161280	Arabic-looking son of a bitch who hangs out with other Persian or Arabic-looking sons of bitches
1161280	1167040	who look like Ibrahim Ashami. If I end up being wrong and he looks like Helen Mirren, feel free
1167040	1172800	to tell the New York Times editorial board about it. At this point in the story, Brett has a physical
1172800	1180000	description of Muhammad. In an earlier scene, he describes him. He's about 5'9", 140", skinny,
1180000	1187280	maybe 17 years old, blue eyes, angular face, sharp, big nose. So if he knows he's looking
1187280	1192480	for an Arabic guy and has such a specific description, how is that racial profiling?
1193120	1199040	Racial profiling is questioning people on the basis of their race, not targeting a specific
1199040	1204000	person whose ethnicity you know and who you have reason to believe will commit a crime.
1204000	1208800	Maybe Brett is worried about a fake name, but looking up an Arabic man that he has already
1208800	1213760	seen makes perfect sense. It's the difference between stopping someone on the street because
1213760	1218480	they look like someone who is trying to commit a crime and stopping someone on the street because
1218480	1223040	they belong to a certain ethnic group that you just happen to believe commits crimes.
1223760	1229200	You have a crime which you have evidence is going to occur versus an imagined crime that you think
1229200	1233920	might occur because that racial group is always responsible for crimes. You see the difference
1233920	1240640	now. Ben, I suspect, doesn't. We also finally get to hear from Brett's best friend Derek. Remember
1240640	1245920	him? Well, he's not just your token good black guy, he's also your token Muslim because he goes
1245920	1251920	by Hassan Abdul. And what makes him a good Muslim, you ask? Well, he infiltrates mosques and informs
1251920	1256560	on other Muslims to the government. His role in this book is to hand off some information to Brett
1256560	1263040	and then get murdered because he's just a plot device, not a character. Bubba Davis sends Ellen
1263040	1267520	to parlay with the president as Prescott demands the National Guard be taken from the border to
1267520	1272400	help the cleanup in New York City after the bridge was bombed. On Soledad's side of things, we find
1272400	1278240	out that her new right-hand man, Aidan, is childhood friends with Ricky O'Sullivan, the cop who shot the
1278240	1283040	eight-year-old black child. So now the threads are coming together as Soledad's team decides to head
1283040	1288400	to Detroit to rescue Ricky. Their plan is kind of weird. They're going to have the biker ranchers
1288400	1294080	drive into the middle of the angry mob, which has congregated outside the prison Ricky is currently
1294080	1299520	staying in. The biker ranchers will start a fight and as things turn violent they'll sneak Ricky out
1299520	1306000	in the confusion. While this is going on, Levon has Jim, his civil rights mentor, murdered, leaving
1306000	1311920	Levon in control of the movement. Remember Ashami, the terrorist who's apparently the mastermind
1311920	1315920	behind all these attacks? You might as well forget about him because we found a new Muslim leader who
1315920	1320800	will be the focus for the rest of this book. Muhammad and his nuke have hooked up with an
1320800	1327600	imam named Omari, who runs a major mosque in the US. Omari has close ties to the president because
1327600	1333520	of course the left-wing president is unknowingly friends with a terrorist. The president is bending
1333520	1338320	to all of Levon's requests, like letting him influence the police department, not just in
1338320	1343280	Detroit, but eventually in cities across the US. And now I'm just going to skip ahead to the end of
1343280	1348400	Levon's story here because from this point on nothing really happens. He becomes more powerful
1348400	1353120	and he gets everything he wants because the president is afraid of being called a racist.
1353120	1358800	I'll have more to say about Levon later on. Soledad is finding more people deserting her
1358800	1364640	terrorist cell and soon the only ones left are her, Aiden, and Officer Ricky. The last biker to
1364640	1371280	leave them is a guy named Ezekiel, who then helpfully lets us know is black and this guy betrays
1371280	1375520	them. He's secretly been working with the US government and he gives a scarf with a tracking
1375520	1381440	device implanted on it to Soledad. It's also strange that he's the only biker whose race is
1381440	1387840	explicitly mentioned, just a detail I noticed. Soledad gives that bugged scarf to Aiden and it's
1387840	1394000	in his hands when the president, you know, the feckless coward who would have tea with a terrorist
1394000	1399680	decides to order a drone strike on American soil. Personally I think it would be easier to just
1399680	1403760	arrest three people who are driving around on motorcycles but I guess the drone is, uh,
1404560	1409360	I don't know, doesn't make sense. Since Aiden is the one holding the tracking device,
1409360	1414080	the operation is botched and it's Aiden who's killed when Soledad was originally the main
1414080	1420800	target. This brutal murder hardens Soledad, so much so that she's decided she needs to assassinate
1420800	1426560	the president. She's still supposed to be one of the heroes by the way. Back with Brett. He's now
1426560	1431520	running around with the evidence from his now dead best friend that Omari is working with
1431520	1437040	Muhammad and they secretly are going to plan some sort of terrorist attack in New York City.
1437040	1442080	All while Brett is trying to stay one step ahead of the president's goons. I guess the president
1442080	1445920	wouldn't want to know about an impending terror attack because he's friends with the guy
1445920	1450960	perpetrating it. Ellen arrives in New York trying to find her husband and we learn that Muhammad
1450960	1455840	wasn't in New York to bomb the George Washington Bridge. He's actually part of a second bombing
1455840	1460960	plot, this one to detonate a nuke inside of New York City. From what I can gather, the plan
1460960	1465600	was to set off one large bomb in New York City on the George Washington Bridge. Then the president
1465600	1470000	would call back the military from Afghanistan to help with the cleanup and then with all that
1470000	1475760	military personnel concentrated they would detonate a second bomb to kill everyone. In this case the
1475760	1480800	bomb would be a nuke. Generally speaking I think detonating a nuclear weapon inside of New York City
1480800	1485680	is going to be a knockout punch no matter what comes before it or how much military may or may
1485680	1490640	not be inside there. But I'm not the terrorist mastermind in a pen Shapiro novel so what do I
1490640	1495760	know? Amari is now the guy who's detonating the nuke and his plan is to do so during the president's
1495760	1501520	big speech in New York City where he's pushing his new work freedom program. Brett mindlessly
1501520	1506480	wanders through the crowd during the president's speech when he bumps into Soledad. He notices her
1506480	1511600	arm in her purse in a way that can only be understood as her secretly holding onto a gun.
1511600	1517200	I'm not kidding here's how Ben describes that in the book. He'd seen that arm angle before.
1517200	1521760	He knew what a person looked like before they pulled a gun from concealment. He could feel
1521760	1526560	the threat before he even knew he felt it. He could feel it before he felt it. That's just
1527200	1532960	ah that's good writing isn't it? Brett grabs Soledad. The gun goes off not shooting anyone and
1532960	1538480	Brett is the one who's tackled by the president's goon as Soledad just melts into the crowd. Brett
1538480	1544160	is placed under arrest and in that commotion Amari decided not to detonate the nuke. I'm not really
1544160	1548480	sure why he waited but the president decides to fly away with his inner circle that includes
1548480	1554320	Amari and Ellen who he's decided is now a hostage to use against Governor Bubba. As they're in the
1554320	1559440	air president Prescott decides to circle over New York City a few times for a pafoto op. Seizing on
1559440	1564800	this opportunity Amari is going to threaten to detonate the nuke. Ellen rises to the occasion
1564800	1570160	in this moment by confronting Amari when all the other passengers can't described in this
1570160	1575840	unbelievable line. The other passengers looked around uncomfortably paralyzed by a peculiar
1575840	1582160	inability to overcome their political correctness. That's right the passengers are too politically
1582160	1587920	correct to stop someone trying to detonate a bomb or maybe he wasn't trying to detonate a bomb.
1587920	1592560	Amari said he wanted to negotiate with Prescott to get some sort of concession but Ellen reacts
1592560	1598720	too quickly and instead she detonates the nuke. Instead of stopping the terrorist she does his
1598720	1604480	job for him and blows up a nuke over New York City and killing hundreds of thousands. The book tells
1604480	1609040	us it's only hundreds of thousands but the blast I guess would only kill that many. The fallout would
1609040	1613360	kill millions. I don't think Ben understands fallout because Brett is in New York City when
1613360	1620240	this happens and he somehow is fine. You wouldn't be if a nuclear bomb exploded over a city the
1620240	1626160	fallout would kill so many people. Well we already know Ben doesn't understand nukes right because
1626160	1631280	of this clip. President Trump wanted to nuke hurricanes which by the way I don't even care
1631280	1635840	whether it does anything it just sounds cool. Just the idea anytime you're talking about nuking
1635840	1640880	a random thing that's not really gonna hurt anybody I'll admit the 13 year old boy of me
1640880	1646320	is kind of for it. Oh god he's so dumb. I bet you didn't expect that plot twist though right?
1646320	1652320	Ben is ending his book by nuking New York City. But wait there's an epilogue in it we find out
1652320	1658080	that our new president is going to be former VP Allison Martin who for some reason we have not
1658080	1662960	heard about until now. She blames the nuke going off on Ellen which is more accurate than she
1662960	1668160	realizes but she thinks it was because Ellen was a suicide bomber sent by the governor of Texas
1668160	1673440	which is as good a pretense as any to lead the country into a civil war. We also get a glimpse
1673440	1679440	outside of the US borders where we find an international coalition led by China including
1679440	1686320	Europe, Japan, Canada and Russia who are launching a massive invasion of the United States. This comes
1686320	1691040	completely out of nowhere and makes no sense whatsoever. It's maybe the dumbest thing in this
1691040	1696960	book and it's a very competitive field and in the closing scene we see Brett rescued from prison by
1696960	1703200	Soledad and together they're going to start a new terror cell which means a sequel.
1706160	1711920	Some people use VPN for enhanced security and safety. Personally I use it for accessing
1711920	1716880	different parts of the internet that aren't accessible in my home country of Canada. One
1716880	1722480	of my favorite shows to watch on Netflix is Kim's Convenience. It's a really great Canadian show
1722480	1727920	about a Korean family that has a convenience store in my hometown of Toronto. It just finished up
1727920	1733360	its third season but if I go to Canadian Netflix you'll see there are only two seasons. Season
1733360	1739200	three is coming on October 2nd. Of course that's not the case for other Netflixes around the world
1739200	1744960	so what I can do is open up NordVPN and with a few quick clicks I can move IP address from Canada to
1744960	1750320	the United States or maybe maybe we'll wait to the next election before trying the United States.
1750320	1756400	Instead I'll move to where my family is from that's Spain and we just click there. Nord will
1756400	1761680	find the best server to make sure I've got decent latency so the stream comes in okay
1761680	1768560	and then it switches and there we are. So I go back to Netflix, I refresh the page
1769680	1777840	and boom three seasons and that's how I use NordVPN. As part of this sponsorship viewers of this video
1777840	1784960	can get a special 70% off a three-year plan at nordvpn.com slash Jose. This special offer makes
1784960	1792000	your subscription $3.49 per month which lets you browse on all sorts of devices and if you use the
1792000	1797600	code Jose that's J-O-S-E you'll get an extra month of Nord for free. This is also a way I think
1797600	1802640	viewers can support this channel and get a little something extra back as well so do click on that
1802640	1809600	link below if you're in need of a decent VPN. Style is very subjective. I'm a fan of simple
1809600	1815040	effective prose and some writers can use language so effortlessly you could read them writing about
1815040	1820720	anything. Ben Shapiro is not one of these writers. One of the things he does in this book that
1820720	1825920	constantly bugged me were these short little one sentence paragraphs. Here's how he ends one scene.
1825920	1832480	He glanced up at the face of the secret service agent on his back. A thick burn scar marked his
1832480	1838640	face near his ear. Then everything went black. The short sentences are meant to emphasize each
1838640	1843840	one. It's like writing in bold or under lighting the sentence except less obvious. Unless you do
1843840	1850400	it all the time and Ben uses this technique dozens of times. She felt tears well in her own eyes.
1850400	1857200	She couldn't cry. Not yet. So she went to work as usual. Ben also has a problem with starting so
1857200	1863760	many sentences particularly action scenes with the word then. Then without hesitating he stabbed
1863760	1868320	the boy through the eye. When he looked up he saw the explosives packed along the ceiling.
1869040	1875120	Then he noticed a camera operated by remote in the corner of the hallway. The annoying thing
1875120	1879440	about these sentences is that they're just as effective without the word then. This is what
1879440	1884160	they look like removed and they're fine. By constantly starting a sentence with then it
1884160	1888000	creates the impression that this story is being told to me by a child. And I want to give some
1888000	1892240	special consideration to the many names Ben has come up with for this novel. Here are some of my
1892240	1903760	favorites. Brett Hawthorne. Mark Prescott. Levon Williams. Ricky O. Sullivan. Bubba Davis. Jack
1903840	1917920	Blatch. Southers. Ibrahim Ashami. Jim Balaban. Bill Collier. Billy Barron. James Easton McLawrence.
1919040	1928400	Aidan Foster. Beauregard Feldkopf. And a special shout out to Jeff Jeffords, the soldier who's only
1928400	1933440	mentioned in one paragraph where we find out his head was cut off and sent to Governor Davis.
1933440	1937680	For anyone planning to write a book where gruesome decapitation happens, try not to give
1937680	1943680	the victim a silly name like Mark Markson or Bill Billson. One thing we get a lot of in this
1943680	1949680	266 page book is characters. Dozens of them. Many appearing for no more than a few paragraphs,
1949680	1954640	but what's most telling is how these characters are presented to us. Let's take the subplot of
1954640	1959280	Ricky O. Sullivan shooting the eight-year-old boy. The boy's name is Kendrick Malone, though we
1959280	1963440	don't even learn that until after he's been murdered. The scene where the two encounter one
1963440	1968880	another is told entirely from Ricky's perspective. We see the fear, doubt, and regret through his
1968880	1974320	eyes, creating sympathy for the character. We never get Kendrick's perspective. Part of that
1974320	1978880	may be because they were trying to hide that this was a setup, but even after he dies, we do meet
1978880	1985600	his mother, Regina Malone, who's briefly described as a slightly overweight black woman. And that's
1985600	1989840	about it. She's never a focal point. We never really learn anything about her aside that she's
1989840	1995680	being used as a prop by Levon and Jim. The Malone family, although victims in this narrative, are
1995680	2000320	without a story or perspective. They're just props being used to tell us the story of a sympathetic
2000320	2005360	police officer and two conniving civil rights frauds. When we find out Officer Ricky isn't
2005360	2010080	being charged with the crime of murdering a child, we get a brief rundown of the district attorney,
2010080	2014960	Kim Donahue. She's introduced as a straight-shooting Republican who got into office after her
2015040	2020000	Democratic competition dropped out of the race because of a sex and corruption scandal. Ben
2020000	2024000	tries to give her backstory so we can feel sympathy for her when Detroit's black community
2024000	2029760	is enraged by her decision to not press charges against Ricky. Ben has no interest in even trying
2029760	2034640	to present the grievances of black residents of Detroit. People are reduced to easily manipulated
2034640	2040800	props. We get no backstory or history for Regina Malone or Kendrick. They're just there to be
2040800	2046080	manipulated by others. We can see this pattern repeated throughout the book. We get a lengthy
2046080	2050880	story and explanation to create sympathy for Soledad as she descends into terrorism. We see her flee
2050880	2055520	from her ranch, see her friend get hit with a drone strike, and then watch her try to assassinate
2055520	2060160	the president. This is taken from the final page of the book after Soledad has rescued Brett and
2060160	2066080	they're driving towards freedom. Brett looked at her. You're that terrorist. I prefer rancher.
2066080	2071840	The government made me a terrorist. No, said Brett. You make you into a terrorist.
2072880	2079280	You're free to get out at any time. Brett went silent. This part of the book could easily be
2079280	2083600	considered apologetics for a certain type of terrorism and it's all told in a way that we're
2083600	2089440	supposed to feel sympathy or compassion or at least understanding for Soledad and her actions.
2090080	2095360	This book is filled with terrorists but we never get more than the briefest explanations for why
2095360	2099760	they're doing what they do, at least when they're from the Middle East or if they're Muslim.
2100320	2106000	What's telling is who he attempts to give depth, characters whose actions he feels that need to be
2106000	2112080	rationalized as blameless like the cop who shoots an eight-year-old kid or justified like the ranchers
2112080	2117440	who decide to bomb buildings and naturally the lines being drawn are to advance a distinctly
2117440	2124720	right-wing worldview. Ben doesn't seem concerned or interested in the stories of the Black residents
2124720	2130800	of Detroit who aren't scumpags or any terrorists who are swept up under this charismatic leader or
2130800	2136480	even the charismatic leader himself. No, these are cardboard cutouts for the more detailed
2136480	2141680	protagonists to fight against. One of the major players I've only briefly touched on in this book
2141680	2146080	is the media. A quick way of understanding who the novel is trying to portray as sympathetic
2146080	2151360	is seeing what their stance towards the media is. For example, Brett and Ellen show open disdain
2151360	2156640	or disgust for the press at every turn, whereas President Prescott is enthralled by them. And
2156640	2162400	Levon uses the media as a tool for manipulation. In these two cases, the media is portrayed as being
2162400	2167760	powerful enough to lead around the most powerful man in the world but so weak and fragile that it
2167760	2172560	can be easily manipulated by a drug dealer. The media is a corrupting force in these books,
2172560	2178720	although Ben points out a few exceptions like box news or conservative bloggers. The few times we
2178720	2184720	meet reporters or journalists in this book, they're often grimy sneaks like Jack Blatch,
2184720	2189840	who spreads fallacious stories about Brett cheating on Ellen, or they're empty-headed reporters who
2189840	2196320	fawn over Leon, particularly reporters who, the book makes sure we know, are white and female.
2196320	2201920	Just to add a little extra bit of racism to this. The novel is creating this world run by the media
2201920	2207120	and that media has been captured by people with bad intent, typically activists with left-wing
2207120	2212080	politics. Considering this book itself is a piece of media, it's not a huge leap to assume
2212080	2217360	it's playing the same game, acting as a form of propaganda to advance a narrative. Damn the facts
2217360	2222160	and logic it has to trample under its feet. If the left does it, this book seems to argue,
2222160	2227120	shouldn't the right do it as well? Left-wing activists are never portrayed as honest actors
2227120	2232320	in this novel. They are often drug dealers or hustlers seizing power or environmentalists
2232320	2237040	employed by a foreign government. That one random scene in the book's epilogue of the various
2237040	2242480	nations on earth led by China uniting to invade the US isn't as random as it seems. It actually
2242480	2246800	makes perfect sense in the worldview of this book. It's presenting a vision of America that is under
2246800	2252320	siege, seemingly from within, but in truth the danger comes from outside its borders.
2252960	2258720	This is an intensely tribal book, dripping with fear and paranoia. Fear of non-Americans,
2258720	2264320	and often American people of color, as an existential threat to the United States.
2264320	2269600	And those who represent the liberal establishment are enabling these people to destroy America.
2269600	2273840	It's a bit scary to think what sort of mind produces this kind of fiction,
2273840	2278640	a mind so wracked with fear over a world that's out to destroy everything it holds valuable.
2279360	2283120	Going back to some of those quotes plastered on this book, it's even more troubling to see them
2283120	2288880	speaking on how real this book felt. And it must be a feeling because it's literally non-factual,
2288880	2293760	it's completely made up, and it's hilariously inaccurate whenever it discusses geopolitical
2293760	2298720	dynamics in the real world. Aside from the outrageous plot, to identify with the concerns
2298720	2304960	of this book is to identify with fear and paranoia. To assume the world, or more accurately America,
2304960	2310160	is headed towards chaos with one more loan to the Chinese, or every time there's a protest
2310160	2314400	over a black child being murdered. There are a few small moments in this book where I got the
2314400	2319280	impression that it was starting to sound like an honest depiction of the mainstream left in America.
2319280	2325200	I remember one speech by President Prescott that seemed to be a version of something you might have
2325200	2330480	heard former President Obama say, only not as well written. But then the game would be given
2330480	2336160	away completely by diving into Prescott's mind to get some vapid line about how much he loves
2336160	2341280	the cameras, or that he's ogling some blonde in the front row. Ben can't seem to portray left-wing
2341280	2346080	politics as anything more than a farce, as if there's nothing genuinely motivating that side
2346080	2351760	of the political spectrum. At least, not anything more meaningful than vanity. I suspect these are
2351760	2356880	the strawmen Ben wishes he was fighting against, and sometimes thinks he is. By using fiction,
2356880	2361520	he can make them say the things he thinks they secretly believe. Ironically, this book isn't
2361520	2367120	giving us a glimpse into anyone's mind, except for Ben Shapiro's. Books very rarely portray the
2367120	2372640	world in a completely comprehensive and meaningful way. In the hands of truly great writers, they
2372640	2377920	provide us insights into these small fragments that make up the human experience. What shabbier
2377920	2383600	writers reveal is something about themselves and how they see the world. Ben's book doesn't reveal
2383600	2388720	any worthwhile social commentary, rather it lets us look deep into his small paranoid mind and
2388720	2394320	displays the ugly, prejudiced lens through which he sees the world. And Ben wants us to see it that
2394320	2400880	way too. Feel like I gotta repeat, please don't read this book. I got my copy from the library,
2400880	2406000	I did not give Ben Shapiro another sale. Genuinely believe we can learn something using literary
2406000	2409920	analysis regardless of the quality of the book, and I feel like I learned something reading this,
2409920	2415360	and it wasn't a complete loss. I hope maybe you got something out of this video too. All those
2415360	2421040	names you see flashing up on the screen are my delightful, lovely patrons who make videos like
2421040	2425680	this possible. If you would also like to be one of those lovely people, you can head over to my
