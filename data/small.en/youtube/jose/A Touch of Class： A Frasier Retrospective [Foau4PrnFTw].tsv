0	8760	Spin-offs almost never work.
8760	14040	They usually miss the magic of their predecessor, run for half a season, and are quickly forgotten,
14040	16760	resigned to the dustbin of TV history.
16760	21240	Frasier was not just an exception, it was one of those rare sitcoms that went from spin-off
21240	23040	to its own full-fledged hit.
23040	28520	A classic of the 90s, Frasier ran for 11 seasons and was a critical darling, with 37 Emmy wins,
28520	34320	which as of 2022 was the third highest ever for a series and the highest for any sitcom.
34320	37040	Frasier was in some ways an unlikely success story.
37040	42200	As big a hit as Cheers was, being a Cheers spin-off wasn't a surefire recipe for success.
42200	47160	The first spin-off attempt, The Tortelles, lasted a mere 13 episodes before it was cancelled.
47160	51280	When Cheers went off the air, a poll conducted by Pew found that, of all the Cheers characters
51280	56200	who might get a spin-off, only 2% of fans wanted to see one starring Frasier.
56200	60280	Not the best of omens, but Frasier quickly went over any doubters by being a hit from
60280	61880	its very first episode.
61880	65960	Of course, the story behind how that show came to be started before that first title
65960	66960	card.
66960	71160	It's hard to explain Frasier without explaining all of Cheers, and luckily I've already done
71160	72160	that.
72160	74360	If you'd like to hear a detailed breakdown of that show, please check out my video on
74360	75360	Cheers.
75360	77040	For everyone else, here's a quick refresher.
77040	82240	Frasier Crane was introduced in season 3 of the series as a foil in the Sam-Diane will-they-won't-they
82240	83240	relationship.
83240	86840	Although the character was intended to make a quick exit, appearing as a temporary boyfriend
86840	90320	for Diane, Kelsey Grammer made such a strong impression on the show's producers that
90320	92420	they kept him around for the next eight seasons.
92420	96520	In that time, he was left at the altar by Diane, met and married, Lilith Sternan, had
96520	99520	a child named Frederick, revealed that he had been married once before in his younger
99520	103800	days, and eventually divorced Lilith, only to seemingly reconcile in the final season
103800	104800	of the show.
104800	108520	At the end of Cheers, Frasier was set to spend the rest of his days sitting in that bar in
108520	113200	Boston, listening to Cliff tell tall tales, watching Norm drink countless beers, and
113200	117240	inhaling dangerous levels of Sam Malone's many layers of cologne.
117240	120280	But a Frasier spin-off took the character in a new direction.
120280	122400	Let's briefly talk about Wings.
122400	127280	The series was created by David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee, all former writers on
127280	128280	Cheers.
128280	131520	It was through their production company, Grub Street Productions, that they approached Kelsey
131520	133700	Grammer about working on a new series.
133700	136960	They had a good relationship from their time on Cheers together, so much so that Frasier
136960	146480	even made a guest appearance on an episode of Wings.
146480	150160	Originally this new project wasn't going to be a Cheers-related spin-off at all, but
150160	152880	rather an original series starring Kelsey Grammer.
152880	157360	The idea they came up with was that of a wealthy mogul who was in a motorcycle accident and
157360	161400	then confined to his bedroom, running his entire empire from his bed.
161400	166080	The idea was rejected by NBC and Paramount, and it was firmly suggested that the new show
166080	177760	would be about Frasier Crane.
177760	181720	If Frasier was going to return, Kelsey Grammer insisted on the rest of the show being something
181720	185640	entirely new, so the character was packed up, moved to Seattle, and would start a new
185640	188000	life as a radio psychiatrist.
188000	192480	Frasier Crane would be played, of course, by Kelsey Grammer, the erudite, sophisticated
192480	194280	band returning to his hometown.
194280	197920	Although he had known Frasier for nine years on Cheers, in Seattle he would be far more
197920	202560	inclined to let his more cultured side show, with less time spent on bar stools and more
202560	204240	time spent in opera boxes.
204240	207320	He would also spend less time being married and more time trying to figure out how to
207320	222680	be a single man in his forties.
222680	226280	David Hyde Pierce was cast as Niles Crane, Frasier's younger brother.
226280	229720	Although the initial idea for the show never included a brother character, he was added
229720	234200	after assistant casting director Sheila Guthrie pointed out how much Pierce resembled a young
234200	237580	Kelsey Grammer, particularly in his first appearance on Cheers.
237580	241600	After the character was created, the role went directly to Pierce, who created exactly
241600	262000	what you would expect of Frasier's brother, prim, eccentric, and dripping with snobbery.
262000	264040	Martin Crane was played by John Mahoney.
264040	267840	The gruff former cop who finds himself suddenly living with Frasier after he becomes unable
267840	271960	to handle life on his own due to a gunshot wound he received a few years prior.
271960	275680	Martin was inspired by the real-life experience of series co-creator David Lee, who had been
275680	291360	helping take care of his in-form father at the time.
291360	294920	Mahoney was the first choice for the character, and much like Pierce, was offered the role
294920	302600	directly.
302600	306280	Jane Leves played Daphne Moon, Martin's physical therapist and live-in housekeeper
306280	307640	for Frasier and Martin.
307640	311420	Although initially there was some discussion on making her Latina, the producers eventually
311420	315800	made Daphne English, and Jane Leves, like Pierce and Mahoney before her, was pre-approved
315800	316800	for the role.
316800	320680	Daphne provides a quirkier side of Frasier's home life, occasionally dropping in strange
320680	336520	stories from her days back in Manchester, and having the odd psychic vision.
336520	341320	Roz Doyle, played by Perry Gilpin, is the hard-edged foil to the more genteel character
341320	342320	of Frasier.
342320	346840	She brings her frank way of speaking to bear in most scenes at the KACL radio station,
346840	349240	along with a very prolific dating life.
349240	353680	The only character whose actor wasn't pre-approved, at first Lisa Kudrow, was cast to be Roz.
353680	356920	Gilpin was brought in when things didn't work out with her, although Kudrow would find
356920	372600	her own success a year later when she was cast as Phoebe in the show Friends.
372600	376860	The final member of the cast was a lovable Jack Russell Terrier named Moose, who played
376860	378840	the role of Eddie, Martin's pet dog.
378840	382440	Moose played Eddie for the first six seasons, but in later seasons, with Moose getting
382440	399440	older, his son Enzo took up the family business and also played Eddie.
399440	402880	Although the principal cast was relatively small, Frasier made the most of them with
402880	406680	numerous episodes exploring the antics of the Korean men and the women who tolerated
406680	407680	them.
407680	411240	There were current characters who joined them, including Dan Butler as Bob Bulldog
411240	416240	Briscoe, Edward Hibbert as Gil Chesterton, and Tom McGowan as Kenny Daly.
416240	419580	Even though Frasier was a spin-off, there was such a strong desire for it to be its
419580	424420	own show that very few cameos came from Cheers regulars, with one exception, Bebe Neworth,
424420	428160	who would reprise her role as Lilith, in every season of Frasier.
428160	432860	Although the show had no theme song, its ending theme, tossed salad and scrambled eggs, sung
432860	437320	by grammar at his insistence, is one of TV's most memorable closers.
437320	440420	According to the series' composer, Bruce Miller, the lyrics weren't allowed to make
440420	444140	any reference to the subject matter of the show, including its title, and there has been
444140	446720	some speculation as to what the song even means.
446720	450200	Although the lyrics seem nonsensical, they actually do tell a story.
450200	455120	Hey baby, I hear the blues a-callin', tossed salad and scrambled eggs, refers to Frasier's
455120	456920	callers on his radio show.
456920	457920	The next part?
457920	462560	But maybe I seem a bit confused, maybe, but I got you pegged, refers to Frasier struggling
462560	465560	to understand his own life, but still being able to help.
465560	470320	But I don't know what to do with these tossed salad and scrambled eggs, the callin' again,
470320	479560	is a reference to an endless stream of people calling for help.
479560	485900	On September 16th, 1993, Frasier debuted and much of America was watching.
485900	490080	The premiere of Frasier was titled The Good Son, and was written by the show's creators,
490080	494320	David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee, and directed by long-standing Cheers director
494320	495320	James Burroughs.
495440	498840	It very quickly filled in the blanks as to what happened with Frasier following the end
498840	499840	of Cheers.
499840	503000	Six months ago, I was living in Boston.
503000	511640	My wife had left me, which was very painful, then she came back to me, which was excruciating.
511640	514080	Reflecting on this moment, writer David Isaacs said,
514080	515680	That got a big laugh.
515680	516680	Bigger than it should have.
516680	519760	I thought to myself, we're going to be okay.
519760	524280	Part of the premise is given to us right away, with Frasier hosting a radio show in Seattle,
524280	527440	and we are introduced to his brother Niles in a creative way.
527440	531000	Frasier made use of title cards to introduce scenes, so instead of having an awkward bit
531000	535000	of dialogue where the relationship between Frasier and Niles is acknowledged explicitly,
535000	536680	the title card simply reads,
536680	537680	The Brother.
537680	542220	These title cards became an iconic part of the Frasier style, often framing your expectations
542220	546400	for a scene with some important information, or providing a joke to add a bit more levity
546400	547400	into the scene.
547400	551720	In the cafe, Niles helpfully introduces the idea that Martin should move in with Frasier.
551720	554080	All right, I'll make up the spare bedroom.
554080	556080	Oh, you're a good son, Frasier.
556080	559080	Oh god, I am, aren't I?
559080	561080	Two cafe supremos?
561080	562080	Anything to eat?
562080	564680	No, I seem to have lost my appetite.
564680	567200	I'll have a large piece of cheesecake.
567200	569800	Martin is not thrilled with the arrangement.
569800	571120	We all know I am here.
571120	574400	Your old man can't be left alone for ten minutes without falling on his ass and Frasier got
574400	575400	stuck with me.
575400	576400	Isn't that right?
576400	577400	No, no!
577400	578400	No!
578400	579400	No!
580400	581400	I want you here.
581400	583800	They'll give us a chance to get reacquainted.
583800	587800	That implies we were acquainted at one point.
590400	594200	Martin brings one piece of furniture with him to complete Frasier's carefully decorated
594200	596920	apartment, his iconic chair.
596920	601320	After a suggestion from Niles, Frasier decides to hire some help, and we then meet Daphne.
601320	603320	You were a policeman, weren't you?
603320	604960	Yeah, how'd you know?
604960	608960	I must confess, I'm a bit psychic.
610280	614440	Martin instantly wants to hire her, partially, by suspect, to annoy Frasier.
614440	617600	The main conflict of this episode is between Frasier and Martin struggling to find a way
617600	618600	to live together.
618600	622240	Ever since you moved in here, it's been a snide comment about this, or a smart little
622240	623240	put-down about that.
623240	628720	Well, I've done my best to make a home here for you, and once, just once would have killed
628720	630800	you to say thank you!
630800	632880	One lousy thank you!
632880	636200	After the fight, Martin makes a gesture to Frasier the best way he can.
636200	642120	Yeah, I'm worried my son doesn't know that I really appreciate what he's done for me.
642120	643120	Why don't you tell him?
643120	648200	You know how it is with fathers and sons, you have trouble saying that stuff.
648200	655200	Well, if it helps, I suspect your son already knows how you feel.
658200	659200	Is that all?
659200	660200	Yeah, I guess that's it.
660200	662200	Thank you, Dr. Crane.
662200	663200	My pleasure, Martin.
663200	665200	Yeah, what I said, I said thank you!
666200	667200	Yes, I heard.
668200	672200	What makes this a great pilot is that it not only establishes the premise and interests
672200	676200	of the characters, but also sets up one of the primary plotlines for the first few seasons,
676200	680200	Frasier and Martin reconnecting after Frasier had spent 15 years away in Boston.
680200	684200	One thing abundantly clear is that this show will be set in the world of the upper class.
684200	689200	Frasier is obviously well off, and so is Niles, and while Martin and Daphne certainly aren't,
689200	693400	both of them will be living under Frasier's roof, reacting to the context he's created
693400	698600	for them, and Roz, while more akin to Daphne and Martin in class status, typically appears
698600	703480	in scenes at the radio station, the cafe, or Frasier's apartment in a supporting role.
703480	706800	When you look at the class backgrounds of the characters, this split between them matters
706800	709400	far less than the context they find themselves in.
709400	712400	Ultimately, this show is about Frasier's world.
712400	716400	Niles might be the best fit into it, but to an extent, all the other characters are trying
716400	718240	to fit into Frasier's world as well.
718240	721960	And this is all very ironic considering this whole episode is about Frasier fighting himself
721960	723160	in a new context.
723160	727240	It speaks to the power of perspective and how when a show focuses on one character,
727240	731160	it can very easily shape the world around them, and how they define this space.
737160	741720	Living in an apartment that is almost timelessly classic in its design, working the cushy job
741720	746480	of radio psychiatrists and going to chic restaurants and art events, Frasier Crane is a man of
746480	748040	means and class.
748040	752440	He's also incredibly vain, arrogant, and sometimes a complete goof.
752440	755600	But none of these qualities make him particularly likeable.
755600	758960	The key to Frasier's appeal is that he very deeply cares about people.
758960	763800	Frasier's job as a radiotherapist makes him something of a local celebrity in Seattle,
763800	766240	more so than you'd expect from someone on the radio.
766240	769400	And Frasier is more than happy to revel in that fame and fortune.
769400	775120	Then I will just tell them that they can take their five-figure deal and find someone else.
775120	776120	Five figures.
776120	777680	Didn't I mention pressures?
777680	780280	This is for television, the big kahuna.
780280	781280	Television.
781280	785760	The research has shown that a single television commercial can turn an obscure radio personality
785760	788600	into a national celebrity.
788600	793800	A year from now, someone like you could be broadcasting your message of hope and healing
793800	801840	not just to the Pacific Northwest, but to the entire nation.
801840	806560	That celebrity affords Frasier access to Seattle's more elite circles, often hobbing with the
806560	808360	most impressive of knobs.
808440	812720	What makes Frasier fun to watch is when that class status makes him the subject of mockery.
812720	816120	For example, when Bulldog tricks them into singing some Gilbert and Sullivan.
816120	820120	I don't suppose you happen to remember the words to Three Little Maids?
820120	822120	Well, let me see.
822120	826120	Three little maids from school are we?
826120	829120	Where does the school go where they may be?
829120	832120	Filled with the brim with girlish glee.
832120	835120	And the maids from school.
835280	839360	It's the classic comedy trope of laughing at someone in a higher class be humiliated.
839360	842960	And while it's easy to laugh at Frasier's class making him look silly, it does make
842960	847080	it tougher to empathize with him when it also isolates him from suffering.
847080	850880	In The Crucible, Frasier is the victim of fraud when a painting he's purchased is
850880	851880	revealed to be a forgery.
851880	852880	I didn't paint it.
852880	860880	Of course you didn't, you created it, you gave birth to it.
860880	864880	I didn't do anything to it.
865120	869120	I never saw this painting before in my whole life.
869120	873840	And you thought I was going to embarrass you?
873840	877760	The cops are unable to help Frasier, and a legal proceeding against the gallery he bought
877760	881080	the painting from would cost more than the painting is worth, leaving him with nothing
881080	883720	to do but hurl a brick through the gallery's window.
883720	886720	If you act like a barbarian, you will become a barbarian.
886720	889720	Give him the brick, Frasier.
889720	890720	And let him get away with this!
890720	891720	I know, I know.
891720	893720	What the gallery owner did to you was wrong.
894160	896160	It was humiliating.
896160	899360	But if you throw that brick through that window, you will have lost something more valuable
899360	900360	than your money.
900360	904360	You will have lost your mind.
904360	907080	Frasier, you can't do this!
907080	911720	Injustice for Frasier is a blow to his ego, but not the material conditions of his life.
911720	917360	Niles' advice is good only insofar that Frasier can afford to take a little humiliation.
917360	920280	What if this was someone who has swindled out of their savings, or even their weekly
920280	921280	paycheck?
921280	924720	The reason here is that the privileged can afford for the system to fail them.
924720	929100	At the end of the show's fifth season, Frasier's stand against KACL's station manager gets
929100	931360	him and all of his colleagues fired.
931360	934840	And we see Frasier in Season 6 out of work for the first nine episodes.
934840	935840	Frasier?
935840	941840	You're not famous anymore.
941840	944960	Kelsey Grammer spoke about these episodes with Frasier being out of work.
944960	946400	We thought it was a good storyline.
946400	947820	We got nine stories out of it.
947820	950200	We thought it was an interesting journey for him to take.
950200	953920	We always knew he was going to go back to the station, but I think it might have made
953920	957640	the audience uncomfortable because Frasier wasn't as attractive.
957640	959800	There was something more sad about him.
959800	963460	Frasier's suffering is a huge part of what makes the show work, but that's often seen
963460	968040	through his many failures in dating or struggling to hold a dinner party, being out of work
968040	969040	hit differently.
969040	972800	It's easy enough to empathize with a Frasier struggling to find someone.
972800	974000	Dating is universal.
974000	977760	And when his fancy dinner parties go awry, it's usually just his own vanity biting him
977760	978760	in the butt.
978760	981000	This pain wasn't as easy to laugh at.
981000	985880	It was understandable without being relatable, because even out of work, Frasier wasn't hurting
985880	986880	for money.
986880	989040	He was upset that he wasn't famous anymore.
989040	992960	It's possible to pity Frasier, but it's a lot harder to empathize.
992960	996480	And empathy is at the heart of what makes Frasier a great character.
996480	1000200	We can see Frasier's personal empathy in his chosen profession as a psychiatrist.
1000200	1004100	Frasier's background in psychiatry means he's a medical doctor who has chosen to specialize
1004100	1005260	in mental health.
1005260	1009540	Although being a character created in 1984, he represents a very old-fashioned depiction
1009540	1013940	of a psychiatrist, one who fits the classic mold of having a patient sit on a couch while
1013940	1017700	they talk through their problems, as their psychiatrist takes notes and offers a few
1017700	1018700	insights.
1018700	1022620	Something you're more likely to see a psychologist do today rather than a psychiatrist.
1022620	1025140	Frasier practices his psychiatry through his radio show.
1025140	1026140	Hello, Mark.
1026140	1027140	I'm listening.
1027140	1028140	Okay.
1028140	1033700	Uh, well, I work at this all-night mini-mart, and, um, I've been watching myself on the
1033700	1039500	video camera, and the camera me is doing things I don't approve of.
1039500	1042940	These calls are often voiced by some pretty popular actors, including Mel Brooks, Ben
1042940	1046980	Steller, Elijah Wood, Mary Tyler Moore, and Kevin Bacon.
1046980	1051100	Frasier is a Freudian, which dates them even further back to the practice of psychoanalysis.
1051100	1055700	And psychoanalysis, as is sometimes mentioned on the show, doesn't have the best track
1055700	1056700	record.
1056700	1060780	In the episode, Chess Pains, after losing several games of chess against his father,
1060780	1062260	Frasier is obsessed with winning.
1062260	1067020	I am analyzing my options, unlike your winged abroach, I like to plan a strategy, like a
1067020	1074260	general leading his troops into battle.
1074260	1076420	Jack made Schwarzkopf.
1076420	1082260	Frasier, who fancies himself an intellectual force, can accept that his less-educated father,
1082260	1085020	who had never played chess before, is better than him.
1085020	1087820	So Frasier and Niles analyze why this is happening.
1087820	1090860	Sooner or later, the son eclipses the father, it's the natural order.
1090860	1094580	Yet, it's frequently a stumbling block, because the son's competitive stirrings
1094580	1097580	are accompanied by tremendous feelings of guilt.
1097580	1098580	I see.
1098580	1101460	Yes, it's the classic edible conflict.
1101460	1102460	My God.
1102460	1105740	And it seems so obvious now, I've been letting him win.
1105740	1108700	Later, Martin cuts the heart of what's really happening.
1108700	1110180	This isn't about losing, is it?
1110180	1112460	This is about losing to me.
1112460	1114460	That's what's driving you nuts.
1114460	1115660	How could I lose to the old man?
1115660	1117020	I'm much smarter than he is.
1117020	1118020	I never said that.
1118020	1119500	No, you didn't have to say you've thought it all your life.
1119500	1120500	No, I haven't.
1120500	1122500	No, you're insulting my intelligence again.
1122500	1124420	The answer is painfully obvious.
1124420	1126660	Martin is just better at chess than Frasier.
1126660	1131220	In fact, there's an episode of Cheers where Frasier loses a game of chess to the slow-witted
1131220	1134980	Woody, raising serious questions about Frasier's chess skills.
1134980	1138260	Rather than accept that, maybe he needs to improve his chess game, Frasier and Niles
1138260	1141460	concoct this Freudian explanation as to why Frasier keeps losing.
1141460	1144980	It isn't a genuine attempt to understand the situation, but rather to protect Frasier's
1144980	1149940	ego on the presumption that an educated man like him must be better at chess than Martin.
1149940	1153380	Even when Frasier finally wins, he has to make a subtle nod to his little pet theory
1153380	1155940	about this being some kind of Oedipal struggle.
1155940	1159940	I'm sorry I beat your dad.
1159940	1163820	This once again highlights how Frasier is at its funniest when it's highlighting the
1163820	1165940	excesses of the character.
1165940	1170740	The series often includes skepticism towards psychiatry and psychology more broadly, or
1170740	1172980	at least the type practiced by Frasier and Niles.
1172980	1178180	I'm not like a psychiatrist who works with someone for years and years and it doesn't
1178180	1182580	matter if they ever get better.
1182580	1184300	A bust of Freud.
1184300	1187500	Oh, well, that's really quite thoughtful of you.
1187500	1196340	I figured you'd appreciate the irony, since he's been proven wrong about practically everything.
1196340	1200060	I like to think that Freud's theories will stand the test of time.
1200060	1201060	Really?
1201060	1203060	Have you read either of his books?
1203060	1204820	Oh, what a relief.
1204820	1206540	I've been wringing my hands over nothing.
1206540	1207540	I mean, it's okay.
1207540	1212180	All I want to do is have sex with my dead mother.
1212180	1215540	That last clip is Frasier sighing in relief because he's figured out the meaning of
1215540	1219260	a particularly difficult dream he's been having where he finds himself in bed with
1219260	1221540	his colleague, Gil.
1221540	1226260	Well, look who's up.
1226260	1231020	Although dreams being secret desires people have isn't backed by much scientific evidence,
1231020	1235180	if you're someone who buys into dream analysis, the obvious reading here is that Frasier is
1235180	1244900	secretly gay, an interpretation he resists.
1244900	1248740	So he and Niles dive deep into their knowledge of dream analysis to pull together all sorts
1248740	1253340	of conclusions that will, supposedly, resolve the tension in Frasier's mind, letting him
1253340	1262020	avoid these dreams.
1262020	1265120	Once again, this analysis is very forced.
1265120	1268760	The tools of Freudian psychoanalysis are less a tool for greater understanding and
1268760	1271280	used instead to reassure Frasier's ego.
1271280	1275540	In the decades since his ideas were introduced, much of the work of Sigmund Freud has largely
1275540	1276540	been supplanted.
1276540	1280020	The best explanation I've heard as to why he should still be taught in an academic setting
1280020	1284760	is that his insights were incredibly important, even though his conclusions were ridiculous.
1284760	1288880	For example, his insight that human development is a product of not nature or nurture, but
1288880	1292580	rather nature interacting with nurture, was groundbreaking.
1292580	1296860	But his conclusion, that development was the guiding of sexual desire through distinct
1296860	1302300	stages from infancy to adolescence, leading to some kind of oral fixation, is completely
1302300	1304340	without empirical support.
1304340	1308100	While it might seem like I'm being a bit unfair to an older show, none of what I'm
1308100	1309860	saying is particularly new.
1309860	1312980	Freud's theories have been criticized for decades, and much of this was known in the
1312980	1313980	90s.
1313980	1318540	Frasier represents the classic idea of a psychiatrist in the world of pop culture, not reality.
1318540	1322160	The type of psychoanalysis done by Frasier is sometimes not much better than what Daphne
1322160	1338000	can figure out on her own.
1338000	1341520	By the end of this episode, Frasier realizes he's feeling frustrated at work because
1341520	1345440	he finds a lack of challenge in the colors he's getting, and according to him and Niles,
1345440	1347080	that should resolve the dream.
1347080	1349000	Except the episode ends like this.
1349000	1372520	And just to be clear, I'm not saying therapy is a bad thing.
1372520	1376680	In fact, working with a psychiatrist or psychologist can be incredibly helpful in improving one's
1376680	1377680	mental health.
1377680	1381960	What I am saying is that Frasier and Niles often let their biases impact their psychiatry,
1381960	1385800	particularly when they try to understand themselves, and that some of the theories and ideas that
1385800	1389120	they use are very out of date, even for the 90s.
1389120	1392480	There is another problem with the type of psychiatry practiced by Frasier and Niles
1392480	1393480	too.
1393480	1395320	Generally speaking, it is very expensive.
1395320	1398800	While Frasier doesn't charge his colors anything, his background and expertise come
1398800	1401800	from a field of medicine that is very lucrative.
1401800	1405520	Psychoanalytic therapy can involve multiple sessions a week, sometimes lasting for years,
1405520	1409440	and at a cost of one to two hundred dollars a session in today's money, this type of therapy
1409440	1411320	can be very costly.
1411320	1414820	Another way in which this series demonstrates the barriers class places between acts of
1414820	1416160	compassion.
1416160	1419200	Although Frasier has chosen a field that puts his help out of the reach of all but the most
1419200	1423600	privileged, one overarching aspect of his character, and one that makes him particularly likable,
1423600	1425820	is that he genuinely wants to help other people.
1425820	1429040	This can be seen in him choosing to host a show where people can call in with their problems
1429040	1431900	for free, as limited to help as that may be.
1431900	1436100	One specific example of Frasier's compassion overcoming his vanity is in the episode Death
1436100	1437100	Becomes Him.
1437100	1441420	When Martin's physician suddenly passes away, a man who was similar in physique, behavior
1441420	1453020	and temperament to Frasier, it leads him to question his own mortality.
1453020	1456540	Frasier becomes obsessed, planning his own funeral and trying to find a way in which
1456540	1458340	this doctor neglected his health.
1458340	1460660	He even crashes the man's shiva to learn more about him.
1460660	1481860	He only steps out of his vanity when the opportunity to help someone arises.
1481860	1485740	Frasier's insight comes from his own experiences, and he uses these moments of compassion for
1485740	1488340	others as opportunities to grow himself.
1488340	1493420	Which isn't the safest way to practice psychiatry, but on a more human, emotional level, it offers
1493420	1495780	the chance for two people to help one another.
1495780	1499780	In the episode Dark Victory, a disastrous birthday party for Martin leaves everyone
1499780	1511660	bickering.
1511660	1514900	With a blackout keeping them all indoors, Frasier makes the rounds with everyone in
1514900	1539140	his little extended family offer an advice to calm their various tensions.
1539140	1542180	It just makes me feel like I'm not very ambitious.
1542180	1546220	I mean, I could be working in a hospital or a clinic.
1546220	1550380	Of course you could, Daphne, but maybe that's not what's important to you right now.
1550380	1552340	I think you'd like being part of a family.
1552340	1558780	If you can't walk around Paris, you could sit at a nice cafe and let Paris walk past
1558780	1559780	you.
1559780	1563940	Maybe buy a glass of wine for a beautiful mademoiselle.
1563940	1566020	Get yourself a nice bottle of imported beer.
1566020	1568380	I only like Valentines.
1568380	1570900	In Paris, Valentines is imported beer.
1570900	1576740	Could it be that you're really upset just because you couldn't help that woman?
1576740	1578580	You know I really hate that.
1578580	1582540	When you take a simple criticism and you turn it back on me, well, I think I'm right.
1582540	1585180	Well, of course you're right while you think I hate it.
1585180	1588540	And at the end of it all, Frasier is left emotionally spent.
1588540	1594860	I tend to each one of you, and you all feel better, and the minute you get a whiff of mesquite
1594860	1602380	coming from down below, you are out the door, without so much as a thank you.
1602380	1608860	Well, thank you for the invitation, but I am frankly fed up with people and their problems.
1608860	1610300	The doctor is out.
1610300	1611300	Oh, great.
1611300	1612300	You didn't feel that way.
1612300	1613300	I am.
1613300	1614300	Okay, apologies, except-
1614300	1615300	Oh, great.
1615300	1617300	You'll come.
1617300	1620940	Frasier is a helper, from the colors on his show to his own family, and more than that,
1620940	1623620	he's willing to sacrifice his own downtime to help others.
1623620	1627780	Albeit while venting his frustrations at the situation, which is totally fair when
1627780	1631100	you consider his job is to help people, and having to do the same for the people in his
1631100	1633760	personal life might feel incredibly taxing.
1633760	1636340	But that gets to the heart of why he's a likable character.
1636340	1638660	He's willing to put others before himself.
1638660	1642460	One particularly clever part of this episode is that it takes place during a blackout,
1642460	1646500	which makes the fancy trappings around them disappear, leaving the characters with only
1646500	1648300	the props of their own baggage.
1648300	1652020	With all that gone, Frasier can navigate through the void, using only his compassion to connect
1652020	1653300	with his loved ones.
1653300	1654740	And it works very well.
1654740	1658100	Problems are solved, rifts are mended, and everyone is brought a few steps closer to
1658100	1659100	each other.
1659100	1663660	In the episode, The Thousandth Show, Seattle hosts a Frasier Crane Day episode, speaking
1663660	1665340	directly to Frasier's vanity.
1665340	1674260	For your sake and the stations to submit to a small, tasteful, low-key public rally.
1674260	1677860	A series of mishaps keep Frasier from the rally, and he's left to dwell on his own
1677860	1678860	sense of self.
1678860	1682140	I wanted my day.
1682140	1688300	I wanted hoopla and fuss, practically playing the whole thing myself.
1688300	1692900	When Frasier eventually gets to the rally via a limo ride, or rather, almost there,
1692900	1696140	he postpones attending because he's met someone who needs help.
1696140	1705340	Don't worry about me, I've got plenty of time, tell me more about your kids, alright?
1705340	1709100	I'm John, by the way, I'm Frasier.
1709100	1712900	The crumpled sign reflects how hollow the fame and fortune are compared to the act of
1712900	1713900	compassion.
1713900	1717380	Much like the blackout hiding Frasier's wealth, this obscuring of Frasier's fame
1717380	1721220	reveal that the true value of his character comes from how he helps people.
1721220	1725620	Frasier's wealth and radio show, fueled by his occasionally dubious psychiatry, create
1725620	1728540	a distance between him and the people he wants to help.
1728540	1732900	In the episode, Frasier's Edge, this becomes particularly evident.
1732900	1736340	After being told he'll be winning a Lifetime Achievement Award, Frasier has a crisis of
1736340	1753460	confidence and goes to see his old mentor, Dr. William Tewksbury, played by René Obejongwa.
1753460	1757860	Dr. Tewksbury reveals to Frasier that he has a tendency to keep people at a distance.
1757860	1758860	How's your practice?
1758860	1762340	I don't have a practice, I have a radio show.
1762340	1763580	Distance?
1763580	1764580	Any children?
1764580	1767780	Yes, I have a wonderful son with whom I'm very close.
1767780	1768780	You live with him?
1768780	1770900	He lives in Boston.
1770900	1772900	Distance?
1772900	1773900	With your wife?
1773900	1774900	My ex-wife.
1774900	1775900	Yes, I know.
1775900	1776900	Distance.
1776900	1777900	Wasn't she a psychiatrist?
1777900	1778900	Yes, she was.
1778900	1779900	She happened to be a damn good one, too.
1779900	1784020	Well, that's a handy choice for someone who'd rather share ideas than emotions.
1784020	1787660	Have you ever met Lilith?
1787660	1789060	No.
1789860	1795420	Well, she happens to be a very warm and loving woman.
1795420	1799220	Although psychoanalysis isn't always the best tool for providing therapy to someone,
1799220	1803020	it does make for a handy way of dissecting art, particularly art that holds it in high
1803020	1804020	regard.
1804020	1807780	This episode demonstrates the distance Frasier has created in his life, but it goes beyond
1807780	1810900	the personal relationships and professional choices he's made.
1810900	1813220	It goes deep into who he is as a character.
1813220	1816720	He lives in a social class that creates distance from the rest of the world.
1816720	1820040	He works in a profession only available to those with the means to pay for it.
1820040	1823400	And when he takes a step towards bringing his expertise to the people, it's done in
1823400	1826520	a way that keeps those people at a distance as well.
1826520	1831200	And somehow through all those distances, manages to make real connections and give people genuine
1831200	1832200	comfort.
1832200	1836560	Class, through the mediums of wealth and exclusive medical treatment, reveals itself to be a
1836560	1839360	barrier to expressions of human compassion.
1839360	1843800	Frasier is a likeable character, not because he uses his status to help others, but because
1843800	1845680	he can help others in spite of it.
1846720	1856200	Frasier simply wouldn't exist without Cheers, so it made perfect sense for some of those
1856200	1859680	old friends from Cheers to stop by for a few cameos throughout the years.
1859680	1863760	Frasier had been moved to Seattle, in part, to signify that this new show would be a departure
1863760	1867320	from Cheers, and the first season of Frasier deliberately avoided bringing back any other
1867320	1868640	Cheers alumni.
1868640	1871720	The one exception, naturally, was his ex-wife Lilith.
1871720	1875440	And the episode featuring her return, titled The Show Where Lilith Comes Back, was the
1875440	1883040	second most watched episode of Frasier ever.
1883040	1901400	Luckily for us, Frasier and Lilith still have that wonderful chemistry.
1901400	1905360	Lilith would make guest appearances in each of the show's 11 seasons, including a particularly
1905360	1915880	memorable episode where she hooks up with Niles.
1915880	1920680	Frasier's son Frederick, first played by Luke Tarsetano and then Trevor Einhorn, also
1920680	1946760	made several appearances, memorably offering some competition to Niles.
1946760	1949920	By the end of the series, we see how Frasier and Lilith have grown to have a meaningful
1949920	1960200	friendship together, and Frasier, in spite of Frederick entering his goth phase in the
1960200	1986920	final season, still manages to have a connection with his son.
1986920	1990200	Frasier, in spite of the challenges of living on the other side of the country, manages
1990200	1993440	to hold onto the things that matter most to him from his time in Boston.
1993440	1995480	It's a charmingly uplifting message.
1995480	1999400	Of course, there were some other connections from Boston who also had cameos.
1999400	2003600	In the season two episode, The Show Where Sam Shows Up, Sam Malone, naturally played
2003600	2006520	by Ted Denson, makes a surprise appearance in Seattle.
2006520	2010200	This episode also provides some interesting bits of trivia, such as highlighting how much
2010200	2027880	David Hyde Pierce looked like a young Kelsey Grammer when he first appeared on Cheers.
2027880	2056320	We also get some plot holes addressed, such as the truth behind Frasier's father.
2056320	2065320	In the episode, The Show Where Diane Comes Back, we get a cameo from Shelly Long, reprising
2065320	2067820	her role as Diane, Frasier's horror fiancé.
2067820	2072160	There was a very brief Diane cameo in season two, but it was this season three episode
2072160	2076520	that really brought her back for a proper Cheers reunion, complete with a stage production.
2076520	2100760	The episode offers Frasier the chance to get some real closure with Diane after over
2100760	2120080	a decade of bitterness.
2120080	2124440	In season six, Woody Harrelson once again took up the role of Woody Boyd in an episode
2124440	2128280	you'll be shocked to learn was called The Show Where Woody Shows Up.
2128280	2132280	This episode really seemed to tie a bow on the idea that Frasier was no longer a spin-off
2132280	2134440	and had cemented its own identity.
2158280	2179360	The last of the Cheers reunions is also the
2179360	2182420	only one with an original name, Cheerful Goodbyes.
2182420	2186480	This brought back Cliff Clavin, played by John Ratzenberger, Norm Peterson, played by
2186480	2191600	George Wendt, and Carla Maria, Victoria Angelina, Teresa Apollonia, Lu Ponce, Tartale Lebec,
2191600	2193000	played by Rhea Perlman.
2193000	2197240	Of the Cheers reunions, this one is the most extensive and feels the least natural.
2197240	2200800	Even though it takes place in Boston, there's no sign of the original Cheers bar.
2200800	2203860	It also doesn't quite feel the same without Sam, Woody, or Rebecca.
2203860	2207760	The interactions between the two casts are interesting, but are mostly a novelty.
2207760	2211760	The presence of a guy who looks suspiciously like Cheers director James Burroughs, who
2211760	2216240	also directed 32 episodes of Frasier, along with cameos from a number of Cheers regulars,
2216240	2220480	makes the whole episode feel like a messy celebration of the series that birthed Frasier.
2220480	2224120	It might have made for a good Cheers reunion, but it being an average episode of Frasier
2224120	2227840	speaks even further to how far apart these two shows have grown.
2227840	2231240	The only principal cast member from Cheers still alive to not appear on Frasier at all
2231240	2232240	was Christy Alley.
2232240	2236360	It's been reported that the reason why was because Alley, a practicing Scientologist,
2236360	2238680	didn't approve of a show about psychiatry.
2238680	2242240	When asked in an interview about why Alley hadn't appeared on the show, co-creator
2242240	2243240	David Lee said,
2243240	2250560	I don't recall asking.
2250560	2254000	The original premise for Frasier was the building of a relationship between Frasier and his
2254000	2263280	father Martin.
2263280	2266480	Many of the early episodes of the series include moments where Frasier and Martin make an effort
2266480	2276320	to connect, and it's a bit of a struggle for them.
2276320	2298800	Martin is the voice of reason when it comes to making things work.
2298800	2303520	Importantly, Martin's not just being roped into a pet project of Frasier's to mend their
2303520	2305640	relationship, he wants to reconnect as well.
2305640	2309420	And rather than through Frasier's exercises, growing closer comes about just by them being
2309420	2313120	together more often, creating new opportunities to learn about one another.
2313120	2317200	It seems like a tall order, with Martin being so unlike his sons, but Kelsey Grammer summed
2317200	2319200	up the dynamic nicely, saying,
2319200	2322440	People always ask how Frasier and Niles came from a father like Martin.
2322440	2325160	Martin's in public service, into knowing what's right and wrong.
2325160	2326640	That's exactly what his sons were.
2326640	2331280	On the simplest level, he was a good man, and their hope was to become the same thing.
2331280	2335420	One sweet example is in the episode, Martin Does It His Way, where the Crane men bond while
2335420	2339320	trying to piece together a song Martin had written decades previously he was hoping to
2339320	2352220	send to Frank Sinatra.
2352220	2355660	While many of the bonding moments were like this, the series also didn't shy away from
2355660	2357180	other types of bonding.
2357180	2361140	In Beloved Infidel, a secret is revealed about Martin and an old family friend.
2361140	2384260	But eventually, Frasier finds out the truth.
2384260	2402900	And the two have something to connect over.
2432900	2450700	The idea of bonding over trauma is a good one,
2450700	2454580	and the family connection makes it even stronger, helping forge this connection Martin and Frasier
2454580	2455580	were hoping for.
2455580	2460140	And by the fourth season, we started to see this father-son relationship take real shape.
2460140	2464820	In Our Father Whose Art Ain't Heaven, Frasier refuses a gift from Martin, and we see what
2464820	2489420	that gesture meant to the guy.
2489420	2507740	And Frasier wasn't the only son connecting to Martin.
2507740	2510940	Even the small gestures reveal how the two of them have grown closer together.
2510940	2536620	This all raises some interesting questions about the show, if, by the halfway point,
2536620	2541140	the main premise of a father and son reconnecting had already reached its conclusion.
2541140	2542700	What's to be done with Martin?
2542700	2545940	To understand Martin, though, it's important to take a step back and understand who his
2545940	2549540	character is aside from his relationship with Frasier.
2549540	2552420	Martin is often positioned on the show as the average guy.
2552420	2555620	The working class everyman most of the audience can relate to.
2555620	2559580	Except, Martin isn't really the average blue-collar worker he's presented as.
2559580	2560860	He's a former cop.
2560860	2563500	And that has an impact on how he sees the world.
2563500	2575500	Here's a brief example of his politics.
2575500	2579500	When Frasier is dealing with a con man in the episode, Fool Me Once, Shame On You, Fool
2579500	2588020	Me Twice, Martin makes his feelings about people in general clear.
2588020	2591900	Although we only get vague references to Martin's life before he became a cop, his time working
2591900	2595460	for the force has certainly cemented the idea that people are generally bad and need
2595460	2598300	the firm hand of the police to keep them in check.
2598300	2601580	Throughout the series, Martin is softened quite a bit, becoming more well-versed in
2601580	2604860	the finer things in life thanks to his time with Frasier, and becoming a kinder, gentler
2604860	2608820	person as a result of having a stronger home life in connection with his sons.
2608820	2612020	But his attitudes towards people more broadly doesn't change too much.
2612020	2615740	He can't share Frasier's optimism that people are generally good, and when he's given the
2615740	2620060	opportunity to offer some forgiveness of his own, he can't bring himself to do it.
2620060	2623940	In the season 8 episode, A Day in May, Martin attends the parole hearing of the guy who
2623940	2624940	shot him.
2624940	2628820	Even after speaking with the man's mother, Martin can't bring himself to make a statement
2628820	2641980	in favor of his release.
2641980	2645540	Martin doesn't have to forgive the guy who shot him, but his rigidness here represents
2645540	2649700	a side of him that he carries throughout the series, this skepticism towards the idea that
2649700	2653220	people can change for the better, which is ironic considering in his own change throughout
2653220	2657300	the series, such as finally mustering the courage to tell his sons that he loves them.
2657300	2685500	Martin's struggle to connect with his sons
2685500	2689140	and his cynicism towards society present a man who is trapped in certain confining
2689140	2690980	elements of masculinity.
2690980	2694900	We see Martin get angry when Eddie is playing with a doll, or his deep discomfort when Frasier
2694900	2697780	wants to talk about his concerns that he may be gay.
2697780	2701180	Martin has a very fixed idea of what it means to be a man in the world, and it's what makes
2701180	2702180	him miserable.
2702180	2706020	It may also be part of the reason he chose to become a police officer, a job that reflects
2706020	2709100	masculinity that drenched him in cynicism.
2709100	2712900	Martin is both a victim and a critique of the times he lived in, and sometimes the show
2712900	2714940	goes out of its way to present that to us.
2714940	2736900	Here's Martin opining on women getting pregnant out of wedlock.
2736900	2741220	In later seasons of the series, Martin began something close to a redemption arc.
2741220	2745700	In The Return of Martin Crane, we see Martin leave his early retirement, rejoining the working
2745700	2747500	world as a security guard.
2747500	2751100	Although not exactly quite the high-stakes job of his younger days, it does let him reclaim
2751100	2753580	part of his life by feeling like he's part of society.
2753580	2757220	It's not as though he's in dire need of assistance, with him being quite happy living
2757220	2760940	with Frasier, but Martin needs something to feel like he isn't just slipping into the
2760940	2763220	back pocket of someone else's life.
2763220	2775860	Unadorably, part of Martin reasserting himself often involves treating his sons like kids.
2775860	2779020	This happened throughout the series and was one of the few ways Martin would assert control
2779020	2780020	over his life.
2780020	2782700	Martin's dating life was a subject throughout the series.
2782700	2786140	While he had had some success with women, it wasn't until the show's final season
2786140	2790260	that he met Ronnie Lawrence, played by Wendy Mallick, a former babysitter of Frasier and
2790260	2791260	Niles.
2791260	2804740	It's a bit strange, considering the dynamic they used to have, though it has been over
2804740	2808940	thirty years since Ronnie was a teenage babysitter working for the Cranes.
2808940	2828940	Even so, Martin still feels a bit insecure.
2828940	2832060	Martin eventually tells Ronnie how strongly he feels about her, and the two grow closer
2832060	2833700	throughout the final season.
2833700	2837260	At the beginning of the series, Martin is a crotchety old man with a funny dog who lives
2837260	2840980	alone, with no real connections aside from his old buddies on the police force.
2840980	2845180	By the end, he's reconnected with his sons, found new family in Daphne and Roz, managed
2845180	2848900	to find his first lasting relationship since his wife passed away, a new purpose with a
2848900	2851500	new job, and he still has that funny dog.
2851500	2854540	Martin wasn't quite the everyman because it's difficult to believe that the average
2854540	2859180	man lives a life quite as tragic as his had been in that first episode, and one drenched
2859180	2862260	in so much cynicism and bitterness towards the world at large.
2862260	2866900	But by making him the everyman and highlighting his journey, it reveals that life can still
2866900	2870700	change, even in old age, in some of the most dire of circumstances, that you can discover
2870700	2873020	a new reason to wake up every morning.
2873020	2876500	Martin still carries the baggage of a cynical cop who's been shaped into someone suspicious
2876500	2880060	of the world around him, but by learning to find the good in his life, from family and
2880060	2883780	new friends, he's at least found some kind of happiness.
2883780	2886180	Frasier writer Joe Keenan explains this saying,
2886180	2888740	Martin could have stepped out of an Arthur Miller play.
2888740	2892700	The guy's lost everything he's loved, his wife, job, independence.
2892700	2896660	He has nothing left but his dog, chair, and two sons he feels look down on him.
2896660	2900220	Keenan warm-up to them gave the show its sweetest, most hopeful long-term arc.
2900220	2904940	In the episode Freudian Sleep, the cast of the show, Minus Ross, have a series of bizarre
2904940	2907420	nightmares while staying at a house in the mountains.
2907420	2923260	When we peer into Martin's dreams, though, they take a different tone.
2923260	2927020	Of all the sections, this one was a bit of a struggle, as Eddie is the character steeped
2927020	2929260	in the most scandalous of controversies.
2929260	2933380	I should acknowledge first one of the big ones that he has had a long-standing feud
2933380	2952740	with a certain type of bird.
2952740	2956420	I'd like to remind my audience that we aren't hearing the bird side of the story for this
2956420	2959780	incident, so please don't rush to judgment of this particular Blue Jay.
2959780	2963500	Behind the scenes, there was also ongoing drama between the dogs who played Eddie, Moose
2963500	2964780	and his son Enzo.
2964780	2966500	Co-creator Peter Casey explains,
2966500	2968620	Moose and Enzo hated each other.
2968620	2969980	They couldn't be on the set together.
2969980	2974140	Apparently it was one of those classic parent-child Hollywood rivalries.
2974140	2978100	Even with all this controversy swirling about, there were a number of wonderful Eddie moments.
2978100	2981140	Much of this should be credited to his trainer, Matilda Cagney.
2981140	2988380	She even got a nod in one of the episodes.
2988380	2992620	It's difficult to analyze the majesty and depth of the Eddie character, so I won't
2992620	2997700	go into too much more detail aside from the fact that throughout the series he was, unquestionably
2997700	3000700	and unwaveringly, a very good boy.
3000700	3005980	There were also the revelations in his groundbreaking biography, the details of which can be safely
3005980	3007740	passed over in this video.
3007740	3016660	You can see this book out of your careers to learn more about this pup.
3016660	3020220	One of the signature styles of Frasier was its use of farce.
3020220	3024740	These comedies of errors revolved around a misunderstanding or misunderstandings spiraling
3024740	3025740	out of control.
3025740	3029740	An early example is the episode The Matchmaker, where Frasier's new boss thinks he's gay.
3029740	3049580	Another would be the innkeepers, where Frasier and Niles open a restaurant together.
3049580	3073900	Or the much beloved Ham Radio, where Frasier stages a radio play.
3073900	3078020	But the most fondly remembered of these episodes, so much so that it's the favorite of many
3078020	3081100	fans, is the ski lodge.
3081100	3084980	After Roz wins a free trip to a ski lodge, Frasier convinces to sell it to him.
3084980	3089380	So he takes Niles, Martin, Daphne, and Daphne's friend Annie, played by Cynthia LaMontagne,
3089380	3094340	to enjoy a ski trip, complete with ski instructor Guy, played by James Patrick Stewart.
3094340	3098940	This episode featured an elaborate ski lodge set, one of only two that was so big it was
3098940	3101780	built in front of the main set of Frasier's apartment.
3101780	3105760	The basic idea of this episode is that everyone, aside from Martin, is attracted to another
3105760	3110360	person in that ski lodge, only no one seems to know who is into who.
3110360	3114720	Frasier is into Annie, Annie is into Niles, Niles is, of course, into Daphne, Daphne
3114720	3117800	is into Guy, and Guy is into Niles.
3117800	3120520	Some misunderstandings lead to a few memorable moments.
3147800	3162680	It's all absurdly convoluted, yet somehow still manages to work.
3162680	3166160	The writer for the episode, David Lee, explains why this episode worked so well.
3166160	3169120	The motivations always have to be absolutely real.
3169120	3170680	It helps if they come from the heart.
3170680	3174520	They can also come from lower on the anatomy, which they often do, but what really gets
3174520	3177160	the audience engaged is when they care about the characters.
3177160	3184440	In this case, it was Niles' feelings that you cared about.
3184440	3188040	Niles and Daphne are probably the most important relationship in the series, being the only
3188040	3191480	long-running story arc that lasts throughout the whole show, and one that was featured
3191480	3193680	in its most watched episode.
3193680	3197160	Niles and Daphne first meet in the third episode of the series, Dinner at Eight.
3197160	3201320	Although Daphne happily acknowledges him, Niles' reaction is a bit more extreme.
3201320	3214520	The
3214520	3220280	complication here is that Niles is very much a married man to the unseen Maris, which doesn't
3220280	3222440	stop him from making certain overtures.
3222440	3243000	The Niles and Daphne relationship would continue like this in the early seasons of
3243000	3245920	the show, though at first it wasn't supposed to happen at all.
3245920	3249480	In interviews, David Hyde Pierce would tell the story of how, while doing press for the
3249480	3252880	show before production began, Jane Leves would mention the idea that perhaps Daphne
3252880	3254360	and Niles should get together.
3254360	3257000	This manifested on the writing side in its own way.
3257000	3260880	Writer-producer, N. Fletch Giordano, explains an encounter with series producer, Christopher
3260880	3261880	Lloyd.
3261880	3264280	Early in the first season, Niles comes to the apartment.
3264280	3267840	Chris, realizing that Niles would be meeting Daphne for the first time, said, what if he
3267840	3269920	had a crazy crush on her?
3269920	3274360	And it was here this multi-year crush began, with many delightful misunderstandings.
3274360	3275360	This is one of me psychic headaches.
3275360	3276360	There's some kind of negative force out there.
3276360	3277360	I only get these when there's a clawing at the cosmic continuum.
3277360	3278360	Perhaps if someone robbed your temples, that's...
3278360	3279360	By goodness, Dr. Crane, shouldn't you be out there mixing?
3279360	3280360	Oh, don't mind me.
3280360	3281360	I'm just getting some ice.
3281360	3282360	Lovely party.
3282360	3283360	Dr. Crane is always dropping by and bringing me little gifts, and he's not after anything.
3283360	3308200	Although charming in their execution, there's something a bit strange about a married man
3308200	3310720	drooling over his father's physical therapist.
3310720	3314840	Though it might make Niles appear like a brute to his wife, David Hyde Pierce performed
3314840	3317720	the character in a way that made his love for Maris clear.
3317720	3319360	Writer Joe Keenan explains.
3319360	3323120	No matter how ludicrous our descriptions got, David made Niles' feelings about the marriage
3323120	3324120	very real.
3324120	3327840	He knew that if Niles didn't love Maris, there'd be no reason for us to care when she divorced
3327840	3330960	him, or for Niles to feel conflicted and hide his love for Daphne.
3330960	3335280	That can be seen in episodes such as, An Affair to Forget, where Niles confronts Maris'
3335280	3340360	fencing instructor, Gunnar, over an affair Niles suspects Gunnar is having with Maris.
3340360	3353960	Luckily for Niles, he finds out Maris has remained faithful.
3353960	3358240	The early flirtations between Niles and Daphne happen with the spectre of Maris around them.
3358240	3361840	In spite of that barrier to them being together, there's still an obvious chemistry between
3361840	3362840	them.
3362840	3366720	In the first seasons, a midwinter night's dream, a storm traps Daphne at Niles' mansion
3366720	3386080	while Maris is in Arizona.
3386080	3391960	As Niles comforts Daphne after a recent breakup, things get heated.
3391960	3406760	Dr. Crane, your glockenspielers sprung to life.
3406760	3413000	Oh, the clock!
3413000	3416480	Maris.
3416480	3419840	You really loafer, don't you?
3419840	3424680	You know, I do.
3424680	3427020	Love is a funny thing, isn't it?
3427020	3432520	Sometimes it's exciting and passionate, and sometimes it's something else.
3432520	3434960	Something comfortable and familiar.
3434960	3438040	David Hyde Pierce describes Niles' attraction to Daphne, saying,
3438040	3442320	I think she's just an exotic flower to him, and she's so beautiful and it's so unusual
3442320	3445960	for him to be treated by a woman with such friendliness that he's overwhelmed by that
3445960	3449280	openness because Maris is so manipulative and difficult.
3449280	3453280	Niles and Maris' marriage over the years deteriorates, leading to separation and then
3453280	3454280	eventually divorce.
3454280	3459200	It never sounded particularly happy, but whatever it was, was enough for Niles.
3459200	3463160	That is, until the arrival of Daphne, which introduced something new and different to
3463160	3464160	him.
3464160	3467720	At first, it could simply be the echo of a wealthy man lusting after a woman of a lower
3467720	3472560	class, a very old trope, and seen in classic works of literature such as Pamela.
3472560	3476600	Class has a very strange place in this relationship though, as we never see Niles consider Daphne
3476600	3477600	beneath him.
3477600	3480560	Rather, he just seems her as different and enticing.
3480560	3484560	The timing of Niles and Maris' divorce, a few years after the arrival of Daphne, does
3484560	3488680	suggest that the idea of something more may have fueled its end at some level, though
3488680	3490600	the series never makes that explicit.
3490600	3495160	The closest sign we get is when, during his separation, Niles takes Daphne to a ball in
3495160	3496920	the episode Moon Dance.
3496920	3500600	What started off as an evening to show Niles' friends he wasn't sulking over Maris becomes
3500600	3501600	something more than that.
3501600	3526600	Niles is on the cusp of getting swept away with Daphne until he learns the truth.
3531600	3552240	A crucial part of this episode is that Niles brought Daphne to impress his snooty, high
3552240	3553480	society friends.
3553480	3557160	The idea that Niles would show up with someone of a lower class to impress a bunch of snobs
3557160	3561200	doesn't really make sense, though it does reveal that, when it comes to Daphne, Niles
3561200	3564200	sees her for more than who she is in her social standing.
3564200	3566920	To her being a beautiful woman, I'm sure helps as well.
3566920	3570480	Although Niles clearly has romantic feelings for Daphne, part of what keeps it from getting
3570480	3574020	too creepy is that, ultimately, he cares about her as a person.
3574020	3577200	He may want to be with her, but he also wants her to be happy.
3577200	3581640	Before his divorce with Maris, we see this in the episode Kisses Sweeter Than Wine.
3581640	3584680	This reluctantly helps Daphne connect with his handyman, Joe.
3611640	3619360	Next season, when Daphne breaks up with Joe for good, the separated Niles and Daphne have
3619360	3620360	a nice talk.
3620360	3650240	Unrequited love is
3650240	3652040	one of the oldest tropes in English literature.
3652040	3655760	It can be traced back to the medieval concept of courtly love, which would often entail
3655760	3659400	a man's desire for an unavailable woman, although when it comes to women of a lower
3659400	3663800	class, whether or not she's unavailable never quite enters into the equation.
3663800	3666920	In this instance, it actually subverts that expectation.
3666920	3670480	Niles doesn't see Daphne as a lower class woman he can take advantage of, but as an
3670480	3673520	equal, or someone even greater than himself.
3673520	3677040	It's a bit strange to square the idea that Daphne, who clearly understands and cares
3677040	3680880	for Niles as a friend, is still somehow oblivious to his attraction towards her.
3680880	3695640	Jane Leaves explains why from her own perspective.
3695640	3700160	This old trope of pining for an oblivious woman can create many great episodes and moments,
3700160	3703800	as the series so easily demonstrates, but it does also carry with it a more pernicious
3703800	3706640	element, and that's the objectification of Daphne.
3706640	3710080	By objectification, I don't mean in the more commonly understood sense of highlighting
3710080	3712440	a woman's physical form over her character.
3712440	3715000	Daphne wasn't really objectified in that way.
3715000	3716880	At least, not that often.
3716880	3720880	What I mean is all those delightful moments where Niles fawns over an oblivious Daphne
3720880	3749640	are effectively removing her from the scene as a full character.
3749640	3752920	When Niles and Daphne have one of these cute little moments, there are two conversations
3752920	3753920	happening.
3753920	3757800	The obvious one, in which Daphne is showing Niles how to blow a smoke ring, and the subtextual
3757800	3760400	one of Niles getting turned on by Daphne.
3760400	3763920	In many of these moments, these scenes don't just include Daphne and Niles, but also have
3763920	3767260	Fraser Martin present to underscore what's going on.
3767260	3771160	It isn't just Niles drifting off into a world of fantasy, it's a secret conversation
3771160	3773120	happening between the Crane men.
3773120	3777040	Even a conversation that's little more than a few weighted glances.
3777040	3780800	Even at the two layers of these moments, Niles and the other men operate on both, while
3780800	3782960	Daphne only operates on one.
3782960	3787120	In that second later, she is present, but not as an active participant, but rather an
3787120	3791680	unthinking element to be played against, like a prop, or an object.
3791680	3795640	The show itself acknowledges this dynamic in the episode, Perspectives on Christmas, where
3795640	3799640	each of the characters describe a disastrous Christmas from their own points of view.
3799640	3811360	Here's how Martin observed one of those moments.
3811360	3824520	And here's how that same moment played out from Daphne's perspective.
3824520	3828080	And the show certainly doesn't shy away from making fun of her with moments like this.
3828080	3849760	In the early seasons, this was a common trend for Daphne, unfortunately.
3849760	3853600	She was such a charmingly offbeat character that existed purely as you saw her, without
3853600	3855280	much of an interior life.
3855280	3858360	Even stories that focused on her, such as her having her boyfriend spend the night at
3858360	3862580	Frasier's apartment with her, ended up becoming stories more focused on other characters,
3862580	3866360	in this case Frasier and his anxiety about Daphne having a man over.
3866360	3868320	This can be seen in a comment from Christopher Lloyd.
3868320	3871160	He's describing why Niles and Daphne work as a couple.
3871160	3874200	I thought, could it be because she's so different than he is?
3874200	3876560	He's upper class, and she's working class.
3876560	3879560	She says what's on her mind, and he's restrained and thoughtful.
3879560	3883280	Jane Lees did have some say in making Daphne a more interesting character over the years,
3883280	3884960	even filling in some of her backstory.
3884960	3886240	She explained in an interview,
3886240	3888340	Daphne was like a pair of comfy shoes.
3888340	3891200	She had a sort of earthiness and honesty that definitely came from me.
3891200	3894320	I told the writers that a girl who's comfortable around these men, who doesn't take any of
3894320	3897280	their crap, must come from a household filled with men.
3897280	3901520	In one of the more ironic twists of the series, by being actively pursued by Niles, instead
3901520	3905760	of him just loving her from afar, Daphne started to become a more well-rounded character.
3905760	3909740	As Niles' divorce with Maris starts to get messy, he decides to change his legal representation
3909740	3914560	from a high-priced law firm to one of Roz's ex-boyfriends, Donnie Douglas, played by Sol
3914560	3915560	Rubinec.
3915560	3919200	And while he offers an immediate reversal of fortune for Niles' finances, netting
3919200	3923440	him a nice settlement, Donnie's presence also has another unexpected consequence.
3923440	3925040	Who understands why anything happens?
3925040	3932960	I mean, it's remarkable how completely one's life can change in an instant.
3932960	3933960	Poor Niles.
3933960	3937740	It's over the next season and a half, things start getting messy, with Donnie and Daphne
3937740	3942680	getting engaged, and Niles starting to date Mel, played by Jane Addams, a plastic surgeon
3942680	3949400	who had worked extensively on Maris.
3949400	3959200	One day though, a pulled muscle in Frasier's back changes everything.
3959200	3963080	While he's sitting in, and of all places, Martin's chair, Frasier ruminates about
3963080	3966160	his life.
3966160	3994920	A terrified Daphne tries to confirm the issue with Martin.
3994920	3999980	After taking some medication, Frasier asks Daphne for a massage, which gets pretty awkward,
3999980	4019240	but eventually the misunderstanding is partially revealed.
4019240	4045240	And everything is fine, until the meds Frasier took start to kick in.
4045240	4049080	Frasier doesn't remember spilling the beans, and it appears Daphne has learned the truth
4049080	4051400	with everyone else, none the wiser.
4051400	4068360	But Niles is a little more astute than everyone else.
4068360	4071560	While dating Donnie, Daphne had gradually been revealing more of herself.
4071560	4075340	We learned more about her life in Manchester, and about the things that made her happy.
4075340	4078740	But this is the moment that really made her come to life as a character.
4078740	4082260	Maybe it's the simple fact that having a secret reveals an interior of her life, and
4082260	4084860	one that puts her on par with the other characters around her.
4084860	4088620	In some ways, it even gives her an edge, since they don't know that she knows the truth
4088620	4090220	about Niles' feelings for her.
4090220	4093300	We can see that inversion very clearly in moments where Daphne and Niles have their
4093300	4119900	roles reversed in those little moments of subtext.
4119900	4146780	It's fitting that Niles, being an old-handed this, can sense something is a mess.
4146780	4150540	Things finally reach a boiling point with the Season 7 finale and two-parter, something
4150540	4152700	borrowed, someone blue.
4152700	4162660	Daphne's wedding is fast approaching, and she needs to get some things off her chest.
4162660	4182100	She needs to get some things off her chest, and she needs to get some things off her
4182100	4183100	chest.
4183100	4211740	Unfortunately for Daphne, Niles and Mel have some news of their own.
4211740	4215820	Before the wedding, Fraser notices how Niles and Daphne look at one another, and he decides
4215820	4236460	to confront Niles.
4236460	4260780	This gives Niles the courage to finally tell Daphne the truth.
4260780	4277900	10 minutes later, she finally responds.
4277900	4302340	Although the episodes seem to end with Daphne deciding she can't leave Donnie, luckily
4302340	4317820	for all of us, we still got a happy ending.
4317820	4322620	After seven long years of seeing Niles and Daphne go from awkward flirtation to a romantic
4322620	4326420	escape, it felt as though this story was reaching its climax, and that was reflected in the
4326420	4331180	ratings as this was the most watched episode of Fraser, seen by nearly 34 million people
4331180	4334620	in the United States.
4334620	4337620	When Niles kisses Daphne for the first time, it gave me goosebumps.
4337620	4341140	I had lived with these characters for so long, as did the audience, and wanted that moment
4341140	4342260	for them.
4342260	4353020	And David Hyde Pierce shares this experience of the moment, saying,
4353020	4357180	Love stories often don't extend beyond the moment when two people finally get together,
4357180	4359720	and we simply expect them to live happily ever after.
4359720	4363680	But love isn't so simple in real life, and sometimes the hardest stories to tell aren't
4363680	4368040	about how a couple gets together, but rather how that couple stays together.
4368040	4371680	The moment when Daphne and Niles get together is often cited as where Fraser starts going
4371680	4376560	downhill, and while ratings did begin to decline, I would argue the quality was still certainly
4376560	4380080	there, only we weren't getting any more of those moments of hidden desire leading to
4380080	4381960	a comedic misunderstanding.
4381960	4384640	We were going to see how this couple dealt with the idea of changing their lives on the
4384640	4388680	spot for a chance at a love that might only come once in a lifetime.
4389680	4394160	When Niles and Daphne finally got together, there was a certain tension gone that had
4394160	4397080	been sustaining the series in ways we didn't understand.
4397080	4400600	When the eighth season began, it picked up right where the finale left off, with Niles
4400600	4403720	and Daphne figuring out how to navigate lives they had just destroyed.
4403720	4406880	Leaving your fiancé on your wedding day, and divorcing your wife on the fourth day
4406880	4409880	of marriage, does create some feelings of resentment.
4409880	4413280	These obstacles would be dealt with over the next couple of episodes, but I want to highlight
4413280	4414520	another important moment.
4418680	4432760	Although Daphne had been close with the Cranes, it's only now we see her being treated more
4432760	4433760	like family.
4433760	4436760	It's also a clear indicator that Fraser sees her as an equal.
4436760	4439120	She effectively marries into a higher class.
4439120	4442160	The episode even ends with Martin and Fraser putting together a special dinner for the
4442160	4443160	new couple.
4443160	4447040	The biggest challenge to the Niles and Daphne relationship is how devoid it is of any real
4447040	4449020	tension that it might end.
4449020	4452560	No one can doubt for a second that Niles is hopelessly devoted to her, and Daphne seems
4452560	4454400	to be quite taken with him as well.
4454400	4458440	The show plays a little with this idea when the stress of looking up to Niles' expectations
4458440	4461520	leads Daphne to gain a significant amount of weight.
4461520	4464600	Behind the scenes this was done to accommodate Jane Leaves' pregnancy, but it did raise
4464600	4468000	some interesting questions about how two people can date when so much of it is based on a
4468000	4470560	love that was built on years of pining.
4470560	4490280	How can reality ever live up to that?
4490280	4494840	Although Niles takes this revelation personally and the two have their first fight, they reconcile
4494840	4498280	before the end of the episode, and the two manage to stay together for the rest of the
4498280	4499280	series.
4499400	4503240	The episodes for Niles and Daphne that stand out the most are like this one though.
4503240	4507280	Ones where tension arises and the relationship is threatened, but at this point in the series
4507280	4511680	it's unthinkable that these two would ever break up, and what tension is created is undercut
4511680	4512680	because of that.
4512680	4517740	There's no will they or won't they, it's very clear that they will, and have.
4517740	4521000	In the same way Niles is utterly committed to Daphne, the show is utterly committed to
4521000	4525080	making this relationship work, spending years showing how Niles longs for her, using moments
4525080	4528600	to reveal how good the two of them are together, and revealing how much they've always cared
4528600	4529600	for one another.
4529600	4532520	Although it's certainly possible to tell interesting stories about how a couple stays
4532520	4536080	together, the series had the added pressure of years of buildup that might have felt like
4536080	4540080	a cruel tease had Niles and Daphne broken up a year or two after getting together.
4540080	4553320	By season 9 in the episode, The Proposal, we get exactly that.
4553320	4566720	Instead of a big lavish wedding, Niles and Daphne end up eloping in Las Vegas.
4566720	4570600	The threats to Niles and Daphne are often external to the relationship, such as when
4570600	4591000	Niles faces a medical emergency and is rushed to the hospital for an operation.
4591000	4595040	There's also the return of Maris, who re-enters Niles' life after she accidentally murders
4595040	4603960	her two boyfriend with a crossbow.
4603960	4607560	The Niles and Daphne relationship is one that was defined by tension, and once that inner
4607560	4612200	tension was resolved, went on to face a series of tensions from outside the relationship,
4612200	4613960	always chasing that earlier feeling.
4613960	4617640	Although Niles and Daphne are lovely together, their on-screen dynamic only occasionally
4617640	4619200	explored that relationship.
4619200	4623800	Instead, we had exes, near-death experiences, and murderers threatening to tear these two
4623800	4624800	apart.
4624800	4628320	When Daphne and Niles had grown so much to be together, their relationship never quite
4628320	4629980	managed to do the same.
4629980	4633800	When people say Fraser changed after Niles and Daphne got together, they're right,
4633800	4635800	and change doesn't have to be a bad thing.
4635800	4641060	But when you go to a show, in part, for the exciting romantic tension, and it's all gone,
4641060	4643720	you can't help but feel as though something has been lost.
4643720	4648280	And the new thing might appear hollow if it seems to be an imitation of the old thing.
4648280	4653600	There is something to be said for seeing a happy couple together instead of one in constant
4653600	4654600	conflict.
4654600	4657380	It just wasn't as enthralling as the pursuit.
4657380	4660920	It also highlights another way in which class manifests itself in the series.
4660920	4663160	Daphne and Niles, on paper, shouldn't work.
4663160	4666640	He's a rich psychiatrist, and she's a kooky physical therapist.
4666640	4669000	But it does work, in spite of this class divide.
4669000	4671960	And it serves as a reminder that true love is possible when you're willing to ignore
4671960	4675260	the things that don't matter, in this case, social class.
4675260	4680200	Because doing so opens a door to meeting someone who represents a whole new world of possibilities.
4680200	4681800	Jane Lees describes it.
4681800	4684760	She is the complete opposite of anything he's ever known.
4684760	4688320	She's grounded and down to earth, and that's just not the sort of person he's used to.
4688320	4690480	She's not out for herself like everybody else.
4690480	4692080	She's there to help others.
4692080	4695480	And it turns him on to see her rooting around under the sink and fixing things.
4695480	4698920	The only real journey left for them to take together is the one to parenthood.
4698920	4712320	Although this is Daphne's first child, in a way this is Niles' second.
4712320	4725920	Though the show never did answer what happened to that little bag of flour.
4725920	4731920	Or maybe we do now.
4731920	4736680	Frasier was rightfully lauded as having a very strong record on depicting gay characters,
4736680	4738600	often tackling stereotypes head-on.
4738600	4740240	David Hyde Pierce explains.
4740240	4742520	It was never jokes at the expense of gay people.
4742520	4744360	We had gay people on staff.
4744360	4748240	David Lee, one of the creators on the show, is gay, and so, to me, it was always acknowledging
4748240	4751000	the preposterousness of stereotypes.
4751000	4755000	This dynamic was, while explained in Matt Baum's excellent video, Frasier and sitcoms
4755000	4758040	of the gay 90s, so give it a watch if you'd like to learn more about that.
4758040	4761520	Instead, I'd like to talk about some other forms of representation on the series.
4761520	4765520	NBC's lineup of sitcoms throughout much of the 90s, which Frasier was a part of on
4765520	4769920	Thursday's nights, was overwhelmingly white, and this wasn't an accident.
4769920	4773840	One of the executive producers of The Fresh Prince of the Balair, Andy Burrowitz, described
4773840	4777520	what it was like to be producing one of the few sitcoms for NBC on primetime that had a
4777520	4779000	black cast.
4779000	4782880	The knee-jerk response in the network was, maybe we need more cast members on the show.
4782880	4786840	They never said white, but curiously, all the characters they proposed were white.
4786840	4789920	They believed a white audience wouldn't watch a black show.
4789920	4794680	This came after programs including The Cosby Show and The Jeffersons demonstrated the opposite,
4794680	4798560	but with cable channels attracting more of that TV audience, big networks such as NBC
4798560	4802320	started trying to appeal more to that white audience the only way they knew how, making
4802320	4804760	shows predominantly featuring white people.
4804760	4809000	None of this is to say that Frasier was a show built specifically to appeal to white
4809000	4813600	people, but it's certainly a fact that its makeup was a perfect fit for NBC, reflected
4813600	4817900	in as simple a change as suggesting the Latina housekeeper on the show's original pitch
4817900	4819720	instead be an Englishwoman.
4819720	4824280	Frasier had a strange relationship with race, in that it says very little about it, and
4824280	4828100	the one time it does, we get the episode, Something About Dr. Mary.
4828100	4832800	In this episode, Frasier's temporary replacement for Roz, Mary, played by Kim Coles, starts
4832800	4836640	getting too comfortable participating in the show, and Frasier feels too awkward to tell
4836640	4851400	her to ease up a little.
4851400	4856000	Interestingly enough, in this season 7 episode, the first one to ever mention race, we get
4856000	4860200	this line.
4860200	4864800	A scene with three white men talking about how, perhaps, white people are being too sensitive
4864800	4867900	about racial issues, is a very 90s moment.
4867900	4871640	We also have Frasier acting out a paranoid white guy fantasy of what it's like to disagree
4871640	4899880	with a black woman.
4900080	4925280	Frasier comes clean and confesses the truth to Mary, who, of course, takes it all in stride.
4925280	4929320	All ends well as Mary's interjections made her so popular she's offered her own show.
4929320	4933240	A show with a white cast talking about race isn't impossible to do well.
4933240	4937560	A few years prior, Roseanne did a masterful job with White Men Can't Kiss.
4937560	4941120	Frasier is a sad reminder, though, that these topics can be clumsily handled in the hands
4941120	4944880	of a creative team, completely divorced from the experiences they're speaking to.
4944880	4948980	Though it does reflect quite nicely the misplaced anxieties certain white people might feel
4948980	4950340	when discussing race.
4950340	4953400	The show did fare slightly better over the years, introducing the less stereotypical
4953400	4958280	character of Cam Winston, and having his mother Cora have a brief relationship with Martin.
4958280	4962560	But these are characters for whom race is incidental, and they neatly fit into Frasier's
4962560	4963900	upper class world.
4963900	4968040	Another uncomfortable blind slot is the character of Maris, which only makes sense because we
4968040	4969040	never see her.
4969040	4973160	The show goes out of its way to describe how odd she is, being an heiress who is constantly
4973160	4977320	engaging in surgeries and beauty treatments to keep herself looking young and beautiful.
4977320	4981800	In the episode, To Thine Old's Self Be True, we find out Maris has been struggling with
4981800	4987280	an eating disorder.
4987280	4990920	The episode includes much discussion about how Maris has gained so much weight that she's
4990920	4993880	gone from dangerously thin to dangerously overweight.
4993880	5002920	In both cases, it's played for a laugh.
5002920	5007000	Not being able to see Maris has always made it easy to create this bizarre entity to drive
5007000	5008000	comedy.
5008000	5011560	But if we could see her in this moment, eating away her misery that Niles has moved on without
5011560	5014960	her, I imagine we'd probably feel more pity than anything else.
5014960	5018960	It puts in stark relief all the other times Maris was described as being too light to
5018960	5022640	leave footprints in the snow, or her weight being so smaller in her youth that Frasier
5022640	5024320	was amazed she was even alive.
5024320	5028680	A person that small and frail probably wouldn't be nearly as funny if you saw her in the flesh.
5028680	5031520	And you could see what her eating disorder is doing to her.
5031520	5035520	This, along with Frasier's record on race, underscores one of the sad truths about the
5035520	5036520	series.
5036520	5040120	It's a show about white men that struggles to see anything outside that perspective,
5040120	5043880	and by not acknowledging those other perspectives makes Hei out of struggles that feel like
5043880	5045160	laughing down.
5045160	5048760	What keeps these episodes from getting too uncomfortable is how class acts as something
5048760	5051000	of a barrier to disguise what's happening.
5051000	5054800	In something about Dr. Mary, it can be argued that the comedy comes from Frasier's lack
5054800	5059360	of perspective outside of his upper class world, even if the Mary character reads like
5059360	5060360	a stereotype.
5060360	5064640	In the case of Maris, her obscene wealth makes her far less empathetic a character, even
5064640	5066840	though her disorder is incredibly tragic.
5066840	5070800	In both cases, it's the status of the characters that informs the audience that it's okay
5070800	5072480	to laugh at what's happening.
5072480	5076600	It's another way in which class is a barrier to feeling empathy, something core to the
5076600	5077600	character of Frasier.
5077600	5080800	I'm certainly not saying we shouldn't laugh at the rich and powerful.
5080800	5084520	In fact, I'd say we should err on the side of laughing at them more.
5084520	5089120	But it is worth considering why we're laughing, whether it's for the silly excesses of the
5089120	5098760	wealthy or the problems that impact people across class lines.
5098760	5103600	Roz Doyle is a tough character to pin down, particularly in the beginning of the series.
5103600	5107160	Frasier needed someone to interact with as part of his radio show, but only a few small
5107160	5109360	details about the character really existed.
5109360	5112600	When Perry Gilpin got the role, she was told by the creative team that they weren't really
5112600	5117160	sure who Roz was as a character, leaving her wide open to the actress' interpretation.
5117160	5118840	Gilpin once said in an interview,
5118840	5122080	I imagined Roz constantly trying to live up to a forceful mother.
5122080	5124800	I actually based a lot of her on a really good friend of mine.
5124800	5129040	She's super smart, self-dependent, sexually adventurous, and honest about it.
5129040	5132040	Although this might have led her to evolve into a cliche, she managed to be a sexually
5132040	5135200	active career woman without becoming a negative stereotype.
5135200	5139680	In the episode, Roz and the Dog House, we see Bulldog, the perpetual sexual harasser
5139680	5142760	at the station, appeal to Roz for her producing talents.
5142760	5146680	I did not sleep with Bulldog, he didn't even hit on me.
5146680	5151640	He didn't want something though, wanted me to leave you and come be his new producer.
5151640	5156560	Well, I wonder why he said that.
5156560	5160160	Eventually we find out Roz's suspicions to be true, and Roz is quick to stand up to
5160160	5161160	Bulldog.
5161160	5162160	Get out!
5162160	5165160	I'll show you how to work, you disgusting farmer!
5165160	5166160	Hey, hey, hey!
5166160	5167160	You're gonna have to slow down!
5167160	5169480	I'm getting some mixed signals here.
5169480	5173800	The lesson, almost learned here, was for Roz to respect the talent of his producer, as
5173800	5177200	we did see how talented Roz was in helping improve Bulldog's show.
5177200	5180960	But it's undercut by the reality that, in spite of her skills, Roz was still reduced
5180960	5183540	to her sexual appeal by both of her bosses.
5183540	5186640	This is something of a running theme for the character in the early seasons, and while
5186640	5190480	it puts her on par with Frasier and Niles, who often end up being humiliated by people
5190480	5193920	who know better, it hits a bit different when it's someone who doesn't have the same
5193920	5195920	degree of power or status.
5195920	5199240	Of all the characters on the show, it's Roz who is the most detached from the rest of
5199240	5200240	the cast.
5200240	5203760	Much like Daphne in the earlier seasons, Roz isn't highlighted the way many of the crane
5203760	5207560	men are, sometimes reduced to only having one or two scenes in an episode.
5207560	5210720	Unlike Daphne, she doesn't get the same opportunity of character growth when she
5210720	5214560	becomes involved with Niles, often leaving Roz as the odd one out.
5214560	5217560	The most meaningful connection Roz has to the rest of the cast is her friendship with
5217560	5235280	Frasier, although this does get teased as them being more than friends multiple times.
5235280	5238120	Aside from one night where they hook up, the two of them never come close to anything
5238120	5239120	romantic.
5239120	5241800	The relationship simply works best with them being friends.
5241800	5244940	The friendship between Roz and Frasier is a bit different.
5244940	5248520	Not just because of the class divide, but because Frasier is Roz's boss.
5248520	5252640	It leads to some strange moments, such as the episode Roz alone, where Frasier loans
5252640	5262240	Roz some money, and then becomes very judgmental when he sees how she spends it.
5262240	5278600	Daphne is luckily there to point out how Frasier's loan of $1500 contrasts his usual
5278600	5300360	spending habits.
5300360	5304200	It's also worth mentioning that Roz being on hard times is because Frasier got her,
5304200	5309000	and everyone else at KACL, fired when he made his stand against the station manager.
5309000	5320640	Frasier eventually confronts Roz about her spending habits.
5320640	5325200	Even their reconciliation is kind of weird, as Roz is forced to listen to Frasier's apology
5325200	5353120	because she's his producer and he's doing it on the air.
5353120	5355680	These power dynamics come up several times throughout the series.
5355680	5359840	Frasier and Roz are absolutely friends, but they aren't quite on the same level.
5359840	5363360	The tension in this relationship always seems to come from the fact that Frasier has power
5363360	5367080	over Roz, and reveals the perils of friendships within hierarchies.
5367080	5370640	It's not as simple as saying, no one can ever be friends with their boss, that's obviously
5370640	5371640	not true.
5371640	5375560	Rather, what the series suggests is that this dynamic presents a barrier or obstacle in
5375560	5376640	that friendship.
5376640	5380720	In season 9, Roz meets Roger, a man who would be one of her longest romantic partners on
5380720	5381720	the show.
5381720	5385640	There are some echoes of class in that relationship as Roger is a garbage man, something that
5385640	5389640	at first embarrasses Roz, but over time she learns to accept it.
5389640	5392320	By the end of the season, sadly they've broken up.
5392320	5411360	Although Frasier tries to reach out to her, she insists she's fine.
5411360	5415720	The rest of this episode, titled Frasier has Spokane, focuses on Frasier's expanding
5415720	5419560	to the Spokane market, and him struggling to be accepted by the listeners there.
5419560	5423040	Roz is enlisted to help out, posing as a caller looking for help.
5453040	5474880	Frasier and Roz have a very real connection, and it reveals the workplace friendships are
5474880	5476640	just as valid as any other.
5476640	5479000	Working together was never the problem for Frasier and Roz.
5479000	5483520	Roz having to answer to Frasier as her boss was what introduced a power dynamic that undercut
5483520	5486080	what is otherwise a very meaningful friendship.
5486080	5489560	This is a reflection of what I was saying earlier about Frasier and how class creates
5489560	5492000	barriers between him and the people he cares about.
5492000	5496200	Roz is clearly no exception, and while it does provide an interesting reading for her
5496200	5500200	character, it does frame the Frasier and Roz friendship as less about her story and more
5500200	5501580	about his.
5501580	5505280	There was one storyline for Roz that was all her own, and that was the birth of her daughter
5505280	5506280	Alice.
5506280	5509440	The birth of Alice was not planned by Roz, or even the show's producers.
5509440	5511160	Christopher Lloyd in an interview said,
5511160	5512680	It was the network's idea.
5512680	5515880	It's one of those things because they like doing event shows.
5515880	5519920	And so in the season 5 episode Halloween, we find out Roz is expecting.
5519920	5523560	And as is tradition for the show, it's revealed in the most embarrassing way possible.
5523560	5527160	If anybody's going to propose to Roz as Frasier, how could you do that?
5527160	5528160	Get her pregnant?
5528160	5529160	It was Frasier.
5529160	5532160	Listen, everybody, I am not the father of Roz's baby.
5532160	5536040	In fact, we don't even know for sure if there is a baby.
5536040	5539880	We do now.
5539880	5543760	The father is a young barista working at Cafe Nervosa, who Roz encourages to go live his
5543760	5546320	life as she intends to raise the baby on her own.
5546320	5551080	I hope that you can understand why I can't possibly marry you.
5551080	5554160	When I get married, it's going to be to someone I love.
5554160	5556700	And someone who loves me.
5556700	5561040	And someone who can legally drink champagne at my wedding.
5561040	5563040	Okay.
5564040	5566040	I understand.
5566040	5570040	Although Roz doesn't think this is going to be as easy to handle as she lets on.
5570040	5573040	I can't take this.
5573040	5574040	Damn it.
5574040	5576040	I've let this happen.
5576040	5580040	Are we still talking about the milk?
5580040	5582040	Don't you see?
5582040	5584040	Milk is a staple.
5584040	5587040	I let a staple go bad.
5587040	5589040	Good mothers don't let stables go bad.
5589040	5593040	How can I be responsible for a child when I can't even keep fresh milk in the house?
5593040	5595040	Kids need milk.
5595040	5598040	I have to know everything.
5598040	5599040	You can know half of everything.
5599040	5602040	You can know about the milk and Lilith can know about the booties and the snugglies.
5602040	5605040	You never met Lilith, did you?
5605040	5610040	What seemed to be the beginning of Roz's character moving in a new direction never quite gets off the ground,
5610040	5616040	as even the delivery of the baby is almost smuggled into an episode about Frasier and Niles competing over the same woman at a party.
5616040	5617040	What is wrong with me?
5617040	5618040	What is wrong with me?
5618040	5620040	Why can't I find a single woman who's interested in me?
5620040	5622040	Those are two different questions, really.
5622040	5625040	So we should just sit down and talk them both over.
5625040	5626040	Oh wait, I can't.
5626040	5628040	Because I'm in labor!
5628040	5631040	Still, we do get a cute moment with baby Alice.
5631040	5634040	Oh, look at her.
5634040	5636040	Oh, she's beautiful.
5636040	5639040	Mazel tov.
5639040	5641040	It's a long story.
5641040	5642040	And that was about it.
5642040	5648040	On the odd occasion, we would see Alice appear in an episode or Roz would make a reference to having to stay home because she couldn't find a babysitter.
5648040	5654040	But otherwise, we don't get too much of a change in Roz's life, aside from maybe her dating habits slowing down a bit.
5654040	5658040	One interesting bit of trivia about Roz Doyle is that she gets her name from one of the producers on Wings,
5658040	5661040	the show David Angel, Peter Casey, and David Lee created before Frasier.
5661040	5665040	The real-life Roz Doyle passed away in 1991 from breast cancer.
5665040	5671040	Towards the end of the series, we see some development in sight for Roz as she's offered a job as station manager at a rival radio station.
5671040	5674040	I must say, I've got sort of mixed feelings about this.
5674040	5675040	I mean, I couldn't be happier.
5675040	5679040	They're finally getting the recognition you deserve, but I'm going to miss you.
5679040	5684040	Well, let's wait till there's a real offer before we break out the Kleenex and Champagne.
5684040	5686040	Roz, being so capable, gets the job.
5686040	5688040	Well, I got the job!
5688040	5689040	Oh, congratulations, Roz.
5689040	5690040	I'm so proud of you.
5690040	5692040	Now, can I tell you how much I'm going to miss you?
5692040	5693040	Yes.
5693040	5698040	This two-parter is a strange dynamic where Roz inserts herself into Frasier's new relationship with co-worker Julia,
5698040	5699040	played by Felicity Huffman.
5699040	5701040	Though, ultimately, none of this goes anywhere.
5701040	5707040	Frasier breaks things off with Julia, and Roz exits the new job to go back to her old one at KACL.
5707040	5713040	While a bit of an odd part of the show, it does reveal to us that Roz aspires to be something more than a producer for Frasier's show.
5713040	5716040	And that's something we learn a little more about in the finale of the series.
5722040	5727040	One major part of the series I haven't really touched on is Frasier's long-standing problems with dating.
5727040	5732040	Throughout the over 250 episodes of the show, we see Frasier go on countless dates,
5732040	5736040	struggling to find happiness with women that are a bad fit for him, a great fit for him,
5736040	5739040	and ones who don't stick around long enough for us to find out.
5739040	5742040	Frasier's struggle to find a relationship is one of the core conflicts of the series.
5742040	5749040	Season 9 opens with the two-parter Don Juan in Hell, where Frasier dives deep into his own mind to figure out what he wants,
5749040	5752040	imagining the many women who he's had relationships with.
5752040	5758040	I have carried you with me throughout every relationship, on every date.
5758040	5763040	You pick apart the women I care about and you remind me how much it'll hurt if I open myself up.
5765040	5766040	You don't help me.
5767040	5768040	You hold me back.
5768040	5774040	How will I ever move forward if I don't put you behind me?
5774040	5780040	Although this two-parter led Frasier to a place of emotional strength, ready to enter into a meaningful relationship,
5780040	5784040	it would be two more seasons until he found the last of the women he would earnestly pursue on the series.
5784040	5786040	Charlotte, played by Laura Linney.
5786040	5789040	We only meet Charlotte seven episodes before the series finale,
5789040	5792040	but Linney spoke about the experience of joining the cast so late in its run.
5792040	5794040	I was a Frasier fan for so long.
5794040	5798040	I think Charlotte's a good-hearted fumbling person trying her best, but things weren't working,
5798040	5800040	and she was beginning to lose heart a little bit.
5800040	5805040	In a fitting turn, Charlotte met Frasier while trying to help him make a meaningful connection as a matchmaker.
5806040	5810040	After setting up a series of disastrous dates, Frasier realizes he's attracted to Charlotte.
5818040	5823040	After some brief maneuvering around Charlotte's less-than-ideal boyfriend Frank, played by Aaron Eckhart,
5823040	5827040	Frasier manages to get closer to Charlotte, until finding out something crucial.
5835040	5839040	I know I should have told you sooner, but it was never the right time.
5839040	5842040	Frasier and Charlotte decide to spend the last three weeks she has together,
5842040	5847040	and that time is drawing to a close in the final episode, two-parter, Goodnight Seattle.
5847040	5852040	As the episode begins, we can see the cast all reaching pivotal turning points in their lives.
5852040	5856040	Martin and Ronnie, having gotten engaged a few episodes earlier, are planning their wedding.
5856040	5860040	A very pregnant Daphne could give birth at any moment, and unbeknownst to Roz,
5860040	5862040	she has an exciting career opportunity ahead of her,
5862040	5865040	and Frasier is preparing to say goodbye to Charlotte.
5865040	5867040	The episode opens with Frasier on a plane,
5867040	5870040	recounting the strange turn of events that got him aboard that flight,
5870040	5875040	and it began with Frasier's agent, Bebe, letting Frasier know he has an exciting new job offer.
5893040	5899040	As Frasier weighs his options, he has to say goodbye to Charlotte as she leaves for Chicago.
5899040	5904040	At Martin and Ronnie's wedding, disaster hits when Eddie, the ring bearer, eats the wedding ring.
5911040	5914040	Daphne and Niles take Eddie to the vet, and then her water breaks.
5922040	5929040	And just like that, she has a brand new baby boy.
5929040	5933040	He's named David, which is possibly a tribute to series co-creator David Angel,
5933040	5936040	who had passed away with his wife a few years prior.
5936040	5939040	Martin and Ronnie arrive and get married at the vet's office.
5939040	5941040	And for good measure, it's also Eddie's birthday.
5941040	5944040	It only loosely enters into the plot, but I felt like it needed to be mentioned.
5944040	5947040	After the wedding, Martin and Ronnie plan on moving in together,
5947040	5951040	and with Daphne already moved in with Niles, it leaves Frasier finally alone in his apartment.
5951040	5957040	As he poses for a meme, we see the end of an era as Martin's chair is moved out of the apartment.
5970040	5974040	In a cute nod to the first episode, the same actor who moved in Martin's chair is also the one who takes it away.
5974040	5978040	With Martin moved out, and Daphne and Niles now busy with their new son,
5978040	5981040	a lonely Frasier decides to take that job in San Francisco.
5988040	5992040	Roz is also moving on as she's promoted to station manner at KACL.
6003040	6006040	Everyone gathers in Frasier's apartment to say goodbye before he moves to San Francisco.
6008040	6026040	Martin's goodbye is particularly sweet, hearkening back to the first episode as he finally thanks Frasier.
6039040	6041040	And Niles, simply as Niles?
6050040	6058040	The episode is capped off with Frasier reading Tennyson's poem Ulysses and braving one more change in his life, which brings us back to that flight.
6068040	6076040	Frasier taking a chance on love is a nice way to bookend the series.
6076040	6082040	What is life without taking those chances, making those gestures, striving for something to live for?
6082040	6087040	Frasier's life has consistently been one about the barriers that prevent him from connecting to others.
6087040	6091040	Some a product of his class, others of his own making.
6091040	6095040	It's a great irony that runs through a series about a man who makes his living helping others.
6095040	6103040	His abysmal dating record is perhaps the greatest symbol of his lack of ability to connect to anything, with bad luck explaining some of his troubles and circumstance affecting the rest.
6103040	6111040	Frasier deciding to take one more leap in his life and heading towards the great unknown of Chicago to be with Charlotte is him finally jumping over one of those barriers.
6111040	6114040	Finally closing one of those distances.
6114040	6119040	And he's also turning down a great job offer as part of it, effectively sacrificing fame and fortune for a chance at love.
6119040	6129040	If Frasier began this series as a silly rich man to absorb with vanity to find real happiness in his life, the finale is him choosing not to venture deeper into that world so he might find something more meaningful.
6129040	6133040	When asked his thoughts on what fate awaited Frasier, Kelsey Grammer said,
6133040	6137040	I sometimes think Frasier went to Chicago and Charlotte told him to get the hell out.
6137040	6138040	That seems to be his luck.
6138040	6140040	Maybe they ended up with a wonderful life together.
6140040	6143040	And maybe we'll find out someday.
6143040	6146040	Goodnight Seattle, we love you!
6146040	6153040	Kelsey Grammer had been mentioning the possibility of a reboot as far back as 2018, with plans originally being a third act for Frasier in a whole new setting.
6153040	6158040	The plan was, at first, to have it air in 2020, though that never materialized.
6158040	6166040	On February 24th, 2021, it was revealed that the series would be streaming exclusively on Paramount+, with hopes of it premiering sometimes in 2022.
6166040	6169040	So far, there's no concrete news of a date or even cast.
6169040	6173040	The only thing we know for certain is that Kelsey Grammer will once again be reprising the role of Frasier.
6173040	6182040	Several cast members of Frasier have been asked if they're participating, but so far no one has conferred much of anything, aside from them being aware that it will be happening.
6182040	6186040	The cultural impact and lasting legacy of Frasier extends well into the future.
6186040	6189040	It's a bit difficult to describe, so I got some help to explain that.
6189040	6193040	Hey, this is Hootz from the YouTube channel Little Hoot.
6193040	6200040	I'm creating a companion video to Jose's on Frasier that's a collaboration with Neil from The Liberal Cook.
6200040	6214040	In it, Neil and I attempt to suss out Frasier's legacy, and in doing so, we touch on a broad range of topics, including the misogyny of 90s comedy, philosopher Ahana Arendt, TV tropes, and Anita Hill.
6214040	6218040	It's kind of a wild one, and I hope you enjoy.
6218040	6221040	It's hard to overstate how well-received Frasier was.
6221040	6233040	In addition to being a hit with strong ratings throughout its run, Frasier also managed to win 37 Primetime Emmy Awards, the most ever for a completed TV series, until that record was broken by Game of Thrones in 2016.
6233040	6244040	Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce both won four Emmys for their respective portrayals of Frasier and Niles, and Frasier won Outstanding Comedy Series five years in a row, a feat only matched by Modern Family.
6244040	6249040	The series has also spawned a number of home releases, books, and other forms of merchandise over the years.
6249040	6257040	It's also been playing in heavy syndication as well, letting whole new generations of people discover Frasier, joking and describing how new viewers react to the show, saying,
6257040	6261040	I think new viewers like the show because, apart from its quality, it doesn't remind them of anything.
6261040	6267040	No one says, oh, yet another show about two relentlessly highbrow romantically thwarted psychiatrists.
6267040	6277040	Following the end of Frasier, Kelsey Grammer would go on to be involved in countless TV and film projects over the years, from appearing as beasts in the X-Men movies to being the executive producer of the TV series Girlfriends.
6277040	6285040	He is still likely best remembered for the 20 years he spent playing Frasier, though he spent even more time, 29 years in fact, playing sideshow Bob on The Simpsons.
6285040	6294040	And I would be remiss if I didn't also mention that The Simpsons had a number of Frasier references in those episodes, including guest appearances by David Hyde Pierce and John Mahoney.
6294040	6303040	David Hyde Pierce continued to have a number of TV and film roles, though he tended more towards working on stage, including winning a Tony for his role in the 2007 production of Curtains.
6303040	6310040	His performances on Frasier were typically noted for how keenly they reacted to the audience, so a career on stage makes perfect sense for Pierce.
6310040	6315040	John Mahoney appeared in several roles after Frasier, though Martin Crane would always be his signature performance.
6315040	6321040	Sadly, on February 4th, 2018, Mahoney passed away due to complications from throat cancer.
6321040	6324040	In an interview, Perry Gilpin told a sweet story about Mahoney.
6324040	6327040	A few years ago, John took me and my family to dinner in Chicago.
6327040	6332040	While we were driving back, my husband was texting with Chris Lloyd and read Chris's text out loud.
6332040	6337040	Please tell the great John Mahoney it was one of the honors of my life to work with him.
6337040	6339040	I could see a little tear for him in John's eye.
6339040	6342040	Then my daughter says, Who's John Mahoney?
6342040	6344040	John almost fell out of the car laughing.
6344040	6346040	He never took himself too seriously.
6347040	6354040	Jane Leves continued her career throughout the 2000s after the end of Frasier, eventually finding herself on Hot in Cleveland, which ran for six seasons.
6354040	6360040	She took some time off of television after that, though eventually returned to the drama series The Resident, which is currently in its fifth season.
6360040	6366040	Perry Gilpin has been working in film and TV since the end of Frasier and has also built a fairly extensive list of credits doing voiceover work.
6366040	6372040	She even has the unique distinction of being part of the ill-fated Final Fantasy The Spirits Within.
6372040	6378040	In addition to Frasier, Moose also appeared in the feature film My Dog Skip once again alongside his son Enzo.
6378040	6383040	Sadly, on June 22, 2006, Moose passed of natural causes at the age of 15.
6383040	6389040	Enzo would pass not long after on June 23, 2010, at the age of 14, due to cancer.
6389040	6392040	Both will be remembered as two of the very best boys.
6392040	6398040	Class looms heavily in Frasier, often as a barrier from preventing people from making genuine connections.
6398040	6407040	The very idea of people in the upper class is consistently a source of mockery, but more importantly, it's also demonstrated to be a driver of division and a barrier for loving compassion.
6407040	6414040	Frasier does a wonderful service by showing us that this excess doesn't make anyone better. It's a social structure that moves us away from one another.
6414040	6418040	Reflected on the show, David I. Pierce describes how it connects people, saying,
6429040	6432040	that I no longer think of it as a coincidence, but as part of the show's legacy.
6432040	6440040	Frasier was a show about connecting through unlikely circumstances, but the circumstances weren't the living arrangements, but the way their social spheres shaped them.
6440040	6444040	The idea that these barriers can be torn down makes it much easier to laugh together.
6444040	6448040	No matter how hard the times might get, that's what makes Frasier such an excellent show.
6448040	6456040	When I made that Cheers retrospective a while ago, I knew it had to be a two-parter, and I knew I would eventually have to speak about Frasier.
6456040	6466040	Growing up, I didn't really watch Cheers, but I definitely watched Frasier, so revisiting it all these years later was a treat and a reminder of why this show was such a joy to watch in my youth.
6466040	6471040	It held up surprisingly well, and I think that's a tribute to the writing and performances throughout it.
6471040	6477040	If you enjoyed this lengthy look back at the show Frasier, do consider becoming a patron or member for this channel.
6477040	6484040	You'll join all the lovely names you see scrolling up on the screen now, plus you'll get early access to videos in the future.
6484040	6490040	Patrons also get a little extra say on which series comes next, though I can't make any promises as to which you'll be covering.
6490040	6493040	Thank you all so much for watching!
