0	5040	We've all made mistakes in our lives, done things we look back on with regret,
5040	8000	maybe wishing there was some kind of way of making it right.
8000	12000	My Name is Earl takes an average scumbag and gives him a mission to do just that,
12000	15840	and in turn gives us a blueprint on how to make amends for wrongdoing
15840	17920	and making the world a better place in the process.
18800	22960	Running for a mere four seasons, My Name is Earl was a smash hit when it debuted,
22960	26240	only to be unceremoniously cancelled after its fourth season.
26240	29840	In that short time, it won several awards and grew a small cult following.
30240	34080	Earl Hickey and his journey of redemption through the cartoonish role of Camden County
34080	38240	gave audiences a crash course in karma, revealing the simplicity of doing good.
38240	41360	And it gave us one of the greatest mustaches in TV history.
41360	44400	The story of My Name is Earl begins with Greg Garcia.
44400	49200	Before creating the series, Garcia had written for shows such as Family Matters and On Our Own.
49200	52400	He then went on to co-create the sitcom Yes, Dear for CBS.
52400	56080	Garcia came up with an idea for a show starring a less than savory character
56080	58480	trying to make up for all the wrong he had done in his life,
58480	61520	partially inspired by parts of Garcia's own personal history.
62240	65680	My father, or stepfather, is named Earl.
66320	67760	He wasn't the best guy in the world.
68880	71440	He was somewhat of a crook.
71440	74400	I don't think he was as bad as some of the things Earl has done,
74400	78480	but he kind of saw the light and started to change his ways
78480	80800	and didn't officially make a list.
80800	85040	But he went around and kind of made up for some of the things he's done
85040	86720	and he's continuing to do that.
86720	88160	So he really inspired me.
88160	91760	Garcia pitched the show to Fox, thinking it would be a good fit for the network,
91760	94320	but they ultimately passed on the pilot's script.
94320	96160	That script found its way to NBC,
96160	99680	and while they initially wanted Garcia to create a whole new series for them,
99680	103680	he suggested that instead they take the existing script and turn it into a series.
103680	105600	And so My Name is Earl was born.
105600	108480	Early on, director Mark Buckland was attached to the project
108480	110880	and became a big part of the look of the series.
110880	114880	He and Garcia were on the same page about wanting My Name is Earl to look cinematic.
114880	118080	We just said, you know, this thing really should look like a movie every week.
118080	120640	For the show to move forward, it had to assemble the right cast
120640	124000	and the crucial first step was finding the right person to play Earl.
124000	126960	Partially because NBC really wanted him on their network,
126960	129440	Jason Lee was an early favorite to play Earl.
129440	133120	Lee had mostly worked in movies at this point and back in 2005,
133120	137040	it was a lot less common to see actors moving from the big screen to the small one.
137040	140000	The strength of the pilot's script convinced Lee to take the part.
140000	143920	This is something that I would see in a film if done right.
144720	147200	And if done right, it would be up my alley,
147200	149920	the kind of movie I would want to be and I would want to watch.
149920	154320	Earl was a former dirtbag turned good guy and Lee brought an easy charm to the character
154320	156560	that made the audience root for him on his journey.
156560	160400	Lee also had the brilliant idea of giving Earl his signature mustache.
160400	164160	And he said, you know what, he goes, I look really funny with a mustache.
164720	167760	He goes, trust me, a mustache would be hilarious.
168480	169760	And he was right.
169760	172880	The iconic look was originally something they had to fight the network on,
172880	177920	but for all our sake, sanity eventually prevailed and Earl Hickey was born.
177920	179520	You got great boobs, Peggy.
180560	182240	Her name was not Peggy.
182240	186480	Ethan Suppley was in early consideration for the role of Randy Hickey, Earl's brother.
186480	188640	Although Lee and Suppley had been friends for a while,
188640	190880	having worked on a number of projects over the years,
190880	193840	that wasn't how Suppley ended up in consideration for the role.
193840	196480	And the story and the characters were hysterical.
196480	199280	My wife is a manager and she said, what the hell are you reading?
199280	201360	And I said, I'm reading My Name is Earl.
201360	203440	And she said, that's Jason Shell.
203440	204480	And I was like, what?
204480	207600	It was a complete surprise to Suppley when he found out that he was in the running for
207600	212160	a series starring his longtime friend and their onscreen chemistry made for an easy fit.
212160	216240	Randy is a man of many strange talents and a unique perspective.
216240	218960	Although not the most intellectually gifted of people,
218960	222400	he does have a good heart and remains Earl's most loyal friend.
222400	225280	Randy, those are poison.
228560	229280	How poison?
229920	234080	The role of Joy, Earl's ex-wife, very quickly went to Jamie Pressley.
234080	237280	According to Pressley, it was basically given to her at the audition.
237280	240480	I went in there like, so when do we start shooting?
241360	247360	It's hard to imagine anyone else as the hard as nails, yet somehow charming trailer park terror.
247360	249440	Although Joy and Earl didn't have the best marriage,
249440	252000	they did manage to become friends after it ended.
252000	253840	At least, they did eventually.
253840	256400	You are not the one standing with the freshly broken bottle now, are you?
259280	262960	Well, this will still hurt if I hit you with it.
262960	267440	Eddie Steeples caught the eye of Greg Garcia after his appearance in a number of commercials,
267440	272480	specifically his role as the rubber band man in a series of Office Max ad spots.
272480	276720	Steeples played Darnell Turner, also known as Harry Monroe, more on that later,
276720	279040	and affectionately nicknamed Crabman.
279040	282160	Darnell is Joy's love interest and eventual new husband.
282160	287120	The perpetual face of chill, Darnell is the yin to her yang, though his calm demeanor
287120	288800	hides a mysterious past.
288800	289520	Hi, Earl.
289520	290480	Hey, Crabman.
291280	293200	Joy wanted me to bring you these poison cookies.
293760	294240	Huh?
294240	297280	I wasn't gonna get involved, but now she got me delivering poison.
297280	298640	Just don't sing right.
298640	304160	The last person to join the principal cast was Nadine Velasquez, playing Catalina Arruca,
304160	306800	the maid in the motel Earl and Randy live in.
306800	309840	Velasquez actually gave up being part of the series Prison Break,
309840	313040	where she would have played the character Maricruz Delgado,
313040	315680	so she could instead be a part of My Name is Earl.
315680	319680	Catalina brings a bit of flavor to the cast, offering a friend to support Earl and Randy,
319680	321600	while also being a foil to Joy.
321600	322160	There you go.
322800	324960	Now, if you do it to the other hand, I want to take you to my church
324960	326480	so I can watch all the old ladies cry.
327120	330000	When the show came together, it tested surprisingly well with audiences,
330000	333520	in spite of the fact that its single-camera style was a relatively new thing
333520	334960	for networks that come at the time.
335600	339920	Those early positive signs even led NBC to give out advanced previews of the pilot
339920	343440	to people via a CD-ROM that was inserted into magazines,
343440	347680	something that is absolutely a relic of the era this show came from.
347680	350400	My Name is Earl premiered on a Tuesday night and brought with it
350400	353920	some high hopes that it would be a hit, and it was an instant success.
354640	358080	Straight from Carson Daly's lips to my morphine-laced ear.
358080	363280	Debuting on Tuesday, September 20th, 2005, with an episode titled
363280	366320	Pilot, My Name is Earl waved hello to the world.
366320	369600	The opening minutes of the show establish the premise in short order.
369600	371600	Earl is not a good guy.
371600	374320	Sort of shifty-looking fella who buys a pack of smokes,
374320	377280	a couple lotto scratchers, and a tall boy at 10 in the morning.
377280	380080	He's married to a woman who got him drunk enough to marry her,
380080	383200	even though she was six months pregnant with another man's child.
383200	386080	Joy didn't remember much about the boy's real father,
386080	387440	except that he drove a Ford.
388080	389760	So we named him Dodge.
389760	391920	A year later, she gave birth to another son,
391920	394720	though Earl suspects this one wasn't his either.
394720	395440	There he was.
396880	398000	Earl Jr.
398080	402160	Earl's life changes forever, though, when he wins $100,000 in the lotto,
402160	404880	and he's then hit by a car and loses the scratcher.
412080	415680	Joy soon leaves Earl for Darnell, the real father of her second son,
415680	419840	and while Earl is stuck in a hospital bed wondering why his life is so miserable,
419840	422720	Earl learns about a little thing called karma.
422720	424880	You do good things, and good things happen to you.
424880	426960	You do bad things, and they'll come back to haunt you.
427520	428480	Karma.
428480	428960	Karma.
429520	430720	There it was.
430720	434800	Having been tricked out of the trailer by Joy, Earl and Randy are living at a motel.
434800	438400	They make a new friend in Catalina, and Earl announces his new plan in life,
438400	442560	to make a list of every person he's wronged and then try to somehow make it up to them.
442560	445440	I almost died because something good happened to me that I didn't deserve.
446160	449760	That karma stuff is gonna kill me unless I make up for everything on that list.
449760	454000	As if karma is smiling down on him, the lottery scratcher returns,
454000	459520	and Earl has $100,000 he can use to fund his new quest to make all his wrongs right.
459520	462320	The rest of the episode has Earl going on his first task,
462320	466880	making amends with one of his former bullying victims, Kenny, played by Greg Binkley.
466880	471360	He decides for this one he needs to get Kenny laid, only Kenny has a secret.
471360	474800	I live in a small town, and I've never been face to face with a gay before.
474800	483040	This is where the show starts to get more interesting.
483040	486640	If all Earl was doing in this series was traveling around doing good deeds,
486640	488240	it wouldn't be much of a show.
488240	492640	From the pilot, we're getting a few key elements about what makes this series so special.
492640	497760	Earl isn't just here to help Kenny, he has to help himself by getting past his own homophobia.
504800	507680	To help get Kenny out of the closet, Earl takes him to a gay bar,
507680	512960	and the experience is so transformative for Kenny that he lets Earl know he can cross him off his list.
512960	517840	The one man I was the most scared of in my whole life has accepted me as I am.
517840	522000	You took away my confidence, but today you gave it back.
522000	525680	This episode offered a very lovely portrait of how to make amends to a person.
525680	528480	It begins with Earl realizing he's done something wrong.
528480	530240	He then goes to make amends.
530240	532320	He learns about who his victim is as a person,
532320	535520	and what unique way he can offer some form of restitution.
535520	538080	And then his victim tells Earl when he's done enough.
538080	542080	It's a form of justice that focuses on restitution towards the wrong party
542080	543920	rather than punishing the aggressor.
543920	546880	And there were so many other important facts established in the pilot.
546880	550560	Earl finding the lottery ticket he lost, and still sticking with his list,
550560	553920	establishes that this mission is something Earl is going to be on for a while.
553920	557600	He's not just doing it for the sake of getting that one lottery ticket back.
557600	561280	And by helping someone else, Earl also helps make himself a better person,
561280	563600	overcoming the homophobia of his past self.
563600	567360	Something we'll see in later episodes is Kenny coming to Earl's help when he needs it in the
567360	571440	future as the series reveals over time, while Earl views it as a personal mission,
571440	574560	this journey has consequences for all of Camden.
574560	577840	Earl is a flawed guide, but he's made lovable by wanting to do better.
577840	581440	He's also limited in that he's not suddenly a master of ethical living.
581440	584480	But this doesn't somehow stop him from being a decent person.
584480	588000	Karma is a simple, but very effective way of living a better life.
588000	590400	Something anyone can take on, even Earl.
590400	594240	The pilot was a huge hit, being watched by nearly 15 million people.
594240	597840	A fun fact about this episode is that it also includes an appearance by the series creator,
597840	598800	Greg Garcia.
598800	601200	He's the guy Randy dances with at the gay bar.
601200	604880	Over the years, there would be a number of cameos like this from Garcia and other members
604880	606240	of the staff on the show.
606240	608240	But this one was particularly fun.
608240	612160	In the DVD set for the first season, there was also an alternate version of the pilot,
612160	613840	Bad Karma, that was included.
613840	618640	Instead of Carson Daly, Earl listens to Stewie Griffin from Family Guy go on a short rant,
618640	620080	and takes this to heart instead.
620400	624560	So instead of making a list of people he's wronged, Earl makes a list of vengeance and
624560	645600	decides to be even worse than he had been before.
645600	650200	Much of the pilot's events are inverted, like Earl attacking Joy and Darnell instead
650200	653160	of Joy attacking him when she finds out he won the lottery.
653160	657160	And Earl tries to manipulate Kenny, thinking that he's straight, into having sex with
657160	659320	a prostitute who has a penis.
659320	663800	The episode ends with Earl being hit by a car, and this time, a very upset Joy and Darnell,
663800	668140	left bald by Earl's attack, decide to finish him off for good, leaving Randy to become
668140	672280	the star of the series.
672280	676320	This episode is a cute little extra, and it's also notable for being the one time we see
676320	679760	Jason Lee playing Earl with a fake mustache and sideburns.
679760	684840	Absolutely criminal.
684840	689280	Earl's growth can be summarized very easily as a simple man making himself and his community
689280	691000	better through good deeds.
691000	693320	In the second episode, quit smoking.
693320	696240	Earl tries to make up for getting his friend Donnie arrested.
696240	699040	Only Donnie found religion in jail, and he forgives Earl.
699040	702880	But Donnie wasn't the only victim, and Earl finds that he needs to make up for the two
702880	705440	years Donnie's mother lost with her son.
705440	708960	So to make things square, he helps Donnie's mother quit smoking so she'll have some
708960	718720	extra time with him.
718720	723360	While smoking is likely not as easy to quit as the montage makes it to be, or at least
723360	728080	give quitting a fighting chance like the montage suggests, this little story reflects how Earl
728080	731480	realizes his actions have hurt people outside of his list.
731480	735520	The bad Earl did often spilled out and had a greater impact than he thought, but the
735520	737160	same is true of the good.
737160	740800	This list item helped Earl get healthier and Donnie and his mother have more time to
740800	741920	spend together.
741920	743880	Three people helped with one good deed.
743880	747880	The important lesson, and one we see throughout the series, is that everyone and everything
747880	752360	is connected to something else, and one good deed or one bad deed could ripple out to affect
752360	753840	an entire community.
753840	758320	By choosing to do good instead of bad, this is how Earl is making his community a better
758320	759320	place.
759320	762760	There's also a wonderful feedback loop that shows us that, by doing good and becoming
762760	767480	a better person, Earl is able to take on more challenging tasks and having an increased
767480	769400	impact in his community.
769400	773480	Earl is effectively becoming a greater force for change as the series progresses, and Earl's
773480	776940	commitment to karma is tested through an increasingly heavy load.
776940	778940	This is how Earl makes himself better.
778940	783080	In the season one finale, number one, Earl attempts to cross off the first thing on his
783080	784080	list.
784080	788080	It was the last bad thing he ever did before getting hit by a car, still ten dollars from
788080	791920	a guy at a convenience store, only he finds out that that guy was going to use ten dollars
791920	795680	to buy the winning lottery ticket that Earl bought instead, so Earl has to give the guy
795680	797320	his lottery money.
797320	801720	Having lost his lottery winnings, Earl puts his faith in karma to care for him and Randy,
801720	812680	and that often takes the shape of his friends helping him out.
812680	816080	Even with his money gone, Earl keeps working on the list.
816080	820680	Then he loses his car, and he keeps working on the list, and it even looks like he might
820680	825040	be losing Randy, and he still keeps on working on the list.
825040	829400	He learns that the man Earl originally stole that ten dollars from was ruined by the lottery
829400	836240	winnings.
836240	841440	There's an almost mystical quality to the experience, as if this money can only be used
841440	843040	to do good for others.
843040	847520	This episode also raised the important point of how sometimes doing good can feel like
847520	852400	you're going backwards, but if you stay on track, things will work out, and friends
852400	854000	can help you along the way.
854000	867600	The audio commentary reflected this very important part of the series.
867600	870880	Earl at the beginning of the season likely would have bailed the moment his money vanished
870880	875560	and gone back to his thieving ways, but doing good deeds for a year has changed him.
875560	879120	It's not just about the reward, but also the experience.
879120	882760	He still believes karma will make his life better, but not in the way he might have at
882760	883760	the beginning.
883760	887800	Earl's capacity to do good and the power of good deeds are a major force driving him
887800	889560	forward throughout the seasons.
889560	893320	What Earl can do for others expands as more people do good alongside him.
893320	896440	Earl's approach to doing good deeds is never very complicated.
896440	900360	He's aware that he's a work in progress and that by doing good, he's working on
900360	905080	making himself better, as perhaps best summed up at the end of the season one episode titled
905080	916640	The Professor.
916640	918480	How can you not root for this guy?
918480	921920	These little moments are never very complicated and that's part of Earl's charm.
921920	925680	He's a simple guy and doing good doesn't have to be a complicated thing.
925680	930600	In the season two episode, Rob to Stoner Blind, Earl is faced with a deep dilemma when Woody,
930600	944960	played by Christian Slater, teaches him about climate change.
944960	948800	As Earl realizes this is going to require him to do a lot more than change his personal
948800	961480	habits, he starts to feel overwhelmed by the problem.
961480	967080	Climate change is beyond the power of a former thief on a mission to underdo his wrongdoings.
967080	971000	The episode saying Earl just needs to repay the earth in a small way is a decent enough
971000	972000	message.
972000	976960	But what rings particularly true here is that, for Earl, thinking on some kind of grand scale
976960	980480	to fix the planet is not something he needs to do.
980480	984320	What we're learning here is that, instead of being bogged down in grand ethical debates
984320	989160	on how we live our lives and how it impacts every other organism on the planet, Earl can
989160	994360	do good just by following his list and by doing that, it reveals how doing good is really
994360	995760	a simple thing.
995760	998140	That's another theme that runs through the series.
998140	1003040	It's not that worrying about big problems is a bad thing, it's that doing good doesn't
1003040	1006280	require exclusively fixating on those heavier burdens.
1006280	1010800	As long as someone is still making some kind of small step to help with those bigger problems
1010800	1014560	and spending the rest of their time doing good in other, more immediate ways.
1014560	1019320	The series isn't about wrestling with massive ethical conundrums.
1019320	1023880	For instance, is it more moral to adopt a stray cat or donate your time to help a soup
1023880	1024880	kitchen?
1024880	1028820	The answer in this series is that it's not an either or question.
1028820	1031160	You do the one that makes the most sense to you.
1031160	1034000	It's the doing that matters the most.
1034000	1037880	In the season 4 episode Sweet Johnny, we see a great example of that when Earl tries
1037880	1042880	to make amends with a local stuntman named Sweet Johnny, played by David Arquette, only
1042880	1047460	to learn that Sweet Johnny has a brain injury that prevents him from forming new memories.
1047460	1051540	So Earl could never really make up for the fact that he slept with Sweet Johnny's girlfriend.
1051540	1055800	Though he keeps trying, eventually Earl realizes why he's trying so hard.
1055800	1059600	I was really only trying to make me feel better by crossing Johnny off the list.
1059600	1063380	For the first time since I started doing my list, I wasn't going to be able to cross
1063380	1064380	somebody off.
1064380	1067260	I was going to have to just let it nag at me.
1067260	1071340	But since Johnny was never going to remember, it felt right that someone will never forget.
1071340	1076020	A guilty conscience is not something that is always a thing you can get rid of, but
1076020	1078700	good deeds are always something a person can do.
1078700	1082820	It may not make things right, but it can serve as a permanent reminder to be a better person.
1082820	1086540	It's a very deep lesson for such a simple guy, and it's how the whole process of doing
1086540	1088820	good shows the evolution of Earl.
1088820	1092740	He becomes a better person and learns about the limitations of those good works, and even
1092740	1097420	though he can't make everything right, that's no excuse not to do the good he can.
1097420	1101220	And importantly, with Earl learning these lessons, it reveals that anyone can learn
1101220	1102540	them alongside him.
1102540	1107380	Although Earl is trying to be a better person, what's inescapable is that he isn't quite
1107380	1111140	there yet, and that often gets revealed in some less than enlightened moments throughout
1111140	1112180	the series.
1112180	1116020	The aforementioned homophobia from the pilot is a great example because it not only highlights
1116020	1119060	a problem of Earl's, but also how he corrects it.
1119060	1123620	It was put succinctly by Jamie Pressley in the audio commentary for the season one episode,
1123620	1124620	White Lie Christmas.
1124620	1127500	That's what I love about our show though, is that it's politically incorrect and then
1127500	1128500	it corrects itself.
1128500	1131060	In a really twisted way.
1131060	1132860	In a really twisted way.
1132860	1136540	Even though the show's humor bordered on the offensive at times, it didn't get a lot
1136540	1138580	of pushback from the audience.
1138580	1142180	In another audio commentary, this time in the season one episode, Oh Karma Where Art
1142180	1145980	Thou, we hear how that that's why the show didn't get as much anger directed towards
1145980	1148500	it for its more offensive moments.
1148500	1168340	The show on occasion also has its cake and eats it too by having Earl do all sorts of
1168340	1173460	horrible things in extended flashback sequences, sometimes nearly lasting the whole episode,
1173460	1175980	to then see him making up for it in the present.
1175980	1178620	This makes the whole journey feel more real.
1178620	1182540	Rather than everything take place within the narrow timeframe of a few days, like on most
1182540	1187620	other sitcoms, going back several years with numerous flashbacks creates a more realistic
1187620	1192340	length of time for Earl to grow and the audience has been seeing that the whole time, since
1192340	1196820	that's the premise of the series, so they can be a bit more forgiving of Earl in the
1196820	1197820	past.
1197820	1201660	Or even people in the present who have yet to have undergone Earl's positive influence
1201660	1203260	or gone on his journey.
1203260	1207020	The passage of time needed to improve as a person feels particularly real when it comes
1207020	1212140	to how Earl begins to mend his relationship with his father, Carl, played by Bo Bridges.
1212140	1215940	When we first see them together, shortly after Earl has started his list in the episode,
1215940	1221820	Cost Dad the Election, we can see what a lifetime of Earl's bad behavior has done to the relationship.
1221820	1231780	Earl is trying to convince his dad to run for mayor after Earl ruined his last campaign.
1231780	1235960	Earl drags Carl back into another mayoral election, and while it looks like Carl might
1235960	1240040	win this one, Earl accidentally screws it up again when he gets arrested for falling
1240040	1241040	on a cop.
1241040	1252220	But the real tragedy is that, Carl just can't believe Earl is trying to do better.
1252220	1270160	But that's not the whole story.
1270160	1274840	A few episodes later, in Dad's Car, we see Earl's efforts start to pay off when his
1274840	1280220	attempt to return Carl's lost Mustang reveals that the car was meant for Earl, which has
1280220	1282640	Earl putting himself on his own list.
1282640	1300240	Earl doesn't just get the car, but the project of he and his dad putting it back together.
1300240	1304280	Perhaps the sweetest part of the relationship is in the season 4 episode, Monkeys Take a
1304280	1310160	Bath, where Carl finds out that his wife, Kay, played by Nancy Lenahan, cheated on him.
1310160	1314680	After learning that payback isn't going to take the pain away, Carl and Earl bond
1314680	1336800	over having been married to women who were unfaithful.
1336800	1340820	Admittedly, this is pretty funny, it's also really beautiful.
1340820	1344920	What Earl and Carl give each other in this exchange is freedom from the chains of a masculine
1344920	1349220	repression of emotions, and they both learn the power of forgiveness.
1349220	1353660	If this series is about Earl seeking forgiveness from others, this episode, and this final
1353660	1357340	part of his journey with his father, reveal that he also needed to find a way to forgive
1357340	1361500	others himself, because sometimes, even Earl is the victim.
1361500	1366280	In this case, the victim of a society that told him he wasn't allowed to cry.
1366280	1376640	And anyone raised as a boy can certainly relate to that.
1376640	1386040	Kay Hickey describes her sons like this.
1386040	1390080	I would rather say that Randy is… not complex.
1390080	1394640	But that doesn't make him any less worthy of the respect and admiration one has for
1394640	1395640	Earl.
1395640	1399240	One of the first things we learn about Randy is how much he cares about his brother.
1399240	1402680	And it's not so much that he needs Earl to babysit him all the time, but that Randy
1402680	1404400	chooses to be with his brother.
1404400	1407440	This makes Randy the perfect karma partner for Earl.
1407440	1424640	Earl sums it up well in the season 1 episode, Monkeys in Space, when he says…
1424640	1428680	Earl's appreciation of Randy, not just as a helper, but as a brother, is evident
1428680	1429680	throughout the series.
1429680	1433680	You get a real sense that they were always close, but if anything, working on the list
1433680	1437920	has brought them even closer together, particularly when Randy goes the extra mile to help Earl
1437920	1441560	with his list, even if it means putting his own wants on hold.
1441560	1456160	This is from the season 1 episode, Still Beer from a Golfer.
1456160	1457960	Earl and Randy have a very sweet relationship.
1457960	1462120	They're perhaps not typical brothers in that they sleep in the same bed and spend
1462120	1465640	every day together, but they support each other in everything they do.
1465640	1470120	Randy's ability to do good reinforces the point made about doing good being a relatively
1470120	1471760	simple proposition.
1471760	1473840	If Earl can do it, why not Randy?
1473840	1478100	His whole character serves as an extreme example of one of the points I mentioned about Earl,
1478100	1482040	that doing good does not require some sophisticated set of ethics.
1482040	1486320	In season 4's Got the Babysitter Pregnant, we get a sense of how far Randy has come when
1486320	1503040	he fends for himself while helping someone on Earl's list.
1503040	1506680	With Randy having someone to look up to him the way he looked up to Earl, Randy starts
1506680	1510780	living by Earl's positive example, taking care of the guy and trying to get his life
1510780	1511780	in order.
1511780	1515400	And Randy reveals just how much his adventures with Earl have changed him for the better.
1515400	1530280	Although Earl does take care of Randy to a degree, it's important that this is a
1530280	1540240	voluntary relationship and Randy does his job as well, taking care of Earl.
1540240	1545240	Going back to the label of slow, we do need to address how Randy is often depicted on
1545240	1548700	the show as being less bright than most of the people around him.
1548700	1553260	In the season 2 episode, Harassed a Reporter, we see how some people view Randy when a news
1553260	1557860	story covering Earl's list tries to tug on the heartstrings of the audience by putting
1557860	1570220	Randy in a certain light.
1570220	1574300	When Randy confronts the reporter about how she deceptively edited the footage, she says
1574300	1580080	it was revenge for all the times he ruined her live broadcasts in the past.
1580080	1593480	Randy, who had been feeling overlooked compared to his do-gooder brother, takes the reporter's
1593480	1607460	words rather well.
1607460	1611060	Randy may not be a genius, but his ability to look on the bright side here reveals a
1611060	1615100	good heart and a mindset that doesn't let him get too trapped in self-pity.
1615100	1619340	But more important is that his fear of being labeled special reveals how labels like that
1619340	1620600	trap people.
1620600	1624820	It would turn Randy into an object of pity and mockery, and he's so much more than
1624820	1627000	what his grades and score are like.
1627000	1630980	In other shows, characters like Randy don't get nearly as much screen time unless they're
1630980	1633480	there to be mocked with brief one-liners.
1633480	1637480	And more than being a big part of the show, Randy has a really fulfilling life.
1637480	1642520	He falls in love multiple times, he goes on adventures, and when Earl is incapacitated,
1642520	1646000	he steps up for his brother and takes the list on himself.
1646000	1650040	Randy gets to be a part of the show just the way everyone else is, and more so than just
1650040	1653080	about every other character aside from Earl.
1653080	1657520	Randy is definitely not common, but we don't need to label him with a condition in need
1657520	1658720	of treatment.
1658720	1663920	Being different is not always a medical condition, and Randy is still a valuable and important
1663920	1666480	part of Camden County.
1666480	1670920	Another big part of Randy's story, at least in the first two seasons, is his crush on
1670920	1671920	Catalina.
1671920	1677380	Randy's fixation here is a bit creepy at times, and a bit strange considering we see
1677380	1681340	him date another woman within the time period he has a crush on Catalina.
1681340	1685780	Even after Randy marries Catalina to deal with her citizenship issues, he still can't
1685780	1691500	bring himself to be honest with her, and when he does, she only pretends to return his feelings.
1691500	1694820	Catalina then takes Joy's advice to make herself as gross as possible so they can ask
1694820	1697340	Saks and she can turn Randy off forever.
1697340	1701860	And it works, Randy is grossed out, but Catalina suddenly regrets it because Randy is apparently
1701860	1706940	great at Saks and their roles are reversed, with Catalina longing for Randy and him being
1706940	1709120	oblivious and uninterested.
1709120	1712700	And then the show just kinda drops that whole story and never really brings it up again.
1712700	1716600	The whole misadventure would feel strange not to mention, but perhaps it serves as an example
1716600	1720580	of why certain plotlines are introduced and then dropped in the series.
1720580	1724580	Personally, I suspect Randy's strength as a character is part of the reason this plotline
1724580	1725580	got scrapped.
1725580	1729580	He was so versatile and capable of so much that he didn't need a running premise to
1729580	1734260	fuel story ideas, he got to generate them all on his own by being himself.
1734260	1739300	He never really needed the crush on Catalina to make him interesting, he was always interesting.
1739300	1748220	Ethan Subley touched on this briefly in a panel discussion.
1748220	1752740	Randy is always the same because the best parts of him don't really need to change.
1752740	1757140	Sure he grows and changes because of Earl's positive influence, but deep down he was always
1757140	1761540	a sweet guy with a good heart and his unique perspective of the world let him see things
1761540	1766100	that other people didn't, and sometimes that's all you need to tell good stories.
1766100	1770780	As one example of a fun Randy-centered story, in season 4's We've Got Spirit, we find
1770780	1779440	out that Randy has always dreamed of being a cheerleader.
1779440	1783260	We see Randy take the lead, inspiring the other cheerleaders at the camp, and when it's
1783260	1787140	finally time to perform, he goes out there and shows everyone what he's got, even if
1787140	1795940	everyone in Camden only showed up to have a laugh.
1795940	1802460	And this time, it's Earl who steps up to support Randy.
1802460	1804860	The Camden Squad wins everyone over.
1804860	1809380	A nice touch in this episode is that, even though Randy is doing his own thing, it doesn't
1809380	1811740	mean he doesn't need Earl to support him.
1811740	1815380	If Randy is always backing up Earl, Earl can also do the same for Randy.
1815380	1819580	I personally don't have a brother, but I know if I did, I'd want a relationship
1819580	1829700	to be like Randy's and Earl's.
1829700	1832860	Joy Turner is not an easy woman to love.
1832860	1836300	She's rude, mean, and self-absorbed.
1836300	1839340	In the early episodes of the series, it's almost as though she's being set up to be
1839340	1843940	the villain, trying to kill Earl so she can get his lottery winnings, but the series quickly
1843940	1848820	readjusted and took some time to portray Joy in a more sympathetic light, at least
1848820	1849820	a little bit.
1849820	1853940	Jamie Pressley's portrayal of Joy was a major standout early in the show's run.
1853940	1857740	Pressley was the only member of the principal cast nominated for an Emmy for her performance
1857740	1868940	on the series, and she won Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2007.
1868940	1872740	It was well-earned, and you can see Joy's role in the series expanding as they realized
1872740	1874740	how good Pressley was playing her.
1902740	1910340	In an interview, Pressley described the appeal of Joy as being an inner voice women wished
1910340	1911340	they could channel.
1911340	1916340	Believe it or not, I have women come up to me all the time saying, repeating all the
1916340	1923340	one-liners that Joy has, because there's a little bit of Joy in every woman that wants
1923340	1924820	to come out sometimes.
1924820	1929740	But what made the character work, and seems so particularly convincing, was her gradually
1929740	1931820	revealed range as a character.
1931820	1936220	When Joy and Darnell get married in Season 1's Joy's Wedding, it becomes a list item
1936220	1944180	for Earl when he drunkenly ruins it.
1944180	1948300	Things don't get too much better when, while planning Joy's dream wedding, Earl sleeps
1948300	1949300	with Joy.
1949300	1953020	Darnell is crushed when he finds out, and the wedding only goes forward when he realizes
1953020	1969500	the full depth of Joy's feelings.
1969500	1974140	Earl is very much an early work in progress, particularly in these early episodes, and
1974140	1977660	Joy represents something similar throughout the run of the series.
1977660	1982980	Although Earl is an imperfect convert to Karma, Joy is less impressed with the idea of Karma.
1983340	1988500	But as the series progresses, we, very slowly, see Joy begin to change.
1988500	1991380	It starts with her and Earl developing a real friendship.
1991380	1995620	In Season 1's The Bounty Hunter, we see Joy realizing just how far Earl is willing
1995620	1999760	to go to help her, keeping Joy safe from a bounty hunter, and the two put their marriage
1999760	2008840	in perspective.
2008840	2013960	In Season 2's Blow, Joy, finding out she has a half-sister, Liberty Washington, played
2013960	2028720	by Tamala Jones, ends up with Joy becoming a surrogate for her.
2028720	2033260	And by Season 4, Joy begins to check her own harsh behavior when she sees how it impacts
2033260	2035780	her kids in the episode, Joy and a Bubble.
2064200	2067840	What makes for a compelling character is someone who changes throughout the story, whether
2067840	2072680	they reveal parts of themselves not immediately evident, such as Joy's less abrasive side
2072680	2077200	coming out, or if a character grows, such as Joy becoming more empathetic to the people
2077200	2078280	around her.
2078280	2082440	In the context of My Name is Earl, it speaks to the transformative power of doing good
2082440	2087140	deeds that both of these things become more apparent as Joy is impacted by the good works
2087140	2089400	of Earl, and even does a couple herself.
2089400	2093120	Joy's life goes through some turbulent changes throughout the series.
2093120	2096560	She nearly goes to prison in one season and ends up in the Witness Protection Program
2096560	2101460	in another, but the real changes we care about are the ones inside her, the slow glacial
2101460	2106860	changes that reveal that even this incredibly unlikable woman has the capacity to be better.
2106860	2112020	Late in Season 4, Earl works to get Joy a spot on the TV game show Estrada or Nada,
2112020	2114460	in the two-parter Darnell outed.
2114460	2117980	Throughout the episode, we learn about how Joy dreams of being a celebrity, and she thinks
2117980	2121220	appearing on this game show is her last chance at that dream.
2121220	2134600	Her talents, though, are limited.
2134600	2139840	When appearing on TV leads Darnell's assumed identity to be compromised, more on that later,
2139840	2141560	they have to go into hiding.
2141560	2152580	But Crabman risks it all to let Joy live her dream.
2152580	2158460	And we see Joy show up that smug Eric Estrada.
2158460	2166920	Of course, none of that would have been possible without a few key assists from Earl, and we
2166920	2183160	get an idea of how far the relationship has come.
2183160	2186680	Joy and Darnell go into hiding for a few episodes, but when Joy is living the rich lifestyle
2186680	2191480	she thought she wanted, it reinforces that she was already happy with what she had.
2191480	2195680	They do return to their status quo of living in the trailer park in Camden, but even before
2195680	2199960	all that silliness, we see in this two-parter just how much Joy has in her life.
2199960	2203920	She has a husband who loves her, two kids who depend on her, and great friends like
2203920	2208580	Randy and Earl, and her harsh exterior is made less bitter with that knowledge.
2208580	2212040	And while she's still hard as nails, she can find the space to be happy and appreciate
2212040	2213240	the life she has.
2213240	2215680	Life doesn't need to dramatically change for her.
2215680	2218680	All she needs is a willingness to see what she already has around her.
2218680	2222360	That's part of the lesson Joy learns, and it's made possible because the people around
2222360	2225920	her stopped doing bad things and started doing good things.
2225920	2229440	Good works don't need to give someone a mansion, it just needs to give them a new
2229440	2236880	way of looking at their life.
2236880	2240400	My Name is Earl had a number of really strange episodes.
2240400	2244520	There are brief scenes with live-action puppets of the cast, there are multiple episodes where
2244520	2248440	the people of Camden are in an episode of Cops, and there's one fun episode where
2248440	2252600	the opening credits get recut to feature different characters, but these are relatively
2252600	2254400	short and self-contained.
2254400	2259880	The most ambitious project of the show is undoubtedly its entire third season.
2259880	2264240	Set up in the Season 2 finale, The Trial, we see Joy, who had spent much of Season 2 worried
2264240	2267960	about going to prison after stealing a truck, finally go to trial.
2267960	2272040	The evidence is tipping against Joy, namely recordings of a terrified Earl calling the
2272040	2277280	cops on her from the time they were married, so Earl feeling responsible does something
2277280	2278280	drastic.
2278280	2295280	Earl sees this as a form of karma, a punishment for all the crimes he's committed, and he
2295280	2297600	sentenced to two years in prison.
2297600	2303880	He even asked to give up his list.
2303880	2308160	On most other shows, this finale is a corner the show would have to write itself out of
2308160	2312360	in the Season 3 premiere, and we would see Earl leave prison at the end of the episode
2312360	2314800	to get back to the usual status quo.
2314800	2320000	Instead, My Name is Earl leaned into this idea of Earl in prison and reinvented itself
2320000	2322000	for its entire third season.
2322000	2325060	The third season can effectively be split into three acts.
2325060	2329640	The first has Earl in prison, the second has Earl in a coma, and the last has Earl as a
2329640	2330640	married man.
2331200	2335240	That's obviously a lot to happen, so let's go through this season in more detail.
2335240	2339720	Earl's life has been improving by working on his list, and as he's done good things,
2339720	2341240	good things have come to him.
2341240	2345400	There were always exceptions when times would get tough, and his faith in karma and the
2345400	2350600	list was tested, but by the end of each episode, he was more or less through the worst of it.
2350600	2354320	It wasn't until the beginning of Season 3 that we see Earl face his most challenging
2354320	2356440	test, going to prison.
2356440	2359960	One of his first real challenges is finding a gang for protection.
2359960	2362440	I'm just saying, I don't see why I have to shave my head.
2362440	2364440	It hates in your heart, not in your hair.
2369200	2371200	Forget it, I'm out.
2371200	2376000	Earl finds a better way of surviving in prison by deciding to stay himself and keep doing
2376000	2377400	good things for others.
2377400	2381880	I realize that no matter how scared I get, I'm going to survive in prison and I have
2381880	2383880	to do it as myself.
2383880	2389800	Because my name isn't inmate number 28301-016, my name is Earl.
2389800	2393480	And while it makes his life in prison better, Earl is still left with the difficult question
2393480	2397520	of how, even though he's doing good things, he's still trapped in prison.
2397520	2402440	At first, it seems as though karma will reward him as his good deeds start leading him toward
2402440	2407200	an early release, with the warden, played by Craig T. Nelson, shaving time off Earl's
2407200	2410560	sentence for each time he assists the warden in some kind of project.
2410560	2413840	Earl, you've got six months and ten days left in here.
2413840	2418720	Now you make this program work and I will give you a certificate for six months off
2418720	2419720	your sentence.
2419720	2424360	But when Earl is getting close to his release, the warden screws him over.
2424360	2427480	I don't know what I would do here without you to cover my ass.
2427480	2430960	Well, I guess you're going to find out tomorrow.
2430960	2432560	Thanks again, sir.
2432560	2442320	A frustrated Earl resorts to making a prison escape.
2442320	2446480	Unfortunately, the escape attempt is foiled, but when Earl finds out the warden formerly
2446480	2461760	had a career in porn, in the episode titled, Early Release.
2461760	2464760	The resolution here doesn't quite work in Earl's mind.
2464760	2469640	He responded to being screwed over by doing something bad using blackmail and now he was
2469640	2478120	being rewarded for it.
2478120	2481640	First Earl is punished for doing something good and then rewarded for doing something
2481640	2482640	bad.
2482640	2484400	So what does that say about karma?
2484400	2489200	In the next episode, Bad Earl, we see Earl revert to his bad ways and he turns his back
2489200	2490320	on the list.
2490320	2508680	In this clip, Earl was filling in for a stripper, hence, the outfit.
2508680	2512560	The episode raises an interesting question of how doing good things can have a selfish
2512560	2513560	motive.
2513560	2515760	Earl wants a reward for his good deeds.
2515760	2519900	As Earl behaves badly, he drifts further from his loved ones and Randy tries to convince
2519900	2535660	him to change back to good Earl with an earnest speech.
2535660	2545260	But it doesn't work.
2545260	2549380	Good things are happening for other people, but for Earl, that isn't enough anymore and
2549380	2575340	he ends up right where he started in the first episode.
2575340	2579180	When Earl finds out the person who hit him is Billy, played by Alyssa Milano, he finally
2579180	2581300	believes he's found his reward.
2581300	2584980	As a quick rewind, Billy is the ex-girlfriend of Frank, a buddy of Earl's who is locked
2584980	2585980	up with him.
2585980	2589900	Part of Earl helping Frank in prison was convincing him to let Billy find a better life without
2589900	2594800	Frank's bad influence and Earl developed a small crush on Billy only to now be reunited
2594800	2596300	when her car hits him.
2596300	2601260	And then karma comes for Billy too.
2601260	2604580	While in a coma, Earl enters a sitcom fantasy land.
2604580	2609140	While trapped there, Randy figures that working on list items will save Earl and so Randy
2609140	2610780	does them in Earl's place.
2610780	2625220	And eventually, Earl is rescued from his coma in the episode, Killer Ball.
2625220	2629020	Earl finds Billy and the two get married and even though Earl used the last of his lottery
2629020	2633980	winnings putting on a prison prom, Billy has come into some insurance money of her own.
2633980	2638500	So the moral of the story, at least at this point, seems to be that if you persevere with
2638500	2643700	karma eventually, through the people you helped, you will receive the reward of being married
2643700	2645700	to Alyssa Milano.
2645700	2648120	Except the season isn't over yet.
2648120	2652540	Over the next few episodes, we find out that marrying a woman because she was your coma
2652540	2658200	fantasy doesn't quite work and Earl realizes that he and Billy are a bad fit.
2658200	2672680	She suggests the worst in the episode, Girl Earl.
2672680	2677360	In the episode, Camdenites, while struggling with Billy, Earl works on his list crossing
2677360	2679840	off Dee Dee, played by Tracy Ashton.
2679840	2683880	The one-legged woman he ran out on was something of a running joke throughout the series so
2683880	2687220	seemed like a big deal for him to finally be tackling this list item.
2687220	2691080	He thought by helping her it would improve his relationship with Billy since this was
2691080	2695340	a woman he'd rung and maybe that's the reason he was having bad luck with women in general.
2695340	2708100	All Dee Dee wants is for Earl to understand her by walking a mile in her shoe.
2708100	2712300	Although Earl thought he would be helping his relationship with Billy by crossing Dee Dee
2712300	2715020	off his list, it doesn't really help.
2715380	2720300	In fact, the only thing that really helps here is that Billy and Earl eventually separate,
2720300	2724860	with Billy adopting a more rustic lifestyle leaving her insurance money with Earl.
2724860	2729500	So at the end of all this hardship, the only thing even resembling a reward for Earl is
2729500	2732940	that he's giving the remnants of Billy's insurance money.
2745100	2749580	And Earl is going to do what he was doing with his lottery winnings and that's help other people.
2768780	2773980	In addition to the fact that Billy being a reward is pretty creepy, as a person shouldn't
2773980	2775740	be a prize to be won.
2775740	2779900	The overarching message of this season is that Earl should not be doing good for any
2779900	2782060	sort of external reward.
2782060	2785940	He should be doing it because he's internally motivated to do good for others.
2785940	2789420	In the first two seasons, you might argue that Earl still imagined he'd get some magical
2789420	2794200	reward at the end of his list, but the third season establishes that this journey may not
2794200	2796580	end with some sort of grand reward.
2796580	2801580	Rather, the reason to do this is not some fabulous cash prize like an even bigger lottery
2801580	2806460	winnings, but instead feel that personal satisfaction with his life, the joy that comes
2806460	2807860	from helping others.
2807860	2812420	At the end of season 3, Earl's life appears the same on the outside, but on the inside
2812420	2814380	he's grown into a better version of himself.
2814380	2817220	He's now doing good deeds for a better reason.
2817220	2820500	You might say that's still kind of selfish because he's getting a good feeling from
2820500	2824580	helping others, but going from an external reward to an internal one, skipping the need
2824580	2828600	for material comforts to get that good feeling, has shown Earl a simpler and more effective
2828600	2833320	way of enjoying his life, and had the series run longer, maybe his drive to do good things
2833320	2835760	could have been explored on an even deeper level.
2835760	2840920	But sadly, this giant step in season 3 is the only one we get in the series.
2840920	2846280	Structurally, the third season was also very different when compared to how other sitcoms
2846280	2848680	tend to tell long-form stories.
2848680	2852760	In most of the shows that have done similar things with season-long arcs, they're not
2852760	2855320	quite as comprehensive as My Name is Earl's.
2855320	2859120	Some examples would include the second season of Cheers, where we saw Sam and Diane trying
2859120	2863680	to be a couple, the fourth season of Parks and Rec with Leslie Knope running for office,
2863680	2867780	and the fifth season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air with Will and Lisa falling in love.
2867780	2872160	But the difference between My Name is Earl's season-long arc and these other shows is that,
2872160	2876500	while most other arcs featured change to a show's premise to create different dynamics
2876500	2881520	in each episode, telling standalone episodes that simply reflect that new premise, My Name
2881520	2886560	is Earl used a season-long arc to tell a much bigger, more complicated story.
2886560	2890760	It tested Earl's commitment to karma and examined what really motivated him.
2890760	2895680	It helped him realize the difference between a desire to do good and a desire for a reward.
2895680	2899080	And Earl's understanding of that dynamic changes throughout the season as we see him
2899080	2901680	in many different circumstances.
2901680	2906320	And at the end of it all, he grows and evolves as a character in a way that you don't typically
2906320	2908360	see in other shows.
2908360	2912440	Season 3 did draw some criticisms from the audience though, particularly the part where
2912440	2914400	Earl was trapped in a coma.
2914400	2918720	While referencing classic sitcoms within new ones is a cute idea, later on the show seemed
2918720	2923780	to acknowledge that certain members of the audience weren't too keen on this meta-joke.
2923780	2936680	This is a clip referencing that in the fourth season episode, Inside Probe Part 1.
2936680	2940140	And one interesting artifact of this season is that, when the show had a lengthy break
2940140	2944960	because of the writers' strike from 2007 to 2008, it came back with a recap ahead of
2944960	2955760	its return episode delivered by NBC Universal CEO and President Jeff Zucker.
2955760	2960520	This weird intro was not well-received and even led to a short article on Deadline, an
2960520	2964760	entertainment industry outlet, asking if Zucker had lost his mind.
2964760	2969040	It was actually Greg Garcia's idea to have Zucker do this intro, but even so, the intro
2969040	2971120	would be scrubbed from the DVD release.
2971120	2975400	And before leaving Season 3 entirely, I do want to highlight a surprisingly good trans
2975400	2989520	joke.
2989520	2992600	I think it's important to highlight that joke because, while there are other jokes
2992600	2997360	in the series that are less kind, including the use of a transphobic slur, this good joke
2997360	3001400	reveals the capacity to learn and improve from that previous bad behavior, just like
3001400	3002400	Earl.
3002400	3006400	Although it should be mentioned that a cis man in a dress is not good casting for a trans
3006400	3010160	woman, so it's still very much a work in progress.
3010160	3011160	Just like Earl.
3011160	3017920	And I have to acknowledge another moment in Season 3 where Randy is encouraging some anti-jose
3017920	3031040	violence.
3031040	3035720	As a Jose, this anti-jose nonsense is deeply disappointing and I hope the show will do
3035720	3036720	better.
3036720	3041920	Just do better.
3041920	3044960	There are a lot of flashbacks in the series.
3044960	3047600	Some of them go on for nearly a whole episode.
3047600	3053320	An early example being Season 1's Y2K episode where we see how Earl, Joy, Randy, Darnell,
3053320	3057760	and Donny, played by Silas Weir Mitchell, handle the impending technological apocalypse
3057760	3066280	that never was.
3066280	3069680	My Name is Earl is a show defined by the past of its characters.
3069680	3073240	Earl's past of wrongdoings is an obvious one, but in the case of other members of the
3073240	3076720	cast, their pasts are also a big part of their characters.
3076720	3080960	Catalina is a character whose past gradually gets revealed in the first half of this series.
3080960	3085120	Not just that she entered the US illegally, but also that, before she became a hotel maid,
3085120	3089760	she worked as a stripper at Club Chubby, a job she goes back to in the Season 2 episode
3089760	3090760	Jump for Joy.
3090760	3095520	And in Season 2's mailbox, we get a slow burn reveal where we find out Catalina has
3095520	3102220	killed someone.
3102220	3112700	This is followed up in Season 3's The Frank Factor.
3112700	3115160	This is a nice example of continuity on the show.
3115160	3119340	If Earl's story is about him realizing the impact of his past on his present, the same
3119340	3121380	is true for other characters too.
3121380	3125540	We learn more about Catalina's past when she is deported, and Earl and Randy have to
3125540	3129100	rescue her in the Season 2 two-parter south of the border.
3129100	3133860	Although she's sent to what we're told is her hometown in Mexico, later on in the
3133860	3138780	series it's revealed that Catalina is from La Paz, which is the capital of Bolivia.
3138780	3142540	This is an example of the show playing fast and loose with its continuity.
3142540	3147160	It's pretty common for sitcoms to place comedy over continuity, but it's a bit more noticeable
3147160	3151500	in My Name is Earl, where a character's history is the basis of so much of what they
3151500	3156860	do in the series, and the show certainly doesn't help itself with the many flashbacks it includes.
3156860	3160740	That all said, there are enough consistent facts to make sense of these characters'
3160740	3161740	history.
3161740	3167180	Regardless of whether it's her home country or not, Mexico is where Catalina is deported
3167180	3168180	to.
3168180	3171660	And Randy marries Catalina so she can come back to America.
3171660	3174980	Of course, as we already talked about, it doesn't work out for them.
3174980	3178700	And it's around here that Catalina's character seems to drift around a bit, as if there was
3178700	3180740	no definite plans for her.
3180740	3184460	While she's a fun addition to the cast and an interesting character, the key to making
3184460	3187180	her interesting is often done by explaining her history.
3187180	3191200	We see this whole truth for Darnell as well, a character who is very mysterious in the
3191200	3195180	early seasons, as the only clue we get to his history is that he's in the witness
3195180	3199020	relocation program and his name used to be Harry Monroe.
3199020	3202760	It isn't until the show's fourth season we finally get some answers as to who Harry
3202760	3206100	Monroe is in the two-parter Darnell outed.
3206100	3210780	While, as mentioned earlier, a lot of this two-parter is dedicated to Joy trying to show
3210780	3215620	up Erika Strada and prove she can be a celebrity, what complicates the plan is Darnell appearing
3215620	3233540	on national television and having his cover identity blown.
3233540	3238420	In My Name is Alias, a few episodes later, we get a more complete answer as to who Darnell
3238420	3255500	is when his secret agent father, played by Danny Glover, comes to make amends with him.
3255500	3259500	Darnell left his life as a government assassin when he was asked to kill a child.
3259500	3263780	When he testified against the agency in front of a subcommittee, the agency wanted revenge
3263780	3266740	and Darnell had to go into witness protection.
3266740	3270340	While this history for Darnell wasn't planned from the beginning, the show's creators
3270340	3284540	always knew he'd have a wild backstory.
3284540	3287900	These revelations do contradict the fact that we saw Darnell's family in the season one
3287900	3291900	episode Joy's Wedding, though that's explained away as them being other people in the witness
3291900	3293300	protection program.
3293300	3296620	Both Darnell and Catalina are their most interesting when their pasts confront them
3296620	3300220	in the present, along with the show's many flashbacks and Earl's quests.
3300220	3304180	This is how change over time is represented in the series, and it gives the impression
3304180	3308580	that these characters are more rich and detailed than what little we may see them do within
3308580	3310580	the context of an episode.
3310580	3313420	There's always the subtle suggestion that there's more to these characters than meets
3313420	3317620	the eye, and some part of their past is just waiting to leap out from the shadows.
3317620	3321660	Catalina and Darnell are both similar to Earl in that they're happier in the present because
3321660	3324140	of the choices they've made to live happier lives.
3324140	3327900	They certainly aren't perfect, but the worst conditions of their past are a reminder of
3327900	3332460	why they chose to leave their old lives in Bolivia and as a secret agent, respectively.
3332460	3334640	They were miserable in both places.
3334640	3338300	Much like Earl making a list of wrongdoings and making up for them, the changes Catalina
3338300	3339980	and Darnell make were a challenge.
3339980	3344420	Leaving a life behind, no matter how you do it, is always difficult, but part of the show's
3344420	3348660	optimism comes from that willingness to make a try against difficult odds, and the courage
3348660	3358540	it takes to remake your own life.
3358540	3363020	Camden County is one of those fictional places in a TV show that never gets a precise location
3363020	3364420	in the real world.
3364420	3368620	The closest we get to any confirmation is that it definitely is not the same Camden
3368620	3370220	County in New Jersey.
3370220	3374220	Its local accent and complete lack of snow at Christmas time suggest it's somewhere
3374220	3377460	in the southern US, but it's hard to be more precise than that.
3377460	3382580	We can contrast this to the vaguely named Big City in the season 1 episode, Stole P's
3382580	3387140	HD Cart, where we see Earl struggle to get any justice from a big corporation trying
3387140	3401980	to muscle a local hot dog cart out of Camden.
3401980	3417020	That Earl learns an important truth.
3417020	3421660	This episode has a fun message about how corporations exploit labor and that real restorative justice
3421660	3426180	involves going Robin Hood on a big corporation, but there's another larger message here
3426180	3430720	about how the people of Camden, especially Earl and his friends, exist outside the world
3430720	3432680	of white shirts and ties.
3432680	3437000	This needs to be understood as not a complete rejection of living in a society, as we see
3437000	3441160	Earl learn the value of having a functioning government in the season 1 episode didn't
3441160	3442160	pay taxes.
3442160	3452880	Earl's vision of a more just world is one where people help other people, and the world
3452880	3457120	of big business, represented by the big city, is a rejection of that ethos.
3457120	3460320	It embraces selfishness and the exploitation of others.
3460320	3463920	Camden doesn't feel like a real place because it operates on such a heightened sense
3463920	3468120	of reality, which is probably why it doesn't feel unrealistic for Earl's change of heart
3468120	3470000	to have such a wide ripple effect.
3470000	3474520	But it cuts in other ways too, such as in the season 2 episode, Van Hickey, where Earl's
3474520	3494320	longtime friend, Ralph, played by Giovanni Rubisi, threatens to kill him.
3494320	3498600	The impact of this dynamic is explained well in the DVD audio commentary for that episode.
3498600	3508960	Camden is a place where some scary stuff goes down, and you can believe characters
3508960	3510880	when they say they're going to try to kill someone.
3510880	3514920	But in that heightened sense of reality, there's also the possibility to do some good.
3514920	3519440	As we go through the series, Earl's good deeds create new friends wherever he goes,
3519440	3523200	helping shape the community into one where everybody helps each other rather than compete
3523200	3524520	against each other.
3524520	3527920	But this isn't just a rejection of the capitalist mindset.
3527920	3532340	It goes a step further by presenting Camden, and Earl's social circle, as a meeting place
3532340	3543920	for all types of people.
3543920	3548360	In season 2, with the episode Sticks and Stones, we get a great example when Earl tries to
3548360	3552280	make up for teasing a girl who had facial hair in school and then finds himself in a
3552280	3573880	small community of circus performers.
3573880	3578080	As Earl learns more about the performers as people, he also learns to identify with them
3578080	3581920	when he's reminded he was teased for having Harry Nipples as a kid.
3581920	3585400	The episode ends with Earl facing his fear and going off the high dive with his shirt
3585400	3589560	off, and he's joined by the performers who refuse to hide away in their private community.
3589560	3593520	It's about learning to have some pride, even if you're a little different, and that
3593520	3595680	we're all a little different in our own ways.
3595680	3600320	It's a pretty basic message, but the series is more than just bringing in people for an
3600320	3603280	episode to say, hey, they're decent people too.
3603280	3607280	A lot of these characters appear again throughout the series, much in the way Kenny became a
3607280	3609480	series regular after the premiere.
3609480	3613120	These characters don't just show up to teach Earl a lesson, they become active members
3613120	3614360	of his community.
3614360	3619000	We see another example in season 1's Teacher Earl, where Earl teaches English as a second
3619000	3637840	language to make up for all the times he's made fun of people with accents.
3637840	3642600	Actually something ironic here about the actor who plays Neskabar a lob-lop, Abdul-e-Ngom,
3642600	3647400	he actually speaks at least five languages, or six depending on who you believe in the
3647400	3651760	DVD commentaries, or maybe seven if you believe everything you read on the internet.
3651760	3655520	Although the depiction has some of these people borders on the offensive, the series seems
3655520	3659520	to develop in its depictions of these characters the same way Earl learns to be more sensitive
3659520	3661040	to people who are different.
3661040	3664840	Much like the circus performers, Neskabar becomes a regular in the series in a lot of
3664840	3684880	fun and creative ways.
3684880	3690880	When the series begins, Earl's concept of us is just him and Randy, but as it progresses,
3690880	3695960	that us grows to include so many more people, not just the obvious editions of Joy, Darnell,
3695960	3701920	and Catalina, but also the people he would place in the very undesirable bucket of them.
3701920	3706960	And importantly, not just to Earl, a lot of these people who become part of the us label
3706960	3711760	are often marginalized by society with little access to power, keeping them perpetually
3711760	3714440	trapped under the label of them.
3714440	3719000	Immigrants and people born a little different have every right to be a part of our communities.
3719000	3722560	Any us worth making is one that includes these people too.
3722560	3727260	In the season two episode, our cops is on, we get a sense of how big the us is getting
3727260	3730160	with numerous cameos from the people of Camden.
3730160	3734000	A nice bit of subtext in this episode is that even though their lives and relationships
3734000	3738360	weren't being improved by Earl in his list since the episode predates it, it does show
3738360	3741440	us that they were all in community with one another already.
3741440	3745000	They were just either strangers or hostile to one another.
3745000	3748960	The fact that they're all sitting here laughing, drinking, and watching this episode together
3748960	3754160	reinforces the transformative nature of doing good deeds and the impact it has on the community.
3754160	3758840	In the season three episode, Camdenites, when Earl has to untip Joy's trailer, which he
3758840	3762880	drugingly tipped over a few episodes earlier, he's assisted by all the people of Camden
3762880	3764680	he's helped out over the years.
3764680	3768080	When I was doing bad things, no one would help me with anything, but now that I was
3768080	3771640	doing good things, I had lots of friends willing to pitch in.
3771640	3775680	And they prove that by working together, they can make their whole community a better place.
3775680	3778000	And that doing good is infectious.
3778640	3782560	Now, everybody just calm down.
3782560	3788220	On May 14th, 2009, the final episode of My Name Is Earl aired, although it wasn't meant
3788220	3789720	to be the finale.
3789720	3794040	Titled Dodge's Dad, the episode centers around Joy finding out that Dodge, her eldest
3794040	3798400	son, isn't actually the son of Little Chubby, played by Norm Macdonald.
3798400	3803840	It turns out that Earl, who raised Dodge thinking he was another man's son, is actually Dodge's
3803840	3804840	biological father.
3804840	3805840	No.
3805840	3806840	Yep.
3806840	3807840	No.
3808680	3811400	If anything, you did me, I was drunk.
3811400	3814020	This is one of the dangers of hooking up at a costume party.
3814020	3818800	But even more shocking than the Dodge revelation is that Earl Jr. isn't actually Darnell's
3818800	3819800	son.
3819800	3824000	These three DNAs match, that means it's you and the boys, which makes this one mine
3824000	3827040	and it doesn't match any of those.
3827040	3828040	What does that mean?
3828040	3830240	It means I'm not Earl Jr.'s father.
3830240	3833680	And the last line we ever hear from the series is Joy saying,
3833680	3837240	Now, everybody just calm down.
3837240	3840360	And we got a giant message saying, to be continued.
3840360	3842000	Only it wasn't.
3842000	3845720	Although My Name is Earl premiered to very strong ratings, it gradually slipped as the
3845720	3847160	seasons rolled on.
3847160	3851400	For its fourth season, it had fallen to 60 second place in the ratings, Far Cry from
3851400	3853160	its debut at 22nd.
3853160	3858040	But it is strange that it was cancelled while other NBC shows such as Chuck and Parks and
3858040	3861880	Recreation, both with lower ratings, were both renewed.
3861880	3865960	Whatever the reason, going into that episode, creator Greg Garcia was under the impression
3865960	3868440	that this would not be the final season.
3868440	3872400	Codd completely flat-footed, the only sign that this might be the final episode is the
3872400	3876760	production company tag at the end where we see a partially shaved Jason Lee.
3876760	3880280	Even that suggests that maybe they're not entirely done yet.
3880280	3884220	After being cancelled by NBC, there were talks with several networks to pick up the series,
3884220	3886400	with TBS being a strong contender.
3886400	3891340	But ultimately, the cost of the series to fulfill its creative vision was just too much
3891340	3893460	for any other network to sign on.
3893460	3897740	And so Earl's ending would remain, at least for now, untold.
3897740	3903740	In a 2013 Reddit Ask Me Anything, Greg Garcia was asked how the series was meant to end.
3903740	3908400	This answer remains our best look at what the future held for Earl Hickey.
3908400	3911940	We never really got the chance to fully figure it out, but the talk in the writers room was
3911940	3917540	that Earl Jr's dad was going to be someone famous, like Dave Chappelle or Lil Jon, someone
3917540	3920760	that came to town on tour and Joy slept with.
3920760	3924160	But when we got cancelled, we never got the chance to figure it out.
3924160	3927960	I was worried about doing a cliffhanger, but I asked NBC if it was safe to do one at the
3927960	3930160	end of the season and they told me it was.
3930160	3931460	I guess it wasn't.
3931460	3936320	I had always had an ending to Earl, and I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to see it happen.
3936320	3940400	You've got a show about a guy with a list, so not seeing him finish it is a bummer, but
3940400	3943380	the truth is he wasn't ever going to finish the list.
3943380	3947720	The basic idea of the ending was that, while he was stuck on a really hard list item, he
3947720	3951200	was going to start to get frustrated that he was never going to finish it.
3951200	3954320	Then he runs into someone who had a list of their own and Earl was on it.
3954320	3957080	They needed to make up for something bad they had done to Earl.
3957080	3960900	He asks them where they got the idea for making a list and they tell him that someone came
3960900	3964200	to them with a list and that person got the idea from someone else.
3964200	3969080	Earl eventually realizes that his list started a chain reaction of people with lists and
3969080	3972200	that he's finally put more good into the world than bad.
3972200	3975400	So at that point, he was going to tear up his list and go live his life.
3975400	3980640	Talk into the sunset of Freeman with good karma.
3980640	3984220	There are some interesting post scripts to My Name is Earl's cancellation, such as
3984220	3987000	the show not being the only thing that was cancelled.
3987000	3990400	Anyone who purchased the first DVD set of the series would have seen this fancy little
3990400	3995040	flyer advertising a My Name is Earl comic coming from Oni Press.
3995040	3998520	When asked about this, Greg Garcia explained that this project was abandoned because he
3998520	4001600	would have lacked the creative control over it he would have liked.
4001600	4005400	One project that followed My Name is Earl that did come to fruition was Garcia's next
4005400	4007360	series, Raising Hope.
4007360	4009480	Garcia described the inspiration for the series saying,
4009480	4013440	The main inspiration for Raising Hope was the anger over the fact that they cancelled
4013440	4014440	My Name is Earl.
4014440	4018300	I wanted to do another single camera comedy so I could quickly hire the same crew that
4018300	4020600	I had loved working with for four years.
4020600	4024880	I was interested in doing a domestic comedy so I thought of the most twisted way I could
4024880	4029280	of putting a baby in a house full of people that had no idea what to do with it.
4029280	4032720	In addition to bringing back his crew, a number of cast members from My Name is Earl
4032720	4035080	made cameos throughout the series' run.
4035080	4038800	There were also some cute nods to the abrupt cancellation of My Name is Earl, such as one
4038800	4056000	of the characters on Raising Hope revealing that they were a fan.
4056000	4060940	It would take a whole video to list every reference to My Name is Earl on Raising Hope,
4060940	4065360	but I did at least want to mention the season 3 episode making the band which almost felt
4065360	4080880	like an alternate reality episode of My Name is Earl.
4080880	4084720	And that's more or less that we got from the residents of Camden County following the
4084720	4086240	show's cancellation.
4086240	4090640	Jason Lee did say in a 2020 interview that he was interested in giving the show a proper
4090640	4094740	wrap-up though so far no concrete plans have emerged.
4094740	4099000	While working on My Name is Earl, Jason Lee also starred in the first Alvin and the Chipmunks
4099000	4104160	live-action movie as Dave Seville, a role he'd reprise in its various squeak-walls.
4104160	4107280	He also appeared on The Memphis Beat and Up All Night.
4107280	4111120	He's largely stepped away from acting in recent years though he's expressed interest
4111120	4115440	in reviving older projects he's worked on such as mall rats and of course My Name
4115440	4116440	is Earl.
4116440	4119680	Ethan Suppley has appeared in a number of roles on TV and film after the end of the
4119680	4124440	series including roles in The Wolf of Wall Street, Dog, and The Ranch.
4124440	4129280	In 2014, he reunited with former My Name is Earl co-star Jamie Pressley in the series
4129280	4130720	Jennifer Falls.
4130720	4134960	Jamie Pressley has worked on a number of projects following the cancellation of My Name is Earl.
4134960	4139160	In addition to the short-lived Jennifer Falls with Ethan Suppley, Pressley also appeared
4139160	4144880	on Welcome to Flash, I Hate My Teenage Daughter, and she appeared on seven seasons of the series
4144880	4146300	Mom.
4146300	4150960	After My Name is Earl, Eddie Steeples appeared in the TV series The Guest Book and the movies
4150960	4156780	Hot Seat and Jujitsu, currently scheduled to appear in the upcoming movie Fallen Cards.
4156780	4161380	Since My Name is Earl, Nadine Velasquez appeared on the series The League and the movies Snitch
4161380	4162600	and Flight.
4162600	4167160	Most recently she appeared as a part of the principal cast in the ABC series Queens.
4167160	4171200	My Name is Earl is an unfinished story of redemption and in a way, that story could
4171200	4172640	never be finished.
4172640	4176480	Throughout the series we see Earl make right the wrong deeds of the past, but we also see
4176480	4180440	him make mistakes along the way, having to add new items to his list.
4180440	4184780	It's likely that the work on the list will never be completed and the desire to be an
4184780	4189120	ideal person is not going to be completed by Earl himself but will have to be a quest
4189120	4191080	picked up by the people around him.
4191080	4194680	As you can tell from that imaginative finale from Greg Garcia, that was the whole point
4194680	4198720	of the series, that doing good doesn't end with some ultimate reward waiting for
4198720	4203280	you but rather doing good makes the world a better place and that doing good inspires
4203280	4207920	others to do the same, with your reward being able to be part of that better world you all
4207920	4208920	share together.
4208920	4213440	It expands the idea of doing good from a solitary exercise to something more communal.
4213440	4217640	We aren't waiting for an Earl to come save us because we can all start on our own lists
4217640	4220840	right now and we can all make the world better together.
4220840	4224400	The cancellation of My Name is Earl will probably always sting because there's so much more
4224400	4227880	growth we could have seen in the series and ending with a cliffhanger is usually not
4227880	4229840	a good way to leave off characters.
4229840	4233180	Even if Earl was never going to finish that list, we could have at least seen his new
4233180	4237560	struggles with fatherhood or Darnell's changing relationship with the boy he thought was his
4237560	4242440	biological son or even just Joy tracking down Earl Jr's real father.
4242440	4245760	These are the lingering questions that could use a few more episodes or a movie to wrap
4245760	4246760	up.
4246760	4251000	But Four Seasons is a lot more than most other shows get and in that four there's still
4251000	4255080	a lot of good stuff to be found about the value of trying to be a better person.
4255080	4257280	And it's the trying that's the key.
4257280	4260760	No one will ever be perfect and Earl certainly never is.
4260760	4265280	But his example shows us that anyone, even a dirtbag with no education and a lengthy
4265280	4268040	rap sheet, can try to make the world a better place.
4268040	4274800	All it takes is believing in karma and starting with a list.
4274800	4277940	This will probably come as a surprise to anyone who's watched these retrospectives but I
4277940	4282060	usually don't have to go out of my way to find a series.
4282060	4287140	Most shows that are classics are found streaming pretty much anywhere and special features
4287140	4291640	and documentaries and whatnot take a bit of digging but can be found with some effort.
4291640	4296140	My Name is Earl was the first time I actually had to track down physical media in the form
4296140	4302100	of old DVDs basically doing a lot more work just so I would have as much information as
