0	3500	This was the longest week of my life.
11600	16320	Tim Poole is a person with a YouTube channel. Two channels, actually.
16320	20400	He produces about six videos daily where he comments on the news of the day.
20400	26640	He is not a popular guy on the left. To hear him tell it, it's because the left has lost its mind.
27120	31120	While I've watched a few of his videos in the past, and even made a response to one of them,
31120	35280	I wanted to see what a week-long trek through the world of his content would produce.
35280	40480	This video covers all the video content created by Tim Poole from December 15th
40480	44800	to December 21st in 2019. Let's dive right in.
45600	56480	By far, the biggest story of that week in the US political world was the vote in Congress
56480	62720	to impeach President Donald Trump. Of the 42 videos Tim produced, 11 were about impeachment
62720	68800	in one way or another. They had titles such as Democrat Slammed by protest as impeachment
68800	77040	support collapses. Majority now oppose impeachment. Impeachment backfire gets worse as Trump now
77040	84160	defeats every 2020 Democrat in major polling. Democrats have not impeached Trump. Democrats
84160	90400	own witness undermines Pelosi's strategy. Gee, I wonder why people would think this guy is right-wing.
91120	95840	These, obviously, clickbait titles are how Tim advertises his political videos.
95840	101040	The Democrats are consistently on the verge of collapse and the Republicans are on an endless
101040	105840	winning streak. But to hear Tim tell it, he's actually trying to help the Democrats by offering
105840	111440	honest criticism. The only problem is he has no idea what he's talking about. Tim has an
111440	116320	interesting take on the Trump impeachment proceedings. He believes it's a top-to-bottom
116320	122080	farce. To Tim, Trump not only has done nothing wrong, but the Democrats have been lawless in
122080	126960	pursuing him, and the subject of the investigation should be Joe Biden. One of the annoying things
126960	132080	about watching his videos is how rarely he explains why he believes the things he believes.
132080	137360	Of the 11 impeachment videos, only two really outline his case. I suppose he went into detail
137360	141760	in previous videos, which would be fine if he told his viewers where they could get more information,
141760	146320	like say a link to relevant videos. Instead, his channel is set up so that you have to have some
146320	150480	knowledge of right-wing narratives to believe anything that he's saying, or even to really
150480	156800	follow it. Not that it would help, because he's very wrong on impeachment. To be fair, Tim doesn't
156800	161600	want us to take his legal expertise on the matter, though. Here's an example of Tim trying to use an
161600	168080	expert to cite the claim that impeachment is baseless. Congress is claiming Trump obstructed
168080	175520	Congress by rejecting these subpoenas. Trump's argument is that he has executive privilege,
175520	180960	this information, and he's under no obligation to turn it over without judicial review.
182160	187840	And it sounds like he's right. Why does Alan Dershowitz have authority on this?
188800	192000	Famous Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden supporter Alan Dershowitz says,
192640	199120	so Tim's position relies not on the merit of the argument, but on his status as a Clinton and Biden
199120	204240	supporter. He's using Dershowitz's identity to support his claim, ignoring the many people who
204320	207840	disagree with him. For example, one of Dershowitz's own students.
207840	212960	Abusive power was rejected, and terms like that, as explicit grounds for impeachment.
212960	217600	No, that's not true, Alan. Look, that's not, abusive power was not rejected.
217600	221680	Yes, there were. There was, well, the word maladministration is rejected explicitly.
221680	224640	Maladministration is a totally different thing.
224640	228720	It's also worth noting that Dershowitz is currently advising the Trump administration
228720	232480	on impeachment proceedings, but that's only looking at the second article of impeachment,
232480	237200	obstruction of Congress, during the impeachment process. Tim's dismissal of the first article
237200	242080	is even more laughable. For those unfamiliar, the short version of the obstruction of power
242080	246800	claim is that President Trump withheld aid to Ukraine that had been appropriated by Congress
246800	251840	to pressure the president of Ukraine to either investigate or announce an investigation into Joe
251840	258960	Biden and his son Hunter, and also to investigate Ukraine's supposed influence on the 2016 election.
258960	264480	Tim finds these allegations absurd. One of the claims he seriously makes is that in no way was
264480	269040	Donald Trump worried about Joe Biden. Why would Trump be scared of Biden of all people? And Biden
269040	274640	even won the nomination yet. It's a lie. Articles published as far back in March of this year,
274640	279200	a few months before Trump's conversation with the president of Ukraine, suggest that Trump was
279200	283760	definitely worried about Biden. While Biden certainly isn't my favorite Democrat in the
283760	288480	field, he's undeniably the front-runner, and has been for as long as he's been in the Democratic
288480	293520	primary. To say Trump is not concerned about Biden or that he doesn't consider him a political
293520	299040	rival is to be willfully ignorant. Tim then tries to describe Trump's state of mind on why he
299040	304400	withheld the money. I think for one, Trump doesn't want to give U.S. money to foreign countries. I
304400	308240	think that's a fact. He's withholding aid from like Lebanon or other countries. I don't think
308240	313920	Ukraine is special. So this is something Trump does all the time, but Democrats are arbitrarily
313920	318560	choosing this case, even though this is a specific type of military aid that Congress
318560	322400	voted on giving to Ukraine. But even that isn't the real reason Trump is doing this.
322400	325200	Let's listen to Tim tell us the real reason Trump is doing this.
343920	345840	Because he's upset about this.
345840	350960	Tim believes Trump triggered the investigation as a form of retribution for all the lies the media
350960	355360	and the Democrats have supposedly been throwing at him. And Tim doesn't think that using the
355360	359840	office of the president and U.S. foreign policy to go after your political rivals is an abuse of
359840	364720	power. Of course, that's also not the real reason. Let's hear Tim give us the real reason once again,
364720	369040	and this time it's Trump isn't doing it out of anger, but it's because he really cares about
369120	374560	America. Trump said, do us a favor, though, because our country has been through a lot.
374560	379280	He was clearly talking about us as America. And if you want to argue, you got to argue
379280	382560	from the facts, but they don't do that. They say Trump demanded a favor. Trump said,
382560	386480	I want to favor. He never said that. So they keep going up. They say it's not disputed,
386480	391360	but they've never presented any evidence that Trump's frame of mind in that conversation had
391360	395360	anything to do with Biden. As a quick aside, Biden was mentioned specifically in the conversation,
395360	400400	which I believe proves Trump was thinking about him to some degree. But the important point is
400400	405520	none of what Tim is saying holds together. Trump didn't care about Biden during this conversation,
405520	409600	but he did mention him by name as a person to be investigated. Trump withheld the money
409600	413600	as part of standard policy, but Tim also acknowledges it was a partisan attack on
413600	418000	political rivals. But also, it wasn't about that. It was about his love of country.
418000	421760	Perhaps there's some nuance here I'm missing, but after watching these videos, I'm not sure
421760	427440	Tim knows what he thinks about this. The only constant in all of these videos is the narrative
427440	432480	that Trump needs to be considered innocent, regardless of the justifications. This is how
432480	436240	narrative is used to reshape the facts. You can talk about what's happening in the news,
436240	440000	but the facts are being distorted to reinforce the narrative that Trump did nothing wrong.
440000	444000	Contradictions don't matter, and neither do objective facts, just the narrative.
444720	449280	Here's another example of how Tim misrepresents reality to push a Trump innocence narrative.
449280	453680	Tim really wants to hammer home the idea that Trump hasn't committed any statutory crimes,
453680	458240	so this whole impeachment process doesn't meet the standards of high crimes and misdemeanors.
459120	462960	All of the other presidents who actually faced impeachment were being charged with statutory
462960	470160	crimes. Trump is the first president to face no statutory crime. And about 40 seconds before that,
470160	475120	he asserts something I want us to remember. He would rightly defer to the expert opinion of
475200	479920	an academic on the constitution over a journalist. If you're an academic and you're an expert on
479920	484480	the constitution and you say Trump was unimpeached, I defer to you over the journalist. If you think
484480	489280	Trump should be impeached on these issues, I will still defer to you over the journalists.
489280	493440	He's completely right when he says this, but he's also completely wrong when he says the phrase
493440	498720	high crimes and misdemeanors means that statutory crimes must be a part of the impeachment process.
498720	504160	In an article for The Atlantic, Frank O. Bowman III, a professor at the University of Missouri
504160	508080	School of Law who literally wrote a book on the phrase high crimes and misdemeanors,
508080	513200	goes into detail about the origin of the phrase and how it most certainly applies to abuse of power,
513200	517680	and doesn't require any statutory crimes to have been committed. Here are a few excerpts from that
517680	523280	article that provide historical context. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton made the
523280	528960	larger point that impeachment is directed at political offenses that proceed from the abuse
528960	534240	or violation of some public trust. He provides a number of examples of people being impeached
534240	538880	without having committed a crime, and he offers a famous hypothetical and one of his own to
538880	545600	illustrate the subject even further. Suppose, he imagined, that in 1861, when secession fever broke
545600	551840	out, the president had not been Abraham Lincoln but a man who, whether moved by fear or an honest
551840	556640	but perverted political theory, refused to mobilize the union against the rebellion.
556640	561040	Would we say that the only remedy in such a case was to allow dissolution of the country because
561040	566720	the president's inaction was no crime? Or suppose to bring the case still closer to home,
566720	571440	a president were to subordinate himself and the interests of his own country to a foreign power
571440	576160	because he or his family could make money by doing so, or because the foreign country agreed
576160	580720	to help him secure a re-election. Does anyone seriously suggest that the question of whether
580720	587280	such behavior is impeachable turns on the niceties of ethics rules or campaign finance laws?
587280	591680	So why does Tim continue on with this obviously wrong narrative of impeachment having no merit
591680	596160	because no statutory crimes have been leveled against President Trump? It's because it supports
596160	600880	the narrative he loves so dearly, and that's that the Democrats are not only insane, but their
600880	606800	supporters are complete fools. Tim, apparently, can't understand why the Democrats are impeaching
606800	611280	Trump. Maybe they're sitting there being like, Trump, if Trump's going to get reelected, he needs
611280	615680	a good villain, so they're all going to pretend to be it. Obviously I'm joking, but I can't imagine
615680	619520	why else they would be doing this. But then he figures out the Democrats are actually on a
619520	627280	suicide mission. Rocking a hard place? Whatever. Impeachment. This is the Democrats' final salvo.
627280	633840	It's their kamikaze. They've lost, they know it, and it's all they have left. And then he finally
633840	639520	lands on what is quite possibly the most ridiculous explanation as to why Democrats
639520	643680	are impeaching Trump. I think the reality is the Democrats know their constituents,
644400	649680	these these resistance types are not very smart or are lacking information. They're ignorant.
649680	655600	I'm not trying to be mean, but it's true. Tim Poole thinks that the Democrats are trying to
655600	662000	fool their base into thinking Trump has been removed from office. In what world does this
662000	668000	make any sense? Does he think the Democratic voters are so stupid that they won't notice Trump
668000	673120	is still in office between now and the election? Tim's evidence for this outrageous claim is
673120	678080	provided in a different video because he's very bad at what he does and doesn't evidence claims
678080	682720	when he first makes them. Liberals on Twitter think impeachment means Trump is getting kicked
682720	687040	out of office. His evidence is random people on Twitter. I don't think that really meets the
687040	691760	standard of a scientific poll and it's not really a demonstration that this is a widespread problem,
691760	696400	but it does meet Tim's standard of cherry-picking facts to buttress a narrative of the left being
696400	702720	made up of people detached from reality. He also has another theory on why Democrats are being so
702720	708240	supposedly self-destructive. Should I believe that she thinks she's actually doing something here?
708240	712320	Because we all know Trump isn't going to be removed from office. So why laugh and smile as
712320	717600	you go to impeach him? Because it feels good? Or is it because you want to watch the world burn?
717600	723840	Rashida Tlaib just wants to see the world burn. She is, in fact, the Joker. But Tim,
723840	729040	in an effort to speak to his fellow liberals, does occasionally offer political advice. And wow,
729040	733680	this may be the worst of his commentary. For instance, here's a slogan he recommended to
733680	739280	Democrats. If the Democrats' whole campaign was Trump's not that bad, we'll be a little bit better,
739280	744400	they would be much, much better off than where they are today with protests erupting at their
744400	749680	town hall meetings. Democrats should run on a vaguely pro-Trump sentiment that they're only
749680	754240	going to do a little bit better? Does he not understand that Donald Trump has never been a
754240	758800	popular president? And how does this appeal to Democratic voters who, generally speaking,
758800	764080	don't like Trump? But that's not the end of his awful advice. Tim repeatedly mentions Democrats
764080	769600	have nothing to offer and need new ideas to sway the public. I think the only conclusion we have
769600	774000	is the Democrats are campaigning on things no one cares about. They're saying nothing,
774000	777920	no one cares what they have to say. Interesting point, and totally true, if you ignore the
777920	782560	Democratic primary, which had been going on this whole week. You know, the primary, where they're
782560	787680	discussing various ideas on healthcare, college tuition plans, climate change strategies,
787680	792800	campaign finance laws, financial regulations, income inequality strategies, and plenty of other
792800	797040	ideas. I'm not sure how someone could think that the Democrats aren't trying to offer anything new
797040	801520	or different, but I know why Tim hasn't heard of any of this stuff. Only seven candidates at the
801520	805600	stage last night. Eh, they go on and name it. I don't care. I didn't watch debate. Speaking
805600	809920	specifically to Bernie, though, Tim thinks it would have been a solid strategy to have supported
809920	814000	Trump's investigation into Biden. Look, if you're gonna ask me, I think Bernie should be,
814000	819120	what should be behind Trump on this one. Think about it. For one, politically, it gets Biden
819120	823280	out of the way. I don't think that's the right reason to do it. That's, you know, political
823280	828960	nonsense. Wow, there are so many reasons not to do this, such as it's wrong on the facts,
828960	833360	it harms your standing within the Democratic Party, and it gives ammo to Bernie's opposition
833360	837840	in the election, which would be pretty accurate when he's teaming up with Republicans to target
837840	843200	Democrats. Tim is also quick to support Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard's vote of present,
843200	848560	not citing for or against impeachment. But you may have noticed that Tulsi Gabbard voted present,
848560	852160	and man, I was on the airplane, but I wanted to give a standing ovation to this.
852160	856160	This is the best vote of anybody. Tulsi Gabbard's not running for reelection. She's running for
856160	861120	president. She has to be there for most Americans. This was a move that annoyed both the left and the
861120	866400	right, but he sees it as the right move to make. His undying support of Gabbard, often complimenting
866400	872240	her political skills, is betrayed by the fact that she polls at under 2% in the Democratic primary.
872240	877040	I'm sure Tim would blame the DNC or the media, but Bernie Sanders faces similar challenges,
877040	880880	and he's managed to be one of the frontrunners. That's because people actually like him and his
880880	886880	policies, and based on a recent poll, not many people like Tulsi. But hey, this deeply unpopular
886880	891840	Democrat is an example of someone doing it right in Tim's eyes, so that's the sort of support one
891840	897280	would get for following Tim's strategies on how to run a successful campaign. I believe all these
897280	902880	suggestions from Tim Pool reveal two things. The first is that Tim is genuine. This could be
902880	907840	portrayed as him providing his bona fides to his right-wing audience as being ostensibly someone
907840	912800	on the left, but the reactions and comments tend to be disinterested on how to repair the left and
912800	917440	more interested in destroying it. I think he genuinely believes that these suggestions will
917440	921600	write the Democratic Party and let it have a brighter future in American politics. The second
921600	927360	thing these suggestions reveal is that Tim Pool is completely clueless when it comes to politics.
927360	931600	His ideas betray an appalling ignorance on political maneuvering and public sentiment.
931600	936400	It pretends the Democratic base is non-existent or not worth considering, and it praises strategies
936400	942000	that have been proven to fail. Tim just doesn't know what he's talking about here. Before leaving
942000	946560	his impeachment discussion, I'll highlight one more clip. Here's Tim talking about Donald Trump's
946560	952320	political leanings. Donald Trump, in reality, for those that are actually tracking politics,
952320	957920	is a moderate. He really is. They want to claim he's far right now. Trump's a New York Democrat.
957920	961440	I think the only reason he ran as a Republican is because Democrats would never elect a billionaire.
961440	965360	I don't know how someone could possibly believe this. The man who spent his administration by
965360	969600	trying to undo everything done by President Obama, from the Iran deal to the Paris Climate
969600	974240	Accord to the Affordable Care Act, the man who pushed tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans,
974240	979120	and the man who is appointing conservative judges across the country, is a New York Democrat.
979120	984000	And that's a narrative that, if you can convince someone of, you can convince them of anything.
984000	990160	Donald Trump is supposedly a moderate. So what, in Tim's mind, would a real conservative look like?
995360	1002560	Recently, Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks announced a run for Congress in California. Although well
1002560	1007680	known for being on the left, a number of spurious articles attacking him appeared in the supposedly
1007680	1013520	left-wing mainstream media. Tim commented on this in his video titled, The Young Turks Cenk Uygur is
1013520	1019440	getting destroyed by establishment over his animal love endorsement. Now, I really want to stress the
1019440	1024400	title here. Tim gets very angry about misleading headlines, but what does this one suggest? The
1024400	1029360	media is a tanking Cenk, yes, but it's only vaguely hinted at being based on falsehood by
1029360	1034320	the quotation marks around animal love. And the quotation marks are there because Tim is just
1034320	1039840	afraid YouTube will censor him if he uses a forbidden word. This is because YouTube will
1039840	1045520	shut down videos, they'll demonetize videos, and I can not use certain words to explain certain
1045520	1050000	ideas. I'm sure Tim would say, well, if someone clicked the video, they'd get the full story,
1050000	1054080	and then they would walk away realizing that he's not saying it's true. He's actually saying
1054080	1060800	the opposite. First of all, the viral clip is out of context. I refuse. I don't care if it's
1060800	1066000	if it's Cenk Uygur. I don't care if it's Nick Fuentes. You take an out of context clip, and I
1066000	1070800	can't tell what it is. I'm going to tell you the GTFO, period. Pretty straightforward. Tim clears
1070800	1075760	things up. Anyone who'd watch his video would understand that this was about defending Cenk
1075760	1081280	about the claim, not advancing it. But if we look under the comments of this video, we'll see that
1081280	1086640	his clarifications haven't really affected a large number of viewers. Comment after comment
1086640	1091520	about Cenk wanting to have sex with animals, I'd be a little worried if I made a video supposedly
1091520	1097200	to defend someone, only to find everyone repeating the exact charge that I was trying to debunk.
1097200	1101360	People don't really watch Tim's videos for his analysis, but to have their narratives be
1101360	1107120	confirmed. In this case, it's a narrative about someone on the left being some sort of weird
1107120	1111680	deviant. It also might not have helped things if Tim had not spent so much time complaining
1111680	1115760	that Cenk yelled at him one time and that Tim doesn't like that he's running for office.
1115760	1120960	That's what most of the video is actually about. And in the video titled, conservative memes are
1120960	1127680	being censored because fact checkers think leftist media is the default. We get more on Tim's
1127680	1133120	feelings about the left-wing hypocrisy in the media. Newsguard, which is apparently left-wing,
1133200	1138720	had the gall to criticize The Daily Wire, which is a news outlet run by everyone's favorite Ben
1138720	1144480	Shapiro. They say that, right here, does not repeatedly publish false content. Thumbs up.
1144480	1149440	It's got a green check mark. Okay, thank you, thank you, thank you, Newsguard, for letting me know
1149440	1154320	that there are severe issues with Daily Wire, but at least they're not publishing false content,
1154320	1162320	right? Actually, they say this, credibility. However, The Daily Wire frequently publishes
1162320	1168320	false and misleading information. Okay, hold on. You told me they don't do that. And then,
1168320	1173440	in your own content about it, you say they do do that. I got a contradiction here.
1173440	1180320	Newsguard has made a factual error. I'm sorry. Got him. Now, a clever person here might go on
1180320	1185520	to read the very lengthy 31 paragraphs detailing all the times The Daily Wire misrepresented a
1185520	1190560	story, but no, that's not what Tim is here to do. He's here to talk about the little summary
1190560	1196160	graphic at the top, not matching the more detailed breakdown at the bottom, while specifically this
1196160	1201600	sentence here. Tim calls this inconsistency a factual error, but the error here appears to
1201600	1206160	be that Newsguard isn't being hard enough on The Daily Wire in its summary graphic. And you know,
1206160	1212160	I think we have to give it to Tim this time. Newsguard is just too soft on right-wing news websites.
1212160	1217600	I'm not sure how being too soft on a right-wing news outlet proves that the fact checkers have
1217600	1222640	a left-wing bias, though. Kind of the opposite, actually. Better luck next time, Tim. But my
1222640	1228480	favorite part of this video is when Tim starts going off on Buzzfeed News. Let's see how angry he gets.
1247600	1257760	Tim, though, thinks Buzzfeed News was running this story as something to laugh at and that
1257760	1271440	they're all secretly racist. You know what's interesting, though? The Buzzfeed News article
1271440	1276080	actually never mentions the race of either of the two men, and it doesn't publish pictures of them
1276080	1281120	either. So how does Tim know they're black? I didn't just want to accuse Tim of making a
1281120	1285360	racist assumption here, so I took the extra step of digging up the original video on this story
1285360	1291520	from November 6th, 2019 titled, Buzzfeed wrote a fake headline about two black men fighting to death
1291520	1296240	over chicken. So Buzzfeed News didn't mention race at all, but Tim puts it right in the headline.
1296240	1300880	That's an interesting choice. Tim's problem with this chicken sandwich story is that there was no
1300880	1306560	literal chicken sandwich in anyone's hands, but rather people were in line to buy said sandwich.
1307120	1313280	For context, this sandwich was making a much awaited return, and Buzzfeed News based its headline
1313280	1319200	on a statement from the police. Oh, as Tim argues, nowhere did they say they were fighting over a
1319200	1325280	sandwich. What the police said was that it was preliminary, they said it's preliminary, but
1325280	1329440	this was related to the release of a sandwich. Could it be that I don't know because of the
1329440	1332800	release of the sandwich, a guy was going to meet up with another guy at the location and they
1332800	1336320	weren't going to get the sandwich? The sandwich has nothing to do with it. It seems Tim got more
1336320	1341280	information about this new story from an article in the Daily Mail which posted lots of pictures.
1341280	1346400	There's a comment from the cousin of the stabbed man clearly upset that his cousin's death is being
1346400	1350800	used to market a chicken sandwich. Tim seems to think this proves his point that the murder had
1350800	1356400	nothing to do with the sandwich though. Then Tim starts to get really worked up. This is when they
1356480	1361840	cover the violence. This is when they cover the violence that when I was growing up in Chicago,
1361840	1366320	this is the kind of stuff we deal with. And now you've got this dude's family saying they weren't
1366320	1370400	fighting over a chicken sandwich man, but that's the funny story that Buzzfeed gets to report,
1370400	1375760	isn't it? These people are hypocrites and they're disgusting. You know, I never really claimed to
1375760	1381360	be a media expert, at least not the way Tim does. I'm just curious, does Buzzfeed News ever dare to
1381360	1387120	talk about the violence in Chicago? These articles are all from 2019 and they seem to suggest that,
1387120	1391920	yes, in fact, they do. Lots of important stories are there. If Tim thinks this isn't enough,
1391920	1395600	then I have some great news for him. He has a platform where he can cover all of these stories
1395600	1400160	and more and can really put a spotlight on the violence problem in Chicago he apparently cares
1400160	1405600	about a lot. For some reason, he chooses not to. In the interest of fairness, Tim's two primary
1405600	1410800	channels actually did cover a very specific crime in Chicago quite extensively in 2019.
1410800	1417120	One that did also involve issues of race and it so inspired Tim that he made 12 videos alone on
1417120	1422720	the subject and that's the Jussie Smollett staged hate crime. So when Tim points his finger at
1422720	1427760	Buzzfeed News for being racist and ignoring violence in Chicago, when Tim's recent work in
1427760	1433600	said field is to obsessively discuss a staged hate crime, he can spare me the indignation. Maybe he
1433600	1438000	should take a look at the sort of stories he propagates instead of lying about the people who
1438000	1443600	are doing the very thing he accuses them of not doing. Oh, and going back briefly to the Popeyes
1443600	1448160	story, Tim wanted to give credit to the Daily Mail for doing a better job covering the story.
1448160	1452560	Funny how Tim doesn't get upset about the Daily Mail saying it was over a chicken sandwich, huh?
1452560	1457760	Now let's talk about how much Tim cares about the media. In the artfully titled video,
1457760	1464720	California has nuked leftist media from orbit. Hundreds of writers are being fired under new law.
1464720	1468800	Tim describes how a new law was passed in California that puts a limit on how much
1468800	1472960	work employers can purchase from freelancers without making them full-time employees.
1473920	1478400	Tim sums up the problem for us like this. Are these leftists saying, hey,
1479680	1483520	companies aren't paying their employees enough and they keep hiring freelancers?
1484320	1489680	Got an idea. Let's make it so they can't hire freelancers more than 35 times per year.
1490400	1495440	That way, they'll be forced to hire the freelancers, right? It all makes sense.
1495440	1500960	This is a progressive victory, they say. In reality, it's very different. In reality,
1500960	1505760	they say, well, we can't hire all these people. Just fire all these people. We'll save money
1505760	1511520	and we'll figure it out somewhere else. Or better yet, they're going to hire freelancers in different
1511520	1515200	states. You know what's going to happen to these people who don't have work anymore?
1515200	1519040	They're not going to be able to pay their rent. Then they're going to end up in a homeless camp
1519120	1523920	and it's going to be your fault. This video is in the context of talking about a new story where
1523920	1529280	Fox eliminated 200 jobs right before the holiday season, no less. Many of these cuts are coming
1529280	1534480	from SB Nation, a blogging network owned by Vox. Tim even reads a small excerpt in an official
1534480	1539120	statement from SB Nation. This is a bittersweet note of thanks to our California independent
1539120	1543840	contractors, John Ness. Executive director of SB Nation wrote in a post on Monday,
1543840	1550080	in 2020, we will move California's team blogs from our established system with hundreds of
1550080	1554720	contractors to a new one run by a team of new SB Nation employees. You know what they literally
1554720	1561840	said? We need these jobs filled. If you're in California, you're fired. We're going to rehire
1561840	1566080	because the jobs aren't going anywhere, other people. Think about that for a second. This is
1566080	1570720	not a case of being told your company can't support you. I'm sorry, we have to let you go.
1570720	1575440	It's not a case of Vox going out of business. It's literally Vox saying, you guys passed the law.
1576000	1580560	I got to fire you, but this dude over here in Arizona, he's all good. He's hired. He gets your
1580560	1585920	job now. What would happen if we clicked on that link and read the full statement? We'd find this
1585920	1591280	telling paragraph. To comply with this new law, we will not be replacing California contractors
1591280	1596800	with contractors from other states. Rather, we're encouraging any contractors interested in one of
1596800	1602080	our newly created full-time or part-time employee positions to apply. We know many of our California
1602080	1606400	contractors already have other full-time jobs and may not have the bandwidth to apply, but we hope
1606400	1612800	to see many of them join us as employees. So SB Nation is getting rid of its freelance positions
1612800	1617760	and replacing them with full-time and part-time jobs. Although I do feel for the freelancers who
1617760	1621280	have full-time jobs and we're just doing this freelancing to make a little extra income.
1621840	1628320	If there are examples of people being unfairly hurt by this law, this story isn't it. Tim tries
1628320	1632720	to portray it as people being cast out in the streets with no source of income and now they're
1632720	1636800	going to be struggling living in homeless camps because they can't pay their bills, saying that
1636800	1641680	all these jobs are going out of state when in fact they aren't. They're being replaced by full-time
1641680	1647520	positions, which is sort of how the law is supposed to work because full-time positions
1647600	1652800	are better than freelance ones. And this is Tim all over. He finds these stories that he thinks
1652800	1658400	reinforces narratives, in this case the leftist media championing socialist policies that destroy
1658400	1662480	jobs, but he doesn't check the facts well enough to make sure they don't say the exact opposite.
1662480	1666880	He finds enough information to confirm his narrative of leftist media pushing the destructive
1666880	1672240	agenda and then he moves on, confident that his audience won't do the basics to fact check him.
1672240	1676640	There's one criticism I know I'm going to get, so I want to address it right here.
1677280	1681760	I've seen him use this defense on Twitter before, saying watch all my videos before you criticize
1681760	1687760	me, which is frankly preposterous. When there are hundreds of hours, no one can possibly do this.
1688320	1694320	The point of this response is to show you all what it's like to watch a single week of his content.
1694320	1698960	If I was a person unfamiliar with Tim Poole and decided to give his content a try for a week,
1698960	1703760	what would I find? What would I see? These are the results of that.
1729840	1733120	Q&A. I'll have a community post asking for more questions in the future,
1733120	1737440	so if you've got any questions for me, hold on to them, and we'll do a big QA video.
1737440	1740000	That'll be fun. Like, comment, subscribe, hit the bell.
