1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
Beginning is a right-wing news outlet in 2015, and I use the term news very loosely here.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,760
In 2021, The Daily Wire took its first steps into the world of entertainment, with the

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,480
release of Run, Hide, Fight, a movie that answers the question, what if Die Hard took

4
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,000
place at a school shooting?

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,760
I already went over that movie, including its very sordid history, in another video.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,280
It was an important milestone for the outlet, as it moved them away from news coverage that

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,440
was heavily biased in favor of the right, towards entertainment that was, supposedly,

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,040
devoid of any kind of political agenda.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,860
Since then, The Daily Wire has expanded its offerings to four movies on its streaming

10
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:39,640
service, including one starring Gina Carano called Terror on the Prairie.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,560
This is the first movie Carano has appeared in since being fired off The Mandalorian by

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,080
Disney for her social media activity.

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,360
In addition to movies, The Daily Wire's streaming service, recently renamed Daily

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,520
Wire Plus, has been rapidly expanding its catalog, moving into kids' shows, documentaries,

15
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,280
sports podcasts, and daytime chat shows.

16
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,200
What we're seeing is a well-financed operation that is attempting to create a media landscape

17
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,880
that will, supposedly, compete with mainstream entertainment.

18
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:07,120
But I don't think that tells us the whole story.

19
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,000
I'm sure they'd love to be making more money than Disney, but they must know how incredibly

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,080
unlikely that is.

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,120
Instead, I think something else is being built here.

22
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,040
But before we dig into that, we first need to take a trip to the movies.

23
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,920
When I made that video about Run, Hide, Fight, I considered making reviews for all of the

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,240
Daily Wire movies.

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,760
And that was the plan until I watched them.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:31,400
And I realized that, while that first movie had an absolutely bonkers premise, the rest

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,880
would be far less provocative and about just as boring.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,680
Run, Hide, Fight was produced by Bonfire Legend, and of the three movies that followed the

29
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,720
school shooter one, two of them were produced by Bonfire Legend.

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,320
Formerly known as Sin Estate, they changed their name after one of their producers was

31
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,360
charged with allegedly sexually assaulting an underage girl.

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,080
They were a small production company operating out of Texas that would make low-budget movies,

33
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,620
and as we go through some of these movies they bay with the Daily Wire, you'll likely

34
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,640
not be shocked to find out you haven't heard of any of them, and we'll likely forget them

35
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,760
soon after.

36
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,000
Della Sonnier, who founded Bonfire Legend, said in an email to IndieWire,

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,240
Bonfire Legend reflects the spirit of my firebrand of moviemaking and my personal vendetta against

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,620
disingenuous morality amidst a deeply polarized body politic.

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,240
The first major effort between Bonfire Legend and the Daily Wire was shut in.

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:24,440
Starring Rainy Qualey, J. Carlwitz, and Vincent Gallo.

41
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,600
It's about a recovering addict, Jessica, who is trying to escape the influence of the

42
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,640
father of her children, Rob, and his creepy friend Sammy.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,140
The movie has a surprisingly decent first two acts, offering some pretty good tension,

44
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,300
but ultimately falls apart in the third act with some weak action sequences and a slightly

45
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,960
awkward religious message.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,680
Although as a thriller it didn't amount to anything too memorable, its production

47
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,520
does tell a more interesting story.

48
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,520
The script for shut in was originally bought by New Line Cinema, and at one point Jason

49
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,520
Bateman was even attached to direct.

50
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:58,880
But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it languished in development limbo long enough for the deal

51
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
to fall through.

52
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,040
Della Sonnier, who had been shopping a script around, brought it to the Daily Wire.

53
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,680
The script was written by Melanie Toast.

54
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:10,240
This script was the first one she ever sold, and while it had been optioned by New Line

55
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,660
Cinema was facing a lot of changes.

56
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:17,060
When it was brought over to Daily Wire though, it was left untouched so that the movie produced

57
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:19,100
was as it was written on the page.

58
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,940
While that was nice of them to do, the fact that this was the first screenplay Toast had

59
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,420
ever sold makes me think it might have benefited from some input from others, especially when

60
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,140
you look at Final Product.

61
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,560
It had some good ideas that just didn't come together in the final release.

62
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,820
And while I personally wasn't overwhelmed by the movie, I do want to acknowledge that

63
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,600
the writer, Melanie Toast, had no intention of working with the Daily Wire.

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,860
In a tweet from Twitter user avishaiwineburger, he wrote about shut in,

65
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,340
having the rights to your script get tied up with these guys without your knowing what

66
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:51,260
they are, and then they sell it as an exclusive on an alt-right site.

67
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:54,380
Again, unless you asked for this, you didn't ask for this.

68
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,960
What a nightmare.

69
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,660
Toast replied with a simple, I didn't.

70
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:03,620
Happily for her, she now has a deal with Paramount working on a horror film titled Rabbit Rabbit

71
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Rabbit.

72
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,860
I'm sure her work will keep getting better and I do wish her all the best.

73
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,940
Other people were involved with this production though, not so much.

74
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:14,900
In particular, Vincent Gallo, with shut in being his first appearance in a movie in

75
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,300
nine years.

76
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:22,140
Gallo first achieved some notoriety in 1998 with his movie Buffalo 66, making him something

77
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,760
of an indie darling.

78
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,500
After that though, he really struggled to find any sort of success, and over the years

79
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,060
has gotten into some trouble because of his behavior.

80
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,260
The Daily Wire characterized him saying,

81
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:37,020
"...his brash persona rubbed plenty of people the wrong way in La La Land.

82
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,660
Plus he's a loud and proud Republican unwilling to play by Hollywood's rules."

83
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,540
Let's just get a quick sample of that brash persona.

84
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,380
Gallo has made a distinct impression with his online merch store where he sells one-off

85
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:55,980
t-shirts for $666, with Sogans such as F*** Black Lives Matter, and one with a picture

86
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,020
of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a homophobic slur printed on it.

87
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,620
He also sells his sperm for $1 million.

88
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,080
Here's an excerpt from that section.

89
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,760
This is kind of a long excerpt, but it's pretty wild, so I feel as though I have to

90
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,760
read the whole thing.

91
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,480
Mr. Gallo maintains the right to refuse sale of his sperm to those of extremely dark complexions.

92
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:22,200
Though a fan of Franco Harris, Derek Jeter, Lenny Kravitz, and Lena Horne, Mr. Gallo does

93
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,320
not want to be part of that type of integration.

94
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,840
In fact, for the next 30 days, he is offering a $50,000 discount to any potential female

95
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,800
purchaser who can prove she has naturally blonde hair and blue eyes.

96
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,200
Anyone who can prove a direct family fling to any of the German soldiers of the mid-century

97
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,280
will also receive this discount.

98
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,360
Under the laws of the Jewish faith, a Jewish mother would qualify a baby to be deemed a

99
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,280
member of the Jewish religion.

100
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,760
This would be added incentive for Mr. Gallo to sell his sperm to a Jew mother, his reasoning

101
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,600
being that the slim chance that his child moved into the profession of motion picture

102
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,400
acting or become a musical performer, this connection to the Jewish faith would guarantee

103
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,240
his offspring a better chance at good reviews and maybe even a prize at the Sundance Film

104
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,840
Festival or an Oscar.

105
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,440
According to Sornier, this is some kind of satire.

106
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
I'm not entirely sure what it is, it's satirizing though.

107
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,840
In 2020, Gallo made a post on Instagram to show his support for Donald Trump and included

108
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,280
in the message he wrote,

109
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,640
Granting women the right to vote was a mistake, and that mistake is clearer now than ever

110
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,640
before.

111
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,840
If this is all meant as some sort of elaborate performance, it's a bit strange to think

112
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:36,080
that Gallo has basically burnt his career to the ground for the sake of these outbursts.

113
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,340
And in the case of The Daily Wire, the joke seems to be partially lost on them.

114
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:45,240
Or perhaps these reasons are simply emblematic of why no one wants to work with this guy,

115
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:49,960
aside from those who at least partially share some of these opinions.

116
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,060
Of course it should also be said if The Daily Wire is willing to work with a production

117
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:57,780
company that turned a blind eye to a sexual predator who was only stopped after allegedly

118
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,220
assaulting an underage girl, hiring a washed-up actor who is messed up views on gender and

119
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,000
race might not seem so extreme.

120
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,940
After Shut In, the next movie released by The Daily Wire was The Hyperions starring

121
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,380
Carrie Ellis.

122
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:14,260
This is similar to Run, Hide, Fight in that it was produced well before The Daily Wire

123
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,340
had any hand in the creative process, and they're only acting as the movie's distributor.

124
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:23,400
The movie took a long and complicated route going through multiple entities before ending

125
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,440
up on the streaming platform, but that story isn't so interesting.

126
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,100
So to get straight to the point, it had been languishing for three years before finally

127
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,260
getting released, and no one involved in this production had any idea it would end up on

128
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,540
The Daily Wire.

129
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,340
So we don't have to hate Carrie Ellis, and we can still celebrate him dunking on Ted

130
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Cruz.

131
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:45,780
Sadly, the movie doesn't quite come together in what seemed, at first, like a thoughtful

132
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,980
attempt to address Disney's commodification of superheroes.

133
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:53,300
The style owes a lot to Wes Anderson, but without the charm or authenticity.

134
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:56,940
Ultimately, it's just not a very captivating movie.

135
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:00,420
At least there were no creepy sex pests working on this one though.

136
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,780
Which finally brings us to the latest movie from The Daily Wire, the Gina Carano-led Terror

137
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,300
on the Prairie.

138
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,280
Back in 2020, while working on The Mandalorian, Carano made a series of tweets comparing

139
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,780
being a conservative to being Jewish in Nazi Germany amidst pushing conspiracy theories

140
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,620
of voter fraud along with other talking points you would see in more conspiracy-minded

141
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,400
right-wing media outlets.

142
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:26,100
So when her behavior led Carano to being fired off The Mandalorian, she rebounded very quickly

143
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,420
signing a deal with The Daily Wire.

144
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,020
If you'd like to learn more about the situation, Council of Geeks has a good video going over

145
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,500
the controversy that details how Gina Carano wasn't fired because she expressed the wrong

146
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,860
ideology, but because her stirring up controversy made Disney think she might affect how profitable

147
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,860
their show would be.

148
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:46,980
Regardless of what the Daily Wire crew tell you, it's not being woke these corporations

149
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:50,940
care about, it's making money, and Gina Carano was fired because her behavior might

150
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,020
affect Disney's bottom line.

151
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:56,540
Although the first movie Carano was supposed to work on was titled White Knuckle, about

152
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,980
a woman who was targeted by a serial killer trucker, this was supposedly put on hold because

153
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,940
of COVID requirements for filming.

154
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:07,340
So instead, The Western, Terror on the Prairie, which was filmed in Montana, became the first

155
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,820
movie Carano would star in for The Daily Wire.

156
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,700
According to producer Dallas Sonnier, it was the looming federal vaccine mandates that

157
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,700
made him put White Knuckle on hold.

158
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,780
Why a federal mandate wouldn't also apply to Montana, which last I checked was still

159
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:23,180
in the United States, wasn't explained.

160
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:26,340
Let's actually go into some detail about the content of this movie.

161
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:31,060
Terror on the Prairie is about Hattie, the wife of a struggling farmer who has to defend

162
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:35,940
herself and her two children from four men while her husband is in town looking for work.

163
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:38,860
It's a siege of a small wooden cabin in the wilderness.

164
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:43,740
Eventually, the good characters end up happily and the bad unhappily because, as Oscar Wilde

165
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,860
once wrote, that is what fiction means.

166
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,740
Like Run, Hide, Fight, and Shut In, this movie resists interpretation as it exists largely

167
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,340
to service action sequences and tension.

168
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,740
But that doesn't mean it isn't saying anything.

169
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:00,460
Taking place shortly after the Civil War, we find out that Hattie's husband Jeb, played

170
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:04,980
by UFC fighter Donald Cerrone, was a former Confederate soldier who apparently turned

171
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,540
on his commanding officer.

172
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,100
When he and some of his fellow soldiers tried to murder their captain, they ended up killing

173
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,140
his daughter instead, leading the captain, played by Nick Cersei, to hunt them all down.

174
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:18,500
Which is how these four men ended up outside his Montana home.

175
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:23,340
The pride of Jeb and Hattie's son, of being an American, is contrasted with Jeb's shame

176
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:28,020
being a former Confederate, introduces an interesting tension in a post-Civil War America,

177
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:30,660
where the losing side has to reckon with their actions.

178
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:34,980
Whether it's shame for fighting on the wrong side or the humiliation for having lost, Jeb

179
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,020
still has to look his son in the eye knowing that he once fought against what his son holds

180
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,740
up as pure and good.

181
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,500
And Jeb's whole project to move to Montana further cements the westward expansion of

182
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,660
the United States.

183
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:50,500
So in addition to that shame or humiliation, Jeb is now in service to the state he once

184
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,500
fought against.

185
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:57,040
It's a thorough emasculation in a time and genre where a rugged masculinity would be

186
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,980
highly valued.

187
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:02,700
Had this movie been about Jeb, I think it might have been more interesting.

188
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:07,260
But instead we focus on Hattie, a character who doesn't seem to be quite as interesting

189
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,380
aside from the fact that she seems to come from a wealthy family and has given it up

190
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:14,200
to run off with Jeb to Montana.

191
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,580
She is the housewife who holds the family together while her husband is off trying to

192
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,940
make something of himself.

193
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,340
And it could have been an interesting look at the role women played in the 19th century

194
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,700
and the heavy burden of maintaining a household.

195
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,940
But by exploring that through a violent confrontation, it could struggle in survival in the west

196
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:32,620
with masculine signifiers, like fighting off bandits.

197
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:37,180
There is an irony here that I almost agree with the Daily Wire crew who generally seem

198
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,260
to get upset at female characters who star in action movies, especially those who adopt

199
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:56,460
male traits as some form of female empowerment.

200
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,460
The difference between us is that the action movie dynamic isn't interesting to me because

201
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,400
it traps displays of strength in a movie behind very old masculine-coated tropes.

202
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,300
Instead of letting female and male characters alike find other ways of demonstrating their

203
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,300
inner strength.

204
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:14,460
The only time we see Hattie making an impact where she isn't wielding a gun or in some

205
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:18,860
way fighting off bad guys is early on when we see her treat an indigenous character's

206
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:21,900
injuries, an experience that seems to rattle her.

207
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,940
Which is strange because in 50 minutes she'll be quite competently setting up barricades

208
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,580
and smashing windows to fight off the captain and his goons.

209
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:33,340
Still, her ability to treat someone medically is an interesting and thoughtful way of showing

210
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,740
how important and crucial a character like her is in this kind of environment.

211
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:42,620
And the fact that these are the only indigenous characters we see in the movie is also interesting.

212
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:46,380
This scene can be seen as a whitewashing of sort of the westward expansion of the United

213
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:50,940
States, doing a little bit to help the indigenous populations and then having their own wacky

214
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,860
adventures on land that was recently stolen.

215
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,380
Back to those action scenes that make up the bulk of the movie though, it's strange that

216
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,860
they're not scarier for Hattie.

217
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,220
Perhaps they seem scarier written down, but they don't really come across on camera.

218
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,020
That's probably because one of the biggest issues this movie has is that Gina Carano

219
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,060
just doesn't seem up to the task of leading the film.

220
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:15,260
I'm not deeply familiar with her acting history, so I don't know how this compares to her

221
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,100
previous work too much, but this performance on Terror on the Prairie is flat and lifeless.

222
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:24,180
She has the steely attitude of an action hero in the context of a western thriller.

223
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,540
As an example of how little she seems to be trying, consider the fact that Hattie is supposed

224
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:31,060
to be from Missouri and should have an accent.

225
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:49,500
It really seems that if Gina Carano was not going to do an accent for this movie, they

226
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,420
perhaps should have just dropped that line entirely.

227
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:56,860
Speaking of bad acting, the scenes between Carano and Cerrone are an absolute struggle

228
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,860
to watch.

229
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,580
Nick Cersei does an okay job as the captain, but otherwise the acting in this movie really

230
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:18,780
takes it down some.

231
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,260
It's bad enough to be distracting and undermined what I suspect is a movie about the role women

232
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:27,460
in the West had in holding households together, albeit awkwardly presented through the language

233
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,460
of violence.

234
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,860
It might be easy enough to ignore the clumsy messaging of this movie if the action were

235
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,780
interesting or exciting, but much of it is slow and clumsy.

236
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:40,580
Since it's the 19th century, we see a lot of people running around from not very far

237
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,700
distances as their guns struggle to hit anything.

238
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:47,300
The captain and his gang try a few schemes to get Hattie and her kids out of the house,

239
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:51,020
with varying degrees of failure, and we see our heroes eventually triumph while ignoring

240
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,020
their gunshot wounds.

241
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,380
In other words, basic action movie cliches.

242
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,660
It's a real shame we couldn't get a better female-led Western out of this thing, because

243
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,380
that is one of the few unique things Terror on the Prairie brings to the table.

244
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:06,860
Of the many, many Westerns produced in the last century, a minuscule number of them feature

245
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:07,860
female leads.

246
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,220
Ahead of this movie, I tried watching the few I could find, and it was a challenge just

247
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,060
to locate any female-led Westerns.

248
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:19,700
Some of the classics include Annie Get Your Gun and Calamity Jane, both musicals respectively

249
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,060
about Annie Oakley and Calamity Jane, who were both popular acts from the Buffalo Bill

250
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:27,340
traveling Western show from the early half of the 20th century.

251
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,820
There is also Annie Colder, starring Raquel Welch, about a woman who hunts down some outlaws

252
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,820
who wronged her.

253
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:36,980
In the 90s, there was The Quick and the Dead, starring Sharon Stone, about a female gunfighter,

254
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:40,820
and the most recent female-led Western I could find was Meeks Cut-Off, which, to be honest,

255
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:44,700
felt a little more like an ensemble piece than having a strong female lead.

256
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,780
Although it was certainly the best of the movies I watched.

257
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,740
Terror on the Prairie owes something to Annie Colder, as it has a similar premise, although

258
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:56,460
when it comes to Annie Colder, that movie is all over the place with its tone.

259
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,060
But through that madness, I still see Annie as a more believable character, as her journey

260
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,100
in this movie takes her from being a housewife to becoming a gunfighter, driven by her vendetta.

261
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,300
It's an old Western cliché, but it makes more sense than Terror on the Prayer's Hattie,

262
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:14,100
who somehow is able to fight off a siege at her farmhouse.

263
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,020
There's no development or growth.

264
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,700
Just the bad guy shows up, she fights them, and eventually, through a few twists of fate,

265
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
she wins.

266
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,580
It's not much of an arc.

267
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,760
Annie Get Your Gun and Calamity Jane both being musicals means they center on love stories,

268
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,620
but both tell fun stories about women who are underestimated by them and around them,

269
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,020
gradually building respect amongst their peers.

270
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:37,780
Calamity Jane in particular says a lot of interesting things about gender roles, with

271
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,740
people often treating Jane like a man.

272
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:44,080
Her relationship with Wild Bill Hickok is built on a strong mutual respect, though romance

273
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,960
and feelings between the two can only be reciprocated when Bill finally sees Jane fit

274
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,120
into a more traditional gender presentation.

275
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,760
There's even a scene where a male actor is forced to pretend as though he were a woman.

276
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,960
In other words, this movie is making a lot of claims on how superficial gender roles

277
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,160
are, even in the very sharply defined world of the Western.

278
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Terror on the Prairie could be implicitly making many of the same claims, but it's

279
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:11,760
so enraptured with its violence and intestinity that it never really pauses to explore these

280
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,760
questions.

281
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:16,480
It's read as an inversion in the characters of Hattie and Jeb, but everything else is

282
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,880
such a standard Western cliché that it struggles to say anything of substance, even when its

283
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
very premise is a direct challenge to gender roles in Western movies.

284
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,480
It makes the whole thing feel like a wasted opportunity.

285
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,920
So in short, I didn't like this movie very much.

286
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,200
I give it a 2.34 out of 12.

287
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,960
If you're wondering where Terror on the Prairie ranks amongst the female-led Westerns I've

288
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,760
seen, I'd place it roughly here, slightly below Handy Calder.

289
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,320
Maybe it seems like being the worst is a harsh criticism, but when there are so few

290
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,280
of these to begin with, it's actually not saying that much at all.

291
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,540
I just didn't like it.

292
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,000
The Daily Wire likes to characterize its movie and productions as being politically neutral.

293
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,240
That is, they want to make movies for everyone, not just a conservative audience, and they're

294
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,840
willing to work with anyone regardless of their politics.

295
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,200
And while I'm sure they would accept any celebrity who would help raise the profile

296
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,440
of their productions, they are quite obviously building a very conservative group of creative

297
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,360
people to work for them and are deliberately targeting a conservative audience.

298
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:24,320
Here's The Daily Wire's co-founder Jeremy Boring lying through his teeth.

299
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,320
As I showed you a few moments ago, Gina Carano's politics are not a mystery.

300
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,600
She is obviously and clearly conservative.

301
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,020
For Jeremy Boring to say this, in 2022, must be dishonesty.

302
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,540
She's not sure how far right she is, but she's clearly somewhere on the right.

303
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,260
Ahead of Terror on the Prairie's premiere, Dallas Sonnier, who was a producer on the

304
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,380
movie, posted on Instagram to thank his supporters who,

305
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,800
"...keep us motivated as we fight the commies for the right to live our lives freely and

306
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,580
watch our movies without garbage indoctrinations."

307
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,700
And when the crew took a photo in production, they posed with a giant red flag that read,

308
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,540
Let's Go, Brandon.

309
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,540
I wonder if that person regrets buying such a big memento for a dead meme mocking Joe

310
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,860
Biden.

311
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,940
Nick Cersei, who played the captain on Terror on the Prairie, is an outspoken conservative,

312
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,100
never letting a tired meme go to waste.

313
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:17,620
He joked on Twitter that while shooting Terror on the Prairie, he named his horse Brandon.

314
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:20,980
So he could say, Let's Go, Brandon, while riding.

315
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:24,460
For all the talk about keeping politics out of movies and how little they care about the

316
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,360
politics of the creative people they work with, the actual productions of these movies

317
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,540
have a distinctly right-wing flair to them.

318
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:33,780
It may just be that no one wants to work with The Daily Wire because they spread white-wing

319
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,140
propaganda, or it could also be that no one wants to work with them because their movies

320
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:42,460
are on a streaming service with a subscriber base less than 1% of Netflix or Disney+.

321
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,260
But still, they are getting talent to sign up with them, and there must be a reason.

322
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:49,940
And I think we got a pretty good indication why at the red carpet premiere for Terror

323
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,420
on the Prairie.

324
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,500
Here's Gina Carano being interviewed as to why she chose to work with The Daily Wire.

325
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,620
Why was it so important for you to work with The Daily Wire?

326
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,180
I'm sure you had tons of people knocking down your door.

327
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,180
Why'd you pick The Daily Wire?

328
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:06,860
Well, there was a big massive company that fired me.

329
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
I didn't hear about that.

330
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:08,860
It was a big deal.

331
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,860
They didn't want to work with me, which made the rest of the industry not want to work with

332
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,860
me.

333
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,860
And then all of a sudden, Daily Wire popped up and they were like, We want to work with

334
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:15,860
you.

335
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,020
And I was like, Wow, I want to work with you too.

336
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,460
And that's basically how it happened.

337
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,540
It's very cute that the interviewer tried to make it sound as though Gina Carano was

338
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:29,980
being highly sought after, and her response is that she actually didn't have many other

339
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:30,980
options.

340
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:34,900
Outside of her work with The Daily Wire, Carano is also set to appear in another movie, this

341
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,460
one titled My Son Hunter, which is about Hunter Biden.

342
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:43,100
In spite of the production photo of Hunter living a blessed life, this movie sounds like

343
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:47,020
it's capitalizing on the right wing obsession with Hunter Biden.

344
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:50,900
Gina Carano's options as an actress seem pretty limited.

345
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:55,020
Another familiar face at the red carpet premiere, and the only person you might have heard of

346
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:04,860
who is not currently on the Daily Wire's payroll, as far as I know, was Rob Schneider.

347
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:08,900
I got a bit of heat on Twitter saying Rob Schneider was the only celebrity not in the

348
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,820
movie to show up to this premiere.

349
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:16,140
And I want to once again sincerely apologize for using the term celebrity to describe Rob

350
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,140
Schneider.

351
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,140
I'll try to do better.

352
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:22,060
There are creative people who work on these movies who haven't had much mainstream success.

353
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,580
And considering how tough it is to make it in show business, it's understandable someone

354
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:29,060
taking whatever work might come their way, and hopefully some of them will move on to

355
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,580
bigger and better things.

356
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:34,580
But when it comes to these known quantities in Hollywood, it seems the only people who

357
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,060
want to do work with The Daily Wire are conservative celebrities who can't get a job anywhere

358
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,980
else or who aren't really quite on the A-list.

359
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,780
Using their shared ideology to get a quick payday for a series of movies that are forgotten

360
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:48,580
halfway through watching them.

361
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:52,740
After all the bravado of competing with Hollywood, so far The Daily Wire's attempt at making

362
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,660
movies has been a bit of a thud.

363
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,460
But feature films are only one part of a much larger enterprise that this right-wing outlet

364
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,420
is embarking on.

365
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:04,940
First off, not all of their movies are feature films.

366
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:09,580
While everyone is aware of Matt Walsh's abysmal documentary What is a Woman because

367
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:13,980
of the blanket advertising it saw here on YouTube back in June, The Daily Wire has also

368
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:19,700
made several other movies in that vein, including Choosing Death, The Legacy of Ro, China,

369
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,820
The Enemy Within, and Bouchie Unmasked.

370
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:27,500
Hilariously on the Daily Wire website, above this section it reads, The only agenda is

371
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,660
entertainment.

372
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:33,440
As if the upcoming movie from Candace Owens, called The Greatest Lie Ever Told, about George

373
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,980
Floyd and the rise of Black Lives Matter, is somehow going to be devoid of any agenda

374
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,300
or in any way be entertaining.

375
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,340
But The Daily Wire doesn't just stream bad movies and publish right-wing propaganda masquerade

376
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,340
in his news.

377
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,740
Of course, the major hosts of The Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, Matt Walsh, Andrew

378
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:54,180
Clavin, and Michael Knowles all have their own shows.

379
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:57,580
Although for some reason Candace Owens is the only one who doesn't get her full name

380
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
in the title.

381
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,540
They've also got several regular programs you've probably never heard of, such as

382
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:06,940
Ben Shapiro's Debunked, where he spends 15 minutes or less misreading science to explain

383
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:10,060
how climate change is no big deal or that God exists.

384
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:14,980
There's also Daily Wire Backstage, where Jeremy Boring assembles the bros to engage

385
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,160
in the classic manly pastimes of drinking scotch, smoking cigars, and crying about someone

386
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,940
being mean to them on Twitter.

387
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,420
And then there's Crane and Company, sports coverage that is supposedly not woke.

388
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:31,180
I've never quite figured out what this means, and looking at the descriptions of their programming,

389
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,860
it mostly seems like pretty standard stuff.

390
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,900
Like when they say the Toronto Maple Leafs are going to blow it in the playoffs, it's

391
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,700
what Leafs fans have known for decades.

392
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:42,580
The reason they might appeal to the right-wing Daily Wire audience is that part of their

393
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,060
sports coverage includes things like this.

394
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:50,020
For some context, this little tirade from Jake Crane comes after LeBron James criticized

395
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,940
the US government for not doing enough to free Brittany Greiner, who was arrested in

396
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,020
Russia in February of this year on drug charges, and she has been detained there for over five

397
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,020
months.

398
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,080
Now in most countries around the world, LeBron would have never had the chance to reach the

399
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,620
heights that he has.

400
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:10,180
But maybe it's time we the people start to push back a little bit on this diva, this

401
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:16,060
propaganda puppet for the CCP, this race hustler, and the same guy who told an innocent cop,

402
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,100
you're next.

403
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:21,140
Maybe we should trade LeBron for Brittany so he can start to form an appreciation for

404
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,880
the greatest country on earth.

405
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,660
This is what ESPN is apparently missing.

406
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:29,460
Long rant about how athletes don't love America enough.

407
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,780
Even if you want to step away from the screen, the Daily Wire is now publishing books, much

408
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:37,600
in the way their movies are courting conservatives who have talked themselves out of work.

409
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,020
Their book publishing wing is picking up books that were dropped by mainstream outlets.

410
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:46,140
For example, in April of 2021, Simon & Schuster decided not to publish a book by Sergeant

411
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,760
Jonathan Mattingly, who was one of the officers who fired shots during a narcotics raid that

412
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,140
killed Breonna Taylor.

413
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:57,020
It was published by the Daily Wire under the title, 12 Seconds in the Dark, a police officer's

414
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,580
first-hand account of the Breonna Taylor raid.

415
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,840
While they've published four books so far, none of them have cracked the New York Times

416
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,160
bestseller list.

417
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:07,920
I will tell the Daily Wire right now, though, that if they publish another Ben Shapiro novel,

418
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,560
I will make that book a bestseller.

419
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:15,320
On June 29, 2022, the Daily Wire made another announcement that they were expanding even

420
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,320
further.

421
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,360
To do this, they hosted Daily Wire Backstaged Live at the Ryman, which is a theater in Nashville,

422
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,640
this city where the Daily Wire currently operates out of.

423
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:28,880
The first hour and 50 minutes of this presentation is a long, drawn-out series of appearances

424
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,760
from many of the faces of the Daily Wire, featuring a lengthy version of their backstage

425
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,480
program live, this time including special guest Candace Owens.

426
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,600
You might have seen that clip of her online talking about how abortion wasn't happening

427
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,080
during the time of slavery.

428
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,520
Amy Schumer, same thing.

429
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,120
She came out and gave a statement about this is exactly what the slaveholders wanted.

430
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,640
And I was like, I would like a further explanation as to what you are talking about when you

431
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:56,480
make that statement, because there was there was no abortion happening when we had slaves.

432
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,920
What are you what are they saying?

433
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,280
Anyone with some knowledge of history knows that this simply isn't true.

434
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,040
Many forms of abortion have existed for thousands of years, and there were no laws regarding

435
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,080
abortion at all in the United States until 1821.

436
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,320
And it wasn't until the 1860s when abortion became illegal before quickening.

437
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,800
Quickening is when you can first feel kicking inside the womb, roughly 16 to 20 weeks into

438
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,000
a pregnancy.

439
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,480
The real purpose of this evening was to make several special announcements about the Daily

440
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:26,400
Wire's newest projects and to present the rebranding of their streaming service as Daily

441
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,400
Wire Plus.

442
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:35,680
I'm proud to announce that as of this very moment, we are launching Daily Wire Plus.

443
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:40,240
One of the announcements that was completely expected was their kids content initiative,

444
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,400
something that was already announced back in March when they pledged to invest $100

445
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
million into the project over three years.

446
00:26:47,200 --> 00:27:00,740
The big reveal here was a trailer for their newest series, Chip Chillas.

447
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:05,920
This looks completely generic and uninteresting, but hey, I'm an adult, so it's not really

448
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
for me.

449
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,840
I do suspect it might get a little political in its content because the kids division is

450
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:17,180
being fronted by Eric Branscom and Ethan Nicole, who are respectively responsible for the Christian

451
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:20,460
themed series Veggie Tales and the Babylon Bee.

452
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:24,180
At the very least, it seems likely that there will be some religious messaging in these

453
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,180
shows.

454
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:29,620
Also, they already announced this show over two months before this event, except they

455
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,860
were calling it Chilla Time back then.

456
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,940
Suspiciously absent from this event was the other kids show they had already announced,

457
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,980
Doodle with Noodles.

458
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,240
Perhaps they've just run into some legal trouble with the YouTube channel Gourmet Quilter

459
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,540
for stealing the name of one of its segments.

460
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:47,740
The next announcement was The Daily Wire's continuing partnership with PragerU, where

461
00:27:47,740 --> 00:28:02,860
all of PragerU's content would be made available on Daily Wire Plus.

462
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:08,460
This announcement seems even stranger, as PragerU's content is largely free already,

463
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,420
and they also announced they would be featuring PragerU content back in 2020.

464
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,140
But there is at least one new exclusive, something called the PragerU Masters Program

465
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,160
with Dennis Prager, videos in which, I imagine, Dennis Prager will offer pearls of wisdom,

466
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,900
such as why marital rape is okay.

467
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:31,660
If your husband is a good man, if you respect him, if he treats you beautifully, then don't

468
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,720
only allow your mood to determine whether you sleep with him.

469
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,200
That was the thesis of it.

470
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,700
Of course there are times when obviously that will determine, but not always.

471
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,780
Just as mood cannot determine, almost anything good that we do, I don't determine whether

472
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,180
I go to work based on my mood.

473
00:28:49,180 --> 00:28:53,420
Comparing having sex with your spouse with going to work really reveals a lot.

474
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:57,340
I did take some time to read the article Prager wrote when he was referencing this ridiculous

475
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,940
statement though, and it's even more wild than that clip suggests.

476
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:02,580
Here's a deranged excerpt.

477
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,620
A husband knows that his wife loves him first and foremost by her willingness to give her

478
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
body to him.

479
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:14,580
This seems not only disrespectful to women, placing their primary value in a relationship

480
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:20,500
as their body, it also degrades men as deciding to be with someone primarily because of said

481
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
body.

482
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,060
And this article was actually a two parter where he just digs himself deeper and deeper,

483
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:29,660
and it reads like this despicable emotional blackmail.

484
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:32,700
But it does include one section that did make me laugh.

485
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,300
If most women wait until they are in the mood before making love with their husband, many

486
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:39,820
women will be waiting a month or more until they next have sex.

487
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:44,380
If a woman is only in the mood once a month or less, I'm going to take a wild guess

488
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:49,580
that she either has a very unusually low sex drive or perhaps more likely the man in her

489
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:52,220
life isn't appealing to her sexually.

490
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,940
It is very funny to me that Dennis Prager wrote this.

491
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,820
Going back to the Daily Wire thing, the big announcement that evening wasn't some forgettable

492
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:03,100
cartoon or Dennis Prager once again revealing himself to be a monster, it was the announcement

493
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:16,460
that the Daily Wire would be producing content with Jordan Peterson.

494
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:21,100
The crowd, as you can tell from that reaction, are very excited.

495
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,740
At this event, Jordan Peterson seemed a bit off.

496
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:27,460
His usual word salad wasn't full effect, but he struggled to lift his gaze from the

497
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:31,740
ground and seemed to be spending less time on building caveats to everything he was saying

498
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,980
and instead drifted into entirely different subjects.

499
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,340
Maybe it was an off night for him, though considering his recent health concerns, we

500
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,460
might be seeing some of the lasting impact of those challenges.

501
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,100
Either way, it was kind of sad to watch.

502
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,180
This announcement did mean we would be getting more slickly produced Jordan Peterson content,

503
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:55,300
including one of the best new memes of the year.

504
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,380
And that was about all the new content people can expect on Daily Wire Plus.

505
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,100
A kid show that was already announced, a new PragerU show, and a new Jordan Peterson

506
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
series.

507
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:09,820
We didn't get a trailer for their next upcoming movie or any information on their TV series

508
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
that they teased a year and a half ago.

509
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:15,960
The main reason for this event seems more like a push to generate as many subscribers

510
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:33,320
now so they can afford the content they want to make in the future.

511
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,880
The Daily Wire doesn't sound like the storming success they act like.

512
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,440
If they were a startup, it would be more understandable, but it's been a year and a half since they

513
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,200
announced their plans to go into movies.

514
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,580
And if their new initiatives are as compelling as Shut In or Terror on the Prairie, it hardly

515
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,120
seems like a wise investment.

516
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,080
It's really hard to know how well the Daily Wire is doing financially.

517
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,360
I found a few numbers detailing their performance, but since their records are all private, it's

518
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,120
tough to really piece together anything.

519
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,560
Here's what level I could find.

520
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:05,440
According to their website, when the Daily Wire was launched in 2015, it did so with

521
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,000
investment from Ferris Wilkes, a billionaire in the fracking industry.

522
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:13,440
It's a bit unclear if they still receive any funding from Wilkes, though reading their

523
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,800
former About section on their website, it reads,

524
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,680
This statement, of course, doesn't mean that the Daily Wire isn't still receiving money

525
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:38,480
from Ferris Wilkes separately or through one of the other entities controlled by the brothers.

526
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,080
And the Wilkes brothers have a long history of supporting right-wing causes in the past,

527
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,480
such as providing funding for PragerU and the 2016 presidential campaign for Ted Cruz.

528
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,200
This very defensive-sounding About section has since been replaced with something more

529
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,200
generic.

530
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,200
In 2022, speaking to Axios, co-founder of the Daily Wire, Jeremy Boring claimed that

531
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:03,200
they had a 12-month revenue of $100 million in January of 2022, up from $65 million in

532
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,720
the previous year.

533
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,160
According to Forbes in April of 2022, Boring claimed that the Daily Wire had a run rate

534
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:15,120
of $150 million a year, a run rate being a predictor of future performance for the company.

535
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,720
He also said they had 600,000 subscribers.

536
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:25,280
At the June live event, he revealed that the current subscriber count is now 890,000.

537
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:31,440
We have hit a huge milestone, 890,000 active subscribers.

538
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,200
A nearly 50% increase in subscribers in the space of two months is pretty stunning, though

539
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:43,340
aside from Matt Walsh's documentary, I'm not sure what changed for the streaming service

540
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,080
between April and June to lead to such a big jump.

541
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:50,440
In a press release, the newly revised run rate for the company was up to $200 million

542
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
a year.

543
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,880
It does seem strange that, with a subscriber increase of nearly 50%, the run rate has only

544
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,760
gone up by 25%.

545
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,880
But I have no idea how they're calculating their future growth, so maybe it all makes

546
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,520
sense if you can see their actual numbers.

547
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:06,600
Subscribers aren't the only source of revenue for the company, they also run a number of

548
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,600
ads in their content.

549
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,360
It's hard to estimate exactly what they're earning in these ad spots, but presumably

550
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,040
it must be a sizable portion of their revenue.

551
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:18,360
So of the few metrics we have, the Daily Wire seems to be making decent money.

552
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:22,360
Whether or not they're covering their expenses, which includes producing several movies and

553
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,720
documentaries, web shows, kids programming and their book publishing, selling razors,

554
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:31,440
and of course, paying their 200 employees, it's not entirely clear that they can afford

555
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,280
all of these enterprises.

556
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,680
Boring was adamant about not taking the company public, though.

557
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:43,240
Where does this $100 million come from?

558
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:47,440
I'm wondering myself.

559
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,480
I can tell you this.

560
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:53,080
The Daily Wire has been approached by six different entities in the last three months

561
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,760
about doing a public offering by way of a SPAC.

562
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,520
And we have said no.

563
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,160
Not being publicly traded also means that their financial statements will not be readable

564
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
by the public.

565
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:09,040
So while Boring did tease that the company may go public in the future, it remaining

566
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,120
private lets them operate without us having any real insight to how they're doing financially,

567
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,760
aside from what they say in their marketing, which obviously is going to put them in their

568
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,360
best light possible.

569
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,880
Boring also had fun sharing less helpful statistics.

570
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,320
And for 18 months over the last two years, we were the number one publisher in the world,

571
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:32,000
the most engaged publisher in not the most engaged conservative publisher, not the most

572
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,360
engaged news publisher, the most engaged publisher of any kind in the world on the number one

573
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,360
platform, Facebook.

574
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,480
This is a very convoluted stat.

575
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,440
For one, those 18 months are not consecutive if they were across two years.

576
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:51,920
And while social media traction is important, it's strange to mention Facebook and only

577
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,160
Facebook and engagement doesn't mean getting the most views on the platform, but rather

578
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,760
getting the most reaction from viewers.

579
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,320
That is getting people to click one of those little reaction buttons on the page.

580
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,640
Unsurprisingly, political content designed to enrage or rile people up gets a lot of

581
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,640
clicks.

582
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:12,040
In October of 2020, Facebook pushed back against the idea that engagement reflects overall

583
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:16,440
popularity with an article that shows how political content is more likely to get engagement

584
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:21,200
but tends to rank much lower in overall reach compared to content from more neutral sources

585
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,480
such as videos with cute animals.

586
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,200
The data being from 2020 may not be entirely applicable to the present, but it does underscore

587
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,200
how engagement is a selective stat that doesn't necessarily reflect overall popularity on

588
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,400
the platform.

589
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,880
Of course, that doesn't mean that it's a meaningless stat or that the Daily Wire is

590
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
doing poorly.

591
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,000
High engagement is obviously a very good thing for them.

592
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,760
Much like their financial numbers, we should just take this stat with a grain of salt as

593
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,660
it's obviously part of their marketing.

594
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:52,040
But there is an interesting strategy being deployed by the Daily Wire regarding its social

595
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,840
media success, particularly on Facebook.

596
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:59,320
According to research from The Markup, a non-partisan, non-profit data research organization, the

597
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:04,160
Daily Wire strategy isn't really to target all Americans, but instead be the destination

598
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,480
for conservatives.

599
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,140
And their online marketing reveals their partisan approach.

600
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,960
This is in stark contrast to other media outlets which cast a wider net.

601
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:16,800
The Markup article includes comments from Francesca Tripodi, an assistant professor

602
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,800
at UNC School of Information and Library Sciences at Chapel Hill.

603
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
She said,

604
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,400
As you're looking at this dataset, to me it shows that mainstream media outlets like

605
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,400
the New York Times are still approaching the internet as a collective space in which you

606
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,920
could potentially learn about anything, from research or science to family and relationships.

607
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,800
But Daily Wire, if you're saying, we only want to target people who are interested in

608
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:43,600
conservatism in America, that creates this bifurcated or dual internet, and that allows

609
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:46,200
for information to circulate unchecked.

610
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,080
This means the Daily Wire's success isn't necessarily coming from the mainstream, but

611
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:54,920
rather it's targeting a specific audience, and that audience is incredibly receptive

612
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,920
to their message.

613
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,080
The Daily Wire is behaving less like a traditional media outlet, attempting to spread news to

614
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:04,520
everyone and more like a corporation targeting potential customers looking for a very specific

615
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,520
product.

616
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:09,160
An example used in the article is that they're acting like a food brand serving ads to people

617
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,840
who like potato chips.

618
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,080
The Markup also found that the Daily Wire uses a lot of tracking tools.

619
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:21,240
Using Blacklight, a website privacy inspector, on August 4th, 2021, they found 41 ad trackers

620
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:25,320
and 117 third party cookies on the Daily Wire's homepage.

621
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:30,120
In comparison, looking at the 100,000 most popular websites in September of 2020, on

622
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:34,920
average they used 7 ad trackers and 3 third party cookies.

623
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,720
In addition to making use of tracking tools and targeting specific communities, the Daily

624
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,800
Wire also invests a lot of money in sponsored posts promoting its content.

625
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,720
Earlier this year, Vice published an article detailing how the Daily Wire spent between

626
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:53,180
$35,000 and $47,000 on Facebook and Instagram ads promoting articles about the lawsuit between

627
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,860
Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.

628
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:59,280
One article in particular about the supposed character assassination of Johnny Depp had

629
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:04,560
somewhere between $20,000 and $25,000 alone promoting it by the Daily Wire.

630
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:09,000
Unsurprisingly, these articles included misinformation about the trial with the major article I

631
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:13,200
just mentioned having to include an embarrassing editor's note correcting the fact that Johnny

632
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Depp did not disprove 12 of the 14 allegations against him.

633
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,720
But I want to highlight just how much money is being spent by the Daily Wire to promote

634
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,560
their coverage of a single news story.

635
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,120
While we don't have concrete numbers on how much the Daily Wire spent on social media

636
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:30,920
ads in general, we can be sure their engagement is being driven by more than organic interest

637
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,680
in their content.

638
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:37,000
While this may paint the picture that the Daily Wire is particularly good at gaming

639
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,920
Facebook systems to build an audience further content, we also need to take into consideration

640
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,000
its history with the platform and how it built such a following on Facebook.

641
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,760
A 2019 article on popular information highlighted 14 large Facebook pages that seemingly operated

642
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,080
as independent outfits, sharing right-wing news stories.

643
00:39:56,080 --> 00:40:00,600
These 14 pages were fairly popular with a combined total of 8 million fans, and they

644
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:06,560
all had generic names such as conservative news or don't mess with America.

645
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,640
Only these supposedly independent outlets exclusively reposted Daily Wire articles,

646
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:16,360
with many of them making identical posts down to the same minute, meaning these 14 pages

647
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:21,720
all, coincidentally, only thought the Daily Wire posted anything worth sharing and all

648
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,840
shared new articles the second they went live.

649
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,360
Or what was more likely here is that these supposedly independent pages were all being

650
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:35,160
secretly operated by the Daily Wire, which would be in violation of Facebook's rules.

651
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:39,160
When this 2019 article was published, all of these pages would eventually update their

652
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,960
about sections to include the line, proudly managed by the Daily Wire.

653
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,400
Although for some reason don't mess with America's page only reads, proudly managed

654
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,620
be.

655
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,360
This newfound pride over their management only became clear after Facebook updated its

656
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:56,580
transparency standards and only after this strategy was exposed.

657
00:40:56,580 --> 00:41:01,100
The popular information article also highlights how, by not disclosing this relationship,

658
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:04,240
the Daily Wire was in violation of Facebook's terms of service.

659
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,820
In the past, similar behavior from other groups had led to those pages being banned, but the

660
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:12,060
Daily Wire seems to have been given a pass.

661
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:15,600
Also in this same article, they spoke to a former Facebook employee who identified a

662
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:21,000
bias towards right-wing media by Joel Kaplan, Facebook's head of global public policy

663
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:24,320
and a former member of the George W. Bush administration.

664
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,080
The former employee is quoted saying,

665
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,720
"...anytime there is an issue with Breitbart or Daily Caller, Joel made the decision, and

666
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,880
he always acted to protect them."

667
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,960
There was also that well-documented 2019 dinner between Ben Shapiro and Mark Zuckerberg that

668
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:42,040
was held to supposedly talk about free speech on the platform.

669
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,720
It also puts into perspective that Facebook story I mentioned a bit earlier about the

670
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,560
limitations of engagement.

671
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:51,480
I do still think it has valid information highlighting that engagement isn't the end

672
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:56,720
of the story and it isn't the best stat to monitor success on Facebook, but it could

673
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,820
also be that Facebook is instead trying a way to spin the news that their algorithm

674
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,360
is pushing right-wing media so hard.

675
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:08,820
Far from being silenced by big tech, allying the Daily Wire love saying it by themselves,

676
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:13,980
when it comes to the Facebook platform specifically, the Daily Wire seems to be given more space

677
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:18,140
to break the rules and they have access to the biggest guy in the company.

678
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:22,780
Even though these days, those 14 aforementioned Facebook pages aren't the driving force

679
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:27,340
and don't get quite as much engagement as, say, Ben Shapiro sharing a story would, I

680
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:29,880
think it's important to remember their foundational work.

681
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:34,340
It was crucial in building up the Daily Wire's audience in its earliest years and it reveals

682
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:38,980
that the secret to their growth isn't genuine organic interest in their content, but rather

683
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:42,980
the Daily Wire exploiting their relationship with Facebook to cheat the system in ways

684
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,980
other publishers couldn't.

685
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:48,920
Forgettable movies, the gnashing of conservative teeth, and an aggressive social media campaign

686
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,900
that courts a right-wing audience.

687
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,800
What does any of this mean?

688
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:56,220
What the Daily Wire is attempting to do is create an all-encompassing bubble for right-wing

689
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,220
media.

690
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,860
They may talk a big game about taking on Disney or Netflix and when it comes to profits, maybe

691
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,380
that really is the dream.

692
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:06,940
But looking at their current strategy, it's less built on appealing to the mainstream

693
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:12,260
in some kind of bid to replace them and instead appealing directly to conservative audiences.

694
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:16,100
Looking back on its movies, content they allege is politically neutral, they market

695
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:20,900
this content as rejecting the mainstream supposedly woke voices of Disney.

696
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,780
They say quite explicitly that these movies are for people who feel as though Hollywood

697
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,780
hates them.

698
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:29,620
They'll still let you watch their movies, of course, their TV shows, their news, their

699
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:33,540
sports, but you'll have to do it knowing that everyone who made that content, at least

700
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,860
everyone at the top, hates you.

701
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:39,860
You have to watch it knowing that every dollar you spend on theater tickets, on cable bills,

702
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:43,500
on streaming subscriptions is going to the people that hate you, funding their hatred

703
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:44,500
of you.

704
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:47,860
Not only that, but they're going to spend every day on Twitter, every spare moment at

705
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,060
every award show, and just about every second of every show that they make reminding you

706
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:55,220
of the fact that they hate you.

707
00:43:55,220 --> 00:44:00,300
Their concept of the average American happens to be the American who agrees with them.

708
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:02,360
In other words, conservatives.

709
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:06,580
By offering a program that includes sports, kid's shows, political commentary, documentaries

710
00:44:06,580 --> 00:44:10,860
and TikTok-style videos, they are trying to appeal to as many people as possible, who

711
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:12,860
adhere to their conservative values.

712
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,060
And once they have these people, I suspect the goal is to keep them trapped in their

713
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,740
media bubble, and to own the conservative media niche.

714
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,960
This isn't a new strategy, and we can see something similar when it comes to the world

715
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,700
of Christian media.

716
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:35,460
The Left Behind books, which tell the story about how the rapture will affect the world,

717
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,940
have sold over 65 million copies.

718
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:41,380
Unless you're a fan of the cinematic stylings of Kirk Cameron or Nicolas Cage, there's

719
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:44,180
a pretty good chance you haven't heard of them, but they've sold more copies than

720
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:47,420
the Magic School Bus, the Hardy Boys, and Tarzan.

721
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:51,500
The Christian music scene, which, while often a punchline in the mainstream, has been chugging

722
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:55,500
along for decades, making stars and earning millions of dollars.

723
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,220
And if you watch certain videos here on YouTube, you might even be familiar with the Christian

724
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:03,900
movie scene, which includes the classics God's Not Dead, Christmas with a capital C, and

725
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,340
Heaven is for Real.

726
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:09,300
And naturally, Christian movies have their own streaming service, Pure Flix.

727
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,980
The Christian media scene has existed for decades, and it's been making huge amounts

728
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,340
of money the whole time.

729
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:18,100
Part of what makes it work is that it has a faithful audience that is, sometimes, ready

730
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,460
to spend big money for media that reaffirms their worldview.

731
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:23,780
Although in the world of Christian media, there are many different stakeholders and

732
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,420
platforms offering their own services.

733
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:30,700
Products and industries with their own ecosystems have always existed, of course, usually occupying

734
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:31,700
niches.

735
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,900
If you're a fan of anime, you get your own little section on Netflix, or you can get

736
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,660
streaming services directly for that.

737
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,940
And of course, there's merch, movie screens, and other fun bonuses that come with being

738
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:40,940
into it.

739
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,680
What separates Christian media from niche interests like these, though, is that it builds

740
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,740
this strange parallel universe by explicitly rejecting the mainstream, unless the mainstream

741
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:53,020
accepts them, to create its own bubble of content.

742
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,140
A random person can probably name an anime, but unless someone is in that Christian media

743
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,380
bubble, whether they're enjoying it as an insider or mocking it as an outsider, you'd

744
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,340
be hard-pressed to find many people who have even heard of the biggest hits in that space.

745
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:08,780
If you took a random sample of people, I think the odds are pretty good that more of them

746
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:12,340
would recognize Dragon Ball than they would Gods Not Dead.

747
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,100
Also for the record, I'm pretty sure Goku could beat up Kevin Sorbo.

748
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:18,780
The Daily Wire is taking this strategy of creating an insular bubble of content and

749
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:23,020
going a step further, creating a parallel landscape for conservative media, but trying

750
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:27,180
to do it all themselves in what might become one giant company.

751
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:31,780
They want to be the one-stop-shop for anything and everything in the conservative media space,

752
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:35,180
and to capture that audience that supposedly feels threatened by the mainstream.

753
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:38,660
And if they aren't feeling threatened, then the Daily Wire is happy to publish all the

754
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:41,060
propaganda they need to create that fear.

755
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,300
I'm not enough of a media expert to make any predictions on whether or not they'll

756
00:46:44,300 --> 00:46:45,300
be succeeding.

757
00:46:45,300 --> 00:46:49,140
It is pretty plain that they are spending a lot of money, not just on production, but

758
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,100
on marketing for all of their content.

759
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,580
One of the things they touted during their media presentation, and in many other instances

760
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:58,620
when they speak to the public, is their platform's ability to market content.

761
00:46:58,620 --> 00:47:02,620
Part of that seems to be the unwavering devotion their core audience seems to have, willing

762
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,740
to buy razors or children's books if the Daily Wire tells them to.

763
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:11,100
How else can one explain them selling these ridiculous truth bombs on their website for

764
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,100
$174?

765
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:16,700
Though it does remain to be seen just how large this core audience is, and how much

766
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,340
more the Daily Wire can expand it.

767
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:23,220
The success of the Daily Wire's media venture rests on the idea that they can continue to

768
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:26,260
expand their audience and recoup all these expenses.

769
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:30,620
Jeremy Boring repeatedly emphasized the need for the Daily Wire to keep growing.

770
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,220
Some of that, I'm sure, is motivated by the profit they want to make, but it's probably

771
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:38,300
a necessity to pay for all these projects that are likely in need for funding.

772
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,220
The fate of this media venture may reflect, in dollars and cents, the strength of the

773
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,140
conservative movement in America.

774
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:47,700
If it truly does have the popular support it would require to fund all of this, then

775
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:53,200
it may very well be that the niche of American conservatives is enough to build a media empire.

776
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,320
But if it fails, it would instead reflect how the American public isn't as conservative

777
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,640
as the Daily Wire imagined them to be.

778
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:03,680
Or it might fail and prove that the Daily Wire was never any good at producing media

779
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,600
outside of hate-fueled clickbait.

780
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:10,880
This video is a little different from my previous ones as it kind of feels like two videos squished

781
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,240
together, but I just felt as though the two subjects complimented each other really well

782
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:19,680
and when talking about the Daily Wire, I wanted to go a bit deeper than just looking at a

783
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:23,000
movie or only looking at their business ventures.

784
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:26,400
So I hope this fits together well enough and that you enjoyed it.

785
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,360
And if you really enjoyed it, do consider becoming a patron or a member for the channel.

786
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,200
You can see the names of some of those people on the screen right now and don't they look

787
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:34,200
lovely?

788
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:38,520
They also get early access to videos along with some other fun bonuses that I surprise

789
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,160
them with every now and again.

790
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,320
If you would like to support this channel in a non-monetary fashion, you can like, comment,

791
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:48,040
subscribe, hit the bell for notifications, and also consider sharing it on social media

792
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:49,040
because that helps out too.

793
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,800
If you'd like to leave a comment and don't know what to say, how about pitching your

794
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:58,440
idea for a movie for the Daily Wire and maybe they'll read it into it.

795
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,600
Thank you all so much for watching.
