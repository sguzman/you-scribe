1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,620
Tucker Carlson hosts the most popular cable news show on television his most recent ratings show

2
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:11,360
He averaged 3.2 million viewers a night on Fox News with his Tucker Carlson tonight program

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,560
It debuted on November 14th 2016 originally at 7 p.m

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:21,400
But following the cancellation of the O'Reilly Factor Tucker inherited the 8 p.m. Time slot in 2017

5
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,480
The show grew in popularity topping out at four point three three million viewers in the second quarter of 2020 the most viewers ever

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:35,800
For a cable news program in the United States the show proves so popular that Fox News expanded its relationship with Tucker Carlson in the spring

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,320
Of 2021 by giving him a morning show Tucker Carlson today that errors three times a week and Tucker Carlson originals

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,440
Which airs once a month both of these appearing on the Fox Nation streaming platform

9
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,280
If you're not familiar with who Tucker Carlson is a very brief recap is that he lived a middle-class life as a child

10
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:57,440
Until his father married into the wealthy Swanson family whose fortune come from those frozen TV dinners

11
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,720
His privileged life led him to a career in journalism where he wrote for a few conservative outlets in

12
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,400
2000 he worked at CNN on a show called crossfire

13
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:11,560
This show ended when he was embarrassed by John Stewart on camera and Carlson did not renew his CNN contract

14
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:17,600
He then spent some time at PBS had a show on MSNBC for a few years before finally finding a home at Fox News in

15
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:24,160
2009 where he was eventually given his own show in 2017 if you want more details about the history of Tucker Carlson

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:30,120
I highly recommend this recap of his life from some more news with all this Tucker Carlson content on offer

17
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,320
I decided to consume a whole week's worth of his stuff to get an idea of what it's like to be in the Tucker Carlson

18
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,680
Audience and what it feels like to get the full effect of his work. This is for the week of October 18th

19
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,480
2021 now

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:55,160
The first part of every episode of Tucker Carlson tonight is the feature story typically rating from 15 to 20 minutes

21
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:59,240
It makes a path of each episode and is usually the part that has everyone buzzing the next day

22
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,040
These feature stories are largely centered around a monologue where Carlson builds his case and they're capped off with a brief interview

23
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,120
The October 18th edition of the show offers a great example

24
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:12,720
It began with the recent passing of former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Unlike other people in Washington Colin Powell got where he was on merit and that was inspiring to watch and eventually it turned

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,240
Into a rant about how Americans are living in a medical apartheid state

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,920
We have a division medical apartheid

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,840
We have rules but some people have exempted themselves from the rules and they're not ashamed of it

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,960
Here's how he made the jump the crucial step in drawing a connection between

30
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,840
Powell's death and this authoritarian nightmare is that Powell died of complications related to COVID-19

31
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,680
Even though he had been vaccinated once this connection is made two minutes into this 14-minute segment. It stops being about Powell entirely

32
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:55,920
Like almost everyone his age Colin Powell was fully vaccinated against COVID and yet according to his family and doctors

33
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,240
Colin Powell died of COVID. Of course that fact does not make his death any less sad

34
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,960
Nor is it unusual many thousands of vaccinated Americans have died of COVID

35
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:12,160
Former CDC director Robert Redfield announced just today that about 40% of all recent COVID deaths in the state of Maryland

36
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,640
For example are among those who have had both shots

37
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:22,240
This is a deeply deceptive stat looking at Maryland alone the eighth most vaccinated state with at the time of writing

38
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,640
65.8% of its population being fully vaccinated

39
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:32,740
This would mean that breakthrough cases that is cases of vaccinated people suffering from COVID would be more common because such a large

40
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,860
percentage of the state is fully vaccinated

41
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,060
The State Department of Health agrees writing in a statement as the number of our residents who are vaccinated

42
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:47,660
Continues to increase we expect to see an increase in the proportion of COVID related deaths occurring in vaccinated individuals

43
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,060
Many of these deaths are linked to comorbidities that make patients more vulnerable

44
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,860
Even on its face though if most people are fully vaccinated and the majority of deaths are still attributed to the unvaccinated

45
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,020
It seems like getting a vaccine is a good idea

46
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:06,780
A wider view of the numbers available from the CDC reveals that COVID deaths are dramatically more common among the unvaccinated

47
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,940
With the unvaccinated being 11 times more likely to die of COVID than the vaccinated

48
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,580
Powell's death is an anecdote a high profile case of something that isn't terribly common

49
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,780
It's being used to push a narrative about skepticism towards the vaccine

50
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,420
It's all a pretense to get to the real message of the segment. What tells you you've been lied to

51
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,420
Vaccines may be highly useful for some people but across a population they do not solve COVID

52
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:36,220
The language here is crucial. What does solve COVID even mean that a vaccine will completely eliminate it?

53
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:43,180
Vaccines rarely eradicate illnesses with the only transmissible one among humans that has been wiped out so far being smallpox

54
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:49,580
The vague usage of solve and how it will never be achieved is how carlson can apply that the vaccine really isn't worth getting

55
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:57,020
At least for most people without outright denying it has any significant effect at all his earlier statement implies that it's a very narrow effect

56
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,980
Vaccines may be highly useful for some people

57
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,980
The covet vaccine has been demonstrated to dramatically reduce one's chance of death

58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,860
But the number of deaths aren't the only talking point carlson uses

59
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,140
Carlson also says the vaccine doesn't effectively slow the spread of covet. This also isn't true

60
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,580
Craig spencer an emergency medicine physician and director of global health and emergency medicine at new york

61
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:21,500
Presbyterian columbia university medical center writing for the atlantic said

62
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:28,300
Despread the coronavirus you have to have the coronavirus and vaccinated people are far less likely to have the corona virus

63
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,580
period

64
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,940
Even in instances of breakthrough cases where a vaccinated person is infected with the delta variant of covet

65
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:38,780
Preliminary data shows that transmission is reduced by 63 percent

66
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,940
Albeit for a period of a few months for the alpha variant of covet transmission is even more greatly reduced by a vaccine

67
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,180
Increasing to 73 percent a lot of this data is still being peer reviewed

68
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:54,220
But so far the majority of the science seems to be saying the exact opposite of what tucker carlson is asserting

69
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:58,220
But he doesn't say any of it in intent to accurately discuss the science of the day

70
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:05,900
It's all the guys to get to what he really wants to talk about president biden is demanding obedience and people are fearfully obeying him

71
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:07,660
They're afraid of you

72
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,100
They can't explain why they're afraid of you the president told them that you are dangerous and so they're afraid

73
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:20,620
The question is over time. What does that do to your most cherished relationships to your friendship to your family relationships?

74
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,180
What does it do to the country?

75
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:30,060
The biden administration is apparently using the pandemic to destroy american families or as tucker would put it

76
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:36,620
America has once again become what it was when colin powell got his commission in the army

77
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:42,380
America has become segregated not between black and white but between vaccinated and unvaccinated

78
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,740
This is how tucker creates the illusion of a coherent narrative

79
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:53,500
Colin powell being alive during segregation is purely incidental and segregation itself was a deliberate attempt to restrict black people from positions of

80
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:56,940
Powered influence within american society because of the color of their skin

81
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:02,940
Which is hardly the same as not letting someone who is far more likely to carry an infectious disease eat at an applebee's

82
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,540
But what makes tucker carlson particularly effective is that he isn't just spreading partisan talking points

83
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,900
His monologues also include a healthy dose of conspiracy theories

84
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:18,380
This is a pandemic of the chinese government born in a lab in wuhan and brought here either accidentally or not

85
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,980
That's the fact of it

86
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,900
This is also not a fact

87
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,740
The current state of the debate according to an article in the new yorker is that there is no conclusive evidence to support that claim

88
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,220
And most scientists who study viruses are inclined to say it was a naturally occurring virus

89
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:39,260
The most plausible version of this theory is that it was being studied at this lab and was accidentally leaked because of a lack of safety precautions

90
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,300
Not that it was created by the chinese government

91
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,500
The rent continues like this for nearly 10 minutes

92
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:51,980
It's a fire hose of misinformation and by 10 minutes in it's spiraling into madness as a few seconds of video of joe biden

93
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:55,660
Not wearing a mask at a restaurant is used as evidence of him declaring himself

94
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,540
Some kind of grand ruler as only servants wear masks, but he didn't wear a mask

95
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,140
Why?

96
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,660
Because masks are for servants and he's the president. He's not a servant

97
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:11,100
The official explanation here is that biden was eating at a restaurant and was in the process of putting his mask back on

98
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Having taken it off to eat his food

99
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,740
Something that I am inclined to believe since you can clearly see him molding the mask as he walks

100
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,980
The video was widely circulated on right-wing media as biden flaunting the rules

101
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,860
But tucker carlson takes it even further saying biden meant to be filmed to send a message to americans

102
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:32,940
A message that ironically never would have been heard had not right-wing media figures like himself obsessed over it

103
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,100
This clip itself is not a story

104
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:41,260
But it does offer a wonderful example of how right-wing media takes innocuous footage to concoct a narrative biden being slow to put

105
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:45,260
His mask on is now him telling america that he is their god king

106
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:48,220
And wasn't this whole segment about colin pal's death?

107
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,940
And now we're talking about how joe biden being filmed in a restaurant not wearing a mask for a few seconds

108
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,660
Means he's crowning himself the emperor of america

109
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,700
It was as if this whole monologue was written independent of pal's death

110
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:02,380
And then that part was inserted later to make the narrative seem newsworthy

111
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:07,100
And one last detail about colin powell carston did eventually share with us also seemed important

112
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:10,220
So being the show we told you about colin powell

113
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,780
We left out that colin powell was suffering from a number of different health problems

114
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:18,940
But of course, that's the point the point of vaccinating the vulnerable is so

115
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,500
People with other underlying health problems won't die of covet

116
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,500
But unfortunately that didn't work in the case of general powell and it didn't work for many thousands of other americans

117
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,580
And of course, that's the point we're making in the first place

118
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Colum pal was suffering from multiple myeloma which compromised his immune system making the vaccine less effective

119
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,780
An important detail if you're trying to claim that the vaccine itself is ineffective a detail that completely undermines his entire rant

120
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,060
Which is why it happens more than 25 minutes after the segment is over just as the show is going off the air

121
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,420
Because this rant was a con and tucker carlson knows it

122
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:58,700
But that monologue was believe it or not the strongest and most convincing one I saw that week

123
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:02,780
I want to talk about two other ones that show us how things can get really crazy on this show

124
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:08,380
On october 20th tucker carlson started a show with a segment that had an impressive number of jumps

125
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:13,580
We started with a statement about how america was changed by the black lives matter movement of 2020

126
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:15,820
This really was the pivot point

127
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,860
It was the height of the blm riots early last summer

128
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:25,260
Which turns into a story of how the media lies to people msnbc's explicit editorial policy

129
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:31,580
To lie about what you were watching live to characterize violent riots as peaceful protests

130
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,700
And then this moves to a discussion about looting the country your ancestors built is on fire

131
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,580
But shut up because your ancestors also burned it down

132
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,980
Which pivots to an article about supply chain issues in the u.s

133
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,700
The washington post just ran this headline and we're quoting

134
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:51,740
Don't rant about short staff stores and supply chain woes

135
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:55,580
And apparently america is now falling apart. Don't complain

136
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:01,820
As your life becomes worse and as your country degrades this leads to a point about store closures

137
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:08,780
You notice the wall greens is for example closed and so is the cvs because everything in there has been stolen

138
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:13,980
By thieves who have now been redefined as civil rights protesters. Stop complaining karen

139
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:19,180
And suddenly we're talking about cities being overrun with drug addicts. Oh, wait a second

140
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,260
They're junkies living intense right across from your kid's school

141
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,860
Well that they've always been there too. They were there when you were a kid

142
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,740
You just never noticed just readjust your expectations settle down karen and their undocumented immigrant rapist on trains

143
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,740
Last week several people on train they got on the train and then they got to watch as a man raped a woman

144
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,860
On the train for minutes and biden's border policy is destroying america

145
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:50,380
You want more of this? We may be getting it today joe biden's nominee to lead the border patrol a guy called chris magnus

146
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,620
Set for his confirmation hearings

147
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:57,660
Now it turns out that magnus if anything is to the left of biden

148
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,780
Even to the left of barack obama on immigration matters

149
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,540
Did you follow all that black lives matter is somehow connected to joe biden destroying america with immigrants?

150
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:13,100
Or the impression carlson's audience more likely got that america is being destroyed and it's biden's fault

151
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,620
The house and wise aren't important. The segment isn't designed to be coherent

152
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:23,900
It's designed to create a vague feeling of fear about the state of america and to direct that fear and possibly anger towards joe biden

153
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,340
The segment itself is of course filled with misinformation

154
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,080
Take the op-ed from the washington post which tucker claims is an attack on americans telling them to lower their expectations

155
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:37,920
As if they need to be ready for some kind of socialist hellscape

156
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,580
Lower your expectations. What did you expect in america?

157
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,140
Come on

158
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,140
Bread lines we've always had bread lines

159
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,260
It's sort of charmingly retro these bread lines if we read beyond the headline what the article by micheline manard

160
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,580
Actually says is

161
00:12:55,580 --> 00:13:00,540
Rather than living constantly on the verge of throwing a fit and risking taking it out on overwhelmed servers

162
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:07,040
Struggling shop owners or late arriving delivery people. We do ourselves a favor by consciously lowering expectations

163
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,340
Rather than being an attack on americans

164
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,340
It's a simple plea for americans not to take their frustrations out on workers who have no control over supply chain issues

165
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:21,740
Carlson also claims that wall green stores in san francisco are closing because of organized shoplifting. San francisco has

166
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,940
Very few wallgreens or cvs or stores like that left because they've all been looted

167
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,940
by civil rights protesters

168
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:36,300
This is contradicted by numbers from the police which do not support this wave of shoplifting at wallgreens a narrative codman on social media

169
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:43,740
Based on a handful of cell phone videos wallgreens has not only refused to share internal data related to shoplifting with reporters in san francisco

170
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:51,020
Their parent company wallgreens boots alliance was forecasting between 150 and 400 store closures by 2024

171
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:57,740
since 2016 wallgreens has closed 22 stores in san francisco and those numbers include the recent story tuckers responding to

172
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,180
In which wallgreens had announced it was closing five stores

173
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:07,900
Now san francisco has very few wallgreens or cvs or stores like that left because they've all been looted

174
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:13,500
It still has 53 stores operating in san francisco a far cry from what tucker claims

175
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:18,700
Also not mentioned in this segment is that in new york city wallgreens is shutting down 16 stores

176
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:23,580
I suspect it might have made it into the segment had they found cell phone footage of a black person stealing something though

177
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:31,740
Which by the way is used to justify the earlier mention of black lives matter, which was about making shoplifting legal according to tucker carlson

178
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:38,140
It's also interesting to see how tucker carlson who many describe as a populace parroting the talking points of a corporation like wallgreens

179
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:44,300
Which happily spreads the organized shoplifting talking point to disguise the fact that it had been planning to close stores

180
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:47,340
regardless of this supposed wave of shoplifting

181
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:53,340
Perhaps tucker is happily towing this corporate line because it at least lets him demonize black communities

182
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:57,420
It's the jumps that really make this segment more than misinformation though

183
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:03,180
The narrative through line of america's decay is barely held together as tucker jumps from one sensationalized story to another

184
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:08,460
And he uses folksy little turns of phrase or rolls out the carrot insult to engage his audience emotionally

185
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:15,340
This isn't designed to get people thinking about the news of the day. It's designed to rally their emotions against the left

186
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:22,780
Tucker carlson's opening stories are so narrative focused that sometimes he doesn't even need to misrepresent actual news stories

187
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:27,020
In some cases he just presents something made up entirely out of nothing

188
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:30,540
That is so obviously true in the october 21st show

189
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,120
This segment opens with some truly shocking footage released by the biden administration

190
00:15:45,340 --> 00:16:08,700
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to my president, happy birthday to you

191
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,020
Before moving on I want everyone to take a moment and think about what this video says

192
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,860
And you don't need any deep analysis here

193
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:23,100
Just think about the events you saw unfold and what they were about really ask yourself. Does anything seem amiss here?

194
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:25,740
Does this footage reveal some hidden truth?

195
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,860
Okay, here's what tucker thought when he watched that video

196
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:34,780
It's like a room full of aliens have gathered to act out this concept. They've just heard about called happiness

197
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,780
The head alien is a super naturally strange being called

198
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,580
Kamala harris who for reasons no one ever explains walks into a room in the most secure building in the world

199
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,540
With a piece of elasti-sized fabric over her face like that's totally normal just another masked birthday celebration

200
00:16:53,340 --> 00:17:00,960
harris suddenly yells surprise at her own surprise birthday party like she's hosting the event for one of her multiple personalities

201
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,740
What the hell is going on here?

202
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:10,300
I can answer that question harris acted awkwardly during a surprise birthday party and everyone is wearing masks because of covet

203
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:13,100
But tucker has to pretend this is some bizarre

204
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,340
unthinkable scenario where people are acting in strange and confusing ways ways that reveal a deep mental rot at the core of the

205
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,380
biden white house

206
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:26,140
He goes on for several minutes about these videos making a number of strange points like that. No one says gorgeous anymore

207
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:31,440
She goes on to use the word gorgeous a word that no actual human being has used since 1977

208
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:39,520
I am completely willing to believe no one calls tucker gorgeous, but that doesn't mean no one says it. First of all is the answer. Yes

209
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:51,680
Ready to work. I am ready to do this with you for you. I I just i'm just deeply honored and i'm very excited

210
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,480
Whoa

211
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:01,840
Indeed nearly six minutes in and all tucker is talking about are these social media posts

212
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,080
He's calling them staged and even if they are

213
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:11,920
So what their pieces of pr are designed to make president biden and vice president harris seem more human and relatable much like your grandpa

214
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,640
Joe biden also doesn't know how to turn off a speakerphone

215
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,320
If these moments are staged the fact that none of these people are actors should explain the awkward delivery

216
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:26,080
But to tucker carlson, there's something far more sinister more sinister than north korean military propaganda

217
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,160
But what's the message of the joe and kamala videos?

218
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
All your nightmares are real the people in charge are even worse than you thought they were

219
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,160
Kamala may have seemed kind of fake to you joe may have looked a little out of it

220
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,160
But actually the white house is now telling us you don't know the half of it

221
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,600
According to tucker the white house is trying to tell everyone that these people are losing their mind or robots

222
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:53,040
These are presented as basic readings of these videos and not right-wing spin and that's what makes it so effective

223
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,000
The phrasing demands the audience accept the basic premise just to get to the conspiracy theory

224
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,080
You must believe joe biden is senile before getting to the idea that this is a deliberate move by the white house to rub it

225
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,520
in everyone's faces

226
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,360
Why they would do this is never really explored the conspiracy theory is a bonus

227
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:15,840
Because the main point here is to reinforce the idea that joe biden is senile and that kamala harris is some kind of robot

228
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,760
This is one third of the way into this night's commentary and have you spotted anything newsworthy so far?

229
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:28,640
All we've seen is tucker carlson opine about some harmless social media pr posts, but it does get even more intense

230
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,960
In december of last year kamala harris who grew up in canada a foreign country

231
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,920
I appreciate the subtle menace tucker carlson has when he describes canada as a foreign country

232
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,160
We usually don't get much credit for how scary we are tucker is really shocked at how brazen a lie harris told was though

233
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,720
Swore that she witnessed quote multiple generations of her family celebrating kwanza an american holiday

234
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,840
That was invented in long beach california after kamala harris was born. Not one word is true, but not one word is believable

235
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,120
Again, it was a prepared statement. It was carefully considered. They didn't even bother to look at a calendar

236
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:09,520
Luckily for us. I did look at a calendar kamala harris was born in 1964 in california

237
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,480
The american celebration of kwanza was first held in

238
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:20,640
1966 so the idea of kamala harris celebrating this with her family including parents and grandparents as a child seems pretty reasonable

239
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,820
This is likely what she meant when she said celebrating across generations

240
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:30,400
As for the canada part harris was born in california and moved to montreal when she was 12

241
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,160
She moved back to the us at 18 to attend howard university in washington d.c

242
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,740
So is it really hard to imagine that between the ages of 2 and 12 she might have celebrated kwanza with her parents and grandparents

243
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
Also kwanza may have started in the u.s

244
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:50,400
But it's celebrated in canada too and even if it wasn't there are no canadian laws preventing american families

245
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,880
From celebrating kwanza in montreal the segment is nearly 10 minutes through and it's completely filled with stuff like this

246
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,400
Tucker carlson reacting to dopey videos released by the white house

247
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,800
This is the news he thinks is worth commenting on and to make it seem worthwhile

248
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,640
He needs to make it sound as dramatic and scary as possible. It goes as far as to compare it to a cult

249
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,280
It's kind of nuts when you think about it

250
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,360
These people literally have no idea how absurd they look and how could they they live in a tiny airless cult

251
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,600
Wherever one pretends that joe biden is fully competent. Kamala harris is a civil rights hero

252
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:31,200
It's jones town and he brings a guest on to tell us that these videos are somehow related to communism

253
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,680
It's because every part of the system is so corrupt now and rotted with this communist filth

254
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,800
And that would you think of everyone here as sociopaths these people are not capable of that kind of shame

255
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,240
It's not in their nature. They are completely lost. They're sociopaths all of them

256
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,280
This is literally all this segment is I suspect the jesse keller interview only went on as long as it did over three minutes

257
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,840
Because of how little substance was actually present

258
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:01,120
I'm genuinely impressed that tucker carlson took something as flat and sparse of content such as pr videos on white house social media

259
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:06,400
And turned it into a narrative about some kind of biden cult slash obama's third term

260
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,400
This is obama's third term and these people are picked because they're compliant and hollow

261
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:17,680
But this segment more than all the others demonstrates what this show does it takes news stories or sometimes things that are barely news

262
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:24,500
Events lies about them and then builds these fantastic narratives of cults and oppression to oppose the biden administration

263
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,480
Isn't to have a political disagreement. It's to be standing against the monstrous sociopaths who want to destroy america

264
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:37,280
It catastrophizes political reality to such an extreme that the opposition can only be understood as the most dire of threats

265
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,880
And then tucker will in the same breath complain about how the other side is trying to divide us

266
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:50,320
Which is rich coming from someone who uses a video about flowers being delivered to push a narrative about a cult destroying america

267
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,560
While the opening segment is tucker carlson's show at its purest

268
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,240
The show does go on for another 20 to 25 minutes after it's over

269
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:05,200
These are the quick hits where five or six different stories are crammed into tiny segments that leave the audience less informed and more afraid

270
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,160
Here's a quick example of a story from the october 18th episode in recent weeks

271
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:18,080
Thousands of illegal aliens have been flown from the texas border into westchester county airport in new york on charter jets

272
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,800
Presented as breaking news is the story of children being flown from the southern us border to new york

273
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,840
He interviews conservative new york post columnist miranda divine for details by the government

274
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,000
They were all unaccompanied children

275
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,360
But several of them did look to us to be males in their 20s late teens

276
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:43,120
Some of the language here should raise some alarm according to the government the people being brought to new york are all children

277
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:49,120
But according to divine some of them looked older the photos used on tv make it tough to tell

278
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
But if you look at the new york post article

279
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,000
There are much clearer photos of these people who are obviously children as they're significantly shorter than the man who is escorting them

280
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,840
Also when divine claims that these flights are coming in the dead of night that isn't what we're seeing in these photos

281
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:09,760
According to the article these photos were of flights that arrived at 9 52 pm and 10 49 pm

282
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,360
There is a record of two flights landing at 2 13 a.m

283
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,120
And 4 29 a.m on august 20th, but these are the only examples offered in the article that might be considered

284
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
The dead of night

285
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:26,320
It then describes that these children are being sent to family members and those without family members are going to an organization called

286
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:33,440
Mercy first which works with the u.s office of refugee resettlement to find kids who have been granted refugee status safe homes

287
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:38,720
These brief few minutes are used to illustrate that the biden administration is somehow breaking the law

288
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,520
and that it needs to offer greater transparency on where refugee children are being settled because

289
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:49,520
Well, they never really say why tucker does mention that some kind of federal law is being violated

290
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,520
But he doesn't say which one and the only evidence of something nefarious going on

291
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,880
Is that some of these flights might be past the bedtimes of these children?

292
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,520
They can't come out and say what they want their audience to think because that wouldn't be as safe as the dog whistle

293
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:06,960
They're using instead. This is a segment designed to portray refugee children as a danger to america

294
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,840
Tucker Carlson tonight crams in five to six of these segments every night in its second half

295
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:19,040
Much like the opening segment the rife with conspiracy theories such as vaccines for military personnel being used to get christians out of the military

296
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,520
So by forcing this

297
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,960
You get to find out who sincerely believes in god

298
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:30,560
And then you know, you know their names at that point and then you can expel them using the pretext of the covid vaccine

299
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,040
The ufo is going after american nukes

300
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,880
UFOs interacted with nuclear weapons platforms

301
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,960
And either rendered them inoperable or took them offline

302
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:48,000
The content matters less than the general feeling these segments create to distrust any mainstream narrative and to believe any story tucker

303
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,080
Is telling you no matter how outlandish

304
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,080
All these different topics

305
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,040
Particularly the ones that are highlighted in the second half of the show are a means to maintain talking points

306
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:03,360
That aren't necessarily the hot topic of the moment such as critical race theory or affirmative consent on college campuses

307
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:10,960
The vague general threats of non-white people and feminism is kept alive in the minds of viewers whenever stories like these are referenced

308
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,880
It also gives them the appearance of legitimacy as if these are ongoing issues that need to be monitored rather than

309
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:23,680
Completely fabricated stories that are simply maintained by a dedicated right-wing media to ensure that the audience doesn't forget that

310
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,600
Even though they're not the topic at the moment sometime in the future. This is a group. We might need to scapegoat again

311
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,600
So while the big monologues get a lot of the attention including in this video

312
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:41,120
These smaller segments really add up to something truly nefarious the impression that these right-wing narratives are part of a persistent

313
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,080
World view one that can be maintained in the minds of viewers through constant attention not through big tentpole stories

314
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,880
These segments typically include short interviews often not running for more than two or three minutes

315
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,560
They make a perfect backdrop for how tucker carlson presents stories on his show

316
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,320
Typically, there are four reasons why a news program might include an interview

317
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,040
The first is to provide additional information to a story in his october 21st episode

318
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:11,040
Tucker carlson had a short four-minute segment on a memo issued by attorney general mary garland directing the fbi

319
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,920
To investigate the increasing number of violent threats towards school board members over covid related safety requirements fears over critical race theory

320
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,200
And other culture war narratives popularized on right-wing media

321
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:28,000
These threats are very real as there are several videos that can be found of school board meetings being disrupted by crowds of angry parents

322
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,680
Who use incendiary language including death threats have you yourself received death threats?

323
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,080
I have

324
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,080
It's terrifying

325
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,840
It has an effect on you that you can't really put into words

326
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
when someone describes

327
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,880
the way they want to

328
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,800
Come into your home

329
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:54,560
And end your life. Here's another example of parents upset that their kids might be expected to wear masks at school

330
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,640
The threats have gotten so bad that the national school boards association has requested help specifically from the fbi

331
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:11,120
But this isn't the part of the story tucker carlson shares on his show according to carlson

332
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:17,120
The controversy here is that garland did not disclose that his son-in-law runs a company called panorama education

333
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,720
Which has in a various intent panorama makes a ton of money

334
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,400
Pushing racist propaganda the kind that parents are complaining about and how does panorama education do that?

335
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,240
By creating surveys for children that measure their school experience

336
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,840
He brings on azeron omani to provide the evidence

337
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,760
They are asking children from hawaii to mean

338
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,600
What what about their sexuality their gender and they're also asking these questions of their parents

339
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:48,960
Not being someone who trusts anybody who wears a shirt that says they aren't a domestic terrorist

340
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,400
Which is exactly what a domestic terrorist not wanting to be discovered would do

341
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,440
I decided to look into these surveys myself which are helpfully posted on panorama education's website

342
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,920
Although there are multiple surveys. I couldn't find a single one asking kids about their sexuality

343
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:06,080
There was one question about gender identity though. It dared to ask a child

344
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,600
What is your gender?

345
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:14,560
But other than that there wasn't anything else on sex and gender that I could see there were definitely questions about race and culture though

346
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:21,760
specifically on pages 28 and 29 out of 56 that asks kids in grades 6 through 12 questions such as

347
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:27,200
How often do teachers encourage you to learn about people from different races ethnicities or cultures?

348
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,480
And another one is how fairly do adults at your school treat people from different races ethnicities or cultures?

349
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:38,080
Not exactly what I would call nefarious and perfectly fitting in a survey that also asks kids

350
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,480
How much support do the adults at your school give you?

351
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:46,080
And how confident are you that you can complete all the work that is assigned in your subject class?

352
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Merely asking a question about race is

353
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,240
According to nomani indoctrinating kids with critical race theory

354
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,760
These types of interviews that add additional information to a story are surprisingly rare though

355
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,400
Other interviews you might see on carlson's show are ones that add emotional context such as when a news event impacts a particular group

356
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,280
Interviewing someone from that group puts a human face on the issue providing emotional context

357
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:14,720
We'll have some better examples of that later on but the closest version of this I saw on tucker carlson tonight

358
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:21,440
Was when the show discussed the recent dave chappelle netflix special and the backlash over his comments about the trans community

359
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Tucker carlson interviewed seth dylan of the babylon b apparently for his response as a comedian

360
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,800
Another type of interview you might see on tucker carlson's show is someone with an opposing viewpoint

361
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,800
Something that has happened in the past but did not happen on the week

362
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,040
I watched and for what I can gather doesn't happen all that often on the show in general

363
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:46,340
Particularly after carlson made the mistake of inviting on dutch historian rutger bregman

364
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,480
You might not like it

365
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,700
But you're a millionaire funded by billionaires, and that's the reason why you're not talking about these issues

366
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:04,720
Yeah, only now come on you jumped a bandwagon you're all like oh i'm against a globalist the lead blah blah blah

367
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,600
It's not very convincing to be honest

368
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:13,120
Honestly if I ever get the chance to be speaking to someone like tucker carlson

369
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,520
I wanted to go down exactly like that the type of interview that is by far

370
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:24,000
The most common on tucker carlson tonight is the supposed expert who comes on to affirm everything tucker carlson has been saying

371
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,320
Given it the illusion of authority

372
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,920
Examples of this are well more than I can fit in this video

373
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,240
Here's one I enjoyed though in the october 18th episode tucker had a brief segment about an interview with christopher steel

374
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,520
Whose dossier included a number of accusations toward president trump?

375
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:46,400
Perhaps most notably the one where there's apparently a tape in vladimir putin's possession of women who trump hired to pee on a bed

376
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,800
That obama had slept in during his trip to russia

377
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:57,920
This segment itself is a rehashed complaint about how the investigation into those supposed russian connections unfairly hamstrung the trump administration's foreign policy

378
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,840
And to discuss this carlson brings on cash patel and devon nunez

379
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,040
Patel and nunez add very little of substance in their interview

380
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,520
They vaguely allude to their own personal issues

381
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,120
But the interview lasts less than three minutes giving them in only moments to answer three questions between the two of them

382
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:18,960
Their primary purpose seems to be to agree with tucker about everything and then deliver zingers like this one

383
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,760
This guy is no hero. He is no james bond

384
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,240
He's inspector gadget on pseudofed and now he's crying for the world to love him

385
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:30,480
Maybe he can get a job with the babylon b these interviews are by far the most common ones

386
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,280
I saw during the week

387
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:36,720
I watched this show figures who show up not along with everything tucker carlson said and then make a quick exit

388
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,800
Used to cap off a segment as if it now has an authoritative stamp of approval

389
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,440
That's what tucker crossing gets from these brief interviews

390
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:48,640
But I imagine the guests themselves get to expose themselves to tucker's massive audience and be presented as a friendly face

391
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,400
They can trust because they agree with the same nonsense tucker carlson spreads on his show

392
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:57,200
These are the interviews tucker carlson only conducts on his tucker carlson tonight program

393
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,080
There are other sources for people to get their tucker fix

394
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,800
And in the case of tucker carlson today

395
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,120
It's a long-form interview show that airs on the fox nation streaming service

396
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:14,560
While short segments of these interviews find their way onto tucker carlson tonight the full 50 plus minute interviews are exclusive to fox nation

397
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,120
It's here where tucker carlson really digs into the thoughts and opinions of his guests

398
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:25,200
Not like the snippets we see on his fox news show and as you might have guessed tucker's guests also enjoyed agreeing with him

399
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,160
To be fair

400
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:30,000
These interviews are absolutely in the first category of the ones I outlined above

401
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,640
As these new guests provide lots of new information relative to the narrative being offered though

402
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,960
Ultimately these discussions support the same kind of narrative tucker carlson pushes on his main show

403
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:41,280
conservative conspiracy theories

404
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:46,800
Before diving in I should note that while this show typically airs three times a week mondays wednesdays and fridays

405
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,440
Tucker carlson took october 22nd off

406
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,120
So I only have two episodes to work with though for the sake of my own sanity

407
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,360
That was an hour of tucker carlson. I was spared

408
00:33:55,680 --> 00:34:02,640
The first of the two interviews was with elbridge colby a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development

409
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,540
At the department of defense during the trump administration

410
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,240
He's a peculiar guest at least for a friendly interview considering how much of tucker carlson's branding is that he stands up to the elites

411
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,800
And insider types of washington when the interview starts tucker tries to establish that colby definitely isn't one of those people

412
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,880
If you scour the foreign policy establishment in washington, everyone's either implicated in the disasters

413
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:30,800
We're watching now or there's some kind of crazed neocon ideologue who you would not ask to babysit your children

414
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,040
Because they're that untrustworthy

415
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:39,760
So there are very few people whose opinion matters from our perspective on this topic and elbridge colby is one of them

416
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,920
Colby having some sense of the show he's on tries to do the same by claiming to have been against the war in iraq

417
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,480
But yeah, then i've been working in kind of the national security area for the last 20 years. I entered

418
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,560
Dc as a very junior guy right around the time of the iraq, you know fever before the war

419
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:01,520
And i'd say that kind of set me in one direction because I was not not a not a fan

420
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,600
I mean my opinion didn't matter at all at that time

421
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:09,440
A quick look at colby's bio reveal that he was part of the coalition provisional authority in iraq in 2003

422
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:15,920
Which was set up by the bush administration to help reshape the country and was also plagued by insider groans from washington

423
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:23,120
Something extensively written about in the 2006 book imperial life in the emerald city inside iraq's green zone by rajiv chandra

424
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:30,320
Sakaran being part of the authority that was reshaping iraq in 2003 is a curious place to be for someone who didn't support the war

425
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:35,280
After his time in iraq colby continued to work in government for a number of years and before joining the trump administration

426
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,840
Was part of the center for a new american security a think tank that is partially funded by a number of defense contractors

427
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,200
And of course the u.s

428
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,960
Government he's on tucker carlson's show to talk about the looming threat of china and how a military response might be the only option

429
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:56,240
In short colby seems like one of the washington insiders that tucker claims to have some deep resentment for but as we learn in this interview

430
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:03,220
Carlson and colby are friends and colby has a book to sell and those things are more important than the facade of tucker's anti-imperialism

431
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,600
Much of this interview is colby firing off talking points about the danger of china

432
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:12,960
And he doesn't make a terribly compelling case for his position tucker carlson is very weird in this interview

433
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,920
Although the fear mongering about china is on brand his questioning constantly reverts to the talking points

434
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,920
He usually has on his show while colby is more willing to give the typical answers

435
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,240
You'd see from a washington insider military hawk carlson keeps dredging up some of the bogus culture war narratives in response

436
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
greatest

437
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,760
adversary

438
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
was russia

439
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,000
Under vladimir putin and then biden is elected

440
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,440
And the new secretary of defense tells us that the single greatest adversaries in fact within our borders and it's white men

441
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,500
the u.s military seems demoralized

442
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:51,700
And its leadership seems completely distracted by irrelevant concerns like white rage and transgenderism

443
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:58,820
That's the outsider's perspective colby deflects a lot of these questions and comments and his tactic seems to be to constantly complement tucker and his show

444
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:04,980
And and I applaud your your focus on this issue and any institution that is above account accountability will fail

445
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:08,420
I mean, I think that's a point that you always stress and I completely agree with it. All the world

446
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,340
It's not a terribly interesting interview though

447
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:17,220
I was impressed that even in this dry discussion about american foreign policy tucker carlson still made time to insert some conspiracy theories

448
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,180
The japanese bomb for harbor. They did corregator the baton death march

449
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:26,900
They bended nurses in hong kong, etc, etc. And then we got really really angry. Well, that's where roosevelt allowed it, right?

450
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,700
He clearly did but whatever okay

451
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:37,780
I should stress that there is no evidence whatsoever that this is true

452
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:41,540
I've linked an article from npr on the subject below if you want to read more about it

453
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:47,220
And he cranks up some real fear on china by asking what one of their nukes would do to an american city modern nuclear weapons

454
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,900
Are more powerful

455
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:54,580
What kind of effect would a modern nuclear bomb have on an american population center?

456
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,060
Tucker carlson claims to be an anti-interventionist

457
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:04,580
And someone opposed to the american tendency to push itself into conflicts around the world in an effort to expand or maintain its hegemonic influence

458
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:10,900
But in this interview, he is reinforcing the very common talking point something you see in both parties about china being an existential threat

459
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:13,540
And discussing the need for a potential military response

460
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,020
It speaks to the game tucker carlson is playing claiming to be a populace speaking for americans

461
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:25,220
Specifically conservative ones who have been ignored by the republican establishment and then turning around and inviting insiders like colby on to have

462
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,540
A friendly chat about the american military possibly being in an open conflict with china

463
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:32,580
He does the same thing on tucker carlson tonight when in the week

464
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:38,340
I watched he had on politicians including senator josh holly and governor ron desantis for friendly conversations

465
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:42,900
Tucker carlson can pretend to be firmly against the neo-cons who sent the us into iraq

466
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,100
But the figureheads from back then are gone and carlson is happy to play nice with their ideological successors

467
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:51,860
While the branding of populism may be popular he'll happily cozy up to politicians

468
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:57,940
He can convince his audience represent their interests even when they clearly serve a wealthier class. It sure is helpful branding though

469
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:03,460
The other episode of tucker carlson today. I watched was far more on brand on october 20th

470
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,980
Tucker welcomed professor dorian abbott to talk about how he had recently been canceled by the woke mob

471
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:14,260
There is some backstory here in 2020 professor abbott a geophysicist at the university of chicago

472
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:21,220
Had some complaints about how diversity equity and inclusion groups were impacting the selection process for graduate student candidates and faculty hires

473
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,220
Like all reasonable academics

474
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:29,700
He voiced his concern via a youtube video since taken down which was responded to by a letter signed by over

475
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:36,020
100 students faculty and alumni calling for the university to allow students to withdraw from his classes without penalty

476
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,540
Ultimately, the university president sided with abbott and he faced no administrative disciplinary measures

477
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,500
Of course, this was not why abbott was brought on to tucker carlson's show

478
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:50,740
Most recently abbott co-wrote an article for newsweek with stanford associate professor evan marinovich once again

479
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:56,180
voicing concern about the impact of diversity equity and inclusion proposing that someone's identity

480
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,980
Should have no impact for post-secondary admissions

481
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,620
One interesting aspect of this article is that abbott briefly mentions that his proposal would also eliminate legacy admissions as well

482
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:09,620
Which is the practice of a school typically seen in elite ivy league schools

483
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:13,300
Giving students preference if they had a family member who attended the institution

484
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,380
While it's lovely to see this be mentioned

485
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:20,900
It seems strange that abbott only mentions it in passing and it comes off as a defense against people calling him racist

486
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:27,700
If anything legacy admissions seem far more unfair as it doesn't just help individuals from racial backgrounds that typically have privilege

487
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:34,020
But it goes that extra step of ensuring that someone from an already wealthy family gets special consideration for a spot at some of the best

488
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,740
Schools in the world so it discriminates based on class as well

489
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:41,460
Had abbott come out hard against legacy admissions rather than diversity admissions

490
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:46,100
We might be viewing him entirely different, but it was diversity that was his main target

491
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:52,100
In this article abbott makes no mention of the research that demonstrates how his field of geophysics is hostile towards faculty

492
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,540
That aren't white men such as himself and that there are active biases against women and non-white racial groups

493
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:02,980
And that these diversity programs are designed to undercut that bias by breaking down the systems that prevent inclusion

494
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:10,100
He also seems unaware that greater diversity within groups creates more novel hypotheses and actually expand research potential not limit it

495
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:16,980
Professor abbott seems to be under the impression that science faculties are untouched by these biases and exist in realms of pure reason

496
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:21,860
Where facts and evidence are all that matter and a person's identity couldn't possibly impact their work

497
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:25,860
He seems unaware of the academic research that undermined this idea

498
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,340
Which is strange because those studies that you saw flash on screen as I was talking about those topics

499
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,060
Were all included in the letter complaining about him in 2020

500
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:37,780
It's almost as if he either didn't read them or simply has no interest in acknowledging them

501
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:43,220
That aside what probably drew the most attention in this article is this passage towards the end 90 years ago

502
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:49,380
Germany had the best universities in the world then an ideological regime obsessed with race came to power and drove many of the best

503
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:54,980
Scholars out cutting the faculties and leading to sustained decay that german universities never fully recovered from

504
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:01,060
We should view this as a warning of the consequences of viewing group membership as more important than merit and correct our course

505
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:02,580
Before it is too late

506
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:06,500
If professor abbott is interested in starting a conversation about university admissions

507
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:11,620
I'm not sure comparing diversity equity and inclusion programs to the nazis is a helpful talking point

508
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:17,700
Also, there's something truly grotesque about comparing an effort to help marginalized peoples have better access to higher education

509
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:20,900
With the effort from nazis to keep those groups out of universities

510
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:26,500
It seems more like the exact opposite of what's going on anyone can make grossly reductive points like this

511
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:31,940
I could say the allies in world war ii were just like the nazis because when they were at war both militaries killed soldiers on

512
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:36,260
The opposite side, but that would be a silly comparison that removes all nuance from the discussion

513
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,900
But maybe tucker carlson will bring this up in the interview

514
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:44,980
Except no, definitely not we're gonna get stuff like this instead. I don't think i've ever seen a college professor

515
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:48,980
Lay out in such clear and I will say gentle

516
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:53,700
Terms, um as you did what's at stake?

517
00:42:54,020 --> 00:43:00,020
I'm not sure a nazi comparison is all that gentle the rest of the interview goes the way you might expect with tucker praising abbott

518
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:07,320
At every turn and some questionable responses being treated as a matter of fact, for example, professor abbott complains about certain ideologies

519
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,780
I was uncomfortable with

520
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:15,940
With ideologies that discourage discourse because when you can't speak with the other side

521
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:21,060
The only recourse is violence. Yes, and I saw that playing out in the summer of 2020

522
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:23,220
This is a weird comment

523
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:28,100
Obviously the summer of 2020 refers to the black lives matter demonstrations and in other contexts

524
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:31,940
It could be generously understood as violence in response to an indifferent state

525
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:36,980
That doesn't care about the impact of harsh policing on black communities and won't have that difficult conversation

526
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,780
But in the context of this interview with tucker carlson

527
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:46,100
It is more like a condemnation of black lives matter for not wanting to talk about their problems instead of resorting to violence

528
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,460
Putting aside the fact that the violence in blm protest has been grossly overstated by the media

529
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:58,020
The only way someone can assume black people don't want to talk about the violence inflicted upon them by the state is to deliberately ignore that conversation

530
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,860
Which has been happening for a very long time and has been conveniently ignored by people such as professor abbott

531
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,540
It's a great example of how someone like professor abbott was completely ignorant of a problem until it boiled over into a mass movement

532
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:16,020
And even now his response is that we need to think even less about the negative impact of the social construct of race

533
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:19,700
This is not the mindset of someone ready for a conversation

534
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:22,820
Except when it's with tucker carlson in a softball interview

535
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:27,940
The interview muddles along and I feel like I could spend a whole hour on how so many of these answers are wrapped up

536
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:31,140
In gentle language but reveal a deep ignorance of the many issues at play

537
00:44:31,380 --> 00:44:35,300
But I want to once again mention how conspiracy theories rear their ugly head

538
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:40,980
Here's professor abbott talking about who's really behind all this diversity stuff. But the problem is that there's a small group

539
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,700
That's extremely committed

540
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,980
You could call them the woke activist or the social justice

541
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,940
Justice activist and they're willing to spend all their time on this stuff and they sort of steamroll

542
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:55,380
And there's some kind of twitter mob that organize in this as well

543
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,180
There's there's almost like a playbook

544
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:01,940
To try to take someone down who disagrees with the ideology

545
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:05,380
so the first thing that happens is people go on twitter

546
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:09,380
And they organize and they write lots of messages about the person

547
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:15,940
And the messages say mean things so they'll say this is racist bigoted white supremacists like very

548
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:23,780
Scary sounding things the idea that some people have genuine criticisms of him and are simply responding to his words doesn't seem to occur to him

549
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:27,380
He just waves it away as some kind of conspiracy to advance the fourth rank

550
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,540
This interview isn't strictly about the newsweek article getting some criticism though

551
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:36,660
Professor abbott is a victim in all of this because he was about to deliver a guest lecture at mit

552
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:42,900
But was disinvited because of the blowback of that article abbott's response is slightly telling in this interview

553
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,780
Uh only the top people in the field are invited

554
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,300
To do this you give a large public lecture for like 500 people

555
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:56,660
And then you visit the department at mit about your research about a outreach level of your research

556
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:58,580
It sounds like this lecture was a big deal

557
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:00,900
But what is this outreach level comment?

558
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,940
It turns out that this lecture at mit was intended not strictly for faculty or university students

559
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:08,020
But also for high school students

560
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:14,660
robert vander hilst head of mit's earth atmospheric and planetary sciences department clarified in a statement

561
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,180
The carlson lecture isn't a scientific talk for fellow scientists

562
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:24,900
It has a very specific format and public outreach component seeking to build public understanding of climate science and to inspire and engage with

563
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:30,980
Area high school students. We felt that with the current distractions. We would not be in a position to hold an effective outreach event

564
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:35,460
I made this decision at my discretion after consulting with faculty and students in the department

565
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:41,540
And knowing that some might mistake it as an affront on academic freedom a characterization. I do not agree with though

566
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:48,900
This particular lecture was cancelled mit did invite professor abbott to give another lecture this one instead with faculty and university students

567
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:53,860
This isn't a case of someone being cancelled. It's a case of someone's lecture being rescheduled

568
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:57,860
But that's not the narrative we see on tucker carlson's show. It's a way to cripple someone's

569
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:02,180
A scientific career and put pressure on them not to speak out

570
00:47:02,340 --> 00:47:07,460
I don't know how speaking to high school students would mean more for his career than presenting his research to practicing academics

571
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:14,020
But there's one more aspect of this interview that was very informative after abbott had that letter written about him in 2020

572
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:18,340
The minor controversy that followed drew the attention of many supposed free speech groups

573
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:23,780
Apparently abbott suddenly found himself networking with a number of different groups and individuals ready to champion his cause

574
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:28,420
That the worst thing that happened to him was a letter didn't matter. They welcomed him into their fold

575
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:34,420
I was already a part of the heterodox academy. I got involved with fire foundation for individual rights and education

576
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:39,460
I I met with some of the leadership at acta the american council of trustees and alumni

577
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:45,140
I started networking and trying to understand what had happened and how I can be effective

578
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:51,700
He unironically calls this a group of classical liberals and even mentions how they set up a little safe space for themselves

579
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,940
They have controversial speakers

580
00:47:54,340 --> 00:48:00,180
And it's the faculty. It's only faculty who attend by invitation only so everyone can trust who's there

581
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,660
And as is typical with these conversations

582
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:06,580
We see tucker carlson and professor abbott pat themselves on the back for having a conversation

583
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:12,820
Even though they might disagree on some stuff and you speaking to me is not the same as ratifying all of my different

584
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,100
Exactly crazy opinions which you may disagree with but that's not the point if you didn't talk to everyone you disagreed with something on

585
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:19,700
You wouldn't talk to anyone, right?

586
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:26,180
It's like this program turned into an episode of the ruben report where the hapless dave ruben happily nods along with whatever right-wing

587
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:28,420
Goal he's invited onto his show only in this case

588
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:34,260
It's a bit more sophisticated with tucker carlson bringing on a sympathetic face to advance similar talking points

589
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:40,420
And he's actually capable of marching to the same beat alongside with them instead of vacuously nodding his head like dave ruben

590
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:45,460
I hate how hollow the whole comment about how they can disagree about things but still talk to one another

591
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:50,020
At no point in this interview did the two of them have any sort of meaningful disagreement about anything

592
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,940
It's the same line dave ruben would have about not having to agree with all his guests

593
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:59,460
If there is no active airing of these disagreements in this case tucker carlson doesn't even bring them up

594
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:06,180
Then this is just platforming ideas with no pushback. The invisible disagreements don't matter because they're not talking about them

595
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,860
These are two people who agree about everything they're discussing in this interview

596
00:49:10,100 --> 00:49:15,300
Their disagreements could be about fundamental policy issues or what kind of potato chip they like to eat

597
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,460
It doesn't matter. We don't see it

598
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:21,300
Professor abbott not only faced the horror of having his mit lecture rescheduled

599
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:26,500
He was also rewarded with an additional lecture at princeton, which so far has over 10 000 viewers registered

600
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,020
Which is a lot more than the 500 he expected at his first mit lecture

601
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:36,020
The interview ends on an optimistic note that really reinforces the idea that this man has in no meaningful way been cancelled

602
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:40,420
That there is an entire apparatus ready to make him the next darling of the free speech crowd

603
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,220
He might make the rounds on exclusively right-wing shows talking about the left being out of control

604
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,180
And if he plays his car, right maybe he'll get a job at the blaze or maybe we'll never hear about this guy again

605
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:56,900
Because to be perfectly honest guys like this have limited appeal their tools to talk about the phantom menace of cancel culture

606
00:49:56,980 --> 00:50:00,020
It's really just the media savvy ones who can parlay that into a career

607
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,260
I don't know if this guy has it in him for that

608
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:05,620
Remember when I said about how I got lucky that tucker took friday off

609
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:10,980
Well that luck ran out when I learned that he also dropped an extra bit of content onto fox nation

610
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:18,180
One of his monthly tucker carlson originals this one titled blown away the people versus wind power as you might have guessed

611
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:25,700
It's about how wind power is a threat to america this 25 minute special which calls itself a documentary is so thin and cheesy

612
00:50:25,780 --> 00:50:27,620
I struggle to take it seriously

613
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:33,060
It's lavishly produced and leans very heavily on interviews that give emotional context to the supposed threat of wind power

614
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:35,300
That's the second type of interview. I mentioned above

615
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:42,420
The vast majority of subjects are either regular people or activists upset that wind turbines have been or are being built near them

616
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,340
Here's an example people who look at some of these wind proposals

617
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:49,620
Figure out quickly that one of the reasons their community is being targeted

618
00:50:49,860 --> 00:50:52,740
Is it's poor and they're perceived as being desperate for revenue

619
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:57,220
This sure seems like a case of the little guy being troubled by big business. So let's see who we meet first

620
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:04,180
The consequence of this affluent nimbyism is that the high cost of green energy falls on poorer places

621
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:07,860
Places like rural, iowa home to mike and tanya lamb

622
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:10,500
I'm not sure what property values are like in iowa

623
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:15,380
But there is no way that anyone living in that home is one of the poorer and desperate described earlier

624
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:19,300
Tanya lamb who lives in the house literally calls it her dream home

625
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,660
It is our dream home

626
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,660
The special is a collection of shots of windmills breaking up otherwise flat scenery

627
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:28,100
And if you're guessing many of these complaints about windmills is that they will ruin the view

628
00:51:28,580 --> 00:51:30,580
You'd be right in 2019

629
00:51:31,140 --> 00:51:33,860
The wind farms came this is our view from our dinner table

630
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,980
Turbines every direction and you know, we get a lot of shadow flicker in here, too

631
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:44,420
I mean just imagine being in a room and someone's turning the light switch on and off on and off on and off

632
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:49,140
I mean and this it's in the middle of the day. Well, it's actually the morning is when it's the worst and

633
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,020
It I mean it almost makes you dizzy

634
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,860
There are some other assorted complaints like the wind turbine creates a lot of noise

635
00:51:56,020 --> 00:52:02,580
And the only time we hear noise from a turbine is when we get one of these weird close-ups where audio is almost certainly being manipulated

636
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:04,980
Our peaceful country living

637
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:11,380
That isn't to say that these things are completely silent and I suppose whatever noise might be generated is annoying

638
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,620
Anyone can find plenty of these complaints online

639
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:18,900
But a problem with this criticism is that it's couched in the idea that these wind turbines are in rural areas

640
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:24,340
Because people in cities don't want the burden that comes with building them. That is supposedly the noise they create

641
00:52:24,820 --> 00:52:30,340
As someone who currently lives in a city that is one of the most ridiculous things i've ever heard as I type this

642
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:34,660
I can hear a plane flying overhead as it approaches the city's airport 30 minutes ago

643
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:37,380
There was a siren as an ambulance drove by and a few days ago

644
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,700
I spent most of the day listening to a construction crew repair a water main down the street for me

645
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:45,860
We get noise in the city the occasional whooshing noise would not be a big deal

646
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:51,380
The reason you don't see a lot of wind turbines in cities is because they're more effective in wide open spaces

647
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:56,020
Such as coastal areas or open planes if you live somewhere like a flat part of iowa

648
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:58,420
That's what makes it an attractive spot for a wind turbine

649
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,100
When is it nearly strong enough when the turbine is surrounded by buildings?

650
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:10,340
We get some laughable complaints about how subsidies are used to create wind farms wind farms only exist because they're heavily subsidized by

651
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:17,220
Politicians with your money. They wouldn't exist. Otherwise, there's no mention at all of subsidies that go towards fossil fuel companies

652
00:53:17,620 --> 00:53:19,620
This is where the special really drops the ball

653
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:26,680
Any discussion about energy needs would of course mention that there is always a cost associated with them both financial and environmental

654
00:53:27,140 --> 00:53:29,140
And while wind turbines have one

655
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,420
Comparatively their cost is lower than that of fossil fuels

656
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:38,900
An article in nature describes the amount of spent on fossil fuel subsidies as more than triple what is spent on renewables like wind energy

657
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:42,580
It's irresponsible to discuss these subsidies without presenting that context

658
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:47,860
But it certainly doesn't end there what really annoyed me in the specials when it got personal and tucker tried to use the birds

659
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:55,060
To push his agenda from the federal government and other studies that show that hundreds of thousands of birds are killed every year

660
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:59,460
By wind turbines again a comparison needs to be made here every year

661
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,380
Far more birds are killed by power lines buildings and cats than wind turbines

662
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:07,700
And if we're going to reduce this discussion to energy production fossil fuels are driving climate change

663
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:14,660
Which will and does have a dramatic impact on bird habitats devastating populations and threatening entire species with extinction

664
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:18,340
This isn't to say that we shouldn't consider birds when building windmills

665
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,300
Particularly species that are more likely to be impacted by them

666
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:25,860
And this can be addressed by considering migration patterns and habitats when it comes to placing windmills

667
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:29,860
But climate change is by far the bigger threat and if someone truly cares about the birds

668
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:33,300
Fossil fuels are a much greater danger to birds than windmills

669
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:35,460
There is very little to comment on in this special

670
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:40,420
We spend some time with a fisherman worried about his business failing because of wind turbines that haven't been built yet

671
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:46,900
And activists who say that wind turbines would mean new york has changed its political composition this state. It's not a democracy

672
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:53,380
It's the socialist republic. Oh, it might be fun to just dunk on these people providing evidence that building windmills around water

673
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,500
Typically has no meaningful impact on fish populations

674
00:54:56,660 --> 00:55:01,780
Or when this guy holds up a map to demonstrate that new york state would never build wind turbines near new york city

675
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:08,100
Is completely contradicted by the fact that there is the empire wind project an offshore wind farm being built right next to new york city

676
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,260
That is planned for completion in 2026

677
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:14,020
Ultimately, this is the smallest of potatoes being presented

678
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:21,060
The previous tucker carlson original special to air was about ufos if you're in a series that includes a special about the dangers of ufos

679
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:22,740
I hate to break it to you

680
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,740
But you're not on a serious program

681
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:29,300
And so we come to the end of our odyssey through the many programs of tucker carlson

682
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:35,060
And this was all from a single week what I found most surprising about this venture was how diverse tucker's talking points were

683
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:39,940
He truly had something for everyone. He had conspiracy theories of all flavors. He had racism

684
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:44,600
He had sexism transphobia anti-semitism neo-con republicanism and religiosity

685
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:51,700
Part of my research included trips to the facebook page for tucker carlson tonight where clips of the opening monologues were often shared

686
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,780
And the comments were completely uninteresting

687
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:59,060
Some I guess i'll call them highlights include if we the people want to keep our freedom

688
00:55:59,300 --> 00:56:01,780
We must stand up and not submit to the mandates

689
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:03,300
We must push back

690
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:08,420
We must ask the one and only true god to have mercy on us and shine the light of truth on the evil

691
00:56:08,420 --> 00:56:13,540
Being played out right in front of us. No wonder the left hates tucker carlson. He mops the floor with them

692
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:16,340
every single night

693
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,580
With the exception of the colon pal monologue

694
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:23,380
Which sparked a bit of debate between those who respect his position and those who hate his disapproval of donald trump

695
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:27,140
The comments are mostly filled with screeds against democrats and adulation for tucker

696
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,820
No one is watching the show critically. They're coming here to have their biases served

697
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,340
This observation I imagine will shock no one nor will my debunking of tucker carlson's content

698
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,580
His program has long been understood as a pack of lies used to push far-right talking points

699
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:46,420
But by washing it for a week what surprised me was how artificial it all felt so obviously rehearsed. Here's a quick example

700
00:56:46,660 --> 00:56:51,140
Like white privilege family privilege is an unacknowledged and unearned benefit

701
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,900
Instantiated if that's even a word these people are so stupid

702
00:56:54,900 --> 00:57:01,940
Instantiated in u.s. Law's policies and practices just right like an american for the benefit of tucker according to oxford

703
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,900
Instantiated means to represent as or by an instance. It's a little examples like these that exemplify or

704
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:16,100
Instantiate the somewhat folksy attitude tucker presents on a show much like the rolled up sleeves and wood paneling on his today program

705
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:19,620
Or the photo ops he does in his definitely real and not at all staged

706
00:57:19,620 --> 00:57:25,540
Cabinsque room tucker carlson's audience have bought into this fiction of him being a man of the people even though he comes from

707
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,260
A wealthy background and continues to make millions on fox news

708
00:57:28,420 --> 00:57:32,340
pushing hollow narratives designed to misinform and distract his audience from the fact that he

709
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,540
And people like him are actively working against their interests

710
00:57:35,700 --> 00:57:39,860
It speaks to the problem of personalities in political commentary people aren't tuning in for the news

711
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,460
They're tuning in to see tucker

712
00:57:41,460 --> 00:57:45,140
He gives them a version of the world they want to believe in so they outsource their thinking to him

713
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:48,340
And he shapes the news of the day into a version that confirms their biases

714
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:55,060
Whether it's distracting them with bogus stories about menacing refugee children or misinforming them about vaccines that will save their lives

715
00:57:55,220 --> 00:58:01,060
The objective is to rile people up and make them angry with empty narratives and then direct them towards republican politicians

716
00:58:01,140 --> 00:58:05,940
Will devote more money to the military and undermine projects that might benefit the american people

717
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:12,260
The interview with retcord bragman summed it up perfectly when he called tucker carlson a millionaire working for billionaires

718
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:18,340
And that is why that segment never saw the light of day on tucker's show and we only have evidence since bragman recorded it himself

719
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:23,780
Tucker carlson needs that facade to keep this whole thing going. It's not about standing up to the powerful elites

720
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:28,020
It's about distracting the people with nonsense so they don't notice those same elites exploiting them

721
00:58:28,340 --> 00:58:31,720
That is what tucker carlson does with his programming each week

722
00:58:34,740 --> 00:58:39,300
This one was quite a ride tucker carlson's show really spins your head around

723
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:44,980
Just constantly firing off information at you daring you to even try and understand it

724
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:50,020
If I wanted to debunk every claim he made on his show this video would have been like five or six hours

725
00:58:50,340 --> 00:58:56,900
It's the eternal problem of debunking videos where the truth takes so much longer to explain than the lie that is repeated so easily

726
00:58:57,380 --> 00:59:00,260
