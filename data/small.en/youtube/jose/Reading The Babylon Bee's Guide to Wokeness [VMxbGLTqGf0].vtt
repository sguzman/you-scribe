00:00.400 --> 00:06.080
Conservative comedy is having a weird moment. Right now it has a strange dynamic where it only

00:06.080 --> 00:10.880
makes sense in the context of two competing audiences. One, a left-wing audience that is

00:10.880 --> 00:15.200
supposedly offended or outraged at everything, and the conservative audience laughing at that

00:15.200 --> 00:20.480
outrage. Many conservative comedians play to this dynamic not by telling good or even legible jokes,

00:20.480 --> 00:24.800
but instead emphasizing how much they're bothering the other side. For an example of this,

00:24.800 --> 00:31.680
let's look at James Delingpole's 2011 book, 365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy. The introduction

00:31.680 --> 00:36.080
opens with as good a primer as I've seen. Liberals are easy meat for conservatives for

00:36.080 --> 00:41.920
several good reasons. One, liberals have no sense of humor. Two, liberals have no facts on their

00:41.920 --> 00:48.720
side. Three, liberals are hypocrites. Four, God, being conservative himself, hates liberalism at

00:48.720 --> 00:53.840
least as much as you do, which is why he created reasons one, two, and three. And here's one of

00:53.840 --> 01:01.040
the jokes. Always refer in pitting, sympathetic tones to the liberal psychopathology. This

01:01.040 --> 01:07.040
implies that liberalism is a form of mental illness, which it is. That's a joke that got

01:07.040 --> 01:12.960
published in a book. Personally, it didn't drive me crazy. Maybe that's because I'm not a liberal,

01:12.960 --> 01:17.680
but I'm not sure it would drive a liberal crazy either. It's such a weak milquetoast jab that I

01:17.680 --> 01:22.480
can't imagine anyone really being bothered by this. Maybe the joke where liberals are called

01:22.480 --> 01:27.600
Nazis would bother someone, but it's so wordy and clumsy it doesn't really hit. That's one of

01:27.600 --> 01:32.560
the weirdest parts about conservative humor right now. It requires an imagined premise to make sense.

01:32.560 --> 01:37.920
That imagined premise being an audience of easily offended left-wing people. And with that imagined

01:37.920 --> 01:41.920
audience in mind as the target, conservative comedians put very little effort into making

01:41.920 --> 01:46.960
jokes that are actually funny. Here's an example from Gutfeld, a late-night conservative comedy

01:47.280 --> 02:04.160
hosted by Greg Gutfeld. It's not the strongest gesture of faith in your joke when you take a

02:04.160 --> 02:08.880
moment to explain it to the audience. This whole opening monologue is responding to the mainstream

02:08.880 --> 02:13.680
media pointing out how unfunny one of Gutfeld's jokes is, and he farms that for several minutes

02:13.760 --> 02:18.320
of weak jokes that are hitting back against the mainstream media. Things aren't much better on

02:18.320 --> 02:23.040
YouTube with the likes of JP Sears basically making the same joke in every video where he acts as

02:23.040 --> 02:29.680
though he's just discovered sarcasm. I can say, hand on heart, honest to Karl Marx, mandates are

02:29.680 --> 02:35.600
indeed the path to freedom. So could we all please just quit being skeptical so we don't fall into

02:35.600 --> 02:41.200
the dangerous trap of thinking for ourselves? That small example is pretty much this guy's

02:41.200 --> 02:46.160
entire comedy shtick in a nutshell. He does this sarcastic impression of some imagined person on

02:46.160 --> 02:51.120
the left. And by the left, by the way, this can mean everything from moderate politicians and

02:51.120 --> 02:55.120
media outlets to activists on the street fighting for social change. Because in the world of

02:55.120 --> 02:59.600
conservative comedy, wanting to give blankets to the homeless and abolishing nation-states are

02:59.600 --> 03:06.240
basically the same thing. It's all just the left. None of this stuff is clever or nuanced satire.

03:06.240 --> 03:11.200
It's just lazy references to imagined other, expressing anger and hatred rather than humor.

03:11.200 --> 03:15.440
And there's no worse offender of this than the Babylon Bee. In a video of what they claim are

03:15.440 --> 03:20.800
their best sketches of 2021, you have to stop voicing your opinions or that thing will kill us.

03:22.800 --> 03:27.040
I agree with Martin Luther King Jr. that we should judge someone by the content of their character

03:27.040 --> 03:30.560
and not by the color of their skin. You just got us killed!

03:31.520 --> 03:35.200
I judge everything through the lens of rage!

03:35.200 --> 03:40.080
All their humor is basically the slam cartoon, over and over again. All of this is probably

03:40.080 --> 03:43.440
just review because I'm sure a lot of you saw that some more news video about conservative

03:43.440 --> 03:47.600
comedy, but I was curious what it would be like to really engage with a single piece

03:47.600 --> 03:52.880
of conservative comedy media. And knowing what I would be in for, I decided that piece would be

03:52.880 --> 03:58.640
the Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness. And in this case, I guess the only joke here is on me.

03:59.280 --> 04:03.200
This book is presented in the tradition of other comedy outlets needing to sell some stuff.

04:03.200 --> 04:07.760
The Daily Show had its textbook parodies, America, The Book, and Earth, The Book. The

04:07.760 --> 04:12.880
Colbert Report had I Am America and So Can You and America Again. And The Onion has published

04:12.880 --> 04:17.760
over 10 different books ranging from original content to reprints of previously published work.

04:17.760 --> 04:22.000
The Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness presents itself as a humorous book looking at what

04:22.000 --> 04:26.320
wokeness really means and how it works in the real world. And while it's largely an excuse

04:26.320 --> 04:30.960
to tell some bad jokes, it does expect, at least to some degree, to be taken seriously.

04:30.960 --> 04:34.880
In an interview with the Heartland Institute, Babylon Bee managing editor and co-author of

04:34.880 --> 04:43.280
this book, Joel Barry, explained. We wanted a kind of a light, silly critique that is substantive.

04:43.280 --> 04:51.040
You know, we did our research and we wanted to make it accurate and insightful. He doesn't

04:51.040 --> 04:55.360
describe everything he's read on the subject, but he does name check one person. Have a guess at

04:55.360 --> 04:59.680
which of these two people they went to further research. It's a much more dynamic and complicated

04:59.680 --> 05:04.480
relationship than you're talking about. And as far as sort of structures that, again, you're making

05:04.480 --> 05:07.760
a connection between structures in terms of institutional structures that I was talking about

05:07.760 --> 05:11.120
and the particular type of structures that, say, a salsora would be talking about in terms of

05:11.120 --> 05:14.480
structuralism. That's not actually what I was talking about. And that's not what most people

05:14.480 --> 05:17.680
are talking about when they talk about systems and structures. Again, that's a very tight

05:17.680 --> 05:22.160
correlation you draw. But if we were to accept that correlation, then sure. But it's not only

05:22.160 --> 05:26.320
that we're not accepting it, it's actually not what we're talking about. And postmodernism, again,

05:26.320 --> 05:32.160
plays upon a range of things. I'm sorry? I said, you know, a lot about this, actually.

05:32.160 --> 05:37.680
It was noted sword dancer James Lindsay, who the Babylon be cited as an expert on wokeness. Maybe

05:37.680 --> 05:42.320
they also looked up Mark Lamont Hill, but reading this book, it has the same forced misunderstandings

05:42.320 --> 05:48.000
of its subject that Lindsay has. For example, in James Lindsay's mind, the term inclusion

05:48.000 --> 05:54.000
is a communism. Covid policy is a communism. And justice is also a communism. Everything is

05:54.000 --> 05:58.560
communism. If wokeness is a buzzword that means whatever conservatives are trying to vilify,

05:58.560 --> 06:03.120
Lindsay is a great source for that. Each section of this book is dedicated to goofing on and

06:03.120 --> 06:07.600
explaining left-wing perspectives on culture war issues such as race and gender. And before we go

06:07.600 --> 06:12.880
into detail, let's take care of something incredibly obvious right away. This book does indeed

06:12.880 --> 06:18.000
make use of the one joke. For those that don't know, the one joke is a transphobic remark where

06:18.000 --> 06:23.680
someone says they identify as something abstract, mocking anyone who identifies with a particular

06:23.680 --> 06:28.080
gender that differs from one that they were assigned at birth. Here's an example from this

06:28.080 --> 06:34.240
book. Batman is extremely insensitive to people who identify as bats. That's what the jokes are

06:34.240 --> 06:38.800
going to be like. Get ready for more of that. While the Babylon be is certainly not below making that

06:38.800 --> 06:43.440
joke non-stop, as you can see from their second most popular video on YouTube, this book is

06:43.440 --> 06:48.720
surprisingly light on the one joke. In fact, it instead recycles a number of jokes. An early

06:48.720 --> 06:54.720
example is in the introduction of this book where we get this. I think game? Though it doesn't really

06:54.720 --> 06:58.080
have any rules for what you're supposed to do with those folks in the road. So I'm not sure if this

06:58.080 --> 07:03.040
is supposed to be a game or some kind of flowchart for how your life's gonna go. The ironic finish

07:03.040 --> 07:08.240
here is avoiding becoming red-pilled so you can be woke. The most common non-ending space, aside

07:08.240 --> 07:13.440
from blank spaces where they didn't bother coming up with a joke, is the phrase, scream at sky. That

07:13.440 --> 07:19.600
is a reference to this image. This was from a 2017 clip of someone expressing their anguish over

07:19.600 --> 07:24.320
Donald Trump being elected president, and it has been used endlessly since then to mock people on

07:24.320 --> 07:29.280
the left who aren't particularly fond of Donald Trump being the president. And if you think my

07:29.280 --> 07:34.160
jump here is a little unfair, assuming this text refers to this particular image, the book helpfully

07:34.160 --> 07:39.760
uses this exact phrase as a label for this exact image when it makes the same joke a little later

07:39.760 --> 07:46.160
on. And of course this image appears in the book again and again and again. Here's something to

07:46.160 --> 07:51.040
consider. Was joke funnier the third time or the fifth time? Or maybe it was never that funny,

07:51.040 --> 07:55.440
but it does signify a person that the right is supposed to laugh at, and pointing out an angry

07:55.440 --> 08:00.800
person on the left is more important than creating original or funny jokes, or in this case a joke at

08:00.800 --> 08:06.400
all. This is just pointing at a person and laughing because they're upset. In addition to mocking the

08:06.400 --> 08:11.280
left, this book also smugly acts as though it owns all the facts, and it makes this joke multiple

08:11.280 --> 08:16.640
times. One of its favorite ways of doing that is by stating that 2 plus 2 equals 4, symbolizing how

08:16.640 --> 08:22.240
the left denies obvious facts like this one. This is another joke they make many times in this book,

08:22.240 --> 08:28.080
many, many times. The book doesn't really trade in hard facts though. Most of the basic facts in

08:28.080 --> 08:32.960
this book it does get right, but it's usually the bare minimum of understanding how the world

08:32.960 --> 08:38.880
works, and it certainly miscounts the left so badly that it's virtually unrecognizable. For example,

08:38.880 --> 08:43.520
here's an excerpt from the chapter on American history. The Civil Rights Movement was the worst

08:43.520 --> 08:48.480
thing to happen in America since slavery. In it, a right-wing, left-wing communist Christian

08:48.480 --> 08:53.440
revolutionary liberator and white nationalist named Martin Luther King Jr. encouraged everyone

08:53.440 --> 08:59.520
to judge people by their character instead of the color of their skin. Not very woke, MLK. He also

08:59.520 --> 09:04.560
advocated for desegregation, which caused whiteness to poison the safe spaces black Americans had

09:04.560 --> 09:10.320
worked so hard to build. Tragic. Obviously the joke here is that this is how the modern left

09:10.320 --> 09:15.200
supposedly reads history, incoherent and backwards. Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent figure in

09:15.200 --> 09:20.880
the Civil Rights Movement, obviously. That is one of the few facts that this book couldn't possibly

09:20.880 --> 09:25.280
get wrong, and those are the only facts it really tries to present, never going past anything more

09:25.280 --> 09:31.040
complicated than 2 plus 2 equals 4. On occasion, it does go out on a limb, such as in the science

09:31.040 --> 09:35.920
section where it mistakes gender and sex, to back up its claim that the left is attacking biology,

09:35.920 --> 09:40.400
but that's about as far as it'll go at approaching any fact that might confuse a person over the age

09:40.400 --> 09:45.040
of 10. It also reveals the depth at which they understand any of the topics they're talking about.

09:45.040 --> 09:49.040
They might get basic facts that any child could understand right, and then fails completely

09:49.040 --> 09:53.120
because they have no real understanding of the facts that are being discussed or how the other

09:53.120 --> 09:58.080
side even sees them. Let's go back to the MLK passage though. This is also making an implicit

09:58.080 --> 10:02.560
fact claim behind this joke, that the left doesn't understand the message of Martin Luther King Jr.

10:02.560 --> 10:07.280
and are instead perverting it to fit some kind of woke agenda. It's the sort of thing you would

10:07.280 --> 10:12.320
hear on Fox News, ignoring the radical politics of MLK, such as his support for union movements

10:12.320 --> 10:17.280
or opposing American imperialism. This book has a very bland, watered down, great school version

10:17.280 --> 10:21.280
in mind when it speaks of Martin Luther King Jr., presenting him as a man who wanted people to be

10:21.280 --> 10:26.560
less judgmental and not advocate for social justice. Its jokes and humor only work if you're

10:26.560 --> 10:31.520
completely ignorant of the subjects they're talking about. The book spends a lot of time complaining

10:31.520 --> 10:37.760
about the violence at BLM protests, often casting BLM and Antifa as the villains. For it to turn

10:37.760 --> 10:42.960
around with this nonsense as though they're the ones truly venerating Martin Luther King Jr.

10:42.960 --> 10:48.160
is a bit strange. Here's what he said about violent protests back in the 1967 speech,

10:48.160 --> 10:56.480
the other America. I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air.

10:57.600 --> 11:06.000
Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously

11:06.880 --> 11:13.680
as we condemn riots, but in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard.

11:14.560 --> 11:18.720
The Babylon Bee takes violence at Black Lives Matter demonstrations as the perfect chance to

11:18.720 --> 11:24.720
compare demonstrators in BLM to the Ku Klux Klan, and then makes a joke about Satan being a part of

11:24.720 --> 11:30.480
BLM. And they do all of this while pretending to revere the civil rights movements of the 1960s.

11:30.480 --> 11:34.160
I guess this is the part where the joke is supposed to be making the left angry. Obviously,

11:34.160 --> 11:39.120
this is an offensive thing. But when you look at these jokes, would you have been upset had I not

11:39.120 --> 11:44.320
explain the context here? And that's where they fail. This very lame graphic of Satan being in

11:44.320 --> 11:50.080
BLM is so boring that when I read it the first time, it barely elicited an eye roll. You really

11:50.080 --> 11:55.200
have to take a moment to consider the context and think about these jokes to realize the racism on

11:55.200 --> 12:00.000
display here. One of the failures of this book is that it does say some offensive stuff, but it's

12:00.000 --> 12:04.800
so lazy and uninspired that it can't even get that offended reaction without some left-wing

12:04.800 --> 12:09.280
YouTuber taking a few minutes to explain the context of why this joke is so offensive. If you

12:09.280 --> 12:14.400
need me to do the job of angering the left over your lame comedy, you're failing pretty hard at

12:14.400 --> 12:19.120
it. The guys at the Babylon Bee get their guffaws from how the mainstream media sometimes fact

12:19.120 --> 12:24.080
checks their work. They assume this is because the left is too stupid to notice that it's satire,

12:24.080 --> 12:28.560
which isn't really the case. Part of the reason it needs to be fact checked is because,

12:28.560 --> 12:32.720
to some degree, their own audience believes some of this stuff is true. Here are some real

12:32.720 --> 12:36.720
reviews I found of the book from its Goodreads page. I've been doing a fair amount of reading

12:36.720 --> 12:42.720
and research on wokeness recently as I'm teaching a bible class on the topic for my congregation,

12:42.720 --> 12:47.280
and as I say, I was particularly struck by the fact that the Bee's Guide to Wokeness,

12:47.280 --> 12:52.080
for all its humorous parody and satire, offers a pretty good summary overview of what wokeness

12:52.080 --> 12:57.840
really is and entails. It's so funny because it is so true. Defining and explaining wokeness is

12:57.840 --> 13:02.560
extremely funny because it is nonsensical. This should replace many college textbooks.

13:02.560 --> 13:07.280
It would be cheaper and much more direct. Be prepared to be hashtag more woke. Yes,

13:07.280 --> 13:12.080
it's hashtag satire, so this is a funny and, sadly too often, true book.

13:12.720 --> 13:17.440
In research done by Ohio State University, they found that not only are right-wing readers more

13:17.440 --> 13:21.840
likely to believe ideas that the Babylon Bee packages as satire, they're more likely to believe

13:21.840 --> 13:26.960
them than left-wing audiences will believe a satirical story from The Onion. The Babylon Bee

13:26.960 --> 13:31.200
has fired back at this study, claiming it to be flawed in that it didn't present the headlines

13:31.200 --> 13:35.680
of its stories verbatim, but the story used the same technique for The Onion headlines,

13:35.680 --> 13:40.800
and it also misses the point being made. What this study reveals is that right-wing audiences

13:40.800 --> 13:45.520
are more prone to see truth in this type of satire. It's not unlike how certain audiences

13:45.520 --> 13:50.000
would look at sitcom characters such as Archie Bunker or Al Bundy as heroes when they were

13:50.000 --> 13:54.720
supposed to be mocked. At least in those cases, though, the jokes were actually funny.

13:54.720 --> 13:57.440
Also, if you want to learn about Al Bundy being a hero, check out my video on Married

13:57.440 --> 14:00.320
with Children. Why not? The link's down below. Anyway, back to this.

14:00.320 --> 14:04.000
I wish I had a clever transition for this, but I don't. Here's another stupid thing

14:04.000 --> 14:08.960
in the Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness. It's the worst drawing I've ever seen of Elon Musk.

14:08.960 --> 14:13.600
All artists deserve to get paid, and whoever drew this deserves to be paid with

14:13.600 --> 14:17.280
a free copy of this book. That would be a fitting, ironic punishment.

14:17.280 --> 14:20.720
Another way this book really hurts itself is when it more or less gives away how it

14:20.720 --> 14:24.880
writes a bunch of its jokes with its Oppression Identifier Generator.

14:24.880 --> 14:28.320
Let's play it quickly and see what we get. We'll use the name of a stupid dead person

14:28.320 --> 14:38.560
so not to offend anyone. Rush Hudson Limpaugh. He would be a crazy-eyed pansexual Calvinist

14:40.240 --> 14:46.880
with bear lungs. Yeah. Post your own Babylon Bee joke name in the comments. The first person to

14:46.880 --> 14:51.360
laugh has to unsubscribe from my channel. The book then offers a few examples of this game

14:51.360 --> 14:55.120
being played out with some helpful drawings, and this is really how a lot of Babylon Bee

14:55.120 --> 14:59.920
humor works. Just string together random words like it's mad libs, and vaguely gesture at how

14:59.920 --> 15:04.320
the left cares about too many different kinds of victimhood. This tactic combines itself with

15:04.320 --> 15:10.400
another internet content favorite, and that's lists. Lots and lots of lists. A list of oppressed

15:10.400 --> 15:14.640
religions, a list of good and bad countries, a list of things that are racist, a list of things

15:14.640 --> 15:19.120
leftists do and don't think are important, a list of language not to use, a list of black people

15:19.120 --> 15:23.840
the left hates, a list of ways to stop being white, and a list for spotting hidden racism.

15:23.840 --> 15:29.360
And those are just the lists before Chapter 3. These lists are a convenient way to not actually

15:29.360 --> 15:33.600
write jokes, while a small number, such as the list for spotting hidden racism, actually make

15:33.600 --> 15:38.560
an effort. The rest are just some words that are meant to be instantly hilarious. Here's an example

15:38.560 --> 15:44.000
under a list of racist things. They include drinking milk. Because it's white. That's the

15:44.080 --> 15:49.600
whole joke there. It could have been anything white really. Building a snowman, using shaving foam,

15:49.600 --> 15:53.920
blowing your nose with a tissue, drawing on a blank piece of paper, or painting a room white.

15:53.920 --> 15:57.440
I'm halfway through making another list, and all I had to do was spend one minute looking around

15:57.440 --> 16:02.480
my apartment and glancing out the window. This is a very lazy book. Another thing I noticed in this

16:02.480 --> 16:06.560
book is it doesn't seem to understand how Venn diagrams work. Here's an example I found that

16:06.560 --> 16:10.960
shows how each circle represents a quality an animal can have. An example of those animals when

16:10.960 --> 16:16.400
those circles intersect. This is just how Venn diagrams work. Here's one from the Babylon

16:16.400 --> 16:20.960
Bee Guide to Wokeness. It supposedly describes how intersectionalism works, and I gather the joke

16:20.960 --> 16:25.040
here is that it's not supposed to make sense, and that the left-wing people who believe this are too

16:25.040 --> 16:30.080
dumb to put it together. That's why the intersection of nationality and the power of flight is...

16:30.080 --> 16:36.480
werewolf. It's not really a joke, because none of those things are really connected, and overlapping

16:36.480 --> 16:41.600
nationality and the power of flight producing werewolf is just a weird on sequitur. It's mad

16:41.600 --> 16:46.080
libs all over again. Throw random words together, point at the bad group, and say this is what they

16:46.080 --> 16:50.560
really believe. And if the person making this joke doesn't understand how to use these visual graphics,

16:50.560 --> 16:55.360
they can instead flip that around and say it's also satire. You might say that this whole book

16:55.360 --> 17:00.160
is some kind of deeply clever psych out that I'm not getting. That the seemingly lazy and thoughtless

17:00.160 --> 17:04.320
jokes are all a parody of the left, and since they're being sarcastic, any criticism directed

17:04.320 --> 17:10.080
towards them is deflected onto the group they're parroting instead. Except the lazy hypothesis

17:10.080 --> 17:15.680
extends beyond this book. Before the Babylon Bee slid firmly into right-wing culture war stuff,

17:15.680 --> 17:20.480
it was primarily a comedy website making fun of the excesses of religious communities. For example,

17:20.480 --> 17:24.960
they would run articles with headlines such as, there's a 15, maybe 20% chance I'll remember to

17:24.960 --> 17:28.960
pray for you, brother. It does still touch on religion today, though it doesn't quite get the

17:28.960 --> 17:32.960
same love and attention that the culture war stuff does. In the Babylon Bee's Guide to Wokeness,

17:32.960 --> 17:37.120
I paid special attention to its chapter on religion. The whole section feels like a bit

17:37.120 --> 17:41.600
of a reach, as the left isn't really known for its religious zeal, but it does have a go at

17:41.600 --> 17:46.000
claiming the left is trying to reframe Jesus as woke, and is trying to turn churches into

17:46.000 --> 17:50.800
left-wing project centers. It also takes lazy, partisan political swipes. Here's one example

17:50.800 --> 17:56.160
in the section explaining how woke Jesus is. When Lazarus died, Jesus raised him from the dead so he

17:56.160 --> 18:00.960
could vote Democrat. Jesus performed this miracle a few times, raising hordes of people from the

18:00.960 --> 18:04.640
dead and leading them straight over to the voting booth so they could cast their vote for a

18:04.640 --> 18:09.200
Democratic candidate. Democrats are following in his footsteps, and are still performing this

18:09.200 --> 18:14.480
miracle today. This is another example of what this book constantly does, mushing together basic

18:14.480 --> 18:19.440
liberal actions with radical movements. Voting for the Democrats in an election is preferable

18:19.440 --> 18:23.920
to the alternative, but it's hardly the type of radical left-wing politics this book is claiming

18:23.920 --> 18:28.480
to lampoon. The important part here is that this section reflects the book's obvious partisan

18:28.480 --> 18:32.640
leanings. It's about attacking the left on all front, from radical politics to electoralism.

18:32.640 --> 18:37.360
It's a flattening of perspectives to make lazy jokes. The main point here is that this book is

18:37.360 --> 18:42.720
trying to portray the left as co-opting Christianity to advance its political agenda. That was most

18:42.720 --> 18:47.200
apparent at the end of this chapter when it references The Screwtape Letters, a novel written

18:47.200 --> 18:51.600
by C.S. Lewis that's presented as a collection of letters from a senior demon named Screwtape

18:51.600 --> 18:56.800
sent to his nephew Wormwood. The Babylon B book highlights this specific excerpt from the novel.

18:56.800 --> 19:02.560
We do want, and want very much, to make men treat Christianity as a means, preferably of course as

19:02.560 --> 19:08.240
a means to their own advancement, but, failing that, as a means to anything, even to social justice.

19:08.240 --> 19:13.760
The thing to do is to get a man at first to value social justice as a thing which the enemy demands,

19:13.760 --> 19:18.480
and then work him on to the stage at which he values Christianity because it may produce social

19:18.480 --> 19:23.120
justice, for the enemy will not be used as a convenience. It's making the same point as the

19:23.120 --> 19:26.640
chapter that the left is co-opting the church to further its political project, which is

19:26.640 --> 19:31.200
inappropriate since a church should not be used as a tool for one's politics. You might be wondering

19:31.200 --> 19:35.600
how the Democratic Party is particularly guilty of this when you're far more likely to see those in

19:35.600 --> 19:40.800
the Republican Party invoke God and Christian piety. I found this exact C.S. Lewis quote in

19:40.800 --> 19:45.120
another book, though, written in a similar sarcastic tone, only it took a slightly different

19:45.120 --> 19:49.280
approach. Here's an excerpt that followed the reading of this Screwtape passage.

19:49.280 --> 19:53.840
Christianity should only be valued insofar as it helps us win political battles and shape the

19:53.840 --> 19:58.720
social landscape. What's the point of having the power of God in the Gospel and the indwelling Holy

19:58.720 --> 20:02.640
Spirit if we don't use it to our advantage, such as winning the White House, the Supreme Court,

20:02.640 --> 20:06.880
and the Congress for our political party and advancing our own hot-button social issues?

20:06.880 --> 20:11.200
It's the best of both worlds. We get to hang out with our homeboy Jesus, but we still get the

20:11.200 --> 20:15.920
recognition and accolades of the world. So what are you waiting for? Get on over to the nearest GOP

20:15.920 --> 20:20.560
campaign office and start getting involved. While the Guide to Wokeness uses the C.S. Lewis

20:20.560 --> 20:25.040
quote to mock the left for being the one to mix politics and religion, this particular book flips

20:25.040 --> 20:29.440
the equation to call out the right for doing the same thing. And this mystery book I'm talking

20:29.440 --> 20:34.720
about happens to be How to Be a Perfect Christian, your comprehensive guide to flawless spiritual

20:34.720 --> 20:40.320
living written by, would you look at that, the Babylon Bee. How to Be a Perfect Christian was

20:40.320 --> 20:45.520
written all the way back in 2019, and I guess a lot can change in two years because reading this

20:45.520 --> 20:50.320
first book you find excerpts like these. The Democratic Party was founded in 1883 as the

20:50.320 --> 20:54.320
dying wish of Karl Marx because he wanted to infiltrate the once God-fearing nation with his

20:54.320 --> 20:59.600
evil communist ideas. Did I mention this book was written with the same sort of sarcastic tone that

20:59.600 --> 21:04.320
the Guide to Wokeness was? How to Be a Perfect Christian also hits us with one of their signature

21:04.320 --> 21:11.520
lazy lists. Helpful terms for arguing with Democrats online. Libtard. Snowflake. I'm not

21:11.520 --> 21:17.920
a racist, but... Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Food stamp junkie. Godless commie.

21:17.920 --> 21:22.400
One of these really sticks out, and that's I'm not a racist, but, and let's contrast this with

21:22.400 --> 21:27.760
a little excerpt from the Guide to Wokeness. This comes from its list of secret signs of racism.

21:27.760 --> 21:32.960
Three, you say I'm not a racist. This is an obvious one. If you say I'm not a racist,

21:32.960 --> 21:37.200
or I don't hate people for their skin color, you are definitely a racist. Because guess what?

21:37.200 --> 21:42.240
That's exactly what a racist would say. The irony here of course is that the first book mocks how

21:42.240 --> 21:47.440
the right often portrays the left as a caricature, and then the second book just embraces the

21:47.440 --> 21:52.720
caricature, acting like the very people the first book was mocking. Here's another fun excerpt from

21:52.720 --> 21:57.920
How to Be a Perfect Christian. But we do have a word of warning for you, brave Christian Republican

21:57.920 --> 22:02.560
soldier. The most important thing you can remember as you bravely head off to the front lines to fight

22:02.560 --> 22:07.760
for Jesus in the culture wars is this. You are always being persecuted. The Guide to Wokeness,

22:07.760 --> 22:12.800
of course, makes a number of references to Christians being persecuted, such as this excerpt.

22:12.800 --> 22:16.880
But whatever religion you pick, make sure it's an oppressed, exotic, unique belief system that you

22:16.880 --> 22:21.360
can score you woke points, and not something basic and lame like Christianity. If you must be a

22:21.360 --> 22:25.200
Christian though, because your lame parents make you go to church as long as you live under their

22:25.200 --> 22:30.160
floor or whatever, co-opt Christianity for social justice. The only good church is a woke church.

22:30.720 --> 22:35.520
You can see the style here hasn't really evolved. It's all done with the same sort of sarcastic

22:35.520 --> 22:40.160
roleplay of the group they're trying to mock. Where the Babylon B stands becomes a bit tougher

22:40.160 --> 22:45.200
to figure out when you compare these two books. The jokes still aren't terribly funny, but this

22:45.200 --> 22:49.280
book does actually go pretty hard against Republicans for about a chapter, complaining

22:49.280 --> 22:53.200
about how they co-opt religion to advance their political goals. It even mocks conservative

22:53.200 --> 22:57.600
icons such as Ronald Reagan, Rush Limbaugh, and Bill O'Reilly. How to Be a Perfect Christian

22:57.600 --> 23:02.960
is about how Christianity is used by disingenuous people in order to feel smugly superior. And the

23:02.960 --> 23:07.200
Guide to Wokeness, the chapter on religion is making the same point, only now it's claiming

23:07.200 --> 23:11.920
the left is doing this, and not the right. You might assume this is the Babylon B claiming to

23:11.920 --> 23:16.800
not really be a partisan political operation, not choosing one side over the other. Only that

23:16.800 --> 23:22.000
isn't true. The Guide to Wokeness is absolutely advancing a partisan political project. Whereas

23:22.000 --> 23:27.120
the How to Be a Perfect Christian has one chapter about partisan politics, instead mostly focusing

23:27.120 --> 23:32.080
on criticizing superficial acts of faith, the Guide to Wokeness is explicitly an anti-left book,

23:32.080 --> 23:36.960
with nods of appreciation to the right. It is clearly chosen a side here. You might be wondering

23:36.960 --> 23:41.360
how this happened. And it may not be as simple as the Babylon B writers being a bunch of lazy,

23:41.360 --> 23:45.360
soulless grifters who recycle jokes to make easy money from a gullible audience.

23:45.360 --> 23:50.000
How to Be a Perfect Christian was written by Adam Ford and Kyle Mann. In late 2018,

23:50.000 --> 23:54.560
Ford, who had founded the website, sold it to Seth Dillon and moved on to other projects. So

23:54.560 --> 23:58.240
while Ford still has a financial stake in the outlet he created, he doesn't have any role in

23:58.240 --> 24:02.720
producing its content. So it's quite possible that Ford's voice, which may have included critiques of

24:02.720 --> 24:07.760
hypocritical Christians on the political right, is just no longer part of the Babylon B's output.

24:07.760 --> 24:11.920
Though that doesn't stop them from bringing up the same points he does, right down to the same

24:11.920 --> 24:16.640
C.S. Lewis quote, and lazily flipping those jokes to be about the other side of the political aisle.

24:16.640 --> 24:21.600
Or it's possible that the same set of jokes came from How to Be a Perfect Christian's other author,

24:21.600 --> 24:26.240
Kyle Mann, who still works at the Babylon B and also is one of the co-authors of The Guide to

24:26.240 --> 24:30.320
Wokeness. And he'll make the same lame jokes about anyone so long as he's getting paid.

24:30.320 --> 24:34.640
Speaking to The Atlantic, Mann described the joy he gets from his humor like this.

24:51.600 --> 25:18.080
His point doesn't really make sense here because saying something isn't funny isn't really the same

25:18.080 --> 25:23.600
as being upset. If anything, it's absence of a reaction, not laughing, and then informing the

25:23.600 --> 25:28.560
person telling the joke that it sucks. But I want to focus on the point about how the Babylon B is

25:28.560 --> 25:33.840
making some kind of meta-commentary, ironically mocking boomer jokes, a special in-joke that

25:33.840 --> 25:38.640
only they're getting. But if they are mocking boomer jokes, it's not even consistent with an

25:38.640 --> 25:41.680
earlier comment from that same interview where this exchange happened.

25:48.080 --> 26:11.440
The Babylon B is an unapologetic outlet for boomer humor. Except when you point out how

26:11.440 --> 26:16.400
bad their jokes are, then they're actually mocking boomer humor. Regardless of how they defend their

26:16.400 --> 26:21.120
weak humor though, The Babylon B's Guide to Wokeness is a deeply lazy book. Recycling jokes

26:21.120 --> 26:25.120
throughout its run, some borrowed from memes that are nearly five years old, doing the bare minimum

26:25.120 --> 26:30.240
to vaguely gestured humor with effortless lists, and in some cases reusing jokes from books they

26:30.240 --> 26:34.560
published a few years ago. Going back to the Heartland Institute, The Guide to Wokeness' co-author

26:34.560 --> 26:39.360
Joel Berry said, the book only took a few months to write, which sounds, if anything, slightly

26:39.360 --> 26:43.040
longer than I would have guessed. Here's one particular part of the interview I enjoyed.

26:47.120 --> 26:54.000
We do these kind of funny corporate art style stick figure infographics where we're

26:54.000 --> 27:02.240
explaining how to do something silly. We wanted a kind of a light, silly critique that is substantive.

27:03.040 --> 27:10.160
We did our research and we wanted to make it accurate and insightful if you want to read it

27:10.160 --> 27:14.640
cover to cover. But it's also just something you can pick up and there's going to be a joke,

27:14.640 --> 27:18.640
no matter what page you turn to, a funny picture. And it's just silly, you know,

27:18.640 --> 27:22.560
we felt like people needed to laugh at this whole movement. And let's go back to how to be a perfect

27:22.560 --> 27:28.240
Christian one last time. The best way to engage in conversation with those of opposing worldviews is

27:28.240 --> 27:33.040
to misrepresent their positions using a hilarious meme or graphic and then plaster it all over the

27:33.040 --> 27:40.160
internet. I hope the irony isn't lost on anyone. A few of my patrons had questions about this video

27:40.160 --> 27:45.040
and I want to answer them here. A few people asked me if there was any part of this or any part of

27:45.040 --> 27:51.360
the Babylombie's output that I found genuinely humorous. That's a very good and challenging

27:51.360 --> 27:56.960
question to answer. I think the closest I got to laughing is in its list of handy tips for being

27:56.960 --> 28:03.440
less white. They aren't great jokes, but they reveal a level of self-awareness that shows

28:03.440 --> 28:09.120
an actual familiarity about stereotypes around white people. Smash your Taylor Swift albums or

28:09.120 --> 28:13.520
buy hot sauce or donate your new balances to goodwill. With a little effort, these could have

28:13.520 --> 28:18.960
been good jokes. They're sort of mediocre otherwise. They are the closest I got to laughing

28:18.960 --> 28:25.120
though, so that was something. Another person asked if a real human being has ever genuinely

28:25.120 --> 28:31.760
laughed at a joke delivered by Greg Gutfeld. Probably not. Probably not. Another question asked

28:31.760 --> 28:37.040
was, is there a way for conservative humor to be good? And I think, yeah, probably. The problem is

28:37.040 --> 28:42.400
conservative audiences should be more demanding, I hope, and I think it takes a real effort to make

28:42.400 --> 28:46.880
people who disagree with you politically laugh, and that effort simply isn't there amongst

28:46.880 --> 28:53.040
conservative comedians who can just play to these very easy, basic narratives and not really work on

28:53.040 --> 28:57.760
creating meaningful or good jokes. Like the aforementioned list of things people can do to

28:57.760 --> 29:02.320
stop being white, there were some ideas there that could have been fashioned into real joke if even

29:02.320 --> 29:07.440
some kind of effort was put into it. And I do think left-wingers can fall into the same exact

29:07.440 --> 29:12.560
trap of creating cheap jokes but still getting a laugh out of them because they're targeted at

29:12.560 --> 29:17.040
the right person. If you would like to ask some questions to possibly get them answered at the end

29:17.040 --> 29:20.400
of a video, maybe you should become a patron too. At the very least, you'd get your name in the

29:20.400 --> 29:24.480
