1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,600
In 1993, Boy Meets World debuted, telling the story of Corey Matthews as he navigated

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,200
the troubled waters of childhood into adulthood.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,400
Though never a breakout hit, it was a fixture Friday nights, running for seven seasons following

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,960
Corey and his friends from middle school to college.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,560
After the show ended, it surprisingly got even more popular through syndication, with

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,360
its blend of a classic coming-of-age story and nostalgia for a time when the world seemed

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:22,800
like a much kinder place.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,360
To tell the story of Boy Meets World though, we need to start with the story of TGIF, the

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,640
programming block on ABC where Boy Meets World debuted.

10
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,000
ABC had long been a home for comedy on Friday nights, from The Adventures of Ozzy and Harriet

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
to The Brady Bunch.

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,400
In the late 1980s, ABC stood in contrast to rival networks NBC and CBS, which had more

13
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,880
dramatic programming on the evening, so they came up with a promotional hook that would

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:48,720
distinguish them from their rival networks, emphasizing the family-friendly nature of

15
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,880
their comedy lineup.

16
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:53,120
Bob Iger, president of ABC Entertainment at the time, explained,

17
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,760
A lot of families weren't watching TV together as much as when I was growing up, but I thought,

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,080
if we could program shows where parents and kids could watch together, we'd be better

19
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,960
off from a ratings perspective.

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,080
It would be named TGIF, which stood for Thank Goodness It's Funny, and more than just a

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,400
name, what would connect these shows would be a series of promotional spots where the

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:15,560
cast from each respective program would serve as hosts for the night, as if they were sitting

23
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,880
alongside the audience in their home watching the shows with them.

24
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,720
TGIF debuted in 1989, and its first lineup of shows included Full House, Family Matters,

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,040
Perfect Strangers, and Just the Ten of Us.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,400
TGIF was a massive hit, particularly with younger audiences, and part of what made it

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,600
so successful is that once a family sat down to watch TGIF, they usually stuck around for

28
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
the whole night.

29
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,680
TGIF's lineup would change over the years.

30
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,640
Its earlier years would include shows such as Step by Step and Dinosaurs, and its later

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,520
years with Cianad, Hangin' with Mr. Cooper, Sister Sister, and Sabrina the Teenage Witch.

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,960
All of these shows had a distinct family-friendly feel, they also featured a number of fun crossovers.

33
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,200
Family Matters, for instance, was already a spin-off of Perfect Strangers, so it was

34
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,480
no surprise to see those characters crossover.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:02,360
But we would also see Steve Urkel show up on Full House and Step by Step, and Michelle

36
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,440
from Full House would pop up on Hangin' with Mr. Cooper.

37
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,480
While all of these shows deserve their place in discussions about TGIF, there is one show

38
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,200
that embodied the spirit of TGIF, and that show is Boy Meets World.

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,360
Although Boy Meets World was not the breakout hit of this night, it was the only long-running

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:23,360
show that debuted and ended as part of the TGIF Friday night lineup.

41
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,560
Boy Meets World was destined to be a TGIF show before it was even an idea.

42
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,000
Series creator Michael Jacobs had been working on Dinosaurs for ABC's TGIF before it was

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,160
moved to Wednesday Nights, a move, by the way, Jacobs considers the reason that particular

44
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
series only ran for four seasons.

45
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,440
Dinosaurs' big numbers with families on Friday nights motivated Disney to task Jacobs

46
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,760
with developing a show for the 12-14-year-old demographic.

47
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,680
He thought of other family shows such as Family Ties and Growing Pains, which focused on the

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,240
oldest childhood of family.

49
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,040
Jacobs had another idea, though.

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,240
In an interview, he said,

51
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,080
What if we did a different structure?

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,680
What if we took a middle child and instead of focusing on the first date aspect of the

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,520
older child, he was looking at it as a betrayal?

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,080
Jacobs contacted ABC to find out who they had under contract, and the one kid they had available

55
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:11,800
was Ben Savage, who at the time was only thought of as the younger brother of Fred Savage,

56
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,480
the current star of the TV series The Wonder Years.

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,040
Jacobs and Savage immediately hit it off, and the series quickly took shape.

58
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:20,240
Jacobs describes the series at its beginning.

59
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:24,440
What if there's a kid who is an everyman who loses his touchstone, his older brother,

60
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:26,520
and he's lost and confused in the world?

61
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,600
With the premise established, Jacobs teamed with veteran writer April Kelly to pen the

62
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,480
first episode of the series, and it was soon time to cast the show.

63
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,320
Naturally, Ben Savage would play the lead, Corey Matthews, the middle child of the Matthews

64
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,320
family.

65
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,960
Corey starts the show in sixth grade.

66
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:45,160
He's an energetic kid who is less than committed to his schoolwork, and happily sits as the

67
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:49,560
every kid everyone watching was supposed to identify with as he started taking his first

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,480
steps into the big world around him.

69
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,520
Apparently, he'd rather listen to the baseball game on the radio than try to understand the

70
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,160
emotional content of Romeo and Juliet.

71
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,160
Mom, I'm a kid!

72
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,320
I don't understand the emotional content of Full House!

73
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,580
William Daniels played George Feeney, or more commonly, Mr. Feeney, and he was based

74
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,440
on a drama teacher Michael Jacobs had had in high school.

75
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:14,000
Although Daniels expressed reluctance when he was offered the role, he accepted once

76
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,120
he learned that, in spite of his name, the character of Mr. Feeney would not be mocking

77
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:22,160
teachers but rather demonstrating the profound impact they have on young minds.

78
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,040
Not only Corey's teacher, Mr. Feeney lived next door to the Matthews home, meaning that,

79
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,320
no matter where Corey went, he could never escape his watchful eye or sage advice.

80
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,920
You know, you're not doing your body any favors loading up on junk like that.

81
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,440
Oh, thanks Mr. Feeney, and please enjoy that high-vitamin astronaut drink you're sucking down.

82
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,680
There's no gravity in space, Mr. Matthews, therefore astronauts suck up.

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,680
Learn from them.

84
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,520
Corey's older brother, Eric, was played by Will Friedel.

85
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,600
Although Friedel wasn't the first choice for the role, after the pilot was shot, the

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,720
role was recast and given to Friedel instead.

87
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,880
Friedel was given the role because he was taller than the first actor, and they didn't

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,400
want Corey growing up to be taller than his older brother.

89
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,920
Eric begins the series as the date-obsessed older brother, that over the years he would

90
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,400
become one of the goofier members of the cast.

91
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,720
Like I don't have anything else in my mind but girls.

92
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,960
Look, I got a lot of other things in my mind besides girls.

93
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:13,960
A lot of other things.

94
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,120
There's like, girl, girl, right there, right there!

95
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Ryder Strong was cast to play Corey's best friend, Sean Hunter.

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,200
According to Michael Jacobs, Strong was the first and only boy he considered for the role.

97
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,920
Sean is the rebellious best friend with a troubled home life, in stark contrast to the

98
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,680
more wholesome Matthews household.

99
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,040
Stacey says you should have watched it up 45 minutes ago.

100
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,040
Ahhh!

101
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,720
Stacey says you shouldn't have left it in so long.

102
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,480
Stacey says why didn't you two idiots read the label?

103
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,120
Oh, thanks Stacey.

104
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,240
Lee Norris played class nerd Minkus, a foil and sometimes friend for Corey and Sean.

105
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,160
Minkus would only be around in the first season, though he would have a memorable cameo later

106
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,160
in the series.

107
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,200
You are gonna live in the lap of luxury because I am a provider, babe.

108
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,040
Lily Nixay played Morgan, Corey's younger sister.

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,440
The Morgan type character was a staple of the family sitcom, being the adorable little

110
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,080
kid who would come in to deliver a few cute one-liners.

111
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,240
Hey, go to the game with my sister and her doll!

112
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,240
Great!

113
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,880
Maybe during the seventh inning stretch, I could run through the stadium in my old Spider-Man

114
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
underwear.

115
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,280
Well, you don't have to dress up for me.

116
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,480
Betsy Randall played Amy, Corey's mother.

117
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,320
Randall at the time had appeared on a handful of other sitcoms, most notably with a recurring

118
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,600
role in Home Improvement.

119
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,160
Amy would provide guidance to all of her kids throughout the series' run.

120
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,480
Let's see, when you have your 20th high school reunion, I'll be...

121
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,480
44th.

122
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,600
Mom, how can that be possible?

123
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,600
You're already...

124
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
It's possible.

125
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,120
It's not only possible, it's the way it's going to be.

126
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,720
William Russ played Corey's father, Alan.

127
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,360
Much like the role of Eric, Alan was also recast after a test pilot.

128
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,920
And much like Amy, Alan would provide words of wisdom to his children, often being highlighted

129
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,560
as the male role model for young Corey.

130
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Remember before the children?

131
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,120
Before we were married?

132
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,760
Before we knew each other?

133
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,760
Remember how happy we were?

134
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:08,840
Although she wasn't a part of the original principal cast, it would be impossible not

135
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,240
to mention the season 1 recurring character, Topanga Lawrence, played by Daniel Fischl.

136
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:16,760
Taking her name from a canyon in California that Michael Jacobs happened upon while on

137
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,460
a drive, Topanga is a free spirit who is in stark contrast to Corey and Sean.

138
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,080
She would be the love interest for Corey when she joined the principal cast in season 2.

139
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,120
Topanga's triple teamed at the timeline.

140
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,400
She breaks the trap, heads to the top of the key and leaps toward the basket, doing a spiraling

141
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Tomahawk 360!

142
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Slam dunk!

143
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:43,760
A number of other characters would be introduced throughout the show's run.

144
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:50,880
But for season 1, these were the characters Corey would be meeting the world alongside.

145
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,000
On September 24th, 1993, Boy Meets World debuted with its pilot episode, creatively titled

146
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,160
Pilot.

147
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,720
This episode's plot used the very example Michael Jacobs referenced when talking about

148
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,600
his idea for the series, with Corey feeling betrayed when Eric takes a date to a baseball

149
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:13,320
game instead of his younger brother.

150
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,360
Corey's feeling of betrayal manifests into a skepticism towards love in general.

151
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,080
And in a fitting lesson, his class happens to be learning about Romeo and Juliet.

152
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:25,200
When he accidentally sees Mr. Feeny was stood up for a date, Corey throws that in his teacher's

153
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:35,520
face as part of his stand against love.

154
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:54,080
Feeny gives us the first of many speeches where he tries to impart some wisdom to Corey.

155
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,720
When Eric reveals his date was a failure, Corey applies the lesson he learned from Mr.

156
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:13,200
Feeny and encourages his older brother not to give up on love.

157
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,120
Corey's understanding of the world around him is expanding, and the first lesson in

158
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,080
the pilot is about the power of love.

159
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,560
In other shows, this would be shown by Corey going on a date, but in this case, it's Corey

160
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,120
seeing his brother go on a date and getting a glimpse of Mr. Feeny having a romantic tryst,

161
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,960
even if the salad dinner was actually going to be with his sister.

162
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,560
Rather than experience the world directly, Corey is in the enviable position of getting

163
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,960
a lesson about the world before diving into it.

164
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,920
This is part of the reason Mr. Feeny has such a big role in the series.

165
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,920
Mr. Feeny is teaching these kids lessons about how the world works before they step into

166
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,520
it themselves, much like the kids who would be watching the series at home would be learning

167
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,980
lessons from seeing Corey learn them on TV.

168
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,820
The pilot episode has a heavy emphasis on Corey's home life, but as the series progressed,

169
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,220
the focus would switch more to school and his friends.

170
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:58,620
The series was still a few episodes from stepping on that path, but we could see how the theme

171
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,780
of learning about the world was still a core of its identity.

172
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:05,460
The original script for the pilot didn't impress William Daniels.

173
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,460
Speaking in an interview with People.com, Daniels explained,

174
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:11,120
"...Michael and I are very close.

175
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,700
He likes to tell the story that we had one read-through of the rehearsal and I went to

176
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,460
his office and I quit, and he said, Bill, that was just a read-through.

177
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:23,180
I said, yeah, but he said, listen to me, I'm going to rework this tonight and you tell

178
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,180
me tomorrow.

179
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:27,260
If you want to quit, okay, but wait until I revise it.

180
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:30,660
So the next day, the whole thing, it was different.

181
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,300
He rewrote the damn thing.

182
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,340
So I stayed."

183
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,380
That adaptability, along with a solid premise, gave Boy Meets World a flexibility that allowed

184
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,660
it to change over the years to adapt its theme to new dynamics.

185
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,100
And a few of those new dynamics were introduced very quickly in season one with the key episode,

186
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,600
Corey's Alternative Friends.

187
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,880
In this episode, we're introduced to Topanga.

188
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,880
"- Give me your hand.

189
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,960
Why?

190
00:10:52,960 --> 00:11:01,240
I want to see if our energies converge.

191
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,920
He's vibrationally acceptable."

192
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:07,240
Whereas Sean is Corey's partner in crime as the average back row slacker, Topanga is

193
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,000
completely unlike Corey.

194
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,920
She's willing to stand out when Corey would rather blend in.

195
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,360
"- People make fun of you, Topanga.

196
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,600
No, I couldn't take it.

197
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,800
I just want to blend in.

198
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Well, you're sure good at it.

199
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,360
You look like all the other plain-wrapped kids at school, except for your red hat.

200
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
Hey, I got that on cat night.

201
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
I had to wait an hour in line.

202
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:40,400
Well, if it's important to you, then it's beautiful."

203
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,280
After a hair styling accident, all part of an attempt by Corey to blend in with the other

204
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,480
kids, he learns the importance of being true to one's inner self.

205
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:50,960
And he also learns the value of his social conscience when he helps Topanga and her friends

206
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,720
create a blockade to keep the school librarian from being replaced.

207
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,640
Corey also finds out that there might be more to him in Topanga than a passing friendship.

208
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,480
"- Sometimes, the reluctant warrior is the bravest warrior.

209
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:11,200
You're not gonna, like, kiss me now, are you?

210
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
Would it be your first kiss?

211
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Hey, don't come near me.

212
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:21,840
Because it would be interesting if all your life you remembered that your first kiss happened

213
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,520
when you thought you looked weird.

214
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:27,800
I would have to feel I really knew the person and that I liked him.

215
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Good.

216
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
Good."

217
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:43,920
Although it would be some time before we saw how this romance would play out, it was

218
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,440
here we first got a glimpse of this key relationship, the Corey and Topanga romance.

219
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,040
And while the kiss at the end is probably most remembered by audiences, the small moment

220
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,840
they share at the end of the episode was also sweet.

221
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,120
What makes this relationship interesting is how the power dynamics are inverted.

222
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,920
It might be because of their age or Topanga just generally having a strong will, but it

223
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,000
is at odds with the more traditional stories where the boy makes the first move.

224
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,640
And the broader lesson for Corey here is how someone can enter his life and turn it completely

225
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,760
upside down.

226
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,520
The show may be titled Boy Meets World, but sometimes it's the world that's meeting

227
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
the boy.

228
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:19,160
And while Corey can't control someone such as Topanga, he can control his reaction to

229
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,560
her and use this chance to learn more about himself in the process.

230
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,840
The Topanga character wasn't intended to be a major part of the series, but would be

231
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:29,520
written into a number of episodes for the first season, one of the producers, Jeff

232
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
Manal explains.

233
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,520
When their hands touch, there's a spark.

234
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,600
They had chemistry, the two kids, the actors, so we just kept writing storylines and I think

235
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,400
it progressed as a natural thing.

236
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,480
The episode shifted Boy Meets World more towards school life for Corey and his friends, which

237
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,840
is only natural is that this is the setting where change happens in a young person's

238
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,500
life, a safe staging area for the big changes of the real world.

239
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,360
Another key change in this episode was the role of Sean.

240
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,560
In the first few episodes of this series, we see Corey and Sean with a rotating third

241
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,560
friend.

242
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,320
None of these third kids ever quite worked out, and though a third friend was written

243
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,000
for Corey's alternative friends, the actor who was supposed to play him was fired and

244
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,880
all of his lines were given to Sean.

245
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,660
This created space for what would be another of the show's most important relationships,

246
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,260
the Corey and Sean friendship.

247
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,680
There were still a few rough edges this early in the series.

248
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,000
Sean, for instance, makes reference to a sister we will never hear about again, apparently

249
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,840
an artifact from the lines of the third kid in the episode's original script.

250
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:24,680
We also get a sense of Sean having a similar middle-class life to Corey, only he's a

251
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,600
bit taller with better hair.

252
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:30,240
Over time we would learn a lot more about Sean and his unique circumstances, but this

253
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,400
episode was about establishing the close friendship that these two have.

254
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:37,920
There were a few key episodes in season one that would establish who Sean was as a character.

255
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,360
In Santa's Little Helper, we find out that Sean's father has lost his job.

256
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:53,520
In addition to the financial strain Sean faces at home, we also find out that Sean has his

257
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:58,000
tendency to be a bit more rebellious than Corey in the episode titled The Fugitive, where

258
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,480
he blows up a mailbox.

259
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:24,480
Both of these episodes would establish important parts of the Corey and Sean friendship.

260
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,520
They raise questions for Corey on how to best stand by his friend when he needs support

261
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,880
because of his difficult life, and how best to steer him on the right path when something

262
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
goes wrong.

263
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:47,880
The importance of this friendship reveals that lesson about how to navigate the world

264
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:52,280
aren't just imparted to kids from wise adults, such as Mr. Feeney, but also learned from

265
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,480
other kids, such as Corey being a positive influence to Sean, and in some ways, Sean

266
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,760
serving as a lesson on what type of behavior to avoid.

267
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,040
As the series is focusing on that journey to adulthood, it's important to ask how

268
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,440
it plots that route out for its characters, and with something as important as raising

269
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,680
the next generation of adults, in its first season, Boy Meets World plays it safe, and

270
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,720
it takes certain assumptions for granted.

271
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,760
The Matthews family lives in a suburban Philadelphia neighborhood.

272
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,960
The kids have their basics met, their school is well-equipped, and they embody typical

273
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,160
American TV sitcom values.

274
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,600
Their major influences in life are their friends, family, and teachers.

275
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:30,720
And those influences are all within a greater context of an idealized world for those kids

276
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:34,840
to grow in without facing any traumatic hardships, at least in the first season.

277
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:54,720
In the episode Model Family, it opens with a clip from the 1950s sitcom Leave it to Beaver.

278
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:59,120
This episode offers the kids a chance to roleplay the parts of a model family.

279
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,720
The message of the episode is that family lives are complicated and not the tidy package

280
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,720
you see on TV.

281
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,040
Only it doesn't really work as the Matthews family, for all its modern faults, is still

282
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
ideal.

283
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,800
The parents are happily married, there's no sign of financial strain, and they generally

284
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,260
all have happy, positive lives.

285
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,520
This is the comfy white middle-class family that the America of the 90s treated pretty

286
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,280
well, at least compared to other families.

287
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:25,780
Leave it to Beaver and the first season of Boy Meets World are both operated in the same

288
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:30,200
kind of world, one where certain norms keep the Cleavers and the Matthews from facing

289
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:49,400
financial ruin or other traumas.

290
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,680
While the writing may have changed, the premise is still the same, asking the question of

291
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,200
how children become adults in the modern American world.

292
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,040
In its first season, the show does very little to question the modern American world, instead

293
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,520
taking its assumption of a comfortable middle-class suburbia for granted.

294
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,000
As an example, in the episode Risky Business, Cory and Sean are tasked with starting a business

295
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:21,400
and instead bet on a horse race.

296
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,140
Cory and Sean learn the positive impact of risks, though the lesson is turned on its

297
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:35,420
head when Cory risks leaving Morgan at home alone, and she breaks a window.

298
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:53,460
And they learn an important lesson about taking risks.

299
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,620
This episode reinforces the American cliché of being a self-starter, with Cory and Sean's

300
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,060
business strategy literally being a gamble.

301
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:03,420
And the reason it isn't necessarily a bad thing is because it was an amount of money

302
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,820
they could afford to lose.

303
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,880
The irreplaceable Morgan, on the other hand, was a very bad thing to risk.

304
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,340
This raises an interesting question, though.

305
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:14,160
What about people who can't afford to take risks?

306
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,220
This lesson at a larger scale would mean more than gambling on a horse, it would mean gambling

307
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,440
on yourself and risking personal finance chasing business success.

308
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,660
After all, that was the lesson for the kids, how they would turn a small investment into

309
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,980
a thriving business.

310
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:31,060
But anyone without the resources to start a business doesn't really have access to

311
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,100
this kind of risk.

312
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:35,820
Or rather, even if they have those resources, they may not be able to afford to lose them

313
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
at all.

314
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:41,300
It reveals this lesson, which seems universal, to rather be a reflection of the class dynamics

315
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:45,300
that afford some people that have the means to take risks while others don't.

316
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,820
In this way, the first season of Boy Meets World reveals itself to be a deeply conservative

317
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,660
show, taking the status quo of its world for granted to teach lessons that are less universal

318
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:56,060
when stepping outside of the bubble it creates.

319
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,260
This isn't to say the show didn't at least make some attempts at making contemporary

320
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
critiques.

321
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,140
In the episode, Teachers Bet, Mr. Feeny challenges Corey with teaching the rest of the class

322
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,060
ahead of an upcoming test, with the promise of a nude bike if he can get more kids to

323
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,220
pass the test.

324
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:12,820
As the class spirals out of control, Corey tries to regain some of it, and he's forced

325
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:16,180
to learn the material more deeply so he can teach it to his fellow students.

326
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:20,460
And the class's particular lesson for this week is on discrimination.

327
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,380
Corey struggles, as he's under the assumption that discrimination is a thing of the past,

328
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:38,420
until something happens to Eric's girlfriend Linda.

329
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,380
When Corey tries to teach the class about discrimination, he uses an unconventional

330
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,380
method.

331
00:20:43,380 --> 00:21:07,620
He calls Sean an anti-Italian racial slur.

332
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:26,620
The number of kids who passed was the same as last time, so Corey doesn't win the bet,

333
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,380
but that's a pretty good result, considering Corey is just a kid and he apparently teaches

334
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,140
just as well as Mr. Feeny, for one test anyway.

335
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:37,500
Corey's methods are extreme, and the sort that would only work among kids, as a teacher

336
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,140
using a racial slur on a student would take a different tone.

337
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,860
But it does highlight how the show is willing to acknowledge an issue like prejudice, albeit

338
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,340
from the perspective of a group of characters who are largely only talking about it hypothetically

339
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,540
in a classroom setting.

340
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:55,620
It also at least introduces us to Linda putting a face to an actual victim of discrimination,

341
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:58,140
though her guest role wouldn't last more than this episode.

342
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:01,140
And it speaks volumes that the show had to bring in a whole new character to even have

343
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,980
the means of directly approaching the topic of racial discrimination.

344
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,700
In this way, Boy Meets World was able to tackle an important issue, though its work

345
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,900
is really just in uncovering that truth that discrimination still exists in the modern

346
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,060
day, which is, of course, very valuable to know.

347
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:19,020
But it doesn't take it much further than that, it doesn't explore where these ideas

348
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,540
come from, the systems that uphold them, or how to undermine them.

349
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:27,700
Though fair enough, perhaps it's worth stepping back and acknowledging that such a deep dive

350
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,420
in discrimination is a bit too much for an 11 year old.

351
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:34,620
Episodes such as these reveal the series wasn't afraid of varying away from the silly

352
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,060
or comedic associated with sitcoms that focus on kids, and in the future, the series would

353
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,300
more fully embrace weightier subjects.

354
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,940
The first season of Boy Meets World is a bit of an outlier, clearly geared toward a younger

355
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:48,720
audience and the only season before the teen years of Cory and his friends.

356
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,240
That may be why it played it so safe, taking a very conventional approach to depicting

357
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,260
the precarious journey from childhood to adulthood.

358
00:22:55,260 --> 00:23:00,940
Later seasons would be far more daring.

359
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:03,440
Season 2 brought with it a number of major changes.

360
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,940
Most importantly, Cory and his friends would be going to high school, although we wouldn't

361
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,220
be watching all of their high school journeys.

362
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,900
The character Stuart Minkus exited the series after season 1, and he would be replaced by

363
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:14,900
Topanga.

364
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,840
This wasn't based on a competing spot, though.

365
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:21,460
At the same time, on Family Matters, the character of Steve Urkel was massively popular.

366
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,700
Minkus was considered too similar to Urkel, and so he was cut from the show.

367
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,540
Season 2 also brought a number of new faces as well.

368
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:33,500
Cory and Sean were confronted by their first bully, Harley Keiner, played by Danny McNulty,

369
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:39,260
flanked by his henchmen, Joey, played by Blake Soper, and Frankie, played by Ethan Suppley.

370
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:43,820
Anthony Tyler Quinn joined the principal cast as the high school English teacher, Jonathan

371
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:48,220
Turner, a young teacher who adopts a different approach from last year's Mr. Feeney.

372
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:08,620
This doesn't mean Mr. Feeney would be leaving us, though.

373
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,980
Not only was he transferred to the same school Cory and Sean went to, John Adams High School,

374
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:21,300
but he would be pulling double duty as both history teacher and school principal.

375
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,380
The cast weren't the only ones changing, though.

376
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,660
The audience was starting to change alongside them.

377
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,940
Michael Jacobs explained in an interview.

378
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:32,580
At the beginning of the series, Sean, Feeney, and Topango all tested higher than Cory Matthews,

379
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,020
because these were the characters that viewers understood.

380
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,820
You understood Sean immediately.

381
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,020
You understood Topanga as odd and lovely and wonderful.

382
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,580
Feeney was the authority figure.

383
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:46,780
He tested highest, even with kids, but by the second season, Cory eclipsed everybody.

384
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:50,460
What happened was, the kids wanted to be Sean and wanted to be Topanga.

385
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,060
They don't want to say they want to be what they are.

386
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:57,900
Cory became a hero for Beat himself, and everybody flocked to the fact that, wait, I have potential

387
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,740
in just being who I am.

388
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,860
And kids were finally honest enough to answer the question correctly.

389
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,460
Who do I associate with?

390
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:06,860
I am Cory Matthews.

391
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,380
As the audience found its footing, so did the series, and Boy Meets World began to grow

392
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:14,820
into a more sophisticated show, speaking to the real issues and concerns facing kids who

393
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:18,700
no longer saw the series as solely aspirational, but rather something that reflected their

394
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:19,700
own lives.

395
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:24,420
And the character of Sean Hunter would serve as a lesson in how things can go wrong.

396
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,300
Although he blew up a mailbox and faced some financial hardship in season one, it's

397
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,220
seasons two and three that really establish how Sean's life differs from Cory's.

398
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:36,020
Actor Ryder Strong explained his interpretation of Sean in an interview, saying,

399
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:52,820
Obviously, within the confines of a safe family sitcom, so it's not like Sean was shooting

400
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,260
up or killing people.

401
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:57,660
While Sean wasn't about to blow up a mailbox every week on the show, he did continue to

402
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:02,300
engage in some low-level hijinks, like changing the school paper's headline to a solid burn

403
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,380
on Mr. Feeny.

404
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:13,100
The headline is traced to Cory, who decides to cover for Sean, and the episode is about

405
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,780
not writing out your friend when they do something wrong.

406
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,380
And by something wrong, in this case, they mean something totally awesome.

407
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,060
While Cory is the positive influence keeping Sean from screwing up too badly, the limits

408
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,100
of that are tested as the bullies present an alternative in the episode, Wrong Side

409
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
of the Tracks.

410
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:31,060
Look, I just think you're gonna have a problem if you hang out with guys like that.

411
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,140
Yeah, well they happen to be my kind of guys, okay?

412
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,140
We're part of the same circle.

413
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,140
Look, Sean.

414
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,140
Cory.

415
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,540
Let go.

416
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:41,140
We find out that Sean believes his own future has already been decided.

417
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:46,140
Cory, you and I are different, and sooner or later we're gonna end up in different places.

418
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,140
Says who?

419
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,420
Why don't we both just do us a favor right now and call it quits, okay?

420
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:51,820
What has gotten into you?

421
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:53,700
You just don't get it, do you?

422
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
Get what?

423
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Look at your house, Cory.

424
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,700
Look at where you live.

425
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,700
Look at where I live.

426
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,700
Look at your parents.

427
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,700
Look at my parents.

428
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:00,700
I know where I'm gonna end up.

429
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Just let me get there now.

430
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Sean!

431
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:07,820
Just let me get there now!

432
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:11,660
What's interesting about Sean's turn away from Cory is not that Cory is a bad friend,

433
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:15,060
as we just saw Cory willing to take the fall for Sean in an earlier episode.

434
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:18,900
This is about how Sean sees himself, and how he doesn't consider a guy like him good enough

435
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,940
to be friends with a guy like Cory.

436
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:25,100
Ironically, Sean wants to stop hanging around Cory because he cares enough to not want to

437
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,720
drag him down with the path he assumes he's on.

438
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,980
For all of Cory's work to help his friend, it's not quite enough to steer Sean in the

439
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:33,580
right direction, as the influence of the bullies increases.

440
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,500
If you're gonna do this, Sean, then I'm gonna do it.

441
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
This is not your place, okay?

442
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
What are you saying?

443
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
I don't belong here?

444
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

445
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,500
Look, if you belong here, then I belong here.

446
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,460
Hey, baboon, look, we got some business here, alright?

447
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,500
So I suggest that you walk away while your legs still bend only once.

448
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,860
Listen, Kyle, this is between me and Sean.

449
00:27:49,860 --> 00:28:02,820
Luckily for Sean, and Cory's face, Mr. Turner shows up to talk some sense into Sean.

450
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:23,860
Can you drag the trailer park trash up the decent society?

451
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,860
Hey, if you don't know that deep down inside, you're alright.

452
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
And I haven't taught you anything at all.

453
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,860
You think I'm alright?

454
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,860
I think you need to think you're alright.

455
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,860
You think I'm alright?

456
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:45,860
I think, if you put your mind to it and get back inside that school, and never, never

457
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:48,860
go near this Harley, or that Harley.

458
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,860
Yeah, I think you'll be alright.

459
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:56,860
What was so great about this episode is that it reveals Sean's bad behaviour isn't a

460
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,860
product of some inner drive to be a bad kid, but rather a reflection of how Sean sees himself

461
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,860
through the world around him.

462
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,860
All the jokes and comments about being poor and not getting good grades reinforce the

463
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:09,860
idea that Sean's not someone who's going to succeed in life.

464
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:13,860
And as his performance worsens, those messages get louder and louder.

465
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:16,860
And the only way to break the cycle is for people in his life to show him that he's

466
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,860
worth more than what the world is telling him.

467
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:23,860
Implicit in this is a condemnation of a society that lets any kid feel lesser than some social

468
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,860
standard because they may not be excelling at school, or they come from a less privileged

469
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
background.

470
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,860
Although the series doesn't explore these topics directly in this episode, it does become

471
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,860
more explicit as the show progresses.

472
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:37,860
And the pensive expression on Mr. Turner's face at the end of the episode reveals that

473
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,860
this issue hasn't been entirely settled.

474
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:44,860
The two episodes at the end of season 2, Career Day and Home, further emphasize the unfolding

475
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,860
tragedy of Sean's life when his mother runs off with the family's mobile home,

476
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:51,860
and Chet's father chases after her, leaving Sean behind.

477
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:54,860
Chet Hunter is played by Blake Clark.

478
00:29:54,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Sean ends up staying with the Matthews family, and we quickly find out that situation is not ideal.

479
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:30,860
With hospitality wearing thin at the Matthews home, Sean decides to take up Mr. Turner's

480
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,860
offer for a place to stay, and when Sean finds out that his father isn't coming back any

481
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,860
time soon, that offer becomes more permanent.

482
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:02,860
This episode completes the second season's arc for Mr. Turner and Sean, as the two branch

483
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,860
off into some of their own stories for the third season.

484
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:08,860
But what's worth highlighting here is how the characters of Mr. Turner and Sean are

485
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,860
wildly different in what they represent in the real world.

486
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:15,860
Sean's experience is common enough that we could expect to see it in the real world today.

487
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:19,860
A kid who's told he'll never amount to anything because he's poorer then goes on to

488
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
live down to those expectations.

489
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,860
Mr. Turner is a teacher who takes an interest in helping that kid, which does certainly

490
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,860
happen in the real world, though he goes a lot farther than you would normally see, going

491
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:33,860
so far as to open his home to this kid so he'll have a safe place to stay.

492
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,860
When Sean's circumstances start getting bad, it's this extraordinarily uncommon

493
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:41,860
step that keeps him from running away into the unknown, away even from his friend Cory

494
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,860
and what little security he might have with the Matthews.

495
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:48,860
The contrast here reveals that Sean's ordinary life, with the destiny of failure

496
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:53,860
impressed upon him by society, requires extraordinary effort from a teacher to fix.

497
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,860
And what about the kids who aren't as lucky as Sean to have a teacher like Mr. Turner,

498
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,860
or even a friend like Cory?

499
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:02,860
The relationship between Sean and Mr. Turner continues to be explored in the third season

500
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:03,860
as the two bond.

501
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,860
We even get sweet moments like these where Sean tries to run away for the third time in the series.

502
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:33,860
By the end of the third season, it appeared as though Mr. Turner was finally going to

503
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:37,860
adopt Sean, but Sean can't turn his back on his father, and the two of them run style

504
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,860
and move back to the trailer park.

505
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:57,860
And so, the Mr. Turner experiment, at least when it came to taking care of Sean, came

506
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,860
to an end.

507
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:11,860
But there was more to the Mr. Turner character than taking care of Sean.

508
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:15,860
When he was first introduced in season 2, he also asked it as a foil to the more traditional

509
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:16,860
Mr. Feeney.

510
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:42,220
The season 2 premiere helped establish that dynamic in this moment.

511
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:44,820
This exchange raises an interesting question.

512
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:47,980
What is the best way to improve a person's understanding of the world?

513
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:51,500
Do we go to them on their own level, or do we demand that they come up to ours?

514
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,820
If you start low, you might not provide them with the supports they can pull themselves

515
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,620
up higher, but if you start high, they might not try to reach up at all.

516
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,580
One of the more interesting clashes between Mr. Feeney and Mr. Turner is in the episode

517
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:07,300
Wake Up, Little Cory, where Mr. Turner assigns his class to videotape each other talking

518
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:31,740
about love and sex.

519
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,060
Cory and Topanga partner up for this assignment.

520
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:37,140
After telling their parents they're staying at each other's homes, Cory and Topanga

521
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,620
spend the whole night editing footage at school, and then they fall asleep together, only to

522
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,380
be discovered later on.

523
00:34:43,380 --> 00:34:55,980
Cory soon becomes a legend at school.

524
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:17,100
On the other hand, Topanga's reputation is not so esteemed.

525
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:39,060
Meanwhile the two teachers discuss the fallout.

526
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,780
Cory then cuts together a version of their assignment that's more about love and sex,

527
00:35:42,780 --> 00:36:11,940
and includes a confession from him.

528
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:16,060
Cory and Topanga make up, but also important is how Mr. Feeney admits he might have been

529
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:22,580
wrong.

530
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,620
What makes this dynamic particularly interesting is that both teachers have a point.

531
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:30,620
The assignment did spiral out of control, and for a little while it made Topanga's

532
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,380
life horrible, but it was also in that diversity that Cory was able to rise to the occasion,

533
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,460
though it seems a bit unfair for him to have learned a lesson at the expense of someone

534
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,460
else.

535
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:43,820
It did reveal an important gender dynamic when it comes to sex and gossip, though, and

536
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:47,660
how it benefits the boys while hurting the girls, and that it was the side in power that

537
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,860
needed to learn the lesson, not the side that's victimized.

538
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,060
But above all the lessons learned in this episode, what caught my eye was how the clashing

539
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:58,340
styles of Mr. Feeney and Mr. Turner reveal that neither one is entirely right.

540
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:03,120
Mr. Turner overestimated how well the kids would handle talking about sex, and Mr. Feeney

541
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,620
underestimated them.

542
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:08,820
In these seasons, the series is very much about replacing the idea of the always wise

543
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,260
and unerring Mr. Feeney with an alternative to that style of teaching, suggesting that

544
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:17,180
it's not that kids can only learn through classic methods, but also the question on

545
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:21,940
how to educate kids is a negotiation between old and new techniques, ideally finding the

546
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:26,140
optimal may of moving forward by experimenting with what new stuff might work while holding

547
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,300
onto the old stuff that still does.

548
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:32,620
This episode also marks part of the small drift Cory and Topanga had towards one another

549
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,300
throughout the second season.

550
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,660
It wouldn't be happening all at once, but series creator Michael Jacobs explained this

551
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,140
was an idea he had early on.

552
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,300
I thought, what's going to happen with this boy confused by life?

553
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,660
What would be the stabilizing influences?

554
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:49,300
And I thought he would want to discover and find love forever, and we pretty much decided

555
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,660
early on that, wouldn't it be great if we could do a show about a kid who knew what

556
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,660
he wanted?

557
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:57,020
Fell in absolute love with somebody, and against every conceivable storyline we could come

558
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,860
up, they would make it work.

559
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:01,160
And that was something that we wanted early on.

560
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:05,300
The second season's second episode, pairing off, introduces the world of dating to the

561
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,420
series, and it would be a major focal point for the rest of its run.

562
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,140
It also signified that this show would be growing up alongside its characters and its

563
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,140
audience.

564
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:22,700
Topanga, my girl, my friend, my girly friend, believe me, I don't want this any more than

565
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,940
you do, but everybody around here is pairing off, and I think you and I should spare ourselves

566
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:29,940
a lot of uncoolness and walk through life together.

567
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,060
Cory and Topanga aren't quite ready to be a thing just yet.

568
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:38,820
Cory, when guys and girls go out, first they fall passionately in love, then after a week

569
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:43,020
they hate each other, so for one great passionate week we lose a friendship that could last

570
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,020
a lifetime.

571
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,020
I'm in if you are.

572
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:52,260
Cory, don't worry, I'm sure there's someone out there for you.

573
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,700
Give me a name!

574
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:58,420
Cory steps out in the world and has a few dates with other girls, though none of them lasts

575
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,420
for very long.

576
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,620
Although maybe he should have worked on his fashion sense a bit more, I'm not sure the

577
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:06,740
plaid shirt on top of another plaid shirt on top of a third shirt was really working

578
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:07,740
for him.

579
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:11,880
But while these other girls give Cory a taste of dating life, he's consistently drawn closer

580
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,280
to Topanga.

581
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,420
And it's in season 3 that we see Cory and Topanga get closer in the episode by best

582
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:43,180
friend's girl, where Shawn decides to push things along.

583
00:39:43,180 --> 00:40:05,180
Driven by jealousy, Cory finally asks out Topanga.

584
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:18,000
And of course Cory and Shawn remain bros.

585
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,540
As the Cory and Topanga relationship develops, we learn more about their history with one

586
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:36,340
another.

587
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:39,500
Cory and Topanga's history before the start of the show changes throughout the years,

588
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:43,700
but more important than the messy continuity is how these changing stories establish their

589
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:47,940
deep romantic connection, presenting young love as something eternally true.

590
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:51,660
A love story like this sticks out like a sore thumb, particularly in the present day

591
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:55,260
where most relationships have traded romanticism for realism.

592
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,380
It's probably here that the series feels most unreal, although it's done in a way

593
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,220
that isn't quite as simple as the fairy tale it's often remembered as.

594
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:07,180
Aside from Cory and Topanga needing two seasons to even start dating, they break up very quickly,

595
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,220
11 episodes later, and the grass is always greener.

596
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:36,740
It would be another 9 episodes before we see them reconcile when they go to Disney

597
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:56,060
World in The Happiest Show on Earth.

598
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:59,940
A cynical reading of an episode like this would be how Cory and Topanga are meant to

599
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:04,400
be together in so far that they are brought together by the corporate-fix simile of magic.

600
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,480
The needs for sitcom romances to end happily, and they reconcile in another corporate-fix

601
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,680
simile of magic, Disney World.

602
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,760
But I think it would be unfair to write this romance off entirely.

603
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,700
It took Cory and Topanga nearly two seasons to reach this point after all, struggling

604
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,040
to come to terms with their feelings and then making an effort to stay together.

605
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,240
And this would hardly be the storybook ending for the couple as they had more challenges

606
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,600
to come in the future.

607
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:29,480
The romanticism of this pairing confronts the harsh reality of the real world.

608
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:33,040
It's a small example of how idealism can survive the crushing weight of the cynical

609
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,160
world, but only if the people involved are willing to do the work to stay together.

610
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:39,840
And far from being perfect, they stumble and fall along the way.

611
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,840
That's what helps make this couple feel relatable.

612
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,880
They represent the good of the old that overcomes the challenges of the new.

613
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,920
The idea that love, when it's real, can overcome anything so long as you don't give

614
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:50,920
up on it.

615
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,520
A few notes before leaving these seasons.

616
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,040
There were several changes to the cast.

617
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:59,360
When the character Harley exits the series, he's briefly replaced by Adam Scott as Griff.

618
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,600
Griff wouldn't last long, and the bullies would be phased out of the series in later

619
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,600
seasons.

620
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:07,160
Season 3 also introduced the character Eli Williams to the principal cast, played by

621
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,400
Alex Dazer.

622
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,720
He was a friend of Mr. Turner and briefly a teacher at John Adams High School.

623
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:15,520
Though with Mr. Turner playing less of a role in Season 4, his friend exited the series

624
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,880
entirely at the end of Season 3.

625
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:21,560
The biggest departure was saying goodbye to the original Morgan in Season 2.

626
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:26,000
Lily Nixay was not terribly happy being on the show, so it was decided she would leave.

627
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,580
She would be replaced halfway through Season 3 by Lindsay Ridgeway.

628
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,460
As for why we didn't see Morgan for so long, she explained that it was a very long

629
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,460
time out.

630
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:54,100
And later in Season 3, we find out why she got that time out.

631
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:57,560
As Boy Meets World matured, so too did the type of stories it told.

632
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,560
The simpler ideas of listening to your teacher in the first season gave way to more complicated

633
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:04,040
relationships with authority in the second and third.

634
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:08,160
And through the character of Sean, class dynamics and expectations began to make their way through

635
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,920
the safe middle-class bubble we had first met him in.

636
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,280
In Season 4 and 5, this became increasingly more pronounced.

637
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,360
In particular, as more of Sean's family became part of the story.

638
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:21,720
With Mr. Turner out and Chet Hunter in, as Sean's father figure, we get a better sense

639
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,560
of where Sean came from and how that shaped him.

640
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:28,720
In Fishing for Verna, we meet Sean's mother Verna, played by Shireen Mitchell, ready to

641
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:53,920
try being a family again with the Hunter men.

642
00:44:53,920 --> 00:45:06,200
Chet tries to be a better father by getting a stable job as the school janitor.

643
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:09,280
Sean is eventually drawn into a fight with a kid mocking his father.

644
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:13,360
When Sean makes a trip to the principal's office, Mr. Feeny offers to fire Chet, knowing

645
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:17,240
Sean would eventually realize he doesn't want to take away his father's first steady

646
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:25,120
paycheck.

647
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,460
In addition to Sean learning an important lesson, what was particularly nice about this

648
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:33,200
episode was featuring someone working a janitorial job who doesn't, and shouldn't, feel any

649
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:41,960
shame about it.

650
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:45,640
That may not have been the best dad, but in the fourth season, he makes an effort to

651
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:49,560
be better, and that happens to start with working a job to support his family.

652
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:53,040
And it serves as a reminder that people's lives can take a number of turns for a variety

653
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:56,640
of reasons, whether it be a few bad choices or just some bad luck.

654
00:45:56,640 --> 00:46:00,160
It doesn't matter nearly as much as treating them with respect and acknowledging the hard

655
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,240
work they do.

656
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,920
This job isn't a punishment for Chet's mistakes, but an opportunity to start making

657
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,160
things right.

658
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,880
It also shows us that these are people with lives and families who take some pride in

659
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,120
enjoying their work.

660
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:14,960
The episode where Verna returned similarly took a moment to acknowledge the school cafeteria

661
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:19,560
lunch server as well, revealing how the Hunter family is strongly connected to working class

662
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:20,560
characters.

663
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,840
Although these are small gestures in the grand scheme of things, they are appreciated nonetheless.

664
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:29,840
Sean's family also offers a glimpse into more class dynamics when his parents depart,

665
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,960
and in the fifth season we meet Sean's half-brother, Jack, played by Matthew Lawrence.

666
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:38,280
Jack is not to be confused with Sean's other brother Eddie, who we briefly meet and then

667
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:42,280
never hear about again in the season 3 episode, The Pink Flamingo Kid.

668
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,820
Jack joins Boy Meets World in season 5 opener, Brothers, whereas Sean grew up in poverty

669
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:50,400
with their father, Jack lived comfortably with his mother and her new husband.

670
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,080
Although they have trouble getting along because of their time apart, they do at least partially

671
00:46:54,080 --> 00:47:04,720
reconcile by the end of the episode and move in together as Chet takes off once again.

672
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:07,920
And their other roommate is Cory's brother Eric.

673
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,360
Throughout the series, Jack's posh upbringing would create a divide between the two and

674
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,920
serve as a constant reminder of where these two characters came from.

675
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:18,360
Michael Jacobs explained the decision to include Jack in an interview saying,

676
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,160
"...Tony's character and Alex Dazer, who played Eli Williams, all of these wonderful

677
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,080
teachers were very beneficial to us, but it was always a coming-of-age comedy, and these

678
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:28,200
teachers had long since come-of-age.

679
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:32,200
But we felt that where the magnifying glass needed to be was on the generation that was

680
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,480
coming-of-age, and that's why we added Jack."

681
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,600
Over time, we would see less of these class dynamics as part of Sean's stories, as another

682
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:42,280
plotline would dominate his stories in later seasons, and Jack would appear more often

683
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:43,820
in stories with Eric.

684
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:47,640
But in these seasons, it was established that in the comfy middle-class space of Boy Meets

685
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:52,360
World, Sean would sometimes take the role of an outsider, his lower-class past and absent

686
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:55,520
parents reminding him that he doesn't quite fit in.

687
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,400
Another important addition to Sean's side of the stories was the arrival of Angela Moore,

688
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,800
played by Trina McGee.

689
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:03,960
Although just a random student in her first appearance, she would play a much bigger role

690
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:08,760
in the episode, I Love You Donna Karen, where Sean, growing dissatisfied with his two-week

691
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,080
limit dating life, falls for the owner of a lost purse.

692
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,680
"- And what if it's not as good as what I have now?"

693
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:17,480
"- With a purse?"

694
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:20,600
"- Just draw a bit, Corey.

695
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,040
Listen, what are you so afraid of?"

696
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:24,560
"- I'm afraid of getting hurt, okay?

697
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:28,360
I mean, I've seen the pain on my father's face every time a woman walks out because

698
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:29,920
he's not good enough."

699
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,440
"- Sean, you are not your father."

700
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:37,520
Sean later finds out the items in the purse belong to Angela, who he had just broken up

701
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,760
with, and he's suddenly filled with regrets.

702
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,680
And after a bit of back and forth on the subject, the two eventually begin dating once again,

703
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,560
only this time for longer than two weeks.

704
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,160
The relationship would be a part of the rest of season five, but it was later seasons that

705
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,560
we would more fully explore this dynamic.

706
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:56,640
As the series matured, it began tackling bigger social issues, so much so that a number of

707
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,200
episodes would be devoted to challenging topics.

708
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:03,520
In the episode, Dangerous Secret, Corey suspects Sean is hooking up with Claire, a girl in

709
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,400
her class, only to find out that Claire has been staying with Sean to get away from her

710
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,400
abusive father.

711
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
"- Okay, Claire and I aren't doing anything.

712
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,520
We never have.

713
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:15,520
The reason she's been staying at my place, her dad hits her.

714
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,200
What do you mean he hits her?

715
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,200
At night sometimes.

716
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,760
He yells a lot and beats her up."

717
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:25,680
Claire fears her father is untouchable, as he happens to be a bank vice president.

718
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,320
And even though the episode ends with Claire going to the police, it only holds the vague

719
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:32,440
hope that something might improve with her father going to therapy.

720
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,160
The story related back to the main cast in a more roundabout way.

721
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,880
When Corey thought Sean was having sex, he started pushing that line with Topanga, only

722
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:42,840
to realize he shouldn't base his decision on social pressure, but instead on whether

723
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,880
he and Topanga were both ready.

724
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:49,520
In cult fiction, feeling disconnected from the world, Sean decides to join a cult.

725
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,520
"- Do you believe in a mother and a father?

726
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:53,560
And a comfortable house and a comfortable street?

727
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,560
Because that's what you have?

728
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:56,520
Well, I don't have that.

729
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:58,000
So I found something with these people.

730
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,680
Yeah, but who are these people?

731
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,200
Stop trying to take away what I have.

732
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,440
I don't do that to you."

733
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,600
Eventually, when Mr. Turner is in a motorcycle accident, Corey talks some sense into Sean.

734
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:07,720
"- Turner took care of you.

735
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:08,800
He loves you.

736
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,040
And you love him.

737
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:12,680
Is that real?

738
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,240
Or are Mr. Mack in the center real?

739
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:18,040
You decide, but you cannot go."

740
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,640
This episode hits on the familiar Sean theme of feeling disconnected from the world and

741
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,980
the need for a home.

742
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:28,100
This episode is also, weirdly, the last time we see Mr. Turner in Boy Meets World.

743
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:32,860
And in If You Can't Be With The One You Love, Sean develops a drinking problem.

744
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:36,100
"- Nobody's listening to me, okay?

745
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:40,300
I drink this stuff because I like it.

746
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:42,460
It makes me feel good.

747
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:43,460
Hello?

748
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:44,460
Hello?

749
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:47,540
Is this thing on?

750
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,340
I have no problem."

751
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:55,780
"- Okay, maybe we don't have to talk about this in front of everybody.

752
00:50:55,780 --> 00:50:57,540
Let's just go out into the hall-"

753
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,540
"- Go."

754
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:06,100
"- I don't like that you drink.

755
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:11,060
Call me when you don't."

756
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:16,540
Aside from one relapse in a later season, Sean's alcoholism is largely wrapped up in this episode.

757
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,260
Most sitcoms have a small collection of very special episodes.

758
00:51:20,260 --> 00:51:24,580
Very special episodes being particularly dramatic episodes that tackle social issues.

759
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:28,380
But Boy Meets World seemed to have multiple very special episodes every season.

760
00:51:28,380 --> 00:51:31,660
For a family sitcom, it very aggressively went after these serious topics.

761
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:34,820
I might speak to why it continued to resonate over the years.

762
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,300
Boy Meets World did have a tendency to wrap these stories up a bit quickly.

763
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:43,260
Sean joining an escaping occult really leaps to mind as I wonder how such a traumatic event

764
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:45,900
could be encapsulated in a little over 20 minutes.

765
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:49,180
It's helped by playing to common themes of the character, but it still feels like

766
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,180
a stretch.

767
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:54,140
What these episodes reveal are a lot of good intentions beyond the capacity of a 20-minute

768
00:51:54,140 --> 00:51:58,220
family sitcom, even one that's relatively well put together like Boy Meets World.

769
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:00,500
It also reveals the limitations of its themes.

770
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:04,340
Unless the problem was simple and relatable, it didn't fit the format particularly well

771
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:07,820
and the ones that reached across multiple episodes tended to be more broad and less

772
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,900
specific than a drinking disorder.

773
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:13,300
It's also worth thinking about how these series began with the idea of school and other

774
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:16,320
places being safe staging grounds for these short lessons.

775
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:19,820
If these traumas persisted, it would change the tone of the show and make Boy Meets World

776
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:24,100
a very different experience, one that might have been too intense for its younger audience,

777
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:26,820
meaning they wouldn't see depictions of these issues at all.

778
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:31,540
There is no right or wrong answer in the best approach to very special episodes, just varying

779
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,220
degrees of success or failure based on the premise, characters, and theme a show has

780
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,560
to work with.

781
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:40,420
In these seasons, the show also started to drift towards more high-concept episodes,

782
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:44,260
that is, single episodes with a unique premise that allow the characters to be placed in

783
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:45,880
some strange contexts.

784
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:51,060
An early example from season 3 is I Was a Teenage Spy, where Cory is shocked by a microwave

785
00:52:51,060 --> 00:52:53,380
and sent back to the 1950s.

786
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,820
Do me a favor, would ya?

787
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:56,820
Anything you want.

788
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,820
Would ya look at me that way I don't like?

789
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:02,380
I thought you said it scared you.

790
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:04,380
It does.

791
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:10,940
It was a cute episode that foreshadowed Cory and Topanga getting back together during their

792
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:12,360
third season breakup.

793
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:17,520
In season 4's Sixteen Candles and Four Hundred Pound Men, Cory and Sean offer advice to Frankie

794
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:23,640
to better connect with his father, who happens to be WWF slash WWE wrestler Vader.

795
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:25,600
And they end up at a wrestling match.

796
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:30,400
And in Eric Hollywood, Eric is invited to join the cast of a sitcom called Kid Gets

797
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:34,840
Acquainted with Universe, where he meets a fictionalized version of the cast of the

798
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:55,600
show.

799
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,600
But the most popular high-concept episode of the series, and maybe the most popular episode

800
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:03,080
of the series, is season 5's And Then There Was Sean.

801
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:06,860
Loosely inspired by the Scream movies, this episode sees everyone trapped in the school

802
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:11,120
at night, with the murderer slowly picking them off, while Sean recounts various horror

803
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:30,440
movie tropes.

804
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:34,960
The episode isn't just unique in its premise, it's also shot to look more like a horror

805
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:35,960
movie.

806
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,520
With camera angles and movements you wouldn't usually see in a sitcom, it even had the gall

807
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:49,160
to murder Mr. Feeney.

808
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,840
The episode does a great job of playing with horror movie tropes and delivering some solid

809
00:54:52,840 --> 00:55:07,600
jokes.

810
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,340
It also included a special guest appearance from Jennifer Love Hewitt, who was seen in

811
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:13,960
I Know What You Did Last Summer a few months prior.

812
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:18,440
The episode was notoriously difficult to film because the cast broke down laughing for hours

813
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,280
at a time, but in spite of those difficulties, the finished product came together so well

814
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:24,040
that it became a fan favorite.

815
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,720
Part of the reason for Boy Meets World's success, and why the show is so often able

816
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:31,720
to take these kinds of chances, was because of its below-the-radar status.

817
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,560
Michael Jacobs was fairly protective of his show, and the network, rather than deal with

818
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,320
lengthy conversations about what the show was doing, let him do as he pleased so long

819
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,920
as the numbers were stable.

820
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:43,540
Ryder Strong describes how that influenced the audience.

821
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:47,240
When we stepped out of the box with an episode like this, it kind of felt like we were in

822
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:50,480
our own little corner of the playground, and no one was paying attention.

823
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,440
Which means, in a way, we were thumbing our nose at expanding our audience, and by definition,

824
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:57,000
building a cult following.

825
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,520
Even though, and then there was Sean was a bit of fun, it's still connected back to

826
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,520
one of the main through lines of the series in an important way.

827
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,200
By the end of the episode, the whole experience is revealed to be a bad dream of Sean's,

828
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,600
though in the dream, the killer is revealed to be Sean himself.

829
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,560
As for why he's killing his friends, it's revealed in this moment.

830
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,400
Why are you doing this to us?

831
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:23,040
Sean is tearing the world apart because he can't stand that Cory and Topanga have broken

832
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,040
up again.

833
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:28,080
Yes, broken up again, and that's as good a transition as any to give us a brief rundown

834
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:32,280
of what the fated couple of Cory and Topanga were doing in seasons 4 and 5.

835
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:35,440
At the end of season 3, our happy couple was still together, but they started facing

836
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:38,520
more hardships, part of the way through season 4.

837
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:43,080
In the two-parter, A Long Walk to Pittsburgh, Topanga is devastated to learn that her family

838
00:56:43,080 --> 00:56:47,400
is moving from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, putting her relationship with Cory in jeopardy.

839
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,320
Okay, I don't care if I have to walk to Pittsburgh, nothing is going to come between us, alright?

840
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,600
We're going to be together for the rest of our lives.

841
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:58,600
Okay.

842
00:56:58,600 --> 00:56:59,600
So there.

843
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,600
Cory's refusal to acknowledge the truth is tough to watch.

844
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,520
We're leaving for Pittsburgh.

845
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:10,360
No, you're not moving because we're supposed to be together like we've always talked about,

846
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:12,320
so you can't move.

847
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,280
Because we don't deserve that kind of pain.

848
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,400
Cory, will you just give me a hug and a kiss and say goodbye to me?

849
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:18,400
No.

850
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,600
Goodbye, Cory.

851
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,400
I love you.

852
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:36,800
As the weeks drag on and Cory's loved ones try to help him move on, he gets increasingly

853
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:40,240
frustrated not hearing from Topanga, and he's about ready to give up.

854
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:44,240
I'm sure you'll be real happy to know that I'm not going to go to Pittsburgh, okay?

855
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,880
Why not?

856
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:46,880
You and Topanga have a fight?

857
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:47,880
No, no fight.

858
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,400
I just realized that I'm the one making all the phone calls, I'm the one writing all

859
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,560
the letters, but I will not be the one who travels 300 miles to be rejected and look

860
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:55,560
like a fool.

861
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:59,240
So if life doesn't want me and Topanga together, then you can't fight life, can you?

862
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:02,240
Cory.

863
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,240
Amy.

864
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:06,880
This might be my favorite moment in the whole series.

865
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,600
Part of it is the reaction from the audience, and part of it is seeing how passionate young

866
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:11,600
love can be.

867
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:15,560
Topanga has run away from home, and even though Cory's parents aren't thrilled,

868
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:19,640
he offers his own definition of loved in an effort to keep them together.

869
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:27,080
When I'm better because she's here, now she won't be.

870
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,560
In other shows, this wouldn't be working.

871
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:32,640
It's so sweet, it's practically dripping honey.

872
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,880
But somehow Boy Meets World manages to walk this line without falling on its face.

873
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:40,520
It does require the audience to be willing to believe in Cory and Topanga, believe in

874
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:44,880
the idea of young love being something special that can last the test of time.

875
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,720
This feeling is only underscored when Topanga's aunt Prudence arrives, as she is played by

876
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,600
Olivia Hussie, who famously played Juliette, in 1968, Franco Ziffirelli's film adaptation

877
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,800
of Romeo and Juliette.

878
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,840
It's Topanga's aunt who offers her a place to stay in Philadelphia so she can spend

879
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:03,720
her last year of high school in the place she's familiar with, among her friends,

880
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:06,140
and most importantly, with Cory.

881
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:09,320
This might have been the best episode for the Cory and Topanga relationship, even though

882
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:14,040
it's complete fantasy, unbearably sentimental, and still somehow works.

883
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:18,000
It's the comfort you don't get with the more cynical TV that was popularized in later

884
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,000
years.

885
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:22,480
Maybe this is why it's such a strong symbol of youth and nostalgia, when we believe true

886
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,480
life could happen at 16, and nothing was more important than being with the person you cared

887
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,880
the most about.

888
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:32,080
Cory and Topanga are see-sawing between fantasy and reality, and after a bit of fantasy in

889
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,960
season 4, it would swing back to reality in season 5.

890
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:41,200
In Heartbreak Cory, the senior class goes on a ski trip to Mount Sun Lodge, where Cory

891
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:45,040
sprains his ankle getting off the bus, leaving him at the lodge while everyone else goes

892
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:46,040
skiing.

893
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:57,040
Keeping him company is Lauren, played by Linda Cardellini, an employee at the lodge.

894
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,960
Cory ends up talking with Lauren throughout the night, and on the next day lies about

895
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:04,160
his ankle still being sore, so he's once again trapped at the lodge.

896
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:05,160
With Lauren.

897
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:20,240
I wasn't expecting you, but sometimes people take you by surprise.

898
01:00:20,240 --> 01:00:24,360
Cory tells the truth to Topanga about having spent the night talking to Lauren, but he

899
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,520
leaves out the part about the kiss.

900
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:30,840
Cory says goodbye to Lauren, though she leaves him with a letter, which Topanga finds at

901
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,120
the end of the episode.

902
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,720
Topanga confronts Cory about the letter in the next episode, and in the episode after

903
01:00:35,720 --> 01:01:01,560
that one, torn between two lovers, feeling like a fool, Lauren shows up in Philadelphia.

904
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:06,000
Topanga tells Cory that if he isn't 100% sure about the two of them, he should spend

905
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,320
some time with Lauren.

906
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:10,120
So he does, and he spends the day talking to Lauren.

907
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:12,320
Later on, Cory makes his decision.

908
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,600
I like Lauren.

909
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:19,280
I like spending time with her.

910
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:23,840
But I can live without her.

911
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:30,560
I can't live without Topanga.

912
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,320
It's no contest.

913
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,000
And then he talks to Topanga about the experience.

914
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:37,760
Cory, I can't see you anymore.

915
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:38,760
What?

916
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:46,280
Do you have any idea how many guys sit on me?

917
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:52,200
What are you talking about?

918
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:55,840
I never needed to test my feelings for you.

919
01:01:55,840 --> 01:02:01,680
I moved away from my parents in Pittsburgh to be close to you, but that you needed to

920
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:06,000
see her to test how you felt about me.

921
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,280
I don't forgive you for that, Cory.

922
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:09,280
No.

923
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:10,280
No.

924
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,280
You told me to see her, Topanga.

925
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:18,840
You told me to see how I felt.

926
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:26,640
And you listened.

927
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:41,600
It's going to be okay.

928
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:46,360
No, I won't.

929
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:50,360
What made this breakup so powerful was that it was a slow build over three episodes.

930
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,840
A couple like Cory and Topanga can't end things with a single fight.

931
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:58,860
It took time, and a series of bad choices, and when it ends, it feels like a real ending.

932
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:02,840
This is the episode that proceeded, and then there was Sean.

933
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:06,520
Episodes like these are in stark contrast to the more idyllic ones where Topanga goes

934
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:10,160
to Cory in the rain, or the heartfelt moment in Topanga's room.

935
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:14,240
It's a reminder that even supposedly perfect relationships are a lot of work, and that

936
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:17,000
it's better to be honest than hide something from your partner.

937
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:21,040
It'll also reflect how the series has changed the lessons it was teaching, moving from stories

938
01:03:21,040 --> 01:03:24,800
about fitting into the wider world to how people fit into each other's lives.

939
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:27,480
And the lessons are getting more complex and messy.

940
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,520
That's why the stories have drifted away from the nice, tidy lessons learned at the

941
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,600
close of each episode to lingering doubts and confusion.

942
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:37,580
It reflects how some parts of the world aren't so easily learned from a speech delivered

943
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:39,080
by Mr. Feeney.

944
01:03:39,080 --> 01:03:42,560
But the Cory and Topanga story didn't end here.

945
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:47,880
In Story Night, Topanga meets a guy named Ricky, played by Jonathan Jackson, and is

946
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,440
taken by his deep love of art.

947
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:54,400
Unsure of whether or not she's ready to move on, she tries taking Cory to see Van Gogh's

948
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,400
story night to get his impression of the piece.

949
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:38,840
Topanga isn't satisfied with Cory's answer.

950
01:04:38,840 --> 01:05:03,080
Topanga decides to go out with Ricky, and when they kiss, she learns something.

951
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:32,200
And

952
01:05:32,200 --> 01:05:51,160
all that's left is for them to get back together.

953
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:54,840
With Cory and Topanga reconciled, the rest of the season will supposedly play out just

954
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:58,080
fine until they're faced with one more challenge.

955
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:02,160
When things change, Topanga's offers a spot at Yale, which dashed the plans she's made

956
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:18,400
with Cory to attend Penbrook University together.

957
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:21,440
Cory tells Topanga she should take the chance to go to Yale.

958
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:25,100
And in the season 5 finale, Graduation, Cory and his friends prepare to end their high

959
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:49,340
school lives, and we get a cute cameo for Minkus.

960
01:06:49,340 --> 01:07:10,140
More importantly, though, we find out what Topanga's decision is regarding Yale.

961
01:07:10,140 --> 01:07:23,740
As far as sitcom cliffhangers go, the unanswered proposal is a classic.

962
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:27,460
And had this couple not just been put through the wringer for the last 10 episodes, it might

963
01:07:27,460 --> 01:07:29,260
have felt like it was coming out of nowhere.

964
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,820
But in this case, it felt entirely natural.

965
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:35,820
Part of that reason is because Cory and Topanga's relationship has always been too idyllic,

966
01:07:35,820 --> 01:07:38,780
so said in a romantic fantasy that it was hard to take seriously.

967
01:07:38,780 --> 01:07:41,940
But in seasons 4 and 5, it started to feel more real.

968
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:45,580
The challenges were more difficult, and the answers were less obvious or certain.

969
01:07:45,580 --> 01:07:49,820
These were the seasons that pulled that relationship into the real world, to test its ability to

970
01:07:49,820 --> 01:07:50,820
survive.

971
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:54,560
And after going through some tough trials, it proved that it was the real thing.

972
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:59,260
But this is a relationship built on an amorphous past, one that seemed destined.

973
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:03,060
But the only reason it was destined is because of the traditional sentimentality that went

974
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:04,060
into making the show.

975
01:08:04,060 --> 01:08:08,300
Boy Meets World is a very earnest series, not shined away from sensitive issues or social

976
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:09,300
commentary.

977
01:08:09,300 --> 01:08:12,380
But at its heart, it's still a very traditional family sitcom.

978
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:15,340
It has one foot in the present and another in the past.

979
01:08:15,340 --> 01:08:19,580
The show itself manifests this in the dynamic between Mr. Feeny and Mr. Turner in season

980
01:08:19,580 --> 01:08:20,580
2.

981
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:24,700
This show is about how children become adults, and the forces of constancy and change that

982
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:25,780
shape them.

983
01:08:25,780 --> 01:08:30,260
And in this maelstrom of forces, Cory and Topanga make it through, with their romanticized

984
01:08:30,260 --> 01:08:35,180
version of love staying intact, now hardened by the harsh winds of reality.

985
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:38,260
And ultimately, this might be the perfect symbol as to why this show became such a

986
01:08:38,260 --> 01:08:39,660
comforting favorite.

987
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,900
Because it tells you that through all the noise and fury, so long as you really work

988
01:08:42,900 --> 01:09:02,500
at it, everything is going to be okay.

989
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:06,660
To then keep everyone hanging, let's make one thing perfectly clear.

990
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:27,580
Here is Cory's answer to Topanga's proposal.

991
01:09:27,580 --> 01:09:28,980
That's a yes, by the way.

992
01:09:28,980 --> 01:09:32,580
While I tease a quick wedding afterwards, ultimately Cory and Topanga decide to have

993
01:09:32,580 --> 01:09:34,420
a long engagement instead.

994
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:38,500
There are plenty of other changes in store for the cast in these final two seasons, aside

995
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:41,460
from the impending nuptials.

996
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:47,180
Most obviously, we see Cory, Topanga, Sean, and Angela all heading off to Penbrook University.

997
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:51,740
Cory and Sean become roommates in their dorm while Topanga and Angela do the same in their

998
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,740
dorm.

999
01:09:52,740 --> 01:09:55,460
And this might be a good time to look at some of the other characters that are joining at

1000
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:56,460
Penbrook.

1001
01:09:56,460 --> 01:10:00,460
In the last five seasons, Eric Matthews has gone through a bit of a transformation.

1002
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:04,980
In earlier seasons, he was the cool order brother who always had a new date every week,

1003
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:09,500
but as the seasons progressed, that changed as the character became increasingly more

1004
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:10,500
silly.

1005
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:14,380
According to Will Friedle, the first sign of this was in the first season, when he got

1006
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:17,100
the chance to be in a scene with William Daniels.

1007
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:35,420
And he had to think of a funny way of throwing down a bag of fertilizer.

1008
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:39,900
The lesson learned was to always go big in comedy, and over the years we would see Eric

1009
01:10:39,900 --> 01:11:08,100
going further and further over the top.

1010
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:11,780
One fan theory as to why this is happening is because the series is told through the

1011
01:11:11,780 --> 01:11:16,260
eyes of Cory, and part of growing up is seeing your cool, hip, older brother for the goofball

1012
01:11:16,260 --> 01:11:17,500
he really is.

1013
01:11:17,500 --> 01:11:21,220
And while I would never rob someone of their interpretation, according to Friedle, behind

1014
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:25,500
the scenes it was about the writers and Will Friedle challenging each other to get increasingly

1015
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:29,900
ridiculous with the character, making him more akin to Friedle in real life, albeit

1016
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,140
amped up some.

1017
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:35,380
So in the final seasons, he would be completely off the wall, like coughing out winning lottery

1018
01:11:35,380 --> 01:12:03,620
numbers or disguising himself as a couch, but Eric not always being a perfect fit in

1019
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:07,260
the Cory, Shawn, Topanga, and eventually Angela dynamic.

1020
01:12:07,260 --> 01:12:11,700
Eric was given his own supporting cast, first with the arrival of Shawn's brother Jack,

1021
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:16,580
who became Eric's roommate, along with Shawn, and then in season 6, when Shawn moved out,

1022
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:20,980
a new roommate replaced him, Rachel McGuire, played by Maitland Ward.

1023
01:12:20,980 --> 01:12:23,220
Michael Jacobs explains this evolution.

1024
01:12:23,220 --> 01:12:26,660
We knew that Eric was succeeding beautifully as a character, but we also knew that Eric

1025
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:29,320
only involved with Shawn and Cory seemed odd.

1026
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,420
We knew that what Eric really needed was something to play off of, and Matthew Lawrence was available

1027
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:34,860
and it was a no-brainer to me.

1028
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:38,420
And we put them together and then decided to add Maitland Ward, and all of a sudden

1029
01:12:38,420 --> 01:12:41,340
we had these wonderful secondary stories.

1030
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:45,580
The typical dynamic here was Eric and Jack fighting over the beautiful Rachel, though

1031
01:12:45,580 --> 01:13:01,780
ultimately it was Jack who got the upper hand because it was funnier to see Eric fail.

1032
01:13:01,780 --> 01:13:05,760
Many of the beeplaws were basic stories and thinly-veiled excuses to give Will Friedel

1033
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:07,560
something funny to do on camera.

1034
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:11,380
Occasionally we would see Eric in some more mysterious stories, such as when he nearly

1035
01:13:11,380 --> 01:13:13,980
adopted a young boy named Tommy he was mentoring.

1036
01:13:13,980 --> 01:13:17,920
But generally speaking, Eric's stories were fun college adventures.

1037
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:21,080
What Eric best represents, though, is the persistence of friendship.

1038
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:24,540
Although his friendships with Jack and Rachel aren't as pronounced as, say, the Cory and

1039
01:13:24,540 --> 01:13:29,640
Shawn friendship, Eric is unusually talented when it comes to understanding people and

1040
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:30,640
friendships.

1041
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:35,400
As a 7-2 parter, the first episode titled The War, we see the bonds of this group tested

1042
01:13:35,400 --> 01:13:40,340
during a series of increasingly harsh pranks – Jack, Rachel, and Angela make up one team

1043
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:43,360
with Cory, Shawn, and Topanga on the other team.

1044
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:45,920
Eric is left out because no one wants him on their team.

1045
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:49,720
Eventually, things get taken too far when Cory and Shawn put up a revealing picture

1046
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:52,000
of Rachel in the Student Union.

1047
01:13:52,000 --> 01:14:14,320
The prank war turns into a fight, and Cory makes an unfortunate comment.

1048
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:37,280
And things ripple out from there.

1049
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:50,000
Eric tries to make peace between everyone, and then finds out the truth.

1050
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:54,620
In the second part, titled Seven the Hard Way, Eric puts aside his bruised ego to work

1051
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:57,820
with Mr. Feeny to try and mend these broken friendships.

1052
01:15:24,620 --> 01:15:45,900
Even the closest to friends, Cory and Shawn, might not be able to hold it together.

1053
01:15:45,900 --> 01:16:02,140
The episode flashes forward seven years to Mr. Feeny's retirement party to reveal that

1054
01:16:02,140 --> 01:16:29,100
this fight shattered the group.

1055
01:16:29,100 --> 01:16:48,900
And then Eric arrives.

1056
01:16:48,900 --> 01:17:07,260
And Plays with Squirrels has some words of wisdom.

1057
01:17:07,260 --> 01:17:11,020
When the episode goes back to the present day, it moves to a few moments after Rachel

1058
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:36,300
is left, and Eric drags her back to read those same words of wisdom.

1059
01:17:36,300 --> 01:17:38,900
And it inspires everyone to reconcile.

1060
01:17:38,900 --> 01:17:42,140
Although Eric can never escape being the goofball, he holds together people much in

1061
01:17:42,140 --> 01:17:44,620
the same way he holds together the series itself.

1062
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:48,420
If Boy Meets World was a series of tragedies, the characters would likely not be able to

1063
01:17:48,420 --> 01:17:52,140
keep their connection to one another, and the series itself could never maintain its

1064
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:54,300
premise as a family-friendly sitcom.

1065
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:58,060
Eric is the glue for all of these things, providing consistent comedic relief, and also

1066
01:17:58,060 --> 01:18:01,420
providing the wisdom needed to hold these characters together in the context of the

1067
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:02,420
show.

1068
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:05,900
For all the troubles that visit these characters, Eric is the Oasis in the Desert, a place to

1069
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:10,660
enjoy a break from the heat, and he's an oasis for characters and audiences alike.

1070
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:14,460
And in that calm, a simple truth can come from an unexpected place.

1071
01:18:14,460 --> 01:18:19,760
A character like Eric is particularly necessary when Boy Meets World gets heavy, and the heaviest

1072
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:23,040
season was, almost certainly, season 6.

1073
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,280
When Sean and Jack's father Chet returns in the episode, We'll Have a Good Time Then,

1074
01:18:27,280 --> 01:18:29,640
he announces that this time, he's staying for good.

1075
01:18:29,640 --> 01:18:33,200
From now on, there'll be lots and lots of time for us to play in pool.

1076
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,000
So you're really staying for good?

1077
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:36,000
That's the plan, son.

1078
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:39,640
Sean is skeptical that Chet is going to be a run for the long haul, and in many ways

1079
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,960
sees himself in Chet's lack of commitment.

1080
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:46,040
Chet doesn't get the chance to prove himself, though, as he soon has a heart attack.

1081
01:18:46,040 --> 01:18:48,720
Sean and Jack don't handle it particularly well.

1082
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:43,200
Sean and Chet do get a moment to reconcile, though.

1083
01:19:43,200 --> 01:20:02,040
But sadly, it's a little too late to make things right, as Chet has a second heart attack

1084
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:09,200
and passes away.

1085
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,780
Nothing is really resolved in this episode, and in some ways that might be an incredibly

1086
01:20:12,780 --> 01:20:17,460
realistic depiction of death, it doesn't solve problems or end a chapter.

1087
01:20:17,460 --> 01:20:20,300
Even if people reconcile, there's no time to enjoy that peace.

1088
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,900
It's a sudden departure that comes too soon, no matter how late it may be.

1089
01:20:24,900 --> 01:20:38,820
Feeling lost, Sean once again takes off on a journey to discover himself.

1090
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:42,760
What eventually brings Sean back two episodes later is the need to comfort his friend Corey

1091
01:20:42,760 --> 01:20:44,960
during a difficult time.

1092
01:20:44,960 --> 01:20:49,240
Before we begin, a quick content warning for anyone with a challenging pregnancy or infancy,

1093
01:20:49,240 --> 01:20:51,360
you can skip ahead to the timestamp below.

1094
01:20:51,360 --> 01:20:55,640
Amy Matthews revealed she was pregnant at the end of season 5, and in season 6, that

1095
01:20:55,640 --> 01:20:58,200
pregnancy was coming to an early end.

1096
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:18,040
The baby was delivered early and is left in critical condition.

1097
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,840
The next episode pulls no punches with several trips to the infant intensive care unit, and

1098
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:26,080
it doesn't just highlight the struggle of the young Matthews baby.

1099
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:29,880
Someone speaks to and gets to know the other parents who are going through the same thing,

1100
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:50,440
including an uncredited cameo by series creator Michael Jacobs.

1101
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:54,560
What I appreciate in this scene is how it acknowledges that many parents struggle with

1102
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:56,040
this reality every day.

1103
01:21:56,040 --> 01:21:59,640
It isn't just a thing that the Matthews family come across one day to be conveniently

1104
01:21:59,640 --> 01:22:02,040
forgotten about when the show moves on.

1105
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:06,440
The presence of the other families also carries with them in the awful suggestion that not

1106
01:22:06,440 --> 01:22:08,000
all babies can make it.

1107
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:12,880
This is particularly clear in the revelation that, at least in this case, Joshua Matthews

1108
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:37,280
is going to make it.

1109
01:22:37,280 --> 01:22:41,400
For all the difficulties the characters face in Boy Meets World, this one was probably

1110
01:22:41,400 --> 01:22:43,720
the most grueling and difficult to watch.

1111
01:22:43,720 --> 01:22:53,040
And it makes moments of levity even more of a relief.

1112
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:57,300
What these heavy episodes also reveal is the greater dynamic for the series and its approach

1113
01:22:57,300 --> 01:22:59,760
to teaching its young audience about the world.

1114
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:03,840
It began with familiar, well-known things that were taught to the kids, moved on to

1115
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:09,400
things that were mysterious and a little uncertain, and then began moving towards the unexpected

1116
01:23:09,400 --> 01:23:10,400
unknown.

1117
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:14,360
And it's a subject people never see coming, like the sudden early death of a parent or

1118
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:16,920
a child being born in critical condition.

1119
01:23:16,920 --> 01:23:20,440
The stakes continuously go up in the series, revealing that the world is an increasingly

1120
01:23:20,440 --> 01:23:24,080
challenging place, and it can throw anything at you and you'll have to learn how to deal

1121
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:26,520
with it, and hopefully learn from the experience.

1122
01:23:26,520 --> 01:23:29,600
The learning area isn't the safe space of the classroom anymore.

1123
01:23:29,600 --> 01:23:33,640
Although Boy Meets World had gotten incredibly heavy in these later seasons, it wasn't just

1124
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,680
a series of unending traumas.

1125
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:39,360
One bright spot was the impending marriage of Kori and Topanga, albeit with a few more

1126
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:40,640
bumps along the way.

1127
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:44,960
By the end of the perpetually-heavy season 6, we got to see the blossoming relationship

1128
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:47,720
between Mr. Feeny and Dean Bolander.

1129
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:52,560
Mr. Feeny having gone from fellow student at Penbrook University to one of the professors.

1130
01:23:52,560 --> 01:23:56,720
Because of course, Kori and his friends need Mr. Feeny to teach them through every year

1131
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:57,720
of their education.

1132
01:23:57,720 --> 01:24:02,280
Dean Bolander was also played by William Daniels' real-life wife, Bonnie Bartlett.

1133
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:05,040
Ahead of their marriage, Topanga finds out her parents are getting divorced, leading

1134
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,560
Topanga devout her own engagement.

1135
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:10,880
Season 7 opens with a two-parter where Kori tries to repair the relationship between

1136
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,480
Topanga's parents, only to realize that sometimes love does die.

1137
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:17,840
And while once again it may seem like this relationship is over, Kori and Topanga manage

1138
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:22,360
to reconcile, when Topanga's mother tells her that even with the tragic end, love is

1139
01:24:22,360 --> 01:24:23,560
still worth it.

1140
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,920
What can I do to make it up to you?

1141
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:27,760
You could move your knee.

1142
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:28,760
Sorry.

1143
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:33,560
Whatever life takes us, I want it to be with you.

1144
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:34,560
Forever.

1145
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:38,560
Of all the breakups Kori and Topanga went through, this one was perhaps the least believable.

1146
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:41,760
Largely because they had already called things quits three times before, and the appearance

1147
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,660
of Lauren was a far more convincing threat than Topanga losing faith in love.

1148
01:24:45,660 --> 01:24:49,360
With their relationship so obviously solid, a wedding was the only place this story could

1149
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:50,360
go.

1150
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,240
And go there it did, albeit with some resistance from the network.

1151
01:24:53,240 --> 01:24:57,080
Michael Jacobs tells the story of how he convinced the network to let this happen.

1152
01:24:57,080 --> 01:25:00,840
The head of ABC, when I told them we were going to marry them at 19, said it was a very

1153
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:04,040
irresponsible thing to do and that the audience didn't want it.

1154
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:07,460
And I said to him, listen, you have this thing called abc.com.

1155
01:25:07,460 --> 01:25:08,460
It was brand new.

1156
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,680
Why don't you run a graphic and find out how many people are waiting for Kori and Topanga

1157
01:25:11,680 --> 01:25:12,680
to marry?

1158
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:16,240
And so he said, it's ridiculous, we'll get maybe 20,000 hits and that's it.

1159
01:25:16,240 --> 01:25:17,900
And who can tell anything from that?

1160
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:19,480
And I said, why don't we try it?

1161
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:24,380
And in the first seven minutes, they got about 280,000 hits and then the thing broke.

1162
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:29,840
And out of the 280,000 hits, 280,000 people said, what do you think we're waiting for?

1163
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,720
I got a call from the president of the network the next day who said, could you please marry

1164
01:25:33,720 --> 01:25:35,180
them in sweeps?

1165
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:38,440
The week before the wedding, there was a cute tie-in during the credits for that week's

1166
01:25:38,440 --> 01:25:39,440
episode.

1167
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:43,080
Kori and Topanga spoke about a website set up to celebrate their upcoming nuptials.

1168
01:25:43,080 --> 01:25:47,440
There's something very charming about how simple and quaint a website like this is.

1169
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:53,200
And finally, in an episode titled, It's About Time, we see Kori and Topanga married.

1170
01:25:53,200 --> 01:25:57,320
Even though it's Kori and Topanga's wedding, the episode is actually about another important

1171
01:25:57,320 --> 01:25:59,760
relationship, Kori and Sean.

1172
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:05,800
As far as you and me go, today is the last day that we're ever going to be Kori and Sean.

1173
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:09,360
You know, Sean and Kori?

1174
01:26:09,360 --> 01:26:10,760
The fight runs into the wedding.

1175
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,640
We have to talk about it.

1176
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:16,560
I don't want to.

1177
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,200
We have to.

1178
01:26:19,200 --> 01:26:23,280
Now?

1179
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:28,960
Kori, after you get married, things are going to be different.

1180
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:31,840
And I don't have a lot of friends, you know?

1181
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:34,840
Do you really like her?

1182
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:40,400
Yeah, I really do.

1183
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:42,240
You sure?

1184
01:26:42,240 --> 01:26:48,080
John, I really think I've been very tolerant here.

1185
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:50,760
Kori and Sean talk it out, and the wedding moves forward.

1186
01:26:50,760 --> 01:26:54,040
It's very strange that this wedding episode is about the guys.

1187
01:26:54,040 --> 01:26:57,960
It also highlights how important this friendship is to Kori, and how a marriage would change

1188
01:26:57,960 --> 01:26:58,960
that dynamic.

1189
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:02,000
They're still best friends, but it's not quite the same anymore.

1190
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:05,800
The Kori and Sean friendship can't really be understated, though it relies perhaps on

1191
01:27:05,800 --> 01:27:09,960
a few too many gay jokes about them, clearly written before the writers knew what the internet

1192
01:27:09,960 --> 01:27:11,720
did with that kind of bait.

1193
01:27:11,720 --> 01:27:15,480
It's still nice to see a male relationship that's not just about broing down and watching

1194
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,880
the game together.

1195
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:20,240
Kori and Sean support each other emotionally through some of the toughest parts of their

1196
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,920
lives, and anyone would be lucky to have a friend like either one of them.

1197
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:25,680
And it's a simple yet true lesson.

1198
01:27:25,680 --> 01:27:28,800
If you find a good friend who will stick with you during those tough times, hold on

1199
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:30,360
to them as best you can.

1200
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:33,640
It's one of the bittersweet moments of a wedding, knowing that this is the end of one

1201
01:27:33,640 --> 01:27:35,400
era and the beginning of another.

1202
01:27:35,400 --> 01:27:39,200
The series could have easily ended on this note, but it kept moving forward into a wider

1203
01:27:39,200 --> 01:27:41,480
unknown, the life of a married couple.

1204
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:44,840
In The Honeymoon is Over, Kori and Topanga struggle to find housing.

1205
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:48,520
They realize they don't have a place to live, with Topanga's apartment and Kori's

1206
01:27:48,520 --> 01:27:50,160
dorm conveniently occupied.

1207
01:27:50,160 --> 01:27:52,000
They go to Alan and Amy for help.

1208
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:53,000
Amy?

1209
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:54,800
They can't stay here.

1210
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:55,920
They're married now.

1211
01:27:55,920 --> 01:27:59,760
It's Kori and Topanga, not Kori and us.

1212
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:00,760
Remember?

1213
01:28:02,760 --> 01:28:03,760
Ma?

1214
01:28:03,760 --> 01:28:06,600
You can't stay here, Kori.

1215
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:10,560
It seems pretty harsh for Kori's parents not to offer any kind of assistance here,

1216
01:28:10,560 --> 01:28:14,400
even a roof over their heads for a few days, especially when the alternative is for Kori

1217
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,360
and Topanga to live in the dorm for married couples, which looks like this.

1218
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:23,920
Why a university dorm is in shambles, I'm not entirely sure, but it clearly doesn't

1219
01:28:23,920 --> 01:28:28,320
matter for us, so Kori goes back to his father to once again ask for help.

1220
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,880
You decided that you were old enough to get married.

1221
01:28:30,880 --> 01:28:36,080
You decided to take on the responsibility of a new life because you believed you could

1222
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:38,520
handle it.

1223
01:28:38,520 --> 01:28:46,480
And this family supported that decision after we told you that it was going to be very difficult.

1224
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,680
What did you think we were kidding?

1225
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:53,120
I had many thoughts while watching this episode, but it would be unfair to discuss without

1226
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:56,080
quickly running down the next one – picket fences.

1227
01:28:56,080 --> 01:29:00,360
The method to Alan's madness is explained in a later scene where Sean thinks the place

1228
01:29:00,360 --> 01:29:13,880
is nice, just in need of some work to fix it up a bit.

1229
01:29:13,880 --> 01:29:17,480
When Kori makes an effort to fix things up, he and Topanga gradually start to think they

1230
01:29:17,480 --> 01:29:20,200
can turn this rundown apartment into a home.

1231
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:21,520
And a lesson is learned.

1232
01:29:21,520 --> 01:29:24,720
Topanga and I are going to pay in our place, we're going to put up a bookshelf, and

1233
01:29:24,720 --> 01:29:28,320
someday when we can afford it, we are going to buy that house with a nook without your

1234
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,320
help.

1235
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:32,400
Now, what do you have to say to that?

1236
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,920
I'd say you finally figured it out.

1237
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:38,880
Welcome to being an adult.

1238
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:43,760
When your mother and I got married, we had nothing.

1239
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:46,280
Nobody would help us, we did fine.

1240
01:29:46,280 --> 01:29:49,840
We didn't know it then, but it was the sweetest time in our lives.

1241
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,780
We bonded together forever.

1242
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:56,120
We felt completely in love because we knew we made a life for ourselves with nobody's

1243
01:29:56,120 --> 01:29:58,800
help but our own.

1244
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,640
I would never take that away from you, son.

1245
01:30:01,640 --> 01:30:04,440
These two episodes are ridiculous.

1246
01:30:04,440 --> 01:30:08,120
In the first one, we find out what was fairly obvious throughout the series' run.

1247
01:30:08,120 --> 01:30:10,040
Kori and Topanga are upper middle class.

1248
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:13,680
We're upper middle class, homeless college students.

1249
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:16,680
And this lesson makes it abundantly clear.

1250
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:20,800
The idea that suffering together through poverty is some kind of bonding ritual is

1251
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,520
unbelievably privileged.

1252
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:25,240
I want to look at how these episodes don't actually work.

1253
01:30:25,240 --> 01:30:29,080
The first question we should be asking is, who's paying for this dorm?

1254
01:30:29,080 --> 01:30:31,360
And who was paying for their previous dorm?

1255
01:30:31,360 --> 01:30:35,200
Neither Kory nor Topanga seem to have jobs, though they would in a few episodes.

1256
01:30:35,200 --> 01:30:39,080
They're also attending universities, something I imagine they aren't paying for with whatever

1257
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,080
savings they have.

1258
01:30:40,080 --> 01:30:44,720
So it sounds like their parents are still taking care of at least some of those expenses.

1259
01:30:44,720 --> 01:30:47,840
For this story to be true to the message it's trying to present, Kori and Topanga

1260
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,080
would be moving to their own place and having to get jobs to pay for everything, including

1261
01:30:52,080 --> 01:30:54,160
school, while attending.

1262
01:30:54,160 --> 01:30:58,520
This is a very hefty burden to put on someone, and expecting them to fix up their rundown

1263
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,080
apartment on top of that.

1264
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:04,640
How is this episode not about the absurd financial demands of obtaining a higher education, or

1265
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:07,720
even just surviving in the modern world when you reach 20?

1266
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:11,660
Clearly this real world experience isn't entirely real.

1267
01:31:11,660 --> 01:31:16,340
It seems more like a game for an upper-middle-class family to play at what it means to be poor,

1268
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:19,580
and this little exercise is supposed to build character.

1269
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:23,980
Except, there are people who live just the way Kory and Topanga would have to, working

1270
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:28,380
and going to school while trying to keep a crummy apartment from collapsing in on itself.

1271
01:31:28,380 --> 01:31:31,880
And not because their parents want to teach them a lesson, it's because it's simply

1272
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:35,900
a fact of their life, they don't have the means of affording anything better.

1273
01:31:35,900 --> 01:31:39,820
The biggest failure of this episode is to only fleetingly acknowledge that there are

1274
01:31:39,820 --> 01:31:42,360
people in situations such as Kory and Topanga.

1275
01:31:42,360 --> 01:31:46,540
Their neighbors are in rough spots, and they're at least depicted with some sensitivity, but

1276
01:31:46,540 --> 01:31:50,060
we don't get much acknowledgement from Kory and Topanga of how there seems to be something

1277
01:31:50,060 --> 01:31:53,660
wrong in a world where people are forced to live in rough conditions, because society

1278
01:31:53,660 --> 01:31:58,000
has made education a commodity easily purchased by the wealthy, and only attainable through

1279
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,060
back-breaking effort for the poor.

1280
01:32:00,060 --> 01:32:04,020
If Allen and Amy's Grand Lesson had been instead to teach their kids about the injustice

1281
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:07,800
in the world they had been sheltering them from, they would have made more sense.

1282
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:11,240
It would still be harsh, of course, but it would be wisdom worth having.

1283
01:32:11,240 --> 01:32:16,080
The bonding exercise excuse seems like, at best, a rationalization, and the better lesson

1284
01:32:16,080 --> 01:32:18,960
learned from this episode is the unspoken one.

1285
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:22,600
The seventh season was halfway through at this point, and while we'd see more of Kory

1286
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:26,040
and Topanga's married life, including their first fight, there is another couple that

1287
01:32:26,040 --> 01:32:27,920
should be visited instead.

1288
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:32,520
Angela and Sean's relationship is, much like Kory and Topanga's, a turbulent one.

1289
01:32:32,520 --> 01:32:36,040
Although unlike Kory and Topanga, their time apart is much longer.

1290
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:40,560
At the beginning of season six, Angela and Sean break up, and manage to stay broken up

1291
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:43,920
for the rest of the season, in spite of the fact that they clearly still have feelings

1292
01:32:43,920 --> 01:33:04,880
for one another, and in spite of the efforts of Kory and Topanga to get them back together.

1293
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:09,680
The relationship between Sean and Angela is in direct contrast to Kory and Topanga.

1294
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:20,040
Even Sean himself notices that.

1295
01:33:20,040 --> 01:33:24,000
Kory and Topanga are nice enough to point out that their romance is abnormal, but it's

1296
01:33:24,000 --> 01:33:26,280
clearly affected how Sean views relationships.

1297
01:33:26,280 --> 01:33:30,480
In a way, this puts the audience in Sean's shoes, seeing this ideal couple in Kory and

1298
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:34,260
Topanga and wanting to live that themselves, but coming up short.

1299
01:33:34,260 --> 01:33:38,620
It isn't until season seven that Sean and Angela reconcile, bonding over having both

1300
01:33:38,620 --> 01:33:42,020
been abandoned by their parents, and the fear of growing up to be just like them, running

1301
01:33:42,020 --> 01:33:58,180
out on someone.

1302
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:02,240
The relationship offers a nice lesson that it would only succeed if Angela and Sean were

1303
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:06,100
able to relate to one another directly, and not trying to live up to the expectations

1304
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:08,000
or example of their friends.

1305
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:13,080
The relationship is also notable for being a very rare interracial pairing on 90s television.

1306
01:34:13,080 --> 01:34:17,500
Although the topic is never addressed in the show directly, and Angela's race is rarely

1307
01:34:17,500 --> 01:34:20,720
mentioned at all, it was a deliberate choice by the show's creators.

1308
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:24,460
During an interview, Ryder Strong described the casting for Angela as exclusively looking

1309
01:34:24,460 --> 01:34:26,860
for Black or Latina actresses.

1310
01:34:26,860 --> 01:34:30,460
The pairing was meant to be the colorblind ideal where the race of the two characters

1311
01:34:30,460 --> 01:34:32,260
was entirely arbitrary.

1312
01:34:32,260 --> 01:34:36,140
This was something that Trina McGee appreciated, so much so that she wrote an op-ed in the

1313
01:34:36,140 --> 01:34:40,620
Los Angeles Times describing how she thought the relationship provided a positive example.

1314
01:34:40,620 --> 01:34:42,220
Here is an excerpt from that op-ed.

1315
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:46,420
I get lots of positive reactions from both Black and white teenagers wanting to know

1316
01:34:46,420 --> 01:34:48,680
when Sean and I are getting back together.

1317
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,740
The Black kids are not asking, why are you with that white boy?

1318
01:34:51,740 --> 01:34:56,620
When I intended the NAACP Image Awards, a Black girl lamented to me that Sean and Angela

1319
01:34:56,620 --> 01:34:58,840
are a perfect couple and should be back together.

1320
01:34:58,840 --> 01:35:03,080
The next day, a white girl in a mall begged to know if Sean and Angela are still in love.

1321
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:05,280
One was nine, one pre-teen.

1322
01:35:05,280 --> 01:35:07,480
They are the new face of tolerance.

1323
01:35:07,480 --> 01:35:11,160
These kids are not looking at race, they're absorbing the love story.

1324
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:14,800
To this day, Trina McGee still talks fondly about her experience on the show and how she

1325
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:17,120
didn't really face many negative responses.

1326
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,560
I think it's important to acknowledge that her op-ed was in response to outcry over a

1327
01:35:20,560 --> 01:35:25,520
scene in the series Allie McBeal where Callista Flockhart and Jesse L. Martin exchange a kiss

1328
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:28,200
and that the series never broaches the topic of race.

1329
01:35:28,200 --> 01:35:31,000
A criticism never directed at Boy Meets World.

1330
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,680
Part of that might be because the profile of Allie McBeal was higher, but it also may

1331
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:38,200
be that Boy Meets World's younger audience wasn't expected to deal with a topic such

1332
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:42,320
as race, and the fact that they weren't bothered by Angela and Sean, at least in Trina

1333
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:46,680
McGee's experience, speaks to the fact of how racism is a learned behavior, that kids

1334
01:35:46,680 --> 01:35:50,000
aren't really born with this prejudice in their mind, but learn it through the examples

1335
01:35:50,000 --> 01:35:51,000
around them.

1336
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:55,040
And from that perspective, Angela and Sean offer a positive example of an interracial

1337
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:56,360
relationship.

1338
01:35:56,360 --> 01:36:01,000
But does that represent reality, a reality that a younger audience needs to learn about?

1339
01:36:01,000 --> 01:36:04,540
Those are big questions I'm not sure this video can really tackle, aside from acknowledging

1340
01:36:04,540 --> 01:36:08,480
that interracial relationships have faced a lot of social pressure and continue to do

1341
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:09,480
so today.

1342
01:36:09,480 --> 01:36:13,840
I don't think a show is weaker for not reflecting reality though, it's just taking a different

1343
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,480
approach to tackle the same problem.

1344
01:36:15,480 --> 01:36:19,400
I can't cover every single topic that comes up in one of these shows, so thankfully I

1345
01:36:19,400 --> 01:36:21,000
have a little help this time.

1346
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:23,240
Hey, T1J here.

1347
01:36:23,240 --> 01:36:29,000
Just like Jose, I'm a huge fan of sitcoms, and I have a lot of nostalgic fondness for

1348
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,680
Boy Meets World in particular.

1349
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:37,240
So I actually also made a video about the show, except my video is focused around the

1350
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:43,400
roller coaster relationship between Sean and Angela, which is maybe my favorite sitcom

1351
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:49,160
couple story of all time, for various reasons, which you'll have to watch my video to learn.

1352
01:36:49,160 --> 01:36:51,760
Come check it out when you're done with Jose's video.

1353
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:56,080
Sadly for Sean and Angela, the reunion only lasted until the end of season 7, as a few

1354
01:36:56,080 --> 01:37:00,960
episodes before the finale, we see Angela leave for Europe to spend some time reconnecting

1355
01:37:00,960 --> 01:37:13,520
with her father.

1356
01:37:13,520 --> 01:37:18,080
The episode also revealed another departure might be happening soon, with Tepanga getting

1357
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:29,720
an offer from NYU.

1358
01:37:29,720 --> 01:37:33,840
And that brings us to the two-part series finale, Brave New World.

1359
01:37:33,840 --> 01:37:37,440
There isn't too much in the way of plot, as these episodes offer more a chance for

1360
01:37:37,440 --> 01:37:41,640
the characters to reflect on how their lives have brought them to this point, complete

1361
01:37:41,640 --> 01:37:44,760
with a number of clips from throughout the show's seven seasons.

1362
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:48,700
Tepanga briefly considers not going to New York, but instead is convinced to go after

1363
01:37:48,700 --> 01:38:08,680
some words of wisdom from Mr. Feeney and some encouragement from Corey.

1364
01:38:08,680 --> 01:38:19,800
Eric decides to go along with Corey and Tepanga to New York City.

1365
01:38:19,800 --> 01:38:24,160
Sean and Corey are in the midst of saying goodbye, when Tepanga reveals, Sean is apparently

1366
01:38:24,160 --> 01:38:43,680
going with them too.

1367
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:47,480
Jack and Rachel decide to go in the Peace Corps together, with Jack giving up his stepfather's

1368
01:38:47,480 --> 01:38:59,240
money.

1369
01:38:59,240 --> 01:39:03,320
And Corey has a moment with his new brother Joshua, who seems to have aged pretty quickly

1370
01:39:03,320 --> 01:39:29,560
in the last season.

1371
01:39:29,560 --> 01:39:31,840
And everyone says goodbye.

1372
01:39:59,560 --> 01:40:14,160
And the final line of the series is…

1373
01:40:14,160 --> 01:40:17,940
The series ends hitting the themes that ran through it, that those formative years are

1374
01:40:17,940 --> 01:40:22,320
called that for a reason, and those early relationships you forge can sit with you for

1375
01:40:22,320 --> 01:40:24,320
a lifetime.

1376
01:40:24,320 --> 01:40:28,280
Childhood isn't something to be frivolously forgotten as you age, but something to be

1377
01:40:28,280 --> 01:40:30,480
cherished and remembered as you grow older.

1378
01:40:30,480 --> 01:40:34,840
It's when the world begins to imprint itself on you, shaping your beliefs and relationships

1379
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:36,640
for the rest of your life.

1380
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:40,420
In an interview Michael Jacobs described it, what I think launched a sustained run for

1381
01:40:40,420 --> 01:40:45,760
Boy was an incredible evolution of what you knew, thought you know, to what you never

1382
01:40:45,760 --> 01:40:47,200
really knew at all.

1383
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:50,920
And this final episode highlights that journey, from the world of the first season where the

1384
01:40:50,920 --> 01:40:55,080
lessons and stories are simple, to the more turbulent high school seasons where the world

1385
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:59,000
of the characters is turned upside down, and then finally in the college years, it's

1386
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:02,880
a whole new space where you realize how much more of the world there is to know.

1387
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:07,360
The overarching story does reveal that this sitcom is coming from a very specific perspective,

1388
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:09,920
one of the comfortable life of an upper middle class family.

1389
01:41:09,920 --> 01:41:13,760
Corey's life is challenging, but it doesn't feature hardships that outskied the scope

1390
01:41:13,760 --> 01:41:15,960
of a typical journey to adolescence.

1391
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:19,680
That might be why the series doesn't feel dated, since the only troubles it tackles

1392
01:41:19,680 --> 01:41:24,480
are the ones kids have been facing for a long time and will continue to face into the future.

1393
01:41:24,480 --> 01:41:28,960
This show is ultimately about finding a place in the world, changing it where you can, but

1394
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:31,560
still trusting that it is a place for you.

1395
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:34,620
But the story of the Matthews family wasn't over here.

1396
01:41:34,620 --> 01:41:39,120
We get a glimpse of Corey and Topanga in New York, 14 years later, in a Boy Meets World

1397
01:41:39,120 --> 01:41:43,320
spinoff.

1398
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:46,760
After Boy Meets World went off the air, it moved into syndication, and while most shows

1399
01:41:46,760 --> 01:41:50,400
have a few years there before fading away, something strange happened.

1400
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,300
Boy Meets World did very well on the Disney Channel.

1401
01:41:53,300 --> 01:41:57,000
So well that the show's profile actually went up, with its old audience returning to

1402
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,040
it and a new audience discovering it for the first time.

1403
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:04,480
The growing popularity led to the possibility of a reboot, and after much urging from Disney,

1404
01:42:04,480 --> 01:42:09,240
Michael Jacobs would return to these characters in 2014 with Girl Meets World.

1405
01:42:09,240 --> 01:42:13,680
Starring Rowan Blanchard as Riley Matthews, Corey and Topanga's daughter, and Sabrina

1406
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:17,840
Carpenter, her best friend Maya Hart, the series is set in New York City and tells the

1407
01:42:17,840 --> 01:42:19,640
story of a girl meeting the world.

1408
01:42:19,640 --> 01:42:23,360
Only the Mr. Feeny role this time is played by Corey Matthews.

1409
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:27,080
In addition to telling the stories of Riley and Maya, and their group of friends, the

1410
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:31,440
series also featured a number of cameos of Boy Meets World favorites, tying up several

1411
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:34,120
loose ends and offering a few moments of closure.

1412
01:42:34,120 --> 01:42:37,380
Although the series stands well enough on its own, it's definitely enhanced by having

1413
01:42:37,380 --> 01:42:39,000
watched Boy Meets World.

1414
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:43,120
Episode 16 in the first season, Girl Meets Home for the Holidays, is a particularly great

1415
01:42:43,120 --> 01:42:52,280
episode as it features the return of Sean Hunter.

1416
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:56,360
What makes this episode work so well is how it builds on the original series, with Wayward

1417
01:42:56,360 --> 01:43:00,600
Sean constantly looking for a home and integrates him into the story of Maya who's struggling

1418
01:43:00,600 --> 01:43:04,760
to find a place for herself, and it speaks to the show's theme of how people change

1419
01:43:04,760 --> 01:43:09,520
people, how Corey changed Sean, Riley changed Maya, and how Sean and Maya can change one

1420
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:10,520
another.

1421
01:43:10,520 --> 01:43:15,000
It ran for three seasons on the Disney Channel, totaling 72 episodes, before being canceled

1422
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:16,360
in 2017.

1423
01:43:16,360 --> 01:43:21,000
The cancellation of the series was a bit surprising as its ratings had only slightly dipped over

1424
01:43:21,000 --> 01:43:25,040
three seasons, and Michael Jacobs had fought to keep the show on the air, whether at Disney

1425
01:43:25,040 --> 01:43:26,420
or somewhere else.

1426
01:43:26,420 --> 01:43:30,720
But it had a solid send-off, and while it might not have been as consistent as Boy Meets

1427
01:43:30,720 --> 01:43:37,640
World, Girl Meets World's highest points might have been a few notches higher.

1428
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:41,040
After finishing Boy Meets World, Ben Savage would go to Stanford, where he majored in

1429
01:43:41,040 --> 01:43:42,360
political science.

1430
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:45,840
After completing his education, he returned to the world of entertainment, acting and

1431
01:43:45,840 --> 01:43:47,760
directing, and a number of different projects.

1432
01:43:47,760 --> 01:43:51,880
He's also been cast to play younger versions of Mandy Patinkin on two different shows,

1433
01:43:51,880 --> 01:43:54,040
which I think is a fun fact.

1434
01:43:54,040 --> 01:43:58,120
Ryder Strong also took some time off from acting after Boy Meets World to attend Columbia

1435
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:01,920
University, though he did take a semester off to appear on the movie Cabin Fever.

1436
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:06,920
More recently, he's done less acting as he's instead chosen to focus on writing and directing.

1437
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:11,400
Daniel Fischl went on to appear in a number of movies and worked as a TV presenter following

1438
01:44:11,400 --> 01:44:12,680
the end of Boy Meets World.

1439
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:17,280
Eventually, she decided to go back to school attending California State University Fullerton,

1440
01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:19,160
attaining a degree in psychology.

1441
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,800
More recently, she has been working as a director.

1442
01:44:21,800 --> 01:44:25,680
Will Friedle landed another major role while working on Boy Meets World, becoming the voice

1443
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:28,920
of Terry McGinnis in the animated series Batman Beyond.

1444
01:44:28,920 --> 01:44:33,520
In a strange coincidence, that series finished its last recording on the same day that Boy

1445
01:44:33,520 --> 01:44:35,360
Meets World wrapped filming.

1446
01:44:35,360 --> 01:44:39,440
Since then though, Friedle has become a prolific voice actor, appearing in numerous series

1447
01:44:39,440 --> 01:44:43,200
from Kim Possible to a slew of other TV shows and video games.

1448
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:46,560
In his personal life, he's also learned to manage anxiety issues that affected him

1449
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:50,560
during and after the end of Boy Meets World, and happily he now seems to be in a much better

1450
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,080
place in his life.

1451
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:55,960
Betsy Randall took some time off from acting a few years after the end of Boy Meets World,

1452
01:44:55,960 --> 01:44:59,520
but she has been working continuously since returning in 2014.

1453
01:44:59,520 --> 01:45:03,400
She's most recently appeared in the movie Painter, and in 2013, she celebrated the

1454
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,360
birth of her first grandchild.

1455
01:45:05,360 --> 01:45:08,840
William Russ has been acting consistently since the end of Boy Meets World, appearing

1456
01:45:08,840 --> 01:45:10,920
in countless TV shows and movies.

1457
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:13,680
Most notably he appeared in Deadwood as Otis Russell.

1458
01:45:13,680 --> 01:45:17,400
He also has the unique distinction of being the only actor to direct episodes of Boy Meets

1459
01:45:17,400 --> 01:45:19,480
World and Girl Meets World.

1460
01:45:19,480 --> 01:45:22,880
Trina McGee continued to act following the end of Boy Meets World, appearing in movies

1461
01:45:22,880 --> 01:45:28,640
and television, including movies Friday after Next, and the excellently titled movie Da

1462
01:45:28,640 --> 01:45:30,240
Booty Shop.

1463
01:45:30,240 --> 01:45:33,400
Just recently she wrote and directed the film Detainment.

1464
01:45:33,400 --> 01:45:37,160
Matthew Lawrence continued to act in movies and television after finishing up on Boy Meets

1465
01:45:37,160 --> 01:45:38,160
World.

1466
01:45:38,160 --> 01:45:41,560
He's done less acting over the years, but he has continued singing on occasion, having

1467
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,320
been a singer since his childhood.

1468
01:45:43,320 --> 01:45:48,720
He recently performed in the 2021 movie Mistletoe Mix-Up, singing alongside his brothers Joey

1469
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,320
and Andrew.

1470
01:45:50,320 --> 01:45:54,080
After Boy Meets World, Maitland Ward continued to act for a few years, notably appearing

1471
01:45:54,080 --> 01:45:55,760
in the movie White Chicks.

1472
01:45:55,760 --> 01:46:00,200
Over the years she has moved away from the mainstream acting world and in 2019, she began

1473
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:01,680
working in adult films.

1474
01:46:01,680 --> 01:46:06,360
She seems to be quite happy in her new field and is enjoying exploring this new career

1475
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:07,480
path.

1476
01:46:07,480 --> 01:46:11,600
Even after such a long and prolific career, William Daniels continued to act in a number

1477
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:15,800
of roles following the end of Boy Meets World, including a recent reprisal as the card Kit

1478
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:19,840
from Knight Rider in the 2020 movie Super Intelligence.

1479
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:23,480
Daniels has become more selective with his projects in recent years, and at 95 years

1480
01:46:23,480 --> 01:46:26,560
of age, he's mostly taking life easy these days.

1481
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:31,600
He is still married to his wife of 70 years, Bonnie Bartlett, and they are still adorable

1482
01:46:31,600 --> 01:46:32,800
together.

1483
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:36,680
While researching this video, I watched over a dozen different panels at band conventions

1484
01:46:36,680 --> 01:46:40,520
where the cast shared memories of working on the series, and what was particularly surprising

1485
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,800
was how many of these panels were in the last five years.

1486
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:46,680
And while there were always Girl Meets World fans who found the show later in life, there

1487
01:46:46,680 --> 01:46:50,160
are also a number of older fans who fondly remember it from their childhood, talking

1488
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:53,800
about how comforting it was to watch these characters, who remind them of the more carefree

1489
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:55,400
days of the 90s.

1490
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:58,280
These are the childhood memories of when everything was going to turn out alright if

1491
01:46:58,280 --> 01:47:02,640
we just followed the rules, and we did, yet here we are.

1492
01:47:02,640 --> 01:47:04,240
Things aren't alright at all.

1493
01:47:04,240 --> 01:47:08,720
The world and television in general has become a more cynical place in the 22 years since

1494
01:47:08,720 --> 01:47:12,120
the last episode of Boy Meets World aired, and I don't think there's any shame in

1495
01:47:12,120 --> 01:47:16,040
watching a few episodes of a TV series that carried some optimism and hope about how in

1496
01:47:16,040 --> 01:47:19,160
this big scary world, there was still a place for you.

1497
01:47:19,160 --> 01:47:22,560
It's comfort without being completely overwhelmed by fantasy.

1498
01:47:22,560 --> 01:47:26,480
Boy Meets World isn't blind to the suffering of the world, and goes out of its way to explore

1499
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:31,240
these topics, but it can never escape the family-friendly TGIF dynamic it was born into,

1500
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:34,480
and while that doesn't make it a bad show, I think it's important to acknowledge its

1501
01:47:34,480 --> 01:47:35,880
perspective.

1502
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:40,080
That comfort, with a dose of reality, might be the key to its longevity.

1503
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:45,000
It saw the world, at least part of it, as something flawed, yet held out some hope that

1504
01:47:45,000 --> 01:47:48,600
it could be made better, which is why the series ended with a final lesson from Mr.

1505
01:47:48,600 --> 01:47:52,840
Feeney to dream, try, and do good.

1506
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:57,600
With the safe lesson of Boy Meets World over, offering a hint of the trials ahead of us,

1507
01:47:57,600 --> 01:48:02,200
the lesson is not to wish for the fantasies it presented, or cynically sneer at its limited

1508
01:48:02,200 --> 01:48:07,400
scope, but to instead take to heart the idea that we make the most of the only world we've

1509
01:48:07,400 --> 01:48:12,320
got, and hopefully the next generation will be making a better one.

1510
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:15,720
When I first started doing these retrospectives, Boy Meets World was one of the first shows

1511
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:17,000
I saw requested.

1512
01:48:17,000 --> 01:48:19,480
I remember thinking to myself, probably not likely.

1513
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:23,440
I was never a huge fan, I don't know if I necessarily want to revisit that one, but

1514
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:28,660
over time the requests kept coming, and eventually I was worn down, and I was happily surprised.

1515
01:48:28,660 --> 01:48:32,280
It held up pretty well, and while it doesn't resonate as strongly as it probably does for

1516
01:48:32,280 --> 01:48:36,360
the more die-hard Boy Meets World fans out there who might be watching this, I hope you

1517
01:48:36,360 --> 01:48:42,080
still enjoyed this trip down memory line, and this revisiting of a beloved series.

1518
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:46,880
This video would not have been possible without the lovely names you see floating up the screen

1519
01:48:46,880 --> 01:48:47,880
