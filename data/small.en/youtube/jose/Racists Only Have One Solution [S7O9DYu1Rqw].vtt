WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.280
This is the sort of video I make when I'm trapped inside all day.

00:09.440 --> 00:13.680
As I speak, we're in the midst of a global pandemic where everyone is trying to quarantine

00:13.680 --> 00:18.000
themselves away from the infectious world around them. While I'm not going to present myself as

00:18.000 --> 00:22.560
someone nearly knowledgeable enough to speak as an authority on how society should be handling

00:22.560 --> 00:27.440
this moment, I want to talk about how some even less qualified people are using it to

00:27.440 --> 00:32.240
spread their fascist propaganda. Reactionaries of many stripes have been growing quite a bit

00:32.240 --> 00:37.520
about borders lately, particularly since various nations are self-quarantining in the face of a

00:37.520 --> 00:43.360
global pandemic. This somehow vindicates their long calls for closing borders. Of course,

00:43.360 --> 00:48.720
closing borders during a pandemic isn't the same as stopping mass migration, which is what they're

00:48.720 --> 00:52.960
always complaining about, but that's not stopping them from offering the only solution they ever

00:52.960 --> 00:58.880
have in a crisis. Paul Joseph Watson gives us an example in his video, Idiots React to Coronavirus.

00:58.880 --> 01:03.920
I think there's a typo in it that S should probably be behind reacts. Anyway, here's the clip.

01:03.920 --> 01:09.440
The irony of singing a song about open borders after a disease has killed thousands of people

01:10.400 --> 01:18.320
because of open borders. And in C-O-R-O-N-A-V-I-R-U-S sick face emoji, he has a similar take.

01:18.320 --> 01:26.720
Russia, which closed its entire 2600 mile border back in January. Just 20 coronavirus cases,

01:26.720 --> 01:32.320
most of which were Russians returning from Italy. Most of the victims have already recovered,

01:32.320 --> 01:38.960
zero deaths. No pandemic in Russia. Strong border controls, minimal coronavirus cases.

01:38.960 --> 01:43.120
What's most obnoxious about these clips is the smugness dripping out of Watson.

01:43.680 --> 01:49.040
But why does he feel like he can be so smug? Since when has Paul ever spoken about the spread of a

01:49.040 --> 01:54.720
pandemic? We get a better understanding of the smugness from the even more smug Stefan Molyneux

01:54.720 --> 01:59.200
in his video, Coronavirus Update with Stefan Molyneux borders closed.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.600
Guess the world leaders have given up on the mainstream media and now they're listening to

02:07.600 --> 02:16.400
alternative media. And that may be the salvation of hundreds of thousands of people. And that is

02:16.400 --> 02:25.040
a very, very powerful thing. And I'm pleased and I'm proud to have done my part in helping to save

02:25.040 --> 02:28.720
thousands of lives, hundreds of thousands of lives, potentially millions around the world,

02:28.720 --> 02:33.600
not a bad couple of weeks work. People in Canada, people in the West have been desperate to close

02:33.600 --> 02:42.320
their borders for 20 years, more really 30 years or so. And it's here we understand what the project

02:42.320 --> 02:46.800
really looks like. The pandemic is being used to foment the same anti-immigrant sentiment these

02:46.800 --> 02:50.640
folks have always been using. They want us to pair the feeling of safety you might get with

02:50.640 --> 02:55.440
temporary border closures with closing borders to immigration. Here's some telling anecdotes

02:55.440 --> 03:01.920
Paul Joseph Watson uses in his social distancing hand emoji video. Mark D. Levine, chair of New

03:01.920 --> 03:07.680
York City Council Health Committee, lauded how huge crowds gathering in New York City's Chinatown

03:07.680 --> 03:14.080
was a powerful show of defiance of the coronavirus scare, tweeting four images of large groups of

03:14.080 --> 03:18.960
people gathered to celebrate the occasion. Most of the attendees were Chinese and some of them

03:18.960 --> 03:24.560
had almost certainly recently returned from China. And he conflates the movement of people with social

03:24.560 --> 03:30.480
distancing. According to top Italian virologist Dr. Giorgio Palau, Italy's left-wing government

03:30.480 --> 03:37.360
refused to isolate people coming in from China because it was seen as quote racist. That's not

03:37.360 --> 03:42.640
social distancing. Of course it's important to note that immigration is not the same thing as

03:42.640 --> 03:47.760
social distancing. Social distancing refers to the distance we keep between individual people

03:47.760 --> 03:53.760
on a daily basis. Whether or not that person is an immigrant is irrelevant because it turns out

03:53.760 --> 04:00.400
the virus doesn't actually care what your ethnicity is. Paul Joseph Watson does not want you to notice

04:00.400 --> 04:05.760
the misdirection he's using here. He wants you to think of immigrants specifically and especially

04:05.760 --> 04:10.400
being carriers of the virus. One thing I'd like to entangle here is that when a nation state closes

04:10.400 --> 04:14.960
its borders that this is an effective way of stopping a pandemic. Even if you're someone who

04:14.960 --> 04:19.200
generally likes immigration you may still be under that impression that keeping infected people out

04:19.200 --> 04:24.080
of your country during a global pandemic is a good thing. For instance, Watson and Molyneux both talk

04:24.080 --> 04:29.040
about how it's been so effective for Russia so we should be taking their lead on this. The truth is

04:29.040 --> 04:33.280
it's a bit more complicated than that. According to the World Health Organization, closing

04:33.280 --> 04:38.000
international borders in the midst of a global pandemic has a limited impact and can possibly

04:38.000 --> 04:42.560
do more harm to a nation by limiting trade, particularly for nations that rely on exporting

04:42.560 --> 04:47.760
their goods to keep their economy afloat. Various mathematical models suggest that isolation only

04:47.760 --> 04:52.560
delays the inevitable spread of a disease and that other strategies like self-quarantining and

04:52.560 --> 04:57.840
stronger health care services are more effective. And we can look at the Russia example right now.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.200
Watson and Molyneux were talking about how closing down the borders was going to save

05:01.200 --> 05:06.240
Russia from this incoming pandemic, but it turns out the mathematical models used by the World

05:06.240 --> 05:11.440
Health Organization were much better predictors. And we can see sadly that COVID has started to

05:11.440 --> 05:16.880
rise very rapidly within Russia. Turns out viruses don't necessarily stop at borders.

05:17.680 --> 05:23.360
So why do nation states close their borders? In an article for Foreign Policy, Dr. Mara

05:23.440 --> 05:28.160
Pillinger suggests the reason they do this isn't because they're effective on their face,

05:28.160 --> 05:32.160
but rather they signal to the population that the government is taking extreme measures to

05:32.160 --> 05:35.840
control the situation. And it's understandable that in a time like this, people want to think

05:35.840 --> 05:40.000
that their government has things under control. But there are more important steps that need to

05:40.000 --> 05:45.200
be taken, like providing health care for citizens, coordinating with scientists around the world to

05:45.200 --> 05:49.760
work on treatments. There are of course benefits to restricting travel, especially when it comes

05:49.840 --> 05:54.960
to social distancing and the dangers of having people crowded into buses or airplanes. And the

05:54.960 --> 05:59.360
role borders play when it comes to the spread of a disease during a pandemic is an interesting and

05:59.360 --> 06:04.320
important discussion. But that's not what we're talking about in these videos. We're not getting

06:04.320 --> 06:09.120
a fact-based argument about border control from these guys. What we're seeing is the scapegoating

06:09.120 --> 06:15.760
of immigrants and non-white populations. Immigrants are not responsible for the spread of COVID-19.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.120
This shouldn't need to be said, but considering the people we're talking about here, it shouldn't

06:19.120 --> 06:23.360
be surprising that immigrants are once again presented as a scapegoat. Let me go back to this

06:23.360 --> 06:27.680
clip for a second. Most of the attendees were Chinese and some of them had almost certainly

06:27.680 --> 06:34.000
recently returned from China. What is Paul Joseph Watson talking about here? How does he know anyone

06:34.000 --> 06:38.080
in this crowd was recently in China? And if they were in China, how does he know what they were

06:38.080 --> 06:43.680
exposed to? Why is he just assuming that anyone Chinese is a potential virus sector? These people

06:43.680 --> 06:48.080
could very well have been born in the US, or they could have been living there for years.

06:48.080 --> 06:52.480
Maybe none of them have been back to China for decades. I don't know, and the important thing

06:52.480 --> 06:58.720
is neither does he. To assume that Chinese people are inherently more dangerous is, well, it's a

06:58.720 --> 07:05.440
racist assumption. And for God's sake, can we focus on what matters while fighting a deadly global

07:05.440 --> 07:12.240
pandemic? Can we just shut up about racism for five fucking minutes? Maybe he could help us out

07:12.240 --> 07:16.480
by being less racist. If he were criticizing the actions of the Chinese government, that would be

07:16.480 --> 07:21.280
fine. There's plenty of criticism to be done on that side, but he would sooner put it on the

07:21.280 --> 07:26.480
Chinese people themselves, portraying everyone who's Chinese or of Chinese descent as a potential

07:26.480 --> 07:31.440
threat. Paul Joseph Watson and Stefan Molyneux are part of a project to demonize people of color.

07:31.440 --> 07:35.600
For all the talk you might have heard of Asian immigrants being preferable to immigrants from

07:35.600 --> 07:40.240
Africa or the Middle East, the second they think they have a plausible excuse, this minority group

07:40.240 --> 07:45.360
is going under the bus just as quickly. This pandemic will be used to justify portraying people

07:45.360 --> 07:50.160
of Asian descent as dangerous and disease-ridden, all in an effort to create what every fascist

07:50.160 --> 07:56.000
wants, an ethnostate. And we can see some of this anti-Chinese and more broadly anti-East Asian

07:56.000 --> 08:01.520
sentiment manifesting itself right now. The FBI has warned of a possible surge in hate crimes in

08:01.520 --> 08:06.240
the US, and in Canada there have been increased reports of Canadians of Southeast Asian descent

08:06.240 --> 08:11.120
facing discrimination. Here are some words from Cynthia Choi, the co-executive director of Chinese

08:11.120 --> 08:16.480
for affirmative action. We are very, very concerned in the Asian-American community that

08:16.480 --> 08:24.560
this will have a lasting impact. We have yet to understand the full extent of what it will mean

08:24.560 --> 08:31.200
to come out on the other side. We don't think that the anti-Asian sentiment that we're seeing now is

08:31.200 --> 08:37.120
going to go away, and we're going to need to address that as a society. And make no mistake,

08:37.120 --> 08:41.840
using terms like Chinese virus and the fixation of Chinese people as a threat

08:41.840 --> 08:46.640
is part of a long-term game. We've been hearing echoes of this from the exact same commentators

08:46.640 --> 08:51.440
for years. Here's another Paul Joseph Watson clip. This is from December of 2019 titled

08:51.440 --> 08:57.360
Diversity is our strength. Now I haven't quite been able to put my finger on it, but could there

08:57.360 --> 09:03.440
be some kind of connection between the relative safety of these countries and the kind of people

09:03.440 --> 09:09.120
who live there? But who needs safety when you can have diversity? I know which one I choose.

09:09.840 --> 09:14.400
Who needs actual borders when you can just have internal diversity barriers?

09:14.400 --> 09:18.800
It's a simple video with a simple message. There need to be fewer people of color in Europe and

09:18.800 --> 09:24.080
North America. Previously this was largely about Muslim immigrants and refugees capitalizing on

09:24.080 --> 09:28.960
increase in anti-Muslim sentiment after September 11th, and I think this makes clear what the

09:28.960 --> 09:33.600
fascist playbook looks like, because they really only have one go-to move, and that's scapegoating

09:33.600 --> 09:37.840
minority groups. One thing you'll note from extremists like Watson and Molyneux is that

09:37.840 --> 09:41.920
they're quite ready to criticize politicians on the left, but are far more reluctant to call up

09:41.920 --> 09:47.440
politicians on the right. For example when Watson says, now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this

09:47.440 --> 09:54.000
isn't a big deal, and the people who say it's just the flu are obviously downplaying the severity of

09:54.960 --> 09:59.600
You'd think it would be followed by a clip like this. This is a flu. This is like a flu.

10:00.320 --> 10:04.240
Well if you're familiar with Paul Joseph Watson you probably wouldn't expect him to do something

10:04.240 --> 10:08.880
like that. Instead he would rather lambast politicians on the left. The reason for this

10:08.880 --> 10:13.760
is because these far-right figures are more likely to find support in mainstream conservatism. Here

10:13.760 --> 10:19.920
are some examples of Tucker Carlson talking about the dangers of immigration and open borders.

10:19.920 --> 10:24.880
Get rid of ICE, accept most refugees, give citizenship to tens of millions of people

10:24.880 --> 10:30.480
here illegally. In other words, open borders. The idea of closing borders is already popular on

10:30.480 --> 10:34.960
the right, although in that case it's using immigrants as scapegoats for economic hardship.

10:34.960 --> 10:39.600
The far-right piggybacks on this exact same strategy, using immigrants as scapegoats for,

10:39.600 --> 10:43.680
well, pretty much everything. Watson and Molyneux are clearly afraid of angering the right-wing

10:43.680 --> 10:48.480
audience, but they're still playing them. They're exploiting this crisis, comforting their audience

10:48.480 --> 10:52.720
to assure them that their beloved right-wing politicians have no responsibility for their

10:52.720 --> 10:58.080
government's poor response, when really politicians of all stripes have failed to one degree or another.

10:58.080 --> 11:02.240
The mission of these two is to target politicians who would be greater obstacles for their far-right

11:02.240 --> 11:06.640
agenda. We can see this in some of the rhetoric used by the likes of Watson. Here's an example of

11:06.640 --> 11:11.760
how he ties immigration directly to the pandemic and tries to imply his stance is a more authentic

11:11.760 --> 11:17.520
vision of conservatism. They all the big city LA and New York conservatives who are panicking

11:17.600 --> 11:21.920
because their favorite lobster restaurants are closing and they can't cook. These are the same

11:21.920 --> 11:27.200
conservatives who quietly support mass immigration because they need cheap foreign labor ethnic

11:27.200 --> 11:32.720
minorities to prepare all their food. We see this approach to other problems as well. To a fascist,

11:32.720 --> 11:37.680
there's no crisis in the world that is insolvable by demonizing ethnic minorities. We can see that

11:37.680 --> 11:42.320
with the slow rise of eco-fascism, where elements of the far right are adopting the rhetoric of

11:42.320 --> 11:48.000
environmentalists to spread their fascism. Naomi Klein spoke about this back in September of 2019.

11:48.000 --> 11:55.360
I think the only thing scarier than a far-right racist movement that denies the reality of climate

11:55.360 --> 11:59.840
change is a far-right racist movement that doesn't deny the reality of climate change.

11:59.840 --> 12:04.160
That actually says this is happening. There are going to be many, many millions of people on the

12:04.160 --> 12:12.960
move. And we are going to use this abhorrent ideology that ranks the relative value of human

12:12.960 --> 12:18.720
life, that puts white Christians at the top of the hierarchy, that animalizes and otherizes everyone

12:18.720 --> 12:26.800
else, as the justification for allowing those people to die. The same global response we need

12:26.800 --> 12:31.680
to combat climate change is the same one we need to respond to the pandemic. And some of the rhetoric

12:31.680 --> 12:36.480
used about this pandemic is already proving to be quite dangerous and ready for exploitation by

12:36.480 --> 12:42.880
fascists, such as comments claiming that humanity is the virus. Now call me a radical if you must,

12:42.880 --> 12:50.320
but I am pro-human. That's right, pro-human. And maybe this is just the dreamer in me, but I think

12:50.320 --> 12:55.360
humans can live on this planet in a way that doesn't destroy it. What's worse about this rhetoric is

12:55.360 --> 13:00.720
that it's not very difficult for a fascist to swoop in and say, yes, humans are the problem, but let's

13:00.720 --> 13:06.640
just rephrase that, not all humans surely, just the wrong kinds of humans. The ones you perhaps

13:06.640 --> 13:11.280
don't want to be living next to. If you're one of those people who thinks humanity is the virus,

13:11.280 --> 13:17.680
you might even lean in a little more. Hmm, tell me more. And that's the trap fascists use. So we

13:17.680 --> 13:22.720
need to be very careful in the strategies we use to fight pandemics and all sorts of other struggles.

13:22.720 --> 13:26.480
We can stop a pandemic by working together to limit its spread and ensure that the most

13:27.200 --> 13:30.800
vulnerable have access to care. And we can stop climate change by reducing emissions and helping

13:30.800 --> 13:35.040
those most harmed by its effects. These are problems that require a number of different

13:35.040 --> 13:39.360
approaches and all of us cooperating together. Those of us who would sooner divide us into tribes

13:39.360 --> 13:45.040
to war against one another so they can create their little fiefdoms aren't worth listening to.

13:45.040 --> 13:50.560
Those are the voices dragging us backwards. Much in the way conservatives only have the one joke

13:50.560 --> 13:57.440
about gender they use over and over to attack trans people. Look, here's Ben Shapiro doing a

13:57.440 --> 14:05.120
version of it. Good one, Ben. Fascists only have one solution to real world problems, whether it's

14:05.120 --> 14:10.480
income inequality, climate change, terrorism, or a global pandemic. They always blame immigrants,

14:10.480 --> 14:15.760
they always blame ethnic minorities, and they always find the most vulnerable groups to scapegoat.

14:15.760 --> 14:20.080
Because they actually don't care about solving these problems. Their goal is to create an

14:20.080 --> 14:24.800
ethno state and that starts by getting rid of all the people they consider undesirable.

14:24.800 --> 14:28.560
We face a number of problems today and they require a number of different solutions and

14:28.560 --> 14:32.880
they require us to work together as a global community. We can't stop a pandemic one nation

14:32.880 --> 14:37.840
at a time. The same way we can't stop any of these other real challenges, we face as a species

14:37.840 --> 14:42.880
without working together. Jose, you might be asking, what are these solutions you speak of?

14:43.440 --> 14:49.520
When it comes to pandemics, listen to medical professionals rather than pundits and politicians.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.440
When it comes to your own personal health care. And as for political solutions,

14:53.440 --> 14:58.000
demand better access to health care. When it comes to relief packages, voice your support

14:58.000 --> 15:02.640
for those that help marginalize communities and workers and people uniquely affected by this

15:02.640 --> 15:07.440
pandemic. And more importantly, while we're all inside talking to one another from around the

15:07.440 --> 15:11.680
world, let's try and realize that we're all in this together. That these movements we want to

15:11.680 --> 15:16.320
create are ones that need to be truly global. At the end of the day, we need to be united.

15:16.320 --> 15:23.280
Even if we could create our beautiful utopia here in this little patch of land we call Canada,

15:23.280 --> 15:27.440
it would mean nothing to me if the rest of the world was suffering and miserable.

15:28.320 --> 15:33.440
So this video was a bit of a surprise. I cooked it together pretty quickly. It's something I've

15:33.440 --> 15:37.280
been looking at for the last couple of weeks and I kind of want to just say something quick about it.

15:37.280 --> 15:42.320
I'm trying to make shorter videos because I think the long epics as fun as they are aren't the only

15:42.320 --> 15:46.560
thing people want to see on YouTube. People like this one. I'll might make shorter commentary ones

15:46.560 --> 15:51.280
like this in the future. For those of you wondering, where is the sitcom video you spoke of? Wasn't

15:51.280 --> 15:57.200
that what you've been working on for the last few months? Yes. Yes, it is. And was. It's still

15:57.200 --> 16:04.000
coming. Turns out a complication has arisen. It's gonna take a little bit longer to come out than I

16:04.000 --> 16:10.320
expected. I hope to have it up for everyone to watch soon. When that will be, I just don't know

16:10.320 --> 16:15.440
right now. But if you want to know as soon as it's up, I highly recommend following me on Twitter

16:15.440 --> 16:22.320
where I will have updates. Or you can also become a patron because they'll be seen at first. You'll

16:22.320 --> 16:27.040
also get their names and the credits just like you see here and all those and there's like another

16:27.040 --> 16:32.400
like theme song download thing. Yeah, that's there too. If you join my Patreon, I want to add though,

16:32.400 --> 16:38.080
it's a really difficult time right now for a lot of people. If you are someone who's facing some

16:38.080 --> 16:43.920
economic hardship, I want you to know I completely understand and I encourage you not to become a

16:43.920 --> 16:48.880
patron if you're in that situation. Please take care of yourself. I'm gonna be fine. I would hate

16:48.880 --> 16:55.120
to think someone was giving me any money and then struggling to put food on their table. That's

16:55.120 --> 17:00.320
money I just don't want in my pocket. If you do want to support this channel, there is a thing you

17:00.320 --> 17:04.320
can do for free. It's called hitting that like button, subscribing if you aren't already,

17:04.320 --> 17:10.400
ringing that bell and leaving a lovely comment below. And before I leave, I'll give you one

17:10.400 --> 17:15.840
last thing and that is my thank you for watching. Bye.
