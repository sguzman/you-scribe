1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
the overturning of Roe v. Wade will make abortion dramatically more difficult to obtain in the

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,400
United States, and young conservative commentators are saying things like this.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,040
These feminists are so upset because they can't murder their children,

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,400
they can't offer them out to Molech.

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,920
That's Elijah Shafer. On his show Slightly Offensive, part of the Blaze Media Network,

6
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,880
a right-wing media network founded in part by former Fox News firebrand Glenn Beck.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,920
And that's just the tip of the iceberg on the sort of stuff Shafer says.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,800
People think that Australia is great because it's an all-white country,

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,560
and it's just that's the only reason why it's good.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,680
And I don't, you can say that that's white supremacists, no, it's just it's a homogenous

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,840
group of people with less population than there is in California and a landmass bigger than the

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,160
United States. They get along, they don't commit crime, they're clean, and they have a common,

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,120
they have a common group.

14
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,480
You think in the last days that you would refuse the mark of the beast,

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,640
but you wouldn't even sacrifice being judged by your friends to not get a vaccine?

16
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,520
Craving for baby's blood has never been stronger. And when you look at this woman before us,

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,680
nobody is forcing you to be a whore.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,600
Shafer is a strange breed of conservative commentator. He has the opinions of a

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,240
middle-aged right-wing white evangelical from the 1980s, but the style of an alt-right shit

20
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,680
poster from the mid 2010s. He embodies an inherent hybrid of where right-wing commentary is heading,

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,680
taking elements from previous conservative movements and coalescing them into this new

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,480
style of commentary. To understand Shafer's quick ascent in the conservative commentary space,

23
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:26,720
we have to go back and understand the rise of the religious right in American politics.

24
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,200
Now, we could go back to the likes of Father Coughlin or Norman Vincent Peale,

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,360
but instead let's start at the religious right's rise in the 1970s,

26
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,440
particularly in its fight against abortion and its push for family values.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,320
While it's commonly believed that popular opposition to abortion is what galvanized

28
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,800
religious people to flock to the right, Randall Balmer, the John Phillips professor in religion

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,680
at Dartmouth College, conducted some research that presents a different picture. Paul Weyrich,

30
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,600
a religious conservative political activist and co-founder of the Heritage Foundation,

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,080
was hoping to capitalize on evangelical voters who had been slowly voting more frequently for

32
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:06,880
the Republican Party following the end of World War II. Weyrich believed that if he could organize

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,040
them on a mass scale, they would become a powerful voting bloc. Writing in the mid-1970s, Weyrich said,

34
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,120
the new political philosophy must be defined by us conservatives in moral terms, packaged in

35
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,600
non-religious language and propagated throughout the country by our new coalition. When political

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:29,200
power is achieved, the moral majority will have the opportunity to recreate this great nation.

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,600
Weyrich believed that if he could convince the leadership of evangelical and fundamentalist

38
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,920
Christian leaders to advocate for conservative politicians, their congregations would all

39
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,880
dutifully follow them in lockstep. And he floated a number of issues in their direction to catch the

40
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:48,080
interest of religious folks with little success. Early on, this did include abortion. According to

41
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,120
Balmer's research, evangelical leadership was largely indifferent to abortion. For example,

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,640
evangelical leader Jerry Falwell's first anti-abortion sermon wasn't until 1978,

43
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,920
five years after the 1973 Roe v. Wade verdict made abortion legal in the United States.

44
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,720
There are also examples of various evangelical leaders expressing indifference or even tepid

45
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,520
support of abortion. The rejection of abortion on religious moral grounds is something that actually

46
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,400
came a little bit later. What finally captured the attention of evangelical leadership to become

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,440
more involved in politics, though, was the Green v. Connolly ruling, which affirmed that a private

48
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,760
school which practiced racial discrimination could not be eligible for a tax exemption.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,360
This impacted quite infamously Bob Jones University, which was a whites-only school.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,640
With tax-exempt status at risk, evangelical leadership was very quick to take the side of

51
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:43,840
Bob Jones University, reframing the issue of being a whites-only school as a question of

52
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,560
religious freedom. The school argued that since it didn't take any federal money, aside from not

53
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,800
paying taxes, they shouldn't be expected to follow the same rules as public schools.

54
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,560
This didn't hold up in court. Bob Jones University lost its tax-exempt status and thus lit a fire

55
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,880
under evangelical leadership, and they soon began working with Wayrock and his allies to create an

56
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:10,080
evangelical floating block. Only, racial discrimination wasn't quite popular enough in the 1970s, at least

57
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,040
when it came to advocating that in public, so they started exploring other options. In 1978,

58
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,840
a leaflet campaign in Minnesota by Catholic organizers was credited with getting anti-abortion

59
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,240
candidates both senate seats, as well as the governorship, unlike evangelicals, right when

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,960
Catholics had been fighting against abortion for years. Although abortion as an issue hadn't worked

61
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,440
a few years prior, this success led Wayrock and his allies to rethink the tactic, and they started

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,240
brainstorming how this issue could be sold to evangelicals. As a reminder, Roe v. Wade was

63
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,880
five years old at this point. Anti-abortion sermons started being delivered and propaganda

64
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,000
started being produced, such as the film series Whatever Happened to the Human Race? Here's a

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:05:00,960
clip from that thing. As public sentiment among evangelicals began to change, anti-abortion took

66
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,040
its place among other issues this newly christened, moral majority would champion, including anti-gay

67
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,880
laws, christian prayer in school, among other things that would be labeled as family values.

68
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,560
This block solidified during the 1980s, and in that time the religious right would become a force in

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,360
American politics, often behind some of the most conservative social policies. They were accepted

70
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,600
into the Republican party, and they refused to a number of different conservative policies.

71
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:31,840
The religious right's influence can be heavily felt in the George W. Bush presidency, where

72
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:37,200
professions of faith were common, including very strong overtures to religious right concerns,

73
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:43,680
such as teaching creationism or generally being opposed to same-sex marriage. In the early years

74
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,080
of the Obama presidency, the Tea Party movement was very much an inheritor of this Christian right

75
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:52,240
movement. Though certain parts of the overall package waned over the years, such as prayer

76
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,960
in schools, the fight against abortion remained constant, and affirmation to that cause is one

77
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,160
of many reasons that led evangelicals to support Donald Trump in his bid for the presidency.

78
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,720
And this leads us back to Elijah Schaeffer. He's relatively new to this scene,

79
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,640
but he's an inheritor of this same brand of Christian conservatism. Born in 1993, Schaeffer

80
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:17,680
entered the world of right-wing commentary in the mid-2018s in his mid-20s. His years before that

81
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,680
were a combination of homeschooling and private schools, eventually graduating from a Christian

82
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,480
university in California with a degree in molecular biology. Which is very strange,

83
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,520
considering he doesn't believe in macroevolution. That is, the change in organisms that leads to the

84
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:40,800
development of new species. His critiques against evolution really don't have any substance,

85
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,840
and he gets to this vague, unanswerable question about why man is here, as this should somehow

86
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:50,720
completely overturn all the evidence which he seems to believe he's made a thorough examination

87
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,480
in the face of countless scientists working over the centuries.

88
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,560
You may have noticed in that answer a lack of specificity. This is something you'll be

89
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,120
seeing a lot as we go through Schaeffer's work, rambling that seems to be leading to a point,

90
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,440
but never quite gets there before being derailed by something else. For example,

91
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,720
when responding to his thoughts about evolution, here's where it ends up.

92
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:42,640
I should mention at this point Schaeffer claimed to be sober at the time this supposed possession

93
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:47,040
happened, though it did involve a friend who was on drugs at the time. Schaeffer himself has a

94
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:52,080
history with psychedelics and other drugs that cause hallucinations. While I have no real insight

95
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,320
into what happened to Schaeffer here, and I'm certainly not a doctor, I'm going to be bold and

96
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:01,440
suggest that he may have been experiencing hallucinogenic persisting perception disorder,

97
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,640
a hallucinogenic experience which has been known to happen sometimes years after a person has taken

98
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,440
hallucinogenic drugs. Or there could be a number of other scientific explanations here for what's

99
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:17,360
happening, or of course it is possible his friend was possessed by a literal demon that made its way

100
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
into Schaeffer's body. Feel free to make up your own mind on which of these is the most likely

101
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:26,080
outcome. Schaeffer credits Ben Shapiro with inspiring him to start a right-wing podcast,

102
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:31,040
although he wanted his style to be a bit different. He considered Ben Shapiro to be inoffensive and

103
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:36,240
more far-right provocateurs such as Milo Yiannopoulos to be offensive, and he wanted himself to be

104
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,680
somewhere in the middle, hence the title of his show, Slightly Offensive. The first iteration

105
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,000
of his show seems to have been lost to time. From how he described it in interviews, it was a series

106
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:51,200
of studio-based opinion segments, not unlike his later work. Eventually this was reshaped into the

107
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,240
mid-2018 version that still, at least partially, exists on his YouTube channel, where he would

108
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,040
attend left-wing protests to interview people in an attempt to make them look ignorant. A tried and

109
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,720
true technique practiced by Lawrence Southern, Steven Crowder, and various other right-wing

110
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,120
commentators. Schaeffer's production quality was higher than usual for these street interviews

111
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,600
because of his background working in commercial production. The actual quality of the interviews

112
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,520
left something to be desired though, with Schaeffer often talking over, interrupting,

113
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,920
and editing people to make them look as silly as possible.

114
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:59,920
In a video published on June 29, 2018, Schaeffer interviewed people at a women's

115
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,400
march. One of those people was a woman named Angie, who was kind enough to speak to me about

116
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:29,680
the experience. Angie is

117
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,360
one of several people who were featured in this video, and she describes the

118
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,320
experience of the backlash that followed her appearance there.

119
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:28,160
Angie would run into Schaeffer a few days later at another protest.

120
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,320
I saw them kind of cornering an older lady who, and I could see that she was getting animated

121
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:41,040
talking to him, and so I walked over and I said, you know, don't talk to him. He's gonna, you know,

122
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,040
he's gonna make you a target on the internet, basically. He said, you know, he went into

123
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,920
reasonable mode. He was like, you know, we're just trying to get all perspectives. I'm asking

124
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:53,440
questions. You know, he said, I thought we had a really good conversation the other day.

125
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,800
And I know that I kind of went off, not in an aggressive way, but in a way that was like,

126
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:10,240
I don't understand how you can present yourself like this, and then switch to putting out content

127
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:17,120
that you know is going to generate violent, hateful reactions. He's like, I don't condone

128
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,920
any of that. And he was like, I'll say it to camera right now. And he did a direct to camera,

129
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,720
you know, appeal to people to not make violent threats and all of that. The video was uploaded

130
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,200
unedited to Shafer's YouTube channel, and Angie noticed that her child was visible in the shot

131
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,000
where she had confronted him. Angie DM'd Shafer asking him to take the video down to protect her

132
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,560
child's safety, which he did eventually do, but there was an interesting part of her interaction

133
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,240
with him. He tried to be very complimentary about, you know, how I'd spoken, you know, he said,

134
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:53,680
we didn't edit you, and I usually edit people, and you were well spoken, so we let your words

135
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,600
just stand for themselves. And then he asked if I would be willing to do an interview with him.

136
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,960
He was like, you know, people were really responding to you, you know, trying to

137
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:11,440
stroke my ego or something. To Elijah Shafer, all of these appearances seem more like a game,

138
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,920
an attempt to puff up his political side while trying to find foils on the other side he could

139
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,120
film himself verbally jousting against. Something that's antithetical to actual journalism that

140
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,360
purports itself to be genuinely trying to understand the motivations and opinions of people

141
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,920
attending a protest. Here's an example of Shafer saying just that on an episode of Tim Pool's

142
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:35,680
podcast. A lot of people grift and they use field reporting sort of there's this way to get in front

143
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,600
of the camera, and their ultimate goal is they want to be a host. This is very common, right? I

144
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,160
happen to have had a podcast before I went out on the field myself. It's always been coinciding.

145
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,880
My podcast has always been about what I see on the field. So there's sort of that duplicity.

146
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,680
He describes it a bit more clearly here and how he doesn't see this as a grift. A lot of people,

147
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,680
like I said, use reporting to get the job that they want because I think generals are made in

148
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,840
the trenches. I don't think that's a grift per se. The problem with his reasoning though is that,

149
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:06,800
particularly in these early videos, he's not actually doing real reporting. He's going out

150
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,120
with a political goal to make these people he disagrees with politically look stupid.

151
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:17,200
As a result, these protests are framed as random assemblies of people who don't particularly know

152
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,520
why they're there or what they believe and who are deeply confused about the world around them.

153
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,280
It's at odds with other types of protest coverage where you might get clips like this.

154
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,200
Them people who are out there when they go back in the morning to get us jobs, get us loans,

155
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:35,520
get us, give us access, give us a chance. If we don't get no economic justice, we're still going

156
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,480
to be in a situation that we're walking around and police are going to be able to do whatever

157
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,640
they want to do to us. Or maybe something like this. I think there's an issue with people thinking

158
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,920
that this is solely an American thing. It's not an American thing solely. White supremacy is

159
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,400
worldwide and we need to acknowledge that a lot of the foundations for white supremacy in America

160
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:58,160
are built in the UK. These are interviews with people who have genuinely and firmly held beliefs

161
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,760
and what's more they give you an understanding of why people are attending these protests and what

162
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,240
they're hoping to achieve. You still may not agree with them but at the very least you understand

163
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,800
where they're coming from. Shafer was not interested in producing this type of understanding

164
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,240
but rather videos he could use for mockery. The goal of these videos isn't to build a resume of

165
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,680
genuine reporting to lead to the job of talk show host but rather conservative theater dressed up

166
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:26,720
as journalism that would lead to a job spouting out propaganda to advance a right-wing agenda.

167
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,360
These protest videos were an immediate success and Shafer was quickly embraced by the world of

168
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,000
right-wing media particularly because as Shafer describes himself they were used to target a

169
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,440
younger audience which the right-wing traditionally struggled with. My mission now is to bring the

170
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,760
truth to expose the truth and to do it in a way that attracts young people. Shafer's overt professions

171
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:52,480
of faith were present throughout his work in the early parts of his career as well. This may very

172
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,720
well have put him on the radar of the religious right establishment, at least the part of that

173
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,520
establishment that works in media, and he soon found himself with a plum spot working for Glenn

174
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,320
Beck. Glenn Beck quite famously made a name for himself railing against Barack Obama during his

175
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,200
first presidential term. His rise in conservative media was speaking to the Christian right. Here's

176
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:20,160
an example from his restoring honor rally from 2010. America today begins to turn back to God.

177
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:26,320
And here's another interesting clip from 2008 that reveals the specific audience Glenn Beck is

178
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,280
speaking to. I get so much email on this and I think a lot of people do and I've only got a

179
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:38,960
couple of seconds. Odds that Barack Obama is the Antichrist. No chance. First let's take a moment

180
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,520
to applaud Glenn Beck for clearing the very low bar of saying that Barack Obama is not, in fact,

181
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,400
the Antichrist. But more important in that clip was him saying how often he had been asked that

182
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:53,360
question by his audience. This isn't a broad religious audience. He's cultivated, but rather

183
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,080
the conservative Christian audience that has been shaped from decades of propaganda, making them

184
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,960
tools of the Republican Party. One thing I should distinguish here is that Christianity in and of

185
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:09,600
itself is multifaceted with many denominations ascribing to a wide variety of political domains.

186
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:15,040
The group that follows and listens to the likes of Glenn Beck or Elijah Shafer, seeing their

187
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,840
Christianity reflected in their conservative activism, are a very specific subset that have

188
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:24,720
been cultivated and shaped by propaganda, making them the tools of conservative politicians.

189
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,440
Although it certainly is an interesting question as to how much of conservative politics is shaped

190
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:34,400
by the Christian right and vice versa, that's a bit outside the bounds for this video. Glenn Beck,

191
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:39,200
who faced a lot of outside pressure, including boycotts that negatively affected his advertising

192
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,920
at the time, eventually left Fox News, albeit ignoring an offer from the channel to keep him

193
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:49,040
on the air. Beck started his own media company, The Blaze, which would eventually become Blaze

194
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:56,080
Media in 2018 after a merger with Mark Levin's CRTV. The arrival of Blaze Media into Shafer's

195
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,040
career speaks to the institutional support right-wing figures such as himself have access to.

196
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,440
In the independent media space, it's a simple fact that the left is vastly underfunded,

197
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:11,040
particularly on YouTube. For every major operation, such as The Young Turks, you have Blaze Media,

198
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,360
The Daily Wire, and others who have multiple hosts and shows operating underneath them.

199
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:20,400
There are just way more opportunities on the right, with figures sometimes plucked from

200
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,360
obscurity and placed in positions of prominence, or for YouTubers who develop an audience and then

201
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,600
have their show folded into that network, with prominent examples being Steven Crowder,

202
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,640
Lauren Chen, and of course, Elijah Shafer. While working for Blaze Media, Shafer's profile would

203
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,760
continue to rise, perhaps most famously covering the Black Lives Matter protest throughout 2020.

204
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,160
His coverage was largely focused on spectacle more so than context and information. Though

205
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,160
Shafer did certainly conduct interviews, the stories that seemed to get the most play were

206
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,880
images of violence. This is where Shafer was ostensibly transitioning from someone who went

207
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,880
to protests to make people look stupid to reporting on the facts on the ground, though

208
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,360
he was often selective with the facts he chose to present. Here's how Shafer describes that

209
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,680
experience in an interview with Ali Beth Stuckey from 2021. It seemed that almost like God's hand

210
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:14,320
was on my life to put me in the worst situations possible, but to protect me. And here's one

211
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,400
specific incident they mention. The group of people nearly killing a man, splitting his head

212
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,280
open with the skateboard trucks and laughing and people spitting on him and then watching after they

213
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:30,640
broke. That was in Dallas. I think I remember this. This was a guy trying to defend a business

214
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,200
against the rioters with a machete and then the rioters basically bashed his head in until he

215
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,440
was unconscious, right? It's interesting how Stuckey provided the additional context here

216
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,600
because it mimics what went wrong with Shafer's coverage of this event. When Shafer posted this

217
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:48,640
video on Twitter in May of 2020, it showed a scene of about five or six people attacking a

218
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:53,040
man lying helpless on the ground while a dozen more stood around watching and shouting. I can't

219
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,800
play the clip because of YouTube's restrictions on violent footage, but it's linked below if you'd

220
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:01,920
like to check it out. The video was viewed 35 million times, and though there's some text

221
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:06,640
providing a bit of context, it's obviously positioned to portray this man as an innocent victim.

222
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:11,680
The narrative was pounced on by conservative media, eventually filtering its way up to President Trump.

223
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,880
Innocent people have been savagely beaten like the young man in Dallas, Texas who was left dying

224
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:24,080
on the street. About an hour and a half after this video was first posted, Shafer made another

225
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,800
tweet with a longer version of the video, where 18 additional seconds revealed that this beating

226
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,760
was immediately preceded by this man screaming while swinging a machete as he charged towards

227
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:44,320
the group that would eventually attack him. This video was viewed 3.7 million times. The second

228
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,640
tweet also reveals that he has no idea if this guy was the owner of the story he was supposedly

229
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,960
defending or even what his name is, but he does assure his audience that this man, who showed up

230
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,400
to protest with the machete, was not the instigator that night. Here's a statement on the event from

231
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,440
Dallas Police. According to witnesses, the individual who came to the protest wheeled on a large knife

232
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,840
slash machete at several protesters. An unknown protester was attempting to fight off this

233
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,000
individual by using his skateboard and was subsequently cut in the hand, but not before

234
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,800
disarming the individual. At this time, the crowd of protesters began assaulting the individual.

235
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:21,280
As mentioned, the individual with the large knife was taken to the hospital and was last reported to

236
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,840
be in stable condition. Neither the individual who was cut in the hand nor anyone in the way of the

237
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,320
knife-wielding individual have come forward to file the complaint. Another video taken at night

238
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,080
by a student, Yul Myasho, showed the event from another angle. Here's an excerpt from the

239
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,880
Intercept article that spoke to him. In a phone interview, Myasho said that he started recording

240
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,960
just after the man with the machete pulled it out and threatened the skateboarder who was slightly

241
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,520
ahead of the rest of the group. Myasho insisted that, although glass was broken at hatchways at

242
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:54,400
some point on Saturday night, there was no violence or looting of any kind when the man confronted the

243
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,040
skateboarder. A fuller examination of the facts revealed that this man with the machete to be less

244
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:04,400
an innocent victim and more active participant in escalating tensions that night. A flatter reading

245
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:09,600
of this situation might be that a man showed up to a Black Lives Matter protest brandishing a machete

246
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,400
in a threatening fashion. When protesters started throwing trash at him to get him to go away,

247
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:19,520
he instead decided to charge at them screaming while swinging around the machete. The protesters

248
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,040
responded by disarming him and then attacking him. It doesn't make any of what happened that night

249
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:29,200
right, but it does reveal that Shafer had a very specific agenda when he edited the footage to

250
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,160
remove that context. He very much wanted his audience to see Black Lives Matter protesters as

251
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:39,920
unthinking mindless vandals attacking helpless individuals who are trying to protect businesses,

252
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:45,280
eliminating any context that might present this individual as reckless and irresponsible.

253
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,520
Shafer's perspective appears to be colored by his own biases against the protesters and his own

254
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:53,520
personal conservative religious perspective. The way that they were pushing for everything

255
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:58,960
demonic to change their gender, to explore their sexuality, and the way that they expressed that

256
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:05,280
together of like, let's get together and let's do evil things. Let's hurt people. Let's kill people.

257
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,120
Let's steal things. Let's destroy things. I mean, there is no other way to describe the energy there

258
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:16,960
than purely satanic from hell. Here's another story Shafer mentioned in this interview. You

259
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:21,440
know, someone had just put a gun into my face and I think the gun jammed or they pulled the

260
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,400
trigger and it's on footage. This footage of someone apparently trying to murder Shafer

261
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:32,320
can be found on his Twitter account in a five second clip he posted. What do we do? That's right.

262
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,760
Whoa, that's right, man. It's hard to really know what's going on with five seconds taken out of

263
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,560
what was likely a much longer day of filming, but let's deal with the obvious problem here.

264
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,720
Pointing a gun at someone, even an unloaded one, is incredibly reckless and should not be condoned.

265
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,560
Regardless of what anyone might think of Shafer and what he's arrived to do there,

266
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:57,760
pointing a gun at the guy is clearly out of bounds. I would like to note that this irresponsible

267
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,400
behavior, though, doesn't quite match how Shafer presented it in the interview. Even though it was

268
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,240
reckless, it does appear to have been done for dramatic effect and doesn't really seem like

269
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,200
someone is trying to kill him. Shafer himself even said as much when speaking to Fox News at the time.

270
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,320
I don't think he pointed the gun at me to try to kill me. I think he was one of the stupidest people

271
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,480
in the world. In a video posted four days after those comments were published, he said this to

272
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,840
Mark Levin. All I can credit is God for that. I'm really true. I'm not trying to be a martyr here.

273
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,160
I'm not saying I'm special. I'm not saying I actually was going to die. But the fact that as

274
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,160
we just saw last night, it's very, very probable and possible that you can die at these things.

275
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:40,880
This is a pattern with much of Shafer's reporting. Footage, often very heavily edited,

276
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,440
is presented in a deliberate effort to frame protesters as violent or dangerous.

277
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,680
And the story is less about the reasons for violence at these demonstrations and instead

278
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:54,720
Shafer inserting himself into the narrative as a victim. He is showing up to these protests,

279
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,360
not as a neutral presence, but as someone who is being targeted by the left and therefore

280
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,440
their opposition. That group right there that was assaulting me with their camera that was coming

281
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,880
up to me. This is all very ironic because as much as he may talk about how dangerous violence from

282
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:14,080
protesters are, he does describe the most debilitating injury he got as being not from

283
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,960
left wing protesters, but rather the police. Department of Homeland Security is the one who's

284
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,040
hurt me the worst, not actually Antifa. What was the situation? It was at the federal courthouse

285
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,840
and they just shot with a gas powered like point blank with a like whatever flash being in my

286
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,200
shin and just cracked open my shin. It's strange how he fixates on the left being dangerous and

287
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:40,640
out of control. But when the police injure him, that doesn't lead to any thought about how heavily

288
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,360
armed the police are and the way in which they deploy that force against unarmed people.

289
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,080
By framing himself as a victim, Shafer is vilifying the left, something he was doing

290
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,320
in his earlier work as well. Contriving conversations to make protesters look bad

291
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,760
just turned into making himself a victim, also to vilify the protesters. And while there might be

292
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,120
an interesting conversation as to how we understand violence that happens at demonstrations,

293
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,080
or how some people who attend protests may not have the best or most well thought out takes,

294
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,640
the issue I really want to focus on is that Shafer is clearly and obviously operating with

295
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,000
an agenda. He is not a neutral journalist or reporter in any sense of the word, he is showing

296
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,240
up to be a propagandist. And this is very explicitly a religious political operation for him.

297
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,760
The narratives that have been given to the people in the church are progressive narratives,

298
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,920
they come from Satan, they're from the mouth of Beezlebug himself. And if you still somehow think

299
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:38,160
Shafer is acting like a journalist, here he is on his show describing why he highlights

300
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:42,480
specific footage of people at protests. Well, people say, well, why do you film these people?

301
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,640
It is genuinely to publicly mock them. And it is because it works.

302
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,080
Mockery is the point. This isn't journalism, it's propaganda.

303
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:56,080
There was one notable exception in Shafer's career though, when he quite famously attended

304
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,800
the January 6th Capitol riot where hundreds of Trump supporters broke into the Capitol building

305
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,920
in an effort to overturn the democratic election of Joe Biden. At the time, Shafer seemed almost

306
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:11,120
jubilant, as he described it as a revolution in progress, and he took some heat for photographing

307
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,320
a computer screen in Nancy Pelosi's office. At the time, Shafer did have some less than comforting

308
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,280
words for Trump supporters. The Trump supporters that are denying that Trump supporters could do

309
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:26,960
this, I mean, have you not heard the sentiments from people who follow Trump? I mean, they are

310
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,000
pissed, they are upset. I made a whole video on Tucker Carlson's Patriot Purge series,

311
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,240
but I want to highlight one section where Shafer appears. This time, his tone towards

312
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,840
Trump supporters has changed a bit. January 6th was just, you know, mom and dad who were mad

313
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,720
about what they saw to be an election that they thought was unfair, rigged, fortified, stolen. It

314
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,480
doesn't matter what you say it is, they were just angry and a lot of them just got caught up in the

315
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,280
front lines of chaos. They thought that rioting was like a game, maybe. Supposedly, the violence

316
00:27:55,280 --> 00:28:01,680
of January 6th is excused as manipulation by the FBI of innocent Trump supporters, but violence

317
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,640
at a BLM protest is some kind of demonic presence on earth. Throughout 2020 and 2021, Shafer

318
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,280
transitioned to doing more in-studio work, hosting Slightly Offensive and You Are Here,

319
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:18,480
with the latter being co-hosted by right-wing commentator Sydney Watson. This part of Shafer's

320
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,600
career starts to get really nasty, and he spends less time on the illusion of grappling with the

321
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,640
idea of his political opponents and instead mocking their appearance. They cut their breasts off,

322
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,440
they have scars, they all look like Hillary Clinton after she lost another election,

323
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,760
butch haircuts, depression in the eyes, and you just go, man, if you were living a life

324
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,080
that led to wholeness, why do you look like that? Many of his videos include moments like that,

325
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,880
picking out random people, often videos circulated by the ellipse of TikTok Twitter account,

326
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,360
which he notes as a friend of his, and mocking their appearance. Here's another example.

327
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,640
I love that we all got to go to the zoo for free today. You saw a couple of hippopotamuses and then

328
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:01,840
an elephant in the beginning. It always is the women who are incapable of naturally getting

329
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:07,440
impregnated that have the most complaints about abortion. Much of his content is just this vicious

330
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,920
bullying of random people on the internet with no real power. At this point in his career,

331
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,760
it's the main tool Shafer uses, although there is an alternative he mentions. Somebody asked me,

332
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,960
they think the only other alternative is like violence. So it's like you could either A,

333
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,160
mock the people or B, kill them. And I'm going to say there's two options. One of them is illegal

334
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,240
and you'll go to prison. The other one, you get to have a show and you get to collect Barbies.

335
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,800
So, you know, I take, I'll take the first one in the moment and I try to avoid the violence

336
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,400
for as long as possible in life. It's kind of him to say he's willing to avoid violence

337
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,960
for the moment. And this brings us to Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse and Shafer are bros,

338
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,520
and Shafer quite infamously interviewed Rittenhouse shortly before he killed two men and wounded

339
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:55,120
another at a BLM demonstration. And afterwards, he was quickly branded a conservative hero.

340
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,000
After Rittenhouse was found not guilty of murder, he appeared on Shafer's You Are Here show

341
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,920
for a conversation that can be described as very friendly. This interview is not an easy watch,

342
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:10,880
largely because there's far too much discussion about all the women Rittenhouse wants to have sex

343
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,520
with. The main purpose, though, is summed up by Shafer here. Just it's just cool to know,

344
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:20,320
though, that you are a real person, that you're not a meme. Shafer wanted to humanize Rittenhouse,

345
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,880
to reaffirm to his far right audience that in spite of the fact that Rittenhouse will supposedly

346
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,240
claim to support BLM, at the end of the day, Rittenhouse is one of their guys, a tool to be

347
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,560
wielded against the left, because he's willing to use violence against their political opposition.

348
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:38,160
It's why another running theme through this interview is the jovial celebration of the

349
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,120
violence committed by Rittenhouse. And you were armed, and unlike some people that that that

350
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:47,680
fateful night, they didn't listen to the directions of somebody with a firearm, but I was smart

351
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:58,160
enough. And when I mention Shafer having a far right audience, this will become increasingly

352
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:03,760
clear as we examine the topics and talking points that he uses. The right wing embrace of Rittenhouse

353
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:09,200
is not a product of someone acting in self defense in and of itself, but rather for taking violent

354
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,200
action against political opposition. Had Rittenhouse been, as is often framed, defending himself in a

355
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,000
completely different setting with no political dimension, say the parking lot of them all, I

356
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:25,520
suspect he would not be so readily embraced by the right wing. The fact that he was defending himself

357
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:30,080
in the midst of a Black Lives Matter protest against those who were on that particular side

358
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:35,040
of the political divide is precisely why he's heralded as a hero. It's about normalizing

359
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:41,200
violence against the political opposition. Elijah Shafer is, as I've hopefully demonstrated at this

360
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,600
point, a religious ideologue who will tacitly endorse violence against his opposition, from

361
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,720
celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse to creating a false dichotomy of mockery or violence, to casting his

362
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:56,720
opponents as literal demons. The implication is the same. The other side of the political spectrum

363
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:03,120
is deserving of violence, and should be seen as inherently evil. He's not explicitly saying

364
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,160
people should be violently attacked, but he understands and sympathizes with that approach,

365
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,640
and he might even call you a hero if you do it. But there's more to this guy than religiously

366
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,800
motivated violence. He also has some issues with the LGBT community. Here he is making what I

367
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:34,240
assume are jokes. I can't speak for the gay community myself, but I am offended on behalf

368
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:40,320
of anyone who enjoys comedy for that exchange. These jokes aren't entirely stylistic, though.

369
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:45,120
Shafer uses humor much in the way the alt-right used irony and sarcasm to mask their true intent,

370
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,240
and charismatically attract a younger audience who appreciate edgy jokes, even if it's more edge

371
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,520
than joke. I don't know if this is a deliberate tactic Shafer is using, or if it's just his brand

372
00:32:55,520 --> 00:33:00,640
of humor, but it does explain his success regardless. Painful attempts at homophobic humor

373
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,600
aside, and there are countless jokes Shafer makes about being gay, he does eventually let slip what

374
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,800
his real concerns are. Thirteen-year-olds like this guy he would argue should look at porn, and so

375
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,080
what's the difference of looking at porn or getting involved in a sexual confrontation with

376
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,800
an adult online, and I think that they're planning ahead decades so that they can have sex with kids

377
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:23,920
in the metaverse? That's where I think we're headed. They, whoever they are, are playing a

378
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:29,920
very long game by normalizing pedophilia now so they can have sex with kids in the metaverse

379
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:35,200
in the future. The logic of this plan escapes me, as it's weird that these supposed groomers are

380
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,160
expecting to still be virile enough 30 years into the future. This is an example of how Shafer

381
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:46,320
analyzes the news. He connects a vague fear of big tech with a groomer conspiracy theory to shape

382
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,160
nonsensical narratives, narratives that are very evocative of old Christian conservative arguments.

383
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,800
The groomer narrative that has been so popular on the right lately has been something Shafer has

384
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,080
been exposing for a while. Here he is talking about it in 2021. Even with the gay pride stuff,

385
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,680
originally it was like dude don't you just want gay people to be able to do what they want to do

386
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:10,160
in their closet? And you're like okay fine go ahead and then now it's like yeah if you want

387
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,560
them to have sex with your kid you're the bigot. None of these ideas are new and Shafer's opinions

388
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,280
are just regurgitated right-wing propaganda. This same rhetoric was used to attack the gay

389
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:26,000
community for decades. Here's an example from 1961's Boys Beware. Jimmy didn't know was that

390
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:32,880
Ralph was sick. A sickness that was not visible like smallpox but no less dangerous and contagious.

391
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:39,920
A sickness of the mind. You see Ralph was a homosexual. A person who demands an intimate

392
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:46,480
relationship with members of their own sex. 60 years later the message is the same. People outside

393
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:51,280
the cis heterosexual category should be considered dangerous. Here are some examples of Shafer's

394
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,120
rhetoric getting even more extreme. They want what they cannot have or the last bastion besides

395
00:34:57,120 --> 00:35:00,640
forcibly raping and killing the kids while you have sex with them which is eventually where they

396
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,440
want to go right. And in this very video he ends with a particularly chilly note. You want me to

397
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:10,800
say your pronouns? Ask me if I care if you died today. I literally don't care. You could literally

398
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:15,680
get hit by a bus and the world would be boom. And here he is being even more explicit responding

399
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,880
to a video that discusses how to use more inclusive language to describe intersex people.

400
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:25,360
My advice is to use language that focuses on function and not just form. That means focusing

401
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,200
on the actual function that you're talking about such as people who can get pregnant,

402
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,200
people who can get other people pregnant, people who are at risk of testicular cancer and so on

403
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,360
and so forth. Where's Kyle Rittenhouse when you need him? You know that's all when I watch these

404
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:43,920
people I have no other thoughts. You are to me a potential child molester and you are a

405
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,240
child predator. You are a threat and threats need to be neutralized. Yeah and we don't advocate

406
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:52,880
for killing people. I mean Drew Hernandez immediately has to help Shafer walk back these

407
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,000
comments. Though saying someone needs to be neutralized has a pretty clear implication.

408
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,640
Elijah Shafer thinks trans and non-binary people's lives aren't worth caring about

409
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:08,880
and if they make their identities visible around children they should be, in his words, neutralized.

410
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,400
What makes all of this moral panic so unconvincing is how it fixates on members of the LGBT community.

411
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,360
Overwhelmingly, child predators are straight and cisgender. Something that's obviously true when

412
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:24,080
you consider the relative size of populations being discussed. If discussions of sexuality around

413
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:28,560
children marks someone as a groomer, most of the efforts should be focused on stopping straight

414
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,920
cisgender people from mentioning their sexuality around children. Never mind, gender identity is

415
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,360
actually distinct from sexuality and is relatively harmless when being discussed around anybody.

416
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:45,120
But of course there is no discussion around displays of heterosexual sexuality around children

417
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,920
because this was never about protecting children. It was about demonizing trans and non-binary

418
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,480
people the same way it was used and continues to be used against gay people. The religious right

419
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,440
has long been a political adversary to the LGBT community and Shafer is once again perfectly

420
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,880
happy to take up that cause, even endorsing violence on the basis of a lie. This isn't the

421
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,080
only community Shafer has a problem with though. For example, he quite infamously tweeted this out,

422
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:15,520
I despise the Chinese so much because I was with them my whole life. We always had exchange

423
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,800
students. Even as an adult, my roommates were rich Chinese pretending to care about education.

424
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,080
I know what few will admit. They are our enemies. It's competition. You're the dumb one.

425
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,880
This tweet was deleted but he still has several up clarifying his position.

426
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:36,400
Chinese citizens rape our system to use it against us. Sorry the haters don't realize this.

427
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,320
They admit this to me. Only Twitter people pretend this isn't true. Americans who are Asian are my

428
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:46,960
friend but CCP funded plants are not. I'm aware of the difference and don't care about your

429
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,320
political correctness. Our nations are at war and I'm not playing nice. There were several other

430
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:56,880
tweets like this and I hope those were clear enough. This goes beyond being opposed to the

431
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,160
government of China and extends that opposition to all Chinese nationals. Shafer sees them as

432
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:06,560
enemies as if every Chinese person is an unthinking pawn of their government and no

433
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,000
independent thought exists there in a country of over one billion people. There's no other way

434
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,200
to see this than bigotry against the Chinese but this is a bit more insidious than that as we look

435
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,520
deeper into Shafer's comments on immigration because it gets at the heart of another issue

436
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:26,640
he's talking about. That he's very concerned that the United States of America is becoming less white.

437
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,680
Here's a clip of him expressing that in a 2021 video on Tim Pool's podcast.

438
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,280
One thing that I can agree with critical race theory on is they do say that America was made

439
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:40,480
by white people for white people and I've read the documents and before 1965 it specifically

440
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:45,120
states like for our posterity when the immigration laws were changed when we had this similar

441
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:49,920
biosphere and there was there was this majority of people in every nation whether it's religion,

442
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:54,880
race, it's culture, there has to be shared value and we were sold this future for America which

443
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,960
was a total scam and I believe had communist influence. What Shafer is referring to here is

444
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,320
the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, a topic that is very much a pain point among

445
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:08,880
white nationalists. This federal law abolished quotas on immigration that were established in

446
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,600
the 1920s which were designed to maintain a specific ethnic diversity of the country.

447
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:19,360
In other words the law Shafer so upset about was done to counter another law that was explicitly

448
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,080
racist which was designed to keep non-white people from immigrating to the United States.

449
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:29,680
Shafer favors a law that ensures the country remains overwhelmingly white which means that

450
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:35,680
particular group would hold all the political power. This is I think quite obviously a white

451
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,720
nationalist talking point. In this conversation Shafer tries to deflect this obviously racist

452
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:45,120
point he's making to claim he's worried about some kind of communist plot to overthrow the

453
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:50,640
country. This conspiracy theory is a rambling mess that doesn't really make sense. Eventually Shafer

454
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,520
gets called out by Tim Poole for making a racist argument and I can't believe I just said that.

455
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,760
Number one reason why I'm saying why expats don't fit in is because in America it's seen as being

456
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,760
really great to share your political views you actually are like seen as sort of being brave

457
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,320
and in Japan you will be ostracized. There's a word for that. They're racist. Well how is that

458
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:14,320
racism if Japan is literally racist they're an ethno state and they do not they they don't. How

459
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:19,840
is that racism of a homogeneous Japanese culture wanting to preserve a certain ethnic group? About

460
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,880
a year later we see more of Shafer's thoughts on immigration describing security at the border.

461
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:28,080
Like like the border situation right we can't figure out what to do with people catch and release

462
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,640
title 42. We don't know what's going on like it is hard to know what to do but in the end there

463
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,680
has been situations where people have taken a similar approach they got the shit beat out of

464
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,160
them like knocked out hypothetically so you get beat up you get shot or whatever. I don't know if

465
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,080
that's the solution and if it's on YouTube and you look it up but it's also the fact is that some

466
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:47,760
people have taken that approach of like just going to violence and to be honest it worked.

467
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,560
The comfort Shafer has with discussing violence this time referring to people crossing the border

468
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,600
illegally is worrying but of course it doesn't end there. Shafer has a history of sharing white

469
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:03,280
nationalist memes like this one below using the black sun symbol a symbol by the way which was

470
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,480
used by the recent racist massed shooter in buffalo who deliberately targeted black people.

471
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,760
More than sharing memes and talking points Shafer has made other overtures to the extreme far right.

472
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,520
Anytime slander comes from the media I'm like that person is probably cool like hey

473
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,480
that's a that's a nazi I'm like let me go speak to which brings us to Elijah Shafer's on air

474
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,280
conversations with Nick Fuentes. If you're not familiar with the name I recommend this video

475
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:32,960
from Mildred of the Goo Realm who details how Nick Fuentes pushes fascism from his weird

476
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:38,000
little corner of the internet into the mainstream. Fuentes had a YouTube channel until it was banned

477
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,960
for hate speech and this article has a helpful comment on Fuentes's view on white nationalism.

478
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:46,720
The reason I wouldn't call myself a white nationalist it's not because I don't see

479
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,480
the necessity for white people to have a homeland and for white people to have a country

480
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,240
it's because I think that kind of terminology is used almost exclusively by the left into fame and

481
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,200
I think the terminology and the labels that we use I don't think that we can look at them outside of

482
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,880
the context of their connotations in America. Fuentes very deliberately and carefully crafts

483
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,320
his image to be as far right as possible while still having a degree of plausible deniability

484
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:17,120
or at least plausible to anyone who isn't paying close attention to the fascism he's obviously

485
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:21,920
trying to push. One notable moment in Fuentes's career was when he decided to ambush Ben Shapiro

486
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:26,480
in the middle of the street when he was with his family and while anyone familiar with this channel

487
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,800
knows I have no love for Ben Shapiro aside from his wonderful fiction about political correctness

488
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,920
leading to a nuclear bomb going off I do think it's incredibly disrespectful and gross to confront

489
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,680
him and put his family including his children on camera. Although certainly not the worst thing

490
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:46,240
Fuentes has ever done I wanted to bring it up because his cameraman that day happened to be

491
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:51,440
Elijah Shafer. And that footage that we just saw that interaction with Ben I happen to have filmed

492
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:56,560
and I guess this means that we have a history of being around the same circles. What's interesting

493
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:00,560
about this interview is not just that Shafer is having a friendly chat with a white nationalist

494
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,600
but that he has actively participated in something Fuentes has been very vocal about with his tactics

495
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:10,240
finding ways to soften his extreme rhetoric to make it more appealing to a wide audience.

496
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,800
Shafer interviewed Fuentes twice that day once on his slightly offensive show and then

497
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,480
on You Are Here. The You Are Here one is a bit tough to watch as Shafer's co-host Sydney Watson

498
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:25,040
makes it clear she had never heard of Fuentes and she seems a bit shaken by some of his opinions.

499
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:30,080
The old world the old way of doing things. Women don't drive don't vote type of thing or something

500
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:34,800
like that I mean approximating like Saudi Arabia I don't think they're too far off the mark. I mean

501
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,000
you could potentially go and live in Saudi Arabia then. Watson is not up to the task of pushing back

502
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:44,320
in a meaningful way against Fuentes even when he's talking about taking away all of her rights

503
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:48,720
and towards the end of the interview she says this. It's really funny people are like Sydney's

504
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:52,080
really triggered and I'm honestly just sitting here just listening and just you know getting a

505
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:56,400
feel for things but I was saying to Elijah it's interesting I think you're being very respectful

506
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,800
and it's and I think that's really nice because people make you out to be this you know assassin

507
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,080
that's going to just stab everybody in the face. So while Fuentes may want to turn her into a

508
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:11,120
second-class citizen reducing her to an incubator for children Watson appreciates that he's at least

509
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:17,040
willing to have a civil conversation about it so that's lovely. Shafer takes the opposite approach

510
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,600
not in that he more aggressively pushes back against Fuentes so much as he's interested in

511
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:28,640
coaching him. Here's a quick example you know 3.8 billion dollars per year for Israel and and all

512
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:34,320
of this you know how how can you really say you're America first if you're so fixated on the benefit

513
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:37,600
of another country and she would. Can I ask you a question there though before you even give her

514
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,680
answer is like so when you say this this is where a lot of people I think get turned off even these

515
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:46,720
kind of questions because obviously I know where this is headed is like was your was your question

516
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,840
just on foreign aid in general or did you see something like I could question a foreign aid

517
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:56,880
but not to this country. This is a very astute place to cut Fuentes off what could have turned

518
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,560
into a very anti-Semitic rant is quickly reframed to sound like Fuentes is just concerned about

519
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,600
foreign aid as if there's nothing about Israel or the Jewish people Fuentes has a problem with.

520
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,160
The briefest of glances into Fuentes's history reveals numerous anti-Semitic statements and

521
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,400
beliefs it's almost trivial to find clips of him jokingly denying the Holocaust or saying the

522
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:22,400
Jewish people aren't part of western civilization or how he has concerns over Jewish power and while

523
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:28,160
I'm citing this ADL article to demonstrate Fuentes's anti-Semitic past Shafer himself actually pulled

524
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:32,000
it up during his interview with Fuentes and addressed it like this. There's nowhere like

525
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,760
here's where Nick Fuentes beat up a black guy and said the n-word like there's nothing like this

526
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:41,600
it's just these these ideas like he wants to fight against transgenderism like well I do too

527
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:46,480
so and then everyone watching this is like yeah yeah you know it's that's cool then they go Fuentes

528
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:50,880
has used his platform to make numerous anti-Semitic and racist comments so you didn't do anything

529
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,000
racist or anti-Semitic you made jokes in here and said some things you said some bad things

530
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,760
apparently according to these standards I'm just saying what it says. It's really something

531
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:04,960
watching Shafer in real time not actually engaging with any of the evidence cited but gently

532
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,120
hand waving it away given his audience the impression that he's providing a rebuttal

533
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:14,560
the incredibly racist and anti-Semitic jokes aren't considered racist because Fuentes didn't

534
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:20,320
literally beat up a black guy while shouting the n-word also they aren't jokes here's a tweet

535
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:25,760
Fuentes makes that Shafer doesn't acknowledge at all any serious person thinking about globalization

536
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:30,720
and demographic changes should actually care a lot about racial differences in intelligence

537
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:35,840
but this subject doesn't interest you because it's not convenient for your Trojan horse brand of

538
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:42,400
kosher nationalism that's not a joke and neither is this comment from Shafer wants to preserve

539
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,880
white identity I guess in some way and Christianity which is like not very extreme ideas these are

540
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,760
just like it's just apolitical ideology it's one of many that are out there right calling Fuentes's

541
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:58,400
ideas which are white nationalist ideas one of many is certainly true personally I would

542
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:02,960
consider someone tried to make America more like Saudi Arabia including take away the rights of

543
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:10,080
women to be fairly extreme Fuentes is a fascist but this coaching isn't just for the benefit of

544
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:15,120
Fuentes it also helps train his audience as well I'm going to play a short clip from the podcast

545
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:19,040
I Don't Speak German that went over this very interaction the voice you'll be hearing is from

546
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:23,920
one of its co-hosts Jack Graham the job is educating the audience in how you say these

547
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:30,000
things now it's it's like an it's like a course in not just the the ideology but in the how you

548
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,560
present that ideology aesthetically now if you listen to enough of this stuff you imbibe this

549
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,760
you learn how to say it I spend a lot of time going over Elijah Shafer in this video and well

550
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:44,720
yeah I think he sucks I also want to highlight how his success is not purely a product of his

551
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:49,600
own talents he was discovered by people with far more power than he and then given a platform to

552
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:54,080
broadcast his beliefs because those are the sorts of beliefs that these people want to shape the

553
00:47:54,080 --> 00:48:00,640
public discourse as for who they are in this case he was hired by religious conservative Glenn Beck

554
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:05,120
who rose to prominence because he tapped into a religious rights anti-left-wing sentiment

555
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:10,560
something that was cultivated over decades by conservative politics Elijah Shafer will not be

556
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,600
the last of these guys to appear this is a system designed to weaponize religious conservatism

557
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:21,120
against the left and to advance a broader right-wing agenda it's one that's dependent on bringing in

558
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:27,200
voices who espouse a specific worldview and then networking together to overall push this greater

559
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,640
message of religious conservatism and what Shafer might be learning now is that that system

560
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,400
doesn't care about him it just finds him useful while I was working on this video Shafer's co-host

561
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,920
on You Are Here Sydney Watson decided to leave the show while Watson will continue on with Blaize

562
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,360
Media it seems she will not be working alongside Shafer anymore Shafer's reaction on twitter was

563
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:56,320
not great shortly afterwards Shafer made a tweet about Mormons Mormons are not Christians very nice

564
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:02,560
people love them much of my family are LDS but they are going to hell not followers of truth

565
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:07,760
makes me sad but can't deny the gospel I struggle in many ways too so can't condemn

566
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:13,280
but can't pretend their faith isn't already condemned this got a response from Elijah

567
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:20,560
Shafer's very Mormon boss Glen Beck Elijah thank goodness you know the truth assuming I'm one of

568
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:25,680
the many nice people who the Lord has made clear to you is condemned I just need to know if you

569
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:31,280
still want a guy who is going to hell as a mentor Shafer effectively doubled down on his initial

570
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,560
tweet and I can't imagine saying your boss is going to hell is the best career move but this

571
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:40,400
isn't new for Shafer he's spoken many times about how he's gotten in trouble for comments in the

572
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:45,120
past and how he ruffles feathers with his brazen attitude he even has this habit of making these

573
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:50,560
really sad comments about how he's all alone and has lost so many of his friends yeah and now I have

574
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:56,560
like one friend and it's Pamela Anderson my life that she gives me pleasure about but no but I just

575
00:49:56,560 --> 00:50:00,560
meant genuinely as a joke like I was like I've just I've lost pretty much everybody in the last

576
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:05,200
year and I you know so I'm just where I'm at now it's just me in my little home studio and here we

577
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:11,120
are but but the my slightly offensive like absolutely killing it and all my social like

578
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:14,560
everything's just growing and doing well so like I'm like I've never been doing better financially

Shafer has some skill in the game he's playing but maybe it's not enough to create a meaningful

580
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:23,680
career and maybe he'll burn out a few short years after starting and then he'll be replaced by the

581
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:28,880
next guy willing to say and do all the things Shafer does though perhaps not quite as earnestly

582
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,440
after all it's not about the influencers it's about maintaining that system of power that is

583
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:39,200
animated in part by Christian nationalism and that system of power was never built for the

584
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:45,280
people at the very bottom but rather the people at the very top this video could not have been

585
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,040
completed without the very helpful assistance of Daniel Harper the other co-host of the I Don't

586
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:56,880
Speak German podcast I highly recommend it they've done several videos touching on people like Shafer

587
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:02,960
but they specialize on a lot of far right figures shedding light on some really dark disturbing

588
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:07,520
corners of the internet so if you enjoy those sorts of videos uh about those kinds of topics

589
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,000
on my channel I very much recommend checking out their podcast it's really well done and has a lot

590
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:17,520
of information you often won't be hearing anywhere else if you'd like to see more videos like this
