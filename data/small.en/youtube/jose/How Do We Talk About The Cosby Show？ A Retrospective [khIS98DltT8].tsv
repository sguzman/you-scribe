0	9640	The Cosby Show was one of the most successful sitcoms of all time.
9640	15000	Premiering in 1984 and running for eight seasons, it spent five consecutive seasons as the number
15000	17360	one rated show in the United States.
17360	21240	The only other sitcom to do that was All on the Family in the 1970s, and not a single
21240	23560	sitcom has been able to do it since.
23560	28880	At its peak, The Cosby Show is being watched by over a third of all households in America.
28880	33560	Accredited with not only reviving the sitcom genre in the 1980s, The Cosby Show also broke
33560	37560	barriers by being a hit show that featured a black middle-class family.
37560	41560	It won six Emmys during its run, along with countless other awards and accolades.
41560	46200	Though the revelations surrounding Bill Cosby's predatory behavior cast a shadow on the series,
46200	50220	well before then, and certainly during its run, there was a deep critical contention
50220	53840	about what to make of The Cosby Show's vision of the world.
53840	58000	It was a show filled with black culture, but often passed on depicting the realities of
58000	61220	what it meant to be black in America in the 1980s.
61220	65960	The discussion around The Cosby Show is, in many ways, just as, or perhaps even more interesting
65960	70040	than the show itself, but before we dig into what this show means, we have to understand
70040	73500	what it was and the context in which it premiered.
73500	77680	And that will help us understand why it's so hard to know how to talk about The Cosby
77680	78680	Show.
78680	82600	The history of black Americans on television began with marginal roles, often as guest
82600	85000	performers, only making brief appearances.
85000	88800	It wasn't until the 1960s where we started seeing reoccurring roles for black actors,
88800	92920	albeit typically in bit parts, playing two stereotypes inspired by minstrel shows.
92920	97080	It was in this world William H. Cosby found himself when he began working as a stand-up
97080	100520	comedian, performing in San Francisco in the 1960s.
100520	105840	By 1963, he was on The Tonight Show, and he released his first stand-up LP titled Bill
105840	108120	Cosby is a Very Funny Fellow.
108120	109120	Right.
109120	113040	As a black comedian performing in the 1960s, Cosby's comedy style took a shape that would
113040	115720	reflect much of his work throughout his career.
115720	119320	While aware that he was performing to a predominantly white audience, he fashioned his comedy in
119320	120880	a way that would not upset them.
120880	138840	He described it in an interview with the CBC in 1963.
138840	143240	In 1965, Cosby's star kept rising as he landed a starring role in the television series
143240	148400	I Spy alongside Robert Culp, one of the earliest examples of a black actor starring in a drama
148400	149400	series.
149400	153840	Although a first-time actor, Cosby won three Emmys for his portrayal of Agent Alexander
153840	154840	Scott.
154840	158680	Around Bill Cosby, the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s had started to make an
158680	160920	impact in the entertainment world.
160920	164720	Bill Cosby's strategy to address bigotry and racism was to create media that unpacked
164720	166640	the impact it had on children.
166640	172320	In 1968, he presented a film titled Black History, Lost, Stolen, or Strayed.
172320	177640	Now, if you tell the history of slavery right, you've got a big problem on your hands.
177640	181560	The slave trader didn't take some savage out of Africa.
181560	190600	He took a human being, sold him like an animal, and separated him from his family.
190600	194720	America invented the cruelest slavery in the history of them, since it broke up black
194720	195720	families.
195720	201520	After slavery was over, America kept breaking up the black man's family.
201520	204640	And that's some awful history to teach.
204640	209160	Fifty years later, and parts of this film still speak very powerfully, Cosby would continue
209160	213680	to define his comedy and how it reflects upon race, always cognizant of the audience watching
213680	216000	him and the limitations he believed that created.
217000	239760	In the 1970s, we began to see a greater number of shows with predominantly black casts, such
239760	243240	as The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son, and Good Times.
243240	247160	Those that not only highlighted black characters, but gave them a wider range of experiences
247160	249400	and stories than previously seen.
249400	252960	Of course, the 1970s weren't a haven of black representation on TV.
252960	256960	Stereotypes were abundant, with criminals and cop shows often being presented as black,
256960	260400	while black families were typically working class and rarely anything else.
260400	264880	Whereas many black actors found new opportunities on the sitcoms of the 1970s, Bill Cosby instead
264880	269360	starred in the short-lived The Bill Cosby Show, where Cosby played a phys-ed teacher.
269360	271360	It only ran for two seasons.
271360	275320	We spent much of the decade creating entertainment for our younger audience, such as Fat Albert
275320	278600	and the Cosby kids, and appearing on segments of The Electric Company.
278600	282640	He also returned to school, where he earned a doctorate of education from the University
282640	285840	of Massachusetts Amherst in 1977.
285840	290080	Cosby also spent the 1970s becoming a fixture in advertisements, particularly for Jello
290080	294040	and Coca-Cola, further cementing his family-friendly image.
294040	298240	As the 1970s ended, it was believed in Hollywood that sitcoms were becoming less popular with
298240	299240	audiences.
299240	303080	In 1983, only two sitcoms cracked the top 20 most-watched shows on television in the
303080	304200	United States.
304200	308380	As audiences for sitcoms declined, networks started placing a greater emphasis on appealing
308380	313160	to the majority white audience, and that often meant sitcoms starring a black cast, or episodes
313160	315700	touching on the issues of race, were to be avoided.
315700	320280	This was when TV producers Marcie Carsey and Tom Werner approached Bill Cosby about creating
320280	321280	a sitcom.
321280	325400	Though Cosby hadn't worked on a TV series for years, he had still been doing stand-up,
325400	328480	and that was the approach the producers took when speaking to him.
329480	335480	In his monologues, he was talking, as he always did, about the commonality of the human experience,
335480	344760	not the particular specific thing about being a black family with not enough money and not
344760	347400	enough resources in this world today.
347400	352800	So we were trying to bring him back to the premise of what had been his entire career,
352800	356360	which is the commonality, the universality of the human experience.
356360	359920	Cosby's original vision of the show was a working-class family, with himself as a
359920	362920	limo driver and his wife working in-home maintenance.
362920	366440	Due to the influence of the show's producers and Bill Cosby's wife Camille, the show's
366440	370560	premise was changed to make the show's lead couple, Cliff and Claire Huxtable, a doctor
370560	372560	and lawyer, respectively.
372560	374720	This approach was a perfect fit for the decade.
374720	379280	The 1980s marked a stark rise in conservatism in American media, and with that a strong
379280	382400	desire for issues such as race to be considered settled.
382400	387280	This was all under the mantra of colorblindness and the idea that racial discrimination was
387280	388280	over.
388280	392480	The Cosby Show would not be a show about a black family and the unique issues that impacted
392480	397280	black families, it would be about an American family, with the universal issues that supposedly
397280	399800	affected all American families.
399800	404520	In spite of its future success, initially the Cosby Show was a difficult sell to networks.
404520	408200	Comedies were considered dead after all, and the major networks, including NBC, all
408200	409800	passed on the series.
409800	414800	Eventually, NBC reconsidered though, and an order was made for several episodes.
414800	425280	And in 1984, the Cosby Show would go on to dominate television.
425280	429160	Even though the title of the series is The Cosby Show, Cosby didn't use his real name
429160	430480	for his TV family.
430480	434960	He played the role of Heath Cliff Huxtable, the family patriarch, easily identified by
434960	437480	his colorful sweaters and sage advice.
437480	441640	Much of the character and the family of Cliff Huxtable was based on Bill Cosby, with him
441640	446840	similarly having four daughters and one son, and many of his lines were ad-libbed on set,
446840	450080	which had the effect of blending the actor and character together.
450080	454360	His playful attitude with children and unflinching ability to set his kids on the right path
454360	475000	made him one of the most popular fathers in sitcom history.
475000	479240	Claire Huxtable was played by Felicia Rashad, the real force in The Huxtable Home.
479240	482280	Claire offered a strength and grace to hold the family together.
482280	486160	She managed to run a household while being a partner at her law firm, a woman who seemingly
486160	487160	had it all.
487160	490840	Rashad was an accomplished stage actress and is credited for keeping up with the energetic
490840	495040	performance of Cosby, and the pair's chemistry made the Huxtable parents seem like an almost
495040	516800	perfect match.
516800	520400	Lisa Bonet played Denise Huxtable, the second oldest in the family.
520400	524800	She grew from being a studious high school student into a free spirit, so much so that
524800	528480	her character almost seemed transformed by the end of her time on the show.
528480	553680	In the earlier seasons, she was the crush of many young teens watching at home.
553680	558400	Theodore Huxtable, or Theo for short, was played by Malcolm Jamal Warner, the middle
558400	560040	child and only boy.
560040	563800	Theo was often at odds with his parents, having trouble in school and generally making things
563800	565240	a mess for his family.
565240	569160	A less experienced actor than some of his castmates, Warner was chosen because Cosby
569160	582880	considered his performance to feel especially real.
582880	586720	Tempest Bloodsow played Vanessa Huxtable, the second youngest child in the Huxtable
586720	587720	home.
587720	591320	Eleven years old at the series' onset, she's a particularly bright student and even more
591320	593600	clever at finding out how to get things her own way.
593600	597720	Bloodsow's performance is especially impressive considering her age, revealing a real gift
597720	609120	for comedy.
609120	615640	The youngest child in the Huxtable home is Rudy, short for Rudith, played by Keisha Knight-Pulium.
615640	620000	Just painfully cute, Rudy grows considerably throughout the series, going from a darling
620000	623160	child of five to a strong-willed thirteen-year-old.
623160	626160	Originally Rudy was written to be a boy, and Knight-Pulium was only brought in because of
626160	628440	how cute she had appeared in a commercial.
628440	632220	The role came down to Knight-Pulium and a young Julia White, who had later gone to play
632220	649180	Steve Urkel on Family Matters, but the role eventually went to Knight-Pulium.
649180	652860	The last member to join the family in the first season was the oldest Huxtable child,
652860	655060	Sandra, played by Sabrina LaBeouf.
655060	659140	First appearing in episode 10 of the first season, LaBeouf would join the principal cast
659140	660860	in the show's second season.
660860	664500	In the first season, Sandra made a part of the family, albeit in ways that often left
664500	686940	her off-screen, pursuing her education at Princeton.
686940	690460	There's also a number of recurring guest stars on the show, such as Cliff's father
690460	695100	Russell, played by Earl Hyman, his mother Anna, played by Clarice Taylor, and Rudy's
695100	697620	friend Kenny, played by Dionne Richmond.
697620	701860	And the number of celebrity guest stars was enormous on the show, particularly black artists
701860	705920	such as Sammy Davis Jr., Stevie Wonder, and Bebe King.
705920	709540	The show made a concentrated effort to highlight a world where people of all cultures were
709540	713420	shown to be living in friendship and harmony, and particularly highlighted a black family
713420	716420	that embraced culture that reflected their heritage.
716420	719900	Absolutely novel at the time, the series was credited with presenting black culture to
719900	722540	a white audience, creating greater acceptance of it.
722540	726900	But the Huxtables lived in a bubble that was almost never pierced by discussions of race.
726900	731460	Though topics such as sexism, drugs, and learning disabilities would arise in the series, race
731460	733840	was largely subtextual.
733840	737860	This was a deliberate choice by Cosby, and is at the heart of why the show became beloved
737860	745500	by some audiences and hotly debated by others.
745500	749500	The world met the Cosby Show on September 20th, 1984.
749500	755260	The pilot, titled Pilot, began with Claire and the four Huxtable kids, Denise, Theo,
755260	769060	Vanessa, and Rudy, preparing breakfast while dancing to some music.
769060	781620	The cast had a nice, easy chemistry with one another, and we soon meet Cliff.
781620	785780	This moment helped establish the two parenting styles of the Huxtables.
785780	789900	While both Cliff and Claire are firm with their kids, Cliff is very much the goofy one
789900	792300	who enjoys messing around with the children.
792300	796180	Part of the inspiration for the series was the stand-up work Cosby was doing at the time,
796180	811340	and we can see the dialogue borrowed heavily from that material.
811340	815260	The pilot, along with many episodes in the earlier seasons of the Cosby Show, was very
815260	819580	light on plot, instead opting to include a number of scenes that reflected the everyday
819580	823860	moments of raising children, such as when Cliff is briefly introduced to Denise's
824860	833020	The main plotline of this episode, and certainly
833020	837660	its most memorable moment, surrounds Theo's report card, which is filled with straight
837660	838660	Ds.
838660	842940	He and Cliff discuss how low grades will lead to a low-paying job, and the economics
842940	854540	of that reality.
854540	858500	Theo reveals that the pressure of having such successful parents makes him feel as though
858500	861500	his parents don't love him for who he is.
861500	878620	In front of a test audience of kids, this was the moment a lot of them applauded, much
878620	883420	like the studio audience dutifully did after Theo made his point, but for a test audience
883420	893580	of adults, there was a much stronger reaction to the following line.
893580	897940	This moment reflected two very important reasons why the show became such a huge success.
897940	902060	The first was that, by making both perspectives, the child and the adults, it appealed to an
902060	906980	audience across generations, but perhaps more importantly, what adults appreciated was seeing
906980	909780	a parent establishing their authority.
909780	913860	In the early 1980s, what few sitcoms were on the air tended to feature precocious children
913860	916180	who often knew better than the adults around them.
916180	920220	Cliff so clearly demonstrated why he was the father of the family reversed that relationship,
920220	923740	and though it might have seemed novel at the time, it reflected an older vision of how
923740	928620	sitcoms used to work, where children would need a wise father to set their lives in order.
928620	933340	The father-knows-best dynamic was seen in shows such as The Andy Griffith Show, Leave
933340	937220	It to Beaver, and, well, Father Knows Best.
937220	941180	After airing, The Cosby Show was an instant hit, becoming the top-rated show not just
941180	943660	for its night, but for the entire week.
943660	947220	It began a streak of reading success that would propel the series to be the third most
947220	951820	watched show in the United States in its first season, and it was only going up from there.
951820	956140	The Cosby Show's early episodes had a very light, improvisational energy, and this was
956140	959980	reflected in how much of it was put together on the fly, particularly scenes with Bill
959980	960980	Cosby.
960980	964580	Cosby had a tendency to improvise his lines throughout each episode.
964580	968500	Returning to the show's producers, tapings tended to go long as Cosby would frequently
968500	971020	go off script and ad-lib through scenes.
971020	973220	As one example, a scene written as,
973220	986660	Cliff Cooking would turn into this.
986660	989940	This isn't to suggest that the show was entirely improvised, though.
989940	993900	Cosby's earlier work, Educating Children, informed how the series would be put together,
993900	998060	as one of the principles of the show was to create family situations that were realistic,
998060	1001660	which meant plotlines deliberately crafted with that in mind.
1001660	1006500	One example is the episode Goodbye, Mr. Fish, in which the death of Rudy's goldfish Lamont
1006500	1010180	leads Rudy into mourning, and the family holds a funeral to protect Rudy's fragile
1010180	1018140	affections for her now-departed goldfish.
1018140	1036620	They find out Rudy's mourning period isn't as long as they expected.
1036620	1040260	The episode ends with Cliff accidentally dropping the fish into the toilet and the family getting
1040260	1041260	back to normal.
1041260	1045060	It's a realistic depiction of how kids are more resilient than we give them credit for,
1045060	1048380	while still highlighting the importance of a family that acknowledges and makes space
1048380	1050740	for kids to deal with those challenges.
1050740	1054060	But part of the reason the Huxtable Kids are so resilient is that in the early seasons
1054060	1058060	of the series, none of the challenges they personally face are more than a kid could
1058060	1059060	handle.
1059060	1062460	That's not to say that these things don't exist in the world of the Cosby Show.
1062460	1065260	Really bad things never happen to the Huxtable Kids.
1065260	1067600	Bad things only ever happen around them.
1067600	1070900	The episode titled Theo and the Joint from the first season might immediately sound like
1070900	1075300	an episode about Theo trying marijuana, but rather than being tempted by a drug, we instead
1075300	1080020	find out that the mysterious joint, Claire discovers in Theo's textbook, wasn't his,
1080020	1094380	but was hidden there by another student, Tony Braxton.
1094380	1098820	The Huxtables trusts Theo, though he insists on proving his innocence and Tony eventually
1098820	1115560	has a heart-to-heart moment with Dr. Huxtable.
1115560	1120820	This pattern of a Huxtable Kid avoiding danger is repeated in the season 3 episode, Calling
1120820	1148360	Dr. Huxtable where Vanessa's friend is revealed to have been smoking in Vanessa's room.
1148360	1152740	And in season 2's Close to Home, Cliff finds out the daughter of a friend is addicted
1152740	1168080	to drugs.
1168080	1172120	The fear of a child becoming addicted to drugs was a huge part of the 80s, with the launch
1172120	1174640	of anti-drug campaigns such as D.A.R.E.
1174640	1178940	A sitcom tackling these issues made perfect sense, though the Huxtable Kids themselves
1178940	1180820	are never presented to be at risk.
1180820	1184580	If anything, they were the positive influences in their peer group, telling their friends
1184580	1188040	not to smoke, or bringing a random kid home to talk to Cliff.
1188040	1192180	In this way, the Huxtables never felt quite so real as the world around them.
1192180	1195620	The drug-free behavior is often credited to the parenting of the Huxtables.
1195620	1199500	When Theo speaks to Tony about being concerned, here's how Theo explains it.
1199500	1215280	But conversely, when Cliff is talking to his friend, there doesn't seem to be an
1215280	1245220	easy answer as to how his daughter became addicted.
1245220	1249600	When Cliff says it's up to Cindy, his friend's daughter, to write her life, it serves as
1249600	1253600	an acknowledgement of the limitations of good parenting, and falls back on the message
1253600	1256400	of personal responsibility that runs throughout the series.
1256400	1260640	Though considering Theo's moment earlier on, personal responsibility is a trait imbued
1260640	1262640	in kids by their parents.
1262640	1267280	In the episode titled The Shower, Denise holds a bridal shower for her friend Veronica, who
1267280	1277060	is secretly pregnant.
1277060	1281140	Shockingly we find out the pregnancy was a ploy to get permission from her parents to
1281140	1289660	consent to her marriage.
1289660	1293420	Teen pregnancy came up again in the episode titled Denise's Friend, though in that case
1293420	1295220	it was a false alarm.
1295220	1300000	Much like the Huxtable kids and drugs, at no point is Denise ever in danger of becoming
1300000	1301000	pregnant.
1301000	1304280	Those are challenges for other families, not the Huxtables.
1304280	1308000	When it came to helping Veronica, it ended very much the way Close to Home ended, with
1308000	1323560	the Huxtables realizing the limitations of their influence around them.
1323560	1327740	There doesn't seem to be a clear satisfying answer to a situation like this one, but the
1327740	1332500	show's eventual moral of the importance of personal responsibility rings hollow.
1332500	1336300	The show's attempt to depict a realistic home life rests on the assumption of a home
1336300	1340860	life with two devoted parents, who have raised kids that are capable of avoiding serious
1340860	1345220	challenges in the world that go beyond the impact of a heart-to-heart conversation with
1345220	1346520	one of their parents.
1346520	1350140	The safe environment is taken for granted in the Cosby Show, making it easier to deliver
1350140	1352740	the message of personal responsibility.
1352760	1356400	And there are times when that personal responsibility theme, which is constantly hit throughout
1356400	1359160	the series, is completely fair and valid.
1359160	1364200	For instance, in the episode Denise Gets a D, Denise's bad grade forces her to acknowledge
1364200	1365600	her struggles in school.
1382740	1388020	With some help from Claire to encourage her along, Denise is able to take charge of her
1388020	1391000	schoolwork and make a better effort on her essay.
1391000	1394680	Episodes like these, while simple, send a positive message, but they're only possible
1394680	1399360	insofar that they exist in a world where the Huxtable kids are never truly challenged.
1399360	1403720	And when those challenges never permeate the Huxtable household, a place of strong family
1403720	1408440	tides and quality parenting emphasizing personal responsibility, it creates this implication
1408440	1413140	that those who face those challenges have some sort of personal moral failure created
1413140	1415900	by parents who have failed in raising their kids.
1415900	1420420	The Huxtable home is a world unto itself, a place where kids are always safe.
1420420	1423980	One particularly interesting way this is shown to us is how frequently young children take
1423980	1425220	center stage.
1425220	1429180	The series has a number of episodes that are happily narrated as being for the kids.
1429180	1441260	In The Slumber Party, Cliff suggests Rudy holds a sleepover, and when her friends arrive
1441260	1459380	we get a series of small moments of Cliff playing with the children.
1459380	1462340	The editing and natural reactions from the children feel that these scenes had a lot
1462340	1465060	of improvisation in them, and that a lot of fun is being had on set.
1465060	1469180	One of the very positive elements of moments like these is how it depicts a father having
1469180	1473700	fun with kids, something at odds with the more traditional roles for fathers on television,
1473700	1478060	being the strict, disciplinarian, or calm voice of reason, often being detached from
1478060	1482180	their kids and not engaging in fun or playful behavior.
1482180	1485780	The idea of Cliff Huxtable being all of those things expanded the idea of what a father
1485780	1490300	could be, much in the same way depicting Claire as a strong presence in the household as well
1490300	1494420	as being an accomplished professional, expanded the idea of what a mother could be.
1494420	1498680	The Huxtables also had ample time to work together to do nice things for one another,
1498680	1503040	one of the more famous examples is when for the 49th anniversary of Cliff's parents,
1503040	1507720	Russell and Anna, family performed a lip-sync of Ray Charles' Night Time is the Right
1507720	1508720	Time.
1508720	1511840	The Huxtables are very clearly a family with some financial resources.
1511840	1516760	Though a lot of plot lines involve Cliff and Claire imparting financial caution to their
1516760	1520680	children, they can't hide the fact that a family living in a brownstone in Brooklyn,
1520680	1525160	headed by a doctor and lawyer, is probably financially secure.
1525160	1529600	It certainly becomes readily apparent in the season 2 episode titled The Auction, and
1529600	1534640	it Claire bids for a painting by her great uncle, Ellis Wilson, titled Funeral Procession.
1534640	1558160	The
1558160	1564040	very idea of spending $11,000 on a painting is truly jaw-dropping in the context of an
1564040	1568160	upper middle-class family, it still seems like a lot, especially when there are five
1568160	1571640	kids to take care of, but it does reflect the wealth of the Huxtables, and how their
1571640	1576320	status as an average family isn't quite as average as one might initially suspect.
1576320	1580640	This even catches up to Vanessa in the season 3 episode, Vanessa's Rich, where she's
1580640	1583720	teased because her family could afford such an expensive painting.
1583720	1602240	The moral of this episode is that friends are who you make of them and shouldn't be
1602240	1606520	decided by class, though it's strange that when we hear about Vanessa being picked on,
1606520	1608520	it's for her supposed wealth.
1608520	1613840	Of all the forms of discrimination to face the Huxtables, their wealth is an odd choice.
1613840	1618160	While this may seem like the show having a squeamish approach to depictions of discrimination,
1618160	1620860	that wasn't entirely the case.
1620860	1624440	From the first season and onward, the Cosby Show didn't shy away from depicting sexist
1624440	1627660	characters and placing them very much in the wrong.
1627660	1631200	Though there were several examples in the early seasons, it's made most clear with
1631200	1635840	the introduction of Sandra's love interest, Elvin, played by Jeffrey Owens, first appearing
1635840	1639120	in the season 2 episode, Cliff in Love.
1639120	1642920	When we meet Elvin, we've already learned that he and Sandra have a rocky relationship,
1642920	1652920	having just broken up again.
1652920	1674800	When Elvin arrives, we get a sense of what the problem might be.
1674800	1678560	Claire encourages Sandra to move on, and her friends set her up with a guy named Daryl,
1678560	1702200	played by Joseph C. Phillips, who Cliff immediately tests.
1702200	1724540	The idea of being concerned about his daughter dating someone who respects women is a surprisingly
1724540	1728360	refreshing change of pace compared to sitcoms where fathers seem more concerned about their
1728360	1731760	daughter's chastity, as if it were property to be protected.
1731760	1736840	Sadly, much like how this episode ends with Sandra deciding to stay with Elvin, this enlightened
1761760	1774520	character would be a fixture throughout the series, with Jeffrey Owens becoming a recurring
1774520	1778880	guest star in season 2 and joining the principal cast permanently in season 3.
1778880	1782280	Many of the early scenes with Elvin tend to be Cliff teaching him to lose his less
1782280	1799960	enlightened takes, but a kind gesture from Elvin is immediately
1830960	1836320	In this episode, Cliff's lesson to Elvin is to fake being able to make pasta sauce, much in the way Cliff does.
1852000	1855600	While there's something nice about men teaching other men to be better to women,
1855600	1861520	there's a falsity to all of this that doesn't sit well. The very act of cooking your own sauce
1861520	1867600	without making it from scratch hardly seems like a distinction worth making, so what if Cliff or
1867600	1873920	Elvin get their sauce from a jar? But by supposedly making it from scratch, they're taking on a role
1873920	1879040	typically thought of as for women, and they do so so that the fury of the women won't come down
1879040	1883600	upon them. This reveals an essentialism that lies at the heart of the Cosby Show's stance on gender
1883600	1889520	dynamics. Women, of course, can do whatever men do, but the show also posits that they're emotional
1889520	1894560	and scary for these beleaguered men who will say and do whatever they need to to get by, whether
1894560	1898960	this means faking, making a meal from scratch, or holding their tongue when they have certain
1898960	1903600	thoughts. More than anything, this reflects the changing gender roles for women in society in
1903600	1909280	the 1980s, and some of the anxiety men feel towards them. Ultimately, Cliff has a good marriage, but
1909280	1913360	he's still connected to an earlier day with assumptions about women being emotional and
1913360	1919040	temperamental, which makes his supposedly respect for women limited, still using stereotypes instead
1919040	1924320	of giving them space to be who they truly are. So while Cliff's behavior is an improvement,
1924320	1930080	it only seems that way compared to someone like Elvin. As Elvin and Sandra's relationship develops,
1930080	1934880	Elvin's more overt sexism slowly fades, though it seems less a product of Elvin learning how to be
1934960	1939360	a better partner for Sandra, and more like his sexism was a trade the show didn't want to deal
1939360	1943920	with anymore. There was an episode that tried to depict them coming to a greater understanding with
1943920	1949040	one another, but it honestly read more like Elvin learning how to manipulate Sandra rather than him
1949040	1953440	learning how to respect her more as a person. Elvin isn't the only character struggling to
1953440	1958320	come to terms with gender politics, though. We see some of it in Theo in the season 2 episode,
1958320	1963840	Theo and the Older Woman, when Theo develops a crush on Denise's friend, and he learns that she
1963840	1986640	has a boyfriend. Theo doesn't take it well. Cliff has some decent advice for him.
1993840	2012880	And the episode ends with Theo finding a potential new love interest,
2012880	2017600	and taking an interest in his mother's garden as part of his process learning to understand
2017600	2022720	women as more complex beings. I also appreciate how it reveals the attitudes men hold are often
2022720	2026880	the real obstacle to these relationships flourishing, as women have no interest,
2026880	2032000	nor should they, in reverting to their less active places in the world from the days of
2032000	2037120	Cliff's youth. From its beginnings, the Cosby Show had no qualms dealing with sensitive topics
2037120	2042480	surrounding gender discrimination, drugs, or other fare for more somber sitcom episodes,
2042480	2046640	though quite noticeably there was one topic it rarely addressed head-on, and that was racial
2046640	2050880	discrimination. In the earlier seasons, and throughout much of the series, race was very
2050880	2055440	much a background aesthetic. References to culture included black authors, musicians,
2055440	2059840	and other artists, and this was buttressed by the numerous episodes featuring guest appearances by
2059840	2064720	black artists. This could be seen in episodes such as Play It Again, Russell, where Cliff's father
2064720	2069280	overcomes some anxiety to play with a band he had been in years before, complete with a number of
2069280	2073920	prominent, mostly black musicians backing him up. Although steeped in black culture, the Cosby Show
2073920	2078720	had very little to say about racism of the day. In fact, most discussions surrounding racism and
2078720	2083840	prejudice were framed as artists' backs from history. In one example, we see Russell with his
2083840	2087600	old military friends telling stories about their time serving during World War II.
2103360	2107360	And perhaps most compellingly, we hear stories from Cliff, Claire, and their respective parents
2107360	2112400	about participating on the march on Washington as part of the Civil Rights Movement. The premise
2112400	2116960	for this episode is that Thea's paper on the march was given a bad grade, as it merely recited a group
2116960	2121440	of loose facts copied out of a book. His family offers him a different way to look at the events
2121440	2126160	of that day, telling their own personal stories and experiences of attending the march.
2137360	2157440	This was a really great episode, maybe my favorite of the first three seasons.
2157440	2160960	It not only provides an interesting look at history, it also highlights the stories of the
2160960	2165600	people who are part of it. History can sometimes be reduced to facts of events that took place,
2165680	2169840	but a big part of why we care about history is because it affected real people, and hearing
2169840	2174960	their first-hand stories and experiences gives life to those events. But much like other moments
2174960	2179920	discussing racial discrimination in the series, it presents this struggle for racial equality as
2179920	2186000	historic. Recent history, yes, but history nonetheless. It isn't connected to Theo's life,
2186000	2190160	but rather presented as artifacts from the lives of his parents and grandparents. The fact that
2190160	2194480	his parents were there should speak to how recent everything was, and give them an opportunity to
2194480	2198800	connect that to Theo's life in the present. But aside from the great Theo gets on his paper,
2198800	2204320	it wasn't connected to his life in a direct way. The episode on its own was lovely, but in the
2204320	2209200	context of the Cosby Show more broadly, it sticks out, one of the few episodes to meaningfully
2209200	2213840	discuss race in America, and if there had been others that looked at it contemporarily, it would
2213840	2218240	have been fine. But as one of the few outliers, it doesn't do the subject justice from the context
2218240	2223840	of a discussion in the 1980s. This series aired alongside movies such as Spike Lee's Do the Right
2223840	2228640	Thing and music from Public Enemy, so these discussions were certainly happening. The Cosby
2228640	2233760	Show simply chose not to participate in them. The Cosby Show of course didn't need to be doing deep
2233760	2239200	dives on racial dynamics in 1980s America, but by not saying anything, it tacitly endorsed something
2239200	2244000	else. It reinforced the idea of colorblindness. The depiction of race on the show was very much
2244000	2248400	a concern for Bill Cosby while working on the series, so much so that he brought in professor
2248400	2253520	of psychiatry Alvin F. Poussaint to consult on it. According to Dr. Poussaint, he provided feedback
2253520	2258000	on every script and how accurately he believed it reflected a realistic portrayal of a black
2258000	2264800	family. The trouble with the white writers was not so much they were racist. It was that they didn't
2264800	2271280	have the experience. They didn't know the context of what they were writing about. He also reflected
2271280	2275520	some very real concerns regarding representation of black performance of different skin tones and
2275520	2281360	hair types. The sun, Theo, and I saw three or four dates and they were all light-skinned,
2281360	2288640	straight-haired black women. I said, Bill, who's casting these people? Bill went to the casting
2288640	2294000	director and said, I want you to get some dates for Theo and I want them to be pretty.
2296320	2303680	That's all he said. And the casting director said, oh, pretty, light skin, straight hair.
2304560	2309760	The one that came to depictions of overt racism, Dr. Poussaint stood alongside Bill Cosby in removing
2309760	2315920	or downplaying them within the context of the show. Bill said, that's like kind of corny,
2315920	2320720	straight stuff. He said, let's just show that she's really smart and the white people,
2320720	2324880	white lawyers interviewing her are jerks. While later seasons would introduce some more
2324880	2329360	thoughtful considerations about race, the early seasons were very much concerned with avoiding
2329360	2333760	presenting scenes where the Huxtables were victims of any sort of racial discrimination.
2333760	2338400	The emphasis was squarely on presenting positive images of a black family and by that positive
2338400	2343040	example undermining racism within society. One limitation of that approach is described by
2343040	2348160	sociologist Stuart Hall when he wrote, the problem with the positive-negative strategy is that adding
2348160	2353440	positive images to the largely negative repertoire of the dominant regime of representation increases
2353440	2358080	the diversity of ways in which being black is represented but does not necessarily displace
2358080	2362720	the negative. The Cosby Show's early seasons effectively reinforce the concept of the binary
2362800	2368880	of good and bad black representation on television by becoming the good ones. This reflects the
2368880	2373520	conservative values of the show. Although it may very well be aware of systemic challenges that a
2373520	2378080	black family faces, it does little to suggest changing that system aside from working within
2378080	2382480	the system's framework to create a better life for one's self and one's family. It reinforces
2382480	2386960	the idea that the American dream is in reach for black families so long as they play by the rules.
2387600	2391840	This is reflected in a speech given by Theo in the first season where he's accepted an award
2391840	2401200	for Cliff. One aspect of black culture the Cosby Show emphasized was the importance of
2401200	2405920	historically black colleges, very much fitting in with Cosby's well-worn refrain of emphasizing
2405920	2410720	education. It became a major plot point for Denise, particularly when it came to discussions
2410720	2415600	surrounding which post-secondary school she would attend. Cliff and his father very much
2415600	2432800	want Denise to attend Hillman, their alma mater. Eventually by the end of season two in the episode
2432800	2438160	Denise's decision Denise decides that she will attend Hillman. This school had everything that
2438160	2445120	I wanted and it also produced some very special people who went on to do great things including
2445120	2454880	having me. Denise goes off to school in season three though she still makes regular appearances
2454880	2459040	on the show as part of the cast. We even have an episode that sees the Huxtable family attend a
2459040	2463840	ceremony honoring the retirement of Hillman's president. This episode marked the end of one
2463840	2468240	era of the Cosby Show bringing with it a whole new world in the shape of a spin-off.
2468240	2478880	Starting in season four Lisa Bonet left the Cosby Show and would star a spin-off series titled
2478880	2483840	A Different World which had a backdoor pilot in the finale to the season three episode titled
2483840	2489040	Hillman. It would be set at a fictional historical black college following the trials of Denise
2489040	2493600	Huxtable trying to achieve a higher education. This was not the first time a backdoor pilot
2493600	2498880	appeared on the Cosby Show. In season one the episode Mr. Quiet served as a backdoor pilot for
2498880	2503280	a series starring Tony Orlando about a community center though it didn't quite capture enough
2503280	2508560	attention to become a series. On the other hand A Different World which was created by Bill Cosby
2508560	2513440	made a huge splash reaching number two in the ratings in its first season following its lead-in
2513440	2518480	program which was naturally the Cosby Show. The school has been identified as being modeled on
2518480	2524160	the historically black colleges Howard, Hampton, Spellman, and Morehouse. The last two most likely
2524160	2528560	because exterior shots of the school were done at Spellman and Morehouse. A Different World using
2528560	2533600	the comfortable lead of Denise Huxtable introduced audiences to a cast with more diverse backgrounds
2533600	2537920	than what they were seeing on the Cosby Show whereas the Huxtables lived a comfortable middle
2537920	2542320	class life with standard sitcom concerns. A Different World had black students from across
2542320	2546720	America representing a number of different experiences many of them evolving over the
2546720	2552320	years to become thoughtful, insightful portrayals. Denise was joined by her two roommates Jaleesa
2552320	2558320	played by Don Lewis and Maggie played by Marisa Tomei. Mary Alice as Letitia and Loretta Divine
2558320	2563040	as Stevie took turns as the dorm directors in the first season and the final two members of the first
2563040	2568640	season's principal cast were the oh so memorable pair of Whitley played by Jasmine Guy and Dwayne
2568640	2573200	played by Kadeem Hardison. A Different World is probably most fondly remembered for its life after
2573360	2577360	its first season though when Lisa Bonet exited the series and the show was put in the hands of Debbie
2577360	2582800	Allen, an alumna of Howard University and the real-life sister of Felicia Rashad. Darryl Bell and
2582800	2588320	Sinbad were promoted from reoccurring roles to the principal cast where they were joined by newcomers
2588320	2594400	Sharnell Brown, Kree Summer, Glenn Terman, and Lou Myers and perhaps most importantly the characters
2594400	2599360	Whitley and Dwayne were placed front and center with their romantic subplot being a major drive
2599360	2603040	in the series throughout the rest of its run. A Different World was lauded for being all the
2603040	2608240	things the Cosby Show wasn't. It provided a voice to a variety of black experiences in America and
2608240	2612880	didn't shy away for controversial issues such as homelessness, date rape, and was one of the first
2612880	2617760	TV shows to touch on the growing AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. It was also credited with raising
2617760	2622960	interest in historically black colleges. The series also broke stereotypes with Whitley probably being
2622960	2628000	the first southern bell portrayed by a black actress and Dwayne Wayne, a name so cool you have
2628080	2633600	to say the whole thing, being a hip guy who also happens to be a math whiz many years before the
2633600	2638800	geek chic thing became a trend. Not completely cut off from its spin-off roots, The Huxstables made
2638800	2643840	several guest appearances on the show, even after Lisa Bonet departed the series. Every member of
2643840	2649120	The Huxstable family made at least two appearances, albeit mostly in the first season. Though Felicia
2649120	2654480	Rashad, who appeared in four episodes, showed up in season two or later, Lisa Bonet even made a
2654480	2658800	brief return to the show for one episode in season three. Ahead of a different world's premiere,
2658800	2663600	Lisa Bonet's entry into the series did not seem entirely voluntary. In an interview with David
2663600	2668000	Letterman, she explained how she ended up on the show. And you're also getting your own,
2668000	2672240	you have your own pilot being spun off this Cosby thing. Yeah. Now, what is that about? Why would
2672240	2679600	you want to do that? Because they told me to. Although Bonet has not gone into detail about
2679600	2683760	her time on the show, reports from those who worked on the Cosby Show cited difficulties between her
2683760	2688560	and Bill Cosby, with her constantly resisting Cosby's need to control each part of the series.
2688560	2692800	Bonet's departure from a different world was largely driven by her pregnancy. Debbie Allen
2692800	2696880	wanted to keep Denise as a character on the show, thinking a single mother would introduce a fresh
2696880	2706000	dynamic. But Bill Cosby thought otherwise. He says, you know what, Debbie? No. She's pregnant.
2706000	2713120	Denise Huxstable is not pregnant. Lisa Bonet is pregnant, not Denise. So no, no, you can't have
2713200	2718720	it. No, we're not going to do it. No. So he took her back. I was so mad at him. I wanted to take
2718720	2723280	her, but I understood he just wanted her back. Lisa Bonet would remain a recurring star on the
2723280	2727760	Cosby Show on season five and would resume her full time status in season six.
2733520	2738320	Sandra and Elvin began season four as newlyweds, having announced their engagement in season three
2738320	2742320	and having been married in between the seasons. Although seemingly following in the footsteps of
2742400	2746640	Cliff and Claire, with Elvin going to med school and Sandra going to law school, the two instead
2746640	2752320	decide to drop out of school and open a wilderness store, which is, as best I could tell, a store to
2752320	2756720	buy camping supplies at. The couple decides to rent their first home together, and it similarly
2756720	2762640	does not inspire confidence in the Huxstable parents. Well, what do you think? So this is it.
2763280	2769600	Dad? It's an apartment, all right. Mom, dad, have a seat. Make yourselves at home. Thank you.
2769600	2770880	Thank you very much.
2778320	2781840	The couple go from grad students to working class in the blink of an eye,
2781840	2786480	though what seems like a fun new premise is short-lived, as by the time season five rolls around
2786480	2790480	and Elvin and Sandra have their first two children, Elvin reconsiders his decision to
2790480	2794000	leave medical school. They looked at them and they looked at me and I looked at her.
2794000	2804640	And then it came to me. I made a decision. Mom, dad, everybody. I'm going back to medical school.
2808480	2812240	And although Sandra doesn't have a similar scene, she eventually decides to go back to law school
2812240	2817440	as well. As a side note, the twins are named Winnie and Nelson, and while it's not explicitly
2817440	2821040	mentioned in the show, the names are of the bandellas who were in the middle of the battle
2821040	2826080	against apartheid in South Africa. This wasn't the only subtle show of solidarity, as Bill Cosby
2826080	2831040	apparently had to fight with the network for a sticker that read abolish apartheid to appear on
2831040	2835840	the door of Theo's bedroom. Season five opened with the episode together again and again,
2835840	2839600	with Denise returning from college for the summer and then eventually revealing she was
2839600	2844640	planning to drop out. What are you worried about? You're going back to him. No, I'm not. Yeah,
2844640	2850960	get serious. I am. I'm dropping out of school. What? With no major prospects on the horizon,
2850960	2855520	Denise moves back home with her parents. In the same episode, Theo, who is beginning his first
2855520	2859840	year at NYU, reveals that he forgot to mail the check for his dorm room, meaning he'll need a
2859840	2867680	place to stay. I said to you, son, don't forget to mail this. And you said no problem. And I went
2867680	2877360	right out and mailed it. I'm almost positive. And of course, this means one more Huxtable
2877360	2885600	Kid staying at home. It is believable that this boy deliberately did not mail that envelope so
2885600	2891280	that when he went down, there were no rooms that he would have to come back here and live. It is
2891280	2897360	believable that Denise does not want to go to college anymore because she wants to live here.
2897360	2905840	It is believable that this young man and this woman living in a condemned place on purpose
2907120	2913520	have this baby to make us feel sorry for them so they can come back here. In all three of these
2913520	2918000	cases, the Huxtable Kids are portrayed as having their lives in a bit of a mess. Something that
2918000	2922080	seems surprising when compared to how the early seasons seem to suggest that Cliff and Claire
2922080	2926160	were setting up their children for success. All those heart-to-heart talks encouraging them to
2926160	2930400	work hard, set goals for themselves, and plan for the future blow up the second they enter the real
2930400	2934400	world. And what ultimately keeps things from spiraling out of control for them is that they
2934400	2939920	have parents to bail them out. Not with words of wisdom, but with material support. Sondra and
2939920	2944800	Elvin get a loan for their apartment, while Denise and Theo get room and board. None of this, of
2944800	2949520	course, should be seen as condemning the Huxtables, but it does highlight a very important part of the
2949520	2953920	equation when it comes to their success in parenting. Growing up means making mistakes,
2953920	2958240	and sometimes those mistakes can have very real costs. The crucial difference here is that the
2958240	2962320	Huxtables can afford it when their kids make mistakes. One of the stated goals of the series
2962320	2967120	was to provide a positive example of parenting for families, but this positive example requires a
2967120	2972080	degree of material comfort that isn't realistic for a lot of families. Even before the Huxtable
2972080	2976800	Kids made mistakes, they still had their education paid for, a stable home, and were never in serious
2976800	2982080	want of anything. It's the sort of life any kid should have, but sadly many don't. If the early
2982080	2985920	seasons were presenting the Huxtable Kids in a bubble, no serious peril could ever pierce,
2985920	2990480	these seasons show the kids growing up into a more hostile world, but with the safety net of parents
2990480	2995200	who are able to provide material assistance. Denise exits the show for a second time in the
2995200	3000400	season 5 episode out of Brooklyn, where she gets a job alongside a photojournalist taking her to
3000400	3005120	Africa. Oh, I am so excited. You guys, don't worry about me. I'm gonna be fine. I know where I'm
3005120	3010560	going is gonna be difficult and rugged, but the most difficult part is gonna be being away from
3010560	3015120	you guys. I have always loved the sitcom trope of sending a character to the other side of the
3015120	3019680	world to explain why we don't see them for the next 21 episodes of the season. It can't be
3019680	3024400	understated how important Claire Huxtable is to the family dynamic. Cliff's antics tend to get
3024400	3029280	a lot of screen time, with Cosby making such a meal of his lines that it drifts into parody.
3029280	3036080	I shall lead with the queen of going to the garden and get the spain.
3036080	3044480	Felish Rashad takes control of scenes in a more quiet and controlled way. The show seems very
3044480	3049920	cognizant of the angry black woman trope, where black women are portrayed as being overly sassy
3049920	3055360	and ill-tempered as some kind of innate quality. Claire's character completely rejects that trope
3055360	3061120	by always being the calm voice of reason in most situations. In the season 5 episode, Mrs. Huxtable
3061120	3065840	goes to kindergarten, Claire is invited to join a Saturday morning TV show panel in which current
3065920	3070400	events are discussed. Her fellow panelists are taken aback at how capable she is in holding her
3070400	3074400	own in the heated debate. The Depression was still ravaging the nation when the stock market
3074400	3080000	began to recover. In my opinion, the crash was a precipitating event. That is the most ridiculous
3080000	3086080	thing I ever heard. I wouldn't call her opinion ridiculous, a bit naive. My opinion is neither
3086080	3090480	naive nor ridiculous in how the Sam Hill you expect to have a discussion if all points of
3090480	3096320	view are not taken into consideration. And we see a rare, and possibly only example of someone in
3096320	3102320	the Huxtable household facing racism. We're trying to broaden our viewership. Fine, then let her speak
3102320	3108080	when we get to the black topics. Excuse me, the black topics. Is that what I'm here to do,
3108080	3114000	talk about the black topics? No, you're also here to speak for women. Oh, that's nice. I am a woman
3114000	3119280	who is black, but I'm also a human being who is an attorney, a mother of five, and somewhat knowledgeable
3119280	3123360	about history, which is why I thought I was invited here. In that moment, Claire is reduced
3123360	3128080	to her identity in a way that invalidates her individual experiences, and her response,
3128080	3133280	instead of becoming indignant, is to hold herself to her own standard of behavior. I'm afraid we
3133280	3138560	only have 30 seconds left. In that time, could you please tell us what effect the Depression had on
3138560	3147200	the blacks? You want me to sum that up in 30 seconds. We learned that misery does not love
3147200	3151520	company. Another great part about this episode is how Cliff watched all of this happening in the
3151520	3156080	green room, confident that his wife could handle herself through the experience. She eventually
3156080	3160640	leaves the show in spite of efforts from the producers to keep her. Getting up at 4 30 in the
3160640	3165280	morning to prove who I am to three men who are basking in the non-existent rays of their own
3165280	3170720	intelligence is not my idea of a fun time. What was interesting about this episode is that it
3170720	3175440	showed a type of casual racism, and it does so among an educated class of people you might have
3175440	3180480	assumed knew better. And it stretches across the political spectrum, with the panelists being both
3180480	3186160	from the right and left. But perhaps most striking is how Claire can somehow rise above that. Her
3186160	3190400	behavior isn't surprising. She's behaving the way you would have expected her to having watched her
3190400	3194880	for over four seasons, but it flies in the face of a caricature she could have become. And one of
3194880	3198800	the few times we see Claire get upset, it's rare enough that it can be accepted as her just being
3198800	3201520	fed up with her kids in an exceptional moment.
3201600	3205600	Son, this is a wilderness. Denise is in the jungle, and she's on the locomotion.
3208640	3212560	Before the mothers come in here and see me, they'll be blaming me. Yeah,
3212560	3217120	running around here dressed in nothing, jumping around like they just hopped off the hot seat.
3217120	3222320	Suppose some fool comes along, sees that, takes them seriously. Vanessa could end up on a stage
3222320	3227120	somewhere across the country cliff in a smoked field cafe, singing and dancing and gyrating
3227120	3231040	like that. And I won't be around to take the tissues out then. I'm not.
3231040	3235680	Claire's outrage in that moment doesn't set the character back, because we know this isn't
3235680	3240160	something she usually does. And even this rare display of anger still feels like a part of the
3240160	3245280	character. And part of why it does is because Claire always feels authentic. In the episode
3245280	3249520	Birthday Blues, we get a taste of that as Claire deals with her kids thinking she'll be far more
3249520	3255200	fragile than she is on her 46th birthday. Mom, I apologize for your daughter's insensitivity. I
3255200	3259280	asked them not to bring up your age because I knew it would be rough on you. But it's not
3259280	3264240	rough for me. I love being 46. I think it's a lovely age. So do I. You look good for your age.
3266480	3272640	Thank you. No, I mean it. You really look good. Yeah, Mom, you really look good. Really?
3274400	3281920	Thank you. And Cliff's behavior isn't much better. You still look good. Now, why did you use that
3281920	3287520	word still? You didn't use to talk like that. You used to say, Claire, you look good. Am I not
3287520	3294000	supposed to look good? You're absolutely correct. The word still is out. You look good.
3295440	3299840	The fixation on Claire's appearance seems to annoy her more than whether or not she still has it at
3299840	3304240	46. Part of that confidence may come from her knowing she still has it, but more importantly,
3304240	3308400	she just seems so at ease with who she is. It projects a confidence in herself that makes
3308400	3313440	everything she does seem so real. Even if it sometimes makes Claire seem almost superhuman
3313440	3317600	with how she walks through her life, she's just flawed enough to be a vision of what it might be
3317600	3328000	to succeed in the world. Season 6 brought with it some major changes to the show with its premiere,
3328000	3332960	Denise, The Saga Continues. It featured the return of Lisa Bonet to the principal cast,
3332960	3337280	and she brought two new members with her. The first is Joseph C. Phillips, playing Denise's
3337360	3352800	new husband, Martin. The second is three-year-old Raven Simone, who played Denise's new stepdaughter,
3352800	3356960	Olivia. Olivia, honey, this is the house where Denise grew up.
3356960	3370480	The Huxtables are completely unaware of Denise's recent nuptials, and are even less ready for this
3370480	3375040	new family to move into their home. But once again, the Huxtable household is filled with life,
3375040	3378880	introducing some new storyline potential. You might have assumed this new dynamic would give
3378880	3384160	Lisa Bonet some new storylines, but Denise's character seems unfocused and inconsistent,
3384160	3388800	not just in her exploits, but the show doesn't seem to know what to do with her character at
3388800	3392960	this point. If anything, these new additions actually open the door for Raven Simone to
3392960	3396720	really shine, as Olivia soon becomes one of the most prominent members of the cast.
3414160	3418800	Lisa Bonet would depart from the show part of the way through season 7, and would not return at all
3418800	3423920	for season 8. Phillips would lead the principal cast in season 7 as well, but did still appear
3423920	3428720	as a guest star in one season 8 episode. Olivia, however, would be a big part of the series right
3428720	3433680	up to its final episode. The in-show reason for Olivia's parents' departure was explained as Martin
3433680	3438400	being stationed in various parts of East Asia and Denise wanting to be with him. They decided Olivia
3438400	3442960	would be best off stage with the Huxtables. The one season 8 episode that Phillips returned to
3442960	3446800	perform in allowed Martin to have an interesting episode with his daughter.
3472960	3479920	Martin's departure in that final appearance was a good episode about a family being something
3479920	3484160	more than your immediate relations, and it's one of the few episodes using Olivia that resonated
3484160	3488720	beyond what we had already seen, with Cliff playing with other children. Lisa Bonet's return
3488720	3492640	and eventual final departure made some news at the time, but another controversy that hit the
3492640	3497440	series during this period was about the opening credits for season 7. Each season of the Cosby
3497440	3502320	show quite noticeably used unique credit sequences for each season, each featuring the cast dancing
3502320	3506960	to a different version of his opening theme, Kiss Me. Depending on which opening you were seeing or
3506960	3511760	hearing, you could tell which season was airing. Originally, season 7 opened with the cast dancing
3511760	3517040	in front of a mural inspired by another mural titled Straight of Dreams, painted by inner city
3517040	3522960	kids from the Creative Arts Workshop in Harlem. The workshop director, Brookie Maxwell, argued that
3522960	3527600	the kids should get credit for the mural and, in response, Cosby pulled the intro for season 7
3528320	3533040	instead using a slightly altered version of the season 6 opening. Eventually, a compromise was
3533040	3538240	reached regarding use of the mural, and the intro for season 7 was used for season 8, with credit
3538240	3544320	going to 63 young artists in the show's closing credits. In earlier seasons of the Cosby show,
3544320	3548720	much of the episodes about Vanessa focused on her dating life and escapades with her friends.
3548720	3553200	Most of these episodes were pretty tame, and pretty standard stuff for a sitcom. For example,
3553280	3558240	in season 5's Truth or Consequences, we see Vanessa nearly have sex with her boyfriend at the time,
3558240	3562960	Jeremy. Jeremy comes off as a bit of a creep, clearly trying to manipulate Vanessa, but she
3562960	3566960	stands up for herself thanks to her parents instilling her with good values, and all is well
3566960	3571920	in the huckstable world. In other words, a typical episode. By the time the seventh season rolled
3571920	3576240	around, Bledsoe's role on the show was reduced. The in-show reason was that Vanessa had excelled
3576240	3580800	in school so much she was skipped four years so she could attend college. The real-world version
3580800	3584960	was similar in that Tempest Bledsoe wanted to attend college, and with some encouragement
3584960	3588720	from Bill Cosby, arrangements were made so she could attend full-time while still being a part
3588720	3592880	of the show. Bledsoe's accommodation seems to be one of the few that was given enthusiastically
3592880	3597200	by Cosby, likely due to the emphasis he had always placed on kids getting an education.
3597200	3601680	Although Bledsoe was still attending NYU's Stern School of Business, Vanessa made a surprising
3601680	3607360	return in season 8 with a new character in tow, her fiancé played by William Thomas Jr. with the
3607440	3610240	unforgettable name of Dabness Brickie.
3627760	3631760	The sudden engagement kept secret for six months, and the two of them only having known
3631760	3636560	each other for a year is made even more surprising when we learn that the 18-year-old Vanessa
3636560	3648720	is planning to marry a 30-year-old Dabness. We learn some other stuff about Dabness,
3648720	3652640	such as having served in the military and being the head of maintenance at the College Vanessa
3652640	3657360	is attending. The approval of the Huxtables isn't easily won by Dabness, and there's this
3657360	3661920	undercurrent of snobbery whenever his financial status is brought up. Although Cliff and Claire
3661920	3664000	insist they aren't bothered by his job.
3691920	3699680	The Huxtables are concerned that Vanessa isn't ready for marriage,
3699680	3704560	which we do eventually learn is true, but when Claire says she was concerned that Vanessa kept
3704560	3709440	Dabness a secret, she pivots away from Vanessa's explanation that she thought her parents would
3709440	3715840	judge him by his job by simply saying that it's lame. It raises the issue that, for six months,
3715840	3720080	Vanessa never felt comfortable mentioning she had a new boyfriend who happened to be a maintenance
3720080	3725120	man. And while the Huxtables can claim it doesn't bother them, Dabness's job and his perceived lack
3725120	3730000	of wealth is still used as a punchline. Here's how some of the family reacts to Vanessa's engagement
3730000	3757360	ring. I felt so bad for Dabness in that moment.
3757360	3762320	He isn't a lawyer or a doctor, and maybe he didn't have wealthy parents to pay his way through
3762320	3767360	school, but the way his job is used as a punchline undercuts whatever Cliff or Claire might say about
3767360	3772240	not judging him based on that. We eventually see Cliff soften to Dabness, but only when he finds
3772240	3796640	out he has his own house. Eventually, Dabness wins over the entire family, largely on account
3796640	3801360	of being a decent guy who happens to be handy around the house. The wedding never comes to
3801360	3806480	pass, as the engagement is eventually called off when Vanessa refuses to set a date. And we have
3806480	3822160	this cute little moment where Dabness unloads to Cliff. Dabness does show up for the series finale,
3822160	3826480	leaving the door open for him and Vanessa getting back together, but we never get closure on this
3826560	3832000	romance. What's frustrating about this plotline is how little we get a sense of what Vanessa wants.
3832000	3836400	The anxiety over how Vanessa thinks her parents will react takes some of the earlier episodes,
3836400	3840480	where the opinions of the Huxtables are presented as a guidepost to good behavior,
3840480	3845200	and we see how the shadow of those expectations leave Vanessa to react impulsively. This makes
3845200	3849760	season 8 a bit more interesting, as it's one of the rare instances where the parental advice
3849760	3855040	actually backfires. It shows some drawbacks to the Huxtable method, and makes the whole family
3855040	3860240	seem a little more flawed and relatable as a result. In earlier seasons, a Rudy-centric episode
3860240	3864480	would typically be about something very low stakes, such as the season 4 episode, It Ain't
3864480	3868480	Easy Being Green, where Rudy insists on wearing summer clothes to a fall party.
3885520	3889600	Cliff resolves this with a compromise, letting Rudy choose her clothes out of a selection of
3889600	3903760	fall clothing. Although stakes of this episode work really well, because Rudy is eight,
3903760	3907120	and something so small as not choosing her clothes would seem like a big deal to her,
3907120	3912240	and the resolution, letting Rudy have slightly more control over her life, is sensible and sweet.
3912240	3917200	In later seasons though, Rudy's storylines began to evolve. We see Rudy becoming a stronger,
3917200	3922160	more assertive character, and what makes that readily apparent in later seasons is thanks to,
3922160	3928320	in no small part, the introduction of her friend Kenny, also known as Bud, played by Dion Richmond.
3942720	3950080	Third Dynamic is initially just for cute moments where Rudy has to assert her strong personality
3950080	3952080	after Kenny says something incredibly stupid.
3972240	3988000	They're cute little moments, but they evolve into something so much more. Most of the
3988000	3992240	interactions the hostable kids have with the opposite gender are usually done in the context
3992240	3996880	of dating. This is partially true of Rudy in later seasons, as we see her start to enter the dating
4027040	4032960	world, but Rudy and Kenny's relationship takes a different path. Although them becoming a couple
4032960	4038160	is teased at in the earlier seasons, by the time season 8 rolls around, we see Rudy instead dating
4038160	4043520	a new character, Stanley, played by Merlin Santana. Kenny takes exception to the new couple,
4043520	4045680	and does whatever he can to undermine them.
4056880	4066000	Kenny goes so far as to fake having a girlfriend in an effort to make Rudy jealous,
4066000	4069360	though eventually an important lesson about friendship is learned.
4086880	4094080	He's just that he's always there. Sorry I acted like a jerk to him.
4094080	4098080	That's okay, I acted like one too. So what happened to Deidre?
4098640	4101360	I walked her home. Said she got me tomorrow if I called her.
4101360	4102560	Are you gonna call her?
4102560	4103360	Oh yeah.
4104480	4106480	Guess you're gonna have to call somebody sometime.
4107200	4109760	Yeah, now you and I have something coming again.
4109760	4111200	Well, I'm happy for you.
4111200	4114720	I'm happy for me too. I'm happy for you.
4115440	4118640	So does this mean you won't be tagging along with me and Stanley anymore?
4118640	4119600	Well, I'll be tagging.
4121120	4122720	I'll just have Deidre with me.
4122720	4123200	We'll double.
4125040	4128240	I really like how this friendship blossomed between Rudy and Kenny.
4128240	4132640	Girls and boys should be able to be friends, even with the messiness of a one-sided attraction.
4132640	4135760	How you see someone one day isn't how you'll see them for the rest of your life,
4135760	4140080	and learning how to grow past someone who isn't interested is a great sign of maturity and growth.
4140080	4144880	Being able to do this at 13 seems like a stretch, especially considering the attitudes towards
4144880	4148160	women Kenny was carrying with him, but it's still a positive message.
4148160	4152880	In the 90s, a decade this show was just entering, there was still a lot of confusion about the way
4152880	4156640	evolving gender dynamics would influence relationships, and Kenny's advice on his
4156640	4159840	brother representing an older, easier way of looking at them.
4159840	4164640	The Cosby Show uses the strength of Rudy as a female character to challenge these assumptions,
4164640	4168000	and create a new script that lets everyone find some happiness,
4168000	4170640	and not have the world warp to fit the desires of Kenny.
4170640	4175120	It also means Rudy didn't have to choose between dating someone she likes and keeping one of our
4175120	4175840	oldest friends.
4176640	4181520	As the Cosby Show reached its seventh season, it was starting to show signs of waning popularity.
4181520	4185920	ABC's Roseanne was gradually gaining ground, and the Cosby Show's dominance on Thursday nights
4185920	4190000	was about to be challenged by a serious contender, The Simpsons, on Fox.
4190000	4194480	Season 7's premiere was one of the only episodes of the Cosby Show to begin with a cold opening,
4194480	4196720	acknowledging the series' new rival.
4196720	4201040	In the first weeks of competition, there was much discussion about The Simpsons beating the
4201040	4202480	Cosby Show in key markets.
4202480	4206640	However, by the end of the year, The Cosby Show would still finish well ahead of The Simpsons.
4206640	4210480	Even with The Cosby Show holding onto the crown of its Thursday night time slot,
4210480	4212480	it still had a fall in the overall ratings.
4212480	4216640	Breaking its streak of five consecutive years as the number one show in the United States,
4216640	4221920	it would finish its seventh season as the fifth most watched show, and by its eighth season,
4221920	4226320	it would fall to 18th, right behind its own spin-off, A Different World.
4226400	4230160	The new challenge to its dominance hadn't been ignored, though, and The Cosby Show made a big
4230160	4232880	addition in its seventh season to keep people interested.
4232880	4239440	It introduced a new member to the family, Claire's cousin, Pam Tucker, played by Erika Alexander.
4240000	4243440	Pam grew up in a single-parent household, and she joined the Huxtables when her mother
4243440	4247440	was forced to leave New York to take care of Pam's grandmother in California.
4247440	4249920	Pam stayed behind to finish her high school education,
4249920	4253280	and the Huxtables offered to take her in so she'd have a place to stay.
4253280	4256640	Pam's background of being working class brought a new dynamic to the show,
4256640	4260480	a regular cast member who led a very non-Hux-table kind of life.
4260480	4264400	Pam appeared alongside some friends, Karen Molina White as Charmaine,
4264400	4269200	Alan Payne as Lance, and Michonne Lee as Slide, Pam's boyfriend.
4269200	4273120	The impression these teens have of the Huxtable home reveals the class dynamics at play.
4283280	4310400	But a few words from the Huxtables settle everyone down.
4313280	4336080	And very quickly, we get a sense of what this show's new dynamic will be like.
4336080	4340320	Pam is coming from a poorer neighborhood, but it isn't just the wealth that's going to change
4340400	4343520	her life, it's the strong influence of the Huxtables themselves.
4344080	4348400	One thing I appreciated about Pam's appearance is that there's no judgment about her family,
4348400	4351280	such as lines about her mother being an unfit parent.
4351280	4355600	All we see is an acknowledgement about that her life has certainly been a tougher one.
4355600	4359680	Pam's storylines often felt very different than the ones impacting the Huxtable kids.
4359680	4362480	For example, we had seen Vanessa being pressured into having sex,
4362480	4367920	but it didn't compare to the pressure Pam faced in Season 7 in the two-parter just thinking about it.
4370320	4377320	Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,
4377320	4386320	Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,
4386320	4393320	Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,
4393320	4398320	Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,
4398320	4401320	Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, answering, answering, answering, answering, answering, answering, answering, answering.
4401320	4405320	Although Pam and Sly get back together, it wouldn't last
4405320	4407480	and they would eventually break up for good.
4407480	4411320	Pam would soon be dated a new character named Aaron, played by Seth Gilliam.
4411320	4414600	Do you speak French? I do a little, actually a lot.
4414600	4416800	Not because I am smart, I just studied it in school.
4416800	4418240	Anybody can do that, it's not like I'm the smartest guy in class.
4418240	4420360	You're not? No.
4420360	4424320	There are at least... 4 other people smarter than me. Well, maybe 3.
4424320	4427600	Pam's new love interest more closely resembles the world of the Huxtables.
4427600	4432920	It symbolizes how Pam is changing in the series, taking on the characteristics of her new household.
4433200	4438840	Although there's no judgment of Pam or her background, the show makes the subtle argument that, for Pam to be happy,
4438840	4440840	she needs to live more like the Huxtables.
4441040	4446200	We see this in her academic life as she goes from being indifferent to school to working hard to get better grades.
4454600	4457440	You know when I first came here, you people didn't look all that good to me.
4457600	4464600	But you welcomed me, made me feel at home, gave me curfew.
4464600	4470600	Just in case I do decide to go to college, I'm studying.
4470600	4474600	But Pam might not be able to afford to go to college after all.
4474600	4479600	Well, dear, if she's gonna go to college, how's she gonna pay for it?
4479600	4481600	Oh, that's the least of her worries.
4481600	4483600	Oh, I beg your pardon?
4484600	4486600	That'd be silly. She'll work.
4486600	4487600	She's gonna work.
4487600	4490600	She can work like I did. She can work in the post office like I did.
4490600	4494600	Dear, you worked in the post office during the Christmas holidays.
4494600	4498600	The episode's final moments make us sit with that question, watching Pam get down to study.
4498600	4500600	But to what end?
4500600	4504600	Claire seemed strangely ambivalent, as if things will just work out for Pam.
4504600	4506600	But how will that happen?
4506600	4512600	How will she take advantage of this opportunity of a stable home life letting her study more, if she simply can't afford tuition?
4512600	4515600	Unfortunately, we never get a decent conclusion to this plotline.
4515600	4518600	In season 8, in the episode Pam Applies to College,
4518600	4522600	the idea of Pam not being able to afford to go to school is completely dropped,
4522600	4525600	and instead it becomes a case of her grades not being high enough,
4525600	4529600	with only one semester of solid work after having moved in with the Huxtables.
4529600	4532600	Pam, look, it takes more than one semester of work to get into college.
4532600	4534600	But I wanna go.
4534600	4537600	You know, all this time you people tell me go to college, go to college.
4537600	4540600	Now I wanna go to college and you people won't let me in.
4540600	4542600	But you people would make up your mind.
4543600	4546600	And this is more or less how it all gets wrapped up.
4546600	4551600	I suppose Pam starts working jobs to eventually afford college, but that's just a guess.
4551600	4554600	We don't get a better look of how things will turn out for her.
4554600	4560600	Unfortunately, the Cosby Show doesn't really give us an understanding of what life is like for someone who wants to go to college but can't afford it.
4560600	4564600	Although Pam was meant to give us a look at the world outside the Huxtable home,
4564600	4567600	it reveals how timid the show can be to really take a look at it.
4567600	4571600	It lets Pam exist in the Huxtable world, but doesn't do much to describe hers,
4571600	4576600	and if anything, she conforms to that new world more so than bringing a new perspective to it.
4577600	4583600	In the sixth season, it was revealed that Theo's lack of educational achievement was a product not of him having bad study habits,
4583600	4585600	but rather having dyslexia.
4585600	4588600	The night before the test, I knew I was gonna get an A.
4588600	4593600	Yeah, because you told me that you were gonna knock it out of the park.
4593600	4595600	And I got a C.
4595600	4597600	You guys, I'm sick of being stupid.
4597600	4599600	Ms. Roscoe gave me the test results back.
4599600	4600600	And?
4600600	4602600	What did she say?
4604600	4607600	You guys, I'm dyslexic.
4610600	4617600	This episode, Theo's gift, even writes a few wrongs when the Huxtables re-examine their own behaviors when it came to their parenting of Theo.
4617600	4624600	And to thank Theo, all those years you were doing lousy in school and dad called you lazy.
4624600	4626600	I know.
4627600	4629600	He has been pretty rough on me.
4629600	4633600	I don't think that this is the time for you to bring these things up.
4633600	4636600	Well, I don't blame you, Mom. You must feel just as bad.
4638600	4639600	Excuse me?
4639600	4645600	And with the appropriate techniques, Theo is able to work through his dyslexia and starts improving his academic performance.
4645600	4650600	As Theo's grades improve, he makes the Dean's List and starts setting himself up to go to grad school.
4650600	4657600	One of his interests is teaching, so we see him take a job at the local community center in a poorer community running an after-school program.
4657600	4663600	It's here where the Cosby Show once again tries to give the audience a broader look at the Black American experience.
4663600	4669600	We get a chance to meet Theo and his new supporting cast of young teens in Theo and the Kids, Part 1.
4669600	4675600	Where Theo quickly realizes watching over some kids at an after-school program is going to be tougher than he imagined.
4675600	4679600	Rosa! Rosa! Rosa! Rosa!
4679600	4681600	Hey! Hey! Hey!
4683600	4688600	Now I want everybody to sit down and shut up.
4690600	4698600	This is the episode where we first meet Stanley, Rudy's eventual love interest, and learn that, like Theo, he may also have dyslexia.
4698600	4704600	All my life, I felt like I was walking in the basement, and everybody had to lie to him but me.
4704600	4710600	See, I had a little flashlight. I could see a little bit of this, a little bit of that, but I could never see the whole room.
4710600	4714600	Stanley, you're walking through life with a flashlight, and you don't have to.
4715600	4725600	While a nice short story of Theo making a difference in one kid's life, what makes this two-parter interesting is Theo's attempt to connect to another student, named Rahim, played by Keenan Scott.
4725600	4727600	You want to talk about it, man?
4727600	4731600	What's the talk about? They laid off half my father's shift at the paper company.
4731600	4735600	I'm sorry to hear that, man. I mean, let's just hope it's temporary.
4735600	4739600	Yeah, I hope so, too. But in the meantime, I'm not going to be coming to the center.
4739600	4740600	Why not?
4740600	4746600	Because I'm the oldest. I got to make some money, so after school, I'm going to be delivering groceries at the supermarket.
4746600	4750600	After this week, I'm out of here. Peace, Mr. Huxtable.
4750600	4762600	Rahim's family's struggle with Bunny is something Theo can't fix on his own, and sadly, reflective of the problems a lot of Rahim's classmates face.
4780600	4783600	Rahim slams the bag down on the floor.
4784600	4794600	You know, every day, we get these lunches, these box lunches, with apples, carrots, sandwiches, milk, you know.
4794600	4803600	Now, this one girl, every day, she volunteers to go around and collect the garbage, and then she goes out in the hallway.
4803600	4807600	So, of course, I'm thinking she's separating the stuff for recycling.
4807600	4813600	Dad, she opened that backpack, and there was all this food.
4813600	4818600	And she told me that she takes the food home to feed her family.
4818600	4821600	Theo simply can't save all his students.
4821600	4823600	I'll save a seat for you.
4823600	4829600	Actually, I don't want that seat. I want to sit next to that girl, Cal. I think she likes me.
4829600	4831600	You got it.
4834600	4839600	This gives us another glimpse into the world outside the Huxtable home and the limitations of its approach.
4839600	4849600	It can make a positive difference, sending Theo out in the world to help a kid like Stanley, but for Rahim and many of his fellow students, Theo can't make the impact he wishes he could.
4849600	4852600	I appreciate the different challenges of these kids being brought up.
4852600	4859600	We're seeing class struggles and the limited impact of a good teacher, but it doesn't completely disregard the fact that a good teacher does make a difference.
4859600	4864600	Even if it isn't enough to change the world, it can at least provide some comfort and support for these kids.
4864600	4874600	This two-parter closed Season 7, and we saw more of Theo with these kids in Season 8, but unfortunately, it didn't go a heck of a lot deeper than what we saw in these episodes.
4874600	4878600	We do meet Rahim one more time in the Season 8 episode, Cliff and Theo Come Clean.
4878600	4888600	It's never explained how he got back into the after-school program, but his financial problems remain, as seen when he discovers some money and the kids have a debate over what should be done with it.
4888600	4901600	The money is eventually returned to its owner, but the episode luckily doesn't end with such a simple lesson.
4919600	4931600	But the people who need it most never get it. Other people get it. Like politicians, movie stars, ballplayers, preachers, they're all taking down big bucks.
4931600	4932600	Yeah, you're right.
4932600	4940600	But they're not all good people. Some do drugs, some steal it, some even lie all the time just to keep their money.
4940600	4942600	But what does it have to do with Rahim?
4942600	4947600	This Rahim? This Rahim should have kept his mouth shut and walked out of here with that money.
4949600	4952600	This Rahim is the last on his fool.
4952600	4965600	Theo lets Rahim know he would have done just the same, and so would his classmates, and it might have been enough to impress Letitia, one of Rahim's classmates, which seems to placate him, but does little to address the very real problems he brought up.
4965600	4974600	The episode states quite plainly that we shouldn't sacrifice our personal ethics in pursuit of a more just world, and it reflects one of the more depressing messages of the series.
4974600	4982600	Take care of yourselves, and eventually things will work. Or maybe they won't. But at least you won't be corrupted. You'll just be hungry.
4982600	4986600	One bright part in this subplot was seeing Theo grow as a character.
4986600	4992600	In season 8, he was both accepted into grad school and offered a high paying job with a major corporation.
4992600	5000600	He relished the chance to have options in his life, though he ultimately decided to pursue grad school so he can keep working with kids like Stanley and Rahim.
5000600	5012600	And this of course leads us to the series finale, titled, And So We Commence, a two parter about the Hoxtable family getting ready for Theo's graduation. It would air on April 30th, 1992.
5012600	5018600	The ending of The Cosby Show was a major event for NBC, with ads circulating widely promoting this finale.
5018600	5026600	You're invited to witness a special chapter in television history, an event people will be talking about for months to come. The final Cosby Show.
5026600	5037600	The episode itself, however, proved to be a bit tepid. Perhaps that made it more fitting for a series that was about small moments and simple plots, but for an ending to an eight year story, it felt a bit flat.
5037600	5043600	The plotline through this two parter was the tension over whether or not Theo would find enough tickets for his expansive family.
5043600	5053600	Eventually he does. And that pretty much sums up the finale's plot. There are some cute moments, such as a role reversal between Theo and Cliff.
5073600	5080600	And Cliff's reaction to the surprise return of Dabness is fun.
5080600	5082600	Hi, Daddy.
5082600	5089600	Dabness. Dabness. Dabness. Dabness. Dabness.
5089600	5090600	How are you, sir?
5090600	5092600	Hi, Dad.
5092600	5094600	Dabness.
5094600	5105600	Denise also makes an appearance, although Lisa Bonet certainly does not. Instead, we see a brief scene where everyone talks to Denise over the phone and we find out that she's pregnant.
5105600	5108600	What?
5109600	5110600	My baby.
5110600	5111600	What?
5111600	5113600	My baby's having a baby.
5115600	5122600	The plot for this two parter is so thin, we get a flashback to the first episode for six whole minutes.
5122600	5128600	As the series ends, Cliff and Claire dance together to celebrate another child successfully on their way.
5128600	5134600	The final line you can scarcely hear comes from Cliff, or maybe it's Bill at this point, saying,
5134600	5141600	Come on, let's go, as the two continue to make personal comments, fading into obscurity as they move towards the audience.
5141600	5146600	And with that, the Huxtables danced off into the sunset.
5146600	5150600	The final episode was more a celebration of the series rather than an ending.
5150600	5154600	It's clear that the Huxtables' lives will go on, whether there's a camera to capture them or not.
5154600	5156600	We just got a few years to watch the escapades.
5156600	5162600	The finale offers a small chance to reflect on the themes of the series, the value of good parenting, a proper education,
5162600	5165600	and the need for the financial means to make that happen.
5165600	5170600	Theo embodies the success of this philosophy, to make a better world in his immediate surroundings,
5170600	5173600	though perhaps not changing the wider world outside of that.
5173600	5176600	In many ways, it's a good metaphor for the Cosby Show itself.
5176600	5182600	It wasn't a series that tried to change television by rewriting the rules, so much as it tried to make itself a positive example.
5182600	5190600	And its example led to a new age of family-friendly sitcoms, one that felt safe and comfortable but didn't necessarily rock the boat.
5192600	5204600	The finale of the Cosby Show aired on April 30, 1992, which was the second day of what are commonly called the 1992 Los Angeles riots,
5204600	5208600	though some might prefer the name of the 1992 Los Angeles uprising.
5208600	5217600	These were precipitated by the brutal arrest and beating of Rodney King, in which four police officers beat King, unaware that they were being filmed at the time.
5217600	5220600	The footage sparked outrage, and the four officers were charged.
5220600	5226600	On April 29, they were acquitted of those charges, sparking unrest in the city.
5226600	5236600	Though live news coverage dominated the evening in Los Angeles, it was suspended for an hour to air the final episode of the Cosby Show, a decision made by the local NBC affiliate.
5236600	5242600	Today, Mayor Tom Bradley urged everyone in Los Angeles to remain home, to stay off the streets.
5242600	5252600	He also suggested they might want to watch the Cosby Show because he believes, and we believe, we need this time, a bit of a cooling off period, giving us some breathing space.
5252600	5258600	Maybe a time to remember what Thursday nights were like before all this madness began in Los Angeles.
5258600	5262600	The Rodney King video revealed a truth known in black communities for decades.
5262600	5268600	The police would often, with impunity, brutalize black men during arrest, something that still happens today.
5268600	5277600	There's something fitting about the Cosby Show, which was often accused of obscuring racism of the day, having its finale being used for the exact same purpose.
5277600	5281600	Cosby's own feelings about the situation were made clear in an interview.
5281600	5292600	It is very difficult to look at the King tape and feel that this is not excessive force, and obviously the people were waiting for some kind of reprimand, and when they got and saw nothing at all, the response came.
5293600	5298600	Now, how do you say these people are irresponsible without first committing responsibility to a verdict?
5298600	5300600	I don't understand.
5300600	5305600	However, when asked about the decision to air the episode in Los Angeles, Cosby said in an interview,
5322600	5325600	that for eight years had given people a good feeling about themselves.
5325600	5337600	It seems clear by these words that Bill Cosby never meant for his show to directly address the realities of discrimination black Americans faced in the modern day, at least not at a level of detail that could possibly hope to address something like police brutality.
5337600	5342600	The Cosby Show rarely mentioned race at all, and what it did often didn't include the central cast.
5342600	5344600	Here's a rare example from the series.
5352600	5367600	And none of the principal cast is even present in this scene.
5367600	5371600	It's a moment that happens, and just as easily moved on from.
5371600	5375600	The show just wasn't terribly interested in tackling the topic of racial discrimination.
5375600	5380600	It raises the question of what this show meant to the audience it was designed to uplift.
5380600	5383600	What were the reactions to the Cosby Show from black audiences?
5383600	5387600	One prominent criticism was an editorial published in the New York Times titled,
5387600	5393600	TV's Black World Turns But Stays Unreal, by literary scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.
5393600	5403600	While I applaud Cosby's success at depicting, at long last, the everyday concerns of black people, love, sex, ambition, generational conflicts, work and leisure,
5403600	5411600	far beyond reflex responses to white racism, the question remains, has TV managed to depict a truly different world?
5411600	5415600	Gates's writing reflects what many black critics of the show had observed,
5415600	5418600	and Cosby himself addressed some of those concerns in interviews.
5418600	5420600	In one 1989 interview he said,
5421600	5425600	I agree with critics who say it doesn't do enough, but the people who are viewing it are having a ball with it.
5425600	5429600	We get thank you letters from all over the US, Canada and Europe.
5429600	5431600	I know I've got to go a distance with it.
5431600	5437600	And in another interview expressed concern that if he highlighted racial conflict, it would make white viewers feel like they were the villain.
5437600	5442600	In 1995, Leslie B. Innes and Joe R. Fiegen published an article titled,
5442600	5447600	The Cosby Show, The View from the Black Middle Class, in the Journal of Black Studies.
5447600	5452600	The authors had over 100 members of the Black Middle Class describe their opinions on representations in media,
5452600	5455600	and the article highlighted the many thoughts related to The Cosby Show.
5455600	5458600	Here are a few examples of the responses they got.
5458600	5463600	I do know that this is just entertainment, but my kids think it's the way we should live.
5463600	5464600	That is unfair.
5464600	5472600	It is unfair for me to explain to my son that, no, mom is not a lawyer, dad is not a doctor, and these things don't work that way.
5472600	5474600	I think it's really sad.
5474600	5480600	I wish we had more shows like Cosby on TV, where you have a black doctor and the wife is a lawyer, because they do exist.
5480600	5486600	I mean, they're on a small scale, percentage-wise, but they do exist, and I think we take too many negatives and blow them up.
5486600	5493600	I have a problem with the fact that The Cosby Show will build a 30-minute episode around Heathcliff Huxtable building a hero sandwich.
5493600	5496600	Why aren't we dealing with some real issues that are confronting the Black Middle Class?
5496600	5503600	Yes, the kids go to NYU and other great universities like that, but what they come home talking about is what this racist professor said and did,
5503600	5506600	and I don't see that occurring on The Cosby Show.
5506600	5511600	As you can see by some of the responses highlighted, there is no overarching positive or negative trend in the comments.
5511600	5516600	The authors of the article observed that the overwhelming theme in the responses were how mixed they all were,
5516600	5519600	often reflecting on both positive and negative aspects of the program.
5519600	5526600	Considering these comments are about the most popular show in the country, it undermines the sort of enthusiasm you might expect for such a big hit.
5527600	5534600	It reveals to us that the show perhaps struck a stronger chord, not with the Black audiences it hoped to inspire, but the white audiences who found comfort in it.
5534600	5542600	The Cosby Show would be re-examined many times over the years, as more sitcoms starring Black families deviated from its squeaky-clean aesthetic.
5542600	5550600	But it was comments from a particular speech of Bill Cosby's that would once again offer the chance to reframe the show and the work Cosby had done throughout his career.
5551600	5553600	Get in somebody else's business.
5553600	5560600	On May 17, 2004, during an NAACP Legal Defense Fund award ceremony in Washington, D.C.,
5560600	5565600	commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision,
5565600	5570600	Bill Cosby gave a speech where he made some very pointed remarks about the Black community.
5570600	5574600	These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola.
5574600	5579600	People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake.
5580600	5583600	And then we all run out and wear outrage.
5583600	5585600	Oh, the cops shouldn't have shot him.
5585600	5588600	How was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?
5590600	5596600	Everybody knows it's important to speak English, except these knuckleheads.
5596600	5601600	You can't land a plane with why you ain't where or how to hunt it.
5601600	5606600	You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth.
5607600	5609600	The speech had a number of factual errors,
5609600	5612600	and I've included an article that rebuts many of its points below.
5612600	5616600	Perhaps the most famous response to the speech came from Michael Eric Dyson,
5616600	5621600	who wrote, is Bill Cosby right, or has the Black middle class lost his mind?
5621600	5625600	In an interview with NPR, Dyson gave a rundown of his critique of Cosby's speech.
5625600	5629600	The interview was preceded by remarks from Bill Cosby that clarified his infamous speech.
5629600	5633600	I'm looking at, in the lower economic area,
5633600	5639600	the 50 percent dropout of the African American male from high school.
5639600	5642600	And I'm realizing that there's a great deal of racism.
5642600	5645600	We take that. We all know that.
5645600	5651600	But then again, there's a time when we have to turn around the mirror and look at ourselves.
5651600	5655600	And in that NPR program, we get to hear Dyson's response to that.
5655600	5660600	The best of our Black leaders and intellectuals who have always remembered it's a both and,
5660600	5663600	even as you speak about personal responsibility,
5663600	5667600	you link that personal responsibility to its possibility of realization
5667600	5675600	in a culture that either enables you to do better or puts its foot on your neck and keeps you from rising.
5675600	5679600	And what's more, he explains the harm done by Bill Cosby by making these debates
5679600	5682600	happening within Black communities available to the broader public.
5682600	5686600	They get in on a conversation that's been going on for a long time among Black folk
5686600	5688600	who are speaking shorthand and they don't quite get it.
5688600	5692600	So now public policymakers who hear Mr. Cosby assaulting the poor
5692600	5695600	and saying that they are responsible begin to change their mind.
5695600	5700600	They say, well, we thought we had to help them because we had to indict our own social practices
5700600	5702600	for their failure to be able to assist these people.
5702600	5705600	Now, as Mr. Cosby is saying, they got to do it themselves.
5705600	5708600	So maybe we shouldn't put this extra money into this program.
5708600	5712600	Much of what Cosby had said in his speech could be seen in his work over the decades,
5712600	5713600	including the Cosby show.
5714600	5718600	In the season eight episode, For Men Only, we see what Cliff Huxtable's advice
5718600	5720600	to teen boys at a community center look like.
5744600	5750600	The message is, quite clearly, the only thing stopping these guys from making a future for themselves
5750600	5752600	is the decisions they make.
5752600	5754600	It's very conservative messaging.
5754600	5757600	You could almost imagine Huxtable handing out bootstraps.
5757600	5760600	And while it's not a bad message, personal responsibility is a good thing.
5760600	5765600	It doesn't address the additional challenges these guys will face trying to escape a life of poverty.
5765600	5769600	Cliff recommends a higher education, but how do they afford it?
5769600	5771600	And what burden will this place on their family?
5771600	5774600	And it's a bit galling to hear this from Cliff Huxtable,
5774600	5778600	because how many of his kids had to work an additional job to afford their tuition?
5778600	5780600	Even with the momentary backlash against the poundcake speech,
5780600	5783600	Bill Cosby's reputation was still healthy enough that,
5783600	5787600	by the time the 30th anniversary of the Cosby show rolled around in the fall of 2014,
5787600	5792600	there was a round of positive media coverage examining its longevity and success.
5792600	5798600	In some cases, articles hypothesize that the success of the Cosby show helped prepare America for its first black president.
5798600	5801600	Though Bill Cosby was still widely credited with being America's dad,
5801600	5804600	that image would be changed in late 2014,
5804600	5808600	when a story he likely thought buried once again returned to the surface.
5810600	5813600	The following section includes sexual assault.
5813600	5817600	If you would like to skip ahead, go to the timestamp below.
5817600	5823600	In 2004, Andrea Konstan, director of operations for the women's basketball team at Temple University,
5823600	5827600	claimed that Bill Cosby had given her pills that made her semi-unconscious and unable to move.
5828600	5832600	And while she was in that state, she alleged that Cosby sexually assaulted her.
5832600	5836600	In January of 2005, Konstan filed a criminal complaint.
5836600	5839600	Cosby claimed that the counter was consensual.
5839600	5841600	The case was eventually dropped by the prosecutor,
5841600	5844600	seeing it as a case of he said, she said.
5844600	5848600	But Konstan then filed a civil claim against Cosby in March of 2005,
5848600	5851600	alongside 13 women who offered to be witnesses,
5851600	5854600	making similar claims about Cosby's predatory behavior.
5854600	5859600	The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in November of 2006.
5859600	5863600	In June of 2006, Philadelphia Magazine published an article by Robert Huber titled,
5863600	5865600	Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde,
5865600	5870600	that began to pull back on the carefully crafted public persona that Cosby had made for himself.
5870600	5875600	Interspersed with this article are the stories of some of the women Cosby had assaulted,
5875600	5877600	revealing damning details.
5877600	5882600	The story of Cosby being a sexual predator did not capture public attention,
5882600	5885600	or at least it would not for another eight years,
5885600	5889600	when a clip from a stand-up performance by Hannibal Perez went viral in late 2014.
5889600	5892600	Suddenly, the media was all over the story,
5892600	5896600	and even more women started coming forward with similar accounts as to what happened to Konstan
5896600	5898600	and the other women who came forward.
5898600	5902600	In total, over 60 women came forward with accusations against Cosby,
5902600	5905600	ranging from sexual harassment to rape.
5905600	5907600	With mounting public pressure,
5907600	5913600	the lawyer for Konstan requested that the deposition made by Cosby in the 2005 case be unsealed.
5913600	5917600	The judge agreed, citing Cosby's role as a public moralist.
5917600	5923600	When the deposition was unsealed, it revealed that Cosby had admitted to giving women quaaludes before having sex with them.
5923600	5929600	According to Cosby, these encounters were consensual, though many of his 60-plus accusers dispute that.
5929600	5933600	The statute of limitations had expired on many of the claims his accusers had made,
5933600	5935600	so they couldn't be tested in court.
5935600	5939600	Only Konstan's accusations still existed within the statute of limitations,
5939600	5942600	and would eventually go to criminal court.
5942600	5947600	In December of 2015, Cosby was charged with three instances of aggravated indecent assault,
5947600	5951600	and in April of 2018, he would be found guilty on all three charges.
5951600	5954600	He was sentenced to three to ten years in state prison.
5954600	5958600	Cosby's castmates from the series have largely remained quiet about the situation,
5958600	5961600	though I did appreciate this comment from Joseph C. Phillips.
5962600	5966600	I think like a lot of people, I was really giving Bill the benefit of the doubt.
5966600	5970600	This was not the man that I knew. This is not the man that I worked with.
5970600	5976600	He may have had other faults, but he certainly was not drugging people and raping them.
5976600	5979600	And then I had a conversation with an old friend.
5979600	5982600	Bumped into her. I hadn't talked to her in a couple of years.
5984600	5988600	I just thought, hey, he used to be like your mentor or something.
5988600	5989600	Was she an actress?
5989600	5992600	Yeah, and I don't want to say too much about it.
5992600	5993600	So he was a mentor to her?
5993600	6003600	Yes, and for two hours, she sat in my car, crying, telling me her story, all of the details.
6003600	6006600	And at that moment, something changed for me.
6006600	6011600	She turned to me and she said, she wiped her face, and she said, do you believe me?
6011600	6013600	And I said, yes, I believe you.
6013600	6022600	And that was the change. And I had to look with sober eyes at what was going on.
6022600	6028600	This turn of events dramatically shifted public perception of Bill Cosby and, by extension, his body of work.
6028600	6033600	One immediate effect was the season seven episode, Last Barbecue, being pulled from syndication.
6033600	6039600	In it, Cliff brewed up special barbecue sauce that could put whoever tasted it into a sexual mood.
6039600	6043600	Haven't you ever noticed after people have some of my barbecue sauce?
6043600	6046600	After a while, when it kicks in, they get all huggy buggy.
6046600	6053600	Another challenge to experiencing the series was the knowledge that some of the actresses who appeared on the show were preyed upon by Cosby.
6053600	6057600	It introduces a complication when it comes to looking back at certain episodes,
6057600	6064600	how they can possibly be enjoyed when we know the actress we're seeing on screen has been victimized by the actor sitting next to them.
6064600	6066600	This isn't a new phenomena, of course.
6066600	6074600	Once you do know the truth, it's very hard, at least for me, to not see the real life stories in front of whatever narrative is unfolding on the screen.
6074600	6080600	A number of articles were produced reflecting on how our new public image of Bill Cosby impacted the Cosby Show.
6080600	6082600	For Salon, Chauncey DeVega wrote,
6082600	6087600	As a child of the hip-hop generation and a member of the black working class, I grew up loving the Cosby Show.
6087600	6095600	Nevertheless, I have no shame in admitting that I have much more in common with the white folks on Roseanne or the black family on rock than I ever could with the Huxtables.
6095600	6100600	And in the Chicago Tribune, reflected on the Cosby guilty verdict, Dileen Glanton wrote,
6125600	6128600	Our mistake was in trying to make Cliff and Cosby one and the same.
6128600	6137600	The most striking image of the shifting perspective of the Cosby Show came from the 2015 cover of Ebony magazine showing a shattered portrait, the fractures coming from Cosby himself.
6137600	6144600	The editor-in-chief of Ebony at the time, Kieran Omayo, wrote in 2018 on Cosby's guilty verdict as well.
6144600	6150600	Cliff Huxtable's existence wasn't as much about truth, damn right, as it was about archetypal representation.
6150600	6156600	Perhaps not enough of us in black America had seen or remembered this figure before the Cosby Show and Lord knows.
6156600	6160600	Until then, white America was virtually certain he never existed.
6160600	6167600	I know that beautiful black men like my father who do not abuse exist across generations and have through every era of American life.
6167600	6175600	Therefore, I refuse to have my passion and pride for the creative genius and iconography of the Cosby Show allow me to be the slightest bit confused.
6175600	6188600	I don't have to ride for the fallen decrepit Bill Cosby to prove what I know about black excellence, black decency, black humor, black art, black colleges, black family, black mothers, or black male heroes.
6188600	6196600	Although Bill Cosby will likely forever be viewed as a predator first, the fiction of the Bill Cosby Show may still have a lasting legacy outside of that.
6197600	6208600	Many works of art have been created by artists who have said and done reprehensible things, and we all have to decide for ourselves where we draw the line on what it means to enjoy a work of art, knowing those facts.
6208600	6214600	Reading what Mayo got from the Cosby Show reflect the power of a person's experience with a work of art.
6214600	6220600	The death of the author, written by Roland Barthes, is often cited when describing how to separate art from the artist.
6220600	6237600	In the case of Bill Cosby, his failings of a person have created a metaphorical public death of sorts, and because of that, those who wish to hold on to his creative works, such as the Cosby Show, are taking that final step of removing him entirely from the equation and creating an appreciation of the Cosby Show that is truly their own.
6237600	6251600	Before the Cosby Show, Felicia Rashad had primarily worked on stage, and at the end of the series, she would once again return to that space.
6251600	6258600	She had a number of roles on screen as well, perhaps most notably starring alongside Bill Cosby in the 1996 series, Cosby.
6258600	6266600	In 2004, she won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for A Raisin in the Sun, making her the first black actress to ever win that award.
6266600	6272600	Following the end of the Cosby Show, Lisa Bonet went on to appear in a number of different films, such as High Fidelity and Enemy of the State.
6272600	6281600	She's also had a handful of roles on television, though she seems to have devoted much of her time to raising her three children, and in 2017, she married fellow performer Jason Momoa.
6281600	6287600	Malcolm Jamal Warner branched out in directing, having directed several episodes of the Cosby Show in its later seasons.
6287600	6294600	He still managed to continue acting as well, appearing in numerous TV shows and movies, notably starring in his own sitcom, Malcolm and Eddie.
6294600	6304600	He even released a few albums, and in 2015 won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance, along with Robert Glasper and Lala Hathaway for Jesus Children.
6304600	6308600	Tempest Bledsoe hosted a talk show briefly, titled The Tempest Bledsoe Show.
6308600	6311600	She's also performed in a number of different productions.
6311600	6317600	Since 1993, she has been in a relationship with Daryl M. Bell, who starred on A Different World.
6317600	6325600	Keisha Knight Pulliam made history in 1986, being the youngest person nominated for an Emmy at the age of six for her work on the Cosby Show.
6325600	6334600	Following the show's end, she continued acting, having found success in a number of roles, most notably as Miranda Lucas Payne on Tyler Perry's House of Pain.
6334600	6341600	Sabrina LaBeouf finds herself performing as the lead at a number of productions with the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, DC.
6341600	6346600	Jeffrey Owens had a handful of roles following the Cosby Show, though none that had quite the same prominence.
6346600	6355600	In 2018, photos of Owens surfaced, showing him working at Trader Joe's, bagging groceries, which unfortunately drew a lot of negative attention, forcing him to quit.
6355600	6362600	Tyler Perry offered Owens a role in the Haves and Have Nots for ten episodes, which seems to have led to a revival of his acting career.
6362600	6368600	Joseph C. Phillips has been acting extensively since the ending of the series, notably as Justice Ward on General Hospital.
6368600	6371600	He also works as a conservative commentator.
6371600	6377600	Raven Simone went from the Cosby Show directly to another sitcom, hanging with Mr. Cooper, which ran for four years.
6377600	6383600	She was the lead in That's So Raven on the Disney Channel, during which she was nominated for a number of awards.
6383600	6386600	Following that series, she's gone on to appear in countless TV shows and movies.
6386600	6390600	She's also had a prolific singing career, releasing four studio albums.
6390600	6397600	Erika Alexander immediately moved on to a second series, Living Single, where she played the role Maxine Shaw for five seasons.
6398600	6402600	She has been working consistently ever since, with roles in a number of movies and TV shows.
6402600	6407600	Some notable recent roles for her were in the film Get Out and the CW series Black Lightning.
6407600	6414600	On June 30, 2021, Bill Cosby's conviction was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.
6414600	6425600	They found that the testimony from the 2005 civil case used by the prosecution in the 2015 criminal case had included an agreement by the previous prosecutor that Cosby would not be criminally charged.
6425600	6436600	District Attorney Kevin Steele, who had prosecuted Cosby in 2015, said that Cosby was found guilty by a jury and now goes free on a procedural issue that is irrelevant to the facts of the crime.
6436600	6443600	Steele also expressed hope that this result will not deter future victims of sexual assault from coming forward.
6443600	6448600	To talk about the Cosby Show, I think it's important to understand the context around it.
6448600	6453600	In a sense, it may be completely unfair to put so much into understanding a single sitcom.
6453600	6461600	Other sitcoms, particularly ones with white casts, aren't expected to redefine racial politics or spark radical discourse on social justice.
6461600	6466600	But one successful show story in a black cast suddenly has that burden placed upon it.
6466600	6469600	But contrary to that, the Cosby Show wasn't just another sitcom.
6469600	6479600	It was one of the most popular sitcoms of all time, and I think it's important to ask how it got there by looking at what it did and what it didn't, and then when it got there, what it did with its new prominence.
6480600	6490600	I think an important lesson we can take away from the Cosby Show is that representation in media has a profound impact, and what a piece of media does with that representation matters as well.
6490600	6497600	Although being seen and visible has value, what is done with that visibility can take a good show and make it truly great.
6500600	6505600	This video was very tough to make.
6505600	6509600	Watching the eight seasons of the Cosby Show wasn't even the toughest part.
6509600	6521600	Collecting the research and reading all the different opinions and analyses of the show really broadened my perspective and made me appreciate a show in a way that perhaps I wouldn't have seen simply watching it on my own.
6521600	6533600	A lot of hard work went into making this video, so if you would like to see more of these in the future, please consider becoming a patron or a member for this channel, like these fine names coming up the screen now.
6533600	6542600	It's because of these people that I was able to hang on for just a little bit longer, making sure this video was as good as it can be, and I hope that came across.
