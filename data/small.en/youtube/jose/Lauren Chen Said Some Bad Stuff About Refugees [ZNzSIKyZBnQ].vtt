WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.720
So, this video was not supposed to happen.

00:04.720 --> 00:06.480
I'm in the middle of a very big project.

00:06.480 --> 00:10.900
It's another deep dive into something you've probably heard of this time.

00:10.900 --> 00:16.740
But today I saw a video from Lauren Chen, and it just really pissed me off.

00:16.740 --> 00:21.020
So here I am making a response video to it because there were so many factual errors

00:21.020 --> 00:25.500
in it, so many ridiculous statements that I just couldn't help myself.

00:25.500 --> 00:28.040
So let's dive into this video.

00:28.040 --> 00:34.000
It's titled Immigration Crisis, Take More Migrants Says UN.

00:34.000 --> 00:39.000
As Global News reports, quote, the United Nations is urging Canada to help ease Mexico's

00:39.000 --> 00:44.200
refugee burden by helping resettle some of the most vulnerable of its new arrivals, including

00:44.200 --> 00:47.480
women, children, and LGBTQ2 people.

00:47.480 --> 00:52.120
Mexico is feeling the squeeze from an unprecedented exodus of people fleeing Central American

00:52.120 --> 00:53.120
countries.

00:53.120 --> 00:57.760
And some of the worst violence from nations not actually at war is forcing families northward.

00:57.760 --> 01:02.720
Our pitch to Canada is to do more, said Mark Manley, the Mexico representative of the United

01:02.720 --> 01:04.920
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

01:04.920 --> 01:09.160
The article continues that the request comes as the United States takes a harder line on

01:09.160 --> 01:13.140
its Mexican border, with President Donald Trump branding the caravans of migrants as

01:13.140 --> 01:16.560
being laced with violent criminals bent on destabilizing his country.

01:16.560 --> 01:18.080
Oh look, the first error.

01:18.080 --> 01:22.800
We're not talking about migrants crossing borders here, we're talking about refugees

01:22.800 --> 01:24.640
being resettled.

01:24.640 --> 01:28.880
The way the refugee resettlement process works is that someone fleeing their country applies

01:28.880 --> 01:30.240
for asylum.

01:30.240 --> 01:34.240
And if they're granted asylum and given refugee status, they can then apply to be

01:34.240 --> 01:36.320
moved somewhere else.

01:36.320 --> 01:41.040
We're talking about people who have fled Central America to Mexico, applied for asylum,

01:41.040 --> 01:44.960
been given refugee status, and then are being transferred over to Canada.

01:44.960 --> 01:48.380
They shouldn't be considered vaguely defined migrants.

01:48.380 --> 01:50.600
These are vetted refugees.

01:50.600 --> 01:53.540
Here's an example of the numbers Lauren Chen loves so much.

01:53.540 --> 01:57.180
The ones that seem like they're arguing for her point, but when you actually dig

01:57.180 --> 02:00.180
into them, don't really do that.

02:00.180 --> 02:06.140
In 2018, under the leadership of Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party, Canada resettled more

02:06.140 --> 02:08.980
refugees than any other country.

02:08.980 --> 02:15.060
As the BBC reports, the country accepted just over 28,000 refugees last year, with the United

02:15.060 --> 02:18.440
States coming in second with 22,900.

02:18.440 --> 02:23.920
But to anyone who would ask Canada to do more, those numbers should tell you that we

02:23.920 --> 02:26.520
have already done more than enough.

02:26.520 --> 02:31.080
The reason Canada, the United States, and Australia rank so high for resettlement numbers

02:31.080 --> 02:34.280
is because it's very difficult for refugees to get here.

02:34.280 --> 02:38.440
They'd basically have to swim across the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean just to get to Canada.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.800
So generally, they don't have to worry about a lot of refugees showing up at their borders.

02:41.800 --> 02:46.400
If we look at the BBC article, Chen's sights mentions that there are 70 million people

02:46.400 --> 02:48.280
who are currently displaced.

02:48.280 --> 02:50.680
70 million.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.680
Canada resettled 28,000.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.120
Consider that disparity for a moment.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.400
You might be wondering where these people are.

02:58.400 --> 03:04.840
The top five countries currently taking care of refugees are Turkey with 3.7 million refugees,

03:04.840 --> 03:11.480
Pakistan with 1.4 million refugees, Uganda with 1.2 million, Sudan with 1.1 million,

03:11.480 --> 03:15.060
and Germany with 1.1 million.

03:15.060 --> 03:17.700
That 28,000 number isn't exactly accurate.

03:17.700 --> 03:21.660
That was just how many Canada took in within 2018 itself.

03:21.660 --> 03:29.340
The total number of refugees currently living in Canada is 114,109.

03:29.340 --> 03:32.860
And there are currently 78,806 asylum seekers.

03:32.860 --> 03:36.820
The difference between a refugee and an asylum seeker is that an asylum seeker is generally

03:36.820 --> 03:39.460
someone who is applying for refugee status.

03:39.460 --> 03:43.940
A refugee is actually a legally defined term, one that is given to someone who has been

03:43.940 --> 03:50.820
properly vetted by, for example, the UN-HCR, which is the UN Refugee Agency.

03:50.820 --> 03:55.580
From here, the video turns into a lot of generic vague UN bashing.

03:55.580 --> 03:59.900
She actually made a whole video where she criticizes the UN and she doesn't seem to

03:59.900 --> 04:06.860
understand it and what it's supposed to do, so she just seems to think it does nothing.

04:06.860 --> 04:07.860
Think of it.

04:07.860 --> 04:13.060
What national long-term policies, which have made countries better, can the UN take credit

04:13.060 --> 04:14.060
for?

04:14.060 --> 04:17.100
The UN isn't responsible for national policy.

04:17.100 --> 04:20.060
That would be the responsibility of a nation's federal government.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.820
The UN isn't a governing body.

04:22.820 --> 04:25.540
I don't know how to explain this more simply.

04:25.540 --> 04:30.500
If you're complaining that the UN hasn't fixed these nations, whatever that means,

04:30.500 --> 04:32.660
it's not because the UN hasn't been trying.

04:32.660 --> 04:37.420
It all depends on the participation of the member nations to make it all work.

04:37.420 --> 04:42.540
What the UN tries to pitch is them improving the world, is simply moving people from bad

04:42.540 --> 04:45.820
countries to good countries.

04:45.820 --> 04:49.900
And then she says something like this, where she's under the impression that the UN's

04:49.900 --> 04:54.540
primary goal has been to relocate people through its refugee program.

04:54.540 --> 05:00.900
The UN-HCR's mission is not to fix countries with any sort of internal strife, it's to

05:00.900 --> 05:04.140
protect the well-being of people who have been displaced.

05:04.140 --> 05:08.820
I don't know why the UN is being defined by a single program that operates under the

05:08.820 --> 05:13.940
General Assembly, and then being judged for not meeting these other unnamed goals.

05:13.940 --> 05:18.580
But it's an absurdly reductous reading of one of the most important institutions in

05:18.580 --> 05:19.660
the world.

05:19.660 --> 05:26.500
And if you want a list of some of the things the UN has done, it's helped eradicate smallpox.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.460
I think that's pretty good.

05:28.460 --> 05:33.340
Through UNICEF, it's saved the lives of tens of millions of children.

05:33.340 --> 05:37.900
It's helped reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

05:37.900 --> 05:43.180
The General Assembly's clamping down on South Africa helped end apartheid in the region.

05:43.180 --> 05:46.620
It's actually done a lot of really great things in the world, and I'll include links with

05:46.620 --> 05:49.660
even more stuff it's done in the description box.

05:49.660 --> 05:52.580
Let's take a moment to see Lauren fail to read.

05:52.580 --> 05:58.020
Article 14 of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the

05:58.020 --> 06:02.300
right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.860
Uh, I'm sorry, no.

06:04.860 --> 06:07.060
How on earth is that a human right?

06:07.060 --> 06:10.140
I mean, I guess you could say you have the right to seek asylum.

06:10.140 --> 06:15.100
You can seek whatever you want, I suppose, but you don't have the right to enjoy asylum

06:15.100 --> 06:16.900
in other countries.

06:16.900 --> 06:18.860
Where would that right come from?

06:18.860 --> 06:21.500
No, that's not how you read that.

06:21.500 --> 06:26.460
No one is saying everyone can simply be granted asylum on request.

06:26.460 --> 06:31.420
The term enjoy asylum means that no person should ever be forbidden from being granted

06:31.420 --> 06:32.420
asylum.

06:32.420 --> 06:36.240
That is, someone who has gone through the asylum application process and being granted

06:36.240 --> 06:37.880
refugee status.

06:37.880 --> 06:41.800
Pretty much every country in the world has some number of refugees living in it, so the

06:41.800 --> 06:46.160
fact that this simple article blows Lauren's mind shows how little she understands the

06:46.160 --> 06:47.160
process.

06:47.160 --> 06:51.780
Literally, no country on earth, as far as I know, grants asylum to anyone who shows

06:51.780 --> 06:53.320
up and asks for it.

06:53.320 --> 06:58.280
There's always a vetting process, and considering the UNHCR helps manage a lot of these vetting

06:58.280 --> 07:01.160
processes, I think they support them.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.160
Not to mention that persecution is just such a vague word.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.760
Essentially, all it means is ill treatment or hostility.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.440
No, it doesn't.

07:09.440 --> 07:15.120
Okay, let's actually do something fun and talk about what a refugee is actually defined

07:15.120 --> 07:17.720
as according to the UNHCR.

07:17.720 --> 07:22.960
A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution,

07:22.960 --> 07:23.960
war, or violence.

07:23.960 --> 07:29.280
A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality,

07:29.280 --> 07:33.120
political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.680
Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so.

07:36.680 --> 07:42.680
War and ethnic, tribal, and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their

07:42.680 --> 07:43.800
countries.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.880
That seems pretty specific.

07:46.880 --> 07:50.760
Lauren seems to be under the impression that there is no vetting process.

07:50.760 --> 07:54.880
Everybody in that country gets to just leave and choose another country to move to, and

07:54.880 --> 07:58.360
it has to be granted because it's their human right to seek asylum.

07:58.360 --> 08:03.200
Does any Western European person who speaks out against Islam or mass immigration, what

08:03.200 --> 08:09.280
they call hate speech over there, get to come to the US and seek asylum under this declaration?

08:09.280 --> 08:10.520
Is that how that works?

08:10.520 --> 08:11.520
That's weird.

08:11.520 --> 08:15.360
I hear a lot of anti-Islam stuff coming out of Western Europe all the time, but I guess

08:15.360 --> 08:18.280
they're being persecuted somewhere, okay?

08:18.280 --> 08:23.480
As far as I can tell, no one from Western Europe has applied for asylum because they've

08:23.480 --> 08:27.000
been persecuted for speaking out against Islam.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.040
They can try that.

08:28.040 --> 08:31.080
I don't think that application is going to turn out so well.

08:31.080 --> 08:35.440
The fact that she thinks the UN-HCRC is no difference between that and someone who's

08:35.440 --> 08:40.720
trying to escape a war zone, it stretches my ability to believe she's being a serious

08:40.720 --> 08:41.720
person.

08:41.720 --> 08:44.200
Now she's going to say something even more ridiculous.

08:44.200 --> 08:48.120
What the UN is saying is that it would be someone's human right to just show up at your

08:48.120 --> 08:51.400
country and say, hey, I'm going to enjoy asylum here.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.560
And in order to not violate their rights, not only would you have to let them in, but

08:55.560 --> 09:00.600
you would also be obligated to give them food, housing, and clothing.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.840
F*** you!

09:01.840 --> 09:04.520
I'm genuinely stunned at this.

09:04.520 --> 09:10.240
Okay, leaving aside Lauren's outrage at the idea that all people should have access to

09:10.240 --> 09:16.280
food and shelter, somehow confusing it with the UN advocating some sort of socialist nanny

09:16.280 --> 09:18.840
state, I think that's how she's reading it.

09:18.840 --> 09:24.720
Leaving all that aside, an asylum seeker actually is entitled to food and shelter.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.360
The reason asylum seekers are giving these things is because once they apply for asylum,

09:29.360 --> 09:33.200
they are essentially in the custody of the government in which they're applying to.

09:33.200 --> 09:38.880
When a government takes a person into custody, it's expected to provide them food and shelter.

09:38.880 --> 09:44.600
This is truly basic stuff, and Lauren's response to the idea that people the government takes

09:44.600 --> 09:48.320
into custody should be given food and shelter is f*** you!

09:48.320 --> 09:53.480
I wonder if she could be so brazen to say this to some of the refugee children currently

09:53.480 --> 09:57.520
staying in Mexico after fleeing their homes in Central America.

09:57.520 --> 10:01.600
You know the exact people the original article she mentioned was discussing?

10:01.600 --> 10:05.520
The people who are fleeing gang violence and who are often the target?

10:05.520 --> 10:09.600
Boys for recruitment, girls for… much worse than that.

10:09.600 --> 10:14.600
When they would come seeking asylum, the idea of giving them food and shelter, Lauren would

10:14.600 --> 10:15.600
say,

10:15.600 --> 10:16.600
F*** you!

10:16.600 --> 10:17.600
Okay.

10:17.600 --> 10:23.720
And frankly, the entire asylum process right now just needs to be revamped.

10:23.720 --> 10:27.600
As it stands, anyone can show up at your board or request asylum.

10:27.600 --> 10:31.440
You have to clothe them, feed them, provide them medical attention, even if you don't

10:31.440 --> 10:32.440
end up letting them in.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.440
Yes.

10:33.440 --> 10:36.000
Yes, you do have to do that.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
Absolutely.

10:37.000 --> 10:41.000
If someone applies for asylum and is willing to be taken into the custody of the government

10:41.000 --> 10:45.160
and go through that lengthy process, yes, you do have to provide food and shelter for

10:45.160 --> 10:46.160
them.

10:46.160 --> 10:49.680
There used to be stricter guidelines of who does and does not qualify so you don't end

10:49.680 --> 10:54.720
up with entire countries showing up at your board or demanding to be let in because their

10:54.720 --> 10:57.960
life would be better if they lived in your country.

10:57.960 --> 11:01.060
She seems to think this is something that people will take advantage of.

11:01.060 --> 11:05.480
People will show up at a nation's borders and demand asylum because they really want

11:05.480 --> 11:10.480
to stay locked up in a hotel somewhere for three months or really have much of a life.

11:10.480 --> 11:14.680
Apparently, to her, that seems like something people would swim across the Atlantic Ocean

11:14.680 --> 11:20.040
or fly here just to do that until an entire country shows up, requests asylum so they

11:20.040 --> 11:22.560
can be locked up here for a couple of months.

11:22.560 --> 11:27.280
I don't think the system needs to be revamped for something that isn't happening.

11:27.280 --> 11:32.120
If country A is experiencing mass violence, sectarian warfare, or in general is failing

11:32.120 --> 11:36.440
economically, what do you think moving everyone out of that country and putting them in a

11:36.440 --> 11:39.040
different country is going to do?

11:39.040 --> 11:40.520
Save their lives.

11:40.520 --> 11:44.440
Do you think these people will just start magically behaving differently because their

11:44.440 --> 11:46.080
geography has changed?

11:46.080 --> 11:50.240
Sure, some individuals will be fine and be able to acclimate and succeed, but we're

11:50.240 --> 11:53.760
not talking about individually screening people, are we?

11:53.760 --> 11:56.440
No, we're talking about mass relocation.

11:56.440 --> 11:58.960
We're not talking about resettling individuals.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.880
We're resettling groups.

12:00.880 --> 12:05.400
She seems to think that asylum is something that's granted en masse with no real screening

12:05.400 --> 12:06.400
or vetting.

12:06.400 --> 12:07.960
That's not how it works.

12:07.960 --> 12:12.240
People are screened individually when applying for asylum.

12:12.240 --> 12:16.880
Voting has always been a part of the refugee process, and typically the people who are

12:16.880 --> 12:21.000
causing the problems in that country generally aren't trying to go somewhere else.

12:21.000 --> 12:27.720
No one who's a brutal dictator in, say, Syria, for example, is going to pack up their life,

12:27.720 --> 12:30.840
go live as a refugee in Sweden somewhere.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.440
They're going to continue living on in a place where they can freely oppress and brutalize

12:34.440 --> 12:35.680
the citizenry.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.560
This is about helping people who are trying to escape that.

12:38.560 --> 12:42.440
The fact that she doesn't understand this, the fact that she sees them as, like, parasites

12:42.440 --> 12:46.800
who are coming to suck the resources out of a country, it's truly revolting, and it shows

12:46.800 --> 12:50.440
how little she understands what it means to be a refugee.

12:50.440 --> 12:54.680
What's especially worrying was glancing at the comments section and all the people complaining

12:54.680 --> 12:57.240
about illegal immigration.

12:57.240 --> 13:00.080
Here's one comment that Lauren herself liked.

13:00.080 --> 13:04.240
Dear Lauren, my parents were legal immigrants to the US.

13:04.240 --> 13:05.240
They applied to the US.

13:05.240 --> 13:08.960
They waited the necessary five years and then moved legally to the US.

13:08.960 --> 13:12.960
My parents were DPs in Europe, meaning they had been displaced by the war and could not

13:12.960 --> 13:16.600
go back to their countries at the end of the war because their countries had been overrun

13:16.600 --> 13:17.600
by communists.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.480
I have absolutely no care whatsoever about the illegals.

13:20.480 --> 13:25.400
If they want to come here, legally let them go through the process.

13:25.400 --> 13:30.860
Applying for asylum and being granted refugee status is the legal process.

13:30.860 --> 13:33.800
This is not about illegal immigration.

13:33.800 --> 13:37.000
There are a number of other comments that make references to illegal immigration, and

13:37.000 --> 13:42.080
if I were Lauren, I would be alarmed, alarmed that so many people in my comments are so

13:42.080 --> 13:43.080
misinformed.

13:43.080 --> 13:47.160
They don't even understand what the video is about, but then again, Lauren doesn't even

13:47.160 --> 13:50.800
understand what she's talking about, so it's not a surprise that her viewers are similarly

13:50.800 --> 13:52.720
misinformed.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.600
It really depresses me.

13:54.600 --> 13:58.160
Refugees are some of the most vulnerable people in the world.

13:58.160 --> 14:03.360
When I see this sort of nonsense being pushed against them, it makes me really angry, and

14:03.360 --> 14:06.960
I probably sound more sad than angry right now because I've had a couple of hours to

14:06.960 --> 14:12.460
cool off, write this little script out in a bit of a fury, and now I just feel kind

14:12.460 --> 14:13.860
of sad.

14:13.860 --> 14:19.740
Sad to think how campaigning like this reduces the number of refugees who are, again, granted

14:19.740 --> 14:25.140
that specific status and are being turned away because there's all this misinformation

14:25.140 --> 14:29.140
from people who really have no interest in allowing others in.

14:29.140 --> 14:33.340
These are the sentiments that leads to overcrowding in refugee camps because the native population

14:33.800 --> 14:35.400
sees them as a threat.

14:35.400 --> 14:41.940
These are the words and ideas that create this fiction that refugees are a danger and

14:41.940 --> 14:47.140
are likely to cause crime and trouble in their host nations, something the stats don't really

14:47.140 --> 14:49.300
support.

14:49.300 --> 14:51.220
I want us to do better than this.

14:51.220 --> 15:02.060
We can do better than these ideas, these sentiments, and I hope one day we will.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.700
So this video is a bit of a venting.

15:03.700 --> 15:06.260
Again, I wasn't planning on making this video.

15:06.260 --> 15:10.580
I'm doing this one very quickly because I'm in the midst of a very large project.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.720
It's another deep dive into another video about refugees.

15:14.720 --> 15:17.100
This video is already longer than I expected.

15:17.100 --> 15:20.280
I just want to close it up by thanking all my patrons.

15:20.280 --> 15:24.100
Their names are on the screen, and they are some truly lovely people.

15:24.100 --> 15:28.860
If you would like to be as wonderful as those patrons, you can head over to my Patreon and

15:28.860 --> 15:31.900
donate whatever you're comfortable with, whatever is in your means.

15:31.900 --> 15:37.180
Please don't go hungry on account of giving me money, but I do appreciate every little

15:37.180 --> 15:42.380
bit someone can spare me because these videos are a labor of love, and it takes a bit of

15:42.380 --> 15:47.000
time out of my life to produce them, and I appreciate everyone who watches them.

15:47.000 --> 15:49.680
Everyone who subscribes, likes, leaves a comment.

15:49.680 --> 15:52.700
I do this for all of you, and I hope it's appreciated.

15:52.700 --> 15:56.020
And if it's not, I don't know, go watch a Lauren Chen video.

15:56.020 --> 15:57.620
No, don't watch that.

15:57.620 --> 15:58.620
Go outside.

15:58.620 --> 15:59.620
Live.

15:59.620 --> 16:00.620
Enjoy your life.

16:00.620 --> 16:04.220
I understand that there are people out there sitting in refugee camps who could be resettled

16:04.220 --> 16:06.940
to a nation, and enjoy a life as well.

16:06.940 --> 16:11.820
If only it weren't for demagogues like Lauren Chen speaking out against them.

16:11.820 --> 16:12.420
Thanks for watching.
