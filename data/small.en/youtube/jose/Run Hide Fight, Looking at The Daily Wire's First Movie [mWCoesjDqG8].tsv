0	2000	This is not a good movie.
2000	7440	The world is great, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.
7440	11440	On January 4th, right-wing news commentary website The Daily Wire
11440	14480	announced it had purchased the distribution rights to the movie
14480	20480	Run, Hide, Fight, a movie that is often described as die-hard set in a school shooting.
20480	24000	The movie is part of the Daily Wire's attempt to move into the world of entertainment,
24000	28080	according to an article written by one of the Daily Wire co-founders, Ben Shapiro.
28160	30000	We're going to be bringing out movies.
30000	33760	Edgy, entertaining, awesome movies that won't mock your values.
33760	37680	We're going to be producing TV shows, comedies and dramas that take you seriously
37680	41200	and that don't take advantage of your viewership to promote leftist causes.
41840	45520	The Daily Wire is currently developing one feature and two TV series,
45520	47920	though no specific details about those have been announced.
48480	53920	Part ofly, madly, desperately hopes they're adapting the works of Ben Shapiro for the screen.
53920	58000	Sadly, Run, Hide, Fight was not inspired by the written works of Ben Shapiro.
58000	62160	In fact, this film was produced completely independently of The Daily Wire's new
62160	66160	initiative and their only attachment to Run, Hide, Fight is to be its distributor.
66160	72320	There are no grim bread hawthorn esquiros or drug dealers posing as civil rights activists.
72320	77440	Instead, we have a simpler story of a teenage girl who has to gun down her classmates after
77440	78720	they try to shoot up their school.
79280	83280	An action movie used in a school shooting as a backdrop doesn't scream leftist values,
83280	86400	so I can see why they chose this as their first film to distribute.
86400	89600	The article also echoes an important lesson learned from Andrew Breitbart,
89600	93760	who Shapiro calls his mentor, the idea of politics being downstream from culture.
93760	96880	This move into the entertainment industry is, according to Shapiro,
96880	100320	about fighting back against the left who supposedly dominate
100320	103280	the major institutions of the entertainment industry.
103920	107280	According to Jeremy Boring, co-CEO of The Daily Wire,
107840	111040	this is a gut-wrenching film that refuses to offer easy talking points,
111040	115040	which is why liberal Hollywood executives have refused to distribute it.
115120	117280	The trailer had a very strong reaction on YouTube,
117280	121440	with nearly 1.5 million views within its first two weeks of going up.
121440	124560	The movie takes its name from a survival tactic recommended to people
124560	127840	and instructing them on how to survive a mass shooting incident.
127840	132800	This weird, cheesy training video is on YouTube and has over 9 million views.
132800	136560	Run, Hide, Fight made its North American debut on January 14th
136560	140080	in a streaming event hosted on the Daily Wire website in YouTube.
140080	143360	According to Boring, the stream had over 70,000 viewers,
143360	146880	but the more important question, how was the movie?
147840	150800	The plot is very easily summarized.
150800	153920	High school senior Zoe Hall, played by Isabel May,
153920	157440	is disengaging from her life following the recent passing of her mother.
157440	161760	Upon going to school, her day is interrupted by the arrival of four school shooters
161760	164800	who take some of their classmates hostage in the cafeteria.
164800	170160	The shooters livestream the hostage situation while Zoe first runs, hides, and then fights.
170240	174640	She takes out each of the three cronies before killing their ringleader in the movie's final moments.
175520	178880	Not exactly a plot filled with surprising twists and turns,
178880	181600	and one completely predictable for anyone who saw the trailer.
181600	186640	In spite of the subject material, this is a movie that very safely follows the action movie formulas.
186640	189440	School shootings are indeed a rare topic in films.
189440	192000	There are several of them out there, such as Elephant,
192000	195440	We Need to Talk About Kevin, Polytechnique, and a handful of others.
195440	199360	They often take artistic approaches you don't typically see in mainstream movies.
199360	202080	The very real horror of a school shooting seems to demand
202080	205360	filmmakers use unorthodox methods to broach the subject.
205360	207920	Or maybe it's just a subject that attracts filmmakers
207920	211200	whose talents don't neatly fit into the mainstream mold.
211920	214560	But this is not one of those movies.
214560	218080	Throughout its run, Run, Hide, Fight feels like a popcorn movie.
218080	221040	Which is a strange experience, considering the subject matter.
221040	225280	It seems to be asking the audience to compartmentalize the very real tragedy of a school shooting,
225280	229600	put all that baggage aside, and watch the movie as a form of entertainment.
229600	232080	The idea of ignoring the tragedy of a school shooting,
232080	236560	at least insofar in wanting to discuss it politically, is often a project of the right.
236560	240880	Whenever a school shooting happens, conversations about gun control are immediately silenced,
240880	244880	and at best you might get some token discussion about mental health.
244880	246720	Discussion that isn't terribly helpful,
246720	250720	considering most mental health conditions don't result in school shootings.
250720	252400	In fact, the vast majority don't.
252400	256160	What we're more likely to hear are refrains about not wanting to disrespect
256160	258960	the victims by politicizing a tragedy.
259600	263200	In other words, don't consider any potential political action
263200	266160	that might reduce the possibility of future school shootings.
266160	269520	With that in mind, it's unsurprising that a conservative audience might be more capable
269520	273840	of compartmentalizing a phenomena that right-wing media rarely critically examines.
273840	276160	School shootings are something to be prepared for,
276160	280640	but are also something that we're supposedly unable to actively prevent.
280640	283360	Movies like this seem to be suggesting that school shootings,
283360	287360	a rarity outside of the last few decades, are now part of the new normal.
287360	290240	So we might as well make some action movies about them.
290240	295040	This movie has a hero, Zoe Hall, which is a rarity for movies about school shootings.
295040	298240	After all, if the purpose of the film is to explore the tragedy,
298240	301680	a hero who prevents said tragedy seems counterproductive.
301680	304000	In this case, the movie tries to have it both ways,
304000	307600	featuring a number of students getting killed at the beginning of the hostage situation.
307600	310880	Also, unlike other movies about school shootings, in the opening scene of the movie,
310880	314640	the impending school shooting is foreshadowed with heavy-handed dialogue.
314640	316000	I'm gonna record an EP this summer.
316000	316640	No way.
316640	319200	Yeah, give the dream a shot before reality kicks me in the cooch.
319200	320080	Nice!
320080	321120	Jump cut scares.
323280	323680	Okay!
324560	326560	And two different explosions.
327120	328320	This is not a subtle film.
329120	333120	Zoe is one of those strange leading characters who happens to be the only one in the movie with
333120	336480	functioning eyes and notices something is slightly off during the day,
336480	339600	such as the smoke from an explosion moving across the sky.
339600	342960	Strangely though, Zoe completely misses the beginning of the school shooting.
342960	346960	It unfolds with the quartet of shooters crashing their van into the cafeteria
346960	348560	and firing off a machine gun.
348560	350800	Zoe, who's in the cafeteria washroom,
350800	355760	can't hear any of this over what must be the loudest hand dryer in the history of mankind.
355760	357440	And no one else in the school hears it either.
357440	359040	Classes go about normally.
359040	362880	While I can't speak to the structure of high schools in rural Nebraska,
362880	366160	I have to imagine someone would hear a van smashing into the cafeteria
366160	368160	and the machine gun fire that followed.
368160	370240	We then meet the villains of the movie.
370240	373280	Their leader, Tristan, played by Eli Brown,
373280	377280	is instantly unlikable as he acts like a cheesy action movie villain.
377280	382160	I suppose we're meant to hate him, but I just wanted him off my screen.
382160	384400	Tristan has a master plan to shoot up the school.
384400	389120	You see, those explosions earlier were planted by him and his pals to distract the cops.
389120	391280	They then disable the school's internal systems,
391280	395040	arrange a livestream, and plant even more explosives around the school.
395040	397760	These are surprisingly competent school shooters.
397760	400480	If this nefarious plot sounds a little familiar to you,
400480	403760	it's probably because Tristan also happens to be the Joker.
403760	407120	His scheming is very similar to the Joker's in The Dark Knight,
407120	409120	who plows a bus into a bank,
409120	411840	has his minions disrupt the building's internal systems,
411840	414640	and disguises himself as one of his victims to escape.
414640	418480	There's also an echo of the classic Joker with one of Tristan's followers
418480	423280	being this goth-like Harley Quinn figure Anna, played by Catherine Davis.
423280	426880	And if you look closely, Tristan's gait kind of looks like the one
426880	428800	Keith Ledger is doing in The Dark Knight.
428800	431040	To be fair though, if someone did try to shoot up a school,
431040	434080	I wouldn't be surprised if they thought of themselves as the Joker too.
434080	436400	I would have guessed the Joaquin Phoenix version.
436400	439680	Tristan's motivations are a bit less interesting than the Joker's though.
439680	442800	He wants to be famous. On social media.
442800	446240	And instead of starting a YouTube channel where he complains about women in Star Wars,
446240	449440	he's decided to create the definitive school shooting.
449440	452080	Okay? Everybody watching is culpable.
452080	454720	You all post, and you tweet, and you share.
455360	458800	Everybody jumps at the chance to be both judge and jury, but in that system...
458800	462400	Be sure that you created a job opening.
464240	465280	An executioner.
468160	469120	You created me.
471200	472160	And what does it for you?
472880	473380	Uh...
476320	478000	Being definitive.
479840	483120	And creating the ultimate version of something.
483120	486160	The only interesting thing about Tristan is that, secretly,
486720	488400	I think he's a conservative.
488400	490640	Here are a few telltale lines of dialogue.
490640	492800	We get a cheesy joke about trigger warnings.
495200	496000	Trigger warnings.
496000	499840	He laughs at how inept school security is without a gun.
499840	503600	As if it's not sad enough that they're only paying them $12 an hour to protect our school,
503600	505680	they expect you to do without a f***ing gun?
505680	507520	And we get this little nugget to see a lip.
508240	510080	It's not that hard to build a wall.
510080	515040	Looking at the film's protagonist and her love interest, Lewis, played by Holly Shulerton,
515040	519120	I can't help but think that if this movie hadn't been distributed by the Daily Wire,
519120	522640	we'd be hearing cries of Mary Sue and forced diversity.
523200	526400	We'd probably hear some anger over all the villains being white too.
527360	531200	That is, if anyone would care about this movie to begin with.
531200	534800	Going back to the school shooters though, each of them is surprisingly uninteresting.
534800	536800	Anna is Tristan's girlfriend.
536800	539760	And that sums up her whole character.
539760	542720	Oh, and she smokes weed, I guess that's another thing.
546080	548960	Then we have Kip, played by Cyrus Arnold,
548960	552320	who fell under Tristan's sway because someone pulled his pants down
552320	554400	in front of the whole school a couple of years ago.
555040	560800	Kip has a baffling redemption arc where a two-minute talk from Zoe leads him to betraying Tristan.
560800	565360	He still ends up dying though, albeit so we can buy Zoe a few moments to escape a tight spot.
566000	569920	Most tragic though is Chris, played by Britain Seer.
569920	573680	He's Anna's brother, and apparently also romantically involved with Tristan.
573680	576800	I'm not sure how the dynamics of this relationship work,
576800	580960	but more importantly, Chris has some kind of severe mental health condition.
580960	583040	The movie never says what exactly,
583040	584880	though it seems like schizophrenia.
584880	590560	He's one of those characters who's less a character and more just a collection of walking symptoms.
590560	593280	And it makes him an easy tool to be used by Tristan,
593280	597680	until he's eventually shot by Zoe's father, played by Thomas Jane.
597680	601920	He was hanging around outside the school with a sniper rifle because that's what army dads do,
601920	602640	I guess.
602640	606320	Chris is easily one of the worst depictions of someone with a mental health condition.
606320	608400	I've seen in quite a while.
608400	611120	You might notice that all the antagonists are paper thin,
611120	613280	with weak or no motivations at all.
613280	615760	That's because a big part of this movie's intent,
615760	620240	according to the writer-director Kyle Rankin, was to not glamorize the shooter.
620240	623120	The fact that this movie could only shift the focus away from the shooter
623120	626800	by creating a completely artificial scenario that let a hero step in
626800	629760	speaks to how removed from reality this whole movie is.
629760	633920	Which is especially ironic because many of the positive reviews I've read for this movie,
633920	637760	and even comments in post-movie discussion, highlight the realism of it.
637760	640240	One of Zoe's early encounters with one of the shooters
640240	643840	is when Anna gets the drop on her as Zoe is trying to warn classrooms
643840	645600	about the shooting in the cafeteria.
645600	650560	Zoe is shot in the leg but still somehow manages to get the drop on Anna, turning her own gun on her.
650560	653680	The movie keeps going for a good 40 minutes after Zoe has been shot
653680	657280	as she runs around the school, takes down the other shooters, and saves her classmates.
657280	661360	A teacher at one point, instead of telling her student, who has a gunshot wound by the way,
661360	664000	to get to safety and maybe get medical attention,
664000	665920	instead goes with her on her mission.
665920	668320	Somehow this is meant to be realistic.
668320	670960	I think more likely the conservative audience,
670960	674640	obviously curated from the Daily Wire readers,
674640	678320	are seeing a version of reality they would rather was true,
678320	682160	instead of the more tragic reality of what happens at an actual school shooting.
682160	684000	But what I found most objectionable,
684000	688880	the part where this movie fully devolves into psycho-territory, happens in its final minutes.
688880	692720	It's a callback to the opening scene where we can see Zoe and her father hunting a deer.
692720	695200	The deer is mortally wounded but not killed,
695360	698800	and as Thomas Jane delivers a monologue about putting an animal out of its misery,
698800	702880	Zoe smashes a rock on the deer's head to reveal she is a troubled person,
702880	705040	still dealing with the recent death of her mother.
705040	708560	In the final moments of the movie, we find out Tristan has given the cops the slip,
708560	711120	and is slowly sneaking away from the scene of the crime.
711120	715680	Even though dozens of kids have seen his face and his only disguise is an orange baseball cap,
715680	717040	he nearly makes it out.
717040	718960	It's only Zoe who spots him.
719600	722880	Instead of telling the cops about it, she grabs her dad's rifle,
722880	726160	stalks Tristan, and then shoots him like a wild animal.
727200	729200	As he bleeds out, she walks towards him,
729200	733360	repeating her father's monologue from the first scene about putting an animal out of its misery,
733360	735760	but instead of smashing the rock on Tristan's head,
747040	750720	Zoe's transformation in this movie is to go from troubled teen and mourning,
750800	753920	pulling away from life, to the hero fully engaged with life,
753920	758000	who also happens to enjoy watching villains suffering a miserable death.
758000	761680	There's something disturbing and sadistic about an ending like this.
761680	765440	In the hands of a more competent filmmaker, the ending could have highlighted how even
765440	769200	being a hero in a school shooting creates a trauma that shatters all the good and
769200	770640	compassion out of a person.
770640	773600	The ending would be tragic, even if it seemed like justice.
773600	776800	But in this film, Zoe's path is presented as righteous,
776800	779520	and her growth is framed as something to be celebrated.
779520	783680	She's letting go of the pain of losing her mother and finding a reason to live in helping
783680	786240	people, but no one was helped in this final scene.
786240	789920	It was her needlessly doling out her own brand of justice.
789920	793920	Much like the death of Kip, who is on the path to redemption, the movie seems to be
793920	798960	operating under the idea that committing these crimes requires a swift punishment,
798960	800720	in this case, a death sentence.
802080	805680	It certainly falls in line with an earlier scene where a religious student,
805680	808400	who only speaks in this scene, has a moment with Tristan
809040	809520	Free will.
813440	815840	God allows the wicked to do their wickedness.
817360	818160	Oh yeah, why's that?
820240	821200	So they can be judged.
824080	830080	Tristan's death is supposed to be viewed as an act of justice, but to me it only reads tragically.
830080	833520	This movie, for all its errors of being popcorn entertainment,
833520	837120	with vague allusions to heroism in the face of tragedy,
837200	841760	can't escape the sad truth that, even in some kind of absurd power fantasy,
841760	847040	a school shooting will still end in tragedy, and the movie's veneer of justice being served
847040	850960	reveals a shallow excuse for how tragedies scar the survivors.
851520	856480	If this movie had been deliberately moving to this ending on that sour downbeat note,
856480	858000	it might have won me over.
858000	863040	But as it is, this feels like my reading attempting to salvage what is otherwise a
863040	864880	completely forgettable movie.
864880	867920	On the night of its North American premiere, after the movie's screened,
867920	871440	there was a short discussion with one of the movie's producers, Dallas Sonnier,
871440	873520	and the movie's writer and director, Kyle Rankin.
874080	877840	While watching the movie, one thing that was incredibly apparent was how shallow
877840	879600	the motivations were for the shooters.
879600	883680	In this conversation, we find out that's what drew Ben Shapiro to the movie in the first place.
883680	885440	We need to treat them for the villains they are.
885440	888880	It can't be all about, you know, their tough childhoods, as you were suggesting,
888880	892480	or the sort of crippling circumstances they went through, look how tough life is for them.
892480	892800	The film, actually.
892800	894720	The focus in this film is really on the victims.
894720	896160	It really, really is on the victim.
896160	899920	It's weird to hear that, because the focus isn't really on the victims at all.
899920	903520	Most of the victims are faceless students we never even learn the names of.
903520	906720	If we compare this movie to one of the earlier movies about school shootings,
906720	910640	Gus Van Sant's 2003 movie, Elephant, we see a dramatically different depiction
910640	911600	of a school shooting.
911600	914080	While both films take place during a single day,
914080	916960	Elephant spends time with over 10 different students,
916960	919520	and most of that time is spent with students who are victims.
919520	922000	My favorite example is the character Michelle.
922000	924800	There's something so incredibly sad about her scenes.
924800	927440	A quiet young girl who often fades into the background.
927440	929840	We don't see her do anything but go about her day,
929840	932160	keeping her head down while trying to get by.
932160	936240	There's one scene where two characters, John and Elias, meet in an empty hallway,
936240	938080	and Elias takes a picture of John.
938080	941040	Since the movie jumps around in the timeline events of the day,
941040	942880	we see this scene three times.
942880	947840	First from John's perspective, then Elias's, and then finally from Michelle's.
947840	950880	In the first two scenes, even though we've been introduced to Michelle already,
950960	955760	we don't even notice she appears in this moment until the focus shifts in that third scene.
955760	960720	It emphasizes that this is a character we don't see until we're directed towards her.
960720	965840	The only time in the movie someone sees Michelle pulling her face from the crowd
965840	968080	is in the library where she's helping out.
968880	971280	The person who sees her is one of the school shooters,
971280	974560	and we find out she's the first victim of the day.
974560	977200	Even though we know very little about the character,
977200	980720	the fact that we know so little reveals how little attention we pay
980720	983040	to the inner lives of teenagers in general.
983040	987440	The movie is making us consider that fact and how it might lead to people like the shooters,
987440	990800	and perhaps more importantly, to value the quiet people around
990800	995120	who we sadly let fade into the background unless they become the face of a tragedy.
995120	998560	We'll never know what kindness or compassion or beauty
998560	1000880	might have been within a character like Michelle.
1000880	1003200	And thanks to the shooters, we never will.
1004320	1005920	The moment where Michelle is killed
1005920	1008000	contains so much more tragedy and heartbreak
1008000	1010640	than the first teen killed in Run, Hide, Fight.
1010640	1014160	The first teen killed in Run, Hide, Fight is right here,
1014160	1015920	under the tire of the van.
1015920	1019440	Well, it's never really explained why the kid crawled under the van.
1019440	1023200	As we can see clearly in the previous shot, the van didn't run over anybody.
1023200	1024400	We don't know his name,
1024400	1026400	or the name of the girl who shot right after him,
1026400	1028480	or this guy who stabbed next.
1028480	1030640	They just die in an effort to raise the stakes.
1031200	1034320	This is a movie that focuses on some of the victims,
1034320	1037840	but clearly not all victims are considered equal.
1037840	1040160	The ones who fight back were remembered.
1040160	1042800	Those who don't, who might have died a death like Michelle,
1042800	1045440	are destined to be forgotten.
1045440	1047520	The Daily Wire crew also wants to highlight
1047520	1050960	how honest this movie is in its depiction of the shooters.
1050960	1054400	It has a more honest take on the people who perpetrate these crimes
1054400	1058720	than most even news articles or documentaries that you see.
1058720	1063440	It's trivially easy to explain how other movies that depict school shootings
1063440	1066000	provide more thoughtful depictions of the shooters.
1066000	1067440	I could highlight, for instance,
1067440	1071840	Il Marag's 2007 movie Class, where a bully befriends his victim
1071840	1074320	and their friendship fuels school hostilities,
1074320	1076160	leading them to murder their classmates.
1076160	1080240	Or I could talk about Matthew Johnson's 2013 movie The Dirties,
1080240	1083600	where a teenage boy's outsider status and obsession with movies
1083600	1086800	detach him from reality, eventually leading to tragedy.
1086800	1088880	Movies like these two make genuine attempts
1088880	1090880	to examine the psychology of school shooters
1090880	1094000	and the impact alienation from their peer group has on them.
1094000	1097280	Run, Hide, Fight gives us very little in the way of backstory
1097280	1099600	for any of the students, aside from Kip.
1099600	1102800	And in that case, it's used in a conversation that can redeem.
1102800	1105520	If anything, the film deliberately avoids this type of death
1105520	1107360	for its characters to prevent the audience
1107360	1109040	from feeling any sympathy for them.
1109040	1112240	Boring and Shapiro actually hit it on the head when they say this.
1112240	1116400	You really took kind of an unflinching look at the evil that you were saying, yeah.
1116400	1117760	With regard to the shooters,
1117760	1120640	this movie is trying to display the evil they represent
1120640	1124160	as something inherent and not the product of circumstances.
1124720	1128320	Again, echoing the statements of the religious character earlier on,
1128320	1132480	evil actions are permitted by God so that the evil-doers can be judged.
1132480	1135360	What made them evil to begin with is never considered.
1135360	1140240	This reminds me very much of a comment made during the 2008 American election.
1140240	1143360	The candidates at the time were Barack Obama and John McCain,
1143360	1145200	and they were both asked about evil.
1145200	1148960	Obama gave a long-winded response about understanding evil,
1148960	1150640	the actions we take to confront it,
1150640	1155840	and how trying to stop what we consider evil can have consequences we would also consider evil.
1155840	1159600	It's kind of convoluted, you can read it here if you're curious.
1159600	1163200	John McCain's response, though, was much more terse.
1163200	1167200	His response to what should be done about evil was to say, defeat it.
1167200	1171760	I think this represents two fundamentally different ways of looking at the concept of evil.
1171760	1173760	When the label is applied to a person,
1173760	1177760	Ben Shapiro, the rest of the Daily Wire crew, and the movie Run, Hide, Fight
1177760	1180080	clearly fall into the latter camp.
1180080	1184080	School shooters aren't meant to be something that can be understood or considered through art,
1184080	1189520	rather they present the opportunity for a simple morality tale of good, triumphing over evil.
1189520	1193680	One especially revealing part of the discussions that preceded and followed the premiere
1193680	1196480	is the victims the Daily Wire crew is most concerned with...
1197360	1198480	Conservatives.
1198480	1202480	They'll still let you watch their movies, of course, their TV shows, their news, their sports,
1202480	1205680	but you'll have to do it knowing that everyone who made that content,
1205760	1208240	at least everyone at the top, hates you.
1208240	1211440	Replacement institutions for all the institutions that hate our guts.
1211440	1215040	The left obviously wants to silence and remove voices that they don't agree with.
1215040	1218560	There are artists on left and right with talent who can express those visions,
1218560	1219680	but we're not allowed.
1219680	1223920	We've been, as conservatives, progressively locked out of every single institution, every single one.
1223920	1228320	This project to bring movies to their audience is fueled by the same victimhood mentality that
1228320	1232960	runs through all their work. The left controls everything and hates the right with a burning
1232960	1237600	passion. Of the five people representing the Daily Wire, Jeremy Boring, Andrew Clavin,
1237600	1242000	Michael Knowles, and Ben Shapiro all have unremarkable careers trying to make it in
1242000	1246320	the entertainment business. They are also convinced that the reasons they didn't make it
1246320	1250880	is because conservatives are forbidden into the halls of Hollywood.
1250880	1255360	While we could play the silly game of counting big conservative stars, such as Clint Eastwood,
1255360	1260000	it's probably better to look at the creative writing of Ben Shapiro and let that speak to why
1260000	1263600	he and possibly his buddies didn't make it too far in the world of Hollywood.
1264160	1268720	With the knowledge of their creative limitations and some obvious bitterness in their critique,
1268720	1273040	this whole endeavor has a different look to it. It seems less about providing entertainment to an
1273040	1276960	underserved audience, but rather an attempt to vindicate their own anger at the world of
1276960	1281360	Hollywood, fighting back with their own movies, created by conservatives.
1281360	1284480	It very much has a, we'll show them, vibe to it.
1285360	1288320	Although Kyle Rankin is vague about his political beliefs,
1288320	1291840	his producer, Dallas Sonnier, is less cagey about it.
1291840	1298800	I stayed the same. The world went left, right? I stayed here. And so I'm simply making the
1298800	1300080	movies that I grew up loving.
1300080	1303200	And when describing the movie, they seem fairly comfortable with it becoming
1303200	1305520	embraced by a conservative audience.
1305520	1313120	If the marketplace or the audience determines that the movie is more conservative in its values
1313120	1319200	or matrix or DNA, then so be it. That's fine with me.
1319200	1323840	And there's an attempt to frame this movie as enjoyable by a wider audience that presumably
1323840	1328800	doesn't just include conservatives. If so, it makes me wonder why the only way to see this movie
1328800	1333440	is to become a member on the Daily Wire website where you would have to pay $14 a month to watch
1333440	1339360	it. You also get access to some other Daily Wire content, but unless you're a fan of conservative
1339360	1344480	media, and likely a conservative yourself, there isn't much value in that monthly fee.
1344480	1349280	One thing it does do, though, is ensure that the audience for Run, Hide, Fight will be primed to
1349280	1355040	enjoy it. And not simply because they enjoy its quality, but because it's part of a grander project
1355040	1358000	of fighting back in the culture against the left.
1358000	1362080	Entertainment that you can not only enjoy, but be proud of knowing that you helped change the
1362080	1364320	culture. And ultimately, that's the key.
1364320	1368720	It also means the audience who determine the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB
1368720	1372480	are only coming from a conservative audience who have been primed to enjoy the movie,
1372480	1377360	and likely may be inflated. And negative reviews of the movie,
1377360	1381600	well, those are brushed off as being product of the extreme left.
1382240	1390000	The voices on the extreme left have not been open to the movie. In fact, they've been almost
1390000	1395600	resistant to it, reviewing when they review it. I don't want to ever single out an individual
1395600	1401120	review because I don't like it when filmmakers do that. But I saw a systemic
1402960	1410320	system in the reviews where it felt very much like a concerted effort to review the subject matter
1411040	1414720	and perceived politics rather than the actual movie.
1414720	1418480	I can understand the assumption that once The Daily Wire became involved,
1418480	1422320	the way critics look at this movie would be altered. Heck, I wouldn't be reviewing this
1422320	1425760	movie at all had I not read the story about The Daily Wire's connection to it.
1425760	1431600	But to brush off negative criticisms as coming from the extreme left, who are ignoring the
1431600	1437040	quality of the movie, is absolutely not true. I read every single review of this movie when
1437040	1441600	it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September of 2020. That's right, I read
1442240	1447840	all seven of them. Of those seven, six were negative. Jessica Kiang wrote,
1447840	1453280	At literally no point in this weirdly lumbering, sluggish movie's narrative does its grotesque,
1453280	1459120	tastelessness ever appear to have occurred to anyone involved. David Ehrlich wrote,
1459120	1463920	It's a movie made by someone who's seen too many movies and now made at least one too many as well.
1464560	1469840	And from Guy Lodge, What would you do? The film tastelessly needles its viewers throughout,
1469840	1473280	presenting the brawniest, most impossible answer all the while.
1474000	1477920	These reviews do make note of the subject matter, because how could you not,
1477920	1483200	but only in the context of how the film depicts it. The one positive review came from Christian
1483200	1488960	Toto. If there is a message here, it's an honest, unblinking one. Some children are broken as they
1488960	1495200	near adulthood, a tragic lesson we've learned from real life headlines. Question as to why those
1495200	1500240	children are broken, though, is for superior movies. This one just wants us to celebrate
1500240	1505600	another child murdering them. There's a Hunger Games vibe here. It's not just that Isabel May
1505600	1510960	looks a bit like Jennifer Lawrence. It's that we in the audience are very much like the detached,
1510960	1517120	rich elites who watch teenagers kill each other. At least we aren't doing it for real. We're doing
1517120	1523040	it in movies inspired by real life events. In a brief behind the scenes documentary for the movie,
1523040	1527680	many of the cast members shared their opinions that this movie might be positively read as a
1527680	1532800	call to action. Not for any sort of political action, of course. Instead, it's to possibly
1532800	1539200	inspire someone who might face a similar situation to fight back. If we become more proactive,
1539200	1545040	and it does take a little bit of bravery, it doesn't mean you can't be scared, but to act
1546160	1552800	proactively is going to save lives. That's a recommendation that's so depressing. I can only
1552800	1556400	hope they were desperately trying to find something constructive to say, and hadn't
1556400	1561280	had more than a few moments to think about it. To be clear, I bear no ill will to any actor,
1561280	1565600	or even some of the crew who are involved in the making of this movie. Everyone's gotta earn a
1565600	1570960	living somehow, and sometimes you sign up for a movie not necessarily knowing how it's going to
1570960	1576400	turn out. One particular plot point, or lack thereof, was an explanation as to where these
1576400	1582160	teenagers got hold of so many guns. They had two pistols, a shotgun, and a machine gun. The machine
1582160	1587920	gun is an MP40, which is what the Germans used during World War II. A not-so-subtle reminder
1587920	1593840	that these are the bad guys. The absence of any explanation for where these guns came from seems
1593840	1599760	to me like an absolute refusal to even speak to the gun culture of the United States. Everyone
1599760	1605680	has guns, even relics from World War II. This is just a fact of life. And the idea that teenagers
1605680	1611200	who want to shoot up a school, perhaps, just perhaps, shouldn't be able to put together a
1611200	1616400	cache of weapons is never really explored. The idea that there might be a problem with the gun
1616400	1621680	culture of the United States is just one more thing this film does not want us thinking about.
1621680	1626400	It's ironic hearing the writer, director, or producer, anyone involved with this movie
1626400	1632480	talking about wanting to start a conversation or dialogue when this film seems entirely uninterested
1632480	1638960	in presenting even the most basic starting point for a discussion. It was probably best summed up
1639040	1642880	by, of all people, Matt Walsh. When following the screening, he said this.
1653360	1659920	The idea of a school shooting being fodder for escapism is a creepy thought. It makes something
1659920	1666560	that should be upsetting by the nature of its rarity seem commonplace and regular and normal.
1666560	1672160	It does nothing to even broach the hard questions of why school shootings happen.
1672160	1676800	Presenting them is something we should turn our brains off for. It does make heroes out of the
1676800	1681360	victims, though only those who stand and fight against their fellow classmates. It's an ugly
1681360	1687280	burden to put on teenagers, and one made especially ugly by the movie's embrace of national tragedies.
1687840	1693840	What we have is a movie that exploits a tragedy to make a cheesy action film,
1693840	1695920	and it doesn't really do much more than that.
1697040	1701840	Okay, I need to stop the video right here, right now, for a content warning. I'm going to be
1701840	1707680	discussing some of the history of the studio that worked on this movie, including some stories
1707680	1712880	involving animal cruelty and sexual assault. If you're not down for that, feel free to dip out
1712880	1720160	of the video now. For those who are sticking around, get ready, because things are about to get dark.
1720880	1725920	This film was produced by a company named Bonfire Legends, though originally it went under a
1725920	1731280	different banner, Sinistate. A studio with a number of films under its belt, articles about
1731280	1736480	them describe Sinistate as producing low-budget features for a more conservative audience,
1736480	1740720	although the company's founder and owner, Dallas Sonnier, resists that characterization,
1740720	1745840	as he feels his movies are apolitical, which is what conservatives happen to want. Speaking to
1745840	1750560	the Wall Street Journal, he said, if we can make a movie that does not treat them as losers or ask
1750560	1755200	how dare they vote a certain way or pander to them, naturally they're going to respond in a
1755200	1759360	positive way. Originally Run, Hide, Fight was supposed to launch Sinistate's new
1759360	1764720	Rebelor brand, though between the announcement of these plans in early 2020 and the present day in
1764720	1770240	2021, things radically changed. The major controversy to hit the studio was regarding
1770240	1775760	one of its producers, Adam Donaghy. Donaghy joined Sinistate in 2017, working as a line
1775760	1782240	producer and executive producer on the films The Standoff at Sparrow Creek, VFW, and Satanic Panic.
1782240	1787200	He was also one of the executive producers on Run, Hide, Fight, before his name was taken off
1787200	1792800	the film a few months before its premiere. In late April of 2020, Donaghy was arrested
1792800	1798240	for the sexual assault of a 16-year-old girl. Following this revelation, a number of allegations
1798240	1803280	regarding sexual harassment became known to the wider public, revealing that this was a well-known
1803280	1808320	secret within the local Dallas film scene. One of them included a conversation recorded by
1808320	1813440	Kristen Leah Haynes from 2014, where she was working in the art department of the film
1813440	1819280	Occupy Texas. At the time, she was 21 years old. In the recording, we can hear Donaghy proposition
1819280	1824640	Haynes asking to see her underwear and then asking for her to participate in sexual acts.
1824640	1828960	The recording and Donaghy's reputation were spread throughout the local film community. There
1828960	1833840	are multiple stories of him aggressively touching or propositioning women on film sets, and he rarely
1833840	1838560	seemed to face much in the way of consequences. The problem with Donaghy was that he was a line
1838560	1843440	producer, meaning he was in charge of budgeting for the film. He also, in many cases, served as
1843440	1848880	a source of financing for films. He was literally writing the checks of his would-be accusers.
1848880	1854080	And in cases where his actions were brought up to others, they were often minimized or dismissed.
1854080	1858400	In 2017, Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmick began partnering with Donaghy.
1858400	1862800	In an article by The Daily Beast, 10 people claimed to have directly reached out to the
1862800	1867440	heads of Sinistate, Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmick, with four of them offering the audio
1867440	1872240	that Haynes have recorded. Each of these people who approached Sonnier and Presmick said that
1872240	1877440	their reports fell on deaf ears. Both the producers claimed to have never heard the recording,
1877440	1882000	and Sonnier admonished Haynes for not making her report through official channels.
1882000	1886240	When asked about the allegations against his studio, Sonnier said he was largely unaware of
1886240	1888560	them. Sonnier told The Daily Beast,
1888560	1893040	We're under siege right now. Everyone involved has their own personal vendettas against us.
1893040	1897600	They have a history of harassing us and having problems with us. It feels like a targeted hit,
1897600	1901680	and it feels like an attack. I think people have real issues with us. They have issues with our
1901680	1906160	success with the amount of movies we've made and in a short time built this company to be something
1906240	1911440	very special. It feels partisan. When the allegations went public in mid-2020,
1911440	1916720	two of the publications Sinistate owned, Fangoria and Birth Movies Death, parted ways with the
1916720	1921440	company. In an interview with Kyle Rankin, the writer and director of Run, Hide, Fight, he
1921440	1926880	responded to learning about the Donaghy situation, saying, I was blown away. When the news broke,
1926880	1931200	it was sad and shocking. I believed Sinistate that they didn't know about Adam's past,
1931200	1934880	and that they were working hard to restructure their company and have very safe sets.
1934880	1938560	I knew that I ran a very safe set. I knew my side of the street was clean.
1938560	1940800	I thought I could stick around and affect some change.
1941360	1945120	Though there are no direct allegations of sexual harassment on the set of a movie,
1945120	1948960	concerns surrounding the production have been raised. Speaking to the Daily Beast,
1948960	1953600	the film's second assistant director, Kristen Leah Haynes, the woman who recorded Donaghy
1953600	1958000	sexually harassing her, said she joined the production as a favor to a friend and because
1958000	1962800	she needed the work. She said, there was some really sketchy s*** going on on that movie.
1963440	1969040	Haynes, who was only on set a few days, was also assured that she would be kept far from Donaghy.
1969040	1973120	Several of the staff walked off the set of the movie, including the first assistant director,
1973120	1976480	Meg Beatty, and key hair and makeup artist, Madeline Rose.
1977040	1982000	In Rose's case, she mentions the reason for her departure had to do with the film's opening scene,
1982000	1986640	where we see Zoe and her father hunting a deer. What bothered Rose about this scene was that this
1986640	1992160	was no special effect. This was a very real deer that was shot on camera for the movie.
1992160	1997440	She describes it. They hired a local hunter, went on his land, and filmed the deer being shot.
1997440	2001120	Then they took the deer and froze it so they could pull it out again for close-ups with
2001120	2006800	the actual actors. In the Daily Beast article, Sonia claims it was the legal harvest of a
2006800	2011520	registered buck, and that SAG-AFTRA took no issue with the incident.
2012320	2017600	Rose voiced her concerns over the deer to Donaghy, and she describes the encounter saying,
2017600	2022400	He went off on me in a very condescending way. He got very heated and told me I was either with
2022400	2028960	them or against them. Rose, who had been unfamiliar with the earlier allegations against Donaghy,
2028960	2034080	quit the film the following day. Although the deer incident was unknown to the Daily Wire crew
2034080	2038800	when they purchased the rights to distribute this movie, Jeremy Boring did speak to knowing
2038800	2043440	about the incidents regarding Donaghy, having read the earlier Daily Beast article describing
2043440	2048880	the history of sexual harassment and assault on sets Donaghy had worked on. Boring said,
2048880	2053680	To the extent that things may have taken place in the production of this film or another film,
2054240	2058640	I don't think it's my business. In the same way, it's not my business if something takes place at
2058640	2063440	any other kind of company that I buy product from. I'm sure there have been allegations of sexual
2063440	2067360	harassment at almost every major product company in the country. That doesn't mean the product
2067360	2071680	itself has to be banned. Those things, to the extent that anything did happen,
2072320	2077440	didn't happen under my watch. The Daily Wire's first foray into the world of entertainment
2077440	2081520	is to ensure that the North American audience will get the chance to see a movie that would
2081520	2086160	have likely gone straight to video on demand. Only instead of appearing on Stars or Hulu,
2086160	2091600	Run, Hide, Fight is on the same streaming platform as video podcasts of Ben Shapiro
2091600	2094000	complaining about the Babysitter's Club show on Netflix.
2101680	2115120	And that seems like the perfect place for this movie.
2117920	2122240	I'm honestly surprised at how much I had to say about this movie. When I watched it,
2122240	2127360	it was surprisingly uninteresting. And when I watched it again the following day,
2127360	2131760	I was amazed at how much I had forgotten. It's surprisingly unmemorable as a movie.
2132320	2138000	Not even in a so bad it's amusing way, it's just sort of whatever. Your life will not have been
2138000	2143360	enriched in any way for having watched it. One thing I didn't cover in the video were the
2143360	2148880	horrible working conditions for a lot of its crew members, often paid very low wage, and they were
2148880	2155360	often asked to work very long hours. There was another incident where an older actor was
2155360	2161440	considered too expensive to replace when after he sexually harassed some women in the makeup
2161440	2166800	department, including trying to grope one of them. According to one of the people involved,
2166800	2174160	Sonya's response was to suggest that the women start using the buddy system to avoid being groped.
2174160	2177600	There were other stories of people who hadn't gone on the record and that were tougher to source,
2177600	2181520	but overall they seemed like a pretty shady company, in other words a perfect fit for the
2181520	2187040	daily wire. I want to thank all my lovely patrons and members whose names are scrolling up on the
