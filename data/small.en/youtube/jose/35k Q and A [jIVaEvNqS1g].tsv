0	5920	Hey everyone, welcome to my 35,000 subscriber special video. The game plan for this video
5920	11760	is to watch the special bonus video that was unlocked by my patrons over on Patreon. Then
11760	17040	I'll be announcing some fun new rewards for people who decide to join my Patreon,
17040	21040	and then we'll have a very lengthy Q&A with way too many questions.
21600	28640	And now let's watch that classic Jose episode from back in 2017 where I decided to discuss
28640	35680	the scourge of ironic Nazis. A few notes before we start the video. Number one, the audio is
36320	42800	very bad. Very, very bad. I almost recorded the whole thing again, but I feel like that kind of
42800	48320	loses the whole point of it being an old video. You'll also be able to tell that my style is a
48320	54480	bit different. Overall, I think the video actually holds up. Also, I say the word ironic very
54480	60080	strangely inside it. I wasn't actually trying for an accent back then. It was just trying to
60080	67760	imitate a funnier podcast that I had seen in the past. Enjoy and brace yourself for the audio.
68880	72560	Lately, there's been an outbreak of a certain type of jokesters on YouTube.
73280	78560	People who love getting a rise out of others by adopting vocabulary, attitudes, imagery,
78560	83600	and music of history's most playful, silly authoritarian regime, the Third Reich.
84480	91360	It's almost like we've gone back to the 1930s. Nazis invade your cult. Wait, excuse me,
92160	98080	ironic Nazis. Because nowadays it seems like it can't be a real Nazi unless you're literally
98080	102480	throwing someone into an oven. And even then someone might ask if they deserved it or not.
103440	109840	But let's pretend what we've mostly gotten is an outbreak of the ironic Nazis. People who love
109840	116000	living well past the edge of good taste and revel in schlocky shock humor. A few commentators have
116000	121120	pointed out this trend already, but as someone who likes telling stories, I wanted to try relating
121120	128960	one of my own as a cautionary tale, and we have to start an unlikely place. This is Bon Jovi.
128960	136720	That's right. Drink it in. When Bon Jovi isn't culturally appropriate in cigarette
136720	140720	advertising for their albums, they're producing the rock albums that have kept them relevant
140720	146320	for a decade. Throughout their 30-year career, they've had to weather some tough criticisms,
146320	150560	namely the one my friends and I came up with 10 years ago when we concluded that Bon Jovi
150560	157840	is the most generic rock band in history. So we began to mock them. Started off with
157840	162560	some sneering and jokes at their expense. But being the sophisticated cats we were,
162560	169600	we eventually moved on to the much sharper tool of belittling them. We became ironic Bon Jovi fans.
170720	176480	With that move, we entered a golden age of comedy. There's no line that could not be crossed,
176480	183040	no bar that could not be topped. When someone said Bon Jovi's music retroactively became the best
183120	188160	music of the 1950s, someone had to correct them and say Bon Jovi's sweet sounds are the reason
188160	197200	we evolved to have ears. There were no limits. And we kept going deeper. We were buying Bon Jovi
197200	203360	albums, learning the lyrics to their music, and even went to one of their concerts. I remember
203360	207840	by the end of that night, we were hoarse from singing along to living on a prayer. The concert
207840	215760	came to an end. Or in other words, we actually had a lot of fun. And maybe it was because of
215760	221200	that fun that we sort of realized something that night. We realized that our ironic performance
221200	228640	had taken us so far that we had, in fact, become Bon Jovi fans. I went from the guy who sneered at
228640	234800	their music to the one who sings at least one Bon Jovi song every time on that karaoke. I went
234800	239200	from changing the station when they were on to memorizing their lyrics to more songs than I
239200	245760	really feel comfortable admitting in public. I had become and have become the thing I was pretending
245760	252720	to be. Now, my little ironic Nazis, you may be saying to yourself, you would never go so far as
252720	257600	to become an actual Nazi. My analogy is silly, and I should guess myself. I might have said
257600	262560	something similar in my early days of being an ironic Bon Jovi fan. But here's an interesting
262560	268880	point to consider. I am not, and will never likely be so silly as to think our ears evolve
268880	274400	to listen to the music of Bon Jovi. While I am always down to sing, wanted, dead, or alive,
274400	279120	I don't feel the need to see Bon Jovi whenever they're in town either. In other words,
279120	285120	my Jovi fandom is the mild sort of casual fan, which is a far cry from the super fandom I
285120	290480	pretended. Think to yourself, there's all this good-natured memeing around led you to start
290480	295920	believing some new ideas you had never considered. Perhaps you find yourself talking about how
295920	301360	multiculturalism can only fail, and ethnic homogeneity is essential to keep society
301360	305840	functioning. Perhaps you're starting to think that there are some cultures that are barbaric
305840	310960	or so morally reprehensible that anyone from said culture must be regarded with suspicion
310960	316800	or kept away at all costs. No doubt you have rationalizations for your new ideas,
317600	323600	that they're not as bad as Nazism, and that might even be true. But do you wonder why they sound
323600	332400	so similar? Is it possible your ironic Nazism is gradually turning into a soft Nazism? I hope
332400	337440	people who draped themselves in the colors of some of history's worst monsters stop and ask
337440	343600	themselves what all that pretending means and where it might take them. If you're finding your
343600	348480	moral development is being increasingly informed by a group of people you know is repulsive,
349440	353600	maybe you need to start asking yourself what you really believed in the first place.
354960	361200	This video isn't designed to be an accusation. I'm staring away from calling out any ideologies
361200	367120	that have been conflated with Nazism on purpose to focus on how some people like to deploy Nazi
367120	372880	themes for a laugh instead. I'm just hoping people will perhaps stop and think about what they're
372880	378960	doing and saying. I know that's not very popular when we all look to YouTube personalities to do
378960	387280	thinking for us, but maybe they don't always have the answers. And no, I'm actually not trying to be
387280	392480	an ironic YouTuber myself. You can tell me how wrong I am without resorting to name calling
392480	399040	and spamming memes. I'd at least be relieved you're thinking for yourself, even if you are wrong.
400000	406240	At the end of my journey into irony, I ended up the fan of a rock band known for catchy music and
406240	413040	simple lyrics. What will you end up with at the end of yours? And I feel like we need to end on
413040	420000	the words of a great poet. Take a look around you. Nothing's what it seems. We're living in the
420000	427120	broken home of hopes and dreams. Let me be the first to shake a helping hand. Anybody brave enough
427200	433280	to take a stand. I've knocked on every door and every dead end street. Looking for forgiveness
433280	447040	what's left to be. I hope you all enjoyed that rewatching it. It actually held up better than
447040	452720	I thought it would for a little six minute video. It's not too bad. And I am 100% comfortable with
452720	457760	everyone knowing that I'm a Bon Jovi fan. I can live with this. Now let's get on to the new
457760	464240	patron rewards. I have two types of rewards that will now be available on my Patreon. The first is
464240	470800	an exclusive download of my theme song. I'll have some more details on the background of this song
470800	475920	in the Q&A since some people asked about it. But if you've ever wanted a copy of your own to listen
475920	480880	to this will be your chance and if you're worried about the artist who happens to be a friend of
480880	487520	mine she'll be getting a percentage of the first month of your donation and if you really want to
487520	492000	give her a little bit extra just leave a note when you become one of my patrons and say give this
492000	498160	extra money to your lovely singer. The second new reward is one that's being used by a lot of other
498160	503840	people so it's not quite as fun or creative but it will be super useful at least to me. And that's
503840	510400	letting patrons see videos a few days early. I kind of resisted this one because I would prefer
510400	515120	everyone seeing a video at the same time with no one getting preferential treatment but I'm
515120	520320	actually viewing these releases as something of a test case. So what I'm hoping for is that my
520320	525760	patrons will offer me some early feedback letting me edit and modify and just fix up any small
525760	531440	mistakes that appear in videos so when the final version comes out it'll be nice and not filled
531440	537440	with any silly mistakes. And if you're wondering what new expensive tier all of this will be for
537440	543600	the answer is no new tier. Both of these new rewards are being added to the five dollar tier.
543600	546640	Of course if you'd like to give me more than that that's always an option
547280	551280	but there won't be any additional rewards for it at least not for the time being.
551840	557920	Now it's time for the Q&A. The first question comes from overrunpatreon from one of my patrons
557920	564880	Liz Castro. She writes, Congrats! I am curious given the breadth of your research for your videos
564960	569440	were you involved in academia or publishing prior to becoming a youtube creator?
569440	574160	I myself am a teacher and thoroughly appreciate your attention to detail and conscientious
574160	581280	citations. I'm trying to maintain a degree of anonymity here so I won't discuss my professional
581280	587040	life too much but before that I was enrolled in university and have a background in both
587040	592160	english and psychology. I had a double major in my undergrad years. I considered going into a
592160	597360	master's program but for a number of reasons it just wasn't a good option for me. I've always
597360	602800	had a healthy respect for academia and very much appreciate the process and the effort people go
602800	609040	to to make sure their work is properly cited and grounded in appropriate sources. If that's
609040	613520	reflected in my work I'm glad that people are noticing that. A number of questions were asked
613520	618720	on my youtube channel so I am going to go through those in the order that they were asked.
618720	624080	First is, I have a question. What are your thoughts on Balkan politics and will you make
624080	630320	video on it? I assume this is from a viewer in the Balkans and I have to admit I don't know a
630320	635440	lot about Balkan politics. I believe I would have to spend a lot of time researching and learning
635440	640560	about it and to be honest I probably won't ever get around to doing something like that mostly
640560	645600	because this is something that would take years to do if I was going to do it properly and one of my
645680	650720	pet peeves on youtube is seeing people talk about things that they know little or nothing about.
650720	655280	I never want to be one of those people. Next question, are you friends with any right-wing
655280	661840	people? Yes in fact I have a couple of friends who are rather right-wing including family members
661840	667200	and that's always interesting when politics comes up. Thankfully none of the right-wing people I know
667200	673360	have especially noxious or terrible opinions so there's never been too much trouble. I'll share
673360	678160	our brief story. About a month ago I had some family visiting from out of town and they came
678160	684720	and they wanted to do something festive in the city so my idea was to go to a special pop-up bar
684720	690240	that had a christmas theme here in Toronto. It was a fun time. It was all fancy and dressed up
690240	695040	and they had specialty cocktails and we were all having a little fun. Later that evening there was
695040	699680	going to be a show though and one of the people who worked there went around was letting everyone
699680	704000	know there'd be a show that night. Of course I knew about it and I was just waiting to see
704000	709600	my cousin's reaction because when the staff member came by and said it would be a drag show
709600	718480	his eyes just popped out of his head and he was like a drag show? And I just couldn't stop laughing
718480	723680	it was probably my favorite part of the whole night. Okay next question, do you feel any sort
723680	729120	of pressure to hide any opinions you have because of fear of losing fans slash patrons? Even if you
729120	734640	don't do it do you at least consider it? Let me first address patrons. My patrons are actually
734640	740000	surprisingly quiet. If you go over to my patreon you'll see there aren't that many comments and I
740000	745600	get almost no messages from my patrons. I actually kind of like that they have this silent support
745600	750240	for me and I appreciate it. I do hope they're a bit more vocal when it comes time to offering
750240	755280	me some feedback for early videos before they go live but other than that I appreciate having
755280	760560	supporters who are willing to financially back my work without trying to influence it or push it
760560	766080	too much one way or another. With regard to the YouTube audience as a whole and any pressure I
766080	771760	feel from them I think pretty much any YouTube creator will feel a degree of pressure one way
771760	777760	or the other when it comes to certain types of opinions. That said when I look at the reactions
777760	783840	from my audience they're usually pretty positive and I feel as though if I go in a certain direction
783840	789360	that maybe they aren't used to and or don't expect I generally receive support more often
789360	795360	than not and I've never gone about making any particular video thinking I'm not sure people
795360	800400	will appreciate this or this is a topic I shouldn't touch because it might annoy my audience. If
800400	805120	anything I feel like I'm rewarded for taking chances like that. When my channel really blew up
805120	810800	with that Roseanne video that was me taking a chance because I wasn't sure anyone wanted to
810800	817360	listen to me talk about a sitcom from the 1980s and 90s and it turns out they did and the lesson
817360	822400	I learned is it's good to take chances and try and make something even if you think your audience
822400	827040	might not be down for it. That said there are moments when I'm making videos and I cut out
827040	831680	certain lines and certain terms of phrase sometimes in sire sections usually because I
831680	836480	think it'll be bad and people will think that's boring or uninteresting sometimes I'm worried
836480	841040	about things being a little too mean a little too gruff when I look at the reactions from my
841040	846560	audience I like the warm positive ones rather than the sort of angry positive ones if that makes
846560	852080	sense and I'm trying to be aware of the audience I'm cultivating and I don't ever want it to be one
852080	858880	where I feel like I am fearful of them fearful of losing viewers or patrons and if I feel myself
858880	864160	moving in that direction I'll feel as though I'm doing something wrong and right now at least I
864160	870960	don't feel like I'm quite in that space next question are you a socialist a sockdam or just a
870960	876960	liberal well definitely not just a liberal so we can cross that off the list I tend to think of
876960	884240	politics in two different ways the practical reality of electoral politics and the broader
884240	889760	ideology that informs my vision of how I would like the world to be so when it comes to practical
889760	895520	politics and trying to implement policies I tend to act as a social democrat if an election is up
895520	900560	I will vote for the candidate who will represent policies that will move the country further to
900560	907680	the left I know it's not perfect and some people get frustrated that politicians are lagging behind
907680	912560	where they would like the left to be in the mainstream but I think small improvements are
912560	917040	better than no improvements and I think there's a real danger of sitting out in elections because
917040	921520	they have consequences even if they don't affect you other people are affected by these policies
921520	925440	and we owe it to one another to always try and make the world a better place when we have the
925440	931520	opportunity as for the long-term goals you could probably say I'm closer to a socialist
932160	936960	generally speaking I try not to be tied down to any sort of specific ideology and we have to be
936960	941360	aware that there are going to be changes and shifts to our society that will make frameworks
941360	946880	we have today not quite or not necessarily applicable to that much different tomorrow
947520	951600	like climate change that was something that has to be accommodated into any sort of framework we're
951600	955120	going to have for the future and who knows what other sorts of challenges might lie ahead of us
956480	964320	next question do you hobby bird watching you like birds I've actually never gone bird watching
964320	970560	as for liking birds yes I do like birds I don't have any specific affinity towards birds believe
970640	977120	it or not I actually love all animals so birds are also animals and are great next question
977760	983280	what is your take on veganism and animal agriculture I am actually a vegetarian and
983280	988080	have been for about a year and a half now it's been surprisingly easy because I was never a huge
988080	993200	meat eater to begin with so cutting it out was relatively simple although it's sometimes tough
993200	999360	to eat out which is a bit frustrating veganism is great I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it that far
999360	1005600	I'd like to there is a version of animal agriculture that can be done humanely and without
1005600	1010880	cruelty and in a way might need to be done for certain domesticated animals that can't live in
1010880	1016240	the wild anymore that said that's not what we have at all and animals are really horribly treated
1016800	1022000	well I'm not about to go around slapping burgers out of people's hands I would recommend you know
1022000	1026800	if you do eat meat maybe cut down a little bit not just for the sake of the animals but also
1026800	1032080	the environment it has a pretty hefty toll lots of great channels out there can explain it better
1032080	1038240	than I can next question would you rather French kiss a poodle or cuddle a wild raccoon I assume
1038240	1044160	these are both consensual things because I would do neither if the animal wasn't up for it so I
1044160	1049760	probably go with cuddle wild raccoon because I think it would be weird to open mouth kiss a dog
1050640	1057680	next question what prompted you to start this channel I saw a increasing amount of reactionary
1057680	1062080	content on YouTube and it was really starting to annoy me so I wanted to push back against that
1062080	1066960	honestly for a while I wasn't sure if I was capable of doing something like this but considering the
1066960	1073840	caliber of the opposition really anyone can debunk some of this garbage that's spewed out there
1073840	1078320	and from there I've just been experimenting and trying new things and building a channel that's
1078320	1083600	got some cool different stuff on it now next what do you think is going to stop people from
1083600	1090560	falling for demagogues um nothing I think demagogues are always going to be an issue and always a
1090560	1096400	problem as for what people can do there are some general tips and advice and that's to try and be
1096400	1102240	as educated as possible when it comes to listen to a passionate speaker ask yourself the question
1102240	1107440	if this is something they're so passionate about and I'm so passionate about why am I simply sitting
1107440	1112400	here letting this person educate me when I could go out there and use my passion for this subject
1112400	1118400	to educate myself and you might find that this person who speaks with such passion is actually
1118400	1124880	full of crap and you just ID'd a demagogue congratulations next your profile picture looks
1124880	1130640	like a blue jay correct me if I'm wrong why did you choose this it is a blue jay and why I chose
1130640	1135920	this was actually pretty random I drew this picture back when I started my channel I had actually been
1135920	1140720	trying to teach myself to draw for about a year or two when I drew that and it was actually my
1140720	1145760	first time trying to draw a blue jay and my first time ever digitally coloring anything and when I
1145760	1150320	made my channel I knew I wasn't just going to take a picture of my face I wanted to have some
1150320	1156320	graphic or image and I was really worried about taking someone else's so I just took this picture
1156320	1161360	which was mine and I thought it was pretty cute and I figured what the heck I'll use it I originally
1161360	1164880	had it as part of the name of this channel but I got rid of that pretty quickly and just switched
1164880	1171360	the name to Jose because that's so much easier next what's your favorite animated film Princess
1171360	1177040	Mononoke which is actually my favorite movie entirely uh maybe I'll do a video about it someday
1177040	1184160	who knows which languages do you speak English a little bit of French but it gets worse every year
1184160	1190800	because I never use it and I understand some Spanish usually just when someone is yelling at me
1190800	1195680	next what do you think of Jordan Peterson's 12 rules for life I have not read it the only
1195680	1203360	familiarity I have with it is I watch the videos by Hannah and Jake discussing it it seems kind of
1203360	1210560	dopey and a cheap way to smuggle in some Christianity into people's lives I don't really like self-help
1210560	1216960	books and I like religious self-help books even less probably gonna skip this one what's an example
1216960	1223360	of a movie that you think is really underrated I wish I had really cool unique tastes in movies
1223360	1228880	but I don't really maybe Children of Men I feel like that's a movie that was a big deal when it
1228880	1235040	came out but then just got quickly forgotten stars Clive Owen in a post-apocalyptic future
1235760	1240560	where no new children are being born it's really good do you ever plan on doing live
1240560	1247440	streams or debate discussions with people on the other side no not in any time in the near future
1247440	1254240	most people on the other side I'm gonna be totally honest I don't think approach live streams or
1254240	1260880	these debate discussions in a way that's helpful I don't just mean the people who are adversarial
1260880	1265600	and see it as an attempt to just dunk on the other side and try and make someone look like
1265600	1271760	a fool in real time even if someone comes in good faith to have a genuine discussion or debate
1271760	1277600	I don't think they're gonna become armed with enough research or material to make it worthwhile
1277600	1283280	you'd basically see me show up with as much as I could find speaking to someone who will just pivot
1283280	1289680	ignore and shoot out talking points and it would be a waste of time I feel like it would be easier
1289680	1294960	just to respond to their videos because at least then I don't have someone changing the subject
1294960	1300160	just as I get going on something because they realize they have no response to anything I'm
1300160	1305840	bringing up or at least I won't have to deal with responses that are completely incongruent with what
1305840	1312480	I'm saying will you are you planning on doing more videos about comics yes definitely I was
1312480	1317840	actually supposed to have a comic book related video in either late December early January
1317840	1322320	I got about two-thirds the way through the script when I realized I wasn't saying anything new or
1322320	1326800	interesting I was just looking for an excuse to talk about a certain Avengers comic I still might
1326800	1333200	do it in the future if I can find a more worthwhile bit of commentary I don't want to just create
1333200	1338000	videos for the sake of creating videos I want it to be a little more worthwhile as far as big videos
1338000	1343440	like the Secret Empire one oof I'd need to find another big event I'd want to cover like that
1343440	1348400	again although it was kind of fun featuring all those different voices in there and having a
1348400	1353520	really big video discussing comics I might do that again in the future we'll see congrats on
1353520	1359840	35k Jose have you ever thought about making a video on gamer gate like you did on comics gate
1359840	1366480	keep up the good work yes I have I kind of want to do this it's going to be an enormous project and
1366480	1372800	it's going to be painful it'll be more of a an autopsy I guess because gamer gate's pretty dead
1372800	1379280	right now right it's it's dead huh I hope so what's your hottest take ooh good question
1379920	1385200	one day I might have to do a video about how Batman is terrible and there are almost no good
1385200	1390320	Batman stories and as I say that as someone who has read a lot of them it's not even the usual
1390320	1396800	like ooh Batman's a fascist he's a rich white male he's actually a conservative dream libertarian
1396800	1404560	etc etc no I just think a lot of Batman stories suck and they just read like fan fiction because
1404560	1409920	most writers are fans of Batman even if you are atheistic what's your favorite deity
1410800	1417120	that is a good good question I always thought Poseidon was really cool Greek god of the sea
1417120	1422240	he always seemed to get downplayed a little in most stories about Greek mythology people are
1422240	1428880	more interested in Zeus or Aries maybe Athena but why not Poseidon he's got the whole ocean
1428880	1433520	the ocean's pretty neat next question what method do you believe would be effective in showing
1433520	1438560	progressives that they are becoming the tea party of the left first of all you're assuming I buy
1438560	1445360	into that premise the tea party for those who don't know was a very right-wing group that emerged in
1445360	1452800	conservative politics in 2009 2010 thereabouts it was very much a response to the election of
1452800	1457600	Barack Obama but it was supposedly more about the out of control spending and the massive debt
1457600	1462560	deficit as for the comparisons to the tea party I can see what people are saying and that it seems
1462560	1467840	to be on the extreme left of the spectrum I think pushing for their left is actually a good thing
1467840	1473360	when it comes to certain tactics though there is something to be said about elements on the left
1473360	1479360	that give the left a bad name and really the difficulty is finding a way to criticize that
1479360	1484400	in a way that isn't helpful to the right and becoming a useful idiot like Tim Poole or Dave
1484400	1490640	Rubin I'm actually working on a video it's still just a germ of an idea and I'm just not sure the
1490640	1496160	best way of doing this but a video on how to critique the left in a way that will make it
1496160	1502240	better rather than just try and tear it down like some secret right-wing operative if you want to
1502240	1507520	see a good example of that Mexy actually had a video about that I the name is blanking on me at
1507520	1512000	the moment but I'll put it on the screen and there'll be a link somewhere I think we need more
1512000	1517600	of that more ways of not necessarily making sure everyone on the left believes the same thing
1517600	1524400	but that we are all pushing in the same direction and see each other as allies next do you agree
1524400	1528720	rats greater than blue jays of course you do what is your take on political violence first of all
1528720	1534720	no I don't agree that rats are greater than blue jays I would put them equal because I try not to be
1534720	1541440	an animal supremacist okay okay why am I take on political violence in defense I I think it's
1541440	1547200	absolutely vital and necessary there are a lot of rough groups out there and I think if you're
1547200	1552240	marching against certain groups and you know certain elements will be there it's important to
1552240	1558480	defend yourself the police might not necessarily have your back or be there in time that said
1558480	1564240	a poor political violence more broadly and I don't believe it's an especially great tool when
1564240	1571280	there are avenues to express or to enact actual change people might not like electoral politics
1571280	1575680	but it has been shown to change and it's far more effective than political violence in the system
1575680	1580960	we have now I'm also skeptical of more revolutionary types of violence that completely that roll out
1580960	1586400	the guillotine and start chopping people's heads off because well revolutions are very turbulent
1586400	1590400	and you never know what you're gonna get and it's important to look at the population around you
1590400	1595520	I would advise any violent revolutionary or anyone who advocates political violence to look at the
1595520	1600960	other side look at how many there are of them and to what degree they are armed and ask yourself
1600960	1606240	what the result of open combat or violence would be here I think it's better to persuade people
1606240	1611600	non-violently to our side and ironically enough once we have all those people on our side we won't
1611600	1616640	need violence anymore because electoral politics will become more powerful what is your favorite
1616640	1622240	book or best book you've read one of my all-time favorites is Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire
1623040	1629040	really great book about the invasive nature of literary criticism or recently I really enjoyed
1629040	1635680	The Memoir Educated by Tara Westover very stirring story about a woman who grew up in a very
1635680	1640880	restrictive environment if you want something a little more fun I would recommend the Mistborn
1640880	1645200	trilogy by Brandon Sanderson I had a lot of fun reading those too I want to read more Brandon
1645200	1649920	Sanderson but it's hard to find the time when you're oh god I'm just thinking about the horrible
1649920	1655680	conservative novel I have to start reading that's gonna be fun are there any conservative content
1655680	1662960	creators you respect I assume that means respect on YouTube I'm gonna go with no there are
1662960	1669280	conservative commentators who I generally not necessarily enjoy but honestly disagree with
1669280	1676160	on YouTube ugh no what is the most painful right-wing youtuber you've ever watched don't
1676160	1681440	kind of convenient these questions are so close I would probably say no bullshit I'm sure there
1681440	1687360	have been singular videos from other people who are worse but his content is just so completely
1687360	1695120	devoid of anything it's just the most asinine superficial stuff I've ever seen I haven't
1695120	1701840	watched it in a while maybe he's gotten better I doubt it his stuff blows I just cannot watch it
1702880	1710240	okay let's move on to the curious cat questions what's your process making media analysis videos
1710240	1715040	I rewatch your sitcom analysis and secret empire videos all the time they're so well made and I'd
1715040	1720560	love to know how they happen huh also would you ever make a video on Frasier love your channel
1720640	1725600	first of all thank you I always appreciate that as for the process when it comes to either
1725600	1732800	watching a TV show or reading a comic book event I watch and read all of it while taking copious
1732800	1738880	notes either little things I notice they'd be funny jokes any recurring patterns or themes or
1738880	1744720	ideas while taking those notes I always include timestamps page numbers whatever I need to to
1744720	1749840	make sure that the section I'm referring to can be easily found again when I'm actually
1749840	1755440	writing the script and then editing together the video it sucks to mention a certain scene
1755440	1761280	or moment or line that you then have to hunt for because you totally forgot where it was
1761840	1769040	200 episodes of a sitcom ago when I get to the end I might rewatch certain key sections or moments
1769040	1772720	and I usually mark that stuff out ahead of time but I'll try to look over the whole thing just
1772720	1778720	in case there's anything I missed after that I will then go about putting together a script
1778720	1782480	how I organize it depends on what I'm talking about sometimes I'll just go through things
1782480	1787280	chronologically usually because that's the easiest way to do it but I also like pulling out
1787280	1792800	specific touchstones or themes to certain sections I try to create these videos for people who have
1792800	1798320	either watched or read what I'm talking about or haven't so I try to offer as many handholds as
1798320	1802640	possible when it comes to the plot and the characters just to make sure everyone is on
1802640	1808080	board and following along and then I try to probe a little deeper digging further into
1808080	1813600	what the central themes and ideas being explored are as for a Frasier video it's
1814400	1818800	possible I've been asked for a Frasier and Cheers one in the past and I'd probably want to make
1818800	1825040	back-to-back videos about those who knows maybe in the future I don't have any plans at the moment
1825040	1832560	though next question what is your ideal partner one thing I would appreciate in an ideal partner
1832560	1839280	is a healthy sense of curiosity I think someone who has questions about the world and is willing
1839280	1845120	to try and figure them out is quite admirable and something I like to think I do myself I also
1845120	1850880	appreciate warmth and kindness and a big heart really matters to me also someone with that
1850880	1854880	healthy sense of adventure I like traveling I like seeing the world don't always have the
1854880	1859040	opportunity to do it but when I do I'd like to have someone who's willing to go on those adventures
1859040	1866960	with me next do you like snow I like snow one of my favorite times of year is a cool winter night
1866960	1872960	not too cold with snow falling is really beautiful and you really get a sense of quiet and peacefulness
1872960	1879200	in moments like that even in the city so I do have a lot of love for snow hello Jose I was wondering
1879200	1884720	since you make analyses on sitcoms what are some of your personal favorites oh good question I have
1884720	1889280	very boring favorites when it comes to sitcoms The Simpsons is one of my all-time favorite TV
1889280	1896240	shows I also really enjoyed Seinfeld I wish I could offer some more obscure and strange choices but uh
1896240	1902320	you know it is what it is next are you looking to make youtube more of a career or just something
1902320	1907040	you do on the side well right now it's on the side because I simply don't make enough to make
1907040	1912480	it a career if enough people start giving to my patreon uh sure it's something I would consider
1913120	1918160	next what were your thoughts on the Canadian election considering the range of possibilities
1918160	1924160	which I think we got somewhere in the middle a compromise that satisfies no one we were looking
1924160	1930640	at a possible conservative minority so I think avoiding that is a huge win even though I'm not
1930640	1936320	really a huge fan of the Liberal Party or Justin Trudeau specifically that said the loss of all
1936320	1941360	those NDP seats is certainly going to hurt the leftist project in Canada hopefully the next
1941440	1946960	election will be a push back towards the left we'll see conservatives really blow and are bad
1946960	1952480	at elections so I guess I'm just grateful for that because the way the wind was blowing that
1952480	1958480	election could have gone much worse next will you ever do a leftist analysis on a movie instead of
1958480	1964000	a sitcom I don't have any planned right now a movie would be so much easier than a sitcom because
1964000	1968720	it's just one thing to watch instead of several hundred small things it's just a question of which
1968720	1974240	movie because movies are so overdone on YouTube that I'd want to find one that people aren't
1974240	1978880	talking about I have a few in mind I'd like to do but I would have to do some preliminary research
1978880	1984400	to make sure no one said what I have in mind because I never liked being the second person
1984400	1989360	to make a point thoughts on Nick Fuentes maybe you could do a video analyzing him like you
1989360	1996080	analyzed Tim Poole that's unlikely the issue with Nick Fuentes is that I saw this one clip of him
1996080	2001360	discussing tactics and one of those tactics involved a very loose relationship with the
2001360	2006080	truth and the idea that you can say or do whatever you want as long as it's advancing your cause
2006080	2010800	you don't have to hold yourself to any sort of personal standard as long as you're advancing the
2010800	2015760	cause and that really just summed up why people like that aren't necessarily worth engaging
2016400	2020560	if he becomes more relevant maybe I'll make a video about him but he seems pretty fringe at
2020560	2026960	the moment thoughts on Ronald Reagan it's weird that he's become a deity of sorts even though
2026960	2034000	most of his policies were pretty bad and his victory over the Soviet Union has been wildly
2034000	2040560	exaggerated and it really shows the power of the modern conservative echo chamber to deify a man
2040560	2047120	who while popular was not a great president I wonder if we'll see that happen again with
2047120	2052480	the current man in charge next who are your influences when making YouTube content who do
2052480	2058640	you perceive as the influences on your beliefs well for YouTube content I think it's pretty obvious
2058640	2066240	I owe a debt to the youtuber Sean who as we all know invented the whole idea of talking and not
2066240	2072160	appearing on camera before then it just was not a thing right potholder 54 for instance is a
2072240	2076880	youtuber I have a lot of respect for also an influence on how I make my content the way he
2076880	2082960	approaches his work his dogged attempts to engage with research and portray people honestly is
2082960	2087760	something I really respect and to do it in a fun entertaining way I think everything has a degree
2087760	2094480	of influence on you one way or the other I could say for instance Dave Rubin had a massive influence
2094480	2099920	on me on what not to do and that is to never do anything that ever resembles Dave Rubin's work
2099920	2107600	ever lest I start hating myself uncontrollably as for influences on my beliefs who there are a lot
2107600	2113920	of them a lot of what I believe now is influenced by the life I've led the people I've met in my
2113920	2119440	my personal life the books I've read the things I've learned about the world and generally just
2119440	2124800	trying to keep a positive attitude to the world around me not necessarily a positive in the terms
2124880	2131520	of being happy but positive in wanting the best for the world next what is your introduction song
2131520	2137440	I like the voice for that one I actually got my friend Dana to record a little answer so let's
2137440	2143440	let her handle this one hey it's Dana I recorded the intro and outro music for Jose's videos which
2143440	2152080	was truly such an honor and like oh my god I'm on a Q&A now am I like famous for this high channel
2152080	2158640	oh anyway let's get into this so the song is untitled but I think if I had to call it something
2158640	2165280	I would call it what could have been a beautiful love letter to a long and amazing friendship
2165280	2170800	but Jose demanded we cut it down to about three seconds by Dana and also kind of by Jose
2172480	2177520	but actually thank you so much every time you guys say something sweet about me Jose screenshots and
2177520	2182960	sends it to me and every time you say something not so nice he screenshots and texts that to me
2182960	2189200	as well so don't think that I don't see you just kidding you guys are so nice and you make me blush
2189200	2194240	like all the time so just thank you so much I'm really pleased that you liked the song bye
2195040	2202080	so thank you Fat Dana next have you heard of ContraPoints she's a trans youtuber who
2202160	2207840	was recently cancelled due to hiring transphobe Buck Angel to do a 10 second voice clip there's
2207840	2212640	more to the story of course but I was wondering what your opinions on the controversy were if any
2212640	2218000	and or if you'd be willing to do a video on it slash ContraPoints not to bring her down but offer
2218000	2223360	a calmer opinion on the events to answer the first part of the question yes I have heard of the
2223360	2227840	ContraPoints channel I've been a viewer for a very long time and have enjoyed many of our videos
2228560	2232320	as for the second part of that question as to whether or not I will make a video about
2232320	2238800	that whole controversy I will absolutely not be doing that it seems like a very intense war that
2238800	2244960	does more harm than good in the division it sows amongst people I will say this there should
2244960	2250880	always be a space to offer friendly and constructive criticism of any youtuber and the
2250880	2256160	choices they make in their videos so long as people are doing that respectfully and with the
2256240	2263200	effort to get someone to improve that's only ever a good thing next do you own any blue jays if not
2263200	2267120	what birds do you own I don't think you can legally own a blue jay I don't think it's a
2267120	2272400	bird that's been domesticated I don't own any birds I don't plan to own any birds I am
2272400	2279680	uncomfortable with the idea of owning birds myself because I don't like the idea of caging them birds
2279680	2285120	can fly free through the sky and I can't imagine them liking their cages if you're a bird owner I
2285120	2290480	hope you treat them kindly and with love and affection very open to the idea of having a like
2290480	2295600	a bird friend that lives in my backyard or flies around and maybe shows up every now and again for
2295600	2302400	some seed and to hang out but that's as far as I'd go with a bird relationship next how does
2302400	2306640	Canada determine who wins an election because in the United States we have the electoral college
2306640	2310960	who is a body of electors established by the United States Constitution which forms every
2310960	2315440	four years for the sole purpose of electing the president and vice president of the United States
2315440	2320240	it has a lot of flaws like the existence of swing states and giving small more votes and more power
2320240	2326400	despite a small percentage living there in fact I learned from CGP Grey that the president can win
2326400	2332960	the electoral college with only 22 of the popular vote is the way Canada determines election more
2332960	2339200	fair than the US personally I think so in Canada we have a parliamentary system so the idea is
2339200	2344560	whichever political party wins the most seats in election the leader of that party becomes
2344560	2350000	the prime minister there's also the possibility if you don't win enough seats to form a majority
2350000	2354320	or even a clear minority there's also the possibility of coalition governments forming
2354320	2360160	where two parties can combine their forces and name a prime minister and form a government together
2360160	2364560	although that's pretty rare in Canada we almost never have coalition governments
2364560	2369520	I also think it's neat that the leaders of the parties actually have to run in specific ridings
2369520	2374880	so we've had cases like in our previous election where Maxine Bernier who is the leader of the
2374880	2380720	People's Party of Canada also known as the far-right anti-immigration party he actually
2381280	2387040	lost in his riding so he doesn't even get to be in parliament which is awesome oh yeah that's
2387040	2391280	another thing even if your party loses if you're the leader of the party effectively running for
2391280	2396320	the prime ministership you can still be in the government but you would just be a member of
2396320	2400240	parliament you probably wouldn't be the leader of your party come the next election either
2401040	2407440	next do you believe in the deep state sort of in the sense that there are career bureaucrats who
2407440	2412320	work within governments through most of their lives and will carry with them certain opinions
2412320	2419760	and political positions sure but I think the term deep state is often weaponized by administrations
2419760	2426880	to filter out these career bureaucrats and instead replace them with lackeys who will just operate as
2426880	2434080	ideological tools if we're going to truly combat the deep state or I should say the entrenched
2434080	2440640	wisdom within political structures it needs to be done in a way that isn't so in terms of partisan
2440640	2446960	hackery are there any video games that you like let's keep it to more recent games I just finished
2446960	2451760	playing god of war which I kind of want to do a video on there's so much to say there I think
2451760	2455840	that one's been done to death one of my favorite games of all time is the legend of zelda breath
2455840	2460720	of the wild that was just that but like I was playing the future mario galaxy 2 is one of my
2460720	2466080	absolute favorites persona 4 metal gear solid even the twin snakes version snake eater that
2466080	2470800	was probably my favorite of that series elite beat agents or any sort of music game is something I
2470800	2476080	can get down for I actually nearly made a video for my channel about no more heroes which I think
2476080	2481280	is one of the best examples of video games as art but then I noticed there was a channel out there
2481280	2484480	oh god I don't even remember the name of the channel or the name of the video but it did a
2484480	2490240	look at no more heroes that said everything that I want to say so I thought it's been said and then
2490240	2494640	I didn't make the video I might make one on video games at some point in the future but I'm not in
2494640	2500160	a rush next do you think these right wingers will ever lose their fame they're just dominating the
2500160	2505680	internet I think a lot of them actually have especially the ones have been around for years
2505680	2510880	and years a lot of them seem to have carved out these little fiefdoms and while they do have
2510880	2515760	viewership and some success they don't have the relevance they once did of course there's an
2515760	2520320	endless stream of them and they just seem to cycle them out as old ones lose their luster
2520320	2524720	I don't think we should ever count on them just losing their fame that's why part of the reason
2524720	2529840	I made this channel is to push back against it and I'm so encouraged by all the new left-wing
2529840	2534640	channels I've seen appear since I started making mine not that I think mine is necessarily
2534720	2539920	influencing any specific ones I'm just glad that there are more voices because this truly is
2539920	2545440	an all hands on deck type of situation and the more we push back against it the better and it's
2545440	2549120	always easier to push back when you're doing it with a lot of people next have you thought about
2549120	2554560	exploring Caitlin Bennett and her horrible content for those who don't know this is the gun girl
2554560	2559680	she showed up to some college with an assault rifle she took photographs of her walking around
2559920	2564320	she was instantly the poster girl for many conservatives and she now goes around for info
2564320	2568960	wars interviewing college students asking them questions and then they just humiliate her with
2568960	2574480	the responses it's kind of like the opposite of Steven Crowder's thing where he goes out and tries
2574480	2580080	to make them look stupid and usually by using his deceptive tactics can do that Caitlin Bennett
2580080	2583520	isn't nearly as capable and she just ends up looking like an idiot I don't think I need to
2583520	2588080	make a video of it I think just watching one of her videos is enough to embarrass her next do you
2588080	2593520	think capitalism will fall sometime in this century oh since we're only about 20 years in
2593520	2600800	it's possible think about the end of capitalism which I generally like the sound of it needs to
2600800	2606880	be done by people who are ready for it by that I mean it's something we all have to buy into rather
2606880	2611600	than something that will create a top-down improvement in the world I think there has to
2611760	2618000	be a degree of bottom-up buying into so to speak of a post-capitalism world that's a lot of hearts
2618000	2623760	and minds to change can we get there by the end of the century I think we have to try will it happen
2623760	2630640	though I'm not that optimistic next where do you go for unbiased news what about biased entertaining
2630640	2637200	news I go nowhere for unbiased news here's a new slash all news is biased what I tried to do is
2637200	2642800	find news that can be sourced when I say biased news I should clarify I don't mean the sort of
2642800	2647680	stupid left right-wing bias that people talk about a lot of mainstream media isn't as left
2647680	2653120	biased as people pretend it is it's more biased toward the status quo so generally speaking I
2653120	2660560	think any news that can inform you is helpful regardless of its bias the more extreme it's
2660560	2665200	biased it gets tougher because often that includes distorting things through some kind of
2665200	2670320	funhouse mirror what I would recommend is always look for news that can be adequately sourced
2670320	2676240	to some primary source of information if it mentions a poll for instance if it instead of
2676240	2680480	like sending you to blog after blog after blog and eventually finding the poll something that
2680480	2684800	links directly to the poll is better better still is checking out that poll for yourself and seeing
2684800	2691840	how accurately the article in question represents it same thing for interviews or descriptions of
2691840	2698240	events and there's the old reporter's adage of believe nothing you hear in half of what you see
2698240	2703840	it's always good to be skeptical but that said if someone can demonstrate something is true I
2703840	2709360	suggest you believe it and not just write it off as fake news because it might be something you
2709360	2715600	don't agree with another little axiom that might be helpful the truth does not change in accordance
2715600	2721760	with our ability to stomach it that's from Flannery O'Connor are there any anime and manga
2721760	2728400	that you like yes definitely loads my favorite tv series of all time not just anime is nana
2728400	2734080	favorite manga too by the way it is so good I will make a video about this one day I kind of
2734080	2739440	hope the series ends before I do but it's been on hiatus for eight years so who knows but there's
2739440	2745360	loads of others I enjoyed cowboy bebop is one of my all-time favorites also a big fan of gundam seed
2745360	2751520	best gundam don't care what anyone says I just watched carol on tuesday that was fantastic more
2751520	2755840	people should check that out great music kids on the slope is really good and I even like things
2755840	2760640	not by shinshirawa nabe anything by studio ghibli obviously I mentioned princess mononoke but grave
2760640	2766640	of the fireflies is also fantastic spirited way manga wise let's give a shout out to uh monster
2766640	2772720	by naoki odisawa which is true work of art I might make a video of that someday too I also like
2773520	2777360	which is great manga I don't know if they made that into an anime yet they should I also have
2777360	2782560	a soft spot for shonen manga and anime although it's very hard to watch it and make time though
2782560	2788240	I do try to keep up with world trigger which I really enjoy I love your content thank you
2788240	2793200	I have two questions one are there any alt right youtubers you have a morbid fascination with
2793200	2797120	two I really loved your rosan analysis do you have any other shows that you think would be worth
2797120	2802080	a rewatch if I've made a video on someone I probably have some degree of fascination with
2802080	2806080	them I don't know if I'd call it morbid though pretty good at disconnecting from the alt right
2806080	2812000	space when I'm not actively working on something as for the second one if I make a video on something
2812640	2816800	you can assume I think it's probably worth a rewatch and I've got another sickon video in the
2816800	2822320	works and I will say that's worth a rewatch too but with some caveats these are all big shows
2822320	2826800	sometimes it's better to just check out certain episodes and I try to highlight them as I go along
2826800	2831280	there are lots of great shows to rewatch though I'm just gonna put a bunch on screen pick any of
2831280	2838640	those sure they're good dumb question alert if you live in Toronto and have a JPFP then was your
2838640	2844320	channel inspired by the Toronto Blue Jays no I just think Blue Jays are really cool the team's
2844320	2850800	fine uh the similarity to the Blue Jay logos is a coincidence it just happens that the bird looks
2850800	2856080	like the logo and I'll put them side by side you can see the similarity but uh you know what I'm
2856080	2862080	also going to show you all the original photo that my drawing was inspired by this was the image I
2862080	2868480	was trying to recreate in my own unique style next how do you pronounce your channel name
2869120	2876800	Jose that was easy there were two questions about Tim Poole's eventual response to my videos about
2876800	2881760	him I don't know if this is actually happening these two questions are all that I've heard about
2882080	2887680	if Tim Poole wants to defend his work he's more than entitled to my main concern is that I'm
2887680	2893360	worried he won't understand my video if he were to respond at all he'll try to defend individual
2893360	2900560	points and say I was wrong about this I was wrong about that and try to argue in that sense and that
2900560	2907600	misses the whole point my video wasn't about the content found in that specific week so much as it
2907600	2913680	was about how Tim delivers his content more broadly I was looking at his methods the way
2913680	2918720	he frames issues the way he just repeats conservative talking points and the way he
2918720	2923440	just gives you a superficial understanding of the stories he reads for example I noticed a lot of
2923440	2929280	people were pushing back on me about the California bill that affects freelance employees I actually
2929280	2933440	have no opinion on that because I've not really researched it maybe I should have made that clearer
2933440	2939120	in the video my point was that Tim is trying to present a very specific perspective on that bill
2939120	2943760	that reinforces a conservative narrative it could very well be that that bill is awful and does
2943760	2949280	terrible things that's not what I was interested in I was more interested in how Tim was dishonestly
2949280	2954800	framing that bill by omitting certain key facts in the story he supposedly read if he actually
2954800	2959440	responds to my videos in a thoughtful way that actually understands the point I was trying to
2959440	2965840	make I'd love to see that not holding my breath though last question and I'm so glad the last
2965840	2972880	question is so so good and such a valuable insight into my site thoughts on cat girls
2973440	2979600	if someone is a cat girl I respect their identity and to identify as a cat girl I value and respect
2979600	2986480	you and on that lovely note the Q&A comes to a close thank you to all my patrons for helping
