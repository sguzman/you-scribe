1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,880
This video includes discussion of people being hit, and in some cases killed, by cars.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,440
I won't be using any footage or images of people being hit, but some of the discussion

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,480
will get intense.

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:23,800
On July 4th, on the I-5 freeway in Seattle, Washington, two Black Lives Matter protesters,

5
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,840
Summer Taylor and Diaz Love, were hit by a car that had driven through their protest.

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:32,480
The collision killed Taylor and left Love with critical injuries.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:38,120
The driver, DeWitt Kalit, was charged with vehicular homicide, vehicular assault, and

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,440
reckless driving.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,640
The I-5 freeway had been shut down by police at the time, as it had over the previous 19

10
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,860
days protests that had also taken place on the freeway.

11
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,140
Police suspect the driver entered the I-5 freeway from an exit ramp along Stewart Street.

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,280
He would then have needed to perform a U-turn and driven roughly one quarter of a mile before

13
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,200
reaching the protesters.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:02,280
As the driver approached the 30 or so protesters, he drove around the two cars set up as barricades

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,200
and then hit both Taylor and Love.

16
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:07,420
The collision occurred at roughly 1.40 am.

17
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,920
After the collision, the driver slowed his car before driving off when several of the

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,620
other protesters approached him.

19
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:14,680
He was later arrested by police.

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,120
The driver reportedly was not intoxicated at the time, according to a field test performed

21
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,780
by police, but in court documents it was stated that he was dealing with an untreated addiction

22
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:29,700
issue involving Percocet, a substance that appears to be crystal meth, and several implements

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,140
commonly used to smoke illegal substances were found in his car.

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,260
According to police, the driver expressed concern for the well-being of the two people

25
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,260
he hit.

26
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,380
Kalit's lawyer has claimed that there was nothing political about the incident.

27
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:47,820
With the most charity I can muster, this could be considered an incident of reckless driving,

28
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,860
possibly under the influence of drugs, leading to the death and severe injury of two people.

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,180
As someone looking at the evidence, it's difficult to ascribe any specific attempt

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,180
to Kalit.

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,060
According to the individual who first published video of this incident to Twitter and who

32
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:06,380
was a witness at the scene, the driver was acting deliberately.

33
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,700
But something else happened after this horrific moment.

34
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,420
The footage of the accident went viral, and an apparatus of conservative spin kicked into

35
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,500
gear.

36
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:18,900
After the footage of the collision was posted to Twitter, the tweet was spread by Ian Miles

37
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,900
Chong.

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,740
He made a series of tweets claiming the protesters were responsible for getting hit.

39
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:28,140
It is illegal to block an interstate, plain and simple.

40
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,420
Police say that the driver involved in the Seattle I-5 hit is being interviewed and will

41
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,120
likely be charged with aggravated assault and a hit and run.

42
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:39,820
But the fault is of the protesters for blocking the interstate.

43
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,200
He also went on to spread misinformation about the incident.

44
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,080
The two people who got hit look like they ran back into the path of the car after it

45
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,100
swerved to the left to avoid the other protesters.

46
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,520
Why the hell?

47
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,080
The problem with the protest group, and you can watch the full two-hour livestream, is

48
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,040
that they moved on to the freeway without informing the police about their whereabouts,

49
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,740
so police couldn't properly seal off the area because they received little notice.

50
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,360
Not only were police aware, they had barricaded entrances to the freeway.

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,620
These protests on the I-5 had been going on for 19 days, and according to this tweet,

52
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:15,960
they had closed the highway nearly two hours before the incident.

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,860
Ian, like some other people we'll be looking at, is determined to present a version of

54
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,120
events where a driver who sees cars parked on a freeway surrounded by a group of 30 people

55
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,240
has no expectation of even slowing down to a safe speed while passing.

56
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,200
We saw similar takes from our dear friend in a beanie, Tim Pool.

57
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,320
Sad to see anyone lose their life, we need to do better to teach our kids not to hang

58
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,700
out on interstate highways at night while wearing all black around a curve and with

59
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,680
vehicles blocking view of you and your friends.

60
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,800
Hopefully Tim gave us a video to offer some more nuance to his position.

61
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,240
At night, wearing all black.

62
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,880
Several protesters dressed in non-black outfits are clearly visible, and Summer Taylor, seen

63
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,160
right here, is clearly not wearing an all-black outfit.

64
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,920
Also, there are, like, 30 people here.

65
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,160
No lights at night.

66
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,960
There are, of course, lights all over the freeway.

67
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:13,480
Maybe he means the protesters should have lights, but this is me guessing because all

68
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,360
he ever says is, no lights.

69
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Regardless though, there's clearly enough lights to see the protesters from a distance,

70
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,720
as evidenced by this camera showing us the protesters from a distance.

71
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,720
Think about this.

72
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,160
You're on a highway.

73
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,760
You're coming around a curve.

74
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:32,520
All of a sudden, before you realize it because it's at night and there's no lights, there's

75
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,960
two vehicles in the middle of the road.

76
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,960
What do you do?

77
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,240
This guy swerved out of the way.

78
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,680
When he swerved onto the shoulder, a ton of people were standing there.

79
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
So what did he do?

80
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
He swerved to the left.

81
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Pop, pop.

82
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,360
And he hit two people, sending them flying, one of which is now dead.

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,120
I can't believe they're charging this guy for this.

84
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,200
The very idea that 30 people were hidden behind two vehicles and that the driver couldn't

85
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:00,200
have possibly seen these two vehicles blocking off the road until the last second is absurd.

86
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,980
The band Tim goes on about was roughly 600 feet away.

87
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,240
That the highway had been empty for a quarter of a mile should have perhaps tipped him off.

88
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,640
That something was up.

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,480
Tim's standard incompetence aside, we get to the real heart of this video later on.

90
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:18,600
Am I going to blame this guy because he was driving his car on the highway?

91
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,600
That's ridiculous.

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,440
If anything, the protesters should be held to some degree criminally, criminally liable

93
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,140
for blocking a highway.

94
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,640
It's a crime.

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,120
Why aren't they getting in trouble?

96
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,280
This is, of course, not the first time Tim has lied about footage.

97
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,480
They're yelling, pop his effing tires and you hear them deflating his tires and then

98
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,600
he slowly speeds up and they all start screaming and banging on his, actually, I'm sorry,

99
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,360
they start banging on his vehicle first.

100
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,960
Then he slowly speeds up.

101
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,200
I don't want to say speeding, like he's inching forward and then people start going

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,720
yelling.

103
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,600
And then once he's clear of protesters, he just goes and takes off.

104
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,600
That's it.

105
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,720
Tim went on to play the shakiest, least helpful footage he could find, but if you actually

106
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,520
look up the video he cites, you'll see that this part in particular didn't make it into

107
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,520
Tim's video.

108
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:14,360
That looks a little dangerous to me.

109
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:18,100
There's also no footage of what happened before the vehicle was stopped by protesters.

110
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:23,400
So the story, in Tim's mind, only starts when we see the vehicle surrounded by protesters.

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,800
How it got there and in what way cannot possibly be inferred because all protesters are liars.

112
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,200
And evil.

113
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:39,680
Welcome to the modern era, where the activists will obviously lie about everything.

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,480
Man evil people, I tell you what.

115
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,880
I should offer a brief correction here.

116
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,440
I used to think Tim was just a fool who had no idea what he was talking about.

117
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,920
My position has evolved and I'll issue a correction right here.

118
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,480
I think he's deliberately misrepresenting the facts here.

119
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,560
He's just not particularly bright in how he goes about it, or at least he has a very serious

120
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,880
contempt for his audience and doesn't think they'll care that he's so transparently

121
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
lying to them.

122
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,800
But social media provocateurs are not the only people downplaying vehicular assault.

123
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,120
Tucker Carlson's Daily Wire has previously released a compilation of protesters being

124
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:27,920
accosted by vehicles, played to the tune of Ludacris's Move, Bitch.

125
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,080
Daily caller writer Blake Neff also published article with his headline and subheader.

126
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,520
Anti-Columbus Day protesters threatened to assault driver get run over.

127
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,480
White man overruns indigenous peoples with superior technology.

128
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:48,120
Blake Neff, for the curious, was formerly the head writer for Tucker Carlson's Fox

129
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,480
News show, but recently resigned after he was discovered to have participated in an

130
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,080
explicitly racist message board for the last 10 years, often inserting the racist messaging

131
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:00,140
from that board into scripts for Tucker Carlson.

132
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,000
And of course, I would be remiss not to mention the death of Heather Heyer, who was murdered

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,480
at the Charlottesville rally when a car ran into a group of counter-protesters.

134
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:13,120
This incident was similarly spun by media figures and other assorted internet buffoons.

135
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,760
Here's a brief example of YouTuber Carl Benjamin showing us his intellectual metal.

136
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:26,640
It looks like what happened is that he was shocked by seeing the car crash happening

137
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,440
and had a heart attack.

138
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,440
I know, I know, it's horrible, but it does seem a very dramatic reaction to a car crash.

139
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:42,080
It's more than the alt-right being blamed for someone having a heart attack.

140
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,560
Someone in tremendously bad physical condition has heart attack and suddenly the alt-right

141
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,000
has murdered someone.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,320
Mike Brown, a police detective for King County, which Seattle is a part of, posted a meme

143
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,120
to his Facebook after Summer Taylor and Diaz Love were struck by a car.

144
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,880
All lives splatter, keep your ass off the road.

145
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:05,920
Brown is currently on leave and the family of Summer Taylor has called for his firing.

146
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,440
All this spin, all these distortions are done with the express purpose of changing the narrative.

147
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,680
It wants people to believe that the protesters who are hit by cars are not victims.

148
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,760
That they are either liars and frauds or somehow deserving of any injury or death that

149
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,960
meets them while they are trying to exercise their right to protest.

150
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:28,840
The reactions commentators like this generate on social media are particularly ghoulish.

151
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:32,680
Who else here feels sorry for the driver and any damages to their car?

152
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:35,920
And I honestly don't care if those idiots were removed from the gene pool.

153
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,800
They were in the middle of I-5 at night, the height of stupid.

154
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,520
I call this self-defense.

155
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:43,040
Why are they blocking the road?

156
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,560
What are they going to do to you if you stop?

157
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,540
This guy didn't want to find out.

158
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:51,120
No one wants to get ripped from their cars from the mob anymore.

159
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,080
We've had enough.

160
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,080
The effect on the audience, I think, is clear.

161
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,320
Working in tandem with messages describing protesters as violent rioters, particularly

162
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,800
in the context of this story when the only violence expressed towards the driver came

163
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,440
after he had just run over two people, is part of the goals of these anti-protest commentaries.

164
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,880
The idea is to vilify the protesters and their message, and they'll ignore, distort,

165
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,120
and lie about whatever facts they need to do that.

166
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,840
Speaking to the New York Times, Ari E. Weil, the deputy research director at the Chicago

167
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,280
Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago, described this growing culture

168
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,280
of sharing memes about protesters being run over.

169
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,400
It's not just an extremist thing here.

170
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,420
There are social media circles online where people are sharing these and joking about

171
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,740
them because they disagree with the protests and their methods.

172
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,120
Sharing memes and joking about running over people can lead to real danger.

173
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,260
This was echoed by Josh Lepowski, a senior researcher at the Counter Extremism Project.

174
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:54,180
There has been an increasing amount of propaganda online calling for vehicular attacks on protesters,

175
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,300
targeting the Black Lives Matter movement in particular.

176
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,940
It is being used as a form of intimidation against them to get them to halt their protests.

177
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,580
According to research done by Weil, there have been at least 66 car attacks across the

178
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:12,580
United States since George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police on May 25th, 2020.

179
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:17,860
Of those 66, 24 have led to charges being filed, while 4 have been ruled accidents.

180
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,580
Perhaps most disturbingly, 7 of these incidents involved police officers.

181
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,500
Car attacks have become an increasingly common topic in recent years, and in response, some

182
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:30,620
state legislatures have proposed bills that would protect drivers who unintentionally

183
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,540
harm or kill protesters.

184
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,560
Although there are some Facebook memes to the contrary, so far none of these bills have

185
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,280
actually been passed.

186
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:42,000
There is an awkward conversation to be had regarding the safety of protesters, whether

187
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,720
it be staying as visible as possible at night or effectively communicating threats to others.

188
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,940
Many protests do have earnest discussions and big precautions to keep people safe, and

189
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:55,040
I think good natured criticism on how that can be improved should be welcomed.

190
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,340
But a sharp line needs to be drawn between constructive criticism to improve protests

191
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,060
and criticism that's designed to undermine and discredit entire movements.

192
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:09,560
When people such as Tim Poole or Mike Brown tell people to get off the streets, it isn't

193
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:13,220
out of concern for the safety of protesters, it's because they want to discredit the

194
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,920
very message behind the movement.

195
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:19,240
When it comes to the individuals driving cars who crash through these protests, they're

196
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,540
presented as victims of circumstance and not held to nearly the same level of responsibility

197
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,180
of the protesters.

198
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:29,140
Another thing lost in this discussion is that the safety of the protesters is not the only

199
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,200
issue at play here.

200
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,620
This is also about free expression.

201
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:35,800
In the week leading up to me writing this script, free expression and cancel culture

202
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,340
came up in the context of people being booted off very large platforms, such as the recent

203
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,720
removal of Stefan Molyneux and Richard Spencer from YouTube.

204
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,900
Every time this happens to a conservative, or in this case, white nationalist, there's

205
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:52,040
an outcry from the right about how cancel culture is out of control and the left is

206
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,260
constantly attacking the free marketplace of ideas.

207
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,340
The free marketplace of ideas is an incredibly apt name, in that it functions the same way

208
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:03,140
a free economic market works in society today.

209
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,900
The lack of regulation creates the guise of a lack of bias, ignoring how some people have

210
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:12,700
been left out of the conversation, and that the playing field is most certainly not even.

211
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:17,940
Taylor and Love, much like other protesters, were exercising the right of free expression,

212
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:21,740
but instead of racing to their defense, people who supposedly care about free expression

213
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:25,980
are bending over backwards to blame them for being hit by a car.

214
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:30,200
You probably wouldn't even know the names of these two people had one of them not died

215
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,180
and the other been seriously injured.

216
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,380
In much the same way Black Lives Matter only gained traction when thousands of people took

217
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,880
to the streets, demanding the attention of the mainstream media.

218
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:43,700
The opposition to Black Lives Matter only needs to call up the New York Times to get

219
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:48,040
some free space in the op-ed section of one of the most prominent outlets in the world

220
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,780
to say it's time to call them the military to bust the heads of these protesters.

221
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,020
That is the disparity between people who have power in the marketplace of ideas and

222
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,260
those who don't.

223
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,620
One side of the argument needs hundreds of thousands of people in the streets, the other

224
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,260
side needs a phone call, and suddenly their message is in front of millions.

225
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,220
Someone who truly cares about free expression should be most concerned about protecting

226
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,540
the expression and sometimes even holding up the expression of those with the least

227
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,700
amount of access to that free marketplace of ideas.

228
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,820
And this access cannot be entangled from the history of oppression that has denied people

229
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,620
access to these spaces.

230
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,140
Today we probably have more female commentators now than any other point in recent history

231
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,740
in the English-speaking world.

232
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:32,540
In the past, women commenting on important issues would have to write under a man's

233
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,580
name, like George Eliot had to do in the 19th century.

234
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,980
Or if they did openly brush up against serious subjects, they would have to issue weird prefaces

235
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:45,900
apologizing for daring to talk about workers' rights, which Elizabeth Gaskell had to do

236
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,140
in her novel, Mary Barton.

237
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,860
I know nothing of political economy or the theories of trade.

238
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:56,740
I have tried to write truthfully, and if my accounts agree or clash with any system,

239
00:14:56,740 --> 00:15:00,100
the agreement or disagreement is unintentional.

240
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,220
Although it should be said that things have improved since the 19th century, things have

241
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:09,260
not quite reached parity, as seen by any woman who has recently tried to speak out about

242
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:13,500
video games or some other important issues insecure men have a vested interest in, and

243
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,860
things get dramatically worse for people who are even further marginalized, such as a trans

244
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,540
woman being harassed for daring to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

245
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:26,140
While cancel culture is an interesting debate, it's not a debate that's happening on

246
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,700
even terms.

247
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,340
Conservatives seem chiefly concerned with protecting their own rather than broadening

248
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,940
the free marketplace of ideas to include people who have been historically denied access.

249
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,780
If you don't want to protect protesters from being run over by cars, you don't care

250
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:42,860
about protecting someone's free expression at all.

251
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,300
Over the past scene of Summer Taylor, their family held a brief press conference.

252
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:53,180
No matter how much I might want to ask them to stay safe during protests, they would just

253
00:15:53,180 --> 00:16:02,380
say, Mom, if you are black in this country, it isn't even safe to be alive.

254
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,900
And they were right.

255
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:12,900
So even in death, we want Summer's passion as an ally to continue lifting up black lives

256
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,140
in Seattle and all over our country.

257
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,500
There is a lot left to do.

258
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,500
Thank you.

259
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,140
Diaz Love is currently recovering from their injuries.

260
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:29,340
They released a statement on Facebook reading, I'm alive and stable in a lot of pain.

261
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,300
I cannot believe Summer was murdered.

262
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:35,740
If they thought this murder would make us back down, they are very wrong.

263
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,540
My FB is filled with death threats.

264
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:43,020
That and only being able to use one hand has me going slow.

265
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:46,740
I deeply appreciate and feel all the love y'all are sending me.

266
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:52,520
I've included links to the GoFundMe pages for Summer's family and Diaz Love below.

267
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:57,580
This was a tough video to do, especially since many of the details are not yet available.

268
00:16:57,580 --> 00:17:02,940
This case has not gone to trial, and the driver accused of the crime has not even been arraigned,

269
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:07,140
so details are a bit sparse, but I wanted to focus on how someone's death and injury

270
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:12,140
and how these car attacks in general are being spun to discredit very legitimate and valid

271
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,880
protest movements.

272
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:18,700
If you enjoyed this video, I would once again remind you that there are two GoFundMe pages

273
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,740
for the victims linked below.

274
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:25,180
If you would like to support my work, as many of the people going up the screen have, you

275
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,900
can join my Patreon.

276
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:31,940
And if you signed up for the $5 a month tier, you will get your name in the credits, like

277
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:37,220
these lovely people here, a download to my theme song, written and performed by my lovely

278
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:40,220
friend Dana, and early access to my videos.

279
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:44,940
There actually is a video currently waiting to be uploaded to this channel that is available

280
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,940
for my Patrons, that's there if you're interested as well.

281
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:51,420
Thank you everyone very much for watching this video.

Please remember to like, comment, subscribe, and ring the bell.

283
