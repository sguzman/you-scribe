00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
This is not a good movie.

00:02.000 --> 00:07.440
The world is great, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.

00:07.440 --> 00:11.440
On January 4th, right-wing news commentary website The Daily Wire

00:11.440 --> 00:14.480
announced it had purchased the distribution rights to the movie

00:14.480 --> 00:20.480
Run, Hide, Fight, a movie that is often described as die-hard set in a school shooting.

00:20.480 --> 00:24.000
The movie is part of the Daily Wire's attempt to move into the world of entertainment,

00:24.000 --> 00:28.080
according to an article written by one of the Daily Wire co-founders, Ben Shapiro.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.000
We're going to be bringing out movies.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.760
Edgy, entertaining, awesome movies that won't mock your values.

00:33.760 --> 00:37.680
We're going to be producing TV shows, comedies and dramas that take you seriously

00:37.680 --> 00:41.200
and that don't take advantage of your viewership to promote leftist causes.

00:41.840 --> 00:45.520
The Daily Wire is currently developing one feature and two TV series,

00:45.520 --> 00:47.920
though no specific details about those have been announced.

00:48.480 --> 00:53.920
Part ofly, madly, desperately hopes they're adapting the works of Ben Shapiro for the screen.

00:53.920 --> 00:58.000
Sadly, Run, Hide, Fight was not inspired by the written works of Ben Shapiro.

00:58.000 --> 01:02.160
In fact, this film was produced completely independently of The Daily Wire's new

01:02.160 --> 01:06.160
initiative and their only attachment to Run, Hide, Fight is to be its distributor.

01:06.160 --> 01:12.320
There are no grim bread hawthorn esquiros or drug dealers posing as civil rights activists.

01:12.320 --> 01:17.440
Instead, we have a simpler story of a teenage girl who has to gun down her classmates after

01:17.440 --> 01:18.720
they try to shoot up their school.

01:19.280 --> 01:23.280
An action movie used in a school shooting as a backdrop doesn't scream leftist values,

01:23.280 --> 01:26.400
so I can see why they chose this as their first film to distribute.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.600
The article also echoes an important lesson learned from Andrew Breitbart,

01:29.600 --> 01:33.760
who Shapiro calls his mentor, the idea of politics being downstream from culture.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.880
This move into the entertainment industry is, according to Shapiro,

01:36.880 --> 01:40.320
about fighting back against the left who supposedly dominate

01:40.320 --> 01:43.280
the major institutions of the entertainment industry.

01:43.920 --> 01:47.280
According to Jeremy Boring, co-CEO of The Daily Wire,

01:47.840 --> 01:51.040
this is a gut-wrenching film that refuses to offer easy talking points,

01:51.040 --> 01:55.040
which is why liberal Hollywood executives have refused to distribute it.

01:55.120 --> 01:57.280
The trailer had a very strong reaction on YouTube,

01:57.280 --> 02:01.440
with nearly 1.5 million views within its first two weeks of going up.

02:01.440 --> 02:04.560
The movie takes its name from a survival tactic recommended to people

02:04.560 --> 02:07.840
and instructing them on how to survive a mass shooting incident.

02:07.840 --> 02:12.800
This weird, cheesy training video is on YouTube and has over 9 million views.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.560
Run, Hide, Fight made its North American debut on January 14th

02:16.560 --> 02:20.080
in a streaming event hosted on the Daily Wire website in YouTube.

02:20.080 --> 02:23.360
According to Boring, the stream had over 70,000 viewers,

02:23.360 --> 02:26.880
but the more important question, how was the movie?

02:27.840 --> 02:30.800
The plot is very easily summarized.

02:30.800 --> 02:33.920
High school senior Zoe Hall, played by Isabel May,

02:33.920 --> 02:37.440
is disengaging from her life following the recent passing of her mother.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.760
Upon going to school, her day is interrupted by the arrival of four school shooters

02:41.760 --> 02:44.800
who take some of their classmates hostage in the cafeteria.

02:44.800 --> 02:50.160
The shooters livestream the hostage situation while Zoe first runs, hides, and then fights.

02:50.240 --> 02:54.640
She takes out each of the three cronies before killing their ringleader in the movie's final moments.

02:55.520 --> 02:58.880
Not exactly a plot filled with surprising twists and turns,

02:58.880 --> 03:01.600
and one completely predictable for anyone who saw the trailer.

03:01.600 --> 03:06.640
In spite of the subject material, this is a movie that very safely follows the action movie formulas.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.440
School shootings are indeed a rare topic in films.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.000
There are several of them out there, such as Elephant,

03:12.000 --> 03:15.440
We Need to Talk About Kevin, Polytechnique, and a handful of others.

03:15.440 --> 03:19.360
They often take artistic approaches you don't typically see in mainstream movies.

03:19.360 --> 03:22.080
The very real horror of a school shooting seems to demand

03:22.080 --> 03:25.360
filmmakers use unorthodox methods to broach the subject.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.920
Or maybe it's just a subject that attracts filmmakers

03:27.920 --> 03:31.200
whose talents don't neatly fit into the mainstream mold.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.560
But this is not one of those movies.

03:34.560 --> 03:38.080
Throughout its run, Run, Hide, Fight feels like a popcorn movie.

03:38.080 --> 03:41.040
Which is a strange experience, considering the subject matter.

03:41.040 --> 03:45.280
It seems to be asking the audience to compartmentalize the very real tragedy of a school shooting,

03:45.280 --> 03:49.600
put all that baggage aside, and watch the movie as a form of entertainment.

03:49.600 --> 03:52.080
The idea of ignoring the tragedy of a school shooting,

03:52.080 --> 03:56.560
at least insofar in wanting to discuss it politically, is often a project of the right.

03:56.560 --> 04:00.880
Whenever a school shooting happens, conversations about gun control are immediately silenced,

04:00.880 --> 04:04.880
and at best you might get some token discussion about mental health.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.720
Discussion that isn't terribly helpful,

04:06.720 --> 04:10.720
considering most mental health conditions don't result in school shootings.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.400
In fact, the vast majority don't.

04:12.400 --> 04:16.160
What we're more likely to hear are refrains about not wanting to disrespect

04:16.160 --> 04:18.960
the victims by politicizing a tragedy.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.200
In other words, don't consider any potential political action

04:23.200 --> 04:26.160
that might reduce the possibility of future school shootings.

04:26.160 --> 04:29.520
With that in mind, it's unsurprising that a conservative audience might be more capable

04:29.520 --> 04:33.840
of compartmentalizing a phenomena that right-wing media rarely critically examines.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.160
School shootings are something to be prepared for,

04:36.160 --> 04:40.640
but are also something that we're supposedly unable to actively prevent.

04:40.640 --> 04:43.360
Movies like this seem to be suggesting that school shootings,

04:43.360 --> 04:47.360
a rarity outside of the last few decades, are now part of the new normal.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.240
So we might as well make some action movies about them.

04:50.240 --> 04:55.040
This movie has a hero, Zoe Hall, which is a rarity for movies about school shootings.

04:55.040 --> 04:58.240
After all, if the purpose of the film is to explore the tragedy,

04:58.240 --> 05:01.680
a hero who prevents said tragedy seems counterproductive.

05:01.680 --> 05:04.000
In this case, the movie tries to have it both ways,

05:04.000 --> 05:07.600
featuring a number of students getting killed at the beginning of the hostage situation.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.880
Also, unlike other movies about school shootings, in the opening scene of the movie,

05:10.880 --> 05:14.640
the impending school shooting is foreshadowed with heavy-handed dialogue.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.000
I'm gonna record an EP this summer.

05:16.000 --> 05:16.640
No way.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.200
Yeah, give the dream a shot before reality kicks me in the cooch.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.080
Nice!

05:20.080 --> 05:21.120
Jump cut scares.

05:23.280 --> 05:23.680
Okay!

05:24.560 --> 05:26.560
And two different explosions.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.320
This is not a subtle film.

05:29.120 --> 05:33.120
Zoe is one of those strange leading characters who happens to be the only one in the movie with

05:33.120 --> 05:36.480
functioning eyes and notices something is slightly off during the day,

05:36.480 --> 05:39.600
such as the smoke from an explosion moving across the sky.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.960
Strangely though, Zoe completely misses the beginning of the school shooting.

05:42.960 --> 05:46.960
It unfolds with the quartet of shooters crashing their van into the cafeteria

05:46.960 --> 05:48.560
and firing off a machine gun.

05:48.560 --> 05:50.800
Zoe, who's in the cafeteria washroom,

05:50.800 --> 05:55.760
can't hear any of this over what must be the loudest hand dryer in the history of mankind.

05:55.760 --> 05:57.440
And no one else in the school hears it either.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.040
Classes go about normally.

05:59.040 --> 06:02.880
While I can't speak to the structure of high schools in rural Nebraska,

06:02.880 --> 06:06.160
I have to imagine someone would hear a van smashing into the cafeteria

06:06.160 --> 06:08.160
and the machine gun fire that followed.

06:08.160 --> 06:10.240
We then meet the villains of the movie.

06:10.240 --> 06:13.280
Their leader, Tristan, played by Eli Brown,

06:13.280 --> 06:17.280
is instantly unlikable as he acts like a cheesy action movie villain.

06:17.280 --> 06:22.160
I suppose we're meant to hate him, but I just wanted him off my screen.

06:22.160 --> 06:24.400
Tristan has a master plan to shoot up the school.

06:24.400 --> 06:29.120
You see, those explosions earlier were planted by him and his pals to distract the cops.

06:29.120 --> 06:31.280
They then disable the school's internal systems,

06:31.280 --> 06:35.040
arrange a livestream, and plant even more explosives around the school.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.760
These are surprisingly competent school shooters.

06:37.760 --> 06:40.480
If this nefarious plot sounds a little familiar to you,

06:40.480 --> 06:43.760
it's probably because Tristan also happens to be the Joker.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.120
His scheming is very similar to the Joker's in The Dark Knight,

06:47.120 --> 06:49.120
who plows a bus into a bank,

06:49.120 --> 06:51.840
has his minions disrupt the building's internal systems,

06:51.840 --> 06:54.640
and disguises himself as one of his victims to escape.

06:54.640 --> 06:58.480
There's also an echo of the classic Joker with one of Tristan's followers

06:58.480 --> 07:03.280
being this goth-like Harley Quinn figure Anna, played by Catherine Davis.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.880
And if you look closely, Tristan's gait kind of looks like the one

07:06.880 --> 07:08.800
Keith Ledger is doing in The Dark Knight.

07:08.800 --> 07:11.040
To be fair though, if someone did try to shoot up a school,

07:11.040 --> 07:14.080
I wouldn't be surprised if they thought of themselves as the Joker too.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.400
I would have guessed the Joaquin Phoenix version.

07:16.400 --> 07:19.680
Tristan's motivations are a bit less interesting than the Joker's though.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.800
He wants to be famous. On social media.

07:22.800 --> 07:26.240
And instead of starting a YouTube channel where he complains about women in Star Wars,

07:26.240 --> 07:29.440
he's decided to create the definitive school shooting.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.080
Okay? Everybody watching is culpable.

07:32.080 --> 07:34.720
You all post, and you tweet, and you share.

07:35.360 --> 07:38.800
Everybody jumps at the chance to be both judge and jury, but in that system...

07:38.800 --> 07:42.400
Be sure that you created a job opening.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.280
An executioner.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.120
You created me.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.160
And what does it for you?

07:52.880 --> 07:53.380
Uh...

07:56.320 --> 07:58.000
Being definitive.

07:59.840 --> 08:03.120
And creating the ultimate version of something.

08:03.120 --> 08:06.160
The only interesting thing about Tristan is that, secretly,

08:06.720 --> 08:08.400
I think he's a conservative.

08:08.400 --> 08:10.640
Here are a few telltale lines of dialogue.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.800
We get a cheesy joke about trigger warnings.

08:15.200 --> 08:16.000
Trigger warnings.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.840
He laughs at how inept school security is without a gun.

08:19.840 --> 08:23.600
As if it's not sad enough that they're only paying them $12 an hour to protect our school,

08:23.600 --> 08:25.680
they expect you to do without a f***ing gun?

08:25.680 --> 08:27.520
And we get this little nugget to see a lip.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.080
It's not that hard to build a wall.

08:30.080 --> 08:35.040
Looking at the film's protagonist and her love interest, Lewis, played by Holly Shulerton,

08:35.040 --> 08:39.120
I can't help but think that if this movie hadn't been distributed by the Daily Wire,

08:39.120 --> 08:42.640
we'd be hearing cries of Mary Sue and forced diversity.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.400
We'd probably hear some anger over all the villains being white too.

08:47.360 --> 08:51.200
That is, if anyone would care about this movie to begin with.

08:51.200 --> 08:54.800
Going back to the school shooters though, each of them is surprisingly uninteresting.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.800
Anna is Tristan's girlfriend.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.760
And that sums up her whole character.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.720
Oh, and she smokes weed, I guess that's another thing.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.960
Then we have Kip, played by Cyrus Arnold,

09:08.960 --> 09:12.320
who fell under Tristan's sway because someone pulled his pants down

09:12.320 --> 09:14.400
in front of the whole school a couple of years ago.

09:15.040 --> 09:20.800
Kip has a baffling redemption arc where a two-minute talk from Zoe leads him to betraying Tristan.

09:20.800 --> 09:25.360
He still ends up dying though, albeit so we can buy Zoe a few moments to escape a tight spot.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.920
Most tragic though is Chris, played by Britain Seer.

09:29.920 --> 09:33.680
He's Anna's brother, and apparently also romantically involved with Tristan.

09:33.680 --> 09:36.800
I'm not sure how the dynamics of this relationship work,

09:36.800 --> 09:40.960
but more importantly, Chris has some kind of severe mental health condition.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.040
The movie never says what exactly,

09:43.040 --> 09:44.880
though it seems like schizophrenia.

09:44.880 --> 09:50.560
He's one of those characters who's less a character and more just a collection of walking symptoms.

09:50.560 --> 09:53.280
And it makes him an easy tool to be used by Tristan,

09:53.280 --> 09:57.680
until he's eventually shot by Zoe's father, played by Thomas Jane.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.920
He was hanging around outside the school with a sniper rifle because that's what army dads do,

10:01.920 --> 10:02.640
I guess.

10:02.640 --> 10:06.320
Chris is easily one of the worst depictions of someone with a mental health condition.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.400
I've seen in quite a while.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.120
You might notice that all the antagonists are paper thin,

10:11.120 --> 10:13.280
with weak or no motivations at all.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.760
That's because a big part of this movie's intent,

10:15.760 --> 10:20.240
according to the writer-director Kyle Rankin, was to not glamorize the shooter.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.120
The fact that this movie could only shift the focus away from the shooter

10:23.120 --> 10:26.800
by creating a completely artificial scenario that let a hero step in

10:26.800 --> 10:29.760
speaks to how removed from reality this whole movie is.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.920
Which is especially ironic because many of the positive reviews I've read for this movie,

10:33.920 --> 10:37.760
and even comments in post-movie discussion, highlight the realism of it.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.240
One of Zoe's early encounters with one of the shooters

10:40.240 --> 10:43.840
is when Anna gets the drop on her as Zoe is trying to warn classrooms

10:43.840 --> 10:45.600
about the shooting in the cafeteria.

10:45.600 --> 10:50.560
Zoe is shot in the leg but still somehow manages to get the drop on Anna, turning her own gun on her.

10:50.560 --> 10:53.680
The movie keeps going for a good 40 minutes after Zoe has been shot

10:53.680 --> 10:57.280
as she runs around the school, takes down the other shooters, and saves her classmates.

10:57.280 --> 11:01.360
A teacher at one point, instead of telling her student, who has a gunshot wound by the way,

11:01.360 --> 11:04.000
to get to safety and maybe get medical attention,

11:04.000 --> 11:05.920
instead goes with her on her mission.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.320
Somehow this is meant to be realistic.

11:08.320 --> 11:10.960
I think more likely the conservative audience,

11:10.960 --> 11:14.640
obviously curated from the Daily Wire readers,

11:14.640 --> 11:18.320
are seeing a version of reality they would rather was true,

11:18.320 --> 11:22.160
instead of the more tragic reality of what happens at an actual school shooting.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.000
But what I found most objectionable,

11:24.000 --> 11:28.880
the part where this movie fully devolves into psycho-territory, happens in its final minutes.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.720
It's a callback to the opening scene where we can see Zoe and her father hunting a deer.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.200
The deer is mortally wounded but not killed,

11:35.360 --> 11:38.800
and as Thomas Jane delivers a monologue about putting an animal out of its misery,

11:38.800 --> 11:42.880
Zoe smashes a rock on the deer's head to reveal she is a troubled person,

11:42.880 --> 11:45.040
still dealing with the recent death of her mother.

11:45.040 --> 11:48.560
In the final moments of the movie, we find out Tristan has given the cops the slip,

11:48.560 --> 11:51.120
and is slowly sneaking away from the scene of the crime.

11:51.120 --> 11:55.680
Even though dozens of kids have seen his face and his only disguise is an orange baseball cap,

11:55.680 --> 11:57.040
he nearly makes it out.

11:57.040 --> 11:58.960
It's only Zoe who spots him.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.880
Instead of telling the cops about it, she grabs her dad's rifle,

12:02.880 --> 12:06.160
stalks Tristan, and then shoots him like a wild animal.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.200
As he bleeds out, she walks towards him,

12:09.200 --> 12:13.360
repeating her father's monologue from the first scene about putting an animal out of its misery,

12:13.360 --> 12:15.760
but instead of smashing the rock on Tristan's head,

12:27.040 --> 12:30.720
Zoe's transformation in this movie is to go from troubled teen and mourning,

12:30.800 --> 12:33.920
pulling away from life, to the hero fully engaged with life,

12:33.920 --> 12:38.000
who also happens to enjoy watching villains suffering a miserable death.

12:38.000 --> 12:41.680
There's something disturbing and sadistic about an ending like this.

12:41.680 --> 12:45.440
In the hands of a more competent filmmaker, the ending could have highlighted how even

12:45.440 --> 12:49.200
being a hero in a school shooting creates a trauma that shatters all the good and

12:49.200 --> 12:50.640
compassion out of a person.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.600
The ending would be tragic, even if it seemed like justice.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.800
But in this film, Zoe's path is presented as righteous,

12:56.800 --> 12:59.520
and her growth is framed as something to be celebrated.

12:59.520 --> 13:03.680
She's letting go of the pain of losing her mother and finding a reason to live in helping

13:03.680 --> 13:06.240
people, but no one was helped in this final scene.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.920
It was her needlessly doling out her own brand of justice.

13:09.920 --> 13:13.920
Much like the death of Kip, who is on the path to redemption, the movie seems to be

13:13.920 --> 13:18.960
operating under the idea that committing these crimes requires a swift punishment,

13:18.960 --> 13:20.720
in this case, a death sentence.

13:22.080 --> 13:25.680
It certainly falls in line with an earlier scene where a religious student,

13:25.680 --> 13:28.400
who only speaks in this scene, has a moment with Tristan

13:29.040 --> 13:29.520
Free will.

13:33.440 --> 13:35.840
God allows the wicked to do their wickedness.

13:37.360 --> 13:38.160
Oh yeah, why's that?

13:40.240 --> 13:41.200
So they can be judged.

13:44.080 --> 13:50.080
Tristan's death is supposed to be viewed as an act of justice, but to me it only reads tragically.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.520
This movie, for all its errors of being popcorn entertainment,

13:53.520 --> 13:57.120
with vague allusions to heroism in the face of tragedy,

13:57.200 --> 14:01.760
can't escape the sad truth that, even in some kind of absurd power fantasy,

14:01.760 --> 14:07.040
a school shooting will still end in tragedy, and the movie's veneer of justice being served

14:07.040 --> 14:10.960
reveals a shallow excuse for how tragedies scar the survivors.

14:11.520 --> 14:16.480
If this movie had been deliberately moving to this ending on that sour downbeat note,

14:16.480 --> 14:18.000
it might have won me over.

14:18.000 --> 14:23.040
But as it is, this feels like my reading attempting to salvage what is otherwise a

14:23.040 --> 14:24.880
completely forgettable movie.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.920
On the night of its North American premiere, after the movie's screened,

14:27.920 --> 14:31.440
there was a short discussion with one of the movie's producers, Dallas Sonnier,

14:31.440 --> 14:33.520
and the movie's writer and director, Kyle Rankin.

14:34.080 --> 14:37.840
While watching the movie, one thing that was incredibly apparent was how shallow

14:37.840 --> 14:39.600
the motivations were for the shooters.

14:39.600 --> 14:43.680
In this conversation, we find out that's what drew Ben Shapiro to the movie in the first place.

14:43.680 --> 14:45.440
We need to treat them for the villains they are.

14:45.440 --> 14:48.880
It can't be all about, you know, their tough childhoods, as you were suggesting,

14:48.880 --> 14:52.480
or the sort of crippling circumstances they went through, look how tough life is for them.

14:52.480 --> 14:52.800
The film, actually.

14:52.800 --> 14:54.720
The focus in this film is really on the victims.

14:54.720 --> 14:56.160
It really, really is on the victim.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.920
It's weird to hear that, because the focus isn't really on the victims at all.

14:59.920 --> 15:03.520
Most of the victims are faceless students we never even learn the names of.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.720
If we compare this movie to one of the earlier movies about school shootings,

15:06.720 --> 15:10.640
Gus Van Sant's 2003 movie, Elephant, we see a dramatically different depiction

15:10.640 --> 15:11.600
of a school shooting.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.080
While both films take place during a single day,

15:14.080 --> 15:16.960
Elephant spends time with over 10 different students,

15:16.960 --> 15:19.520
and most of that time is spent with students who are victims.

15:19.520 --> 15:22.000
My favorite example is the character Michelle.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.800
There's something so incredibly sad about her scenes.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.440
A quiet young girl who often fades into the background.

15:27.440 --> 15:29.840
We don't see her do anything but go about her day,

15:29.840 --> 15:32.160
keeping her head down while trying to get by.

15:32.160 --> 15:36.240
There's one scene where two characters, John and Elias, meet in an empty hallway,

15:36.240 --> 15:38.080
and Elias takes a picture of John.

15:38.080 --> 15:41.040
Since the movie jumps around in the timeline events of the day,

15:41.040 --> 15:42.880
we see this scene three times.

15:42.880 --> 15:47.840
First from John's perspective, then Elias's, and then finally from Michelle's.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.880
In the first two scenes, even though we've been introduced to Michelle already,

15:50.960 --> 15:55.760
we don't even notice she appears in this moment until the focus shifts in that third scene.

15:55.760 --> 16:00.720
It emphasizes that this is a character we don't see until we're directed towards her.

16:00.720 --> 16:05.840
The only time in the movie someone sees Michelle pulling her face from the crowd

16:05.840 --> 16:08.080
is in the library where she's helping out.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.280
The person who sees her is one of the school shooters,

16:11.280 --> 16:14.560
and we find out she's the first victim of the day.

16:14.560 --> 16:17.200
Even though we know very little about the character,

16:17.200 --> 16:20.720
the fact that we know so little reveals how little attention we pay

16:20.720 --> 16:23.040
to the inner lives of teenagers in general.

16:23.040 --> 16:27.440
The movie is making us consider that fact and how it might lead to people like the shooters,

16:27.440 --> 16:30.800
and perhaps more importantly, to value the quiet people around

16:30.800 --> 16:35.120
who we sadly let fade into the background unless they become the face of a tragedy.

16:35.120 --> 16:38.560
We'll never know what kindness or compassion or beauty

16:38.560 --> 16:40.880
might have been within a character like Michelle.

16:40.880 --> 16:43.200
And thanks to the shooters, we never will.

16:44.320 --> 16:45.920
The moment where Michelle is killed

16:45.920 --> 16:48.000
contains so much more tragedy and heartbreak

16:48.000 --> 16:50.640
than the first teen killed in Run, Hide, Fight.

16:50.640 --> 16:54.160
The first teen killed in Run, Hide, Fight is right here,

16:54.160 --> 16:55.920
under the tire of the van.

16:55.920 --> 16:59.440
Well, it's never really explained why the kid crawled under the van.

16:59.440 --> 17:03.200
As we can see clearly in the previous shot, the van didn't run over anybody.

17:03.200 --> 17:04.400
We don't know his name,

17:04.400 --> 17:06.400
or the name of the girl who shot right after him,

17:06.400 --> 17:08.480
or this guy who stabbed next.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.640
They just die in an effort to raise the stakes.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.320
This is a movie that focuses on some of the victims,

17:14.320 --> 17:17.840
but clearly not all victims are considered equal.

17:17.840 --> 17:20.160
The ones who fight back were remembered.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.800
Those who don't, who might have died a death like Michelle,

17:22.800 --> 17:25.440
are destined to be forgotten.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.520
The Daily Wire crew also wants to highlight

17:27.520 --> 17:30.960
how honest this movie is in its depiction of the shooters.

17:30.960 --> 17:34.400
It has a more honest take on the people who perpetrate these crimes

17:34.400 --> 17:38.720
than most even news articles or documentaries that you see.

17:38.720 --> 17:43.440
It's trivially easy to explain how other movies that depict school shootings

17:43.440 --> 17:46.000
provide more thoughtful depictions of the shooters.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.440
I could highlight, for instance,

17:47.440 --> 17:51.840
Il Marag's 2007 movie Class, where a bully befriends his victim

17:51.840 --> 17:54.320
and their friendship fuels school hostilities,

17:54.320 --> 17:56.160
leading them to murder their classmates.

17:56.160 --> 18:00.240
Or I could talk about Matthew Johnson's 2013 movie The Dirties,

18:00.240 --> 18:03.600
where a teenage boy's outsider status and obsession with movies

18:03.600 --> 18:06.800
detach him from reality, eventually leading to tragedy.

18:06.800 --> 18:08.880
Movies like these two make genuine attempts

18:08.880 --> 18:10.880
to examine the psychology of school shooters

18:10.880 --> 18:14.000
and the impact alienation from their peer group has on them.

18:14.000 --> 18:17.280
Run, Hide, Fight gives us very little in the way of backstory

18:17.280 --> 18:19.600
for any of the students, aside from Kip.

18:19.600 --> 18:22.800
And in that case, it's used in a conversation that can redeem.

18:22.800 --> 18:25.520
If anything, the film deliberately avoids this type of death

18:25.520 --> 18:27.360
for its characters to prevent the audience

18:27.360 --> 18:29.040
from feeling any sympathy for them.

18:29.040 --> 18:32.240
Boring and Shapiro actually hit it on the head when they say this.

18:32.240 --> 18:36.400
You really took kind of an unflinching look at the evil that you were saying, yeah.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.760
With regard to the shooters,

18:37.760 --> 18:40.640
this movie is trying to display the evil they represent

18:40.640 --> 18:44.160
as something inherent and not the product of circumstances.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.320
Again, echoing the statements of the religious character earlier on,

18:48.320 --> 18:52.480
evil actions are permitted by God so that the evil-doers can be judged.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.360
What made them evil to begin with is never considered.

18:55.360 --> 19:00.240
This reminds me very much of a comment made during the 2008 American election.

19:00.240 --> 19:03.360
The candidates at the time were Barack Obama and John McCain,

19:03.360 --> 19:05.200
and they were both asked about evil.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.960
Obama gave a long-winded response about understanding evil,

19:08.960 --> 19:10.640
the actions we take to confront it,

19:10.640 --> 19:15.840
and how trying to stop what we consider evil can have consequences we would also consider evil.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.600
It's kind of convoluted, you can read it here if you're curious.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.200
John McCain's response, though, was much more terse.

19:23.200 --> 19:27.200
His response to what should be done about evil was to say, defeat it.

19:27.200 --> 19:31.760
I think this represents two fundamentally different ways of looking at the concept of evil.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.760
When the label is applied to a person,

19:33.760 --> 19:37.760
Ben Shapiro, the rest of the Daily Wire crew, and the movie Run, Hide, Fight

19:37.760 --> 19:40.080
clearly fall into the latter camp.

19:40.080 --> 19:44.080
School shooters aren't meant to be something that can be understood or considered through art,

19:44.080 --> 19:49.520
rather they present the opportunity for a simple morality tale of good, triumphing over evil.

19:49.520 --> 19:53.680
One especially revealing part of the discussions that preceded and followed the premiere

19:53.680 --> 19:56.480
is the victims the Daily Wire crew is most concerned with...

19:57.360 --> 19:58.480
Conservatives.

19:58.480 --> 20:02.480
They'll still let you watch their movies, of course, their TV shows, their news, their sports,

20:02.480 --> 20:05.680
but you'll have to do it knowing that everyone who made that content,

20:05.760 --> 20:08.240
at least everyone at the top, hates you.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.440
Replacement institutions for all the institutions that hate our guts.

20:11.440 --> 20:15.040
The left obviously wants to silence and remove voices that they don't agree with.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.560
There are artists on left and right with talent who can express those visions,

20:18.560 --> 20:19.680
but we're not allowed.

20:19.680 --> 20:23.920
We've been, as conservatives, progressively locked out of every single institution, every single one.

20:23.920 --> 20:28.320
This project to bring movies to their audience is fueled by the same victimhood mentality that

20:28.320 --> 20:32.960
runs through all their work. The left controls everything and hates the right with a burning

20:32.960 --> 20:37.600
passion. Of the five people representing the Daily Wire, Jeremy Boring, Andrew Clavin,

20:37.600 --> 20:42.000
Michael Knowles, and Ben Shapiro all have unremarkable careers trying to make it in

20:42.000 --> 20:46.320
the entertainment business. They are also convinced that the reasons they didn't make it

20:46.320 --> 20:50.880
is because conservatives are forbidden into the halls of Hollywood.

20:50.880 --> 20:55.360
While we could play the silly game of counting big conservative stars, such as Clint Eastwood,

20:55.360 --> 21:00.000
it's probably better to look at the creative writing of Ben Shapiro and let that speak to why

21:00.000 --> 21:03.600
he and possibly his buddies didn't make it too far in the world of Hollywood.

21:04.160 --> 21:08.720
With the knowledge of their creative limitations and some obvious bitterness in their critique,

21:08.720 --> 21:13.040
this whole endeavor has a different look to it. It seems less about providing entertainment to an

21:13.040 --> 21:16.960
underserved audience, but rather an attempt to vindicate their own anger at the world of

21:16.960 --> 21:21.360
Hollywood, fighting back with their own movies, created by conservatives.

21:21.360 --> 21:24.480
It very much has a, we'll show them, vibe to it.

21:25.360 --> 21:28.320
Although Kyle Rankin is vague about his political beliefs,

21:28.320 --> 21:31.840
his producer, Dallas Sonnier, is less cagey about it.

21:31.840 --> 21:38.800
I stayed the same. The world went left, right? I stayed here. And so I'm simply making the

21:38.800 --> 21:40.080
movies that I grew up loving.

21:40.080 --> 21:43.200
And when describing the movie, they seem fairly comfortable with it becoming

21:43.200 --> 21:45.520
embraced by a conservative audience.

21:45.520 --> 21:53.120
If the marketplace or the audience determines that the movie is more conservative in its values

21:53.120 --> 21:59.200
or matrix or DNA, then so be it. That's fine with me.

21:59.200 --> 22:03.840
And there's an attempt to frame this movie as enjoyable by a wider audience that presumably

22:03.840 --> 22:08.800
doesn't just include conservatives. If so, it makes me wonder why the only way to see this movie

22:08.800 --> 22:13.440
is to become a member on the Daily Wire website where you would have to pay $14 a month to watch

22:13.440 --> 22:19.360
it. You also get access to some other Daily Wire content, but unless you're a fan of conservative

22:19.360 --> 22:24.480
media, and likely a conservative yourself, there isn't much value in that monthly fee.

22:24.480 --> 22:29.280
One thing it does do, though, is ensure that the audience for Run, Hide, Fight will be primed to

22:29.280 --> 22:35.040
enjoy it. And not simply because they enjoy its quality, but because it's part of a grander project

22:35.040 --> 22:38.000
of fighting back in the culture against the left.

22:38.000 --> 22:42.080
Entertainment that you can not only enjoy, but be proud of knowing that you helped change the

22:42.080 --> 22:44.320
culture. And ultimately, that's the key.

22:44.320 --> 22:48.720
It also means the audience who determine the ratings on Rotten Tomatoes and IMDB

22:48.720 --> 22:52.480
are only coming from a conservative audience who have been primed to enjoy the movie,

22:52.480 --> 22:57.360
and likely may be inflated. And negative reviews of the movie,

22:57.360 --> 23:01.600
well, those are brushed off as being product of the extreme left.

23:02.240 --> 23:10.000
The voices on the extreme left have not been open to the movie. In fact, they've been almost

23:10.000 --> 23:15.600
resistant to it, reviewing when they review it. I don't want to ever single out an individual

23:15.600 --> 23:21.120
review because I don't like it when filmmakers do that. But I saw a systemic

23:22.960 --> 23:30.320
system in the reviews where it felt very much like a concerted effort to review the subject matter

23:31.040 --> 23:34.720
and perceived politics rather than the actual movie.

23:34.720 --> 23:38.480
I can understand the assumption that once The Daily Wire became involved,

23:38.480 --> 23:42.320
the way critics look at this movie would be altered. Heck, I wouldn't be reviewing this

23:42.320 --> 23:45.760
movie at all had I not read the story about The Daily Wire's connection to it.

23:45.760 --> 23:51.600
But to brush off negative criticisms as coming from the extreme left, who are ignoring the

23:51.600 --> 23:57.040
quality of the movie, is absolutely not true. I read every single review of this movie when

23:57.040 --> 24:01.600
it premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September of 2020. That's right, I read

24:02.240 --> 24:07.840
all seven of them. Of those seven, six were negative. Jessica Kiang wrote,

24:07.840 --> 24:13.280
At literally no point in this weirdly lumbering, sluggish movie's narrative does its grotesque,

24:13.280 --> 24:19.120
tastelessness ever appear to have occurred to anyone involved. David Ehrlich wrote,

24:19.120 --> 24:23.920
It's a movie made by someone who's seen too many movies and now made at least one too many as well.

24:24.560 --> 24:29.840
And from Guy Lodge, What would you do? The film tastelessly needles its viewers throughout,

24:29.840 --> 24:33.280
presenting the brawniest, most impossible answer all the while.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.920
These reviews do make note of the subject matter, because how could you not,

24:37.920 --> 24:43.200
but only in the context of how the film depicts it. The one positive review came from Christian

24:43.200 --> 24:48.960
Toto. If there is a message here, it's an honest, unblinking one. Some children are broken as they

24:48.960 --> 24:55.200
near adulthood, a tragic lesson we've learned from real life headlines. Question as to why those

24:55.200 --> 25:00.240
children are broken, though, is for superior movies. This one just wants us to celebrate

25:00.240 --> 25:05.600
another child murdering them. There's a Hunger Games vibe here. It's not just that Isabel May

25:05.600 --> 25:10.960
looks a bit like Jennifer Lawrence. It's that we in the audience are very much like the detached,

25:10.960 --> 25:17.120
rich elites who watch teenagers kill each other. At least we aren't doing it for real. We're doing

25:17.120 --> 25:23.040
it in movies inspired by real life events. In a brief behind the scenes documentary for the movie,

25:23.040 --> 25:27.680
many of the cast members shared their opinions that this movie might be positively read as a

25:27.680 --> 25:32.800
call to action. Not for any sort of political action, of course. Instead, it's to possibly

25:32.800 --> 25:39.200
inspire someone who might face a similar situation to fight back. If we become more proactive,

25:39.200 --> 25:45.040
and it does take a little bit of bravery, it doesn't mean you can't be scared, but to act

25:46.160 --> 25:52.800
proactively is going to save lives. That's a recommendation that's so depressing. I can only

25:52.800 --> 25:56.400
hope they were desperately trying to find something constructive to say, and hadn't

25:56.400 --> 26:01.280
had more than a few moments to think about it. To be clear, I bear no ill will to any actor,

26:01.280 --> 26:05.600
or even some of the crew who are involved in the making of this movie. Everyone's gotta earn a

26:05.600 --> 26:10.960
living somehow, and sometimes you sign up for a movie not necessarily knowing how it's going to

26:10.960 --> 26:16.400
turn out. One particular plot point, or lack thereof, was an explanation as to where these

26:16.400 --> 26:22.160
teenagers got hold of so many guns. They had two pistols, a shotgun, and a machine gun. The machine

26:22.160 --> 26:27.920
gun is an MP40, which is what the Germans used during World War II. A not-so-subtle reminder

26:27.920 --> 26:33.840
that these are the bad guys. The absence of any explanation for where these guns came from seems

26:33.840 --> 26:39.760
to me like an absolute refusal to even speak to the gun culture of the United States. Everyone

26:39.760 --> 26:45.680
has guns, even relics from World War II. This is just a fact of life. And the idea that teenagers

26:45.680 --> 26:51.200
who want to shoot up a school, perhaps, just perhaps, shouldn't be able to put together a

26:51.200 --> 26:56.400
cache of weapons is never really explored. The idea that there might be a problem with the gun

26:56.400 --> 27:01.680
culture of the United States is just one more thing this film does not want us thinking about.

27:01.680 --> 27:06.400
It's ironic hearing the writer, director, or producer, anyone involved with this movie

27:06.400 --> 27:12.480
talking about wanting to start a conversation or dialogue when this film seems entirely uninterested

27:12.480 --> 27:18.960
in presenting even the most basic starting point for a discussion. It was probably best summed up

27:19.040 --> 27:22.880
by, of all people, Matt Walsh. When following the screening, he said this.

27:33.360 --> 27:39.920
The idea of a school shooting being fodder for escapism is a creepy thought. It makes something

27:39.920 --> 27:46.560
that should be upsetting by the nature of its rarity seem commonplace and regular and normal.

27:46.560 --> 27:52.160
It does nothing to even broach the hard questions of why school shootings happen.

27:52.160 --> 27:56.800
Presenting them is something we should turn our brains off for. It does make heroes out of the

27:56.800 --> 28:01.360
victims, though only those who stand and fight against their fellow classmates. It's an ugly

28:01.360 --> 28:07.280
burden to put on teenagers, and one made especially ugly by the movie's embrace of national tragedies.

28:07.840 --> 28:13.840
What we have is a movie that exploits a tragedy to make a cheesy action film,

28:13.840 --> 28:15.920
and it doesn't really do much more than that.

28:17.040 --> 28:21.840
Okay, I need to stop the video right here, right now, for a content warning. I'm going to be

28:21.840 --> 28:27.680
discussing some of the history of the studio that worked on this movie, including some stories

28:27.680 --> 28:32.880
involving animal cruelty and sexual assault. If you're not down for that, feel free to dip out

28:32.880 --> 28:40.160
of the video now. For those who are sticking around, get ready, because things are about to get dark.

28:40.880 --> 28:45.920
This film was produced by a company named Bonfire Legends, though originally it went under a

28:45.920 --> 28:51.280
different banner, Sinistate. A studio with a number of films under its belt, articles about

28:51.280 --> 28:56.480
them describe Sinistate as producing low-budget features for a more conservative audience,

28:56.480 --> 29:00.720
although the company's founder and owner, Dallas Sonnier, resists that characterization,

29:00.720 --> 29:05.840
as he feels his movies are apolitical, which is what conservatives happen to want. Speaking to

29:05.840 --> 29:10.560
the Wall Street Journal, he said, if we can make a movie that does not treat them as losers or ask

29:10.560 --> 29:15.200
how dare they vote a certain way or pander to them, naturally they're going to respond in a

29:15.200 --> 29:19.360
positive way. Originally Run, Hide, Fight was supposed to launch Sinistate's new

29:19.360 --> 29:24.720
Rebelor brand, though between the announcement of these plans in early 2020 and the present day in

29:24.720 --> 29:30.240
2021, things radically changed. The major controversy to hit the studio was regarding

29:30.240 --> 29:35.760
one of its producers, Adam Donaghy. Donaghy joined Sinistate in 2017, working as a line

29:35.760 --> 29:42.240
producer and executive producer on the films The Standoff at Sparrow Creek, VFW, and Satanic Panic.

29:42.240 --> 29:47.200
He was also one of the executive producers on Run, Hide, Fight, before his name was taken off

29:47.200 --> 29:52.800
the film a few months before its premiere. In late April of 2020, Donaghy was arrested

29:52.800 --> 29:58.240
for the sexual assault of a 16-year-old girl. Following this revelation, a number of allegations

29:58.240 --> 30:03.280
regarding sexual harassment became known to the wider public, revealing that this was a well-known

30:03.280 --> 30:08.320
secret within the local Dallas film scene. One of them included a conversation recorded by

30:08.320 --> 30:13.440
Kristen Leah Haynes from 2014, where she was working in the art department of the film

30:13.440 --> 30:19.280
Occupy Texas. At the time, she was 21 years old. In the recording, we can hear Donaghy proposition

30:19.280 --> 30:24.640
Haynes asking to see her underwear and then asking for her to participate in sexual acts.

30:24.640 --> 30:28.960
The recording and Donaghy's reputation were spread throughout the local film community. There

30:28.960 --> 30:33.840
are multiple stories of him aggressively touching or propositioning women on film sets, and he rarely

30:33.840 --> 30:38.560
seemed to face much in the way of consequences. The problem with Donaghy was that he was a line

30:38.560 --> 30:43.440
producer, meaning he was in charge of budgeting for the film. He also, in many cases, served as

30:43.440 --> 30:48.880
a source of financing for films. He was literally writing the checks of his would-be accusers.

30:48.880 --> 30:54.080
And in cases where his actions were brought up to others, they were often minimized or dismissed.

30:54.080 --> 30:58.400
In 2017, Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmick began partnering with Donaghy.

30:58.400 --> 31:02.800
In an article by The Daily Beast, 10 people claimed to have directly reached out to the

31:02.800 --> 31:07.440
heads of Sinistate, Dallas Sonnier and Amanda Presmick, with four of them offering the audio

31:07.440 --> 31:12.240
that Haynes have recorded. Each of these people who approached Sonnier and Presmick said that

31:12.240 --> 31:17.440
their reports fell on deaf ears. Both the producers claimed to have never heard the recording,

31:17.440 --> 31:22.000
and Sonnier admonished Haynes for not making her report through official channels.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.240
When asked about the allegations against his studio, Sonnier said he was largely unaware of

31:26.240 --> 31:28.560
them. Sonnier told The Daily Beast,

31:28.560 --> 31:33.040
We're under siege right now. Everyone involved has their own personal vendettas against us.

31:33.040 --> 31:37.600
They have a history of harassing us and having problems with us. It feels like a targeted hit,

31:37.600 --> 31:41.680
and it feels like an attack. I think people have real issues with us. They have issues with our

31:41.680 --> 31:46.160
success with the amount of movies we've made and in a short time built this company to be something

31:46.240 --> 31:51.440
very special. It feels partisan. When the allegations went public in mid-2020,

31:51.440 --> 31:56.720
two of the publications Sinistate owned, Fangoria and Birth Movies Death, parted ways with the

31:56.720 --> 32:01.440
company. In an interview with Kyle Rankin, the writer and director of Run, Hide, Fight, he

32:01.440 --> 32:06.880
responded to learning about the Donaghy situation, saying, I was blown away. When the news broke,

32:06.880 --> 32:11.200
it was sad and shocking. I believed Sinistate that they didn't know about Adam's past,

32:11.200 --> 32:14.880
and that they were working hard to restructure their company and have very safe sets.

32:14.880 --> 32:18.560
I knew that I ran a very safe set. I knew my side of the street was clean.

32:18.560 --> 32:20.800
I thought I could stick around and affect some change.

32:21.360 --> 32:25.120
Though there are no direct allegations of sexual harassment on the set of a movie,

32:25.120 --> 32:28.960
concerns surrounding the production have been raised. Speaking to the Daily Beast,

32:28.960 --> 32:33.600
the film's second assistant director, Kristen Leah Haynes, the woman who recorded Donaghy

32:33.600 --> 32:38.000
sexually harassing her, said she joined the production as a favor to a friend and because

32:38.000 --> 32:42.800
she needed the work. She said, there was some really sketchy s*** going on on that movie.

32:43.440 --> 32:49.040
Haynes, who was only on set a few days, was also assured that she would be kept far from Donaghy.

32:49.040 --> 32:53.120
Several of the staff walked off the set of the movie, including the first assistant director,

32:53.120 --> 32:56.480
Meg Beatty, and key hair and makeup artist, Madeline Rose.

32:57.040 --> 33:02.000
In Rose's case, she mentions the reason for her departure had to do with the film's opening scene,

33:02.000 --> 33:06.640
where we see Zoe and her father hunting a deer. What bothered Rose about this scene was that this

33:06.640 --> 33:12.160
was no special effect. This was a very real deer that was shot on camera for the movie.

33:12.160 --> 33:17.440
She describes it. They hired a local hunter, went on his land, and filmed the deer being shot.

33:17.440 --> 33:21.120
Then they took the deer and froze it so they could pull it out again for close-ups with

33:21.120 --> 33:26.800
the actual actors. In the Daily Beast article, Sonia claims it was the legal harvest of a

33:26.800 --> 33:31.520
registered buck, and that SAG-AFTRA took no issue with the incident.

33:32.320 --> 33:37.600
Rose voiced her concerns over the deer to Donaghy, and she describes the encounter saying,

33:37.600 --> 33:42.400
He went off on me in a very condescending way. He got very heated and told me I was either with

33:42.400 --> 33:48.960
them or against them. Rose, who had been unfamiliar with the earlier allegations against Donaghy,

33:48.960 --> 33:54.080
quit the film the following day. Although the deer incident was unknown to the Daily Wire crew

33:54.080 --> 33:58.800
when they purchased the rights to distribute this movie, Jeremy Boring did speak to knowing

33:58.800 --> 34:03.440
about the incidents regarding Donaghy, having read the earlier Daily Beast article describing

34:03.440 --> 34:08.880
the history of sexual harassment and assault on sets Donaghy had worked on. Boring said,

34:08.880 --> 34:13.680
To the extent that things may have taken place in the production of this film or another film,

34:14.240 --> 34:18.640
I don't think it's my business. In the same way, it's not my business if something takes place at

34:18.640 --> 34:23.440
any other kind of company that I buy product from. I'm sure there have been allegations of sexual

34:23.440 --> 34:27.360
harassment at almost every major product company in the country. That doesn't mean the product

34:27.360 --> 34:31.680
itself has to be banned. Those things, to the extent that anything did happen,

34:32.320 --> 34:37.440
didn't happen under my watch. The Daily Wire's first foray into the world of entertainment

34:37.440 --> 34:41.520
is to ensure that the North American audience will get the chance to see a movie that would

34:41.520 --> 34:46.160
have likely gone straight to video on demand. Only instead of appearing on Stars or Hulu,

34:46.160 --> 34:51.600
Run, Hide, Fight is on the same streaming platform as video podcasts of Ben Shapiro

34:51.600 --> 34:54.000
complaining about the Babysitter's Club show on Netflix.

35:01.680 --> 35:15.120
And that seems like the perfect place for this movie.

35:17.920 --> 35:22.240
I'm honestly surprised at how much I had to say about this movie. When I watched it,

35:22.240 --> 35:27.360
it was surprisingly uninteresting. And when I watched it again the following day,

35:27.360 --> 35:31.760
I was amazed at how much I had forgotten. It's surprisingly unmemorable as a movie.

35:32.320 --> 35:38.000
Not even in a so bad it's amusing way, it's just sort of whatever. Your life will not have been

35:38.000 --> 35:43.360
enriched in any way for having watched it. One thing I didn't cover in the video were the

35:43.360 --> 35:48.880
horrible working conditions for a lot of its crew members, often paid very low wage, and they were

35:48.880 --> 35:55.360
often asked to work very long hours. There was another incident where an older actor was

35:55.360 --> 36:01.440
considered too expensive to replace when after he sexually harassed some women in the makeup

36:01.440 --> 36:06.800
department, including trying to grope one of them. According to one of the people involved,

36:06.800 --> 36:14.160
Sonya's response was to suggest that the women start using the buddy system to avoid being groped.

36:14.160 --> 36:17.600
There were other stories of people who hadn't gone on the record and that were tougher to source,

36:17.600 --> 36:21.520
but overall they seemed like a pretty shady company, in other words a perfect fit for the

36:21.520 --> 36:27.040
daily wire. I want to thank all my lovely patrons and members whose names are scrolling up on the
