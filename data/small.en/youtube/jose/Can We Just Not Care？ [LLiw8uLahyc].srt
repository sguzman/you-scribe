1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,620
The world is weird, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it, with Jose.

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:12,900
In the first episode of the 1999 animated series Futurama, a delivery boy named Fry

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,340
gets transported 1,000 years into the future.

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:20,660
When he's outfitted for a chip that will forever brand him as a delivery boy, it's

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,740
done so under the auspices of the motto, you gotta do what you gotta do.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,500
This image perfectly captures the idea of being swallowed up by a system that will make

7
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:34,060
every decision for you, and you can only resign yourself to the idea that this is how

8
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,340
the world works.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:41,340
Terms like these carry this deep resignation that the world is the way it is, and change

10
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:44,220
just isn't gonna happen.

11
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,740
Some of the most popular political content on YouTube can fall under the category of

12
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:53,660
owning the libs, anti-SJW commentary, taking down the right, or some other adversarial

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,660
position.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:58,740
It tries to create the idea of a political position not so much around what a person

15
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:03,140
believes, but what that person perceives themselves as standing up against.

16
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,860
Over the past few weeks, some of the major controversies in the social media space have

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,180
been manufactured nonsense, from the potato head rebranding to some old Dr. Seuss book

18
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,260
no longer being published, but you can see similar narratives cropping around real stories,

19
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,580
such as the recent shooting in Atlanta.

20
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:22,420
Discussions about issues regarding the LGBT community, race, and gender are immediately

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,520
waved aside.

22
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,020
The problem isn't just that figures on the right lie about this stuff, the bigger issue

23
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,180
is that they're telling their audience that it's not something worth caring about to

24
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:35,340
begin with, and those who do claim to care about it are either hypocrites or cultists.

25
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,580
The innuendo studio's YouTube channel has a couple of videos on this topic from its

26
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,740
alt-right playbook series, particularly how rhetoric is used to control conversations

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:44,740
using a barrage of accusations.

28
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,140
It's why so many of the stories I mentioned above are always framed as attacks.

29
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,220
It's never an issue explored, it's always phrased as the left, or hysterical and out

30
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,380
of control when no one would even know about these issues if it wasn't for some right-wing

31
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,340
loudmouth bringing them up first.

32
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,700
What I want to focus on is not just how the right engages with this debate, but how there's

33
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,400
this implicit effort to get people to disengage entirely from the world of politics.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,820
One of the most effective ways of controlling public conversation is convincing people not

35
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,620
to engage in it, at least not honestly.

36
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,380
Back when I made my big video on Dave Rubin many years ago, one of the weirdest things

37
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,300
about his content was how often he said he didn't want to be talking about politics.

38
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:26,100
It's a line I saw repeated by the likes of Tim Poole, The Quartering, or anyone who

39
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,460
serves a young right-wing audience.

40
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,780
This idea that they really wish they didn't have to talk about any of this stuff, but

41
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,680
if it wasn't just for those darn people on the left, we could ignore it and go back

42
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,820
to talking about fun things.

43
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:42,780
Carried with that is this idea that caring about this stuff is not really worthy of attention,

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:47,020
if not for the rabble-rousers, who are supposedly not coming from an honest place.

45
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:49,780
And the reason they tell their audience to care about now is because it's a threat

46
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,260
to the status quo.

47
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:55,900
State into this mindset is the idea that the world is essentially buying the way it

48
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,900
is.

49
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:01,460
Injustices are rare, local, and handled by the systems we have in place.

50
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:05,940
Maybe we need some tweaks, sometimes there's a bad apple, but things are actually pretty

51
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,620
good right now and we don't have to worry about any sort of systemic changes.

52
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,580
If someone feels satisfied in their life, they're a lot less likely to become politically

53
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,580
active.

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,180
And if they're told the world is fine, aside from the rabble-rousers, that's another incentive

55
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:23,220
to just tune out and not really engage with politics.

56
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:27,100
And I know that sounds counterproductive if you're trying to win an election, but it

57
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,820
also pairs with the fact that some people know there are problems in their lives and

58
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,060
the world isn't perfectly fine when there are people who are struggling.

59
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,780
Most of those problems will be filed under the idea that this is just the way the world

60
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:43,300
works, best to just accept it, be a grownup, and move on.

61
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,100
But if the person is still annoyed because, well, there's a lot about the world that

62
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,620
sucks, a villain needs to be created.

63
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,540
So if anything bad happens, it's probably the left's fault.

64
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,940
Their audience is motivated into action only against the perceived threat to their status

65
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,940
quo.

66
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:01,340
Things were always fine before they changed.

67
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:05,500
That's the essence of right-wing messaging, because, of course, it's maintaining the

68
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,340
status quo or possibly some reactionary stuff to move things backwards.

69
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,340
It's never the system that's the problem.

70
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,020
It's the bad actor or actors who have ruined it.

71
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:17,820
It's how an unjust police killing is framed as one bad apple rather than symbolic of

72
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,220
a systemic problem.

73
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,140
Or if a scientific body is saying you need to change how you think about something, it's

74
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,900
probably been infiltrated by some provocateurs.

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,420
The system is fine.

76
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:31,800
It's just some rotten agents who have somehow corrupted it from within.

77
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,340
And if we just get rid of a couple of bad people, we can go back to not talking about

78
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:40,220
these things and not really caring, because things are fine in the status quo.

79
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,020
That's why the aforementioned controversies are framed as an attack by the left.

80
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,020
They're signaling to their audience that caring about this stuff is silly, and only

81
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,980
silly people on the left do it.

82
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,700
But if we let this slide, we could very well end up in some kind of 1984-esque hellscape.

83
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:59,780
Notice that, in all of that rhetoric, no political actions are really espoused aside from some

84
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,860
vague references to principles like free speech.

85
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:08,100
There are no policy ideas or broader initiatives, just a vague hatred for the other side, because

86
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,660
why would you need to motivate someone into political action when your politics are based

87
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,500
on keeping things the same?

88
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:18,020
Here's what apathetic political engagement would look like.

89
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:23,260
One morning, there will be a story all over social media about how the left, those scoundrels,

90
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:26,660
have decided that Paddington Bear is now a female bear.

91
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,580
The right-wing Pundo Sphere, all in unison, will start talking about how the left is out

92
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:37,380
of control, and if this is to stand, soon the nation and the West will all fall.

93
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,380
When the audience laps it up, they might even up with their donations.

94
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,700
The mainstream press reports on it, with some confusion as to why anyone would care about

95
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:48,220
this, but still, you know, reporting on it because they're hungry for the ratings.

96
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,220
And this eventually filters up to opportunistic politicians, who will give speeches designed

97
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,620
specifically for Twitter, where they decry that poor Paddington Bear will now be a she

98
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,460
instead of a he.

99
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:03,020
The big winners in all of this are the right-wing media people who get clicks, the mainstream

100
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:06,340
media who get ratings, and politicians who might get a few votes.

101
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:10,700
A few votes, by the way, based on sharing a common interest, not because they're proposing

102
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:15,820
some kind of Paddington-centric legislation, or even if they draw up that bill because

103
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,340
the story lasts a little longer than New Cycle than most, it'll probably be shot down and

104
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,300
quickly forgotten because, really, this is all performance theater.

105
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,280
What exactly are the politics of all of this?

106
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,220
As best I can tell from this scenario I just made up, it would be that the left is terrible

107
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,660
and trying to change things, when things should never be changed, with subtle digs

108
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,960
at women and the LGBT community for good measure.

109
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,240
This isn't really a coherent political ideology, it's just a brief exercise of rage designed

110
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,780
to whip everyone into a frenzy before they settle back down and go back to the world

111
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,260
ready to let it resume unchanged.

112
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,600
It's basically the two-minute hate from 1984.

113
00:06:56,600 --> 00:07:01,140
And I now demand bonus points for making a 1984 reference that isn't completely played

114
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:03,900
out and actually makes sense.

115
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,920
Politics should be about something, you know, a goal, some kind of achievable end.

116
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:14,120
This anger that's stoked is designed to get people riled up without them actually channeling

117
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:16,120
that anger to something constructive.

118
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,200
Aside from, you know, providing monetary support to the right-wing media system and voting

119
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,160
for politicians who will do absolutely nothing for them.

120
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,560
In one of the rare instances where one of these stories can break through, it's in

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,680
service to a power structure trying to maintain the status quo, such as a government pressure

122
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,260
in a university to remove certain courses from its curriculum or removing training that

123
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:38,220
raises issues of systemic inequalities.

124
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:42,480
Political victory here looks like silencing the other side of the debate in an effort

125
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,720
to maintain the status quo.

126
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,420
This is also why conservative commentators often frame their critiques of these issues

127
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,420
so dishonestly.

128
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:54,560
They present these issues to their audience as nonsensical as a way of signaling to them

129
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,980
that these issues can be safely ignored and discarded.

130
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,420
Giving these ideas honestly would force this side to genuinely engage with them, but by

131
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:06,980
not doing that, they can infectively make their audience misinformed, disengaged, and

132
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:09,960
apathetic towards any sort of social change.

133
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,800
Another way this takes shape that's very similar to apathy is cynicism.

134
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,120
While it exists across the political spectrum, I think it's much stronger on the right.

135
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,360
The ethos of, that's just the way the world is, without ever exploring the thought on

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
the way the world can be.

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,320
And while there is reason to use cynicism, the world is a rough place, and progress doesn't

138
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:30,920
always work out, there's a difference between acknowledging that reality and becoming a

139
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,420
cynic yourself.

140
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:35,840
When you can transform people into cynics, that's really advantageous to anyone trying

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,900
to maintain the status quo.

142
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,300
So it shouldn't be a surprise that it's the tool most often deployed by people who have

143
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,540
the most to lose if the system were changed.

144
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:48,140
It's not a coincidence that so much billionaire money funds these fringe right-wing outlets.

145
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,580
From PragerU to The Daily Wire, these media companies can trace their origins to investments

146
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:56,460
from fracking and oil industries that are looking for a slick outlet that will fight

147
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,480
to ensure regulations are imposed upon industries that make climate change worse and undermine

148
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,580
investment in renewable energy.

149
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:07,140
This can mean everything from spreading lies about climate change to relentlessly attacking

150
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,880
politicians seeking to implement policies that would reduce carbon emissions.

151
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,480
In other words, they fight to maintain the status quo.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,440
As a side note, I would like to say that this doesn't mean that Dennis Prager or Ben Shapiro

153
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,680
are necessarily frauds doing it for the money.

154
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,040
I suppose it could be true.

155
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,000
The main point is, the reason these guys are funded is because they say the things the

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,320
energy billionaires want them to say, whether or not it's genuine or not, misses the whole

157
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,000
point of why they exist in the first place.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:37,660
The point of channels like these are to confuse political activism as engaging with the channels

159
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,660
themselves.

160
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,580
That is to say, you are achieving some kind of political goal by consuming the content

161
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,580
they produce.

162
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:47,900
In effect, you are helping to dunk on the libs by watching one of these videos.

163
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,160
You aren't advocating for policy change, of course.

164
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,180
You aren't encouraging political activism.

165
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,060
You're just pointing and laughing at someone.

166
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,220
And the world can use on without any major changes.

167
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,140
Which is the whole point.

168
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,020
That's the sinister nature of these channels, all the while collecting subscriber fees and

169
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,860
advertising dollars along the way, and directing you to vote for the occasional politician

170
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,020
who will help their donors make a few extra billion dollars.

171
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:13,120
And who wouldn't feel cynical seeing a business model like that laid out?

172
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,020
The truth is a depressing thing sometimes, but I hope that no one watching this would

173
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,280
ever consider giving in to a power imbalance like that on the basis of the idea that this

174
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,720
is how the world works.

175
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,520
Apathy and cynicism are poison to the left.

176
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,520
It discourages activism and encourages disengagement.

177
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:35,000
It's never expressly endorsed, but as I hope I've demonstrated, is implicit in a lot of

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
conservative media.

179
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,800
While you might be able to debate someone on facts or reach them through emotion, it's

180
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:44,720
a lot harder when the very idea of caring about something is made distasteful.

181
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,480
Or the only things people seem to care about are standing in opposition to some perceived

182
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,480
enemy.

183
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:54,960
Particularly, I hate how the left's compassion and kindness are presented as disingenuous

184
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,080
or manipulative, as if no one could truly believe these things.

185
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:03,240
It's certainly possible to believe these things if you're willing to actually have some empathy

186
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:08,320
and concern for the people around you, and sometimes even the people you've never met.

187
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,080
One of the nice things about caring is if you believe in it, and you do it, it's true.

188
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,280
Certainly I've been just as guilty of this as anyone, and I'm not convinced it's necessarily

189
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:22,680
a bad thing entirely, pointing out how full of crap people are is important, but pointing

190
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,240
out how wrong someone is isn't the same thing as having a political ideology.

191
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,720
It's also something that hurts us more than it hurts the right.

192
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,000
We need to organize and create action to change the world for the better, and they don't.

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,560
What do we do, Jose?

194
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,160
Tell us the answers.

195
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,620
If you would like to know a starting point, I would suggest you look as local as possible.

196
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,920
This is where you'll have the strongest impact as an individual.

197
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,960
Think about the issues that matter most to you, and join local organizations that engage

198
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:56,160
with them, whether it's something like environmentalism, or labor reforms, or social justice issues

199
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,480
more broadly.

200
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,200
Look at public forums like city council meetings, or residence association meetings, anywhere

201
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,480
where people are offered an open forum to discuss the issues that matter to them, and

202
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,880
meet other people who care about the same things.

203
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,240
Even something as simple as attending a protest can make a difference.

204
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:15,560
Try to think of it as joining a group, a community that can help change the world around

205
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
you.

206
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,360
Because when you find more of those people who are like you and want to change things,

207
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,320
you'll realize you actually have a lot of power when you work together.

208
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,360
However you decide to use your political consciousness, I just want you to try to be constructively

209
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:30,880
engaged, and as terrible as the world is sometimes, you can't afford the luxury of not caring

210
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,640
enough to want to make the world a better place.

211
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:37,560
Humanity has been slowly improving itself over generations, but it never got better

212
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,960
by not caring.

213
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,280
This is a short video, I know people like the shorter ones, but I try not to make them

214
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:47,040
unless they have something I actually want to say, and this is something that's been

215
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,800
on the back of my mind for a while.

216
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,020
You can join the lovely people whose names are floating up the screen, those are my patrons

217
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:57,600
and members, they don't just get their names in the credits, although that's pretty awesome

218
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,600
right?

219
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,520
They also get early access to videos and download things to my theme songs.

220
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,400
It's all super cool.

221
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:09,440
If you'd like to support the channel in a non-monetary fashion, you can like, comment,

subscribe, and hit the bell for notifications.

223
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,280
If you don't know what to comment, why not tell me your favorite song that's a cover

224
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,480
of another song?

225
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,280
Thank you everyone for watching!
