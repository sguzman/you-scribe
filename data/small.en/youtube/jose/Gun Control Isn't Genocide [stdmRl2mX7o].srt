1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
Wow, there's a title for you. Gun control is not genocide.

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:09,680
That seems like a non-controversial opinion, if I've ever seen one.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,520
I came up with it after watching the video I want to talk about today.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,400
I think we might have a disagreement here.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,840
Does anyone remember Mike Adams? He's the self-styled health ranger who

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,680
produces a stream of nonsense for the website Natural News.

7
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,840
Natural News is a crackpot website that does its best to misunderstand science

8
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:37,360
and fear-monger scary scientific terms. It was popularized by fellow voice

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,600
howling in the wilderness and angriest man on the planet, Alex Jones.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,840
We know we're under attack! We know it! We're breaking the conditioning!

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,880
Ahh! Ahh! We're coming for you, globalist! Ahh! Coming for you!

12
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,920
Coming for you! We know what you're doing!

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,040
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,840
Back in August of 2012, Adams produced a mini-documentary titled

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
Gun Control is Genocide. It's actually part two of a series,

16
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,600
but I'll mention part one a little later.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,200
Whenever there's a renewed push for gun control legislation,

18
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,520
Infowars trots out this gun control is genocide documentary and the cycle of stupid is renewed.

19
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,280
You might not recognize it from YouTube because YouTube deleted the entire Natural News channel

20
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,480
back on March 3rd of 2018, but the mini-documentary lives on in the much sketchier domain of Vimeo.

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:40,960
It's only about eight minutes, but, well, I wouldn't even recommend wasting that much time.

22
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,040
Let's just talk about why it's nonsense.

23
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:49,200
A democracy is based on the fundamental concept that a distribution of power among the many

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,400
creates a better society. It is the concentration of power among the few,

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:02:00,080
such as what we see in a dictatorship that leads to corruption and exploitation of the people.

26
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:06,720
Adams not only gets the idea of a monopoly of force wrong, he also gets democracy wrong.

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,120
In the United States and most other countries in the world, from Canada to China, the government

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,800
already has a monopoly of force, more commonly understood as a monopoly of violence. The basic

29
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,440
idea is that individuals living in a state understand that only the state can claim a

30
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,560
legitimate use of force against citizens. There are laws in most countries against assault

31
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,720
and murder, and typically when a crime is committed, it's the police who handle it,

32
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,600
and not an angry mob or vigilante. There are exceptions in case of self-defense,

33
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:43,200
but generally speaking, most modern nations have a state monopoly on violence.

34
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,000
And as for how Adams gets democracy wrong, when he says the sharing of power, that's

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,880
not really the same as the sharing of weaponry. It means the distribution of political power,

36
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:59,440
usually through voting. I can't believe I have to explain this, but democracies don't choose

37
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,160
their elected officials by one side threatening the other with guns. True global anti-gun movement

38
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:11,760
would see governments abandoning the use of force against the people. The armed raids on

39
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,960
California raw milk producers, for example, or the use of guns to force parents to vaccinate

40
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,960
their children against their will are all the result of a monopoly of force in the hands of

41
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,720
the government. This part's kinda nice. It's important to understand that not all state violence

42
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,480
is good, and while the monopoly on violence is probably better than vigilantes running around

43
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,520
taking care of whatever they deem necessary, it's telling that in this documentary the best

44
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:45,280
examples Adams could come up with were raids against raw milk farms and vaccination. I'm not

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,480
sure anyone is being vaccinated at gunpoint, and the only evidence of that I could find was this

46
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,080
painting by an artist from Sesame Street magazine. No joke, the guy who drew this used to do work for

47
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
Sesame Street magazine, until they realized he was a crazy dude and they just kinda cut him off.

48
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:07,920
So there are great examples of the government using its monopoly of violence irresponsibly.

49
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,760
For instance, when you see an unarmed man shot by police, usually black. Of course,

50
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,480
this video was made in 2012, before Black Lives Matters really came into the spotlight.

51
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,280
What are Health Ranger Mike Adams' thoughts on police officers murdering innocent people?

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:32,400
Oh, that's, um, oh, that's a hot take. Sorry for the pun. But putting aside any Twitter hot take,

53
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,200
he consistently tweets about BLM. But by BLM, he means the Bureau of Land Management. It's

54
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:44,640
strange that he never thought of trying to turn that into a hashtag. Until September 2015, when

55
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,440
the Black Lives Matter movement really picked up steam on Twitter. So what he's trying to do is

56
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,880
hijack the BLM hashtag to support white ranchers taking over a government building. Charming dude.

57
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,120
That braces us for the next section. R.J. Rummel at the University of Hawaii has extensively studied

58
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,120
what's called democide, the term describing death by government. According to his extensive

59
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:17,200
research through over 8,000 reports of government-caused deaths, Rummel estimates that there have

60
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:25,360
been 262 million victims of democide in the last century. That's six times as many people have

61
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,080
died from government-inflicted murder than have died in battle. In other words, if you think war

62
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:39,600
is bad, a monopoly of violence in the hands of government is far worse. All right, let's talk

63
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,160
about Rudolph Joseph Rummel. He came up with the term democide, which is used to describe when

64
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,400
government murders its own citizens. His stats on democide are widely circulated on Infowars and

65
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:58,080
other nonsense websites. And of course, these stats are, at best, contentious, as Rummel seems to take

66
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,360
the highest possible number of dead in every instance. As an example, the number of those

67
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,040
murdered by the government in China was originally considered to be 35 million in Rummel's first book

68
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,880
on the subject in 1991, but later he decided that the government was also responsible for the 38

69
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:22,640
million killed by famine. So he revised that figure of 35 million to 72 million in his 2005 book.

70
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,160
Maybe that's a fair assessment. I'm not really interested in being a malapologist here,

71
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:32,720
but I'm not convinced Rummel's stats can be considered authoritative if he's literally

72
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,400
doubling them when he finds a new degree of responsibility towards the government.

73
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,920
That said, it's difficult to engage with an academic who is written so prolifically on a

74
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,440
subject, especially when I have literally never heard of him outside of an Infowars website.

75
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,760
But as you might not be surprised, very little of what Rummel has to say, at least from my research,

76
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:58,320
has anything to do with gun control. The closest I could find was this quote.

77
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:24,000
As a family member. As one simply seeking happiness. Most of what one does now is subject

78
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,160
to government rules, regulations, and laws, and can be vetoed by judges or bureaucrats who are

79
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:38,320
backed up ultimately by the gun. That kind of makes him sound like he'd be a fellow traveler with

80
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,760
Mike Adams in his ilk, but it still doesn't go anywhere towards a stance on gun control.

81
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:50,640
If someone can point me towards Rummel's thoughts on gun control, I'd be highly curious. Rummel is

82
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:56,880
very much a fan of classical liberalism, kind of an ominous term nowadays, although he was talking

83
00:07:56,880 --> 00:08:02,640
about that well before it was cool with the centrists. But when Rummel talks about the

84
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:08,640
concentration of power, he's talking about the difference between democracies and communist

85
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,520
states. He very much comes across as someone who bought into the red scare, and it's strange how

86
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,600
he pays close attention to the communist governments failing their people like the famine

87
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,240
in Mao's China, but he seems less interested in acknowledging how many people have died from a

88
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,680
lack of healthcare or due to homelessness in democracies. Apparently he doesn't see this as

89
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:33,360
the responsibility of a government in a democracy. Adams tries very hard to tie gun control to the

90
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:39,520
stats presented by Rummel, but Rummel's work is pretty explicitly about democracy. And Adams

91
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,920
doesn't understand that democracy is not a product of an armed standoff, it's a divide that

92
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:50,160
can't be bridged in an eight minute documentary, or by an idiot. Halfway into this mini talk,

93
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:58,720
shit starts getting weird. Really weird. And because the right to self-defense is a divine right,

94
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,120
those who act to erode or nullify such a right are acting in violation of nature,

95
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,080
and in violation of our creator, those who support gun disarmament in...

96
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,720
First I want to hold on to this image, because this woman perfectly captures my response to the

97
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,520
idea of God having given people guns. As a non-believer, I'm not really sure what to say to this

98
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:32,160
except... Wow. As I mentioned earlier, this is actually part two of a documentary. That first

99
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,560
part of the documentary was titled The Divine Right of Self-Defense, and it's about how animals

100
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:44,560
defend themselves sometimes with projectiles like the spitting cobra. I want to play a very short

101
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,040
clip from this first documentary to show some of the sound effects Mike has added to this little

102
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,960
squirrel. The California ground squirrel is known to distract predators such as the rattlesnake and

103
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,080
gophersnake from locating their nest burrows by kicking sand into their eyes.

104
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,120
So intense. Anyway, I'm not going to really talk about that video much more. It basically says the

105
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:12,560
same things in this video while throwing in some shade towards police officers and plenty of other

106
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:18,400
examples of animals throwing things, projecting things at each other. The gun control is genocide

107
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:26,960
itself. It's really called gun control is genocide. I still can't get over that. The

108
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:32,320
doc dates itself by talking about the shooting at the movie theater in Aurora, Colorado in 2012

109
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,040
where gunfire killed 12 and wounded 58. I'd also like to note how strange it is to think that this

110
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,320
was only six years ago. This seems so far away, so far back in the past, and thinking about how

111
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,600
little has been done to change this. It makes much of Adams's commentary seem even stupider,

112
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:59,760
if that's possible. In banning concealed carry weapons in the hands of legal and lawful owners

113
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,400
in their city, Aurora officials created precisely the conditions that allowed a massacre to result

114
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:13,200
in a large body count. They forced the citizens to be defenseless, even while knowing their own

115
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:19,600
police forces could not provide protection to everyone. Aurora may, in fact, have been

116
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,040
selected by the shooter precisely because the city's gun restriction laws would practically

117
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,600
guarantee a disarmed crowd. Laws that ban concealed carry, it turns out, create what

118
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:40,000
might be called a hunting preserve for psychopaths. Another wow moment. I usually don't see such a

119
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,960
fluid stream of nonsense every day, but hey, the internet is a magical place like that.

120
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:51,360
First off, the idea that gun control would have no effect on the 2012 shooting is ridiculous.

121
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,760
The shooter, James Holmes, had visited three different psychiatrists, and one of them had

122
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,320
described him as having homicidal thoughts that didn't prevent Holmes from going out

123
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:05,600
and legally buying three guns in the weeks leading up to the shooting. In the interest of

124
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,080
balance, let me be a dirty centrist for a moment here because there's a caveat to that.

125
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:14,960
The psychiatrist who noted Holmes' tendency towards homicidal thoughts decided not to put

126
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,920
him on a mental health hold because she believed he was borderline and putting Holmes on hold would

127
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,280
have inflamed him. That might put the onus on her, but keep in mind that someone put on mental

128
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:31,440
health hold, which means 72 hours or less at a mental health facility, does not have to give up

129
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,880
any guns they may have purchased before being put on hold. And yeah, Holmes had purchased a gun

130
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,320
weeks prior to the psychiatrist noticing his homicidal thoughts. If police were given the power

131
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:47,200
to confiscate the weapons of a man with homicidal thoughts, and if mental health professionals could

132
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,400
be confident that putting someone on hold would ensure that they then wouldn't be able to go out

133
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,640
and easily kill some people afterwards, it might have helped things. But this is getting pretty

134
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,760
heavy, so I hope Mike can cheer us up with something.

135
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:40,160
Hold on, what the fuck is this? Did Mike Adams record this? Is this some kind of

136
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,920
first-person home invasion fantasy he's showing us? Oh god, Mike, these are home videos you shouldn't

137
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,680
be sharing with the world to make fun of. And oh god, Mike, do you have any more of these?

138
00:13:53,680 --> 00:14:01,280
Anyway, back to the prayer. I pray that we see through the propaganda and the deception

139
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,640
of citizen disarmament politics. He doesn't talk about this in the video, but I want to mention it

140
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:13,840
anyway. What is up with these pro-gun people and Nazis? Can they really not think of any other

141
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:20,080
examples of countries with gun control laws without mentioning the Nazis? Modern Germany

142
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,840
has gun control laws and seemed like it's more similar to the US than the Germany of the 1930s.

143
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:31,840
The gun laws of Germany in 1938 actually made owning firearms much easier for the average

144
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,720
German citizen. It restricted gun ownership of Jewish people, but plenty of Jewish people

145
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,440
actually had guns leading right up to the Holocaust. Turns out that owning guns wasn't

146
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,080
enough to stop state violence. But perhaps an engaged political class that stands in solidarity

147
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:54,400
with a persecuted minority might be a stronger deterrent. What does Mike Adams have to say about

148
00:14:54,400 --> 00:15:03,760
Black Lives Matter again? Oh yeah. I'll spare you the rest of the prayer when Mike Adams reads out

149
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,560
for us, especially since it's got a lot of images of dead bodies and even worse, more of Adams's

150
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,880
drivel. He never really addresses the fact that dozens of countries around the world have

151
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,840
thoughtful gun legislation and have not descended into some kind of Nazi hellscape.

152
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:27,040
Responding to Adams's use of rumble, his sighting of the Holmes case, and even discussing Nazi gun

153
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:32,560
laws introduces nuance and complexity that you don't see in his work. Even at only eight minutes,

154
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,320
the video still makes the same tired points repeatedly without adding anything new. I didn't

155
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:43,440
know you could get this repetitive with such little real estate. The simplistic trappings

156
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:47,840
of people like Adams are so effective, not just because they mislead, but also because they

157
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:53,360
nullify discussion, or at least make it very difficult for anyone with a rebuttal. Gun control

158
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:58,960
is genocide. When you put it that simply, anyone who wants to believe such an obvious lie will

159
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:05,040
swallow any garbage you present them, even things that are obviously not true. And while I hope this

160
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:11,760
response went some way into debunking his falsehoods, I suspect that Adams's fans don't really care.

161
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,280
He's telling them something they want to believe, and that's enough. In the future, I want to try

162
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:23,040
something different. I imagine we'll still be laughing at buffoons like Mike Adams, but reacting

163
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:28,400
and debunking only gets us so far. I want to understand where people like Mike Adams come from

164
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:34,000
and what drives them to spread garbage information. It's probably just money, isn't it?
