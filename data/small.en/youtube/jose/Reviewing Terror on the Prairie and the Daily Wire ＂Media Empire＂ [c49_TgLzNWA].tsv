0	5800	Beginning is a right-wing news outlet in 2015, and I use the term news very loosely here.
5800	9760	In 2021, The Daily Wire took its first steps into the world of entertainment, with the
9760	14480	release of Run, Hide, Fight, a movie that answers the question, what if Die Hard took
14480	16000	place at a school shooting?
16000	20760	I already went over that movie, including its very sordid history, in another video.
20760	24280	It was an important milestone for the outlet, as it moved them away from news coverage that
24280	29440	was heavily biased in favor of the right, towards entertainment that was, supposedly,
29440	32040	devoid of any kind of political agenda.
32040	35860	Since then, The Daily Wire has expanded its offerings to four movies on its streaming
35860	39640	service, including one starring Gina Carano called Terror on the Prairie.
39640	43560	This is the first movie Carano has appeared in since being fired off The Mandalorian by
43560	46080	Disney for her social media activity.
46080	49360	In addition to movies, The Daily Wire's streaming service, recently renamed Daily
49360	54520	Wire Plus, has been rapidly expanding its catalog, moving into kids' shows, documentaries,
54520	57280	sports podcasts, and daytime chat shows.
57280	61200	What we're seeing is a well-financed operation that is attempting to create a media landscape
61200	64880	that will, supposedly, compete with mainstream entertainment.
64880	67120	But I don't think that tells us the whole story.
67120	71000	I'm sure they'd love to be making more money than Disney, but they must know how incredibly
71000	72080	unlikely that is.
72080	75120	Instead, I think something else is being built here.
75120	79040	But before we dig into that, we first need to take a trip to the movies.
79040	82920	When I made that video about Run, Hide, Fight, I considered making reviews for all of the
82920	84240	Daily Wire movies.
84240	86760	And that was the plan until I watched them.
86760	91400	And I realized that, while that first movie had an absolutely bonkers premise, the rest
91400	94880	would be far less provocative and about just as boring.
94880	98680	Run, Hide, Fight was produced by Bonfire Legend, and of the three movies that followed the
98680	102720	school shooter one, two of them were produced by Bonfire Legend.
102720	106320	Formerly known as Sin Estate, they changed their name after one of their producers was
106320	109360	charged with allegedly sexually assaulting an underage girl.
109360	114080	They were a small production company operating out of Texas that would make low-budget movies,
114080	117620	and as we go through some of these movies they bay with the Daily Wire, you'll likely
117620	121640	not be shocked to find out you haven't heard of any of them, and we'll likely forget them
121640	122760	soon after.
122760	127000	Della Sonnier, who founded Bonfire Legend, said in an email to IndieWire,
127000	132240	Bonfire Legend reflects the spirit of my firebrand of moviemaking and my personal vendetta against
132240	136620	disingenuous morality amidst a deeply polarized body politic.
136620	141240	The first major effort between Bonfire Legend and the Daily Wire was shut in.
141240	144440	Starring Rainy Qualey, J. Carlwitz, and Vincent Gallo.
144440	148600	It's about a recovering addict, Jessica, who is trying to escape the influence of the
148600	152640	father of her children, Rob, and his creepy friend Sammy.
152640	157140	The movie has a surprisingly decent first two acts, offering some pretty good tension,
157140	161300	but ultimately falls apart in the third act with some weak action sequences and a slightly
161300	162960	awkward religious message.
162960	166680	Although as a thriller it didn't amount to anything too memorable, its production
166680	168520	does tell a more interesting story.
168520	172520	The script for shut in was originally bought by New Line Cinema, and at one point Jason
172520	174520	Bateman was even attached to direct.
174520	178880	But because of the COVID-19 pandemic, it languished in development limbo long enough for the deal
178880	179880	to fall through.
179880	184040	Della Sonnier, who had been shopping a script around, brought it to the Daily Wire.
184040	186680	The script was written by Melanie Toast.
186680	190240	This script was the first one she ever sold, and while it had been optioned by New Line
190240	192660	Cinema was facing a lot of changes.
192660	197060	When it was brought over to Daily Wire though, it was left untouched so that the movie produced
197060	199100	was as it was written on the page.
199100	202940	While that was nice of them to do, the fact that this was the first screenplay Toast had
202940	207420	ever sold makes me think it might have benefited from some input from others, especially when
207420	209140	you look at Final Product.
209140	212560	It had some good ideas that just didn't come together in the final release.
212560	215820	And while I personally wasn't overwhelmed by the movie, I do want to acknowledge that
215820	219600	the writer, Melanie Toast, had no intention of working with the Daily Wire.
219600	223860	In a tweet from Twitter user avishaiwineburger, he wrote about shut in,
223860	227340	having the rights to your script get tied up with these guys without your knowing what
227340	231260	they are, and then they sell it as an exclusive on an alt-right site.
231260	234380	Again, unless you asked for this, you didn't ask for this.
234380	235960	What a nightmare.
235960	238660	Toast replied with a simple, I didn't.
238660	243620	Happily for her, she now has a deal with Paramount working on a horror film titled Rabbit Rabbit
243620	244620	Rabbit.
244620	247860	I'm sure her work will keep getting better and I do wish her all the best.
247860	250940	Other people were involved with this production though, not so much.
250940	254900	In particular, Vincent Gallo, with shut in being his first appearance in a movie in
254900	256300	nine years.
256300	262140	Gallo first achieved some notoriety in 1998 with his movie Buffalo 66, making him something
262140	263760	of an indie darling.
263760	267500	After that though, he really struggled to find any sort of success, and over the years
267500	270060	has gotten into some trouble because of his behavior.
270060	272260	The Daily Wire characterized him saying,
272260	277020	"...his brash persona rubbed plenty of people the wrong way in La La Land.
277020	281660	Plus he's a loud and proud Republican unwilling to play by Hollywood's rules."
281660	285540	Let's just get a quick sample of that brash persona.
285540	289380	Gallo has made a distinct impression with his online merch store where he sells one-off
289380	295980	t-shirts for $666, with Sogans such as F*** Black Lives Matter, and one with a picture
295980	300020	of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau with a homophobic slur printed on it.
300020	303620	He also sells his sperm for $1 million.
303620	306080	Here's an excerpt from that section.
306080	309760	This is kind of a long excerpt, but it's pretty wild, so I feel as though I have to
309760	310760	read the whole thing.
310760	316480	Mr. Gallo maintains the right to refuse sale of his sperm to those of extremely dark complexions.
316480	322200	Though a fan of Franco Harris, Derek Jeter, Lenny Kravitz, and Lena Horne, Mr. Gallo does
322200	325320	not want to be part of that type of integration.
325320	330840	In fact, for the next 30 days, he is offering a $50,000 discount to any potential female
330840	334800	purchaser who can prove she has naturally blonde hair and blue eyes.
334800	339200	Anyone who can prove a direct family fling to any of the German soldiers of the mid-century
339200	341280	will also receive this discount.
341280	345360	Under the laws of the Jewish faith, a Jewish mother would qualify a baby to be deemed a
345360	347280	member of the Jewish religion.
347280	351760	This would be added incentive for Mr. Gallo to sell his sperm to a Jew mother, his reasoning
351760	355600	being that the slim chance that his child moved into the profession of motion picture
355600	360400	acting or become a musical performer, this connection to the Jewish faith would guarantee
360400	365240	his offspring a better chance at good reviews and maybe even a prize at the Sundance Film
365240	367840	Festival or an Oscar.
367840	371440	According to Sornier, this is some kind of satire.
371440	374800	I'm not entirely sure what it is, it's satirizing though.
374800	379840	In 2020, Gallo made a post on Instagram to show his support for Donald Trump and included
379840	381280	in the message he wrote,
381280	385640	Granting women the right to vote was a mistake, and that mistake is clearer now than ever
385640	386640	before.
386640	390840	If this is all meant as some sort of elaborate performance, it's a bit strange to think
390840	396080	that Gallo has basically burnt his career to the ground for the sake of these outbursts.
396080	400340	And in the case of The Daily Wire, the joke seems to be partially lost on them.
400340	405240	Or perhaps these reasons are simply emblematic of why no one wants to work with this guy,
405240	409960	aside from those who at least partially share some of these opinions.
409960	413060	Of course it should also be said if The Daily Wire is willing to work with a production
413060	417780	company that turned a blind eye to a sexual predator who was only stopped after allegedly
417780	422220	assaulting an underage girl, hiring a washed-up actor who is messed up views on gender and
422220	425000	race might not seem so extreme.
425000	428940	After Shut In, the next movie released by The Daily Wire was The Hyperions starring
428940	430380	Carrie Ellis.
430380	434260	This is similar to Run, Hide, Fight in that it was produced well before The Daily Wire
434260	439340	had any hand in the creative process, and they're only acting as the movie's distributor.
439340	443400	The movie took a long and complicated route going through multiple entities before ending
443400	447440	up on the streaming platform, but that story isn't so interesting.
447440	451100	So to get straight to the point, it had been languishing for three years before finally
451100	455260	getting released, and no one involved in this production had any idea it would end up on
455260	456540	The Daily Wire.
456540	460340	So we don't have to hate Carrie Ellis, and we can still celebrate him dunking on Ted
460340	461340	Cruz.
461340	465780	Sadly, the movie doesn't quite come together in what seemed, at first, like a thoughtful
465780	468980	attempt to address Disney's commodification of superheroes.
468980	473300	The style owes a lot to Wes Anderson, but without the charm or authenticity.
473300	476940	Ultimately, it's just not a very captivating movie.
476940	480420	At least there were no creepy sex pests working on this one though.
480420	484780	Which finally brings us to the latest movie from The Daily Wire, the Gina Carano-led Terror
484780	486300	on the Prairie.
486300	491280	Back in 2020, while working on The Mandalorian, Carano made a series of tweets comparing
491280	495780	being a conservative to being Jewish in Nazi Germany amidst pushing conspiracy theories
495780	499620	of voter fraud along with other talking points you would see in more conspiracy-minded
499620	501400	right-wing media outlets.
501400	506100	So when her behavior led Carano to being fired off The Mandalorian, she rebounded very quickly
506100	508420	signing a deal with The Daily Wire.
508420	512020	If you'd like to learn more about the situation, Council of Geeks has a good video going over
512020	516500	the controversy that details how Gina Carano wasn't fired because she expressed the wrong
516500	521860	ideology, but because her stirring up controversy made Disney think she might affect how profitable
521860	522860	their show would be.
522860	526980	Regardless of what the Daily Wire crew tell you, it's not being woke these corporations
526980	530940	care about, it's making money, and Gina Carano was fired because her behavior might
530940	533020	affect Disney's bottom line.
533020	536540	Although the first movie Carano was supposed to work on was titled White Knuckle, about
536540	540980	a woman who was targeted by a serial killer trucker, this was supposedly put on hold because
540980	542940	of COVID requirements for filming.
542940	547340	So instead, The Western, Terror on the Prairie, which was filmed in Montana, became the first
547340	549820	movie Carano would star in for The Daily Wire.
549820	553700	According to producer Dallas Sonnier, it was the looming federal vaccine mandates that
553700	555700	made him put White Knuckle on hold.
555700	560780	Why a federal mandate wouldn't also apply to Montana, which last I checked was still
560780	563180	in the United States, wasn't explained.
563180	566340	Let's actually go into some detail about the content of this movie.
566340	571060	Terror on the Prairie is about Hattie, the wife of a struggling farmer who has to defend
571060	575940	herself and her two children from four men while her husband is in town looking for work.
575940	578860	It's a siege of a small wooden cabin in the wilderness.
578940	583740	Eventually, the good characters end up happily and the bad unhappily because, as Oscar Wilde
583740	586860	once wrote, that is what fiction means.
586860	591740	Like Run, Hide, Fight, and Shut In, this movie resists interpretation as it exists largely
591740	594340	to service action sequences and tension.
594340	596740	But that doesn't mean it isn't saying anything.
596740	600460	Taking place shortly after the Civil War, we find out that Hattie's husband Jeb, played
600460	604980	by UFC fighter Donald Cerrone, was a former Confederate soldier who apparently turned
604980	606540	on his commanding officer.
606540	610100	When he and some of his fellow soldiers tried to murder their captain, they ended up killing
610100	615140	his daughter instead, leading the captain, played by Nick Cersei, to hunt them all down.
615140	618500	Which is how these four men ended up outside his Montana home.
618500	623340	The pride of Jeb and Hattie's son, of being an American, is contrasted with Jeb's shame
623340	628020	being a former Confederate, introduces an interesting tension in a post-Civil War America,
628020	630660	where the losing side has to reckon with their actions.
630660	634980	Whether it's shame for fighting on the wrong side or the humiliation for having lost, Jeb
634980	639020	still has to look his son in the eye knowing that he once fought against what his son holds
639020	640740	up as pure and good.
640740	644500	And Jeb's whole project to move to Montana further cements the westward expansion of
644500	645660	the United States.
645660	650500	So in addition to that shame or humiliation, Jeb is now in service to the state he once
650500	651500	fought against.
651500	657040	It's a thorough emasculation in a time and genre where a rugged masculinity would be
657040	658980	highly valued.
658980	662700	Had this movie been about Jeb, I think it might have been more interesting.
662700	667260	But instead we focus on Hattie, a character who doesn't seem to be quite as interesting
667260	671380	aside from the fact that she seems to come from a wealthy family and has given it up
671380	674200	to run off with Jeb to Montana.
674200	677580	She is the housewife who holds the family together while her husband is off trying to
677580	678940	make something of himself.
678940	682340	And it could have been an interesting look at the role women played in the 19th century
682340	684700	and the heavy burden of maintaining a household.
684700	688940	But by exploring that through a violent confrontation, it could struggle in survival in the west
688940	692620	with masculine signifiers, like fighting off bandits.
692620	697180	There is an irony here that I almost agree with the Daily Wire crew who generally seem
697180	702260	to get upset at female characters who star in action movies, especially those who adopt
702260	716460	male traits as some form of female empowerment.
716460	720460	The difference between us is that the action movie dynamic isn't interesting to me because
720460	725400	it traps displays of strength in a movie behind very old masculine-coated tropes.
725400	729300	Instead of letting female and male characters alike find other ways of demonstrating their
729300	730300	inner strength.
730300	734460	The only time we see Hattie making an impact where she isn't wielding a gun or in some
734460	738860	way fighting off bad guys is early on when we see her treat an indigenous character's
738860	741900	injuries, an experience that seems to rattle her.
741900	745940	Which is strange because in 50 minutes she'll be quite competently setting up barricades
745940	748580	and smashing windows to fight off the captain and his goons.
748580	753340	Still, her ability to treat someone medically is an interesting and thoughtful way of showing
753340	757740	how important and crucial a character like her is in this kind of environment.
757740	762620	And the fact that these are the only indigenous characters we see in the movie is also interesting.
762620	766380	This scene can be seen as a whitewashing of sort of the westward expansion of the United
766380	770940	States, doing a little bit to help the indigenous populations and then having their own wacky
770940	773860	adventures on land that was recently stolen.
773860	777380	Back to those action scenes that make up the bulk of the movie though, it's strange that
777380	779860	they're not scarier for Hattie.
779860	784220	Perhaps they seem scarier written down, but they don't really come across on camera.
784220	788020	That's probably because one of the biggest issues this movie has is that Gina Carano
788020	791060	just doesn't seem up to the task of leading the film.
791060	795260	I'm not deeply familiar with her acting history, so I don't know how this compares to her
795260	800100	previous work too much, but this performance on Terror on the Prairie is flat and lifeless.
800100	804180	She has the steely attitude of an action hero in the context of a western thriller.
804220	808540	As an example of how little she seems to be trying, consider the fact that Hattie is supposed
808540	811060	to be from Missouri and should have an accent.
825060	829500	It really seems that if Gina Carano was not going to do an accent for this movie, they
829500	832420	perhaps should have just dropped that line entirely.
832420	836860	Speaking of bad acting, the scenes between Carano and Cerrone are an absolute struggle
836860	837860	to watch.
853540	857580	Nick Cersei does an okay job as the captain, but otherwise the acting in this movie really
857580	858780	takes it down some.
859140	863260	It's bad enough to be distracting and undermined what I suspect is a movie about the role women
863260	867460	in the West had in holding households together, albeit awkwardly presented through the language
867460	868460	of violence.
868460	872860	It might be easy enough to ignore the clumsy messaging of this movie if the action were
872860	876780	interesting or exciting, but much of it is slow and clumsy.
876780	880580	Since it's the 19th century, we see a lot of people running around from not very far
880580	883700	distances as their guns struggle to hit anything.
883700	887300	The captain and his gang try a few schemes to get Hattie and her kids out of the house,
887300	891020	with varying degrees of failure, and we see our heroes eventually triumph while ignoring
891020	892020	their gunshot wounds.
892020	895380	In other words, basic action movie cliches.
895380	898660	It's a real shame we couldn't get a better female-led Western out of this thing, because
898660	902380	that is one of the few unique things Terror on the Prairie brings to the table.
902380	906860	Of the many, many Westerns produced in the last century, a minuscule number of them feature
906860	907860	female leads.
907860	912220	Ahead of this movie, I tried watching the few I could find, and it was a challenge just
912220	915060	to locate any female-led Westerns.
915060	919700	Some of the classics include Annie Get Your Gun and Calamity Jane, both musicals respectively
919700	924060	about Annie Oakley and Calamity Jane, who were both popular acts from the Buffalo Bill
924060	927340	traveling Western show from the early half of the 20th century.
927340	931820	There is also Annie Colder, starring Raquel Welch, about a woman who hunts down some outlaws
931820	932820	who wronged her.
932820	936980	In the 90s, there was The Quick and the Dead, starring Sharon Stone, about a female gunfighter,
936980	940820	and the most recent female-led Western I could find was Meeks Cut-Off, which, to be honest,
940820	944700	felt a little more like an ensemble piece than having a strong female lead.
944700	947780	Although it was certainly the best of the movies I watched.
947780	951740	Terror on the Prairie owes something to Annie Colder, as it has a similar premise, although
951740	956460	when it comes to Annie Colder, that movie is all over the place with its tone.
956460	961060	But through that madness, I still see Annie as a more believable character, as her journey
961060	966100	in this movie takes her from being a housewife to becoming a gunfighter, driven by her vendetta.
966100	970300	It's an old Western cliché, but it makes more sense than Terror on the Prayer's Hattie,
970300	974100	who somehow is able to fight off a siege at her farmhouse.
974100	976020	There's no development or growth.
976020	980700	Just the bad guy shows up, she fights them, and eventually, through a few twists of fate,
980700	981700	she wins.
981700	983580	It's not much of an arc.
983580	987760	Annie Get Your Gun and Calamity Jane both being musicals means they center on love stories,
987760	991620	but both tell fun stories about women who are underestimated by them and around them,
991620	994020	gradually building respect amongst their peers.
994020	997780	Calamity Jane in particular says a lot of interesting things about gender roles, with
997780	999740	people often treating Jane like a man.
999740	1004080	Her relationship with Wild Bill Hickok is built on a strong mutual respect, though romance
1004080	1008960	and feelings between the two can only be reciprocated when Bill finally sees Jane fit
1008960	1011120	into a more traditional gender presentation.
1011120	1015760	There's even a scene where a male actor is forced to pretend as though he were a woman.
1015760	1019960	In other words, this movie is making a lot of claims on how superficial gender roles
1019960	1023160	are, even in the very sharply defined world of the Western.
1023160	1027160	Terror on the Prairie could be implicitly making many of the same claims, but it's
1027160	1031760	so enraptured with its violence and intestinity that it never really pauses to explore these
1031760	1032760	questions.
1032760	1036480	It's read as an inversion in the characters of Hattie and Jeb, but everything else is
1036480	1040880	such a standard Western cliché that it struggles to say anything of substance, even when its
1040880	1044720	very premise is a direct challenge to gender roles in Western movies.
1044720	1047480	It makes the whole thing feel like a wasted opportunity.
1047480	1049920	So in short, I didn't like this movie very much.
1049920	1052200	I give it a 2.34 out of 12.
1052200	1055960	If you're wondering where Terror on the Prairie ranks amongst the female-led Westerns I've
1055960	1059760	seen, I'd place it roughly here, slightly below Handy Calder.
1059760	1063320	Maybe it seems like being the worst is a harsh criticism, but when there are so few
1063320	1067280	of these to begin with, it's actually not saying that much at all.
1067280	1068540	I just didn't like it.
1068540	1073000	The Daily Wire likes to characterize its movie and productions as being politically neutral.
1073000	1077240	That is, they want to make movies for everyone, not just a conservative audience, and they're
1077240	1079840	willing to work with anyone regardless of their politics.
1079840	1083200	And while I'm sure they would accept any celebrity who would help raise the profile
1083200	1087440	of their productions, they are quite obviously building a very conservative group of creative
1087440	1091360	people to work for them and are deliberately targeting a conservative audience.
1091360	1104320	Here's The Daily Wire's co-founder Jeremy Boring lying through his teeth.
1104320	1109320	As I showed you a few moments ago, Gina Carano's politics are not a mystery.
1109320	1111600	She is obviously and clearly conservative.
1111600	1116020	For Jeremy Boring to say this, in 2022, must be dishonesty.
1116020	1120540	She's not sure how far right she is, but she's clearly somewhere on the right.
1120540	1124260	Ahead of Terror on the Prairie's premiere, Dallas Sonnier, who was a producer on the
1124260	1127380	movie, posted on Instagram to thank his supporters who,
1127380	1131800	"...keep us motivated as we fight the commies for the right to live our lives freely and
1131800	1134580	watch our movies without garbage indoctrinations."
1134580	1139700	And when the crew took a photo in production, they posed with a giant red flag that read,
1139700	1141540	Let's Go, Brandon.
1141540	1145540	I wonder if that person regrets buying such a big memento for a dead meme mocking Joe
1145540	1146860	Biden.
1146860	1150940	Nick Cersei, who played the captain on Terror on the Prairie, is an outspoken conservative,
1150940	1153100	never letting a tired meme go to waste.
1153100	1157620	He joked on Twitter that while shooting Terror on the Prairie, he named his horse Brandon.
1157620	1160980	So he could say, Let's Go, Brandon, while riding.
1160980	1164460	For all the talk about keeping politics out of movies and how little they care about the
1164460	1168360	politics of the creative people they work with, the actual productions of these movies
1168360	1170540	have a distinctly right-wing flair to them.
1170540	1173780	It may just be that no one wants to work with The Daily Wire because they spread white-wing
1173780	1177140	propaganda, or it could also be that no one wants to work with them because their movies
1177140	1182460	are on a streaming service with a subscriber base less than 1% of Netflix or Disney+.
1182460	1186260	But still, they are getting talent to sign up with them, and there must be a reason.
1186260	1189940	And I think we got a pretty good indication why at the red carpet premiere for Terror
1189940	1191420	on the Prairie.
1191420	1195500	Here's Gina Carano being interviewed as to why she chose to work with The Daily Wire.
1195500	1197620	Why was it so important for you to work with The Daily Wire?
1197620	1200180	I'm sure you had tons of people knocking down your door.
1200180	1201180	Why'd you pick The Daily Wire?
1201180	1206860	Well, there was a big massive company that fired me.
1206860	1207860	I didn't hear about that.
1207860	1208860	It was a big deal.
1208860	1212860	They didn't want to work with me, which made the rest of the industry not want to work with
1212860	1213860	me.
1213860	1214860	And then all of a sudden, Daily Wire popped up and they were like, We want to work with
1214860	1215860	you.
1215860	1218020	And I was like, Wow, I want to work with you too.
1218020	1222460	And that's basically how it happened.
1222460	1225540	It's very cute that the interviewer tried to make it sound as though Gina Carano was
1225540	1229980	being highly sought after, and her response is that she actually didn't have many other
1229980	1230980	options.
1230980	1234900	Outside of her work with The Daily Wire, Carano is also set to appear in another movie, this
1234900	1239460	one titled My Son Hunter, which is about Hunter Biden.
1239460	1243100	In spite of the production photo of Hunter living a blessed life, this movie sounds like
1243100	1247020	it's capitalizing on the right wing obsession with Hunter Biden.
1247020	1250900	Gina Carano's options as an actress seem pretty limited.
1250900	1255020	Another familiar face at the red carpet premiere, and the only person you might have heard of
1255020	1264860	who is not currently on the Daily Wire's payroll, as far as I know, was Rob Schneider.
1264860	1268900	I got a bit of heat on Twitter saying Rob Schneider was the only celebrity not in the
1268900	1270820	movie to show up to this premiere.
1270820	1276140	And I want to once again sincerely apologize for using the term celebrity to describe Rob
1276140	1277140	Schneider.
1277140	1278140	I'll try to do better.
1278140	1282060	There are creative people who work on these movies who haven't had much mainstream success.
1282060	1285580	And considering how tough it is to make it in show business, it's understandable someone
1285580	1289060	taking whatever work might come their way, and hopefully some of them will move on to
1289060	1290580	bigger and better things.
1290580	1294580	But when it comes to these known quantities in Hollywood, it seems the only people who
1294580	1299060	want to do work with The Daily Wire are conservative celebrities who can't get a job anywhere
1299060	1302980	else or who aren't really quite on the A-list.
1302980	1306780	Using their shared ideology to get a quick payday for a series of movies that are forgotten
1306780	1308580	halfway through watching them.
1308580	1312740	After all the bravado of competing with Hollywood, so far The Daily Wire's attempt at making
1312740	1314660	movies has been a bit of a thud.
1314660	1319460	But feature films are only one part of a much larger enterprise that this right-wing outlet
1319460	1321420	is embarking on.
1321420	1324940	First off, not all of their movies are feature films.
1324940	1329580	While everyone is aware of Matt Walsh's abysmal documentary What is a Woman because
1329580	1333980	of the blanket advertising it saw here on YouTube back in June, The Daily Wire has also
1333980	1339700	made several other movies in that vein, including Choosing Death, The Legacy of Ro, China,
1339700	1342820	The Enemy Within, and Bouchie Unmasked.
1342820	1347500	Hilariously on the Daily Wire website, above this section it reads, The only agenda is
1347500	1348660	entertainment.
1348660	1353440	As if the upcoming movie from Candace Owens, called The Greatest Lie Ever Told, about George
1353440	1357980	Floyd and the rise of Black Lives Matter, is somehow going to be devoid of any agenda
1357980	1360300	or in any way be entertaining.
1360320	1365340	But The Daily Wire doesn't just stream bad movies and publish right-wing propaganda masquerade
1365340	1366340	in his news.
1366340	1370740	Of course, the major hosts of The Daily Wire, Ben Shapiro, Candace Owens, Matt Walsh, Andrew
1370740	1374180	Clavin, and Michael Knowles all have their own shows.
1374180	1377580	Although for some reason Candace Owens is the only one who doesn't get her full name
1377580	1378580	in the title.
1378580	1382540	They've also got several regular programs you've probably never heard of, such as
1382540	1386940	Ben Shapiro's Debunked, where he spends 15 minutes or less misreading science to explain
1386940	1390060	how climate change is no big deal or that God exists.
1390060	1394980	There's also Daily Wire Backstage, where Jeremy Boring assembles the bros to engage
1394980	1400160	in the classic manly pastimes of drinking scotch, smoking cigars, and crying about someone
1400160	1401940	being mean to them on Twitter.
1401940	1406420	And then there's Crane and Company, sports coverage that is supposedly not woke.
1406420	1411180	I've never quite figured out what this means, and looking at the descriptions of their programming,
1411180	1413860	it mostly seems like pretty standard stuff.
1413860	1416900	Like when they say the Toronto Maple Leafs are going to blow it in the playoffs, it's
1416900	1418700	what Leafs fans have known for decades.
1418700	1422580	The reason they might appeal to the right-wing Daily Wire audience is that part of their
1422580	1425060	sports coverage includes things like this.
1425060	1430020	For some context, this little tirade from Jake Crane comes after LeBron James criticized
1430020	1433940	the US government for not doing enough to free Brittany Greiner, who was arrested in
1433940	1439020	Russia in February of this year on drug charges, and she has been detained there for over five
1439020	1440020	months.
1440020	1444080	Now in most countries around the world, LeBron would have never had the chance to reach the
1444080	1445620	heights that he has.
1445620	1450180	But maybe it's time we the people start to push back a little bit on this diva, this
1450180	1456060	propaganda puppet for the CCP, this race hustler, and the same guy who told an innocent cop,
1456060	1457100	you're next.
1457100	1461140	Maybe we should trade LeBron for Brittany so he can start to form an appreciation for
1461140	1462880	the greatest country on earth.
1462880	1465660	This is what ESPN is apparently missing.
1465660	1469460	Long rant about how athletes don't love America enough.
1469460	1473780	Even if you want to step away from the screen, the Daily Wire is now publishing books, much
1473780	1477600	in the way their movies are courting conservatives who have talked themselves out of work.
1477600	1481020	Their book publishing wing is picking up books that were dropped by mainstream outlets.
1481020	1486140	For example, in April of 2021, Simon & Schuster decided not to publish a book by Sergeant
1486140	1490760	Jonathan Mattingly, who was one of the officers who fired shots during a narcotics raid that
1490760	1492140	killed Breonna Taylor.
1492140	1497020	It was published by the Daily Wire under the title, 12 Seconds in the Dark, a police officer's
1497020	1499580	first-hand account of the Breonna Taylor raid.
1499580	1502840	While they've published four books so far, none of them have cracked the New York Times
1502840	1504160	bestseller list.
1504160	1507920	I will tell the Daily Wire right now, though, that if they publish another Ben Shapiro novel,
1507920	1510560	I will make that book a bestseller.
1510560	1515320	On June 29, 2022, the Daily Wire made another announcement that they were expanding even
1515320	1516320	further.
1516320	1521360	To do this, they hosted Daily Wire Backstaged Live at the Ryman, which is a theater in Nashville,
1521360	1523640	this city where the Daily Wire currently operates out of.
1523640	1528880	The first hour and 50 minutes of this presentation is a long, drawn-out series of appearances
1528880	1533760	from many of the faces of the Daily Wire, featuring a lengthy version of their backstage
1533760	1537480	program live, this time including special guest Candace Owens.
1537480	1540600	You might have seen that clip of her online talking about how abortion wasn't happening
1540600	1542080	during the time of slavery.
1542080	1543520	Amy Schumer, same thing.
1543520	1547120	She came out and gave a statement about this is exactly what the slaveholders wanted.
1547120	1551640	And I was like, I would like a further explanation as to what you are talking about when you
1551640	1556480	make that statement, because there was there was no abortion happening when we had slaves.
1556480	1557920	What are you what are they saying?
1557920	1561280	Anyone with some knowledge of history knows that this simply isn't true.
1561280	1565040	Many forms of abortion have existed for thousands of years, and there were no laws regarding
1565040	1568080	abortion at all in the United States until 1821.
1568080	1572320	And it wasn't until the 1860s when abortion became illegal before quickening.
1572320	1576800	Quickening is when you can first feel kicking inside the womb, roughly 16 to 20 weeks into
1576800	1578000	a pregnancy.
1578000	1581480	The real purpose of this evening was to make several special announcements about the Daily
1581480	1586400	Wire's newest projects and to present the rebranding of their streaming service as Daily
1586400	1587400	Wire Plus.
1587400	1595680	I'm proud to announce that as of this very moment, we are launching Daily Wire Plus.
1595680	1600240	One of the announcements that was completely expected was their kids content initiative,
1600240	1604400	something that was already announced back in March when they pledged to invest $100
1604400	1607200	million into the project over three years.
1607200	1620740	The big reveal here was a trailer for their newest series, Chip Chillas.
1620740	1625920	This looks completely generic and uninteresting, but hey, I'm an adult, so it's not really
1625920	1626920	for me.
1626920	1630840	I do suspect it might get a little political in its content because the kids division is
1630840	1637180	being fronted by Eric Branscom and Ethan Nicole, who are respectively responsible for the Christian
1637180	1640460	themed series Veggie Tales and the Babylon Bee.
1640460	1644180	At the very least, it seems likely that there will be some religious messaging in these
1644180	1645180	shows.
1645180	1649620	Also, they already announced this show over two months before this event, except they
1649620	1652860	were calling it Chilla Time back then.
1652860	1655940	Suspiciously absent from this event was the other kids show they had already announced,
1655940	1657980	Doodle with Noodles.
1657980	1661240	Perhaps they've just run into some legal trouble with the YouTube channel Gourmet Quilter
1661240	1663540	for stealing the name of one of its segments.
1663540	1667740	The next announcement was The Daily Wire's continuing partnership with PragerU, where
1667740	1682860	all of PragerU's content would be made available on Daily Wire Plus.
1682860	1688460	This announcement seems even stranger, as PragerU's content is largely free already,
1688460	1692420	and they also announced they would be featuring PragerU content back in 2020.
1692420	1697140	But there is at least one new exclusive, something called the PragerU Masters Program
1697140	1702160	with Dennis Prager, videos in which, I imagine, Dennis Prager will offer pearls of wisdom,
1702160	1703900	such as why marital rape is okay.
1703900	1711660	If your husband is a good man, if you respect him, if he treats you beautifully, then don't
1711660	1715720	only allow your mood to determine whether you sleep with him.
1715720	1717200	That was the thesis of it.
1717200	1721700	Of course there are times when obviously that will determine, but not always.
1721700	1726780	Just as mood cannot determine, almost anything good that we do, I don't determine whether
1726780	1729180	I go to work based on my mood.
1729180	1733420	Comparing having sex with your spouse with going to work really reveals a lot.
1733420	1737340	I did take some time to read the article Prager wrote when he was referencing this ridiculous
1737340	1740940	statement though, and it's even more wild than that clip suggests.
1740940	1742580	Here's a deranged excerpt.
1742580	1747620	A husband knows that his wife loves him first and foremost by her willingness to give her
1747620	1749620	body to him.
1749620	1754580	This seems not only disrespectful to women, placing their primary value in a relationship
1754580	1760500	as their body, it also degrades men as deciding to be with someone primarily because of said
1760500	1761500	body.
1761500	1766060	And this article was actually a two parter where he just digs himself deeper and deeper,
1766060	1769660	and it reads like this despicable emotional blackmail.
1769660	1772700	But it does include one section that did make me laugh.
1772700	1776300	If most women wait until they are in the mood before making love with their husband, many
1776300	1779820	women will be waiting a month or more until they next have sex.
1779820	1784380	If a woman is only in the mood once a month or less, I'm going to take a wild guess
1784380	1789580	that she either has a very unusually low sex drive or perhaps more likely the man in her
1789580	1792220	life isn't appealing to her sexually.
1792220	1794940	It is very funny to me that Dennis Prager wrote this.
1794940	1798820	Going back to the Daily Wire thing, the big announcement that evening wasn't some forgettable
1798820	1803100	cartoon or Dennis Prager once again revealing himself to be a monster, it was the announcement
1803100	1816460	that the Daily Wire would be producing content with Jordan Peterson.
1816460	1821100	The crowd, as you can tell from that reaction, are very excited.
1821100	1823740	At this event, Jordan Peterson seemed a bit off.
1823740	1827460	His usual word salad wasn't full effect, but he struggled to lift his gaze from the
1827460	1831740	ground and seemed to be spending less time on building caveats to everything he was saying
1831740	1834980	and instead drifted into entirely different subjects.
1834980	1838340	Maybe it was an off night for him, though considering his recent health concerns, we
1838340	1841460	might be seeing some of the lasting impact of those challenges.
1841460	1844100	Either way, it was kind of sad to watch.
1844100	1848180	This announcement did mean we would be getting more slickly produced Jordan Peterson content,
1848180	1855300	including one of the best new memes of the year.
1855300	1859380	And that was about all the new content people can expect on Daily Wire Plus.
1859380	1864100	A kid show that was already announced, a new PragerU show, and a new Jordan Peterson
1864100	1865100	series.
1865100	1869820	We didn't get a trailer for their next upcoming movie or any information on their TV series
1869820	1871820	that they teased a year and a half ago.
1871820	1875960	The main reason for this event seems more like a push to generate as many subscribers
1875960	1893320	now so they can afford the content they want to make in the future.
1893320	1896880	The Daily Wire doesn't sound like the storming success they act like.
1896880	1901440	If they were a startup, it would be more understandable, but it's been a year and a half since they
1901440	1903200	announced their plans to go into movies.
1903200	1907580	And if their new initiatives are as compelling as Shut In or Terror on the Prairie, it hardly
1907580	1909120	seems like a wise investment.
1909120	1912080	It's really hard to know how well the Daily Wire is doing financially.
1912080	1917360	I found a few numbers detailing their performance, but since their records are all private, it's
1917360	1919120	tough to really piece together anything.
1919120	1921560	Here's what level I could find.
1921560	1925440	According to their website, when the Daily Wire was launched in 2015, it did so with
1925440	1929000	investment from Ferris Wilkes, a billionaire in the fracking industry.
1929440	1933440	It's a bit unclear if they still receive any funding from Wilkes, though reading their
1933440	1935800	former About section on their website, it reads,
1949800	1953680	This statement, of course, doesn't mean that the Daily Wire isn't still receiving money
1953680	1958480	from Ferris Wilkes separately or through one of the other entities controlled by the brothers.
1958480	1962080	And the Wilkes brothers have a long history of supporting right-wing causes in the past,
1962080	1967480	such as providing funding for PragerU and the 2016 presidential campaign for Ted Cruz.
1967480	1971200	This very defensive-sounding About section has since been replaced with something more
1971200	1972200	generic.
1972200	1977200	In 2022, speaking to Axios, co-founder of the Daily Wire, Jeremy Boring claimed that
1977200	1983200	they had a 12-month revenue of $100 million in January of 2022, up from $65 million in
1983200	1984720	the previous year.
1984720	1989160	According to Forbes in April of 2022, Boring claimed that the Daily Wire had a run rate
1989160	1995120	of $150 million a year, a run rate being a predictor of future performance for the company.
1995120	1998720	He also said they had 600,000 subscribers.
1998720	2005280	At the June live event, he revealed that the current subscriber count is now 890,000.
2005280	2011440	We have hit a huge milestone, 890,000 active subscribers.
2012000	2019200	A nearly 50% increase in subscribers in the space of two months is pretty stunning, though
2019200	2023340	aside from Matt Walsh's documentary, I'm not sure what changed for the streaming service
2023340	2026080	between April and June to lead to such a big jump.
2026080	2030440	In a press release, the newly revised run rate for the company was up to $200 million
2030440	2031440	a year.
2031440	2035880	It does seem strange that, with a subscriber increase of nearly 50%, the run rate has only
2035880	2037760	gone up by 25%.
2037760	2040880	But I have no idea how they're calculating their future growth, so maybe it all makes
2040880	2043520	sense if you can see their actual numbers.
2043520	2046600	Subscribers aren't the only source of revenue for the company, they also run a number of
2046600	2047600	ads in their content.
2047600	2051360	It's hard to estimate exactly what they're earning in these ad spots, but presumably
2051360	2054040	it must be a sizable portion of their revenue.
2054040	2058360	So of the few metrics we have, the Daily Wire seems to be making decent money.
2058360	2062360	Whether or not they're covering their expenses, which includes producing several movies and
2062360	2067720	documentaries, web shows, kids programming and their book publishing, selling razors,
2067720	2071440	and of course, paying their 200 employees, it's not entirely clear that they can afford
2071440	2073280	all of these enterprises.
2073280	2076680	Boring was adamant about not taking the company public, though.
2076680	2083240	Where does this $100 million come from?
2083240	2087440	I'm wondering myself.
2087440	2088480	I can tell you this.
2088480	2093080	The Daily Wire has been approached by six different entities in the last three months
2093080	2096760	about doing a public offering by way of a SPAC.
2096760	2100520	And we have said no.
2100520	2104160	Not being publicly traded also means that their financial statements will not be readable
2104160	2105160	by the public.
2105160	2109040	So while Boring did tease that the company may go public in the future, it remaining
2109040	2113120	private lets them operate without us having any real insight to how they're doing financially,
2113120	2116760	aside from what they say in their marketing, which obviously is going to put them in their
2116760	2118360	best light possible.
2118360	2121880	Boring also had fun sharing less helpful statistics.
2121880	2127320	And for 18 months over the last two years, we were the number one publisher in the world,
2127320	2132000	the most engaged publisher in not the most engaged conservative publisher, not the most
2132000	2137360	engaged news publisher, the most engaged publisher of any kind in the world on the number one
2137360	2141360	platform, Facebook.
2141360	2143480	This is a very convoluted stat.
2143480	2147440	For one, those 18 months are not consecutive if they were across two years.
2147440	2151920	And while social media traction is important, it's strange to mention Facebook and only
2151920	2156160	Facebook and engagement doesn't mean getting the most views on the platform, but rather
2156160	2158760	getting the most reaction from viewers.
2158760	2162320	That is getting people to click one of those little reaction buttons on the page.
2162320	2166640	Unsurprisingly, political content designed to enrage or rile people up gets a lot of
2166640	2167640	clicks.
2167640	2172040	In October of 2020, Facebook pushed back against the idea that engagement reflects overall
2172040	2176440	popularity with an article that shows how political content is more likely to get engagement
2176440	2181200	but tends to rank much lower in overall reach compared to content from more neutral sources
2181200	2183480	such as videos with cute animals.
2183480	2188200	The data being from 2020 may not be entirely applicable to the present, but it does underscore
2188200	2193200	how engagement is a selective stat that doesn't necessarily reflect overall popularity on
2193200	2194400	the platform.
2194400	2197880	Of course, that doesn't mean that it's a meaningless stat or that the Daily Wire is
2197880	2198880	doing poorly.
2198880	2202000	High engagement is obviously a very good thing for them.
2202000	2205760	Much like their financial numbers, we should just take this stat with a grain of salt as
2205760	2207660	it's obviously part of their marketing.
2207660	2212040	But there is an interesting strategy being deployed by the Daily Wire regarding its social
2212040	2214840	media success, particularly on Facebook.
2214840	2219320	According to research from The Markup, a non-partisan, non-profit data research organization, the
2219320	2224160	Daily Wire strategy isn't really to target all Americans, but instead be the destination
2224160	2225480	for conservatives.
2225480	2228140	And their online marketing reveals their partisan approach.
2228140	2231960	This is in stark contrast to other media outlets which cast a wider net.
2231960	2236800	The Markup article includes comments from Francesca Tripodi, an assistant professor
2236800	2240800	at UNC School of Information and Library Sciences at Chapel Hill.
2240800	2241800	She said,
2241800	2245400	As you're looking at this dataset, to me it shows that mainstream media outlets like
2245400	2249400	the New York Times are still approaching the internet as a collective space in which you
2249400	2254920	could potentially learn about anything, from research or science to family and relationships.
2254920	2258800	But Daily Wire, if you're saying, we only want to target people who are interested in
2258800	2263600	conservatism in America, that creates this bifurcated or dual internet, and that allows
2263600	2266200	for information to circulate unchecked.
2266200	2270080	This means the Daily Wire's success isn't necessarily coming from the mainstream, but
2270080	2274920	rather it's targeting a specific audience, and that audience is incredibly receptive
2274920	2275920	to their message.
2275920	2280080	The Daily Wire is behaving less like a traditional media outlet, attempting to spread news to
2280080	2284520	everyone and more like a corporation targeting potential customers looking for a very specific
2284520	2285520	product.
2285520	2289160	An example used in the article is that they're acting like a food brand serving ads to people
2289160	2290840	who like potato chips.
2290840	2295080	The Markup also found that the Daily Wire uses a lot of tracking tools.
2295080	2301240	Using Blacklight, a website privacy inspector, on August 4th, 2021, they found 41 ad trackers
2301240	2305320	and 117 third party cookies on the Daily Wire's homepage.
2305320	2310120	In comparison, looking at the 100,000 most popular websites in September of 2020, on
2310120	2314920	average they used 7 ad trackers and 3 third party cookies.
2314920	2318720	In addition to making use of tracking tools and targeting specific communities, the Daily
2318720	2322800	Wire also invests a lot of money in sponsored posts promoting its content.
2322800	2326720	Earlier this year, Vice published an article detailing how the Daily Wire spent between
2326720	2333180	$35,000 and $47,000 on Facebook and Instagram ads promoting articles about the lawsuit between
2333180	2334860	Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.
2334860	2339280	One article in particular about the supposed character assassination of Johnny Depp had
2339280	2344560	somewhere between $20,000 and $25,000 alone promoting it by the Daily Wire.
2344560	2349000	Unsurprisingly, these articles included misinformation about the trial with the major article I
2349000	2353200	just mentioned having to include an embarrassing editor's note correcting the fact that Johnny
2353200	2357200	Depp did not disprove 12 of the 14 allegations against him.
2357200	2360720	But I want to highlight just how much money is being spent by the Daily Wire to promote
2360720	2362560	their coverage of a single news story.
2362560	2366120	While we don't have concrete numbers on how much the Daily Wire spent on social media
2366120	2370920	ads in general, we can be sure their engagement is being driven by more than organic interest
2370920	2372680	in their content.
2372680	2377000	While this may paint the picture that the Daily Wire is particularly good at gaming
2377000	2381920	Facebook systems to build an audience further content, we also need to take into consideration
2381920	2386000	its history with the platform and how it built such a following on Facebook.
2386000	2392760	A 2019 article on popular information highlighted 14 large Facebook pages that seemingly operated
2392760	2396080	as independent outfits, sharing right-wing news stories.
2396080	2400600	These 14 pages were fairly popular with a combined total of 8 million fans, and they
2400600	2406560	all had generic names such as conservative news or don't mess with America.
2406560	2411640	Only these supposedly independent outlets exclusively reposted Daily Wire articles,
2411640	2416360	with many of them making identical posts down to the same minute, meaning these 14 pages
2416360	2421720	all, coincidentally, only thought the Daily Wire posted anything worth sharing and all
2421720	2424840	shared new articles the second they went live.
2424840	2429360	Or what was more likely here is that these supposedly independent pages were all being
2429360	2435160	secretly operated by the Daily Wire, which would be in violation of Facebook's rules.
2435160	2439160	When this 2019 article was published, all of these pages would eventually update their
2439160	2442960	about sections to include the line, proudly managed by the Daily Wire.
2442960	2447400	Although for some reason don't mess with America's page only reads, proudly managed
2447400	2448620	be.
2448620	2452360	This newfound pride over their management only became clear after Facebook updated its
2452360	2456580	transparency standards and only after this strategy was exposed.
2456580	2461100	The popular information article also highlights how, by not disclosing this relationship,
2461100	2464240	the Daily Wire was in violation of Facebook's terms of service.
2464240	2468820	In the past, similar behavior from other groups had led to those pages being banned, but the
2468820	2472060	Daily Wire seems to have been given a pass.
2472060	2475600	Also in this same article, they spoke to a former Facebook employee who identified a
2475600	2481000	bias towards right-wing media by Joel Kaplan, Facebook's head of global public policy
2481000	2484320	and a former member of the George W. Bush administration.
2484320	2486080	The former employee is quoted saying,
2486080	2490720	"...anytime there is an issue with Breitbart or Daily Caller, Joel made the decision, and
2490720	2492880	he always acted to protect them."
2492880	2497960	There was also that well-documented 2019 dinner between Ben Shapiro and Mark Zuckerberg that
2497960	2502040	was held to supposedly talk about free speech on the platform.
2502040	2505720	It also puts into perspective that Facebook story I mentioned a bit earlier about the
2505720	2507560	limitations of engagement.
2507560	2511480	I do still think it has valid information highlighting that engagement isn't the end
2511480	2516720	of the story and it isn't the best stat to monitor success on Facebook, but it could
2516720	2520820	also be that Facebook is instead trying a way to spin the news that their algorithm
2520820	2523360	is pushing right-wing media so hard.
2523360	2528820	Far from being silenced by big tech, allying the Daily Wire love saying it by themselves,
2528820	2533980	when it comes to the Facebook platform specifically, the Daily Wire seems to be given more space
2533980	2538140	to break the rules and they have access to the biggest guy in the company.
2538140	2542780	Even though these days, those 14 aforementioned Facebook pages aren't the driving force
2542780	2547340	and don't get quite as much engagement as, say, Ben Shapiro sharing a story would, I
2547340	2549880	think it's important to remember their foundational work.
2549880	2554340	It was crucial in building up the Daily Wire's audience in its earliest years and it reveals
2554340	2558980	that the secret to their growth isn't genuine organic interest in their content, but rather
2558980	2562980	the Daily Wire exploiting their relationship with Facebook to cheat the system in ways
2562980	2564980	other publishers couldn't.
2564980	2568920	Forgettable movies, the gnashing of conservative teeth, and an aggressive social media campaign
2568920	2570900	that courts a right-wing audience.
2570900	2572800	What does any of this mean?
2572800	2576220	What the Daily Wire is attempting to do is create an all-encompassing bubble for right-wing
2576220	2577220	media.
2577220	2581860	They may talk a big game about taking on Disney or Netflix and when it comes to profits, maybe
2581860	2583380	that really is the dream.
2583380	2586940	But looking at their current strategy, it's less built on appealing to the mainstream
2586940	2592260	in some kind of bid to replace them and instead appealing directly to conservative audiences.
2592260	2596100	Looking back on its movies, content they allege is politically neutral, they market
2596100	2600900	this content as rejecting the mainstream supposedly woke voices of Disney.
2600900	2604780	They say quite explicitly that these movies are for people who feel as though Hollywood
2604780	2605780	hates them.
2605780	2609620	They'll still let you watch their movies, of course, their TV shows, their news, their
2609620	2613540	sports, but you'll have to do it knowing that everyone who made that content, at least
2613540	2615860	everyone at the top, hates you.
2615860	2619860	You have to watch it knowing that every dollar you spend on theater tickets, on cable bills,
2619860	2623500	on streaming subscriptions is going to the people that hate you, funding their hatred
2623500	2624500	of you.
2624500	2627860	Not only that, but they're going to spend every day on Twitter, every spare moment at
2627860	2633060	every award show, and just about every second of every show that they make reminding you
2633060	2635220	of the fact that they hate you.
2635220	2640300	Their concept of the average American happens to be the American who agrees with them.
2640300	2642360	In other words, conservatives.
2642360	2646580	By offering a program that includes sports, kid's shows, political commentary, documentaries
2646580	2650860	and TikTok-style videos, they are trying to appeal to as many people as possible, who
2650860	2652860	adhere to their conservative values.
2652860	2656060	And once they have these people, I suspect the goal is to keep them trapped in their
2656060	2659740	media bubble, and to own the conservative media niche.
2659740	2662960	This isn't a new strategy, and we can see something similar when it comes to the world
2662960	2664700	of Christian media.
2664700	2675460	The Left Behind books, which tell the story about how the rapture will affect the world,
2675460	2677940	have sold over 65 million copies.
2677940	2681380	Unless you're a fan of the cinematic stylings of Kirk Cameron or Nicolas Cage, there's
2681380	2684180	a pretty good chance you haven't heard of them, but they've sold more copies than
2684180	2687420	the Magic School Bus, the Hardy Boys, and Tarzan.
2687420	2691500	The Christian music scene, which, while often a punchline in the mainstream, has been chugging
2691500	2695500	along for decades, making stars and earning millions of dollars.
2695500	2699220	And if you watch certain videos here on YouTube, you might even be familiar with the Christian
2699220	2703900	movie scene, which includes the classics God's Not Dead, Christmas with a capital C, and
2703900	2705340	Heaven is for Real.
2705340	2709300	And naturally, Christian movies have their own streaming service, Pure Flix.
2709300	2712980	The Christian media scene has existed for decades, and it's been making huge amounts
2712980	2714340	of money the whole time.
2714340	2718100	Part of what makes it work is that it has a faithful audience that is, sometimes, ready
2718100	2721460	to spend big money for media that reaffirms their worldview.
2721460	2723780	Although in the world of Christian media, there are many different stakeholders and
2723780	2726420	platforms offering their own services.
2726420	2730700	Products and industries with their own ecosystems have always existed, of course, usually occupying
2730700	2731700	niches.
2731700	2734900	If you're a fan of anime, you get your own little section on Netflix, or you can get
2734900	2736660	streaming services directly for that.
2736660	2739940	And of course, there's merch, movie screens, and other fun bonuses that come with being
2739940	2740940	into it.
2740940	2744680	What separates Christian media from niche interests like these, though, is that it builds
2744680	2749740	this strange parallel universe by explicitly rejecting the mainstream, unless the mainstream
2749740	2753020	accepts them, to create its own bubble of content.
2753020	2757140	A random person can probably name an anime, but unless someone is in that Christian media
2757140	2761380	bubble, whether they're enjoying it as an insider or mocking it as an outsider, you'd
2761380	2765340	be hard-pressed to find many people who have even heard of the biggest hits in that space.
2765340	2768780	If you took a random sample of people, I think the odds are pretty good that more of them
2768780	2772340	would recognize Dragon Ball than they would Gods Not Dead.
2772340	2775100	Also for the record, I'm pretty sure Goku could beat up Kevin Sorbo.
2775100	2778780	The Daily Wire is taking this strategy of creating an insular bubble of content and
2778780	2783020	going a step further, creating a parallel landscape for conservative media, but trying
2783020	2787180	to do it all themselves in what might become one giant company.
2787180	2791780	They want to be the one-stop-shop for anything and everything in the conservative media space,
2791780	2795180	and to capture that audience that supposedly feels threatened by the mainstream.
2795180	2798660	And if they aren't feeling threatened, then the Daily Wire is happy to publish all the
2798660	2801060	propaganda they need to create that fear.
2801060	2804300	I'm not enough of a media expert to make any predictions on whether or not they'll
2804300	2805300	be succeeding.
2805300	2809140	It is pretty plain that they are spending a lot of money, not just on production, but
2809140	2811100	on marketing for all of their content.
2811100	2814580	One of the things they touted during their media presentation, and in many other instances
2814580	2818620	when they speak to the public, is their platform's ability to market content.
2818620	2822620	Part of that seems to be the unwavering devotion their core audience seems to have, willing
2822620	2826740	to buy razors or children's books if the Daily Wire tells them to.
2826740	2831100	How else can one explain them selling these ridiculous truth bombs on their website for
2831100	2832100	$174?
2832100	2836700	Though it does remain to be seen just how large this core audience is, and how much
2836700	2839340	more the Daily Wire can expand it.
2839340	2843220	The success of the Daily Wire's media venture rests on the idea that they can continue to
2843220	2846260	expand their audience and recoup all these expenses.
2846260	2850620	Jeremy Boring repeatedly emphasized the need for the Daily Wire to keep growing.
2850620	2854220	Some of that, I'm sure, is motivated by the profit they want to make, but it's probably
2854220	2858300	a necessity to pay for all these projects that are likely in need for funding.
2858300	2862220	The fate of this media venture may reflect, in dollars and cents, the strength of the
2862220	2864140	conservative movement in America.
2864140	2867700	If it truly does have the popular support it would require to fund all of this, then
2867700	2873200	it may very well be that the niche of American conservatives is enough to build a media empire.
2873200	2877320	But if it fails, it would instead reflect how the American public isn't as conservative
2877320	2879640	as the Daily Wire imagined them to be.
2879640	2883680	Or it might fail and prove that the Daily Wire was never any good at producing media
2883680	2886600	outside of hate-fueled clickbait.
2886600	2890880	This video is a little different from my previous ones as it kind of feels like two videos squished
2890880	2895240	together, but I just felt as though the two subjects complimented each other really well
2895240	2899680	and when talking about the Daily Wire, I wanted to go a bit deeper than just looking at a
2899680	2903000	movie or only looking at their business ventures.
2903040	2906400	So I hope this fits together well enough and that you enjoyed it.
2906400	2910360	And if you really enjoyed it, do consider becoming a patron or a member for the channel.
2910360	2913200	You can see the names of some of those people on the screen right now and don't they look
2913200	2914200	lovely?
2914200	2918520	They also get early access to videos along with some other fun bonuses that I surprise
2918520	2920160	them with every now and again.
2920160	2924320	If you would like to support this channel in a non-monetary fashion, you can like, comment,
2924320	2928040	subscribe, hit the bell for notifications, and also consider sharing it on social media
2928040	2929040	because that helps out too.
2929040	2932800	If you'd like to leave a comment and don't know what to say, how about pitching your
2932800	2938440	idea for a movie for the Daily Wire and maybe they'll read it into it.
2938440	2941600	Thank you all so much for watching.
