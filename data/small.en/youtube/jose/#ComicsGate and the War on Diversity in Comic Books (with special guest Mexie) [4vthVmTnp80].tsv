0	5720	Have you ever read a comic where the hero fought an evil corporation or tyrannical government?
5720	13040	Some might call storylines like these or images like these ones a subtle political statement.
13040	18360	But others, however, can't or choose not to see any politics here.
18360	22680	These are just colorful images of adventures unconnected to the world of politics.
22680	27240	And if they start to see politics, that must be the product of some kind of sinister agenda
27240	29880	to push the creator's beliefs onto people.
29880	36160	The only politics in their mind that should be in comics are bland, centrist, mainstream
36160	37160	opinions.
37160	41800	Nothing that could be considered objectionable or outside the norm.
41800	44680	Or at least, the norm is they see it.
44680	50140	This crowd of complainers, which spawned movements such as Game or Gate, typically parade the
50140	53440	mantra of having politics shove down their throat.
53440	58880	And politics, in their mind, often includes diverse characters and the hiring of diverse
58880	62640	characters, all to push a sinister progressive agenda.
62640	67880	If the complaint is that the stories are bad, why not complain about the writing instead
67880	69560	of the diversity?
69560	74240	Maybe the problem really is because some people just don't like seeing diversity in their
74240	80840	comics.
80840	86240	Comics can be many things, from edgy underground political commentary to touching melodrama
86240	89120	about the trials of growing up in a man's world.
89120	92840	For the purposes of this video, though, we're going to be looking exclusively at the genre
92840	96720	synonymous with comic books, and that's superheroes.
96720	100680	That all started with Action Comics number one, the first appearance of Superman.
100680	104920	In the coming decades, he would be followed by Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America,
104920	108720	The Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and some other characters you may have heard
108720	109720	of.
109720	112720	And probably way, way more you haven't.
112720	115880	You may have noticed one thing most of these characters have in common.
115880	119960	The majority of them are men, and most of them are white.
119960	124840	From the 1930s to the 1960s, the US was a very white place, and superhero comics were
124840	127160	typically read by young boys.
127160	131600	Publishers knew that these young boys enjoyed reading characters that looked like them.
131600	134520	Publishers also liked money, so that's who they sold their books to.
134520	140000	So this wasn't exactly a nefarious plot, but rather the blind prejudice of capitalism
140000	142800	that gave us all these white guy characters.
142800	147880	And the few times minorities were included, we'd get, ugh, things like this.
147880	152880	While many characters were forgotten, thankfully, in some cases, a few persisted.
152880	157400	As the US became more diverse, publishers sought ways to pursue that expanding demographic
157400	161640	of non-white guys, and maybe the even more elusive demographic of women.
161640	166320	To that end, an increasingly broad range of diverse characters were and are still being
166320	167320	created.
167320	171200	Of course, the earliest attempts were not always the most thoughtful.
171200	176240	Luke Cage was the product of the Blaxploitation craze of the 70s, and Shang-Chi, a product
176240	178480	of the Kung Fu movie craze.
178480	183200	These characters are obviously cheap stereotypes, although they have grown over the years to
183200	185700	be a bit more interesting and complex.
185700	190240	In recent years, the two biggest superhero comic publishers, Marvel and DC Comics, have
190240	195160	tried to escape racial stereotypes and present as wide a lineup of diverse characters as
195160	196160	they possibly could.
196680	199480	I'm going to talk briefly about Black Panther.
199480	204360	I'm assuming you've probably seen it because I think everyone saw it.
204360	208820	The opening scene of Black Panther tells you a lot about who this movie is intended for.
208820	212440	It features Black children taking a break from their game of basketball to look up at
212440	214200	something exciting happening.
214200	218560	It's an image you could have seen in theaters around the world when Black Panther was screening.
218560	223320	To me, it seemed like a very clear message that this is who the movie was for.
223320	227280	Not just because it had a black superhero, like Blade or Spawn.
227280	232000	This was a film with a writer, director, and cast that was predominantly black.
232000	237560	Set in Africa, and ensconced in African culture, it meant a lot to people.
237560	240360	I remember seeing this video after Black Panther came out.
248360	251960	I've never left a movie and wanted to start a dance party, but that's how much it means
251960	256000	to people to have a character who finally speaks to their experiences and culture.
256000	260040	It's a chance to feel as though their stories are finally being told.
260040	264400	Stories that weren't being told in superhero movies about white Americans.
264400	267160	This is why representation matters.
267160	270840	Comics have been reaching out to audiences in the same spirit, with new characters such
270840	276680	as the New Muslim Miss Marvel, a half-black half-Hispanic Spider-Man, and a black Captain
276680	277680	America.
277680	281160	And if you're wondering why we're getting so many variations on the same characters,
281160	283840	that's kind of been a thing in comics for decades.
283840	289880	We've had four flashes, five robins, and more green lanterns than I can count.
289880	294120	For what successes there have been, there have been far more failures.
294120	299480	A sad fact of comics is that most people don't like new characters as much as the old ones.
299480	304000	Things typically revert back to when the character was most popular, which is generally what
304000	305720	they were like in their earliest stories.
305720	308600	It's why Spider-Man is often depicted as a teenager.
308600	312300	These are the tropes and eras that made them successful, and the ones that are most familiar
312300	316520	and comfortable to readers, going back to a time when characters were typically white
316520	323000	men.
323000	326920	Criticism from the left about the state of comics isn't particularly new.
326920	331800	Gail Simone, the eventual writer of comics including Secret Six and Birds of Prey, teamed
331800	336240	with some of her feminist friends to create the website Women in Refrigerators back in
336240	337880	1999.
337880	342880	This references a rather infamous story where Green Lantern's girlfriend was murdered and
342880	344880	stuffed into a refrigerator.
344880	349760	In addition to that story, it chronicled the many ways in which female characters had been
349760	354380	metaphorically stuffed into fridges to create some pathos for a male character.
354380	360240	Most controversy that popped up tended to be storms and teacups, a lot of intense discussion
360240	363960	and debate, though usually in a few months it would kind of go away.
363960	369200	Like this one of a statue of Mary Jane where she's washing Spider-Man's costume, people
369200	374240	thought that creating a statue where Spider-Man's girlfriend is washing his clothes in a thong
374240	377880	and low-cut shirt might not be the most positive image for women.
377880	383040	Then this whole thing called gamergate started, and suddenly people were very upset about
383040	390360	depictions of women and minorities in video games, and this rhetoric was sadly quite transferable
390360	392080	to the comics community.
392080	396640	Then there was this variant cover of the first issue of Spider-Woman by Italian artist
396640	400240	Milo Menara, revealed in August of 2014.
400240	405160	The uproar around this was initially called Spider-Buttgate, it was the controversy of
405160	408720	the moment when the term comicsgate came to life.
408720	414200	As best as I can tell, the term comicsgate was originally used ironically, but very quickly
414200	418560	it fell into favor with a group not too dissimilar from the gamergate crowd.
418560	422520	While the movement was still some time from really taking off, it's here that the term
422520	434520	first took root in the minds of a few people.
434520	438840	The first high-profile harassment case often attributed to the comicsgate crowd targeted
438840	440400	Chelsea Kane.
440400	444120	Before entering comics, Kane distinguished herself writing a series of successful thriller
444120	447840	novels with the first three all being New York Times bestsellers.
447840	452700	In 2016 she was hired by Marvel to work on a new Mockingbird ongoing series, though critically
452700	458080	well received, its sales were less than stellar, and it was cancelled with issue number eight.
458080	461880	For that final issue though, Kane had the artist produce a cover where Mockingbird was
461880	466320	wearing a t-shirt that read, ask me about my feminist agenda.
466320	471520	The backlash to this cover was immediate, it got the full anti-SJW treatment, including
471520	475680	a shout out in a Carl Benjamin video where he misreads the title.
475680	485520	This is actually the cover of a Marvel magazine, Civil War II, Civil War II, Civil War II.
485520	489720	Although the harassment surrounding Kane's tenure on Mockingbird eventually drove her
489720	495140	away from social media entirely, reflecting back on it in 2018 she also highlights the
495140	498800	positive experiences of fans coming to support her through that time.
498800	503280	It even translated to a sales spike for the first volume of the Mockingbird ongoing series
503280	507880	and two Eisner nominations for the title, including one for Kane as writer of the year.
507880	511640	Kane didn't describe the Twitter mob after the eighth issue as driving her off Twitter
511640	516680	though, rather it was the everyday harassment that really got to her and she experienced
516680	518360	it constantly.
518360	524360	The intense outroer after that number eight issue was just the most public symptom taken
524360	525360	from her blog.
525360	531040	I quit Twitter, I deactivated my account Thursday after receiving several misogynist and or
531040	533520	jerky comments the night before.
533520	534520	Several.
534520	535520	Not dozens.
535520	537000	Not a deluge.
537000	538000	One is too many.
538000	542420	I was tired of wasting energy dealing with the constant low-level misogyny and meanness
542420	545400	that pollutes a certain kind of comic fandom.
545400	548400	I posted some comments reflecting my frustration.
548400	554400	The next morning, when I logged on to deactivate, I saw that I had lost approximately 1,500
554400	555400	followers overnight.
555400	558320	I also saw my notifications were filling up with new followers.
558320	560520	I saw that comments were flooding my feed.
560520	562360	I had no idea what was happening.
562360	566520	I had never seen that kind of activity on my account, but I figured it wasn't good.
566520	568080	I went through the deactivation.
568080	573080	I assumed I had been trolled in some kind of organized sense, but I didn't know.
573080	574080	Still don't.
574080	575720	Frankly, I didn't care.
575720	576720	It was moot.
576720	579160	I was done.
579160	584160	Kane didn't leave comics, though she would later say she felt as if comics had left her.
584160	588080	She's currently working on a series called Man-Eaters for Image Comics.
588080	591820	It's about girls turning into wildcats when they go through their period.
591820	594840	She has yet to write again for Marvel Comics.
594840	598800	Kane was the first high-profile target of a mob that would target women, typically working
598800	603360	for Marvel Comics, which is perceived as being controlled by the SJWs.
603360	608560	In July of 2017, Marvel editor Heather Antos posted a selfie of herself with a number of
608560	611580	other women who worked at Marvel Comics getting a milkshake.
611580	616240	It was a tribute to Flo Steinberg, the most prominent female face at Marvel Comics during
616240	619360	its major boom period in the 1960s.
619360	623720	Steinberg was officially one of the only two full-time employees at Marvel, with the artists
623720	628680	largely working on a freelance basis and the only other full-timer being Stan Lee.
628680	634180	This seemingly innocuous photo prompted outrage, typically from men unhappy with the recent
634180	638600	direction of Marvel Comics, creating more titles featuring non-white male characters
638600	641560	and hiring more non-white male creators.
641580	646560	The outrage backfired pretty hard as the Make Mine Milkshake hashtag caught on, people rallied
646560	651860	around many of these women, showing solidarity in the most American way imaginable, drinking
651860	654420	a milkshake for women's rights.
654420	658260	But momentum was building, and the movement would ferment from here.
658260	662260	Although there is no central authority in the comicscape movement, we can get a vague
662260	667060	idea of their grievances by looking at the most common criticisms and demands they make
667060	669500	of what superhero comics should be.
669500	675500	Summarized as best I can from the lists I looked up online, their demands are
675500	680980	Less politics, specifically left-wing or progressive politics and stories.
680980	686640	Not hiring writers and artists on the basis of their gender, sexuality, or ethnicity.
686640	690500	Not replacing, embarrassing, or changing older heroes.
690500	695500	To have their complaints be taken seriously and not brushed aside as bigotry.
695500	700460	What's perhaps most noticeable in the language of comic skaters is that they don't consider
700460	706860	themselves a subgroup of dissatisfied comics fans, but rather they are THE comics fans.
706860	710520	They are at the core of what keeps this hobby churning along.
710520	715260	The silent majority who are frustrated with having their concerns being swept aside for
715260	720060	the sake of trying to attract an audience that does not represent actual comic fans
720060	723740	and can't possibly love the medium as much as they do.
723740	728760	It ties into the whole idea of a fake geek girl, a charge that was leveled specifically
728760	732060	at Anthos and often other female creators.
732060	737700	That a girl invading a space primarily dominated by men can't possibly be just as big a fan
737700	743620	of the subculture, or if they were real fans, they wouldn't want to make any changes.
743620	748220	It's not a coincidence that a space dominated by white men is threatened by the inclusion
748220	750980	of anyone who doesn't fit that characteristic.
750980	755540	You can see that in the implicit assumption of point number two that anyone hired to
755540	761060	work in comics that isn't a white man is likely there because of some affirmative action
761060	763460	program rather than their ability.
763460	767620	I could go on about the many shitty white male writers and artists who have worked in
767620	771820	comics without their identity being part of any criticism against them, but I really only
771820	776020	highlight these claims from the comic skate crowd so we can understand what their complaints
776020	781060	are, and as we'll see how that masks a bigotry that probably exists on a conscious
781060	783340	or unconscious level.
783340	786940	Before going on, I also want to acknowledge something important.
786940	791700	None of this animosity is new, and that I've highlighted a negative reaction to white women
791700	797100	doesn't mean it wasn't, and isn't also happening to men and women of color and LGBT
797100	798140	creators.
798140	802580	We live in a world where white women feminism tends to grab more attention than others,
802580	806220	and while I won't pretend that white women don't face prejudice in their lives, it's
806220	811580	a bit frustrating that the bigotry faced by other groups isn't as visibly opposed.
811580	815500	After the milkshake moment, a few prominent voices began to appear within the comics game
815500	816700	movement.
816700	821380	The most vocal is almost certainly Richard Meyer, who creates YouTube videos under the
821380	828660	channel name Comics and Diversity, rebranded in 2019 as Think About Comics.
828660	834140	The channel is typically Meyer commenting on issues, both physical comics and actual
834140	839660	news issues, relating to the comic industry, usually railing against characters, comics,
839660	843980	and stories he feels are being pushed upon the fans by the SJWs.
843980	847780	His videos often include him destroying comic books he doesn't like.
847780	852780	His YouTube channel has grown quite a bit, and is currently sitting at nearly 94,000
852780	856860	subscribers, and he's been featured on programs like the Jim Jefferies show.
857500	863260	We of course are rockin' those A-cups, anything above a B-cup.
863260	864980	You hate women.
864980	871420	Ms. Marvel was introduced as a Pakistani-American Muslim, Riri Williams, who replaced Iron Man.
871420	876220	If you don't like her, it's because you're racist or sexist, but probably both.
876220	878500	It would upset a racist.
878500	880260	I think it would.
880260	885660	His commentary is perhaps most notable in that it absolutely refuses to understand subtext
885660	889900	or see superhero comics as anything more than mindless entertainment.
889900	893180	As dopey as he may sound, he does have a following.
893180	899500	And in one video in particular, The Dark Roast, a private video since deleted, a darker side
899500	900500	came out.
900500	903020	Here are a few comments he made.
903020	908060	I really didn't want to read this, so I asked for some help.
908060	915260	Heather Antos is a cum dumpster who got a job at Marvel because Jordan White is a sad
915260	919740	sack perv who jacked off to her, okay?
919740	923060	The story is that she went and saw him at a convention.
923060	927540	It's like, I'd like to be an editor, and he's like, oh, this is going to be a hard sell
927540	928540	for HR.
928540	931020	Like, Jordan White's going to go to Marvel HR.
931020	932580	I really need you to hire her.
932580	936380	My spank bank is getting incredibly low.
936380	937380	What?
937380	940340	What the fuck?
940340	942820	Okay.
942820	950020	Magdalene Visagio is a fucking crazy person, a criminal, who is definitely, definitely
950020	955620	going to kill himself, and it's just where, when, and how.
955620	958980	By the way, mags did not transition.
958980	959980	Mags is a...
959980	963700	I don't even want to say this.
963700	966540	It's literally just a pervert.
966540	968420	I can't read this.
968420	969420	This, I...
969420	971620	Yeah, this is so bad.
972620	977900	Yeah, not going to read this next sentence.
977900	987340	But they came along just at the right time that we're all, oh, no.
987340	992380	But they came along just at the right time that we're all the trans issues, and they're
992380	997140	like, oh, we can weaponize this.
997140	999940	Fuck that comment, okay.
1000940	1003500	So yeah, that's the kind of guy he is.
1003500	1008060	He defended himself later on his YouTube channel, saying that these were all jokes, and shouldn't
1008060	1012180	be held against him because he only said them once.
1012180	1020300	I can't believe if you never heard the context that you're actually offended.
1020300	1024140	I can't believe that, actually, no joke.
1024140	1029900	But again, I've made 1,000 videos, 1,000 more.
1029900	1031260	Is it a pattern behavior?
1031260	1033460	Has it been repeated?
1033460	1036500	Am I doing one like this right now?
1036500	1037500	There was actually...
1037500	1039940	The plan was actually to do several of them, but after it was done, I was like, pfft, I
1039940	1040940	don't know what I'm doing.
1040940	1041940	That was lame.
1041940	1042940	It was lame.
1042940	1043940	It was forced.
1043940	1045420	I actually found it to be very boring.
1045420	1049540	When I re-listened to it five months later, I was like, this is one of my worst videos
1049540	1050540	ever.
1050540	1051540	It's so boring.
1051540	1052540	Right.
1052540	1055740	I guess if you say it once, it doesn't count.
1055740	1059140	He thinks he did a bad job in telling the jokes.
1059140	1064500	He doesn't seem to be upset with their actual content or any of the claims within them.
1064500	1068300	Meyer has also made videos alongside comic artist Ethan Van Scryver.
1068300	1072700	Although many voices of ComicsGate are typically fans outside the industry, Van Scryver was
1072700	1076760	an established artist, having worked for Marvel and DC Comics.
1076760	1081480	Most notable for having done the artwork for the dreadful Green Lantern Rebirth and Flash
1081480	1083900	Rebirth miniseries is...
1083900	1087860	Van Scryver has been something of an asshole for years, and his association with Meyer
1087860	1090380	seems to be continuing that trend.
1090380	1094500	Meyer also had another run-in with an industry pro, writer Mark Wade.
1094500	1099700	Wade has been especially prolific in his comics writing career, including a spectacular run
1099700	1105620	on Fantastic Four with Mike Waringo, and a fantastic run on Daredevil with Chris Samney.
1105620	1110100	In September of 2017, Mark Wade issued a statement on his Facebook.
1110100	1114100	This statement is in regard to the Baltimore Comic Convention.
1114100	1118620	There's a serial YouTube harasser named Richard C. Meyer who I'm told may be attending
1118620	1119620	as a fan.
1119620	1124340	If anyone sees this gentleman, or any of his friends, I need you to come find me and tell
1124340	1125340	me immediately.
1125340	1129540	Even if I'm on a panel, come up and interrupt.
1129540	1132620	And this conversation eventually happened over the phone.
1132620	1135700	Wade and Meyer chose to keep the discussion private.
1135700	1140900	Instead, following the encounter, Wade had a follow-up post on his Facebook.
1140900	1145100	The actual problem is that there are a large number of younger creators, professionals,
1145100	1149460	staffers in this industry, a larger number than you could possibly imagine who do not
1149460	1151500	have that same privilege.
1151500	1153700	In this case, a platform.
1153700	1157660	They are being harassed, repeatedly, and it's getting worse.
1157660	1161220	As I say, I've been talking with many of them over the last few weeks.
1161220	1163240	These are not histrionic people.
1163240	1165340	These are not overly dramatic people.
1165340	1170440	These are reasonable adults, some of whom cannot speak out because of their employers.
1170440	1174080	And yet, they are legitimately frightened by harassers who threaten to come find them
1174080	1177840	at conventions, at stores, at their homes.
1177840	1179960	One was told she would be burned to death.
1179960	1182440	Another was told she would be put down like a dog.
1182440	1185800	And those are examples of some of the less hateful attacks.
1185800	1190920	The Wade and Meyer conflict would grow over time and would eventually turn into a lawsuit.
1190920	1195880	Meyer had crowdfunded a comics project called Jawbreakers and was to have it published by
1195880	1201400	Antarctic Press when Wade shared some unflattering information about him and Antarctic Press
1201400	1203900	was quick to cancel their agreement.
1203900	1208360	But more importantly than the two white guys snapping at each other are the marginalized
1208360	1213440	voices who don't have the privilege of this large platform to air some of their grievances
1213440	1216440	as highlighted by Wade in his Facebook post.
1216440	1220840	This harassment is something fomented by the comicsgate crowd, going insofar as to make
1220840	1224960	blacklists and targeting comic shops that disagreed with their mission.
1224960	1229360	Before Antarctic Press ended their relationship with Meyer, a number of comic shops publicly
1229360	1231600	stated that they would not carry his title.
1231600	1236040	In response, he asked his sizable audience to find out where these stores were and create
1236040	1237040	a list.
1237040	1242200	At least one of these stores was the target of vandalism, variant edition comics in Edmonton,
1242200	1243200	Alberta.
1243200	1247240	We push positivity, we push inclusion, we push diversity.
1247240	1251320	That's why she decided to take a public stance on an issue that's dividing the comic book
1251320	1256320	world, electing not to stock an upcoming book by an author known for opposing what
1256320	1259280	he calls forced diversity in comics.
1259280	1264040	I don't know what he wants, but I feel like he just, if he wants anything, it's destruction
1264040	1265040	and regression.
1265040	1268980	The store's tweet blew up with responses from supporters and critics.
1268980	1273560	The author, Richard Meyer, even made a video response on his YouTube channel.
1273560	1276080	Variant edition in Edmonton, Canada.
1276080	1279720	They're doing multiple steps of an intimidation and blogging campaign.
1279720	1283320	I see it as a statement of, as we can get to you.
1283320	1289240	LeBlanc has nothing to go on but a gut feeling, but she's sure the crime isn't a coincidence.
1289240	1295840	For this to be a random attack at the same time as we're being press online, what else
1295840	1296920	could it be?
1296920	1300600	Another well-publicized incident occurred in late August of 2018.
1300600	1307580	Marcia, widow of beloved and extremely talented comic artist Darwin Cook, was targeted on
1307580	1312060	social media after she made a tweet about how her late husband would have absolutely
1312060	1315820	opposed the opinions and actions of the Comics Gate crowd.
1315820	1319660	The backlash against her was as predictable as it was depressing.
1319660	1324940	She had an exchange with Ethan Van Scryver that is well worth reading in its entirety.
1324940	1330660	Marcia is responding to a video in which comics artist Billy Tucci mistakenly says that Darwin
1330660	1333180	Cook would be a supporter of Comics Gate.
1333180	1335180	Hi guys, I'm right here.
1335180	1338100	And Ethan, it looks like your friends are being transphobic.
1338100	1340580	I'm sure you wouldn't support anything like that, would you?
1340580	1344060	You certainly would ask your friends to stop bringing my name up, right?
1344060	1345940	Because I haven't seen that yet.
1345940	1349500	I've been pretty happy to mute people who are harassing me on Twitter, Martha.
1349500	1350700	Or block them.
1350700	1355020	People who use my name spitefully, who lie about me, and torment me and my family over
1355020	1356820	political differences.
1356820	1359100	It goes a long way towards peace of mind.
1359100	1360700	Just mute them.
1360700	1365020	I find what goes a long way is for the ringleader to use his dog whistle to call his baby's
1365020	1366020	home.
1366020	1369940	But sure, these children are whipped up by you and it's pathetic you can't say leave
1369940	1371340	her alone to them.
1371340	1373460	Cowards, all of you.
1373460	1376420	What do you really think Darwin could do right now, Ethan?
1376420	1379660	Tell the widow to use mute or stand up to a bunch of idiots?
1379660	1382100	I know the answer.
1382100	1386060	The comics industry has become incredibly cruel, Marcia, and I don't wish you to endure
1386060	1388300	the abuse that I have over the past few months.
1388300	1392820	But I've learned quite a bit about how the internet works and how mobs are manipulated
1392820	1396460	and weaponized into endless conflict, and this isn't okay.
1396460	1400860	Ethan, I know you have felt isolated from the general industry, but you need to know
1400860	1405900	it is because most people feel you are stoking a dangerous group of fans that hate women,
1405900	1408140	people of color, and all the gay community.
1408140	1412540	That's not okay, and Darwin will not be associated with it.
1412540	1418020	They're wrong, and Darwin was also an individualist who trusted his own instincts, even when the
1418020	1420420	crowd wanted other things for him.
1420780	1423860	I'm never going to watch this or any other comicscape video.
1423860	1424860	Sorry.
1424860	1428500	I have no interest in your group and wish you personally the best in life.
1428500	1431860	I hope you snap out of this cult hypnosis at some point.
1431860	1434140	Well, I'll settle for that.
1434140	1438780	I miss you and this broke my heart, and I want you to know I think about you both often.
1438780	1441380	Please know you are loved.
1441380	1445980	Just so you know, your fans are all up on me about this and calling me trash, garbage,
1445980	1449940	and a liar, so any time you'd like to tell them to back off is great.
1449940	1452940	Darwin agreed with you on nothing and you know this.
1452940	1455340	James, I'm blocking this dude.
1455340	1457620	Tell him to apologize to Nassar.
1457620	1460300	Are you going to tell anyone to apologize to me?
1460300	1465780	Yes, SJW's in comics apologized to Marcia Cook for cynically using her as a shield to
1465780	1468940	attack comicsgate and for lying to her.
1468940	1473300	It was Darwin's dear friend Billy who claimed him for comicsgate, and I am disgusted by
1473300	1474860	this whole affair.
1474860	1477500	This wasn't fair to you or Darwin, Marcia.
1478020	1480380	Yeah, don't throw Billy under the bus here.
1480380	1484100	Billy doesn't know what your group does and was kind enough to give you five seconds of
1484100	1485100	his time.
1485100	1489140	Billy's friends are quote tweeting him and saying, Darr offered himself.
1489140	1490140	Yours are.
1490140	1493540	Billy may be a conservative, but he's nothing like you.
1493540	1496700	And this is Billy Tucci, another artist who chimes in.
1496700	1501860	I apologize for any misconception that I claimed my dear friend Darr for any cause.
1501860	1505200	Twitter is a vicious home for those who'd never confront you in person.
1505200	1507960	You all know where I stand with friends both left and right.
1507960	1511280	Hopefully soon we'll all stand in the arena of civility.
1511280	1517740	It was not a good moment for Van Scryver, particularly when he asked the SJWs to apologize
1517740	1523680	after Marcia was quite clear it was his fanbase that was harassing her.
1523680	1527940	A number of prominent industry pros came to Martha's defense, and a mantra penned by
1527940	1533240	writer Tom Taylor on Twitter a few days later was soon reposted by a number of other comics
1533240	1534240	professionals.
1534280	1539480	This was the first major anti-comicsgate display from professionals in the industry.
1539480	1544480	But again, and I feel as though I can't hit this note enough, this was a comicsgate attack
1544480	1548800	that got attention after it hit these creators close to home.
1548800	1552760	In this case, Martha herself can make the point better than I can.
1552760	1556800	Hopefully this is my last comment on the subject, but I agree with everyone saying it is annoying
1556800	1561040	that people didn't get on board the reality of what these idiots are doing until it was
1561040	1563560	a white wife attacked.
1563560	1567920	I don't think as many people would care WTF happened here, except that they were thinking
1567920	1570180	of me as an extension of a man.
1570180	1571540	So take that how you will.
1577540	1582760	While researching this video, I came across an interesting article from 2014 on ICV2 by
1582760	1588460	Rob Selkowitz titled, If comicsgate ever happens, it will be catastrophic.
1588460	1593940	It was responding to an article about gamergate by Ezra Klein, discussing how the politicization
1593940	1597140	of everything is bleeding into our hobbies.
1597140	1602540	In his article, Selkowitz highlights the dangers of longtime fans becoming self-appointed gatekeepers
1602540	1606620	to a hobby, denying entry of diverse newcomers into their space.
1606620	1611020	The danger perceived to them is the undermining of their authority in this space.
1611020	1616020	They call themselves the real or true fans of something, and anyone not adhering to this
1616020	1620820	vision is an outsider trying to destroy something closely tied to their identity.
1620820	1624700	Selkowitz goes on to point out how this sentiment has existed for a while.
1624700	1628140	Comicsgate could do the same, leaving a lasting harm to comics.
1628140	1632700	It's an interesting article and quite perceptive, though to me this fear of politicizing comics
1632700	1638020	is not a problem for the medium itself, but rather the relationship fans have with it.
1638020	1641580	Politics have long been a part of comics, and broadening the representation of different
1641580	1646740	people into comics will only increase that, at least if it happens in a society that functions
1646740	1648260	like ours does.
1648260	1651380	Here are two examples of political stories.
1651380	1655820	The character Northstar of the X-Men, one of the first openly gay characters in superhero
1655820	1658300	comics, was married in 2012.
1658300	1661580	It was the first ever gay wedding in superhero comics.
1661580	1667960	Conversely in 2013, DC Comics refused the Batwoman creative team to let their lead character
1667960	1671420	marry her female partner, Maggie Sawyer.
1671420	1676300	J.H. Williams III and W. Holden Blackman, in response, announced that they would be
1676300	1679540	leaving as the editorial team on Batwoman.
1679540	1684020	Although these would have simply been weddings in these characters' lives, the editorial
1684020	1688020	decision, one way or another, could easily be considered political.
1688020	1692320	One decision favored left-wing politics, the other right-wing politics.
1692320	1697020	When a character's wedding is considered inherently political because of their sexual
1697020	1702400	orientation, this doesn't say we're politicizing comics, but rather we live in a time when
1702400	1708000	gay marriage, and by extension someone's sexuality, is a political question.
1708000	1712180	The pattern holds true for many other types of minority representation, where characters
1712180	1716780	of color are expected to not comment on race issues, and female characters are expected
1716780	1722220	to stay silent about feminism, and especially not wear a t-shirt about it.
1722220	1726420	Wanting representation in comic books doesn't have to be an inherently political thing.
1726420	1730860	It can be as simple as some kids wanting to see a superhero who looks just like them.
1730860	1734860	It's only political when someone says it shouldn't be happening.
1734860	1739520	Ironically, their shallow understanding of comics should make the comicsgate crowd more
1739520	1742660	understanding of where these young readers are coming from.
1742660	1748080	The fact that some grown white men can't manage to read comics featuring non-white male characters
1748080	1750420	says so much more.
1750420	1755740	And if the idea of superheroes being used as a lens for slightly older readers to examine
1755740	1761180	modern-day issues from a different perspective, I'm not sure why that's inherently a bad
1761180	1762180	thing.
1762180	1766940	Obviously, it could be bad when it's done poorly, but again, I go back to a point I
1766940	1768620	made earlier in this video.
1768620	1773340	Why focus on the diversity and not, say, bad writing or bad art?
1773340	1776900	Perhaps they should be asking themselves some serious questions about diversity itself,
1776900	1782340	and why is it they get annoyed or angry whenever it's mentioned in a storyline?
1782420	1787300	The comicsgate crowd's problem isn't just its embarrassingly shallow reading of comics.
1787300	1791060	It's the hostility that foments the outright harassment of creators who are members of
1791060	1794860	the LGBT community, people of color, and women.
1794860	1799180	This is a line that is frequently crossed, often hidden from sight, that becomes part
1799180	1804020	of the daily churn of artists trying to express themselves in a medium that has been historically
1804020	1806340	dominated by white men.
1806340	1809100	It's not that white men have to be shitty to them.
1809100	1813700	It's that a portion of them are, and they refuse to behave like adults.
1813700	1817580	On the bright side, recent news on comicsgate is that it's over.
1817580	1822100	Meyer is declaring mission accomplished, and the industry has supposedly been saved from
1822100	1825580	being taken over by the SJWs.
1825580	1827500	Is comicsgate successful or unsuccessful?
1827500	1828500	I don't know.
1828500	1831420	Is customer service better or worse?
1831420	1833860	Are the comics better or worse than they were a year ago?
1833860	1839500	It seems to me the comics are better, and I'm sure there are multiple factors, but
1839500	1849580	I would say it is partly successful to the beliefs of people who liked comicsgate.
1849580	1852620	Whether comicsgate needs to go on, I don't think so.
1852620	1858420	The claims of victory and departure ring hollow to me, but it does signal that this unifying
1858420	1861380	hashtag is falling out of fashion.
1861380	1864940	In a way, this video could almost be considered a post-mortem.
1864940	1869500	But I hope if there's one thing people take away from this, is that while this childish
1869500	1875980	abusive behavior can be focused around a hashtag, even after that hashtag goes away, the problem
1875980	1878660	still exists.
1878660	1882860	Before leaving though, I want to leave us all with a few words from comics legend Stan Lee.
1882860	1887260	Although he has a checkered past, specifically in how he treated some of the artists he worked
1887260	1892220	with in Marvel's early days, he did leave us with a lovely short message before he passed
1892220	1895620	away on his thoughts about diversity in the comics industry.
1895620	1897500	Hi, heroes.
1897500	1899500	This is Stan Lee coming at you.
1899500	1906580	I just want you to know, Marvel has always been and always will be a reflection of the
1906580	1909780	world right outside our window.
1909780	1915500	That world may change and evolve, but the one thing that will never change is the way
1915500	1919340	we tell our stories of heroism.
1919340	1926700	Those stories have room for everyone, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or color
1926700	1928420	of their skin.
1928420	1936140	The only things we don't have room for are hatred, intolerance, and bigotry.
1936140	1939140	That man next to you, he's your brother.
1939140	1942420	That woman over there, she's your sister.
1942420	1945820	And that kid walking by, hey, who knows?
1945820	1950020	He may have the proportionate strength of a spider.
1950020	1957220	We're all part of one big family, the human family, and we all come together in the body
1957220	1959060	of Marvel.
1959060	1961980	And you, you're part of that family.
1961980	1969500	You're part of the Marvel universe that moves ever upward and onward to greater glory.
1969500	1973900	In other words, Excelsior.
1973900	1977260	A big thanks to Mexie for helping me out.
1977260	1980620	I'm so sorry I asked you to read something so terrible.
