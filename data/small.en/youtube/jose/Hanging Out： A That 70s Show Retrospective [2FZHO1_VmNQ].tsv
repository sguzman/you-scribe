0	4880	Through the haze of time gone by, and a loose spliff or two, came one of the first sitcoms to
4880	9600	take a nostalgic look back at the 1970s. With a knowing laugh at the fashion and trends of the
9600	14080	day, that 70s show served as a reminder of how things had changed over the last two decades,
14080	19440	and how much had stayed the same. When it debuted in 1998, the series was an instant hit,
19440	23840	becoming one of the breakout comedies for Fox in the late 90s, and launching the careers of its
23840	28800	cast. Many shows have imitated it since, but the unique chemistry of the characters and the
28800	33440	inventive style of its production made it a tough act to follow. The idea for the series began with
33440	38080	a business meeting at the Carsey-Warner Company, a production company that had been responsible for
38080	43040	such hits, including The Cosby Show, Roseanne, and Third Rock from the Sun. During the meeting,
43040	46880	it was suggested that they should start focusing their attention on producing a show for men from
46880	53040	ages 18 to 49. Karen Mandebach, who was working for the company, was struck with a sudden inspiration.
58880	63360	Mandebach pitched the idea of doing a show set in the 70s to Bonnie and Terry Turner, who had
63360	68800	recently created Third Rock from the Sun for NBC. The husband and wife duo teamed with writer Mark
68800	74160	Brazil to create a pitch for what would eventually become that 70s show. The series drew heavily from
74160	78560	the lives of its creators, hearkening back to their days growing up in the 1970s, though
78560	84000	crucially what made the series what it was, was not its reliance on making references to the decade,
84000	89040	but rather a memorable cast of characters who just happened to be living in the 1970s.
89040	93120	Memories of the era would appeal to an older demographic, while the drama of the teens would
93120	97680	appeal to a younger one. The show's creators produced a script for a series called Teenage
97680	102160	Wasteland, and while it wouldn't keep that name, it did reflect the idea of a group of teenagers
102160	106800	trapped in a small town with nothing to do but hang out. Set in the fictional town of Point Place,
106800	111680	Wisconsin, shows were less about cheering on the Packers, although they did that on occasion,
111680	116720	and more about creating a dynamic that was driven by its characters rather than its premise.
116720	120640	Topher Grace was chosen for the role of Eric Foreman through an odd twist of fate. He was
120640	124240	starring in his school's production of Our Town with the daughter of the show's creators,
124240	128320	Bonnie and Terry Turner. He impressed them so much, they brought him into audition,
128320	132160	and he got the part. The character is loosely based on writer Mark Brazil.
132160	135920	Eric is an awkward everyman teenage boy in Love with the Girl Next Door.
142640	147520	Laura Prepon played the role of Donna Pinciotti. Prepon was working as a model before trying her
147520	151840	hand at acting, and she turned out a movie role after becoming enamored with a part of Donna.
151840	156160	Donna is the tomboy of the group, with dreams outside the small town of Point Place.
156160	158880	She's also exploring her feelings for her neighbor Eric.
159760	173840	Ashton Kutcher took a direct route to his role of Michael Kelso. He had been working as a model
173840	178400	for about a year and was incredibly lucky with one of his earliest auditions being for Teenage
178400	183600	Wasteland. He was immediately a favorite of the show's creators. Kelso is the handsome,
183600	186400	yet deeply naive member of the teenage group of friends.
197120	201760	Danny Masterson was cast as Stephen Hyde. He had been performing on stage since he was eight,
201760	205920	when he had a role on Broadway, and had since gone on to appear in hundreds of commercials.
205920	209760	His input helped define the character, giving Hyde a harder edge.
209760	214560	Hyde is the street smart troublemaker of the group. He has a healthy distrust of authority
214560	228080	and an even healthier stash of pot. Wilmer Valderrama was cast for the role of the foreign
228080	232960	exchange student Fez. Although born in Miami, he grew up in Venezuela, giving him an authentic
232960	237760	accent that made him appeal to the show's creators. Fez is the perpetual fish out of water,
237760	241600	taken under the guidance of his new American friends. Although we never quite learn where
241600	245920	Fez is from, or what his name even is, he's still embraced as part of the gang.
254080	258640	Mila Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhardt. Originally born in Ukraine, her family moved
258640	262880	to America when she was seven, and she took acting classes to help with her English.
262880	267040	She quickly found success with a number of parts but went on auditioning for the role of Jackie,
267040	280960	which was looking for a 16-year-old. She lied about her age to get cast. Jackie is a spoiled
280960	285760	rich kid, only barely tolerable in the group because of her romantic connection to Kelso.
286560	300960	Deborah Jo Rupp was cast as Eric's mother, Kitty Foreman. Although a very experienced actress,
300960	305600	she had largely been doing guest roles on shows such as Seinfeld or in movies like Big. Kitty is
305600	309680	the picture-perfect image of a mother figure, holding her family together through freshly baked
309680	314480	cookies and a well-kept home. Although she's not exactly a homebody, as she also works as a nurse
314480	331840	to help the family through some tough financial times. Kurtwood Smith was cast as Eric's father,
331840	336240	Red Foreman, a longtime veteran of the screen. At the time, he was probably best remembered
336240	340960	for his role in Robocop. Red is the perpetual hard-ass, determined to make his son into the
340960	345360	man he expects him to be. When the show begins, he's struggling to put food on the table as his
345360	358960	job as manager at an auto parts factory is in peril. Don Stark was cast as Bob Pinciati,
358960	362960	Donna's father. Another prolific actor, he had appeared in numerous shows and movies in the
362960	367600	years leading up to this role. Bob is the trendy appliance store owner next door who's not afraid
367680	384240	of wearing his heart on his sleeve. Midge Pinciati, played by Tanya Roberts, was the final member of
384240	389120	the Pinciati household. An actress plucked from the 70s, Roberts joined Charlie's Angels in the
389120	393520	show's fifth season. She was also one of the Bond girls in A View to a Kill and starred in the movie
393520	398240	Sheena. Midge is the flighty lady next door who is exploring the exciting world of feminism.
407600	411840	Although the principal cast was quite large, it would grow larger still in later seasons,
411840	416720	and it would also shrink when some of the actors departed. But the action was primarily driven by
416720	421280	its main cast of teenagers, always ready to assemble in the formant basement. The theme
421280	426880	song of the series was a cover of the Big Star song In the Street. The cover was originally
426880	431040	performed by Todd Griffin for the first season of the series, but a new version was recorded by
431040	435280	Cheap Trick that would be used in seasons two through eight. When a music video is released
435280	440720	for the song, the cast even appeared alongside Cheap Trick. After the pilot was filmed, one of
440720	445360	the few things still missing was the title for the show. Teenage Wasteland was out as the show's
445360	449520	creators couldn't get the rights to that from The Who. Several other titles inspired by popular
449520	454320	music of the era faced similar problems, including such names as The Kids Are All Right.
454320	459600	Eventually that became Feelin' All Right, but Fox didn't particularly like the sound of that.
459600	463600	During test screenings of the pilot, audiences kept calling it That 70s Show.
463760	466880	That's what the audience kept calling it. They had no clue what the title was. They just
467520	472080	referred to it as That 70s Show. So we stopped fighting it and went with it.
476080	485280	Point Place, Wisconsin, May 17th, 1976, 847 p.m. Location, Eric Forman's Basement.
485920	491440	This is how we're introduced to the gang of That 70s Show, debuting in the real world on August
491440	499280	23rd, 1998. This first episode was called That 70s Pilot. We meet Eric, Donna, Hyde, and Kelso
499280	504400	in the basement, with the latter three encouraging Eric to do his teenage duty and steal some beer
504400	514480	from his parents who are having a party upstairs. As Eric goes upstairs, we get our first look at
514480	518480	That 70s Show's unique style with a first-person view from Eric's perspective.
526000	530160	One fun bit of trivia here is that we get the first appearance of Kitty's iconic laugh,
530160	532160	a laugh that was done accidentally.
544480	560160	We also get our first sign that Donna and Eric are into each other.
574480	588160	The Jackie and Kelso relationship is also established.
588160	607280	We also get our very first circle, which is how the teens on the show would gather while getting
607280	613040	high. You couldn't show someone smoking pot on a TV show, but That 70s Show got around this by
613040	617760	moving the camera on someone just after they had taken a puff. That way it simulates a joint,
617760	622480	being passed around in a circle without actually showing the joint itself. You can even see the
622480	627360	characters break into laughter a few times, which was kept in because it seemed authentic. They just
627360	631840	have the giggles because they're high. The show had some fun with high Eric when he has to speak
631840	636480	to his parents, and he finds out that he's getting the vista cruiser. This is another fun example of
636480	646080	its creative style. Future episodes would also take liberties with split screens and
646080	650480	voiceovers and edits to create something that you often didn't see in sitcoms of the day.
668480	672640	With a new set of wheels, Eric and his friends go out of town to a concert and get up to some
672640	677840	shenanigans. But the key part of this episode happens at the end with a pivotal moment for Don
677840	700640	and Eric. This first episode establishes the characters very quickly. We know who they are
700640	704880	and how they relate to one another. This show will be primarily about Eric discovering his
704880	709440	first love and rebelling against a domineering father. What also makes the show feel genuine
709440	713600	is that, while you can certainly tell it's set in the 70s, the kids aren't slavishly following
713600	718000	the trends to set up cheap jokes. They have their own tastes, and the humour is built around that.
718000	734720	In this example, Eric and Donna are mocking the Brady Bunch, but Jackie is a fan. It shows us that
734720	739360	Jackie is into the trendy sitcoms of the day, whereas Eric and Donna are more outsiders to
739360	744480	pop culture. Jackie is conventional, while Eric and Donna aren't. This is how the decade informs
744480	749200	us about the characters, rather than using the characters as a vessel to explore the decade. In
749200	754160	other words, it's how it establishes itself as a character-driven comedy rather than a premise-driven
754160	759120	one. It's also interesting how it reframes memories of the 70s. It's not a show from that decade,
759120	764720	after all. Rather, it's a show about what people from the 90s remembered about the 70s. And sitting
764720	771120	here, over 20 years later, were even more removed from the era. As someone who wasn't alive in 1976,
771120	775520	I have no idea if teenagers mocked the Brady Bunch or not. But I do remember what it was like
775520	779840	to have my first kiss, which is a big part of why the show is so fondly remembered. Not because it
779840	784640	captured an era, but because it presented memorable characters whose experiences transcended that time
784640	789360	period. We get another example in the very next episode, Eric's birthday. Eric wants a cassette
789440	792640	player for the Vista Cruiser, and not an eight-track player.
792640	796240	The point is, I don't want an eight-track tape player.
796240	797200	Then you won't get one.
797200	798480	Oh, but honey, he wants one.
799120	801680	No, I want a tape player, just not an eight-track.
801680	803600	So naturally, he gets this.
804240	806000	I mean, yeah.
807680	809200	It's an eight-track tape player.
810640	811600	I see that.
811600	812800	Just what you asked for.
812800	814800	You made such a big deal about it, I wrote it down.
815360	819440	If a 17-year-old was watching this episode, would they know the difference between an
819440	823680	eight-track and a cassette player? Here's a picture of both of them. A lesser show would
823680	827520	have had the characters hold up a cassette player and make a comment about it being cutting-edge
827520	832560	technology, never to be surpassed. That might get a chuckle, but it's a laugh you probably wouldn't
832560	837120	remember. On that 70s show, it's not about laughing at the technology of the past. It's
837120	841200	about laughing at growing up with parents who don't listen. That's something you can laugh at
841200	845840	and relate to, and it's what makes this show particularly memorable. Eric's birthday also
845840	850560	introduced another important first, Eric's sister, Laurie, played by Lisa Robin Kelly.
851280	852000	Hello, Laurie.
853440	857040	Red treats Laurie a little differently than he does Eric.
857040	859120	Laurie, you're not driving a vista cruiser.
859840	861600	It's old and undependable.
861600	864800	It could break down, you'd be at the mercy of any maniac who came along.
865840	869440	That's okay for Eric, but you're taking a Toyota.
869440	873680	And I should mention, not every scene in the circle involved passing a joint around.
873680	878000	That 70s show ran for eight seasons, though it only took place over roughly three and a half
878000	882080	years. If you've ever been watching an episode and wondering when exactly you are, at the end
882080	885680	of the opening credits when we see the vista cruiser's license plate, the renewal sticker
885680	889920	tells us which year the episode is set in. This does make things a little awkward at times,
889920	895520	as the timeline, particularly because of episodes with holidays, doesn't always line up. By honing
895520	901040	in on each year, we can split the series up into four distinctive eras. And as we follow the lives
901040	906320	of these characters, we'll see how the series gradually evolves. That 70s show spends only a
906320	912240	brief stretch in 1976. In fact, only the first 12 episodes of the series take place in that year,
912240	918880	before we move on to 1977 for the second half of the first season. One exception is Episode 23 of
918880	924160	Season 1, which also takes place in 1976, in part because the order of the episodes was
924160	929360	shuffled around while airing. This creates a few instances of confusing continuity, like Eric
929360	934880	mentioning he and Hyde hadn't yet sprayed the water tower when we had seen them do just that
934880	938720	in the episode that aired the previous week. In addition to Eric and Donna's love affair,
938720	943840	one of the big overarching themes in these early episodes is the precarious economic spot of the
944800	948960	I've noticed that the pop selection has really went downhill since your dad got laid off.
948960	956560	He's not laid off. He's just part-time. And shut up. When the president comes to visit point
956560	960720	place, Red is selected to ask the president a question. When he's given a question,
960720	968800	rather than being allowed to ask his own, Red gets frustrated. A man has to stand up and be heard.
968800	974720	I will not sit quietly by while everything is taken away from me.
976560	983760	They took my job, my stability, and now they want to take away my right of free speech.
984960	987360	You still have the Toyota, it gets great mileage.
988960	994720	It being 1976, the president right now is Gerald Ford, who assumed office after Richard Nixon
994720	999200	resigned. This is why Nixon was on the cusp of being impeached and removed from office.
999200	1002720	What Red is feeling here is not just the indifference towards him from the federal
1002720	1007440	government, but the general sense that America is leaving him behind, and that the country is
1007440	1012560	corrupt from top to bottom, letting him lose his job as he's lost in the shuffle of the marketplace.
1012560	1016800	What Red doesn't realize is the America he thought he knew as a boy wasn't a whole lot better,
1016800	1021680	or at least not as free as he imagined it was. It's not so much that the country has changed,
1021680	1026240	as he just happens to be one of the people it's left behind. And the show doesn't make it such
1026240	1031360	a big secret here that the problem lies much with a business class that uses people like Red as pawns.
1031360	1036320	Bob, a member of the local community of businessmen, represents that world when he thinks of Red to
1036320	1041440	ask the president a question. The important thing is to choose the right person. You know,
1041440	1046720	a working class guy, your average Joe. I guess someone you and I would call a loser.
1046720	1052160	So, of course, I thought of you.
1053280	1055920	Although Red planned to go off script at the presidential event,
1055920	1060880	at first he seems a bit too nervous to ask any question at all. But after Erica makes
1060880	1064960	a rash political protest by streaking the president, Red finds his nerve.
1064960	1071600	Hey, Jerry. Here's my question. How the hell could you pardon Nixon?
1071600	1079120	Sometimes a man's gotta do what he thinks is right.
1080400	1085280	These early episodes probably have Red at his most relatable, perhaps because of the economic
1085280	1089280	insecurity that people are feeling in the present day, and something that people in the 90s might
1089280	1094240	have felt as well when this show was first airing. And back then, it was when a booming economy was
1094240	1100240	raising questions about who the economy is exactly booming for. One of the early plot lines, just to
1100320	1104800	get the obvious out of the way, was having the gang go disco dancing. One part of this
1104800	1116960	episode has Fez noticing one of the disco's inspirations. And Fez is revealed to be a fantastic
1116960	1121760	dancer. Although Fez is a mystery throughout the series, it's early on when he's at his best.
1121760	1126240	He seems like he's genuinely from somewhere, with a history and culture that only seems
1126240	1130960	especially foreign in contrast to the relative ignorance of the largely white small town in
1130960	1135200	middle America. There's something sweet seen Fez struggling to understand American culture,
1135200	1138960	and it offers members of the audience less familiar with 70s culture the chance to have
1139040	1161440	it explained to them in a less heavy-handed way. There will be much more to say about Fez as the
1161440	1166000	series progresses, but over time this innocence would vanish, and we'd be left with another
1166000	1178000	early trait he showed in these episodes, being a bit of a creep. The early episodes of That 70
1178000	1184080	Show also featured a landmark moment in TV history. In the episode, Eric's Buddy, We Meet Buddy,
1184080	1189200	played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Eric's lab partner and one of the most popular kids in school.
1189200	1194240	As their friendship grows, so does a misunderstanding, at least in Buddy's mind.
1194240	1198480	And I feel like I'm playing this part, right? But it's not me.
1207280	1213280	This is the first kiss between two men on network TV. Although sometimes that's credited to the
1213280	1218240	Dawson's Creek episode True Love, Eric's Buddy beat its air by about five months.
1218240	1222480	Eric being straight has to turn Buddy down, but the two agree to stay friends.
1222480	1225840	If you don't want to be my lab partner anymore, then I'll understand.
1225840	1235520	No, no. Oh, I didn't mean it like that. Um, look, we're still friends. Really? Yeah.
1236320	1241840	And as the rules of sitcoms go, with a one-off guest star destined to be a one-off guest star,
1241840	1246960	we never see Buddy again. At the time, this moment was heralded as a very positive depiction of a
1246960	1251600	gay character. Buddy is cool, popular, and charming, not at all living up to any of the
1251600	1256240	stereotypes of gay characters you might see on other shows, including this one in later seasons.
1256240	1261280	The episode was even nominated for a GLAAD Award as an outstanding TV individual episode.
1261280	1265200	What's probably most notable about this moment is the audience's reaction, though,
1265200	1269040	which is genuine shock from something they likely hadn't seen on a TV show before.
1269040	1273200	Looking at it 20 years later, it seems almost tame compared to modern television,
1273200	1277600	and it's a little disappointing to see Buddy play the token gay character who's there and gone now
1277600	1282400	that the gay episode has been handled. It does reveal how little representation there was for
1282400	1287360	gay characters on TV at this time, and perhaps what makes it age less gracefully is that it was on
1287360	1292080	the cusp of a growing change in television, which would see an increase in the number of gay
1292080	1296960	characters on sitcoms. Buddy wasn't even the first character to appear on the series, as the pilot
1296960	1302000	featured a gay couple, one of whom was a mechanic who traded a car part for concert tickets to the
1302000	1315760	gang. Aside from these brief moments, the romance on the show was overwhelmingly heterosexual,
1315760	1320240	and one of the top concerns for its characters. Jackie and Kelso, being the established couple
1320240	1324880	in the beginning, struggle to stay together. Or rather, Kelso is constantly trying to convince
1324880	1337760	his friends he's about to dump his very annoying girlfriend. Knowing that Mila Kunis is only 15
1337760	1342320	throughout season 1 does make a few of the scenes a bit uncomfortable to watch, though because of
1342320	1346960	the age difference between her and Ashton Kutcher, who was 20 at the time, most of the scenes where
1346960	1351600	they're making out happen hidden behind car seats and other obstacles. Kelso's attraction
1351600	1356720	to Lori in particular reveals he's not entirely committed to Jackie, and while Lori is no stranger
1356720	1373760	to hooking up, Kelso's chances largely only exist in his head. Of course, the biggest romantic
1373760	1378640	plotline in the early episodes is the Eric and Donna relationship. It's immediately obvious from
1378640	1382720	the first episode that these two would be getting together, so a bit of intrigue is thrown into the
1382720	1387440	middle of it, with Hyde attempting to create a love triangle. A few flirtations from Hyde
1387440	1392160	doesn't really do much to interrupt Eric and Donna getting closer, often in the most embarrassing
1392160	1411280	way possible. As the year comes to an end, Eric and his friends hold their own Christmas party.
1411280	1414400	It's about as close as Hyde gets to winning Donna's affections.
1422160	1437680	Even with this magical Christmas, Eric and Donna still seem like the couple destined to be together,
1437680	1441840	and by the time Valentine's Day rolls around next year, this subplot is put to bed,
1441840	1444640	with Hyde backing off after being rejected by Donna.
1452160	1471440	Throughout 1976, the innocence of the series is apparent, with Brad losing a kind of innocence
1471440	1476480	when he learns that America isn't the land of dreams he once imagined. Through Fez's ignorance
1476480	1481600	of his new homeland, in Eric and the gang learning about gay people, and Eric and Donna discovering
1481600	1486240	their first love. The world is becoming a more complicated place, and the idealized version of
1486240	1490800	the world these characters imagined is fading away. This is a common theme in most coming-of-age
1490800	1495120	stories, but it feels even more prominent on that 70s show, because we in the audience have the
1495120	1500160	advantage of knowing a future that these characters don't. We may not know what happens in our future,
1500160	1503520	but we know at least some of the major events that will happen in theirs.
1512080	1516720	And their ignorance of those facts helps make the impression of innocence even more pronounced.
1520800	1525840	Once Hyde stepped aside from the Eric and Donna pairing, it gave his character the
1525840	1530960	chance to grow into something more interesting. In the season 1 episode Career Day, we meet Hyde's
1530960	1536320	mother Edna, played by Katie Seagal. She works as the school's lunch lady, and she has a troubled
1536320	1537360	relationship with Hyde.
1567280	1570880	This is sadly the last we see of Hyde's mother Edna, though he would have a number
1570880	1575280	of father figures throughout the years, including Red. In the episode Punk Chick,
1575280	1579840	when Hyde falls for Chrissy, played by Jade Gordon, he's tempted to follow her to New York,
1579840	1581600	where she plans to start a punk band.
1597280	1600880	Red and Kitty try to convince Hyde not to run off to New York.
1614880	1615920	And so does Eric.
1626320	1643760	Hyde eventually decides to stay in point place.
1649200	1652720	Although it's never made clear whose advice convinced Hyde to stay,
1652720	1656960	we do learn that what Hyde is missing most in his life is the good influence of the Foreman
1656960	1662160	household. Something that becomes essential when Edna runs off with a trucker at the end of season
1662160	1664000	1, leaving Hyde without a home.
1674000	1677120	Even though Edna's not coming back, Hyde rejects help at first.
1677120	1681040	But Eric goes to his parents, who are struggling to afford the kids they already have.
1683520	1692720	Ultimately, it's Red who has to step up and make the decision to help Hyde,
1692720	1694240	with some encouragement from Kitty.
1712720	1720240	And Hyde quickly makes himself the model son in the Foreman household.
1734240	1738400	What this consistently reinforces is that Hyde needs a stable family life,
1738400	1742640	and in particular a father figure like Red to keep him on the straight and narrow path.
1742640	1746240	It's a very old-fashioned message. A young boy needs a father figure.
1746240	1750240	In the second season, Hyde even gets a second quasi-father figure in Leo,
1750240	1752720	played by Tommy Chong, who gives Hyde a job.
1768400	1778720	The money goes towards the noble goal of supporting the Foreman household.
1790560	1795520	Hyde is the model wayward child, taken under the wing of a strong father who sets him on the right
1795520	1800480	path, and by season 2 he's slowly transforming into a respectable member of society. It's a sort
1800480	1805120	of arc you might see in a family drama from the 70s, though thankfully that 70s show doesn't fit
1805120	1810240	so neatly into that sentimental cliché. In the season 2 finale, moon over point place,
1810240	1813920	Jackie is busted for holding marijuana, and Hyde takes the fall for her.
1814880	1825920	And then Red finds out.
1832560	1836400	Red threatens to kick Hyde out, but Jackie eventually takes responsibility for what
1836400	1840880	happened, and Hyde is allowed to stay in the Foreman household. Hyde was on a promising path,
1840880	1845280	but to save Jackie, he throws himself in harm's way. What's particularly interesting is how he
1845280	1850560	does it, though. He calls himself a dirtbag, and in some ways Hyde still sees himself like that,
1850560	1854480	in spite of all of the work he's done on improving while living with the Foreman's.
1854480	1858240	The Foreman's can take him in and give him a home and give structure to his life,
1858240	1863600	but in his heart he still sees himself as an outsider. Hyde is a strong representative for
1863600	1870160	1977, because if 1976 was about the loss of innocence, 1977 is about finding this new
1870160	1875120	sense of home in a strange new world. Only Hyde has felt that way through most of his life.
1875120	1878880	As much as he had hoped his mother would pull herself together and be a better parent,
1878880	1883360	going so far as to be the bigger person and apologize first when they fight, he ultimately
1883360	1887120	can't get her to be the mother he needs, and when the Foreman's offer him a new home,
1887120	1891600	he can't see himself as a part of it. At least, not right away. The show's answer,
1891600	1896400	at least in this year, takes the shape of Bud, Hyde's father, played by Robert Hayes.
1896400	1899440	He returns to point place, and after he's discovered by Hyde,
1899440	1901840	tries to make amends for abandoning his son.
1902800	1909040	Bud, you're doing great now, huh? Color TV? I remember when I was a kid, I didn't even have
1909040	1913840	a father. I got no excuse. I was a jerk. I've been a jerk my whole life.
1916080	1920720	And all I can do is tell you I'm sorry and hope that you'll believe me.
1920720	1925680	But even if this seems like recreating the childhood he lost, there are hints that this won't last
1925680	1954720	either. There is this strange episode where Red tries to teach Bud how to be a better father.
1955680	1960640	Steven doesn't need another friend, Bud. Steven needs somebody to ride his ass.
1960640	1966320	It seems as though the answer to Hyde's feeling of alienation is… more strict fathering,
1966320	1971360	from a blood relation this time. But as we'll see in later years, Hyde's life is not so easily
1971360	1975680	fixed with that, and his rebellious streak isn't something that needs to be disciplined out of him,
1975680	1979600	but rather channeled into something more productive, such as protecting a friend,
1979680	1985920	the way he stood up for Jackie. Jackie and Kelso had had something of a rocky year in 1977. In the
1985920	1991360	very first episode of that year, Season 1's ski trip, Jackie breaks up with Kelso after finding
1991360	1995360	out he was making out with Pam Macy. They get back together by the end of the episode, though,
1995360	2000400	but this would establish a pattern. Four episodes later, in the episode titled The Pill,
2000400	2005440	Jackie has a pregnancy scare. After Kelso melts down in response, they break up again.
2005440	2007920	Only to get back together in the episode, Prom Night.
2011840	2016800	In Season 2, their relationship is tested once again with Eric's sister Lori becoming a part
2016800	2020320	of the main cast. She takes an interest in Kelso and his new van.
2020320	2036800	This isn't Lori falling for Kelso, though. It's something a bit more basic than that.
2037760	2050320	Much of the season then focuses on Kelso trying to balance
2050320	2053280	dating Jackie with cheating on her with Lori.
2061680	2066560	While Kelso was clearly the bad guy in all of this, he might be mistaken as being a hapless
2066560	2071600	fool being used by Lori. Eventually, the truth comes out in Kiss of Death. Kelso has finally
2071600	2076400	realized that the genuine love of Jackie means more to him than the lust represented by Lori,
2076400	2096400	and he decides to break things off with her. While Lori is
2096400	2101760	always insufferable, it's pretty clear that this is, and has always been, Kelso's fault.
2101760	2106320	More than just being a fool, he actively hurt Jackie, and when she ends things with him,
2106320	2109920	it looks like it will be sticking around for longer than an episode or two this time.
2109920	2126880	And so ends the show's first relationship.
2139920	2156720	Jackie seemed like a challenging person to date, but it doesn't excuse what Kelso did to her,
2156720	2160640	and with naive Kelso being the more affable character in the affair, it's interesting
2160640	2165200	that he was the bad guy in the whole thing. Often in stories of an infidelity, characters are more
2165200	2169680	helpfully coded as heroes or villains of the story, but especially for a sitcom, the dynamic
2169680	2175600	here is surprisingly not straightforward. It shows us how trust is broken by deeds rather than persona,
2175600	2180880	and that someone's personality doesn't always tell you who they are as a person. At least, not
2180880	2186000	entirely. Although it took many twists and turns to get here, Jackie and Kelso both get the chance
2186000	2190960	to grow beyond the high school romance they had. Jackie moves on to other romantic interests,
2190960	2196240	as the show teases her possibly dating Hyde or Fez, while Kelso tries to date Lori for real.
2196240	2200960	This leads to some classic confrontations between the two ladies in the Foreman basement.
2221200	2225040	Eventually, and completely unsurprisingly, Lori cheats on Kelso,
2236480	2238240	and he apologizes to Jackie.
2250960	2262800	Kelso's apology is pretty good, and in time he realizes that the only woman he wants to be with
2262800	2268480	is Jackie. Jackie still might be interested in him, so she tests Kelso to see if he's truly changed.
2281360	2286880	And we're back where we started. Albeit with Kelso seeming to have grown up a little, and Jackie
2286880	2291520	deciding to forgive him again. Although it's nice enough for Kelso to have become a more mature
2291520	2295760	character, it does reveal that the show wasn't entirely sure how to evolve Jackie. While her
2295760	2299680	being a year younger than everyone else in the gang, and two years younger than Kelso who is held
2299680	2304400	back a grade, it still seems odd that she's only been able to identify herself based on whether or
2304400	2309600	not she's dating someone. She's of course rich and popular, but after the first season, these
2309600	2314080	aspects of her character seem less important, as neither are quite as relevant when she's hanging
2314080	2318400	out with the other characters. Aside from being fodder for a few jokes here and there. Much in
2318400	2323040	the same way Hyde's answer to the alienation he felt was to end up back with his father, Jackie and
2323040	2328080	Kelso respond to their separation in the same way. Fear of the new normal certainly makes sense, and
2328080	2332880	it reveals that perhaps these teens aren't quite ready to step into adulthood just yet. They've
2332880	2337120	still got some growing to do. Another reason Jackie and Kelso may have been put together is because
2337120	2342240	Lisa Robin Kelly, who played Laurie on the show, exited the series in season 3. Although her
2342240	2347280	character was adding a lot to the show, the actress was having personal issues behind the scenes. In
2347280	2352080	an interview with ABC in 2012, she described having had a miscarriage at the time and then falling
2352080	2356320	into alcoholism. Although she would briefly return in season 5 for four more episodes,
2356320	2360560	Laurie would eventually be recast, with Christina Marr taking over the part.
2360560	2364560	Eric and Donna's relationship becomes official in the second half of season 1,
2364560	2368080	with the first step being Eric giving Donna his class ring.
2368080	2370960	And in season 2, they finally say they love each other.
2382880	2384880	Well, Eric says it eventually.
2384880	2394400	And after nearly two seasons, the two of them finally do it in the episode, the first time.
2394400	2399360	Eric and Donna have largely made the journey comfortably, and 1977 is probably their best
2399360	2403520	year as a couple. They handle most challenges that come their way pretty well, with my favorite being
2403520	2408640	the episode, Eric's Panties, where Donna finds a mysterious pair of panties in the backseat of
2408640	2413280	the Vista Cruiser. She assumes they belong to Shelly, a girl who had been flirting with Eric,
2413360	2414960	played by Mamet Patterson.
2438160	2441440	Even with things mostly going well for the two, the third season's episode,
2441440	2447280	Baby Fever, did give us a hint that Eric and Donna might not have the happy ending they imagined.
2460640	2463840	And the comfort Donna gets from Midge has an ominous undertone.
2471440	2487040	One interesting part of why Donna and Eric clash is that Donna wants more for herself
2487040	2491600	than to be a housewife, unlike what happened to her mother, whereas Eric is modeling his future
2491600	2495840	on what he sees with his parents. One of the keys to understand Donna and Eric's mindsets
2495840	2500000	is to look at what their parents were going through in the same year. In 1976, Red was
2500000	2504240	struggling to put food on the table as his hours were reduced at the auto plant. In a special
2504240	2508880	Star Wars themed episode called A New Hope, we find out that the plant is going to be shut down
2508880	2513760	for good, leaving Red without a job. This leaves the Foreman's in a rough spot.
2530000	2541040	While it seems dire, Red gets an opportunity to turn things around when a Price Mart opens up in
2541040	2552800	town. On the other side of the property line, Bob is threatened by the arrival of Price Mart.
2553200	2563280	While Red may not seem like the best of friends to Bob, his reasons for going after that job
2563280	2577040	make a lot of sense, as his family heads closer to going broke. For Bob though, Price Mart is the
2577040	2587440	beginning of the end of his appliance store, and it goes under in season 3. Red throughout his life
2587440	2592560	is at the mercy of the big businesses that come and go through point place. When the auto industry
2592560	2597680	started outsourcing abroad for its parts, his plant got shut down and he was out of work. But
2597680	2602320	when a big box retail store opens up, he suddenly has a job again. There isn't much room for him to
2602320	2607680	decide where his life will go. At first it seems as though Bob is the wiser person, investing in
2607680	2612400	his own business and providing comfortably for his family, until a big business comes in and turns it
2612400	2617040	all upside down, leaving him without a job. Bob isn't quite the master of his destiny that he
2617040	2621680	imagined, and even though he was a big wheel in the business community in point place, there are
2621680	2626960	always bigger fish outside that very little pond. When we look at Eric and Donna, we can see their
2626960	2631520	parents' outlooks reflected in their own lives. Eric has a more traditional conservative vision
2631520	2636080	for his future because the system seems to be keeping his family afloat. Even if times can get
2636080	2641680	tough, eventually it all works out. For Donna, her father's failure reflects a system that shows how
2641680	2646320	a bigger force can wipe you away in an instant. This is compounded by Eric growing up as a boy
2646320	2652080	and Donna as a girl. Eric is comforted in the idea that society has been built for someone like him,
2652080	2657200	and challenges are temporary roadblocks. Whereas Donna knows she has an uphill battle. When luck
2657200	2661520	turns against Bob, she's reminded of a system that doesn't work for her, but rather only values
2661520	2665520	her as a commodity. And when she looks at her mother, she sees someone who's opportunity at
2665520	2669920	being something other than a housewife taken from her because she happened to get pregnant at a young
2669920	2675200	age. So Eric assuming he and Donna will just get married and settled down, while Donna dreams of
2675200	2680240	something more, explain why there might be some confusion on where the relationship is headed.
2680240	2685200	The irony for Eric is that he's wrong to have any faith in the system. Red getting a job at
2685200	2690640	Price Smart, saving their family from financial peril, is pure luck. To be fair, Red had originally
2690640	2695680	been offered a job as a cashier, and then insisted on a management position. But even with the benefit
2695680	2700720	of his hard head, that opportunity would be nothing if Price Smart hadn't chosen to open up a store
2700720	2706160	in point place. But Eric does have the opportunity to learn better, and that comes in the shape of
2706160	2711040	his mother Kitty. Kitty works as a nurse at a nearby hospital, a job she took on to help the
2711040	2715920	family with her finances. When Eric goes to the hospital with Kitty for career day, he learns just
2715920	2721040	how capable she is. You know, your mom does the work of five nurses. This place would fall apart
2721040	2728240	without her. And she's so funny. Oh yeah, she is. Um, wait, no, she's not. And even more than that,
2728240	2733200	Eric learns about one of the real challenges of working at a hospital. I mean, for Mr. Anderson,
2733200	2736400	but you knew this guy, mom. How do you deal with all of this?
2749840	2754560	While Eric and his mother would bond as the seasons went on, Kitty never quite becomes the
2754560	2759280	force in the foreman household that Red is. If her job as a nurse symbolizes her strength,
2759280	2763920	it's telling that she seems to quit and go back throughout the series, which reflects an
2763920	2770080	insecurity in her status. That insecure status manifests in Eric, who has a less than perfect
2770080	2775120	understanding that Donna wants to be more than a homemaker. Eric assumes his mother is happiest at
2775120	2781120	home, when we'll see in later seasons that isn't really the case. For Donna, her faith in relationships
2781120	2785760	is also reflected in how her parents seem to be falling apart in theirs. As Midge empowers herself
2785760	2790480	through attempting to understand feminist theory, Bob grows worried that it may make her want to
2790480	2796160	start becoming a radical and do something crazy, like get a job. Well, I'm the man of the house,
2796160	2802720	and I say you're not going to community college. You can't tell me what to do, you big ass.
2804960	2809520	Midge's interest in feminism is a bit fleeting, though, as she and Bob seem to drift with
2809520	2813280	every fad that comes their way, from fondue to nudism.
2813280	2817360	They used to be normal. What the hell happened to them?
2818000	2822000	Well, I don't know. How can she not eat meats? That can't be healthy.
2822800	2826960	And over time, we find out that Bob and Midge just aren't happy together.
2826960	2830800	Donna, your mother was fine until she met those feminists and started thinking.
2833120	2836080	Well, excuse me, Bob, but I'm not happy.
2836080	2840640	With her parents constantly fighting, the last thing Donna wants to create is a mere image of
2840640	2844880	them with Eric. And without that positive role model for a happy relationship, she wants to
2844880	2849200	create something new and different. Although feminism was a passing interest for Midge,
2849200	2854480	it seems to have had a stronger impact on Donna. Hyde, Red, Jackie, and Kelso all respond to the
2854480	2860400	changes of 1977 with a return to the familiar. For Hyde, it's a chance to have a father again.
2860400	2864800	For Red, it's back to working as management in the corporate machine. For Jackie and Kelso,
2864800	2870000	it's giving their troubled relationship another chance. But for Bob, he can't go back to running
2870000	2874320	a store again, and he and Midge aren't returning to the happy marriage they once had. So Eric and
2874320	2879040	Donna have to ask themselves where they are in this year of change, going down the familiar
2879040	2882560	path of Eric's parents, or finding something completely new.
2886400	2892000	1978 brought with it some major changes to the show. Eric is slowly realizing the relationship
2892000	2897760	he has isn't like the one his mom and dad have. Eric tries to escalate his relationship with Donna
2897760	2903120	by giving her a promise ring in the season 3 finale. As Donna considers the meaning of this
2903120	2909200	promise ring, she realizes she's not ready for the commitment it represents. So she gives it back to Eric.
2909200	2914560	The important thing is when you see yourself in Paris, or wherever, I'm there, right?
2919040	2930960	Right? I don't know. Not always. We're together now. Isn't that enough? No! I mean...
2933600	2937360	I mean damn, Donna! If you can see a future for yourself without me,
2937360	2940880	and that doesn't like break your heart, then we're not doing what I thought we were doing here,
2940880	2945120	and you know what? Maybe we shouldn't even be together at all. Are you breaking up with me?
2946160	2949040	Well, are you getting back that ring?
2952080	2953920	That's... Then...
2958320	2965280	Yes. It's ironically not the present that breaks up Eric and Donna, but the future,
2965280	2970400	and their different visions for it. Donna wants to see where life will take her, and Eric wants
2970400	2976000	to start building a life he already imagines. And ironically, they end up heading into a direction
2976000	2981120	neither of them wanted. After the breakup, Eric is left shattered in a way that anyone who's
2981120	2986640	gone through their first breakup can probably relate to. Geez, huh? You look like you've just
2986640	2994000	been dumped! Later on, Red actually offers some good advice. Listen, I'm gonna give you a few
2994000	3003360	days to pull yourself together. You can stand bad and sleep, watch TV, whatever you need to do.
3005680	3011680	Thank you, Dad. The fallout of Donna and Eric's split would play out over several episodes,
3011680	3016960	with the two of them learning how to live among one another after some really nasty post-breakup
3016960	3022160	feelings. But this moment where Eric and Red bond is surprisingly sweet, and in many ways
3022160	3026800	emblematic of how the two have been growing increasingly close over the previous seasons.
3026800	3029920	Sometimes it took the shape of Eric standing up to Red.
3029920	3033040	Now you screwed yourself when you didn't return those books! Now go!
3034080	3036160	Okay. No.
3039920	3042400	Sometimes the bonding happened on a hunting trip.
3043040	3046160	I think you're angry, because life didn't turn out exactly the way you wanted it to.
3046720	3052400	And, uh, maybe you think if you yell at me, I won't let life push me around, too.
3056080	3057840	You came up with that answer awful fast.
3059520	3065440	Eric and Red's relationship is built on Eric's rebellion while understanding who his father is,
3065440	3071600	and Red trying to make Eric who he thinks Eric needs to be. By reconciling all of these things,
3071600	3076720	Eric is able to grow himself. Red is both a role model and cautionary tale for Eric,
3076720	3082080	and he takes the lesson to heart. But Red is also a father to him that offers comfort and love when
3082080	3086480	he needs it the most, like in that moment after his breakup with Donna. But there is something
3086480	3091520	in the relationship that's shaped by the less enlightened era Red comes from, where emotions
3091520	3096400	aren't so easily shared, such as when Red lies about crying after being dumped.
3096400	3125200	It's a major event when Red tells Eric he loves him.
3126400	3135760	I'm sorry, what?
3136720	3139280	When Kitty finds out Red was hopped up on medication,
3139280	3143200	she tries to stop Eric from returning the gesture.
3156400	3160640	Go to your room.
3162080	3166320	Red tries to explain the rules around saying I love you for men.
3166320	3169200	When he's drunk, when he's dying,
3170160	3172480	or when he's in big trouble and it's the only way out.
3173680	3174400	Other than that.
3174400	3177600	Other than that, it's just a given.
3178560	3183520	While the idea that love is simply understood is nice, but it's clear from the rest of this episode
3183520	3188240	that everyone understands that saying it out loud means something too, something more than that
3188240	3193760	implicit understanding offers. That outward expression of emotion is not something Red can
3193760	3199040	offer Eric. The relationship of a cold father to an emotionally needy son is an old trope,
3199040	3204080	and by setting it in the 70s, maybe it seems more acceptable. But being a show from the 90s,
3204080	3208800	it was aware of how limited this relationship could be, and watching 20 years on, it becomes
3208800	3212800	more apparent. Fathers and sons should be able to say they love one another without
3212800	3217120	slamming face first into this cliché of what masculinity should be.
3217120	3221600	There's still a lot of positives between Eric and Red, but something as simple as them being
3221600	3226080	open with their feelings is a sad limit for what could have been a more meaningful relationship.
3226080	3230880	1978 brought with it the departure of Mitch. Growing so frustrated with her marriage to Bob,
3230880	3232720	she takes off for California.
3232720	3235920	I can't believe she would just take off without even a hint or a warning.
3236720	3240560	No warning? Dad, she was always saying I'm unhappy and I'm gonna leave.
3242960	3245280	I mean, that's just what married people say.
3246640	3250080	Donna luckily has kitty to be there for her as a mother figure.
3250080	3252880	But it's been so nice having someone to talk to since my mom left.
3253600	3257920	I know. Someone who understands what I'm going through.
3257920	3261520	Behind the scenes, the reason Tanya Roberts loved the show was to care for her husband,
3261520	3265920	who had become terminally ill. Roberts would appear in later seasons in a handful of guest
3265920	3271040	spots. We don't get nearly as much insight into how Donna handles the breakup, since the show
3271040	3276080	focuses on Eric. But it's interesting that both of them turn to his parents for help getting
3276080	3280160	through it, and the comfort they offer in some ways reinforces the idea of a happy ending in the
3280160	3284880	future, that one day they'll find someone they won't break up with. They both try dating other
3284880	3290000	people, with Donna dating Kelso's brother Casey, played by Luke Wilson. And Eric dates a few other
3290000	3295120	girls, sometimes sneaking off with Red's new Corvette to attract them. None of these girls
3295120	3300080	last long, and while Donna continues to date Kelso, Eric realizes he's still in love with her.
3300080	3306720	And now, Donna, all of a sudden, it's like the day after we broke up. All over again.
3306720	3311360	Casey is revealed to just be toying with Donna, leaving her heartbroken. So she runs off to
3311360	3316560	California to be with Midge at the end of season 4. In the season 5 premiere, Eric goes to California
3316560	3324880	to get her back. I love you. And I have so much to say, but I just... And a few episodes later,
3324880	3330480	Eric and Donna get engaged. And the rest of season 5 largely see these two trying to win
3330480	3335440	approval from everybody else for their decision to get married in their final year of high school.
3335440	3340720	It's a very strange series of events when, in the space of roughly half a year, we go from
3340720	3345680	Donna and Eric breaking up to getting engaged. In terms of real-world time, this played out on
3345680	3350240	television over roughly a year and a half, which seems more reasonable, but the sheer volume of
3350240	3355920	episodes crammed into each show's annual time span creates a real decompression of time. This
3355920	3360080	can be understood as time feeling much longer when you're younger, and your teenage years
3360080	3364880	seeming so grand and important that everything can change in the course of a few days or weeks.
3364880	3369520	And two people can go from not knowing what their future might hold to knowing they'll be together
3369520	3374960	forever over the course of a few months. It also reinforces how quickly Eric and Donna are growing.
3374960	3378880	They manage to gain a lot of maturity in their time apart, and through the process of trying
3378960	3383520	to convince everyone that their engagement is a good idea, we see what feels like the ultimate
3383520	3389120	conclusion of the Eric and Red dynamic. As a disapproving Red throws numerous roadblocks to
3389120	3394080	stop the wedding from happening, Eric refuses to back down, and Red has one final confrontation
3394080	3400480	with him. You're stuck to your guns, and I admire that you're willing to go out on your own.
3400480	3412720	Eric is now a man. And ironically, it wasn't by obeying Red that he got there,
3412720	3417440	but by rebelling against him. And also by emulating him. Because Red Foreman is not
3417440	3423040	a man who backs down, and now, neither is Eric. It's a bit strange how this relationship stopped
3423040	3428560	being about Eric and Donna and gradually became more about Eric and Red. Eric's path to adulthood
3428560	3433120	meant he has to move beyond his father and grow into something better. It's an uplifting message
3433120	3438960	that reveals that Red can be a role model, but can't be a limit on who Eric can be. And Eric manages
3438960	3444800	to make it to adulthood, not losing that sweeter, kinder, gentler side of himself. Donna's dreams
3444800	3449040	of doing more outside of Point Place don't seem to come up as much in these episodes, and she
3449040	3453200	doesn't think the marriage will somehow hinder that. The loss of Eric, her mother, and being
3453200	3458160	messed with Casey has dropped her back into the arms of Eric, holding on to what certainty she
3458160	3463760	can find in life. In some ways, this reflects the limited options of women of the era. If Donna
3463760	3468880	represented this bold new feminist force ready to take on the world, a few bad turns are all it
3468880	3473520	takes to leave her ready to move into a trailer and begin living the domestic life. Although she
3473520	3479600	and Eric plan on going to college together, when Eric's plans change, so do hers and she stays in
3479600	3484160	Point Place. Comparing her and Eric, it seems Eric has the brighter future with the path to happiness
3484160	3488960	he wants right there for him when he's ready to take it. Donna has to compromise for him.
3488960	3493760	But all of this started happening in season 5 is important because that seemed like the season
3493760	3499040	where the show became more cynical and less thoughtful in its depiction of its characters.
3499040	3505120	Season 5, which starts in the summer of 1978, has a strange feel to it. The characters seem to behave
3505120	3511040	in a more exaggerated way. Red has always been mean to all of Eric's friends, Fez included, but
3511040	3516400	he seems nastier to him starting in this season, often drifting into outright racism.
3516400	3521040	Thanks for the help. You seem to have a natural talent for handling luggage.
3522400	3526240	And speaking of comments like that, we'll see characters casually drop in gross stuff
3526240	3530160	like this in random conversations. I'm starting to get into the Asian ladies.
3531760	3534560	I know what you mean. The mystery of the Orient. I'm very sexy.
3535840	3540720	Characters seem to bit flatter too. Eric, for example, started becoming far more nerdy in
3540720	3545280	this season. In season 1, we found out he really enjoyed Star Wars. But in the following three
3545280	3551040	seasons, it never really comes up. But starting in season 5, he's suddenly collecting action
3551040	3555840	figures and getting very upset when Red makes a homophobic comment about Luke Skywalker.
3555840	3560880	Luke Skywalker, this Luke Skywalker, that I'm sick of hearing about that little fruit.
3560880	3571520	Luke Skywalker is not! He and Leia, clearly!
3573680	3578960	Eric was never particularly cool, but he also wasn't so aggressively nerdy. By the way,
3578960	3584480	the future has some bad news for Eric about the Luke and Leia thing. Red becomes increasingly
3584480	3588640	patriotic in this season, even for some reason becoming a Nixon defender.
3588640	3590640	Thank God for the honest ones like Richard Nixon, huh?
3596320	3597120	What did you say?
3598960	3603360	I said that Nixon was framed and Kennedy was a commie?
3605360	3606000	That's right.
3606880	3612160	While Red always had a degree of patriotism in him, this is a far cry from the Red Forman
3612160	3618160	who confronted Gerald Ford about pardoning Nixon. Red's patriotism is now more of a cliche.
3618160	3623280	The biggest change in season 5 though is with Kitty, when she mistakenly thinks she's pregnant
3623280	3626800	but is actually going through menopause. She reveals this in front of her parents,
3626800	3638960	played by Betty White and Tom Poston. This major moment in her life might have led to her character
3638960	3644080	growing beyond motherhood and evolving to someone different. And while we do see some nice moments
3644080	3650160	between her and her parents, what we get far more of in season 5 are a series of bad menopause jokes.
3657280	3662240	Season 5 flattened its characters into cliches, making the dynamics less compelling than they
3662240	3666960	were in earlier seasons. Part of this is that the show's premise is literally trapping them
3666960	3671200	in this decade, meaning these characters are limited in the way they can grow or change.
3671200	3676400	If they have to forever be teens, it doesn't really offer the opportunity to truly become
3676400	3681360	adults. Not every change in season 5 was a bad one though, as it did also include the introduction
3681360	3690960	of Kitty's new dog, Shotzi. Shotzi even joins a very special circle.
3690960	3703920	At the beginning of season 4, Hyde is back living with the Four Men's.
3720960	3738800	When Jackie pressures Kelso to get married, he runs away to California with Donna,
3738800	3742640	finally ending his relationship with Jackie for good. With Kelso gone,
3742640	3746080	Jackie goes into season 5 in a very different direction.
3751200	3757760	This comes out of nowhere in the series, but there were a few hints leading up to this moment.
3757760	3760880	As you saw earlier, Hyde took the fall for Jackie's pop possession,
3760880	3765600	and between one of Jackie and Kelso's breakup, Hyde realizes he might have some feelings for her.
3781920	3784160	But it doesn't get too much further than a kiss.
3784960	3788880	A season and a half later, the two of them are exploring those old feelings for real.
3788880	3793600	Although a new development, the spark for their relationship isn't terribly inspired.
3793600	3812320	But it does offer a few nice moments that speak to their history,
3812320	3816720	like Jackie taking the fall for Hyde's pop possession. But when Jackie reveals she still
3816720	3820720	has some kind of attachment to Kelso, it puts a strain on her relationship with Hyde.
3824080	3831040	Although they smooth things over, Hyde's concerns get the better of him when he thinks
3831040	3835520	he's caught Jackie and Kelso being intimate when she was really comforting him after Fez
3835520	3840160	had an erotic dream about Kelso. Hyde responds by cheating on Jackie.
3840160	3844240	When the truth comes out, Hyde is left apologizing, and Jackie breaks things off.
3853680	3856000	They get back together early in season six.
3867120	3872160	If you note that when Jackie and Hyde got together, it was the summer of 1978. And now
3872160	3877760	looking at Donna and Jackie enjoying an afternoon run at the pool, it's still the summer of 1978.
3877760	3881360	Not literally, of course. The show has actually gone through an entire season where the gang
3881360	3885920	finished their final year of high school. Yet, for some reason, the license plate still reads
3885920	3891200	1978. The kids of the show are trapped in the 70s and trapped in the show's cyclical storylines,
3891200	3895120	in a sense making a commentary about how shows like these are limited. Instead of its characters
3895120	3900080	growing over time, they're stuck. Even a show that was primarily designed to be driven by its
3900080	3906080	characters is eventually trapped by its premise. Season 5's trip to California had that 70s show
3906080	3911600	trap its characters in its own version of Hotel California, which, by the way, was originally
3911600	3918080	recorded in 1976, the first year covered in that 70s show. While Hyde continuously tries to escape
3918080	3923200	his circumstances, constantly getting pulled back into where he was before, Jackie's struggle is
3923200	3928800	a bit sadder. She only seems to ever be defined by who she is or who she isn't dating. While her
3928800	3934000	character is very much the vehicle for discussing relationships early on, particularly for Donna,
3934000	3937840	who needs someone to help her make sense of her feelings for Eric, Jackie doesn't get a chance
3937840	3943760	to be much more than the relationship character. Jackie is very much carried by Mila Kunis'
3943760	3948960	performances, who manages to make the character both lovable and obnoxious in near-equal measures.
3948960	3952560	She's a great part of the series, but the series doesn't do well enough to give her more varied
3952560	3957600	things to do. One change I haven't mentioned yet is that Tommy Chong joined the principal cast in
3957600	3981520	season 4 but left the show in season 5. The reason Chong left the show is because he was arrested
3981520	3987440	for selling 7,500 bongs through a company he partially owned. He had to pay a fine of
3987440	3992480	$20,000 and was sentenced to 9 months in prison, but he would eventually return to the show once
3992480	3996640	he had been let out. Another change we have to talk about is one that had built building for the
3996640	4003440	last few seasons. Fez was starting to get really weird. As the last in the gang to lose his virginity,
4003440	4007680	one of the running gags for Fez was how his perpetual quest to hook up with someone never
4007680	4012160	seemed to work out. His dating life is a series of amusing fails, with my personal favorite being
4012160	4017600	Caroline, who he briefly dated in season 3. Caroline is not quite as sweet as she first appears.
4042320	4046640	As you might have guessed, they break up. When Fez isn't failing in the dating world,
4046640	4050160	he is making numerous jokes about how horny he is. And the more he jokes,
4050160	4052880	the more the bar gets raised where what counts as creepy.
4072160	4079520	Fez starts off as a little weird, but as the audience gets used to him, he has to say or do
4079520	4084240	something strange to remind everyone that he's not like everyone else, raising the bar for what
4084240	4089760	counts as weird. As the cycle repeats, the bar keeps getting raised, but at this point it isn't
4089760	4095360	as shocking because Fez has been building to this level for years. Fez also seems less like he's
4095360	4101440	from a real place anymore. In the early seasons whenever he speaks his native language, he defaults
4101440	4125120	to speaking Spanish. But now we're getting jokes like this. Fez seems more like a cartoon
4125120	4129520	character than an actual foreign exchange student. Fez's transformations is one of
4129520	4134000	the only ones that felt gradual in season 5 though. Even if the other characters all have some
4134000	4139040	degree of backstory, they still seem noticeably different as the show keeps them frozen in this
4139040	4143280	70s moment, while using a heavy hand to keep this impression that things are still fresh.
4143280	4148720	But Fez was frozen very early on in the series as the series struggled to give him any lasting
4148720	4155440	changes to his character. He was just weird, and he kept getting weirder and, as a consequence,
4155440	4161840	creepier. As season 5 moves along, Lori makes her surprise return. And as Fez is under threat of
4161840	4172960	deportation, having graduated high school, Lori does something drastic. In the season 6 premiere,
4172960	4177840	the kids are alright, we found out that Lori's newly turned over leaf of being a better person
4177840	4182480	immediately turns back over and she returns to being horrible, leaving Fez to be her husband
4182640	4195440	in name only as she dates around. And that's about it. We don't get much more out of this plotline,
4195440	4201360	and Fez continues to putter along. One of the recurring themes for 1978 is how the characters
4201360	4206560	have become frozen. If the previous two years were about discovering a new world, stepping out into it,
4206560	4210960	and then saying maybe that wasn't such a great idea and heading back the way they came,
4210960	4216720	this year was very much about being frozen in place, deciding that where the show needs to be
4216720	4223200	is not in the brave new world of adulthood, but frozen in time in the waning years of the gang's
4223200	4227600	teenage life. This is part of what makes it difficult for sitcoms to maintain an audience
4227600	4232880	over time. One of the remaining draws is the original situation in the Situation Comedy.
4232880	4237360	That 70s show was always meant to be character driven, which usually helps a sitcom overcome
4237360	4241760	that hurdle. But when those characters aren't allowed to grow, it means they can't drive the
4241760	4247440	series the way they were intended to. Because moving forward requires characters to grow,
4247440	4252240	and that 70s show's very premise means these characters have to stay locked in their teenage
4252240	4256960	years. Five years into the show should mean that Eric and Donna have gone off to college and be
4256960	4261520	halfway through it, but they're still only just graduating high school. Hyde should be striking
4261520	4265920	out on his own, but he's still learning lessons on growing up from the foreman's. Jackie should
4265920	4271440	be beyond her high school crushes, but she still hasn't even graduated yet. And Fez should be more
4271440	4276480	than this strange foreign exchange student, but none of his arcs ever amount to more than half a
4276480	4281920	season of antics. What this show does do well, though, is preserve the memory of who these people
4281920	4286960	should be. Much in the way it's looked back at the 1970s is preserving the memory of what that
4286960	4291680	decade was in the minds of certain people who experienced it. Maybe that's why this show had
4291680	4295520	such solid radiance around most of its run, because it was always about holding onto that
4295520	4299840	nostalgic moment, where you can hang out with your friends from high school and never worry
4299840	4304560	about them growing up and becoming completely different people. If sitcoms are comfort food,
4304560	4313680	maybe that's the way that 70s show is best memorialized. One of the hallmarks of that 70s
4313680	4318400	show was its frequent use of fantasy cutaways. That included parodies of pop culture from the
4318400	4323520	decade. There were some visual quirks that predated these parodies, though, with season one using
4323520	4327680	tableaus of famous works of art such as The Last Supper and Night Hawks. But it was the Star Wars
4327680	4332160	themed episode, A New Hope, that put characters in special costumes and sets, and really got the
4332160	4337040	parody ball rolling. From there on, there were dozens of other parodies, from I Love Lucy to
4337040	4342160	Charlie's Angels. I Love Lucy is obviously from the 1950s, not the 70s, but it worked because it
4342160	4346560	was something these characters were familiar with. And it was a necessity because, as the series
4346560	4351040	moved along, parodies from the 70s were harder to come by. It would be tough to include every
4351040	4356400	single parody, so here are my top three. The soap opera parody in season two's Van Stock episode
4356400	4363280	was an instant classic for me. I am leaving you for Dr. Cloak. Or should I say...
4365440	4367280	Eric's real father.
4367280	4381360	He has a job. What do you have, Red Forman? What do you have?
4382960	4387840	After Red discovers the gang is smoking up, we get a great Reefer Madness parody in the season
4387840	4393680	three episode titled Reefer Madness. You've been, you missed choir practice. Sorry dollface, but now,
4394240	4396720	thanks to marijuana, I'm incurably insane.
4400880	4406400	And the Happy Days parody in Jackie Says Cheese is double fun because it also makes a sly reference
4406400	4410480	to jumping the shark. Fez, you jumped that shark and you're not even wet!
4410480	4426480	One of the biggest changes in 1979 was Hyde learning that his father isn't the man he thought
4426480	4430560	he was. At the start of season seven in the episode, Let's Spend the Night Together,
4430560	4436320	we finally meet Hyde's father, William Barnett, often turned to WB, played by Tim Reed.
4437040	4445760	At first, everyone is a bit unsure of how to talk to a black man.
4445760	4469440	Considering this is a small town in Wisconsin in 1979, it makes some sense
4469440	4474320	that no one on the show knows how to talk to a black person, as the town is almost certainly
4474320	4477520	mostly white. But Hyde does take an immediate shine to his new father.
4493040	4496720	Although there's a little friction at first, the two eventually start forging a relationship,
4496720	4501680	with Hyde working at one of the record stores his father owns. The introduction of WB introduces a
4501680	4506480	new dynamic to the mostly white show, though only insofar as we get a lot of jokes like this.
4512240	4516560	Hyde also meets his half-sister Angie, played by Megalyn Etchikunwoke.
4516560	4520160	It is interesting to see the introduction of a black family that's not only wealthy,
4520160	4524880	but so wealthy they're on a higher class level than any of the white characters. The impact of
4524880	4529440	race on these characters doesn't really come up though aside from the many jokes about how they
4529440	4534880	are, in fact, black. Though that might reflect how wealth offers some degree of protection from
4534880	4539120	more common types of bigotry, none of the black characters are a big enough part of the series to
4539120	4543920	really explore that issue though. What this means for Hyde is that he once again has a new father
4543920	4548240	figure. His fourth of the series, it's not too difficult to parse that the show is telling us
4548240	4552800	what a troubled young man needs, is a father giving him some kind of guidance and structure,
4552800	4557920	a lesson so important it's repeated four times. Five if you count Eric in red. And with Tommy
4557920	4561360	Chong out of jail, the show brings back another father figure for good measure.
4568960	4575040	In season seven we see Hyde and Jackie once again back together, only to break up once more. Then
4575040	4580720	get back together again. And then break up one last time. That last breakup is particularly
4580720	4586560	galling as it happens with Hyde walking in on Jackie and Kelso, again, mistakenly thinking they
4586560	4591600	slept together. This moment reinforces how cyclical the narratives on this show can get as
4591600	4596080	they're trapped in this decade repeating the same mistakes over and over as their show gets
4596080	4600560	extended long beyond its expiration date because of its need to make a profit for its corporate
4600560	4606160	overlords. Or at least that's how I suspect Hyde would phrase it. In season eight we find out Hyde
4606160	4611840	is permanently moved on from Jackie and married a stripper he met in Las Vegas. His new wife Samantha
4611840	4617600	is played by Jude Tyler. The marriage doesn't last when Hyde finds out his new wife already has
4617600	4623200	a husband. Heading into 1979, Kelso was making some major strides towards growing up. He had
4623200	4627200	decided on the career path of becoming a police officer. I'm gonna be a cop!
4635360	4639760	Not too long after, when Kelso was trying to convince everyone he hooked up with Donna's
4639760	4644560	friend Brooke, played by Shannon Elizabeth, the truth comes out in an unexpected way.
4652240	4656160	Although Brooke tells Kelso he doesn't have to be involved with the baby since she doesn't see
4656160	4660160	him as father material, Kelso eventually decides he wants to be a part of the life of his child
4660160	4665120	when they're born. Brooke's mother, played by Morgan Bearchild, plans on taking Brooke to Chicago
4665120	4684720	to raise the child. When the baby is born, she's named Betsy. And eventually Kelso decides he can't
4684720	4689760	stand to be away from his daughter, and after the police fire him, he moves to Chicago. Kelso's
4689760	4694400	maturing is difficult to pin down. If having a career wasn't the path to adulthood for him,
4694400	4698560	but being a father was, it does suggest the value of family over one's career. Though the
4698560	4703360	idea of Kelso being a cop is more a nightmare scenario than a standard career path. Kelso's
4703360	4707840	departure was more likely triggered by Ashton Kutcher deciding to leave the series after its
4707840	4711520	seventh season, although he would make a few guest appearances in season eight to give his
4711520	4717440	character a proper send-off. And Kelso leaves point place for good. Well, I guess it's time to go,
4718320	4720480	so, see ya.
4723200	4728640	After his marriage to Laurie, Fez finally becomes an American citizen. He would go from working at
4728640	4735120	the DMV to getting a job as a shampoo boy at a salon, and of course being increasingly weird and
4735120	4747360	creepy. And this is the stuff he talks about when he's not hiding in Donna's club.
4748000	4752880	Yeah, it's starting to get really weird with Fez. Jackie's life gets complicated after her
4752880	4757440	father goes to prison, and Jackie is left to fend for herself. This eventually leads to her and Fez
4757440	4761520	moving in together. For a brief moment, it seemed as though Jackie would have a story arc that wasn't
4761520	4766800	about her dating life when she starts working in television for local TV star Christine St. George,
4766800	4776560	played by Mary Tyler Moore. But the job doesn't last, and eventually Jackie's story intersects
4776560	4791040	with Fez for yet another romance. There are better reasons not to date Fez, mostly because
4791040	4795360	he has no boundaries in impressing himself upon women. But one of the strange quirks about Fez's
4795360	4799920	gradual change over the years is that it simply gets put in the bucket of him being odd. It was
4799920	4803920	his character trait at the beginning of the series, and even though it's elevated dramatically,
4803920	4808400	to the point where he's creeping around in the closet of his friend, he's still covered by the
4808400	4813440	odd foreigner label, and it's the second part of that Jackie has trouble with. Or at least she does
4813440	4818080	for a little while until she gets over it and decides to pursue Fez in earnest, heading toward
4818080	4823040	the show's finale. In the final year of the show, Kitty's journey through menopause finished,
4823040	4827920	and she went on another journey into heavy drinking. It's a far cry from the woman who
4827920	4833040	once struggled with her need to nurture and how it led her to nursing. Post-menopause, most jokes
4833040	4847520	from Kitty were about her drinking problem. Kitty going from being the mother who brings
4847520	4852160	her kids cookies and cocoa to the one who spends most of her time mixing drinks for herself would
4852160	4856960	be an incredibly sad character arc on most other shows, but it's played with some levity here.
4856960	4860800	It does raise the question of what menopause did to Kitty's psyche,
4860800	4865680	but that's never really explored on the show. Kitty's menopause and drinking reveal how tragedy
4865680	4870080	is molded through the candy colors of a sitcom to make things seem brighter, and maybe they're
4870080	4875280	doing the same thing with the whole decade of the 1970s. That could be why people love this show so
4875280	4880000	much. It lets you smile through tragedy. It's good for coping. If it was too real, it would be too
4880000	4885280	heartbreaking. If it wasn't real enough, it wouldn't resonate. The balance is key. In earlier seasons,
4885280	4889840	I think the show did a better job of that, but even in later ones, it does attempt to strike
4889840	4894720	some kind of balance. Red manages to find some new ventures when he stops working at Price Mart
4894720	4899360	and ends up opening a muffler shop. You might wonder where Red got the money for a muffler shop,
4899360	4910080	but he was creative with that. Red struggles to keep the shop open when a rival store from a big
4910080	4915920	chain opens up nearby, but luckily for him, they make an offer and Red decides to sell the muffler
4915920	4931120	shop. So now Red has enough money to retire. What might have been some bad luck hitting Red
4931120	4935920	once again ends up in his favor since he's the guy who owned the muffler shop and not just someone
4935920	4940560	who worked there. Although Bob wasn't quite so fortunate in previous seasons, Red does show at
4940560	4945440	once odds improve if you can position yourself as the business owner than its worker. Although
4945440	4951360	looking at this in totality, it really seems like business is something of a crop shoot. Maybe
4951360	4955200	you'll succeed, maybe you won't. It all depends on whether or not big businesses come in and
4955200	4960320	stomp you out of business or decide to buy you off. Although there is one consistent that remains
4960320	4964880	true for all business ventures on this show, the only way Red could get into this position is that
4964880	4969280	he had to sell out his own son's future. It certainly says something that all the major
4969280	4974320	business successes on this show involve screwing over another person. The Eric and Donna saga
4974320	4979360	continued with the wedding at the end of season 6 being called off when Eric got scared and ran
4979360	4983440	away before it could happen, in part because he realized the wedding was keeping Donna from
4983440	4988080	pursuing her dreams since she chose to stay in point place to be with him instead of going to
4988080	4994400	college. The pair spend season 7 together unsure of how their life will move forward. Donna decides
4994400	4999120	to dye her hair. The real reason for Laura Prepon doing this was because she needed to be blonde for
4999120	5003920	an upcoming movie she was starring in called Carla. Eric spends most of season 7 trying to
5003920	5008400	figure out what to do with his life before finally settling on becoming a teacher. Since
5008400	5013040	Red spent all of Eric's college money on the muffler shop, Eric needs to find some other way
5013040	5017760	of paying for college, and he comes up with an unorthodox solution. There's this program where
5017760	5022960	you go and teach an impoverished area for a year and then they pay for your college. I signed up.
5023520	5027520	That's wonderful. So where then? Africa.
5027520	5032800	Africa, Wisconsin?
5032800	5037280	Eric will be spending next year teaching in Africa. We don't know where exactly,
5037280	5042000	and the show never quite goes into detail. We only know it's somewhere in the second biggest
5042000	5046960	continent on the planet. I need these shots. Africa is very strict about these things,
5046960	5050720	and they're not strict about anything. I mean, the women walk around with their hooves hanging
5050720	5055440	on. There's something that needs to be addressed that occurs constantly throughout this series,
5055440	5060240	particularly in the later seasons. Characters are increasingly ignorant or sometimes outright
5060240	5065040	disrespectful and racist towards any culture outside of their Midwest bubble. This is excused
5065040	5070240	by the context of the series, since it's just assumed that people in the 1970s were more likely
5070240	5075760	to be culturally insensitive. While that may be true, that 70s show in its inception seemed to
5075760	5080400	want to be a little more enlightened than that. For example, Fez being welcomed into the gang of
5080400	5084560	friends was a gesture of kindness that was at odds with more ignorant characters such as Red,
5084560	5088400	and while they often didn't understand his cultural references, as his oddness perhaps
5088400	5092880	became too central a point of his character, there was a genuine attempt to not just make him a
5092880	5097440	walking collection of stereotypes. Similarly, when the first season introduced gay characters,
5097440	5101840	they resisted being tired cliches or harmful stereotypes, and the characters around them are
5101840	5106640	far more accepting than one might expect from a group of straight teens in the 1970s. But by
5106640	5111360	season 7, some of that care had faded away, and in the interest of letting us, the audience,
5111360	5115920	laugh at the racism of the past in the presumed comfort that it doesn't exist in the present.
5115920	5121040	Something that certainly isn't true, and breeds a degree of complacency towards racial issues.
5121040	5125680	When the show has its fun making fun of Africa in a broad context, it's nudging the audience with
5125680	5130560	a knowing wink saying, isn't it great people aren't this ignorant anymore? When the truth is,
5130560	5134400	a lot of people would struggle to come up with the name of African countries where Eric might
5134400	5140160	be headed to. On the flip side, the ready acceptance of Hyde's new black family is lovely to see,
5140160	5145280	even if, in the case of characters like Jackie, it's motivated by greed. So, like many things in
5145280	5149840	the later seasons of the series, there is a generous mix of good and bad that complicates
5149840	5155440	characters that, ironically, behave very simply. It's an uneven tone that speaks to the strange
5155440	5160720	lens sitcoms use to make the word simpler, yet complex enough to be convincing. At least for a
5160720	5166240	couple of laughs. As Eric prepares to head out to somewhere in Africa, he waves goodbye and is on
5166240	5176640	his way east, across the Atlantic. The real reason Eric has to leave the show is because
5176640	5181760	Topher Grace had been looking to go beyond the series and would soon be appearing in movies.
5181760	5186560	To replace him, the character of Charlie Richardson, played by Brett Harrison, was introduced.
5186560	5190080	And when Harrison was offered the lead in his own show, The Loop,
5190080	5192800	he was quickly killed off at the beginning of season 8.
5193120	5205440	To replace him, the character Randy Pearson, played by Josh Myers, was introduced.
5212640	5214800	When Eric breaks up with Donna over a letter,
5214800	5220880	Randy becomes her love interest through some of season 8. The fan reaction to Randy was not great,
5220880	5225360	and while Randy's presence wasn't the sole reason, ratings for season 8 were on a steady
5225360	5230240	decline. Without Eric and Kelso, that 70's show just didn't have the magic it once had.
5230240	5234240	It was then that the network decided to cancel it, with its final two episodes airing together,
5234240	5240400	Love of My Life and That 70's Finale, ended the decade for good on May 18th, 2006.
5240960	5244400	In the penultimate episode of the series, characters are quickly moved into place for
5244400	5249200	the finale, so they can finally escape the 70's. Hyde is given a record store by his father.
5251520	5254000	Yes, you're the proud owner of the last remaining grooves.
5257120	5258960	Holy crap, I own this place?
5258960	5260480	Jackie and Fez get together.
5268160	5271520	And we find out that Eric is coming back to point place.
5281840	5283440	Yeah, you're not going anywhere.
5283440	5288240	The final episode of the series takes place, as you might expect, on New Year's Eve,
5288240	5293840	1979. But the surprise return we get isn't Eric. Rather, it's Kelso.
5293840	5296240	There you guys are. Kelso!
5296240	5297520	Hey man, why don't you get back?
5298800	5301760	Man, come on, I'm not gonna spend New Year's without my friends.
5302560	5305360	Come on! It's like, the turn of the century!
5306160	5310000	As everyone celebrates the coming New Year inside, Donna waits outdoors,
5310000	5314160	before finding out that Eric was coming back, she had already made a remind to finally go to
5314160	5319280	college. But with him returning, she can't bring herself to get on that bus out of town
5319280	5321760	just yet. Not without seeing him first.
5321760	5326000	And as she reminisces about all the time they spent together, Eric returns.
5327200	5327920	Happy New Year.
5331360	5332320	Eric.
5332320	5333040	Red was right.
5336160	5337120	I am a dumbass.
5340640	5341140	Donna.
5343600	5344160	I'm sorry.
5347600	5351040	And we end the series with one final circle.
5351920	5353920	Did you guys hear about that car that runs on water?
5354800	5358400	It's got a fiberglass air-cooled engine and it runs on water, man!
5360800	5363680	It's like we never run out of things to talk about down there.
5363680	5366560	And we count down the end of 1979.
5366800	5369680	Three, two, one!
5372000	5375520	Eric going away made his relationship with Donna so much more meaningful.
5375520	5379920	They both understood what they were missing in a way that a breakup doesn't quite match when
5379920	5384800	they see each other all the time. And it's that old saying of, if you love something, set it free.
5384800	5387360	If it returns, it was meant to be.
5387360	5391840	As the show sends everyone away for the new decade, it seems to be telling the audience that
5391840	5395760	everyone is gonna be okay. They'll all be fine no matter what might lay ahead.
5395840	5400080	One touch I really liked was that the ending credits of the series are the same as the first
5400080	5406080	episode of the series. The gang is singing Tom Rungren's Hello It's Me. At the end of the pilot,
5406080	5410720	seeing this was an endearing introduction to these teenagers making their way through a decade
5410720	5416000	that was only vaguely familiar to me. But here at the end of the series, it's nostalgia for the
5416000	5421520	beginning of a show that was built on nostalgia. That 70 show is about these kids driving down the
5421520	5426640	street, taking their first step into the big new world. But this show isn't about that journey in
5426640	5431760	the new world. It's about being in that moment on the cusp of that journey. It's why everyone in the
5431760	5437200	series is trapped in high school, in their teen years, in the 70s. It's a memory of that moment
5437200	5441600	that stretches for as long as the series can hold on to it, when you felt like the world was going
5441600	5446880	to be something new and exciting. While it didn't always have the best grasp of its premise, it did
5446880	5452080	have a firm hold on that feeling it wanted to evoke. And those final lyrics we hear from Hello
5452080	5458800	It's Me sound even clearer. It's important to me that you know you are free, because I never want
5458800	5460160	to make you change for me.
5460160	5477760	The success of that 70 show spawned a spin-off a few years later. Although a lot of the same
5477760	5482000	creative talent was responsible for the show behind the scenes, that didn't manifest itself
5482000	5489120	into another hit. That 80s show debuted on January 23rd, 2002, to a warm response initially,
5489120	5493920	but quickly sank in the ratings throughout its first season. It was quickly cancelled after 13
5493920	5499440	episodes. There are a number of reasons cited for why the show failed, leaning a bit too hard on
5499440	5504880	gags about the decade instead of having characters drive the series. Also, people had less nostalgia
5504880	5509840	for the 80s than they did the 70s, and the cast didn't quite have the same chemistry as the ones
5509840	5515280	on that 70s show. Watching it again 20 years later, I personally didn't think it was as bad as I
5515280	5520000	remembered it being, but it definitely doesn't have the magic of the original series it spun
5520000	5525120	off of. One interesting bit of trivia about the series is that it stars a young Glenn Howerton
5525120	5530160	who would go on to play Dennis in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. It's rumored his character,
5530160	5536000	Corey Howard, supposedly was Eric Borman's first cousin, but this never actually comes up in the
5536000	5547920	series itself. On February 12, 1999, another That 70s Show program aired in England, under the name
5547920	5554560	Days Like These. This is a nearly identical remake of the American series, except subtly changed to
5554560	5559920	move the show from Point Place, Wisconsin to Blutton, England. The scripts were kept nearly
5559920	5565040	identical aside from a few cultural references being changed. Only the British cast didn't quite
5565040	5569520	perform it with the same energy as the American one. Here's an example of two scenes and how they
5569520	5570800	played out in each show.
5595040	5615840	It's not quite the same, is it? British audiences weren't very impressed and the show only aired
5615840	5626800	at 10 of the 13 episodes produced. In October of 2021, Netflix announced they were producing
5626800	5631920	a new spin-off of That 70s Show titled That 90s Show. It would bring Kurtwood Smith and Deborah
5631920	5636800	Joe Rupp in their roles as Red and Kimmy Borman back. The premise of the series was that Eric
5636800	5642480	and Donna's daughter Leah was spending the summer of 1995 in Point Place. Aside from Smith and Rupp,
5642480	5648960	the rest of the cast is made up of Callie Heverda, Ashley Afterhide, Miss Coronel, Maxwell A.C.
5648960	5654960	Donovan, Rainn Doy, and Sam Morales. Other original cast members slated to appear are
5654960	5660800	Topher Grace, Laura Prepon, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama. Although, as of
5660800	5665440	the time of writing this, it seems they'll only be making guest appearances. Running for 10 episodes
5665440	5670240	and shot in the multi-camera style of the original, it's already been filmed and is currently waiting
5670320	5680160	for its premiere date on Netflix. Topher Grace left That 70s Show to star in Spider-Man 3 as
5680160	5684880	Eddie Brock slash Venom. He would go on to star in a number of other movies as well, including
5684880	5690800	In Good Company and Win a Date with Tad Hamilton. Most recently, he's been a part of the TV series
5690800	5696720	Home Economics. Laura Prepon would appear in several TV and film projects following the end
5696720	5701440	of That 70s Show, most notably as the character Alex Vance in the Netflix series Orange is the
5701440	5705520	New Black. Most recently, she and her husband celebrated the birth of their second child in
5705520	5711360	February of 2020. Mila Kunis has been featured in several projects following the end of That 70s
5711360	5717760	Show, including Black Swan, Bad Moms, and Voice in the Character Meg in nearly 400 episodes of Family
5717760	5722720	Guy. In 2012, she began dating her former co-star, Ashton Kutcher, and the two would eventually
5722720	5729120	marry in 2015. They currently have two children together. Ashton Kutcher starred in a number of
5729120	5734240	movies and TV shows, notably No Strings Attached, What Happened in Vegas, and he replaced Charlie
5734240	5739520	Sheen on Two and a Half Men. He's most recently starred in The Branch on Netflix, which ran for
5739520	5744560	four seasons, split into eight parts. In his personal side, in addition to marrying Mila Kunis
5744560	5750080	and having two children, he's also in the process of treatment for a recent diagnosis of vasculitis.
5750640	5755520	Wilma Roald Rama went on to appear on several TV shows and movies following the end of That 70s
5755520	5761440	Show, perhaps most notably as the character Nick Torres on NCIS. He's also currently cast as Don
5761440	5767360	Diego de la Vega, better known as Zorro in an upcoming Zorro TV series. Kurtwood Smith would
5767360	5772320	continue his very prolific acting career with appearances on 24, Agent Carter, and doing voice
5772320	5776560	work on a number of different animated projects. Although it was a role he had before That 70s
5776560	5780720	Show, I personally remember him most fondly for his role in the Star Trek Voyager two-parter,
5780720	5785520	Year of Hell. Deborah Jo Rupp has been working both on screen and on stage, including several
5785520	5790240	productions on Broadway. One of her most recent high-profile roles was on the WandaVision series.
5790240	5794800	She was also nominated for a Drama Desk Award for her portrayal of Dr. Ruth in the stage
5794800	5800240	production Becoming Dr. Ruth. Don Stark has been consistently working since the end of That 70s
5800240	5803920	Show, often with guest spots on a number of different TV programs. He also had several
5803920	5809600	reoccurring roles on Hit the Floor and Marin. Tanya Roberts had largely stepped away from
5809600	5813680	the world of acting following her departure from That 70s Show to take care of her husband,
5813680	5821280	her final roles in 2005 in the TV series Barbershop. Sadly, on January 4, 2021, she passed away due to
5821280	5826640	complications from an advanced case of sepsis. Lisa Robin Kelly left the world of acting after
5826640	5832560	That 70s Show, only to briefly reappear in two shorts. She had a series of high-profile arrests
5832560	5837120	related to substance abuse and domestic violence. She passed away on January 3,
5837120	5843040	2014, while in rehab, and her cause of death is reported as multiple drug intoxication.
5843040	5848400	Tommy Chong has been working regularly since the end of That 70s Show, including a reunion with his
5848400	5854640	longtime partner, Cheech Marin, to revive their classic stoner duo of Cheech and Chong. In 2012,
5854640	5859280	he announced that he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and was receiving treatment. As of 2019,
5859280	5865440	he announced that he is currently cancer-free. In 2017, Danny Masterson had three separate
5865440	5871680	allegations of sexual assault filed against him, and on June 17, 2020, he was charged with three
5871680	5876960	separate instances of rape. He is currently scheduled to be criminally tried on October 11,
5876960	5881920	2022. This is the part of the retrospective where I give you all some parting thoughts
5881920	5887120	to close this off, hopefully fostering some understanding of the good and bad of a classic
5887120	5891600	series. Maybe one you might want to go watch yourself and come up with your own reading for,
5891600	5896480	or maybe one you'd just be happy knowing a little more about. I want to try something a little
5896480	5902080	different, though, with this one. While working on this video, one problem I could not solve was
5902080	5907920	how to talk about Danny Masterson. Unlike Roseanne Barr or Bill Cosby, Masterson was not the driving
5907920	5913200	force behind this production. His alleged sexual assault happened in his personal life and seemingly
5913200	5918480	didn't impact the production of the series. But even so, if you believe the women who have accused
5918480	5922640	him, and I am inclined to do that, it makes it difficult to watch without that knowledge
5922640	5927760	constantly floating around in your mind. While researching this video, I also learned one of the
5927760	5933840	women who accused him, Chrissy Carnell Bixler, appeared in an episode of the series. What seems
5933840	5938720	to be just a fun little throwaway line in an episode takes on a different tone when you
5938720	5942880	understand the context behind it. There's also the claims that Masterson is being protected by
5942880	5947840	the Church of Scientology, which is such a messy and complicated claim that I can't possibly do
5947840	5952720	it justice in this video. There's lots of other resources, I'll link a few below if you'd like
5952720	5958240	to learn more about this case. It raises important questions, like do the actions of this one man
5958240	5964640	wipe out an entire series? That 70s show wouldn't be the same without Hyde, but it wasn't exactly
5964640	5969520	his show. And the work of all those people being forgotten because of the actions of one man seems
5969520	5973840	unfair. If you're someone who wants to enjoy the show in spite of knowing what's been alleged
5973840	5979840	against Masterson, I think that's okay. But for some people, that just isn't possible. They can't
5979840	5985120	watch this series without that knowledge tainting it and in some way undermining the experience,
5985120	5990240	and I think that's okay too. People are allowed to have complicated relationships with art,
5990240	5996000	and you're allowed to take what you want, or skip the process entirely if you don't want to deal
5996000	6001280	with it at all. Regardless of how you feel about that 70s show, though, I do think what is very
6001280	6007040	important is that all claims of sexual assault should be taken seriously and thoroughly investigated.
6007040	6011920	Ultimately, I think that's far more important than whether or not you can sit down and enjoy
6011920	6017600	a sitcom without feeling guilty about it. That 70s show can decolored nostalgia, holding onto
6017600	6022640	that naive optimism of your waning teen years. It's a show that helps you remember the good parts
6022640	6028000	of the past while forgetting the bad. Just remember to keep one foot in reality, and get
6028000	6036960	ready to face it again when you're ready to leave the circle. The ending to this retrospective is
6036960	6042640	making me think there is a video that will one day need to be made about how to engage with art
6042640	6049200	that was, at least in part, created by people who have done harmful and sometimes heinous things
6049200	6055600	behind the scenes. Speaking of values, though, if you think this video had any sort of value,
6055600	6060320	do consider becoming a patron or member like the lovely names you see scrolling up the screen.
6060320	6064640	You'll have early access to videos in the future and a little extra say on what the next sitcom I
6064640	6069120	cover will be, and there are other little bonuses I've thrown along the way. If you would like to

6080960	6086400	the credits, I want to share one of my favorite jokes from that 70s show. This is Red counseling
6086400	6090960	Eric after he accidentally ran over Donna's cat, Mr. Bonkers.
