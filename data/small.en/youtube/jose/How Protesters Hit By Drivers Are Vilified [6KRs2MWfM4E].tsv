0	4880	This video includes discussion of people being hit, and in some cases killed, by cars.
4880	9440	I won't be using any footage or images of people being hit, but some of the discussion
9440	11480	will get intense.
11480	23800	On July 4th, on the I-5 freeway in Seattle, Washington, two Black Lives Matter protesters,
23800	28840	Summer Taylor and Diaz Love, were hit by a car that had driven through their protest.
28840	32480	The collision killed Taylor and left Love with critical injuries.
32480	38120	The driver, DeWitt Kalit, was charged with vehicular homicide, vehicular assault, and
38120	39440	reckless driving.
39440	43640	The I-5 freeway had been shut down by police at the time, as it had over the previous 19
43640	46860	days protests that had also taken place on the freeway.
46860	51140	Police suspect the driver entered the I-5 freeway from an exit ramp along Stewart Street.
51140	55280	He would then have needed to perform a U-turn and driven roughly one quarter of a mile before
55280	57200	reaching the protesters.
57240	62280	As the driver approached the 30 or so protesters, he drove around the two cars set up as barricades
62280	64200	and then hit both Taylor and Love.
64200	67420	The collision occurred at roughly 1.40 am.
67420	70920	After the collision, the driver slowed his car before driving off when several of the
70920	72620	other protesters approached him.
72620	74680	He was later arrested by police.
74680	79120	The driver reportedly was not intoxicated at the time, according to a field test performed
79120	83780	by police, but in court documents it was stated that he was dealing with an untreated addiction
83780	89700	issue involving Percocet, a substance that appears to be crystal meth, and several implements
89700	94140	commonly used to smoke illegal substances were found in his car.
94140	98260	According to police, the driver expressed concern for the well-being of the two people
98260	99260	he hit.
99260	103380	Kalit's lawyer has claimed that there was nothing political about the incident.
103380	107820	With the most charity I can muster, this could be considered an incident of reckless driving,
107820	112860	possibly under the influence of drugs, leading to the death and severe injury of two people.
112860	117180	As someone looking at the evidence, it's difficult to ascribe any specific attempt
117180	118180	to Kalit.
118180	122060	According to the individual who first published video of this incident to Twitter and who
122060	126380	was a witness at the scene, the driver was acting deliberately.
126380	128700	But something else happened after this horrific moment.
128700	133420	The footage of the accident went viral, and an apparatus of conservative spin kicked into
133420	134500	gear.
134500	138900	After the footage of the collision was posted to Twitter, the tweet was spread by Ian Miles
138900	139900	Chong.
139900	143740	He made a series of tweets claiming the protesters were responsible for getting hit.
143740	148140	It is illegal to block an interstate, plain and simple.
148140	152420	Police say that the driver involved in the Seattle I-5 hit is being interviewed and will
152420	156120	likely be charged with aggravated assault and a hit and run.
156120	159820	But the fault is of the protesters for blocking the interstate.
159820	163200	He also went on to spread misinformation about the incident.
163200	167080	The two people who got hit look like they ran back into the path of the car after it
167080	170100	swerved to the left to avoid the other protesters.
170100	171520	Why the hell?
171520	175080	The problem with the protest group, and you can watch the full two-hour livestream, is
175080	179040	that they moved on to the freeway without informing the police about their whereabouts,
179040	183740	so police couldn't properly seal off the area because they received little notice.
183740	187360	Not only were police aware, they had barricaded entrances to the freeway.
187360	192620	These protests on the I-5 had been going on for 19 days, and according to this tweet,
192620	195960	they had closed the highway nearly two hours before the incident.
195960	199860	Ian, like some other people we'll be looking at, is determined to present a version of
199860	205120	events where a driver who sees cars parked on a freeway surrounded by a group of 30 people
205120	210240	has no expectation of even slowing down to a safe speed while passing.
210240	214200	We saw similar takes from our dear friend in a beanie, Tim Pool.
214200	218320	Sad to see anyone lose their life, we need to do better to teach our kids not to hang
218320	222700	out on interstate highways at night while wearing all black around a curve and with
222700	225680	vehicles blocking view of you and your friends.
225680	230800	Hopefully Tim gave us a video to offer some more nuance to his position.
230800	234240	At night, wearing all black.
234240	238880	Several protesters dressed in non-black outfits are clearly visible, and Summer Taylor, seen
238880	242160	right here, is clearly not wearing an all-black outfit.
242160	245920	Also, there are, like, 30 people here.
245920	247160	No lights at night.
247160	249960	There are, of course, lights all over the freeway.
249960	253480	Maybe he means the protesters should have lights, but this is me guessing because all
253480	256360	he ever says is, no lights.
256360	260160	Regardless though, there's clearly enough lights to see the protesters from a distance,
260160	264720	as evidenced by this camera showing us the protesters from a distance.
264720	265720	Think about this.
265720	267160	You're on a highway.
267160	268760	You're coming around a curve.
268760	272520	All of a sudden, before you realize it because it's at night and there's no lights, there's
272520	273960	two vehicles in the middle of the road.
273960	274960	What do you do?
274960	277240	This guy swerved out of the way.
277240	280680	When he swerved onto the shoulder, a ton of people were standing there.
280680	281680	So what did he do?
281680	282680	He swerved to the left.
282680	283680	Pop, pop.
283680	288360	And he hit two people, sending them flying, one of which is now dead.
288360	291120	I can't believe they're charging this guy for this.
291120	295200	The very idea that 30 people were hidden behind two vehicles and that the driver couldn't
295200	300200	have possibly seen these two vehicles blocking off the road until the last second is absurd.
300200	303980	The band Tim goes on about was roughly 600 feet away.
303980	308240	That the highway had been empty for a quarter of a mile should have perhaps tipped him off.
308240	309640	That something was up.
309640	314480	Tim's standard incompetence aside, we get to the real heart of this video later on.
314480	318600	Am I going to blame this guy because he was driving his car on the highway?
318600	319600	That's ridiculous.
319600	324440	If anything, the protesters should be held to some degree criminally, criminally liable
324440	326140	for blocking a highway.
326140	327640	It's a crime.
327640	329120	Why aren't they getting in trouble?
329120	333280	This is, of course, not the first time Tim has lied about footage.
333280	339480	They're yelling, pop his effing tires and you hear them deflating his tires and then
339480	343600	he slowly speeds up and they all start screaming and banging on his, actually, I'm sorry,
343600	345360	they start banging on his vehicle first.
345360	346960	Then he slowly speeds up.
346960	351200	I don't want to say speeding, like he's inching forward and then people start going
351200	352720	yelling.
352720	355600	And then once he's clear of protesters, he just goes and takes off.
355600	356600	That's it.
356600	360720	Tim went on to play the shakiest, least helpful footage he could find, but if you actually
360720	365520	look up the video he cites, you'll see that this part in particular didn't make it into
365520	366520	Tim's video.
366520	374360	That looks a little dangerous to me.
374360	378100	There's also no footage of what happened before the vehicle was stopped by protesters.
378100	383400	So the story, in Tim's mind, only starts when we see the vehicle surrounded by protesters.
383400	389800	How it got there and in what way cannot possibly be inferred because all protesters are liars.
389800	391200	And evil.
391200	399680	Welcome to the modern era, where the activists will obviously lie about everything.
399680	401480	Man evil people, I tell you what.
401480	402880	I should offer a brief correction here.
402880	408440	I used to think Tim was just a fool who had no idea what he was talking about.
408440	411920	My position has evolved and I'll issue a correction right here.
411920	415480	I think he's deliberately misrepresenting the facts here.
415480	420560	He's just not particularly bright in how he goes about it, or at least he has a very serious
420560	424880	contempt for his audience and doesn't think they'll care that he's so transparently
424880	426400	lying to them.
426400	430800	But social media provocateurs are not the only people downplaying vehicular assault.
430800	435120	Tucker Carlson's Daily Wire has previously released a compilation of protesters being
435120	447920	accosted by vehicles, played to the tune of Ludacris's Move, Bitch.
447920	454080	Daily caller writer Blake Neff also published article with his headline and subheader.
454080	458520	Anti-Columbus Day protesters threatened to assault driver get run over.
458520	463480	White man overruns indigenous peoples with superior technology.
463480	468120	Blake Neff, for the curious, was formerly the head writer for Tucker Carlson's Fox
468120	472480	News show, but recently resigned after he was discovered to have participated in an
472480	477080	explicitly racist message board for the last 10 years, often inserting the racist messaging
477080	480140	from that board into scripts for Tucker Carlson.
480140	484000	And of course, I would be remiss not to mention the death of Heather Heyer, who was murdered
484000	488480	at the Charlottesville rally when a car ran into a group of counter-protesters.
488480	493120	This incident was similarly spun by media figures and other assorted internet buffoons.
493120	498760	Here's a brief example of YouTuber Carl Benjamin showing us his intellectual metal.
498760	506640	It looks like what happened is that he was shocked by seeing the car crash happening
506640	511440	and had a heart attack.
511440	518440	I know, I know, it's horrible, but it does seem a very dramatic reaction to a car crash.
518440	522080	It's more than the alt-right being blamed for someone having a heart attack.
522080	525560	Someone in tremendously bad physical condition has heart attack and suddenly the alt-right
525560	527000	has murdered someone.
527000	532320	Mike Brown, a police detective for King County, which Seattle is a part of, posted a meme
532320	537120	to his Facebook after Summer Taylor and Diaz Love were struck by a car.
537120	540880	All lives splatter, keep your ass off the road.
540880	545920	Brown is currently on leave and the family of Summer Taylor has called for his firing.
545920	551440	All this spin, all these distortions are done with the express purpose of changing the narrative.
551440	555680	It wants people to believe that the protesters who are hit by cars are not victims.
555680	560760	That they are either liars and frauds or somehow deserving of any injury or death that
560760	563960	meets them while they are trying to exercise their right to protest.
563960	568840	The reactions commentators like this generate on social media are particularly ghoulish.
568840	572680	Who else here feels sorry for the driver and any damages to their car?
572680	575920	And I honestly don't care if those idiots were removed from the gene pool.
575920	579800	They were in the middle of I-5 at night, the height of stupid.
579800	581520	I call this self-defense.
581520	583040	Why are they blocking the road?
583040	585560	What are they going to do to you if you stop?
585560	587540	This guy didn't want to find out.
587540	591120	No one wants to get ripped from their cars from the mob anymore.
591120	593080	We've had enough.
593080	596080	The effect on the audience, I think, is clear.
596080	601320	Working in tandem with messages describing protesters as violent rioters, particularly
601320	605800	in the context of this story when the only violence expressed towards the driver came
605800	611440	after he had just run over two people, is part of the goals of these anti-protest commentaries.
611440	615880	The idea is to vilify the protesters and their message, and they'll ignore, distort,
615880	619120	and lie about whatever facts they need to do that.
619120	623840	Speaking to the New York Times, Ari E. Weil, the deputy research director at the Chicago
623840	628280	Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago, described this growing culture
628280	631280	of sharing memes about protesters being run over.
631280	633400	It's not just an extremist thing here.
633400	637420	There are social media circles online where people are sharing these and joking about
637420	640740	them because they disagree with the protests and their methods.
640740	644120	Sharing memes and joking about running over people can lead to real danger.
644120	649260	This was echoed by Josh Lepowski, a senior researcher at the Counter Extremism Project.
649260	654180	There has been an increasing amount of propaganda online calling for vehicular attacks on protesters,
654180	656300	targeting the Black Lives Matter movement in particular.
656300	661940	It is being used as a form of intimidation against them to get them to halt their protests.
661940	666580	According to research done by Weil, there have been at least 66 car attacks across the
666580	672580	United States since George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police on May 25th, 2020.
672580	677860	Of those 66, 24 have led to charges being filed, while 4 have been ruled accidents.
677860	682580	Perhaps most disturbingly, 7 of these incidents involved police officers.
682580	686500	Car attacks have become an increasingly common topic in recent years, and in response, some
686500	690620	state legislatures have proposed bills that would protect drivers who unintentionally
690620	692540	harm or kill protesters.
692540	696560	Although there are some Facebook memes to the contrary, so far none of these bills have
696560	698280	actually been passed.
698280	702000	There is an awkward conversation to be had regarding the safety of protesters, whether
702000	706720	it be staying as visible as possible at night or effectively communicating threats to others.
706720	710940	Many protests do have earnest discussions and big precautions to keep people safe, and
710940	715040	I think good natured criticism on how that can be improved should be welcomed.
715040	719340	But a sharp line needs to be drawn between constructive criticism to improve protests
719340	724060	and criticism that's designed to undermine and discredit entire movements.
724060	729560	When people such as Tim Poole or Mike Brown tell people to get off the streets, it isn't
729560	733220	out of concern for the safety of protesters, it's because they want to discredit the
733220	734920	very message behind the movement.
734920	739240	When it comes to the individuals driving cars who crash through these protests, they're
739240	743540	presented as victims of circumstance and not held to nearly the same level of responsibility
743540	745180	of the protesters.
745180	749140	Another thing lost in this discussion is that the safety of the protesters is not the only
749140	750200	issue at play here.
750200	751620	This is also about free expression.
751620	755800	In the week leading up to me writing this script, free expression and cancel culture
755800	760340	came up in the context of people being booted off very large platforms, such as the recent
760340	763720	removal of Stefan Molyneux and Richard Spencer from YouTube.
763720	767900	Every time this happens to a conservative, or in this case, white nationalist, there's
767900	772040	an outcry from the right about how cancel culture is out of control and the left is
772040	776260	constantly attacking the free marketplace of ideas.
776260	780340	The free marketplace of ideas is an incredibly apt name, in that it functions the same way
780340	783140	a free economic market works in society today.
783140	787900	The lack of regulation creates the guise of a lack of bias, ignoring how some people have
787900	792700	been left out of the conversation, and that the playing field is most certainly not even.
792700	797940	Taylor and Love, much like other protesters, were exercising the right of free expression,
797940	801740	but instead of racing to their defense, people who supposedly care about free expression
801740	805980	are bending over backwards to blame them for being hit by a car.
805980	810200	You probably wouldn't even know the names of these two people had one of them not died
810200	812180	and the other been seriously injured.
812180	816380	In much the same way Black Lives Matter only gained traction when thousands of people took
816380	819880	to the streets, demanding the attention of the mainstream media.
819880	823700	The opposition to Black Lives Matter only needs to call up the New York Times to get
823700	828040	some free space in the op-ed section of one of the most prominent outlets in the world
828040	832780	to say it's time to call them the military to bust the heads of these protesters.
832780	837020	That is the disparity between people who have power in the marketplace of ideas and
837020	838260	those who don't.
838260	841620	One side of the argument needs hundreds of thousands of people in the streets, the other
841620	846260	side needs a phone call, and suddenly their message is in front of millions.
846260	849220	Someone who truly cares about free expression should be most concerned about protecting
849220	853540	the expression and sometimes even holding up the expression of those with the least
853540	856700	amount of access to that free marketplace of ideas.
856700	860820	And this access cannot be entangled from the history of oppression that has denied people
860820	862620	access to these spaces.
862620	867140	Today we probably have more female commentators now than any other point in recent history
867140	868740	in the English-speaking world.
868740	872540	In the past, women commenting on important issues would have to write under a man's
872540	875580	name, like George Eliot had to do in the 19th century.
875580	880980	Or if they did openly brush up against serious subjects, they would have to issue weird prefaces
880980	885900	apologizing for daring to talk about workers' rights, which Elizabeth Gaskell had to do
885900	888140	in her novel, Mary Barton.
888140	891860	I know nothing of political economy or the theories of trade.
891860	896740	I have tried to write truthfully, and if my accounts agree or clash with any system,
896740	900100	the agreement or disagreement is unintentional.
900100	904220	Although it should be said that things have improved since the 19th century, things have
904220	909260	not quite reached parity, as seen by any woman who has recently tried to speak out about
909260	913500	video games or some other important issues insecure men have a vested interest in, and
913500	917860	things get dramatically worse for people who are even further marginalized, such as a trans
917860	922540	woman being harassed for daring to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated.
922540	926140	While cancel culture is an interesting debate, it's not a debate that's happening on
926140	927700	even terms.
927700	931340	Conservatives seem chiefly concerned with protecting their own rather than broadening
931340	935940	the free marketplace of ideas to include people who have been historically denied access.
935940	939780	If you don't want to protect protesters from being run over by cars, you don't care
939780	942860	about protecting someone's free expression at all.
942860	947300	Over the past scene of Summer Taylor, their family held a brief press conference.
947300	953180	No matter how much I might want to ask them to stay safe during protests, they would just
953180	962380	say, Mom, if you are black in this country, it isn't even safe to be alive.
962380	965900	And they were right.
965900	972900	So even in death, we want Summer's passion as an ally to continue lifting up black lives
972900	977140	in Seattle and all over our country.
977140	980500	There is a lot left to do.
980500	981500	Thank you.
981500	984140	Diaz Love is currently recovering from their injuries.
984140	989340	They released a statement on Facebook reading, I'm alive and stable in a lot of pain.
989340	991300	I cannot believe Summer was murdered.
991300	995740	If they thought this murder would make us back down, they are very wrong.
996740	999540	My FB is filled with death threats.
999540	1003020	That and only being able to use one hand has me going slow.
1003020	1006740	I deeply appreciate and feel all the love y'all are sending me.
1006740	1012520	I've included links to the GoFundMe pages for Summer's family and Diaz Love below.
1012520	1017580	This was a tough video to do, especially since many of the details are not yet available.
1017580	1022940	This case has not gone to trial, and the driver accused of the crime has not even been arraigned,
1022940	1027140	so details are a bit sparse, but I wanted to focus on how someone's death and injury
1027140	1032140	and how these car attacks in general are being spun to discredit very legitimate and valid
1032140	1033880	protest movements.
1033880	1038700	If you enjoyed this video, I would once again remind you that there are two GoFundMe pages
1038700	1040740	for the victims linked below.
1040740	1045180	If you would like to support my work, as many of the people going up the screen have, you
1045180	1046900	can join my Patreon.
1046900	1051940	And if you signed up for the $5 a month tier, you will get your name in the credits, like
1051940	1057220	these lovely people here, a download to my theme song, written and performed by my lovely
1057220	1060220	friend Dana, and early access to my videos.
1060220	1064940	There actually is a video currently waiting to be uploaded to this channel that is available
1064940	1067940	for my Patrons, that's there if you're interested as well.
1067940	1071420	Thank you everyone very much for watching this video.
1071420	1075140	Please remember to like, comment, subscribe, and ring the bell.
1075140	1076460	I'll see you next time.
