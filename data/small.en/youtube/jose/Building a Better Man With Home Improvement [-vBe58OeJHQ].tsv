0	8000	Does everybody know what time it is?
8000	10360	Time to have a critical reading about a sitcom from the 90s.
10360	17360	At least I get to talk about it with Jose.
17360	22160	Back in the 90s, one of TV's most successful sitcoms was Home Improvement.
22160	28080	Debuting on September 17, 1991, Home Improvement was an instant hit with audiences, although
28080	29440	never a critical darling.
29440	35160	Throughout its eight-season run, it remained one of the top ten most watched shows on television.
35160	39180	In spite of its broad appeal, or perhaps because of it, the show only received a handful of
39180	42320	award nominations, including eight prime-time Emmys.
42320	47480	The series didn't win a single one, though it did win five technical Emmys for lighting.
47480	52280	With a grunt and a few explosions, Home Improvement found its way into the hearts of millions
52280	57080	of Americans, all tuning in to see what the toolman would do next.
57080	61960	But before this show hit it big, it started with one man in particular, a stand-up comic
61960	62960	named Tim Allen.
62960	67140	Allen began performing stand-up in 1978 after he was dared into it by a friend.
67140	71400	He honed his craft over the next decade, including a brief stay in prison where he served just
71400	73760	over two years for possession of cocaine.
73760	77640	He eventually moved to Los Angeles, where he became a regular at the comedy store, and
77640	80280	eventually he had a pair of specials on Showtime.
80280	84320	He rose to fame using his signature theme of men struggling to cope with the modern
84320	99360	world, often with grunting.
99360	104720	After being scouted by the heads of ABC, Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, Allen was chosen
104720	106920	to be the lead for a sitcom pilot.
106920	112960	He was teamed with TV producers Carmen Finestra, David McFadzian, and Matt Williams.
112960	118360	Williams and McFadzian had recently left the hit sitcom Roseanne, and in spite of past
118360	122960	difficulties working with a stand-up, Williams was won over by talking to Tim Allen about
122960	125480	their days growing up in the Midwest.
125480	130080	Tim Allen's ideas heavily shaped the early concept of the sitcom under its original title,
130080	131320	Hammer Time.
131320	137760	This title, for reasons too legit to quit, had to be dropped, so they stopped Hammer Time
137760	139680	and went with Home Improvement.
139720	143800	Home Improvement is one of those rare sitcoms that seemed to be fully formed from its first
143800	148120	episode, although there was a bit more turbulence getting there than you might imagine.
148120	153240	It would star Tim Allen as Tim Taylor, the host of a local TV home repair show in Detroit,
153240	154240	Michigan.
154240	168880	Tim's wife Jill was originally cast to be Frances Fisher.
168880	173400	The producers didn't find her to be a great fit, so she was replaced by Patricia Richardson
173400	174840	while filming the pilot.
174840	178520	Jill's role is to hold the family together at home, all while trying to make a life for
178520	190200	herself that's more than being a homemaker.
190200	194000	She and Tim also have the timeless struggle of holding a marriage together.
194000	209320	Brad, played by Zachary Tybrian, is their oldest son.
209320	214080	Much like his dad, he's into cars and working with his hands, but he's also an athlete.
214080	217280	And in earlier seasons, you can see him with this hair crime.
217280	235600	Brad also inherited Tim's sharp intellect.
235600	240360	Randy is played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, the wisecracker of the Taylor boys.
240360	244720	Randy is more into the arts, and in later seasons he has a budding social conscience.
244720	258520	Mark, played by Taron Noah-Smith, is the youngest, and grows from being a small boy
258520	262640	who idolizes his father to being a TV version of a goth.
262640	275920	Also, he's kind of into films towards the end.
275920	279840	Living next door to the Taylor's is their eccentric neighbor, Wilson Wilson.
279840	283840	Although originally played by John Bedford Lloyd, he backed out of the role after learning
283840	287560	he would spend the whole series with his face obscured by a fence.
287560	300280	He was replaced by Earl Hindman.
300280	305200	On the set of Tool Time, Tim was joined by Al Borland, played by Richard Karn.
305200	308920	Originally a completely different character named Glenn, the actor slated to play Tim
308920	313400	Taylor's sidekick, Steven Tobolowsky, was booked on a movie and couldn't make time
313400	314700	to appear on the pilot.
314700	319400	The character of Al was only supposed to be temporary, a one-off character in the pilot,
319400	324780	but Alan liked him so much that Karn became a regular on the series, replacing Tobolowsky.
324780	330220	Al is the competent, sensitive, and kind yin to Tim's incompetent, manic, and abrasive
330220	331220	yang.
331220	342100	He's also a bit of a softy.
342100	344140	That's one hell of a first dateline.
344140	345860	Al's a bit clingy when it comes to women.
345860	350540	The final character was Tool Time's Tool Girl, Lisa, originally to be played by Ashley
350540	351580	Judd.
351580	355980	She was initially a modern girl who would be a foil to Tim's old-fashioned ideas, but
355980	360660	when Judd backed out of the series for a movie career instead, the role of Lisa was dramatically
360660	364460	reduced, and it was given to first-time actress Pamela Anderson.
364460	368820	With the cast assembled, the show was ready to debut, tackling how masculinity would define
368820	370060	itself in the 90s.
370060	380240	It's not the most original premise, but hey, this version has grunting.
380240	384340	The series opens with an introduction to the show within a show, as we see Tim watching
384340	385620	himself on Tool Time.
385620	388660	You know, men, we want a job done right, and we want it done quick.
388660	389660	What do we need?
389660	390660	More power!
390660	392620	Turn right, more power.
392620	395500	We're quickly introduced to our first crisis.
395500	398380	Stay-at-home mother Jill has a job interview.
398380	401100	Tim, this job is important to me.
401100	403460	Aren't you excited about me going back to work?
403460	407860	Yeah, sure, yeah, sure.
407860	409620	Could you maybe work up a little enthusiasm?
409620	411020	I'm sorry, honey.
411020	415060	Gosh, I'm excited that you won't be laying around the house mooching off the boys and
415060	416060	me!
416060	420900	The introduction to Wilson establishes his role as the sage neighbor who offers Tim advice,
420900	423980	most often through the lens of a male-centric reading of history.
424380	428580	The reason you're having problems with your wife is because you don't know who you are
428580	429580	as a man.
429580	432620	I don't have a problem in that area, Wilson.
432620	435620	Not what I mean, Tim.
435620	439100	A lot of men feel lost, confused.
439100	442940	You see, Tim, the Industrial Revolution took the adult male out of the home.
442940	447340	Boys were left without an older man to teach them how to be men.
447340	449740	We need to get back to something more primitive.
449740	454900	You don't need testosterone to be a handyman, but what this show does so well is show us
454900	458900	how mythology can be selectively read to reinforce certain worldviews.
458900	463940	Wilson's job is to cherry-pick parts of history to fit that masculine stereotype.
463940	468460	Although his ideology and personality are often inconsistent, sometimes Wilson will
468460	470060	have a really good take.
470060	474460	But other times, like this episode, not so much.
474460	479340	You see, Tim, it's time for men to reclaim the male's spirit.
479340	483540	The idea of an inherent male-ness that's being trampled on by a modern society is at
483540	485420	the heart of home improvement.
485420	486940	It's early seasons in particular.
486940	488940	You don't have to feel bad.
488940	489940	Don't.
489940	490940	Tell me how to feel.
490940	491940	I'm just saying, if it were me, well, I would…
491940	492940	It's not you, Tim, it's me.
492940	497180	What I mean is you don't have to work.
497180	498860	You don't really want me to work.
498860	500820	No, no, no, no, no, no.
500820	502460	I make enough money for both of us.
502460	504300	No, this is not about money.
504300	508340	This is about me having a life outside of this house.
508340	509340	My autonomy.
509340	510340	Your autonomy?
510340	511340	Yeah.
511340	512340	How do you spell that?
512340	513340	Don't start.
513340	516540	While Tim is presented as the prototypical man, a constant through history confronted
516540	520860	by this strange new reality, he's really just an American man whose attitudes are
520860	522380	a few decades out of date.
522380	525340	He's bound to a very specific time and culture.
525340	530300	When Tim grunts, he's signaling that his masculinity is imbued into our DNA, something
530300	532660	primal, something primitive.
532660	536380	The grunting is actually a facade, and that facade will be challenged throughout this
536380	537380	series.
537900	542100	And it's worth noting, as the series goes along, Tim grunts less and less.
542100	547100	I just, I can't tell you how impressed I am by the emotional debt that I've seen
547100	548100	in you like…
548100	553500	Oh, you know, I've always had this sneaky yet slightly disturbing suspicion that there
553500	555820	actually might be something to me.
555820	560900	Oh, come on, bring me back my old Tim.
560900	561900	Grunt for me.
561900	564900	Give it a shot.
565900	570900	Oh, I don't know.
570900	575900	Argra, Argra, I don't think it's happening.
575900	580900	It's not happening, honey.
580900	581900	Mmm.
581900	584900	Oh, yeah.
584900	590460	The reaction of critics to the first episode wasn't particularly favorable, as Tim Allen
590460	592900	himself would note a decade later.
593900	595900	Critics didn't really like the show that much.
595900	598900	As a matter of fact, I mean, there's a bunch of critics that, you know, it just won't
598900	599900	last.
599900	603900	There was one newspaper, I'm not going to mention the New York Times by name, but they…
603900	606900	Oh, that was really weird.
606900	608900	I mean, that's just slipped out.
608900	609900	I'm sorry.
609900	612900	They said the show couldn't go three episodes.
612900	617900	I mean, how many things can this meathead blow up?
618900	622900	But the show was an instant hit with viewers, and would be popular with TV audiences throughout
622900	623900	its entire run.
623900	628900	The idea of women living independently from men comes up a lot in the early seasons, and
628900	632900	since Tim is our focal point for this series, this is presented as a threat to his traditional
632900	634900	role as the grunting patriarch.
634900	640900	In the first season episode, Forever Young, young spelled J-U-N-G, we meet Jill's friend
640900	645900	Karen, played by Betsy Randall, who knows just how to get under Tim's skin.
645900	649900	Oh, well, Tim, I mean, it is a very big, powerful tool.
649900	650900	I see.
650900	653900	You think I've got to have this just to prove my manhood.
653900	654900	You said it.
654900	655900	I didn't say that.
655900	658900	There's one question in particular that makes him squirm, though.
658900	659900	We're a 90s couple.
659900	662900	We share everything 50-50 right down the middle.
662900	663900	Come sit down.
663900	665900	Okay, let me give you a little test.
665900	668900	Jill gets a high-paying executive position.
668900	670900	I like this test already.
670900	672900	Do I get to have a male secretary?
672900	673900	You got him.
673900	675900	That's right, but he looks really cute in jeans.
675900	676900	Perfect.
676900	679900	Okay, so, Tim, should she take this job?
679900	680900	If he's gay.
687900	689900	Yeah, absolutely.
689900	691900	The job's in Seattle.
691900	693900	So, it's fine, it's fine.
693900	696900	Well, maybe Jill doesn't want to uproot the kids.
696900	698900	No, no, no, the kids love the idea.
698900	700900	Do we move, Tim?
700900	701900	Karen, this is stupid.
701900	703900	Okay, okay, let me ask you another question.
703900	707900	Tool time goes national, but you have to move to New York.
707900	708900	Do you go?
708900	709900	Yeah, it's my job.
709900	714900	It'd be perfect—if it's okay with Jill.
714900	718900	Oh, so you're saying that your job is more important than hers?
718900	719900	She didn't have a job.
719900	720900	Answer the question, Tim.
720900	722900	Do you move to New York or Seattle?
722900	725900	I think a lot depends on where you'll be living.
725900	730900	Unlike most encounters with Wilson where Tim struggles to understand tough concepts,
730900	732900	he gets this episode's theme right away.
732900	737900	Well, Tim, that's just the burden you bear for living in a patriarchal society.
737900	738900	Yeah, patriarchal.
738900	740900	Dominated by men.
742900	743900	Well, I don't know, Tim.
743900	747900	Maybe one day, men and women will learn to share the power.
747900	750900	To cooperate rather than dominate.
750900	752900	Wilson's take here is surprisingly good,
752900	755900	and one that leads to a decent conclusion for the episode,
755900	757900	as Brad is heading out to his first dance,
757900	759900	and Tim offers some botherly advice.
760900	761900	Yeah.
761900	765900	But what if I lead with the wrong foot or step on her toes?
765900	767900	Dancing's not about who's leading.
767900	770900	Mom says the man always leads.
770900	774900	Well, when men and women are dancing correctly, no one's leading.
774900	776900	You just move with the music.
776900	778900	You don't know how you get there, but you just get there.
778900	781900	There's no easy solution for how men and women will live together,
781900	783900	but it ends with Brad going on his first date
783900	788900	where his gruff or masculine side is made tamer by his attraction to Jennifer.
788900	790900	You're not down here, will you?
792900	794900	I'll be here in a minute, father!
795900	796900	Father?
796900	799900	The idea here is that men and women can bring out the best in each other,
799900	803900	so it's better that we work together instead of one side dominating the other,
803900	807900	like dancing together and not pretending we know who leads.
807900	812900	The show doesn't pretend it'll be easy, but part of an ongoing process.
812900	814900	There's still problems of men and women
814900	816900	used to their static, essential characteristics,
816900	820900	but offering an opportunity of growth is where the show offers a glimpse of promise.
820900	822900	Older viewers might be thinking,
822900	825900	even for the 90s, this isn't exactly cutting edge.
825900	830900	We saw vestiges of old masculinity being challenged as far back as all in the family.
830900	834900	I'm sure we can all point to shows doing the exact same thing, airing right now.
834900	837900	That's because this discussion about how men and women can share power
837900	841900	isn't something that's gone away, and it won't go away until we figure it out.
841900	844900	It's one of the few parts of home improvement that still has some relevance,
844900	846900	and can still speak to what's happening today,
846900	850900	because in spite of all the progress we've made, misogyny is still a thing,
850900	855900	and we're still trying to build a world where men and women can actually be seen as equal.
855900	859900	But even in episodes where it felt like Tim's character was making some kind of progress,
859900	862900	some of them were like the season 3 episode,
862900	864900	What You See Is What You Get,
864900	867900	where he starts so far back that he comes off as a complete jerk.
867900	870900	You know, I've been researching that article on plastic surgery.
870900	874900	I just interviewed a woman who bought herself a whole new body,
874900	878900	because her husband left her for a younger woman.
878900	881900	They were married 12 years, had four kids.
884900	885900	She made a big mistake.
885900	887900	I'm glad you feel that way.
887900	888900	Yeah.
888900	891900	Had she had this surgery some time ago, she could have saved the marriage.
893900	895900	Tim has another bad reaction when he sees Jill messing around
895900	899900	with a computerized version of herself that would show what she looks like
899900	901900	should she have plastic surgery.
903900	904900	Wow.
904900	905900	What?
905900	906900	Wow.
908900	910900	Are you saying you think I look good like that?
914900	916900	And he keeps digging himself deeper.
922900	923900	Jill, you gotta see this.
923900	925900	Now I know why they call it the boob tube.
925900	926900	Look at this.
927900	933900	The resolution for this episode is Tim acknowledging that he would like to be with his wife no matter how old she gets.
933900	937900	It's simple, bland, and uninteresting.
937900	940900	Tim's personality seems harsher overall in this episode,
940900	946900	but maybe it's because I went into this episode knowing it was the only one in the entire series where Tim Allen had a writing credit.
946900	950900	It makes me think that if Tim Allen had had a stronger influence on the scripts earlier on,
950900	954900	perhaps writing them himself, he may not have come off so likeable.
954900	957900	We need to take a slight detour from our discussion about the early seasons
957900	961900	to talk about the big change in the show between seasons 2 and 3.
961900	963900	And that's the passing of the Tool Girl tool belt.
963900	969900	Not satisfied with her role on the show, which usually involved a thought-provoking line about temporality.
970900	972900	Does everybody know what time it is?
972900	973900	Tool time!
973900	979900	Pamela Anderson left home improvement after the second season in pursuit of a more challenging acting role on Baywatch.
979900	986900	The show gave her an increase in lines and plot threads, along with an even bigger increase in time spent running in slow motion.
986900	991900	Anderson would be replaced by Debbie Dunning in the first episode of season 3.
991900	994900	Our new Tool Girl would be named Heidi.
994900	997900	This wasn't Dunning's first appearance on the show, though,
997900	1003900	as she played a completely different character in the episode Overactive Glance in the second season.
1003900	1007900	In that episode, her name was, uh...
1008900	1011900	Yeah, that.
1011900	1015900	Dunning would have a larger role than Anderson as the series progressed,
1015900	1020900	having a handful of plot lines dedicated to her character and more lines throughout the episodes.
1020900	1026900	And we also got a neat little Tool Girl crossover in season 6 when Pamela Anderson came back for an episode.
1026900	1031900	I think Pamela Anderson had more lines in this episode than the entirety of the first two seasons.
1031900	1035900	In the seventh season, Dunning would finally get her name in the opening credits of the series,
1035900	1039900	but her role was never as expansive as any of the other regular characters on the series.
1039900	1042900	All that being said, she does a good job with what she's given,
1042900	1047900	and if they were looking to replace one gorgeous woman with another, they definitely succeeded.
1048900	1050900	Back to the early seasons.
1050900	1054900	A major concern for the early seasons is how Tim struggles with raising his three sons.
1054900	1056900	There are a number of episodes that deal with this,
1056900	1062900	though one of the more notable ones is rights and wrongs of passage in which Brad enters a rebellious phase.
1063900	1066900	You are beyond grounded. No TV, no seeing your friends, no talking on the phone.
1066900	1068900	No monster truck rally.
1068900	1069900	That's not fair.
1069900	1071900	What do you mean it's not fair? I stick up for you so you can go,
1071900	1073900	and what do you end up doing coming on with a cop?
1073900	1075900	I'm going to the truck rally.
1075900	1077900	You're going to bed.
1077900	1079900	You can't tell me what to do.
1079900	1081900	Yes, I can tell you what to do. That's my job.
1081900	1083900	Now go on upstairs.
1083900	1087900	And you can forget about those Fordzilla tickets because I've given him somebody else.
1087900	1088900	Can I have a nilly?
1088900	1090900	Oh, shut up!
1090900	1093900	Tim gives us one of his not-so-good takes to explain it.
1093900	1097900	But unfortunately, in our industrial society, we don't have these rituals.
1097900	1101900	We prolong adolescence beyond the biological indications of manhood,
1101900	1104900	confusing the child as well as the parent.
1104900	1108900	The idea of a teenager acting out being a product of the 19th century
1108900	1112900	would be news to anyone who's read or seen Romeo and Juliet.
1112900	1117900	So I don't really buy his explanation as to why we're getting a Breaking Brad episode.
1117900	1119900	You like that's a pretty good pun, right?
1119900	1122900	Breaking Brad? No? No.
1122900	1125900	Tim's eventual solution is to give Brad a taste of manhood.
1125900	1127900	Or at least, manhood as Tim defines it.
1127900	1129900	What are you trying to do?
1129900	1132900	I've got the tailpipe set up for the exhaust system.
1132900	1133900	I could do it.
1133900	1135900	Oh, this is man stuff.
1135900	1138900	You've got to do all the torture and flame and...
1141900	1143900	Why don't you give it a shot?
1144900	1147900	We see another example of the importance of masculine coding
1147900	1150900	in Growing Up in Bell Bottom Blues,
1150900	1153900	where Brad gets in trouble for fighting another kid.
1153900	1155900	You're grounded three days, you know that.
1155900	1156900	That's not fair.
1156900	1158900	Why did you hit this boy?
1158900	1160900	Because he was making fun of me.
1160900	1162900	That's not a reason to punch anybody.
1162900	1164900	Why are you angry at me? It's your fault.
1164900	1167900	B-B, back the truck up.
1167900	1169900	Why is it my fault?
1169900	1171900	This morning when you dropped me off at school,
1171900	1174900	you hugged me in front of all my friends.
1174900	1177900	Once again, Wilson gives us a bad take.
1177900	1178900	It's a funny thing, you know.
1178900	1179900	He doesn't want me to touch him,
1179900	1181900	but he'll still wrestle in Rough House with me.
1181900	1182900	Well, that's because throughout history,
1182900	1183900	men have been more comfortable
1183900	1186900	expressing affection through combative gestures.
1186900	1188900	Men have shared affectionate gestures,
1188900	1191900	like hugging and holding hands in plenty of cultures,
1191900	1194900	but in this episode, Wilson is cherry-picking from history.
1194900	1196900	Not that Wilson is entirely wrong
1196900	1198900	with his examples of handshakes and salutes,
1198900	1201900	but the point is Wilson is only sharing one side of the story
1201900	1204900	that holds up a specific vision of manhood.
1204900	1209900	The resolution of the Brad plot has Tim agreeing not to hug him anymore.
1209900	1212900	Remember, I'm your father. I'm not a man.
1215900	1216900	Right, Dad.
1216900	1218900	Anyway, I promise I won't hug in front of your buddies anymore.
1218900	1219900	Okay.
1219900	1221900	But I'm still gonna say I love you.
1221900	1224900	Oh, Dad, that's ten times worse than hugging.
1224900	1227900	It seems absurd to bow to this social pressure.
1227900	1229900	There's nothing wrong with a father hugging his son,
1229900	1231900	especially a son who's still in grade school.
1231900	1233900	But what can be read here instead is
1233900	1236900	how Tim's parenting can't escape the demands of a society
1236900	1239900	that has certain expectations of men,
1239900	1242900	even when Tim himself thinks they're silly.
1242900	1244900	So it's not that Tim is a bad father,
1244900	1247900	but rather a victim of the intense pressure put on boys
1247900	1250900	to behave within a certain masculine ideal.
1250900	1251900	And that ideal, in this case,
1251900	1254900	would be not to express affection physically.
1254900	1258900	A less conventional father-son dynamic is Tim's relationship with Randy.
1258900	1260900	Seen in To Build or Not to Build,
1260900	1263900	Randy doesn't take to the workshop projects his brothers do
1263900	1265900	when they're making Mother's Day gifts for Jill.
1265900	1268900	Look, Dad, I'll just buy Mom something.
1268900	1270900	I'll buy her something.
1270900	1272900	I don't like doing this stuff.
1272900	1273900	Yeah, you'll like it.
1273900	1276900	Dad, I didn't want to do this in the first place.
1276900	1277900	Oh, and I just finished it for you.
1277900	1278900	Great.
1280900	1282900	And tellingly, the episode seen with Wilson
1282900	1284900	doesn't have him doling out classical wisdom
1284900	1286900	on what it means to be a man.
1286900	1287900	This is a new problem,
1287900	1291900	something that the traditional masculinity that Wilson espouses,
1291900	1293900	which is really just a masculine cliché,
1293900	1294900	can't really cope with.
1294900	1297900	Instead, we see Wilson and his mother exchange a few lines
1297900	1300900	about the importance of a gift's spirit.
1300900	1302900	After all, it was Pierre Cornet,
1302900	1304900	the noted French playwright who wrote,
1304900	1308900	I am in the habit of looking not so much to the nature of the gift
1308900	1310900	as to the spirit in which it is given.
1310900	1312900	Oh, that's beautiful.
1312900	1315900	Excuse me, son, are you sure it was Cornet?
1315900	1318900	I believe it was Robert Louis Stevenson.
1318900	1321900	Well, by golly, Mom, I think you're right.
1322900	1324900	Pierre Cornet wrote,
1324900	1327900	the manner of giving is worth more than the gift.
1327900	1331900	It shows us an example of perhaps a more useful reading of history
1331900	1334900	and ancient wisdom by dispensing with the gender coding
1334900	1337900	and instead getting to the heart of a message.
1338900	1340900	While Brad's path to manhood is more conventional,
1340900	1343900	Randy shows us that there's more than one way to make a man
1343900	1345900	and that the idea of manhood is more expansive
1345900	1347900	than the narrow vision of Wilson's definitions
1347900	1350900	filled with essentialist commentary on what a man is.
1350900	1352900	The passage from boyhood to manhood
1352900	1355900	is one that creates a lot of frustration and anxiety,
1355900	1357900	and growing up, it's only natural for a boy to have questions
1357900	1359900	on what it means to become a man.
1359900	1361900	What makes the old story shared by Wilson
1361900	1364900	and modern masculinity represented in Tim so appealing
1364900	1368900	is that it reduces the confusion of figuring out what it means to be a man.
1368900	1371900	There's something comforting about a whole set of behaviors
1371900	1374900	and customs designed for men to inherit when they come of age.
1374900	1376900	It takes a lot of the difficulty out of growing up
1376900	1378900	when someone has a path charted out for you.
1378900	1381900	But what if you're like Randy and you don't fit into that mold?
1381900	1383900	How do you find your way towards manhood?
1383900	1386900	It seems that the definition of what it means to be a man
1386900	1388900	needs to expand to include more types of people.
1388900	1390900	In the context of home improvement,
1390900	1392900	that means allowing manhood to expand
1392900	1395900	beyond sports and power tools to include magic tricks
1395900	1397900	and performing in school plays.
1397900	1399900	This is still a show from the 90s, though,
1399900	1401900	and it can only get us so far.
1401900	1403900	It's broadening the definition of what it means to be a man,
1403900	1407900	but it's still very much only representing the cis white hetero perspective.
1407900	1410900	Non-white men are never a part of the principal cast,
1410900	1411900	and neither are gay men.
1411900	1413900	The closest glimpse we even get of trans men
1413900	1415900	are some less-than-enlightened jokes.
1415900	1417900	So what's more important than the show's banal message
1417900	1420900	of saying that it's okay for a boy to want to perform magic tricks
1420900	1422900	is the deeper meaning behind it.
1422900	1425900	Rather than exclude people who don't fit the typical definition of manhood,
1425900	1427900	it's better to expand that definition
1427900	1430900	and celebrate the differences we see around us.
1430900	1433900	Now let's talk about getting hit in the dick.
1433900	1436900	Another big part of this series is Tim getting hurt.
1436900	1437900	A lot.
1437900	1439900	Pretty much every episode of Home Improvement includes a scene
1439900	1441900	where some home repair project goes wrong
1441900	1444900	and Tim usually gets hurt.
1444900	1447900	Nothing ever too serious, but, you know, we see that he feels pain.
1447900	1449900	In the series' first clip show,
1449900	1452900	a two-parter titled Tool Time After Dark,
1452900	1455900	there were no clips shown of the Taylor family drama.
1455900	1458900	Instead, we saw a bunch of random Tool Time episodes
1458900	1462900	featuring Tim getting hurt in a variety of stunts.
1462900	1464900	The slapstick elements of humor for this series
1464900	1466900	are very much baked into its DNA,
1466900	1469900	which makes complete sense because slapstick is a type of humor
1469900	1471900	particularly suited to men.
1471900	1473900	Let's talk humor theory for a moment.
1473900	1475900	The reason slapstick works
1475900	1477900	is because it takes the violation of a norm,
1477900	1480900	in this case, a person suffering physical harm
1480900	1482900	and or being embarrassed,
1482900	1484900	and presents it in a way that's benign.
1484900	1486900	This is known as the benign violation theory.
1486900	1489900	And the reason it's benign is because it's happening to a man.
1489900	1492900	The assumption here is that men are big and strong
1492900	1495900	so they can handle the punishment and pain of something going awry
1495900	1498900	whereas women are fragile and need to be protected.
1498900	1501900	While Home Improvement may question what it means to be a man in the 90s,
1501900	1504900	it never backs away from the idea that there is an archetype of what a man is
1504900	1506900	and that includes being big and strong,
1506900	1509900	or at the very least, bigger and stronger than women.
1509900	1511900	That's why whenever things go wrong on Tool Time,
1511900	1514900	the victim is usually Tim, occasionally Al,
1514900	1516900	and once in a while a male guest star.
1516900	1519900	At no point are Lisa or Heidi ever in danger,
1519900	1522900	much in the way Jill is rarely in danger either,
1522900	1525900	because slapstick is about upholding certain gender roles.
1525900	1527900	When you think slapstick, you'll think of something like
1527900	1530900	The Three Stooges or Charlie Chaplin.
1530900	1531900	Typically it's a man.
1531900	1533900	There aren't many women who engage in slapstick comedy.
1534900	1537900	Partially from the assumption that it's not funny when it happens to women
1537900	1539900	because women are more likely to get hurt.
1544900	1547900	In the early seasons, one of the three lines in each episode
1547900	1549900	was Tim building his hot rod in the garage.
1549900	1552900	The significance behind the hot rod is summed up nicely
1552900	1554900	in this scene in the Season 2 episode
1554900	1556900	where there's a will, there's a way.
1563900	1565900	God, it was a hardtop convertible. Those were tough to get.
1565900	1568900	You can't find them. Boy, that was a great car.
1569900	1571900	You know, and then he died.
1576900	1578900	Uncle Harry took the car and he sold it.
1578900	1579900	We'd never seen it again.
1579900	1584900	And that was the best thing I ever remember about my dad.
1585900	1588900	Season 4 capitalizes on the setup of these earlier episodes
1588900	1591900	to hit the father theme particularly hard,
1591900	1594900	specifically the search for an absent father.
1594900	1597900	In He Ain't Heavy, He's Just Irresponsible,
1597900	1600900	we meet one of Tim's brothers, Marty, played by William O'Leary.
1600900	1603900	A new father, Marty is considering running away
1603900	1606900	from his struggling marriage and newborn twin daughters.
1615900	1618900	He eventually decides not to abandon his family.
1618900	1622900	We hit the father theme again in My Dinner with Wilson,
1622900	1625900	where Wilson, who's thinking of moving to Ecuador,
1625900	1627900	would be leaving Tim without a father figure.
1636900	1638900	Of course, Wilson decides to stay.
1649900	1652900	No, no, I think I'm gonna stay right here.
1654900	1659900	In Ye Olde Shop Teacher, Tim's high school shop teacher comes to visit
1659900	1663900	and Tim has to deal with seeing one of his adoptive father figures becoming older.
1663900	1667900	And Jill's rarely seen father visits at Christmas in
1667900	1670900	Twas the Night Before Chaos, where she has to learn how to connect with him.
1670900	1674900	And this was all in the first half of the season.
1674900	1676900	That's why this is the daddy season to me,
1676900	1680900	because so much of it was trapped in this search for a positive father figure.
1680900	1684900	And that's outside the usual father-son dynamic between Tim and his sons.
1684900	1687900	The hot rod, symbolizing Tim's relationship with his dad,
1687900	1689900	is the subject of,
1689900	1691900	Brother, can you spare a hot rod?
1691900	1695900	In which Tim decides to sell the hot rod to pizza entrepreneur Doug O'Brien,
1695900	1700900	played by Bruce McGill, whose pizza chain, by the way, is named Papa Mia.
1700900	1703900	Although Tim is just fine selling his beloved hot rod,
1703900	1706900	the family, and Brad in particular, don't take it well.
1721900	1724900	Considering how Tim felt about his uncle selling his dad's hot rod,
1724900	1726900	maybe he should have seen this coming.
1726900	1729900	When Tim and Brad go to O'Brien to try and get the hot rod back,
1729900	1731900	we find out what that car meant to him.
1731900	1733900	Unsurprisingly, it involves his father.
1734900	1737900	Tim and Brad find an old 46 Ford converter,
1737900	1763900	Tim and Brad find an old 46 Ford convertible,
1763900	1765900	that becomes a new project for the father and son.
1765900	1769900	It reframes the relationship, moving it from the finished product of a car,
1769900	1771900	and instead highlighting what matters most,
1771900	1773900	the time they spent building it together.
1774900	1778900	The search for a father is more than just the presence of a man in one's life,
1778900	1781900	but rather the experiences that a positive father figure brings with it.
1781900	1785900	Much of home improvement assumes that manhood and fatherhood are linked.
1785900	1788900	Not insofar that one's genes must be passed down,
1788900	1791900	but instead being a positive father figure in the life of a young boy,
1791900	1793900	guiding them to manhood.
1793900	1795900	Search for a father figure prevalent in this season,
1795900	1798900	shows that this isn't strictly a challenge for children,
1798900	1800900	but rather something men need throughout their lives.
1800900	1802900	A connection to these moments in their past,
1802900	1805900	and new mentors and guides for the ones still to come.
1805900	1808900	It's also a role not to be shirked off or ignored.
1808900	1810900	It carries with it a pretty heavy burden.
1810900	1814900	And I appreciate the idea that fathers and sons can come in many forms.
1814900	1816900	Speaking of father figures,
1816900	1819900	let's talk about the series regular who is like a father figure,
1819900	1821900	Wilson Wilson.
1821900	1823900	What's up with this guy?
1823900	1825900	We've already looked at how inconsistent his advice is,
1825900	1828900	but aside from his role as wisdom giver in this series,
1828900	1830900	who is he as a character?
1830900	1832900	In the season one episode,
1832900	1834900	Birds of a Feather Flock to tailor,
1834900	1836900	Tim and Jill are having some marital strife,
1836900	1838900	and then after having made up,
1838900	1840900	hang out in a small bar and dance.
1840900	1843900	Here's the weird thing about this scene.
1843900	1846900	Wilson isn't in it until this part right here.
1846900	1849900	The rest of the time, you only see this mysterious guy in the background,
1849900	1851900	reading a newspaper.
1851900	1852900	He has no lines,
1852900	1854900	and the only other time we see this bar in the episode,
1854900	1856900	Wilson isn't in it.
1856900	1858900	So it's not like this is his regular haunt.
1858900	1862900	The only answer here is that Wilson is stalking the Taylor family.
1862900	1866900	How else can we explain Wilson suddenly showing up in the wilderness
1866900	1869900	to offer Tim some advice when the family goes camping,
1869900	1871900	in the middle of winter?
1871900	1874900	Or how does Wilson show up in the hospital later on
1874900	1876900	when, again, Tim needs some advice
1876900	1880900	and Wilson is there delivering a baby as a midwife?
1880900	1882900	In the season three episode,
1882900	1884900	Twas the Blight Before Christmas,
1884900	1886900	we see Wilson once again stalking the Taylors,
1886900	1888900	this time at church.
1888900	1890900	He doesn't have any lines in this scene.
1890900	1892900	None of the other characters acknowledge him,
1892900	1895900	and this time the camera doesn't even settle on him.
1895900	1897900	Watching this show as a kid,
1897900	1899900	I never noticed he was there.
1899900	1900900	But he was.
1900900	1902900	He was there.
1902900	1904900	Imagine living next to this guy.
1904900	1907900	Sure, there's a 50-50 chance he'll hit you with some wisdom,
1907900	1909900	but the rest of the time he'll have this weird,
1909900	1911900	essentialist, male-centric reading of history.
1911900	1913900	In the season four episode,
1913900	1914900	Wilson's Girlfriend,
1914900	1917900	Wilson finally has the chance to be more than an eccentric neighbor
1917900	1919900	and to get some love on the regular.
1919900	1921900	Jill introduces him to her professor.
1921900	1923900	Well, nice to meet you.
1923900	1925900	You too. Jill has told me so much about you.
1925900	1927900	It's all been great.
1927900	1928900	Well, I am flattered.
1928900	1930900	The only thing she didn't tell me was your last name.
1930900	1931900	It's Wilson.
1931900	1933900	Oh, I thought that was your first name.
1933900	1935900	Wilson is my first name.
1937900	1940900	We soon learn that Wilson, for all his sagacity,
1940900	1942900	can't seem to share his feelings.
1942900	1944900	He's more into ideas.
1944900	1945900	Oh, my, my, my,
1945900	1947900	I must be displaying the symptomatic behavior
1947900	1949900	of the classic male emotional distancer
1949900	1952900	precipitating her to over-function in the relationship,
1952900	1955900	therefore causing deep-seated resentment.
1955900	1958900	So knock it off.
1958900	1962900	Tim, I don't take easily the personal or emotional revelation.
1962900	1963900	No guy does.
1963900	1966900	Opening up emotion is just a horrible thing women make us do.
1966900	1969900	What we're seeing here is the patriarchal standard-bearer
1969900	1972900	acknowledging that having a whole other side of humanity introduced to him,
1972900	1976900	in this case from a woman, makes him a more complete being.
1976900	1979900	Wilson is effectively removing the mask of masculinity
1979900	1981900	represented by this little bit of imagery.
1981900	1985900	And I really like this scene because it gets to the heart of Wilson as a character.
1985900	1989900	Well, my family never really talked much about personal matters,
1989900	1992900	especially my father, Wilson Wilson Sr.
1995900	1997900	What was he like?
1997900	2002900	He was a scientist who didn't put too much stock in emotions.
2002900	2005900	Must have been very difficult to grow up with a man like that.
2005900	2007900	Mm, it was.
2007900	2010900	You know, I loved my father and
2010900	2014900	it always hurt me when he kept me at a distance.
2014900	2017900	And the last thing I ever wanted was to be like him.
2018900	2022900	The primitive man believed that the air he breathed had magic powers.
2023900	2025900	I'm not bored.
2026900	2028900	And when a man and a woman kissed,
2030900	2032900	it was as if their souls were mingling.
2032900	2035900	Wilson's job on this show is to dispense wisdom,
2035900	2038900	all while keeping the lower half of his face hidden.
2038900	2042900	Wisdom, particularly related to feelings, is often the subject of what he says,
2042900	2045900	but he never reveals anything of his inner self.
2045900	2047900	While Wilson knows the value of both,
2047900	2050900	he struggles to escape the conditioning of his childhood.
2050900	2052900	Wilson's covered mouth is a metaphor.
2052900	2055900	The covered mouth is a gate, carefully letting the wisdom out
2055900	2057900	and keeping the feelings inside.
2057900	2061900	When he welcomes with a kiss, he's welcoming her into that space.
2061900	2064900	This would have been a great moment to let everyone see Wilson's face,
2064900	2067900	but sadly the gag would never be dropped,
2067900	2071900	and poor Oral Hinman, who does a fantastic job as Wilson, by the way,
2071900	2073900	has to continue standing behind it.
2073900	2076900	They even make him hold a stupid little mini-fence
2076900	2079900	when he has to do his curtain call at the end of each episode.
2079900	2082900	One lovely bit of subtext in this episode is that
2082900	2086900	Professor manages to be both rich in ideas and emotional expression,
2086900	2089900	whereas she's learned how to adopt traits that are traditionally coded as masculine
2089900	2091900	and become a more complete person.
2091900	2096900	Wilson is a victim of a society that has a rigid view of how men are supposed to behave.
2096900	2101900	While, yes, the series is still trapped in the narrow gender binary,
2101900	2104900	it at least acknowledges the profound impact society can have
2104900	2106900	on how those binaries are expressed,
2106900	2109900	almost as if they're on a spectrum or something,
2109900	2111900	and that little line separating them is arbitrary.
2111900	2115900	Wilson may be a bit of a creeper, but he has the capacity to grow.
2115900	2117900	Here he is in this Season 6 episode,
2117900	2120900	Burnin' Love, with a frightening revelation.
2120900	2124900	We were in fourth grade, I guess we were about nine years of age,
2124900	2129900	and we were inseparable until one day at the playground we had a big fight.
2129900	2130900	About what?
2130900	2132900	Well, I was a big believer in laissez-faire capitalism,
2132900	2134900	and she was a neo-Marxist.
2134900	2138900	Although this isn't confirmed in the show, I like to think,
2138900	2140900	much like learning to share his feelings,
2140900	2144900	Wilson grew out of believing in silly ideas like laissez-faire capitalism.
2144900	2147900	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
2147900	2150900	I don't have all that much to say about the fifth season.
2150900	2153900	One small thing is how Tim grew as a character
2153900	2156900	best exemplified in this scene from the episode
2156900	2158900	When Harry Kept Dolores.
2158900	2160900	You're evolving.
2160900	2162900	No, I'm not, and you take that back.
2162900	2164900	It's true, you are.
2164900	2166900	No, no, no, no, you're just saying that
2166900	2169900	because you want to believe that you married a deep guy.
2169900	2170900	No, I don't.
2170900	2171900	Yes.
2171900	2173900	Can't you see, you're just trying to prove that you married
2173900	2175900	somebody different than your father, honey?
2175900	2178900	Wow.
2178900	2181900	What?
2181900	2186900	That was an even more profound insight than the one that you had about Harry.
2186900	2190900	I can't stop myself. What's happening to me?
2190900	2193900	You're becoming insightful.
2193900	2195900	Oh, no.
2195900	2198900	But really, this was a season of one episode
2198900	2201900	and one that'll give me time to talk about another major player in the series,
2201900	2205900	the middle child, Randy, played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
2205900	2209900	If you were a girl in the 90s, it's pretty likely you had a crush on this boy.
2209900	2212900	He was on the cover of everything from Tiger Beat to Bob,
2212900	2215900	typically with the affectionate acronym JTT.
2215900	2218900	He really looked like he would be the breakout star of Home Improvement,
2218900	2221900	and for a while, he absolutely was.
2221900	2224900	He was on talk shows, he was at WrestleMania,
2224900	2228900	but he's perhaps best known for playing young Simba in The Lion King,
2228900	2230900	one of several movies he starred in.
2230900	2232900	Oh, sorry. I've never been a Lion King before.
2232900	2236900	Well, I have.
2236900	2240900	You know, I gotta tell you, it's a tough gig.
2240900	2242900	Everyone expects you to be king.
2242900	2244900	Playing the wise-cracking Randy,
2244900	2247900	Thomas had the chance to show off his great comedic timing,
2247900	2252900	but as the seasons wore on, it became apparent that he had a lot of range for an actor so young,
2252900	2257900	and so he increasingly got larger roles when it came to any drama surrounding the Taylor Boys.
2257900	2262900	But it was the season 5 episode, The Longest Day, that really showed what he could do.
2262900	2266900	This is one of those classic, very special episodes
2266900	2269900	sitcoms love to do when tackling heavier subjects.
2269900	2275900	In this one, a doctor's visit has revealed a mysterious lump on Randy's throat that may be cancerous.
2275900	2279900	Tim and Jill try to keep it secret from him, but he finds out.
2279900	2281900	I can't believe you guys gave me so good.
2281900	2288900	You know, if I didn't know better, I think I was dying.
2288900	2292900	That was a joke, guys.
2292900	2296900	It was a joke. I didn't get it at first, but I just got it. I got it.
2296900	2300900	Let your mom make sure she got it.
2300900	2302900	What's going on?
2302900	2306900	Is this of anything to do with that blood test I took yesterday?
2306900	2311900	Okay, yeah, but there's nothing for you to worry about.
2311900	2314900	Do you remember when the doctor was feeling your neck yesterday?
2314900	2315900	Yeah.
2315900	2318900	Well, she felt some swelling.
2318900	2322900	As they wait for test results from the doctor to come in,
2322900	2326900	Tim finds out Randy went missing after school, leading to...
2352900	2355900	Randy's kind of lumps can be malignant.
2355900	2360900	Randy, look, the chances of this lump being malignant are next to nothing.
2360900	2362900	How could you not tell me about this?
2362900	2364900	Because I didn't want you freaking out, okay?
2364900	2368900	Oh, so instead I read about it on a computer sitting in the school library all by myself.
2368900	2371900	Your mom and I, that's the last thing we wanted you to do.
2371900	2375900	I'm really sorry about that, and she will be too, okay?
2375900	2378900	Why does this bad stuff always have to happen to me?
2378900	2382900	Well, bad stuff happens everywhere. Bad stuff happens to me all the time.
2382900	2385900	Yeah, but you cause it.
2394900	2397900	I know you're scared, you know. I know how you feel.
2397900	2399900	No, you don't.
2402900	2404900	I don't want to die at that.
2404900	2406900	Oh, come on, man. You're not going to die?
2406900	2409900	Even if you had cancer, which you don't, you do not have that.
2409900	2411900	It's a treatable kind, okay?
2417900	2419900	Hey, come on, come on.
2420900	2422900	We'll beat this thing, no matter what it is, you know?
2422900	2424900	I'm not letting anything happen to you.
2424900	2428900	This scene ends with Tim promising something he can't possibly deliver.
2428900	2433900	And in many ways, Randy feels like he's left fate and medicine to decide what happens next.
2433900	2437900	This being a very special episode on a sitcom, things end up working out by the end,
2437900	2444900	and we find out Randy doesn't have cancer, but instead a thyroid condition that can be treated with a daily pill.
2444900	2449900	The episode is pretty standard stuff, albeit with some questionable parenting from the tailors
2449900	2452900	keeping important medical information from their son.
2452900	2456900	It's most remembered, at least by me, for Thomas's performance,
2456900	2460900	one that would make me assume he had a bright future in the acting world ahead of him.
2460900	2465900	The reason we don't talk about Jonathan Taylor Thomas much these days is because in the early 2000s,
2465900	2467900	he stepped away from the world of Hollywood.
2467900	2472900	It wasn't the first time he chose to leave the spotlight, though, as we'll be seeing in a later season.
2478900	2483900	We saw some growth in these seasons as the boys start dealing with more adult problems,
2483900	2486900	like getting a part-time job or learning how to drive.
2486900	2491900	The show gradually shifts away from telling stories about becoming men and more about becoming adults,
2491900	2495900	albeit with some masculine coding thrown in here and there.
2495900	2500900	What's more interesting, though, is when Tim runs into examples of his old-fashioned manly advice getting out of hand,
2500900	2503900	and he effectively has to deprogram it out of his sons.
2503900	2509900	In the Season 6 episode, The Feminine Mistake, we find out Brad's girlfriend is waiting on him hand and foot.
2517900	2527900	And then we get hit with some bio truths.
2536900	2540900	One of the core concepts of the show is the confrontation between two ideas,
2540900	2543900	that men have biological urges that are tamed by society,
2543900	2547900	and that the definition of a man should be broader than this supposed biological truth.
2547900	2552900	The wisdom from Wilson in this one reveals that Wilson is apparently a feminist.
2574900	2579900	Wilson being a feminist is played for laughs, tellingly, because it's not something people would think about him.
2579900	2584900	Even if we'd grant Wilson his feminism stripes, he's talking about the movement from the 60s
2584900	2588900	and doesn't have much to say about feminism in the 90s, which is a completely different wave.
2588900	2590900	Things go worse with Brad.
2603900	2626900	Brad has to be yanked away from classic masculinity by Tim,
2626900	2630900	a change from Tim, who would typically try to reinforce it.
2630900	2633900	This episode is very much about how modern men understand feminism,
2633900	2636900	and can use it to correct behavior that exploits women.
2639900	2641900	He's still acting as a feminist here.
2641900	2644900	I'm going to use a term that I've been trying to avoid until now,
2644900	2647900	but I hope those of you in the audience who are resistant to it are ready.
2647900	2650900	This is an example of the danger of toxic masculinity,
2650900	2655900	and how men can be the best champions to protect the next generation from falling prey to it.
2655900	2659900	That's why traditional gender roles and norms need to be challenged.
2659900	2664900	And when someone argues to lock those norms into place and not let people violate them,
2664900	2667900	they're also arguing to retain this same toxicity.
2667900	2671900	The point is to hold onto the good and discard the bad,
2671900	2675900	and that can only be done by challenging what it means to be a man.
2675900	2679900	A couple of decades earlier, Brad's behavior would have seemed far less egregious,
2679900	2684900	but by questioning that norm, Angela is given the opportunity to be more than a sandwich dispenser,
2684900	2688900	and Brad is given the opportunity to not be a piece of trash.
2688900	2692900	Women can't be solely responsible for demanding respect from problematic men.
2692900	2696900	Men have to police each other too, particularly fathers raising sons.
2696900	2699900	Although Tim doesn't become entirely enlightened himself,
2699900	2704900	he does seem to understand that his attitudes towards women shapes the way his sons see them as well.
2704900	2711900	So it's not that Brad was defaulting to treating women like a servant because of some biological programming.
2711900	2715900	It was that he was raised to see women that way based on the behavior of his father,
2715900	2718900	and more broadly, the way women are seen in society.
2718900	2723900	In response to losing the boys to adulthood, Tim expresses wanting another child in
2723900	2728900	Say Good Night, Gracie, after spending the day watching his niece, Gracie.
2728900	2746900	Tim having spent much of his life raising boys is ready for a change,
2746900	2751900	and what I like about this episode is how caring for a girl allows him to broaden his perspective.
2751900	2755900	Tim felt like he had to be masculine for his boys, creating a feedback loop.
2755900	2758900	He emphasized his masculinity for their sake,
2758900	2763900	and his presumption of their need for a masculine figure made him dig deeper into that persona.
2763900	2767900	A daughter offers him the chance to access traits he would typically consider feminine,
2767900	2771900	letting Tim explore more of himself and who he can be.
2786900	2790900	This isn't to say that Tim wasn't always into masculine things before having boys,
2790900	2795900	but rather having to raise boys into men, he accessed that part of himself more frequently,
2795900	2800900	creating a cycle of behavior, where that behavior was continuously reinforced.
2800900	2803900	Also, this episode is a funny joke about Buzz Lightyear,
2803900	2808900	and it was around this time that Tim Allen played the character in the recently released Toy Story movie.
2808900	2819900	Somewhere behind the scene notes for season 6 and 7 was some controversy over Tim Allen being arrested for a DUI.
2819900	2826900	By controversy, I mean that audiences reacted to this news by continuing to watch the show.
2826900	2831900	Allen going to rehab at the end of season 7 similarly didn't seem to turn many people away.
2831900	2835900	It's strange how controversy just seemed to slide off Allen's back.
2835900	2840900	I have yet to speak at length about one of the most important characters in the show, Jill Taylor,
2840900	2845900	so let's right that wrong with a brief look at the small arc she went through in the show's seventh season.
2845900	2851900	In Room at the Top, we get our first real example of serious marital strife between Jill and Tim.
2851900	2857900	They fought constantly throughout the series, but this one got especially ugly with a couple fighting in front of their friends
2857900	2859900	and Tim ended up sleeping on the couch.
2859900	2864900	But things got much more fraught a few episodes later in Jill's Passion,
2864900	2869900	where she's tempted at the gym by a man named Ian, played by Tom Wabat.
2881900	2886900	Jill turns him down and there's no real harm done, but Jill catches herself having a dream about Ian later on,
2886900	2889900	which makes her think there's something wrong with her marriage.
2889900	2892900	What was nice about this episode was the resolution.
2917900	2919900	Actually, I blocked that moment out.
2920900	2925900	No, I had been really sick. This terrible, terrible flu.
2925900	2929900	And you passed up Laker tickets so you could stay home and take care of me.
2930900	2933900	Yeah. Well, I was young in love.
2935900	2941900	Big Climax is Tim and Jill taking the time to talk with one another throughout the night and reconnecting on a deeper level.
2941900	2946900	About 10 episodes later, though, Ian makes a return in Taking Jill for Granite,
2946900	2952900	where we find out Tim's hired Ian to work on the Taylor family's kitchen, specifically their granite countertops.
2953900	2958900	You know, when I got to your place this morning and you know we saw each other again,
2958900	2962900	I was afraid it was going to be just awfully uncomfortable all day long.
2963900	2964900	But it wasn't. Not at all.
2964900	2969900	No, it really wasn't. You know, we had a nice talk and a nice lunch and...
2970900	2976900	Tim's reaction is a bit mixed when he finds out his highly sought-after granite guy might be a bad dude.
2976900	2978900	Can you imagine what this will look like tomorrow?
2978900	2980900	Pretty much the same.
2982900	2984900	Why do you say something like that?
2984900	2985900	I fired Ian.
2987900	2990900	For a moment, though, I thought you said you fired my granite guy.
2991900	2994900	I did. When I gave him a lift home, he came on to me.
2995900	2997900	You fired the granite guy?
3000900	3003900	Did you hear what I said? He came on to me.
3003900	3004900	Oh, did you say he had a nice outfit or something?
3004900	3006900	He kissed me.
3010900	3011900	What did you do?
3011900	3013900	I pushed him away.
3013900	3014900	You should have fired him.
3014900	3015900	I did fire him.
3016900	3018900	You fired the granite guy?
3020900	3026900	Tim and Jill patch things up, of course, because as the earlier episodes helped establish, they have a strong marriage.
3026900	3029900	We even get a cute little gag for the closing credits.
3031900	3033900	Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
3037900	3038900	I...
3042900	3043900	I...
3047900	3048900	I...
3052900	3053900	Oh...
3056900	3057900	I...
3062900	3063900	Oh.
3067900	3068900	Ian.
3069900	3070900	Ian.
3071900	3072900	Ian.
3076900	3079900	But have you spotted the problem with my discussion about Jill?
3079900	3088900	Let's move on to From Top to Bottom, an episode where Jill is invited to be on a TV show panel to discuss what it's like to be a mother and a grad student at the same time.
3088900	3093900	Well, he comes up with all kinds of crazy ideas, like he wanted to buy and move up to a hunting lodge.
3093900	3094900	With the kids? The whole family?
3094900	3095900	Yeah, the whole family.
3095900	3097900	Oh, and he wanted to fly into outer space.
3097900	3099900	Oh, now that is crazy.
3099900	3106900	Oh, oh, oh, in the middle of writing my master's thesis, he decided he wanted to have another baby.
3107900	3108900	At your age?
3109900	3114900	Tim eventually forgives Jill because of the obvious double standard, combined with a less than compelling reason.
3115900	3120900	You got carried away. You're trying to show off with the girls? I was the buddy of Tyra.
3121900	3122900	Yeah, that's right. You got it.
3123900	3126900	I did all the time on Tool Time. Now I know how you feel.
3127900	3129900	So you're not going to hold this against me?
3130900	3132900	No, I'm a guy. I let this stuff go.
3133900	3138900	Most of Jill's problems in this series tend to come from her having issues related to Tim.
3138900	3141900	Well, once in a while, we might see Jill having fights with her sisters.
3141900	3155900	Jill-centered stories frequently included Tim in some capacity, whereas Tim-centric stories, while often including Jill, with some regularity, would relegate her to a supporting player, as opposed to being a central part of the conflict.
3155900	3160900	As interesting as Jill could be, she rarely steps outside the shadow of her husband.
3160900	3166900	Behind the scenes, Patricia Richardson often had to fight to give her character a more rounded life throughout the series.
3166900	3173900	I began to be frustrated with I had no friend. I had no job. I had no life outside of the house.
3174900	3180900	I never had a scene without Tim in it. I never had a scene alone with the children. I had never had a scene alone with Wilson.
3180900	3187900	I never had any place to go. I go, if they love me so much, then let's develop the character more and give me more to do.
3187900	3193900	But they love you! But then why don't you develop her? But they love you!
3193900	3202900	And as one last note before we hit the final season, if you're wondering why I haven't been talking about Al much, it's because I had to cancel him after he wore blackface this season.
3202900	3206900	Also, this video is really long and I needed to draw the line somewhere.
3206900	3211900	I should have said, cancel. Is that something? No, that's nothing.
3215900	3220900	One of the biggest changes to the series in this season was the exit of Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
3220900	3224900	He departed in the season's second episode, titled Adios.
3224900	3231900	I get to go to Costa Rica. What? Yeah, some guy dropped out of the program and they're giving me a spot.
3232900	3234900	Wait, they expect you to just pick up a ghost like that?
3234900	3240900	Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm going to be living with a family in San Ramon, which is only 20 miles from where Lauren lives. I leave on Saturday.
3240900	3247900	The in-show reason for Randy's leaving was the opportunity to spend a year in Costa Rica as part of an environmental study program.
3247900	3251900	At this point, Randy's has developed a very strong social conscience.
3251900	3256900	Bedford's the one who's out of line. I mean, they're sweeping their pollution problem under the rug so they can maximize her profits.
3257900	3261900	Let me tell you something. When you get older, you'll understand not everything is so cut and dried.
3261900	3266900	I understand right now, Dad. Good. You're taking the company line. You're a sell-out.
3266900	3272900	You called me a sell-out? Oh, yeah, Dad. I called you a sell-out, but then again, to be a sell-out, you'd have to have principles to begin with.
3273900	3280900	Although Tim and Jill don't want to see their teenage son leave, Tim in particular, they eventually acquiesce and Randy is allowed to go.
3280900	3287900	Thomas would return a few episodes later for a guest appearance on the episode titled Home for the Holidays, but he would not return for the series finale.
3287900	3298900	Behind the scenes, the reason for Jonathan Taylor Thomas' exit from the show was to focus on school, though some animosity was created between him and Tim Allen when Allen saw him performing in movies shortly after leaving.
3310900	3313900	Speaking in an interview years later, Thomas said,
3319900	3337900	The rest of Season 8 is a mishmash of subplots that feel like the show trying to find a new footing, like Al dating a millionaire, Tim's brother Marty moving into the Taylor home with his two daughters, and we got the only two-parter in the series, Love's Labor Lost, in which Jill has an emergency hysterectomy.
3337900	3341900	One thing that's particularly weird about this episode is how we learn about Jill's tumor.
3353900	3361900	Instead of being in the room when Jill finds out, we instead learn about it with Tim. It reinforces the point I made earlier about so much of Jill's story being told through the medium of Tim.
3361900	3372900	He is the star, so that's to be expected to a degree. I do wonder why that, even when it comes to having an operation, we can't let Jill be the focus of learning about her own condition.
3372900	3378900	The second part does give us this nice scene between Jill and her mother, who came to Detroit to take care of Jill.
3391900	3408900	It only took the show eight seasons to give us a clear example of a mother imparting wisdom to a daughter.
3408900	3416900	Previous episodes that included Jill's mother had more to do with their relationship rather than Jill's need for a positive mother figure in her life.
3416900	3428900	That might just be because Jill is a grown woman, making opportunities like this rare, although we seemed to get moments like this on the regular when we had Tim going to his father figure Wilson for advice.
3428900	3436900	Another interesting bit of trivia is that this season features two episodes directed by cast members, one by Patricia Richardson and one by Tim Allen.
3437900	3442900	Richardson's episode, Neighbors, isn't too remarkable, but I want to talk about Allen's briefly.
3442900	3450900	In Loose Lips and Freudian Slips, Jill is placed in a tough spot when she accidentally is caught making a snide comment about one of her professors.
3466900	3483900	The next time she sees that professor, she is in front of him defending her thesis.
3496900	3515900	Putting aside Jill's awkwardness, that thesis should sound pretty familiar if you've been paying attention to this video.
3515900	3523900	It seems Kim Flagg, the writer for this episode, has Jill writing a thesis that could substitute as a reading of the Home Improvement series itself.
3523900	3539900	In fact, the premise of this episode, where Jill's true thoughts are revealed in an unguarded moment where she makes fun of a man's comb-over, could similarly be mirroring what this episode is doing, revealing a critical reading of this show behind the guise of its usual silly antics.
3539900	3544900	Wilson's lines here are especially revealing, and it raises the question how to read the subtext here.
3554900	3557900	No, no, no, no, no. It's about a guy who loses his clothes in Newark.
3557900	3561900	Time funny stuff happens to him.
3561900	3564900	So, no, wait. What does this have to do with my thesis, son?
3564900	3570900	Well, my drama department wanted me to rewrite my play, but I was very passionate about walking naked.
3570900	3572900	So you refused to make any of the changes?
3572900	3577900	No, no, no. Quite the opposite. I caved in, rewrote the whole play. It was a big success.
3577900	3579900	You must have been thrilled.
3580900	3584900	No, I felt terrible, because I compromised the integrity of the play.
3584900	3587900	So you think that I should just stick to what I wrote originally?
3587900	3594900	You know, Jill, your name is going to be on that thesis forever. Shouldn't it represent something that you truly believe in?
3594900	3597900	Yes, it should.
3597900	3608900	This episode has a lot of meta-cues. It could be seen as undercutting the earlier example of the thesis reading, so maybe this whole episode is making fun of people like me, who read into things a bit too much.
3608900	3614900	The show resolves the plot with Jill rejecting the committee's notes and sticking to her original thesis.
3614900	3621900	In a way, the show feels like it's acknowledging that it shouldn't be more than its original premise, and maybe because of that, it needs to end.
3621900	3625900	I think it's very telling that this is the episode Tim Allen directed.
3625900	3633900	I think what he's expressing are his frustrations that this series is drifting away from its original stated premise, and that's the masculine response to feminism.
3633900	3638900	And as it drifts away from that premise, it's costing the show's voice its authenticity.
3638900	3644900	And that brings us to the final episode, a three-parter titled The Long and Winding Road.
3644900	3653900	Tool Time has a new producer, Morgan, and he changes the show to be more spectacle than Home Repair. More spectacle than usual, anyway.
3653900	3660900	Tim, frustrated with losing all his creative control of the show, decides to quit, and he's followed out the door by Allen Heidi.
3661900	3669900	If you're gonna turn this show into a three-ring circus, I might just quit. Sorry to lose you. You were a good man.
3671900	3677900	Meanwhile, Jill is offered a job as a counselor in Indiana, leading the tailors to a familiar question.
3677900	3681900	Okay, so Tim, should she take this job?
3681900	3682900	Absolutely.
3682900	3684900	The job's in Seattle.
3684900	3685900	Karen, this is stupid.
3685900	3692900	Okay, okay, let me ask you another question. Tool time goes national, but you have to move to New York. Do you go?
3692900	3698900	Yeah, it's my job. It'd be perfect... if it's okay with Jill.
3698900	3702900	Oh, so you're saying that your job is more important than hers?
3702900	3703900	She didn't have a job.
3703900	3707900	Answer the question, Tim. Do you move to New York or Seattle?
3707900	3709900	This might be a good time for you to support Jill.
3710900	3715900	The truth is, my family's always been based around me and my career.
3715900	3719900	I never really thought about what would happen if, you know...
3719900	3723900	You never thought you'd be making the same sacrifices for Jill as she did for you.
3723900	3725900	Yeah, that's right, yeah.
3726900	3731900	Although Tim is initially resistant to it, there isn't much discussion about the move.
3731900	3736900	She's got to move to Indiana for a job. I'm going to put on a moo-moo and curlers for her.
3737900	3739900	So, does this mean you're willing to discuss it now?
3739900	3742900	No need to. We're going.
3742900	3743900	Yeah.
3743900	3752900	I'm not too keen on that. Even though he's essentially siding with Jill here, this makes it look like the decision was still his, instead of there being any sort of discussion.
3752900	3758900	It's a bit incongruent, with an episode that's supposed to be about Tim learning to let someone else take the lead.
3758900	3765900	The second part of the finale is Tim driving Brad and Mark to school, which is an excuse to show off clips from some classic episodes.
3765900	3770900	The country music star Kenny Rogers recorded the song, We've Got It All, for this episode.
3770900	3775900	The story picks up again in the third part and final episode of Home Improvement.
3775900	3784900	Tim records the final episode of Tool Time with a bunch of guest stars, the episode gets huge ratings, and Morgan changes his mind, offering Tim big money to stay.
3784900	3787900	I've been trying to convince him to stay with Tool Time. He keeps turning me down.
3787900	3789900	He hated what you did to his show.
3789900	3796900	That's all changed since the last episode. We offered to make him the executive producer, and we offered to give him a big raise.
3796900	3800900	But he won't budge. Something about Indiana.
3800900	3803900	He turned you down because of my job offer?
3803900	3809900	Meanwhile, Al is getting married to his girlfriend Trudy in the Taylor backyard, a classic ending for a comedy.
3809900	3823900	By the power vested in me by the state of Michigan and the church of the celestial moon, I now pronounce you husband and wife.
3823900	3831900	I don't know why Wilson is some kind of celestial moon priest. In spite, or maybe because of that, the wedding goes off without a hitch.
3831900	3835900	But will Tim take the big money, or is he in jail moving to Indiana?
3835900	3839900	The moving dilemma is sort of addressed in the final scene.
3861900	3878900	Well, if we ever decide to move, maybe we wouldn't have to leave the house.
3878900	3887900	What does that mean?
3887900	3890900	Did they move? Or was that strictly Tim's fantasy?
3890900	3896900	The ending here is deliberately vague due to a disagreement between Tim Allen, Patricia Richardson, and the writers.
3896900	3904900	The writers were pushing for the Taylor's to move to Indiana, whereas Allen and Richardson were fighting for a less cliche ending, then turning the lights out on an empty home.
3904900	3909900	The ending we got was a compromise, and in many ways, that fits the show quite nicely.
3909900	3918900	It had settled itself to the idea that Tim would uproot his life for his wife in the first part of the finale, and now it was confronting the idea of Jill taking charge herself.
3918900	3932900	While I, as a viewer, might like to see Tim step aside, since it would symbolize Tim shedding his persona of masculine dominance, I'm not sure the show earned such a departure from the man we've been watching for eight seasons.
3932900	3937900	Tim Taylor grew throughout the series, definitely. But how radical has this change been?
3937900	3947900	The fact that he twisted Jill's decision into his own, shutting down the discussion on a move they would make as partners, suggests to me that he isn't ready to stop being the family patriarch just yet.
3947900	3954900	He'll bend, but only slightly. The vague ending suggests that this conversation isn't over.
3954900	3965900	The series finale was a massive rating success. It was the fifth highest rated series finale for the decade, and it captured 35.5% of American households that night.
3965900	3975900	The decision to end the show largely came from Tim Allen, who was creatively drained after eight seasons. He reportedly turned down an offer of $50 million for a new season of home improvement.
3975900	3983900	Patricia Richardson was also offered a huge paycheck to return, $25 million, though she took some issue with being paid half as much as Tim.
3983900	3990900	So Tim and I sat down and we said, there's no way to do the show anymore the way it is. Zach's graduating, he's moving, Jonathan's gone.
3990900	4001900	You know, the only way to do it is to totally change the show. We'd have to have them, like, you know, move away and open up a bed and breakfast somewhere or something or have Tim go back and teach shop.
4001900	4003900	I mean, that was one of the ideas we talked about.
4003900	4011900	The only way this is going to happen is you pay me exactly the money you pay him. We're total equals. You pay me exactly the money you pay him. We're executive producers.
4011900	4015900	I get, if you offer him $2 million an episode, you give me $2 million an episode. We're total equal. I don't do it.
4015900	4023900	Richardson's complaints were joined by similar ones from other cast members. And all that arguing played a role in Tim's decision to end the show.
4023900	4037900	I sat there and I thought about, can I do this again? Knowing Pat's concerns were just almost impossible to address. I just didn't want money to be the motivator. And it would have been.
4037900	4051900	Earl Hindman, who played Wilson, if you don't recognize his face, only took a few small roles after Home Improvement ended in 1999. His lifetime of smoking seems like the likely cause of his diagnosis of lung cancer in 2003.
4051900	4056900	He passed away on December 29th of the same year at the age of 61.
4056900	4066900	According to castmates and staff members of the show, Hindman was well-loved on the set, and notably one of the few actors who never made a fuss about their role, even though he was permanently behind a wooden fence.
4066900	4081900	This is a good place to restate. Hindman's performance as Wilson was excellent. Although I didn't particularly appreciate the character's point of view at times, Hindman delivered his lines with compassion and wisdom that you could really feel throughout its delivery.
4081900	4089900	The rest of the cast went on to have various levels of success, though it's safe to say that none of them were on as huge a hit as Home Improvement had been.
4089900	4106900	Though reportedly very friendly backstage, the remaining cast wasn't completely reunited until 2011 in a photo shoot for Entertainment Weekly. Tim Allen went on to star in Last Man Standing, a sitcom on ABC that's more or less Home Improvement, except raising three girls instead of three boys.
4106900	4118900	And instead of having a tool show, he sells sporting goods. The show also notably featured several small Home Improvement reunions, including appearances by Richard Karn, Patricia Richardson, and Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
4118900	4128900	Its reaction from critics has been lukewarm, but unlike Home Improvement, it hasn't been nearly as successful with viewers, peaking at 40th place in the overall ratings.
4128900	4141900	While Home Improvement had a theme that was fairly conservative, the political messaging in Last Man Standing is much more overt, such as having the Tim Allen character, Mike Baxter, be a Mitt Romney supporter in its second season.
4141900	4151900	I haven't discussed Home Improvement's political leanings as much because they're very implicit and not as overt, but it shouldn't surprise anyone at this point that Tim Allen is a fairly conservative guy.
4151900	4160900	So it's only natural that a show with his name on it reflects his worldview to some degree. And what we see throughout Home Improvement is a show that's at its core a conservative one.
4160900	4166900	Conservative in the reasonable sense, not in the reactionary, crypto-fascist sense.
4166900	4178900	Although it should be noted that Tim Allen has at times expressed his desire to use the N-word in his comedy, which for all our sakes thankfully has not happened.
4178900	4184900	Not that I have any love for Tim Allen, more that we don't really need more using the N-word.
4184900	4190900	People love to complain about shows being political, and I can get on board with complaints of messaging being clumsy or ham-fisted.
4190900	4203900	But part of this lookback at Home Improvement has, I hope, highlighted how politics, or more specifically the social relationships between men and women, can be seen as a central theme regardless of any political party or policy being mentioned.
4203900	4208900	Politics, even how they shape our interpersonal lives, are always present.
4208900	4213900	Home Improvement was not a feminist show by any stretch, but was it an anti-feminist show?
4214900	4230900	At its core, I'd argue no. While it scratches its head at basic feminism concepts like a woman getting a job, it doesn't present it as something negative, more as something that is confusing, and it certainly doesn't fall into the trap of portraying feminism as something destructive.
4230900	4244900	It tries, oftentimes clumsily, to debate the merits of feminism and how it applies to men. And to its credit, it does seat some ground, acknowledging that feminism can be a positive thing for men, even though it backs away from using the word itself.
4244900	4253900	Also a part of Home Improvement are the many implicit assumptions that keep it from reflecting a modern conception of manhood. That is to say, modern in the year 2019.
4254900	4267900	As I said earlier, Home Improvement featured no gay men, very few men of color, and only vaguely refers to trans men. This creates a show that represents a very specific viewpoint, the white hetero cis male.
4267900	4279900	And that should be noted as an observation, not a criticism. Watching Home Improvement now felt very much like watching an old show, and why a show like Home Improvement in the present would feel even more archaic.
4279900	4287900	The idea of a Home Improvement reboot was something Tim Allen was considering in 2018, when it looked like The Last Man Standing was going to be cancelled by ABC.
4287900	4297900	With many of its cast members on board and reboots being so fashionable, it would have been a sure thing, had Last Man Standing not suddenly been picked up by Fox, where it was renewed for a few more seasons.
4297900	4303900	It's possible that reboot might still happen one day, but as for the time being, Allen seems content with his current sitcom.
4303900	4315900	Home Improvement is very much an old guard show. It's a show from the past, created in the 90s, signaling a dying breed with an archaic grunt. If it was old-fashioned then, it feels even older now.
4315900	4331900	And to call it apolitical would be a mistake, because the act of advocating for the status quo, or the past, even when you're eschewing politics, still has implicit in it a political stance, and this show is clearly making a stand for the patriarchy.
4331900	4339900	Acknowledging some positive points of feminism, but never completely abandoning the idea that men are the driving force within the world.
4339900	4348900	This show felt to me like watching something finely crafted, with some humour and heart, but ultimately a relic.
4348900	4363900	This one took way longer to produce than I expected. I'd like to give a special thank you to the YouTube channel SJW Debates. He helped me out with some of the humour theory for this video.
4363900	4372900	Anyone unfamiliar with his channel should absolutely check it out. Also, of course, many thanks to my patrons, whose names are floating up the screen now.
4372900	4382900	If you'd like to be a patron and have your name on the credits, and maybe something more, if I ever think up more patron rewards, you can go to my Patreon. It's linked below.
4382900	4387900	I'm getting very close to releasing a bonus video where I sing, and it's not going to be that great.
4387900	4397900	If you would like more of me and my loveliness, you can follow me on Twitter. I also have a curious cat where you can fire off a few questions.
4397900	4404900	And obviously, obviously, do I need to say it? Yes, I need to say it. Like, comment, and if you haven't already, subscribe.
4404900	4408900	Thanks for watching.
