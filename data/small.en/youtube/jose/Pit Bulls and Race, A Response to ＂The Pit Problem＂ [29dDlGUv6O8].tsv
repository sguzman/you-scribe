0	3840	What do you think of when someone mentions a pitbull?
3840	8280	Do vaguely suspicious images like these come into your mind?
8280	13680	If you're like me, and most other people, someone put those images in there.
13680	18240	In recent weeks, certain folks on Twitter have been pushing an anti-pitbull narrative
18240	22680	that's filled with half-truths, bad research, and lots of other fear-mongering.
22680	27080	If you've been following the news about pitbulls over the last few decades, you might
27080	31240	think they've co-opted a legitimate controversy around the pitbull.
31240	34840	But the stigma attached to pitbulls go deeper than that.
34840	40520	This new wave of anti-pitbull rhetoric is tired garbage, cosmetically altered with minimal
40520	41760	effort.
41760	46120	Which brings me to this video by Brittany Venti, The Pit Problem.
46120	51160	While going through this video, I'll spare you any and all images of animals or children
51160	52600	being mauled.
52600	57240	If you're interested in checking out Venti's video, be warned, it has a lot of that in
57240	60320	there and it literally just goes right into it, no warning.
60320	62480	So here's that warning for you.
62480	66060	Like all great thought leaders, Brittany Venti was motivated to make this video after she
66060	69240	saw a sign on a truck and some memes posted on the internet.
69240	74520	I never really thought about doing a video until now, and I think now is the perfect
74520	76040	time to do so.
76040	81040	There's trucks driving around New York with LCD screens saying to ban pitbulls, and Petco
81080	84920	just banned pitbulls from playing with other pets at their stores.
84920	89920	And I've seen a lot of anti-pitbull memes in the past few months.
98640	103800	Pitbulls, like she sort of mentions in her video, were bred from bulldogs.
103800	109180	Bulldogs were originally bred in England for the hideous sport of bullbaiting.
109180	114100	This involved tying a bull, or sometimes a bear, to a post and having several dogs
114100	117820	maul it to death, or die in the attempt.
117820	120700	The sport was banned in 1835.
120700	126060	With bullbaiting banned, these dogs were sadly conscripted into another blood sport, that
126060	127260	of dogfighting.
127260	131340	The breeding pressure now shifted over to producing dogs that would be aggressive towards
131340	132340	other dogs.
132340	134540	So, the pitbull was born.
134540	139140	A little known fact is that the majority of dog breeds were created in the 19th century,
139140	144180	and often represented the interests or desire of the upper classes of a given society.
144180	148740	Particularly wealthy individuals would breed dogs, because they could easily afford it,
148740	153820	to generate specific characteristics or traits, or even just physical appearances that they
153820	154660	liked.
154660	160300	Once a dog no longer had any purpose to the upper class, or just was no longer popular,
160300	164840	it would often be discarded and fall in with the less discriminating lower classes.
164840	167420	This is what happened to the pitbull.
167420	171620	Although the pitbull was still used for dogfighting, the vast majority of pitbulls tended to be
171620	175420	family pets and were no longer being bred for blood sports.
175420	180140	Its formerly purebred genes have had well over a century of mixing to dilute the breeding
180140	181700	done to it in the 19th century.
181700	185740	It's also important to know that when people refer to pitbulls, that term includes at least
185740	188380	four distinct breeds and several mixes.
188380	193420	Also, boxers, aquitas, and sharpes were all historically bred for fighting too, but they
193420	196620	don't get portrayed as dangerous the way pitbulls are.
196620	200740	So when people like Brittany Venti talk about their breeding history to paint pitbulls as
200740	204740	inherently dangerous, it's fear mongering, plain and simple.
204740	208780	And the pitbull's story doesn't end in the 19th century, but let's return to the video
208780	216620	before talking about the pitbull in 20th century America.
216620	218980	Venti tries to explain dog breeding by saying,
218980	223900	It's just a natural instinct that has been selectively bred by breeders.
223900	225900	Dogs are going to do what they were bred to do.
225900	229900	Some dogs are meant for herding, some dogs are meant for hunting, and then some dogs
229900	230900	are meant for herding.
230900	235660	What I think she's trying to get across here, the English language be damned, is that she
235660	240620	is a big believer in genetics driving behaviour, and that a dog bred for a purpose is tied
240620	245180	to that purpose, as its genes will only allow for that limited range of behaviour selected
245180	247060	by a breeder.
247060	251020	While traits can definitely be passed on to other dogs through breeding, without that
251020	254940	continued selection pressure, traits can often fall out of favour.
254940	260180	Evolution doesn't stamp a finished label on any species, and some breeders have found
260180	264620	pitbulls can lose their aggression within two to three generations, a milestone that the
264620	267300	vast majority of pitbulls have lived past as.
267300	272460	And this may come as a surprise to Brittany, very few pitbulls are bred to be fighting dogs.
272460	275980	But Brittany Venti isn't interested in that, and this video isn't about representing
275980	281180	science, it's about getting you to believe that genes are what dictate behaviour.
281180	284700	Pitbulls are the most dangerous dog, I'm referring to not only pitbulls, but their
284700	287820	variations and any mixtures of them.
287820	292140	The mixtures are even more dangerous because sometimes you won't even know it's a pitbull.
292140	294820	Okay, let's think this through.
294820	301660	If pitbull genes make a dog violent, why would mixing those genes make a dog less violent?
301660	306340	It's almost as if she's saying pitbulls will taint any other breed they're allowed to mix
306340	307640	with.
307680	311400	I wonder what that would sound like if she were talking about human beings for a moment.
311400	315360	But right now I'm just reading subtext, Venti clearly said the danger was because people
315360	319840	wouldn't know the dog is half pitbull, it's almost as if she's saying the onus is on people
319840	324720	and how they treat dogs, but hey hey, I'm just picking on her poor presentation skills
324720	325720	now.
325720	329000	There are actual bits of research that are shown throughout this video, all found on
329000	331440	that noted academic journal, Twitter.
331440	338320	The highlighted captions all come from Twitter user wildgoose999, some Twitter person who
338320	340840	hides behind a bird avatar.
340840	342640	What kind of jerk does that, right?
342640	345400	Let's drill down on a few of the specific claims made by this guy.
345400	349440	To keep this video reasonable in its length, I'm going to pass over some of the irrelevant
349440	354120	ones, such as groups trying to change the name of pitbulls, thinly sourced claims about
354120	360160	pitbull advocates being cigarette shills, or that pro-pitbull groups are secret satanists.
360160	364080	Because none of those have anything to do with the supposed threat of pitbulls, and
364080	369040	I don't want to waste time on them in the video, although the satanism one was hilariously
369040	370040	not true.
370040	374380	First, there's this little graph that points out that Michael Vick's conviction is some
374380	376880	kind of catalyst for pitbull attacks.
376880	380700	For those who may not remember, Michael Vick is a former pro-football player who operated
380700	383400	a dog fighting ring that killed a number of pitbulls.
383400	389240	What the graph is suggesting is that pro-pitbull sentiment that came as a reaction to the story
389240	395200	has made the public friendlier to pitbulls, and therefore more vulnerable to attacks.
395200	398120	The numbers on this graph are compiled from this dataset.
398120	403920	Now, the big problem with this dataset is that it is made up entirely from media reports.
403920	409160	It's not an actual measure of dog bites across the US, but rather the ones reported by the
409160	410160	media.
410160	414800	The growth in anti-pitbull sentiment was heavily fueled by media coverage in the 1980s about
414800	418680	pitbulls being out of control, and this has more or less been an old standard for local
418680	420760	news reports across the US.
420760	431120	The dataset also suggests dog bites are exploding, going from 731 in 2002 to 2975 in 2013.
431120	435040	What if we compare this to a neutral data source for a better measure, though?
435040	444360	According to the CDC, using data from hospitals across the United States, in 2001, 368,245
444360	447080	people were admitted to a hospital for dog bites.
447080	452560	So if we assume the total number of dog bites stayed the same in 2002, or let's even round
452560	459120	it down to 360,000, the total number of bites reported in the media represent 0.2% of all
459120	460120	dog bites.
460120	464040	I should also point out that this bit of research wasn't peer-reviewed or published anywhere,
464040	470200	but on the website animals247.org, created by the paper's author Merritt Clifton, a
470200	472200	long-time anti-pitbull advocate.
472200	477880	He has no serious academic history or credentials, and his research has largely been popularized
477880	483920	by the very slick-looking dogsbite.org sitting along blog posts like this one.
483920	488480	And that's not exactly what I would call a constructive criticism of the scientific
488480	489480	literature.
489480	493400	There's a great blog post that drills into the numbers of Clifton's pitbull attack stats
493400	498320	and how they often count ridiculous stories such as a horse kicking a woman after it was
498320	502440	startled by a pitbull or an animal control officer slipping and falling while chasing
502440	505640	a dog as pitbull attacks.
505640	509920	Give it a read if you want to hear some of the more ridiculous claims.
509920	514640	These slides throw out some damning numbers, but here are two things to keep in mind.
514640	519520	These all relate to specific communities and not national averages, and they compare singular
519520	524320	breeds with a number of different pitbull breeds blended into a single stat.
524320	528960	The last of the tweets Brittany Venti cites for her video is a thread where Wildgoose999
528960	532940	discusses how it's the genetics of the pitbull that create aggressive behavior and that owners
532940	534580	have nothing to do with it.
534580	540280	The first slide is from Dogbites and Urban Children, published in Pediatrics in 1991.
540280	543660	The first limitation of this paper is that it looks at dogbites reported in a single
543660	548760	Philadelphia hospital in 1989, so again, you can't always generalize one community to
548760	550040	an entire country.
550040	553840	The next problem we run into is the actual data in the research.
553840	557640	This table here breaks down the number of bites by breed, and we can see that pitbulls
557640	559400	actually weren't the most common.
559400	561200	It was the German Shepherd.
561200	565440	The paper's discussion section where the excerpt is taken from does go into detail
565440	570400	about pitbulls, but the two paragraphs shown by Wildgoose999 are less connected than he
570400	571640	might have you think.
571640	576400	The second paragraph isn't really about pitbulls specifically, but dogs in general.
576400	580960	The idea that genetic differences influence behavior is a controversial one, but a tie
580960	584520	that influenced to breed is the shell game that's being played here.
584520	586840	Why is the only term highlighted?
586840	588720	Genetic predisposition.
588720	593160	The other factors of early socialization to people, training or maltreatment, quality
593160	597520	of care and supervision, and behavior of the victim are also factors.
597520	602840	Wildgoose999 is arguing that a pitbull's behavior isn't relevant to the actions of its owner,
602840	607240	but the non-highlighted variables would be influenced by a dog's upbringing and environment.
607240	612440	The paper is clear that the other variables are at least as important, so why emphasize
612440	614240	genes?
614240	619240	Possibly because Wildgoose999 has an agenda here, and he's willing to twist the research
619240	621240	to get that across.
621240	622680	Let's move on to the next one.
622680	629440	Mortality, mauling, and maiming by vicious dogs, published in 2011 in Annals of Surgery.
629440	635640	Now the quote Wildgoose999 uses is actually not from the paper he's citing.
635640	640520	The Annals of Surgery paper is actually quoting someone from a different paper here, so let's
640520	642160	go to that one.
642160	650720	Dog attacks, deaths, and maimings, U.S. and Canada, September 1982 to December 31st, 2013
650720	651720	by...
651720	654960	Oh, it's our old friend Merritt Clifton.
654960	660440	In fact, this paper is the same dataset I debunked earlier.
660440	665120	And if you look through the Annals of Surgery paper, it actually cites all kinds of research
665120	671080	from dogbites.org and other bits of spurious research from Clifton that hasn't been peer
671080	672080	reviewed.
672080	677160	It even includes a YouTube video as one of its sources, so technically I guess my video
677160	679900	here has just as much academic weight.
679900	683920	This makes me question how careful these researchers were in putting together this paper, but I'll
683920	688280	be as charitable as possible here and say, perhaps they're seeing something in Clifton's
688280	690160	work that I'm not.
690160	692720	Their paper closes with this passage.
692720	697120	These breeds should be regulated in the same way in which other dangerous species such
697120	699360	as leopards are regulated.
699360	704440	I'm not sure pit bulls should be considered as dangerous as leopards, but they're the
704440	706920	scientists I guess.
706920	711960	Slides 3 through 8 all come from a paper titled, Are Pit Bulls Different?, an analysis
711960	718720	of the Pit Bull Terrier controversy published in 1987 in Anthrozoos, a multidisciplinary
718720	722960	journal of the interactions of people and animals.
722960	729040	All these points come from the same section of the paper, but even in these selected sections,
729040	732240	Wild Goose 999's intentions are betrayed.
732240	736840	The first slide reads, A long history of breeding for bullbaiting and fighting has had a profound
736840	740440	effect on the genetic predisposition of many of the fighting breeds.
740440	744320	In many cases, a shorter history of selection for qualities that might make these animals
744320	748400	suitable as household companions has counteracted this effect.
748400	754000	Why highlight the genetic predisposition and ignore the rest of that passage?
754000	759120	Aside from the fact that it basically contradicts everything you're trying to say in your little
759120	760400	Twitter thread.
760400	765000	The other slides are similarly irresponsible and do little to represent the actual findings
765000	766000	of the paper.
766000	769760	If I wanted to cherry pick something that showed fighting dogs were no risk to humans,
769760	772880	I could just post this from the next page.
772880	774440	Aggression towards people.
774440	779400	The fighting dogs of the 19th century generally posed little or no threat to people.
779400	783320	These animals were disqualified in the pit if they exhibited aggression to their handlers
783320	785360	or other people.
785360	789320	Early in this century, several former fighting breeds such as the Bull Terrier and the English
789320	794160	Bulldog were specifically selected for their good dispositions around people.
794160	798160	But what is this paper really about, and what argument is it truly making?
798160	802800	We can find that easily enough at the end of the paper where it says, problems of irresponsible
802800	806920	ownership are not unique to pit bulls, nor will they be in the future.
806920	811800	For this reason, we feel that effective animal control legislation must emphasize responsible
811800	816760	and humane ownership of sound animals, as well as responsible supervision of children
816760	819080	and animals when they interact.
819080	823900	So this paper isn't about the evils of pit bulls, but instead advocating for owners
823900	827420	to be held to a higher level of responsibility.
827420	833300	It doesn't seem like a good paper to use in a thread about how owners don't matter
833300	835420	when it comes to pit bull aggression.
835420	842140	The last three slides all come from Dog Bites to Humans, Demography, Epidemiology, Injury
842140	847100	and Risk, published in 2001 in Vet Med Today.
847100	851820	This paper isn't really about pit bulls specifically, but dog bites in general.
851820	855900	Less favorable traits could mean anything when talking about all dogs.
855900	861460	To get more specific, a few paragraphs later the paper says, investigations of unpredictable
861460	866260	aggression have produced no firm results regarding heritability.
866260	870060	The next slide is a bit vague, but you might be interested to know that this comes from
870060	875740	a section titled, Issues of Fact and Myth, and the spot he cut off goes on to read, A
875740	880100	Careful Reading of the Literature supports three conclusions regarding breed.
880100	884400	The breeds most represented in dog bite data vary over time.
884400	889160	Breeds most often represented in published data are popular ones, and no one breed may
889160	893920	be represented in bite data in proportion to its actual population.
893920	899080	And pit bull is often applied without biological basis to a range of dog types, regardless
899080	901880	of the underlying genetic stock.
901880	906680	So the paper is pretty clear in stating that the pit bull stigma isn't because they're
906680	908680	genetically bad dogs.
908680	912720	And the last slide is, surprise surprise, also misleading.
912720	917240	Being just a few lines above it, we can see a fuller use of the text reads, caution is
917240	923560	urged regarding any generalization about inappropriate breed-specific behaviors.
923560	927360	Selection for specific behaviors should be viewed as a risk assessment analysis.
927360	931920	Breeds that have been selected for one or few specific behaviors may be more at risk
931920	936040	for developing undesirable variations on those behaviors.
936040	941040	This excerpt comes from a much larger section that, again, isn't specifically about pit
941040	943120	bulls, but dogs in general.
943120	947240	At best, you can try to connect this to how pit bulls may have been bred to be more aggressive
947240	952040	to other dogs, but this part of the paper is a discussion of where more research needs
952040	955040	to be done to minimize future dog bites.
955040	960040	It's not saying anything about the relative danger posed by pit bulls.
960040	965180	Phew, so all the garbage in that thread has been dealt with.
965180	969600	It's incredibly difficult to track which dogs are responsible for dog bites, as most people
969600	973000	aren't typically trained to identify dog breeds.
973000	976860	Even people who work at animal shelters often mistake dog breeds.
976860	982040	Most reports of dog bites, particularly in the media, but even in scientific literature,
982040	985240	can mistake what breed a dog might actually be.
985240	987280	Here are some pictures to give you an example.
987280	991800	Can you tell which one of these is the American Pit Bull Terrier?
991800	995320	That's one of the four distinct breeds.
995320	1000500	And don't worry, none of the other pictures are of the other three distinct pit bull breeds.
1000500	1003600	If you want to think this over a bit, you should hit pause on the video, because I'm
1003600	1005880	going to give you exactly no seconds for that.
1005880	1006880	It's this one right here.
1006880	1012280	There's even a whole paper on pit bull owners lying by omission about their dog breeds to
1012280	1013360	other people.
1013360	1017200	They pretend that their dog isn't bull-blooded, so they're also pretending that their dog
1017200	1022220	isn't more powerful than other dogs by a long stretch and are more likely to attack.
1022220	1025200	That's a very dangerous scheme to play, pit owners.
1025200	1030360	Brittany Venti brings up a paper titled Managing the Stigma of Outlaw Breeds, a case study
1030360	1035280	of pit bull owners, published in Society and Animals in 2000.
1035280	1039760	It discusses how pit bull owners often lie to others about their dog in order to avoid
1039760	1041980	the stigma placed on pit bulls.
1041980	1046780	The paper explicitly says owners do this not because their dogs are dangerous, but because
1046780	1049880	of the social stigma attached to them.
1049880	1051800	Here's a quick excerpt from the paper.
1051800	1056820	Our work suggests that non-human animals also can be stigmatized, although they will
1056820	1059820	not have a conscious awareness of this perception.
1059820	1065020	However, as part of a human animal team, their owners can experience the taintedness that
1065020	1069940	is commensurate with this stigmatization and resort to various techniques to mitigate,
1069940	1074380	prevent, or improve such adverse perceptions.
1074380	1080500	Another source Brittany uses is the what to expect if your community is discussing breed-specific
1080500	1083580	legislation, BSL in brackets.
1083580	1088640	Which isn't actually scientific research, but a set of instructions from an advocacy
1088640	1093940	group to a municipal government thinking of passing breed-specific legislation.
1093940	1097880	It's not peer-reviewed, there is no record of where it was published, or even who the
1097880	1099580	author is.
1099580	1104020	That's the bare minimum of what you need for something to even look like a proper scientific
1104020	1105020	source.
1105020	1109300	You may as well just use some asshole's random Twitter account as a source.
1109300	1113580	The video ends with Venti reading some shitty memes, selling merch, and then advocating
1113580	1115060	for breed-specific legislation.
1115060	1118860	So you guys might be asking, what's the solution to the pit problem?
1118860	1122020	The first solution is to just ban pit bulls.
1122020	1125620	Some places have already done this and it is an effective way to prevent a lot of the
1125620	1127500	dog maulings that happen.
1127500	1131100	There's actually a GoFundMe for that if you guys wish to support it.
1131100	1136140	The CDC and the American Veterinary Medical Association are both against breed-specific
1136140	1140420	legislation, citing there is no scientific evidence to support it.
1140420	1144620	BSL laws in the UK were shown to have no real effect on the number of dog bites that led
1144620	1150740	to hospital admissions, and in my hometown of Toronto, dog bites actually went up after
1150740	1152820	pit bulls were banned.
1152820	1156900	Results vary by community, but it does show how this legislation is often misguided, and
1156900	1160700	the money put towards its enforcement might be more effectively used in teaching owners
1160700	1162780	how to take care of their dogs.
1162780	1167940	And darker still, dogs that are seized as part of BSL laws are impounded, and many of
1167940	1170060	them are eventually euthanized.
1170060	1176140	But you might be wondering, why is some low-grade conservative making a video about pit bulls?
1176140	1183740	I hinted at elements of racism early on, and please no one hate me for this pun, but this
1183740	1185660	video is a dog whistle.
1185660	1187100	This guy in the comments heard it.
1187100	1193380	This dog whistle is being employed by race realists, also known as racists, to propagate
1193380	1198260	the idea that genetics are what drive behavior, and that if we can measure bad behavior in
1198260	1202740	a specific group, it must be a product of their genes.
1202740	1207420	In other words, they want you to believe that pit bulls are naturally cruel and dangerous,
1207420	1211340	so you'll believe that black people, or any people of color overrepresented in crime
1211340	1215020	statistics are naturally cruel and dangerous too.
1215020	1219700	The connection between pit bulls and peoples of color is just a nice way to synergize those
1219700	1227620	two things.
1227620	1231100	Here's the rest of the pit bulls story I brought up in the beginning of the video.
1231100	1234700	In the first half of the 20th century, there was a surge in love for the pit bull in the
1234700	1235820	United States.
1235820	1240100	The working class of the country took very fondly to pit bulls, not having the high price
1240100	1245180	tag of purebreds and fitting in nicely with the idea of the tough working class.
1245180	1248860	Pit bulls were beloved family pets and minor celebrities across the country.
1248860	1254940	A notable example is the pit bull terrier, Sergeant Stubby, who served in World War I.
1254940	1258540	Things were growing great for pit bulls for a few decades, but something changed in the
1258540	1260500	1970s and 80s.
1260500	1265420	Guard dogs and dog fighting had become increasingly common, and so, increasingly common in the
1265420	1270340	media were reports of dog bites and stories of dog fighting rings.
1270340	1274500	Guard dogs were popular with Americans who felt they needed protection local law enforcement
1274500	1277140	couldn't, or wouldn't, offer.
1277140	1281700	This often included the urban poor as pit bulls were relatively common and far less
1281700	1285660	expensive than purebreds that cost hundreds of dollars.
1285660	1289580	Pit bulls became popular with dog fighters for similar reasons.
1289580	1293740	While the vast majority of pit bulls weren't tossed into fighting pits, the ones that were
1293740	1298100	became prominent fixtures in press coverage, and this is where the myth of the vicious
1298100	1300500	pit bull really begins.
1300500	1304700	Stories of pit bull attacks, while not necessarily statistically higher than other breeds of
1304700	1310380	dogs, were frequently seen in newspapers, and once this reputation was created, anyone
1310380	1314220	who might need a vicious dog would be more inclined to get a pit bull and to raise it
1314220	1315540	up as such.
1315540	1320380	This created a cycle that got worse in the 1980s when the war on drugs began.
1320380	1324180	Pit bulls were increasingly associated in media narratives with drug dealers, using
1324180	1330580	them as vicious protectors and drug dealers in the 1980s in the minds of a white suburban
1330580	1334500	readership or black or hispanic.
1334500	1339460	Pit bulls, by proxy, got saddled with the racism that was targeted at their owners,
1339460	1345300	and while some dog breeds, such as Dobermans and St. Bernards, have weathered negative
1345300	1350660	public opinions after a few stories about bites, the association with drugs and some
1350660	1363020	good old-fashioned racism gave pit bulls a stigma that wouldn't fade so easily.
1363020	1367660	A recent news article uncovered some examples of how alt-right posters on 4chan are trying
1367660	1373020	to push the pit bull meme to advance their usual racist narrative, and certain enablers,
1373020	1376260	like Brittany Venti, are all too happy to help them along.
1376260	1381720	Now I don't know for sure if Brittany Venti herself is a racist, I'm not really that
1381720	1386660	familiar with her work to be honest, but she certainly is being used by them to advance
1386660	1388140	a narrative.
1388140	1393300	That makes this video deeply irresponsible and dangerously misleading.
1393300	1396420	The story of the pit bull does have an important lesson.
1396420	1401100	Genes are undoubtedly a part of our behavior, but social influences like breeding pressure
1401100	1404420	don't create meaningful lasting changes.
1404420	1408580	All animals are a product of their environment and how their genes interact with it.
1408580	1413540	So instead of treating a dog like a public menace, treat them with love and compassion.
1413540	1417700	And don't let dog discrimination be your gateway into thinking that people who don't look like
1417700	1419620	you are genetically inferior.
