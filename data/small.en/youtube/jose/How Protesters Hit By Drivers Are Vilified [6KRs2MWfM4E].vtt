00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
This video includes discussion of people being hit, and in some cases killed, by cars.

00:04.880 --> 00:09.440
I won't be using any footage or images of people being hit, but some of the discussion

00:09.440 --> 00:11.480
will get intense.

00:11.480 --> 00:23.800
On July 4th, on the I-5 freeway in Seattle, Washington, two Black Lives Matter protesters,

00:23.800 --> 00:28.840
Summer Taylor and Diaz Love, were hit by a car that had driven through their protest.

00:28.840 --> 00:32.480
The collision killed Taylor and left Love with critical injuries.

00:32.480 --> 00:38.120
The driver, DeWitt Kalit, was charged with vehicular homicide, vehicular assault, and

00:38.120 --> 00:39.440
reckless driving.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.640
The I-5 freeway had been shut down by police at the time, as it had over the previous 19

00:43.640 --> 00:46.860
days protests that had also taken place on the freeway.

00:46.860 --> 00:51.140
Police suspect the driver entered the I-5 freeway from an exit ramp along Stewart Street.

00:51.140 --> 00:55.280
He would then have needed to perform a U-turn and driven roughly one quarter of a mile before

00:55.280 --> 00:57.200
reaching the protesters.

00:57.240 --> 01:02.280
As the driver approached the 30 or so protesters, he drove around the two cars set up as barricades

01:02.280 --> 01:04.200
and then hit both Taylor and Love.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.420
The collision occurred at roughly 1.40 am.

01:07.420 --> 01:10.920
After the collision, the driver slowed his car before driving off when several of the

01:10.920 --> 01:12.620
other protesters approached him.

01:12.620 --> 01:14.680
He was later arrested by police.

01:14.680 --> 01:19.120
The driver reportedly was not intoxicated at the time, according to a field test performed

01:19.120 --> 01:23.780
by police, but in court documents it was stated that he was dealing with an untreated addiction

01:23.780 --> 01:29.700
issue involving Percocet, a substance that appears to be crystal meth, and several implements

01:29.700 --> 01:34.140
commonly used to smoke illegal substances were found in his car.

01:34.140 --> 01:38.260
According to police, the driver expressed concern for the well-being of the two people

01:38.260 --> 01:39.260
he hit.

01:39.260 --> 01:43.380
Kalit's lawyer has claimed that there was nothing political about the incident.

01:43.380 --> 01:47.820
With the most charity I can muster, this could be considered an incident of reckless driving,

01:47.820 --> 01:52.860
possibly under the influence of drugs, leading to the death and severe injury of two people.

01:52.860 --> 01:57.180
As someone looking at the evidence, it's difficult to ascribe any specific attempt

01:57.180 --> 01:58.180
to Kalit.

01:58.180 --> 02:02.060
According to the individual who first published video of this incident to Twitter and who

02:02.060 --> 02:06.380
was a witness at the scene, the driver was acting deliberately.

02:06.380 --> 02:08.700
But something else happened after this horrific moment.

02:08.700 --> 02:13.420
The footage of the accident went viral, and an apparatus of conservative spin kicked into

02:13.420 --> 02:14.500
gear.

02:14.500 --> 02:18.900
After the footage of the collision was posted to Twitter, the tweet was spread by Ian Miles

02:18.900 --> 02:19.900
Chong.

02:19.900 --> 02:23.740
He made a series of tweets claiming the protesters were responsible for getting hit.

02:23.740 --> 02:28.140
It is illegal to block an interstate, plain and simple.

02:28.140 --> 02:32.420
Police say that the driver involved in the Seattle I-5 hit is being interviewed and will

02:32.420 --> 02:36.120
likely be charged with aggravated assault and a hit and run.

02:36.120 --> 02:39.820
But the fault is of the protesters for blocking the interstate.

02:39.820 --> 02:43.200
He also went on to spread misinformation about the incident.

02:43.200 --> 02:47.080
The two people who got hit look like they ran back into the path of the car after it

02:47.080 --> 02:50.100
swerved to the left to avoid the other protesters.

02:50.100 --> 02:51.520
Why the hell?

02:51.520 --> 02:55.080
The problem with the protest group, and you can watch the full two-hour livestream, is

02:55.080 --> 02:59.040
that they moved on to the freeway without informing the police about their whereabouts,

02:59.040 --> 03:03.740
so police couldn't properly seal off the area because they received little notice.

03:03.740 --> 03:07.360
Not only were police aware, they had barricaded entrances to the freeway.

03:07.360 --> 03:12.620
These protests on the I-5 had been going on for 19 days, and according to this tweet,

03:12.620 --> 03:15.960
they had closed the highway nearly two hours before the incident.

03:15.960 --> 03:19.860
Ian, like some other people we'll be looking at, is determined to present a version of

03:19.860 --> 03:25.120
events where a driver who sees cars parked on a freeway surrounded by a group of 30 people

03:25.120 --> 03:30.240
has no expectation of even slowing down to a safe speed while passing.

03:30.240 --> 03:34.200
We saw similar takes from our dear friend in a beanie, Tim Pool.

03:34.200 --> 03:38.320
Sad to see anyone lose their life, we need to do better to teach our kids not to hang

03:38.320 --> 03:42.700
out on interstate highways at night while wearing all black around a curve and with

03:42.700 --> 03:45.680
vehicles blocking view of you and your friends.

03:45.680 --> 03:50.800
Hopefully Tim gave us a video to offer some more nuance to his position.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.240
At night, wearing all black.

03:54.240 --> 03:58.880
Several protesters dressed in non-black outfits are clearly visible, and Summer Taylor, seen

03:58.880 --> 04:02.160
right here, is clearly not wearing an all-black outfit.

04:02.160 --> 04:05.920
Also, there are, like, 30 people here.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.160
No lights at night.

04:07.160 --> 04:09.960
There are, of course, lights all over the freeway.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.480
Maybe he means the protesters should have lights, but this is me guessing because all

04:13.480 --> 04:16.360
he ever says is, no lights.

04:16.360 --> 04:20.160
Regardless though, there's clearly enough lights to see the protesters from a distance,

04:20.160 --> 04:24.720
as evidenced by this camera showing us the protesters from a distance.

04:24.720 --> 04:25.720
Think about this.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.160
You're on a highway.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.760
You're coming around a curve.

04:28.760 --> 04:32.520
All of a sudden, before you realize it because it's at night and there's no lights, there's

04:32.520 --> 04:33.960
two vehicles in the middle of the road.

04:33.960 --> 04:34.960
What do you do?

04:34.960 --> 04:37.240
This guy swerved out of the way.

04:37.240 --> 04:40.680
When he swerved onto the shoulder, a ton of people were standing there.

04:40.680 --> 04:41.680
So what did he do?

04:41.680 --> 04:42.680
He swerved to the left.

04:42.680 --> 04:43.680
Pop, pop.

04:43.680 --> 04:48.360
And he hit two people, sending them flying, one of which is now dead.

04:48.360 --> 04:51.120
I can't believe they're charging this guy for this.

04:51.120 --> 04:55.200
The very idea that 30 people were hidden behind two vehicles and that the driver couldn't

04:55.200 --> 05:00.200
have possibly seen these two vehicles blocking off the road until the last second is absurd.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.980
The band Tim goes on about was roughly 600 feet away.

05:03.980 --> 05:08.240
That the highway had been empty for a quarter of a mile should have perhaps tipped him off.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.640
That something was up.

05:09.640 --> 05:14.480
Tim's standard incompetence aside, we get to the real heart of this video later on.

05:14.480 --> 05:18.600
Am I going to blame this guy because he was driving his car on the highway?

05:18.600 --> 05:19.600
That's ridiculous.

05:19.600 --> 05:24.440
If anything, the protesters should be held to some degree criminally, criminally liable

05:24.440 --> 05:26.140
for blocking a highway.

05:26.140 --> 05:27.640
It's a crime.

05:27.640 --> 05:29.120
Why aren't they getting in trouble?

05:29.120 --> 05:33.280
This is, of course, not the first time Tim has lied about footage.

05:33.280 --> 05:39.480
They're yelling, pop his effing tires and you hear them deflating his tires and then

05:39.480 --> 05:43.600
he slowly speeds up and they all start screaming and banging on his, actually, I'm sorry,

05:43.600 --> 05:45.360
they start banging on his vehicle first.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.960
Then he slowly speeds up.

05:46.960 --> 05:51.200
I don't want to say speeding, like he's inching forward and then people start going

05:51.200 --> 05:52.720
yelling.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.600
And then once he's clear of protesters, he just goes and takes off.

05:55.600 --> 05:56.600
That's it.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.720
Tim went on to play the shakiest, least helpful footage he could find, but if you actually

06:00.720 --> 06:05.520
look up the video he cites, you'll see that this part in particular didn't make it into

06:05.520 --> 06:06.520
Tim's video.

06:06.520 --> 06:14.360
That looks a little dangerous to me.

06:14.360 --> 06:18.100
There's also no footage of what happened before the vehicle was stopped by protesters.

06:18.100 --> 06:23.400
So the story, in Tim's mind, only starts when we see the vehicle surrounded by protesters.

06:23.400 --> 06:29.800
How it got there and in what way cannot possibly be inferred because all protesters are liars.

06:29.800 --> 06:31.200
And evil.

06:31.200 --> 06:39.680
Welcome to the modern era, where the activists will obviously lie about everything.

06:39.680 --> 06:41.480
Man evil people, I tell you what.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.880
I should offer a brief correction here.

06:42.880 --> 06:48.440
I used to think Tim was just a fool who had no idea what he was talking about.

06:48.440 --> 06:51.920
My position has evolved and I'll issue a correction right here.

06:51.920 --> 06:55.480
I think he's deliberately misrepresenting the facts here.

06:55.480 --> 07:00.560
He's just not particularly bright in how he goes about it, or at least he has a very serious

07:00.560 --> 07:04.880
contempt for his audience and doesn't think they'll care that he's so transparently

07:04.880 --> 07:06.400
lying to them.

07:06.400 --> 07:10.800
But social media provocateurs are not the only people downplaying vehicular assault.

07:10.800 --> 07:15.120
Tucker Carlson's Daily Wire has previously released a compilation of protesters being

07:15.120 --> 07:27.920
accosted by vehicles, played to the tune of Ludacris's Move, Bitch.

07:27.920 --> 07:34.080
Daily caller writer Blake Neff also published article with his headline and subheader.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.520
Anti-Columbus Day protesters threatened to assault driver get run over.

07:38.520 --> 07:43.480
White man overruns indigenous peoples with superior technology.

07:43.480 --> 07:48.120
Blake Neff, for the curious, was formerly the head writer for Tucker Carlson's Fox

07:48.120 --> 07:52.480
News show, but recently resigned after he was discovered to have participated in an

07:52.480 --> 07:57.080
explicitly racist message board for the last 10 years, often inserting the racist messaging

07:57.080 --> 08:00.140
from that board into scripts for Tucker Carlson.

08:00.140 --> 08:04.000
And of course, I would be remiss not to mention the death of Heather Heyer, who was murdered

08:04.000 --> 08:08.480
at the Charlottesville rally when a car ran into a group of counter-protesters.

08:08.480 --> 08:13.120
This incident was similarly spun by media figures and other assorted internet buffoons.

08:13.120 --> 08:18.760
Here's a brief example of YouTuber Carl Benjamin showing us his intellectual metal.

08:18.760 --> 08:26.640
It looks like what happened is that he was shocked by seeing the car crash happening

08:26.640 --> 08:31.440
and had a heart attack.

08:31.440 --> 08:38.440
I know, I know, it's horrible, but it does seem a very dramatic reaction to a car crash.

08:38.440 --> 08:42.080
It's more than the alt-right being blamed for someone having a heart attack.

08:42.080 --> 08:45.560
Someone in tremendously bad physical condition has heart attack and suddenly the alt-right

08:45.560 --> 08:47.000
has murdered someone.

08:47.000 --> 08:52.320
Mike Brown, a police detective for King County, which Seattle is a part of, posted a meme

08:52.320 --> 08:57.120
to his Facebook after Summer Taylor and Diaz Love were struck by a car.

08:57.120 --> 09:00.880
All lives splatter, keep your ass off the road.

09:00.880 --> 09:05.920
Brown is currently on leave and the family of Summer Taylor has called for his firing.

09:05.920 --> 09:11.440
All this spin, all these distortions are done with the express purpose of changing the narrative.

09:11.440 --> 09:15.680
It wants people to believe that the protesters who are hit by cars are not victims.

09:15.680 --> 09:20.760
That they are either liars and frauds or somehow deserving of any injury or death that

09:20.760 --> 09:23.960
meets them while they are trying to exercise their right to protest.

09:23.960 --> 09:28.840
The reactions commentators like this generate on social media are particularly ghoulish.

09:28.840 --> 09:32.680
Who else here feels sorry for the driver and any damages to their car?

09:32.680 --> 09:35.920
And I honestly don't care if those idiots were removed from the gene pool.

09:35.920 --> 09:39.800
They were in the middle of I-5 at night, the height of stupid.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.520
I call this self-defense.

09:41.520 --> 09:43.040
Why are they blocking the road?

09:43.040 --> 09:45.560
What are they going to do to you if you stop?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.540
This guy didn't want to find out.

09:47.540 --> 09:51.120
No one wants to get ripped from their cars from the mob anymore.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.080
We've had enough.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.080
The effect on the audience, I think, is clear.

09:56.080 --> 10:01.320
Working in tandem with messages describing protesters as violent rioters, particularly

10:01.320 --> 10:05.800
in the context of this story when the only violence expressed towards the driver came

10:05.800 --> 10:11.440
after he had just run over two people, is part of the goals of these anti-protest commentaries.

10:11.440 --> 10:15.880
The idea is to vilify the protesters and their message, and they'll ignore, distort,

10:15.880 --> 10:19.120
and lie about whatever facts they need to do that.

10:19.120 --> 10:23.840
Speaking to the New York Times, Ari E. Weil, the deputy research director at the Chicago

10:23.840 --> 10:28.280
Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago, described this growing culture

10:28.280 --> 10:31.280
of sharing memes about protesters being run over.

10:31.280 --> 10:33.400
It's not just an extremist thing here.

10:33.400 --> 10:37.420
There are social media circles online where people are sharing these and joking about

10:37.420 --> 10:40.740
them because they disagree with the protests and their methods.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.120
Sharing memes and joking about running over people can lead to real danger.

10:44.120 --> 10:49.260
This was echoed by Josh Lepowski, a senior researcher at the Counter Extremism Project.

10:49.260 --> 10:54.180
There has been an increasing amount of propaganda online calling for vehicular attacks on protesters,

10:54.180 --> 10:56.300
targeting the Black Lives Matter movement in particular.

10:56.300 --> 11:01.940
It is being used as a form of intimidation against them to get them to halt their protests.

11:01.940 --> 11:06.580
According to research done by Weil, there have been at least 66 car attacks across the

11:06.580 --> 11:12.580
United States since George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police on May 25th, 2020.

11:12.580 --> 11:17.860
Of those 66, 24 have led to charges being filed, while 4 have been ruled accidents.

11:17.860 --> 11:22.580
Perhaps most disturbingly, 7 of these incidents involved police officers.

11:22.580 --> 11:26.500
Car attacks have become an increasingly common topic in recent years, and in response, some

11:26.500 --> 11:30.620
state legislatures have proposed bills that would protect drivers who unintentionally

11:30.620 --> 11:32.540
harm or kill protesters.

11:32.540 --> 11:36.560
Although there are some Facebook memes to the contrary, so far none of these bills have

11:36.560 --> 11:38.280
actually been passed.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.000
There is an awkward conversation to be had regarding the safety of protesters, whether

11:42.000 --> 11:46.720
it be staying as visible as possible at night or effectively communicating threats to others.

11:46.720 --> 11:50.940
Many protests do have earnest discussions and big precautions to keep people safe, and

11:50.940 --> 11:55.040
I think good natured criticism on how that can be improved should be welcomed.

11:55.040 --> 11:59.340
But a sharp line needs to be drawn between constructive criticism to improve protests

11:59.340 --> 12:04.060
and criticism that's designed to undermine and discredit entire movements.

12:04.060 --> 12:09.560
When people such as Tim Poole or Mike Brown tell people to get off the streets, it isn't

12:09.560 --> 12:13.220
out of concern for the safety of protesters, it's because they want to discredit the

12:13.220 --> 12:14.920
very message behind the movement.

12:14.920 --> 12:19.240
When it comes to the individuals driving cars who crash through these protests, they're

12:19.240 --> 12:23.540
presented as victims of circumstance and not held to nearly the same level of responsibility

12:23.540 --> 12:25.180
of the protesters.

12:25.180 --> 12:29.140
Another thing lost in this discussion is that the safety of the protesters is not the only

12:29.140 --> 12:30.200
issue at play here.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.620
This is also about free expression.

12:31.620 --> 12:35.800
In the week leading up to me writing this script, free expression and cancel culture

12:35.800 --> 12:40.340
came up in the context of people being booted off very large platforms, such as the recent

12:40.340 --> 12:43.720
removal of Stefan Molyneux and Richard Spencer from YouTube.

12:43.720 --> 12:47.900
Every time this happens to a conservative, or in this case, white nationalist, there's

12:47.900 --> 12:52.040
an outcry from the right about how cancel culture is out of control and the left is

12:52.040 --> 12:56.260
constantly attacking the free marketplace of ideas.

12:56.260 --> 13:00.340
The free marketplace of ideas is an incredibly apt name, in that it functions the same way

13:00.340 --> 13:03.140
a free economic market works in society today.

13:03.140 --> 13:07.900
The lack of regulation creates the guise of a lack of bias, ignoring how some people have

13:07.900 --> 13:12.700
been left out of the conversation, and that the playing field is most certainly not even.

13:12.700 --> 13:17.940
Taylor and Love, much like other protesters, were exercising the right of free expression,

13:17.940 --> 13:21.740
but instead of racing to their defense, people who supposedly care about free expression

13:21.740 --> 13:25.980
are bending over backwards to blame them for being hit by a car.

13:25.980 --> 13:30.200
You probably wouldn't even know the names of these two people had one of them not died

13:30.200 --> 13:32.180
and the other been seriously injured.

13:32.180 --> 13:36.380
In much the same way Black Lives Matter only gained traction when thousands of people took

13:36.380 --> 13:39.880
to the streets, demanding the attention of the mainstream media.

13:39.880 --> 13:43.700
The opposition to Black Lives Matter only needs to call up the New York Times to get

13:43.700 --> 13:48.040
some free space in the op-ed section of one of the most prominent outlets in the world

13:48.040 --> 13:52.780
to say it's time to call them the military to bust the heads of these protesters.

13:52.780 --> 13:57.020
That is the disparity between people who have power in the marketplace of ideas and

13:57.020 --> 13:58.260
those who don't.

13:58.260 --> 14:01.620
One side of the argument needs hundreds of thousands of people in the streets, the other

14:01.620 --> 14:06.260
side needs a phone call, and suddenly their message is in front of millions.

14:06.260 --> 14:09.220
Someone who truly cares about free expression should be most concerned about protecting

14:09.220 --> 14:13.540
the expression and sometimes even holding up the expression of those with the least

14:13.540 --> 14:16.700
amount of access to that free marketplace of ideas.

14:16.700 --> 14:20.820
And this access cannot be entangled from the history of oppression that has denied people

14:20.820 --> 14:22.620
access to these spaces.

14:22.620 --> 14:27.140
Today we probably have more female commentators now than any other point in recent history

14:27.140 --> 14:28.740
in the English-speaking world.

14:28.740 --> 14:32.540
In the past, women commenting on important issues would have to write under a man's

14:32.540 --> 14:35.580
name, like George Eliot had to do in the 19th century.

14:35.580 --> 14:40.980
Or if they did openly brush up against serious subjects, they would have to issue weird prefaces

14:40.980 --> 14:45.900
apologizing for daring to talk about workers' rights, which Elizabeth Gaskell had to do

14:45.900 --> 14:48.140
in her novel, Mary Barton.

14:48.140 --> 14:51.860
I know nothing of political economy or the theories of trade.

14:51.860 --> 14:56.740
I have tried to write truthfully, and if my accounts agree or clash with any system,

14:56.740 --> 15:00.100
the agreement or disagreement is unintentional.

15:00.100 --> 15:04.220
Although it should be said that things have improved since the 19th century, things have

15:04.220 --> 15:09.260
not quite reached parity, as seen by any woman who has recently tried to speak out about

15:09.260 --> 15:13.500
video games or some other important issues insecure men have a vested interest in, and

15:13.500 --> 15:17.860
things get dramatically worse for people who are even further marginalized, such as a trans

15:17.860 --> 15:22.540
woman being harassed for daring to appear on the cover of Sports Illustrated.

15:22.540 --> 15:26.140
While cancel culture is an interesting debate, it's not a debate that's happening on

15:26.140 --> 15:27.700
even terms.

15:27.700 --> 15:31.340
Conservatives seem chiefly concerned with protecting their own rather than broadening

15:31.340 --> 15:35.940
the free marketplace of ideas to include people who have been historically denied access.

15:35.940 --> 15:39.780
If you don't want to protect protesters from being run over by cars, you don't care

15:39.780 --> 15:42.860
about protecting someone's free expression at all.

15:42.860 --> 15:47.300
Over the past scene of Summer Taylor, their family held a brief press conference.

15:47.300 --> 15:53.180
No matter how much I might want to ask them to stay safe during protests, they would just

15:53.180 --> 16:02.380
say, Mom, if you are black in this country, it isn't even safe to be alive.

16:02.380 --> 16:05.900
And they were right.

16:05.900 --> 16:12.900
So even in death, we want Summer's passion as an ally to continue lifting up black lives

16:12.900 --> 16:17.140
in Seattle and all over our country.

16:17.140 --> 16:20.500
There is a lot left to do.

16:20.500 --> 16:21.500
Thank you.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.140
Diaz Love is currently recovering from their injuries.

16:24.140 --> 16:29.340
They released a statement on Facebook reading, I'm alive and stable in a lot of pain.

16:29.340 --> 16:31.300
I cannot believe Summer was murdered.

16:31.300 --> 16:35.740
If they thought this murder would make us back down, they are very wrong.

16:36.740 --> 16:39.540
My FB is filled with death threats.

16:39.540 --> 16:43.020
That and only being able to use one hand has me going slow.

16:43.020 --> 16:46.740
I deeply appreciate and feel all the love y'all are sending me.

16:46.740 --> 16:52.520
I've included links to the GoFundMe pages for Summer's family and Diaz Love below.

16:52.520 --> 16:57.580
This was a tough video to do, especially since many of the details are not yet available.

16:57.580 --> 17:02.940
This case has not gone to trial, and the driver accused of the crime has not even been arraigned,

17:02.940 --> 17:07.140
so details are a bit sparse, but I wanted to focus on how someone's death and injury

17:07.140 --> 17:12.140
and how these car attacks in general are being spun to discredit very legitimate and valid

17:12.140 --> 17:13.880
protest movements.

17:13.880 --> 17:18.700
If you enjoyed this video, I would once again remind you that there are two GoFundMe pages

17:18.700 --> 17:20.740
for the victims linked below.

17:20.740 --> 17:25.180
If you would like to support my work, as many of the people going up the screen have, you

17:25.180 --> 17:26.900
can join my Patreon.

17:26.900 --> 17:31.940
And if you signed up for the $5 a month tier, you will get your name in the credits, like

17:31.940 --> 17:37.220
these lovely people here, a download to my theme song, written and performed by my lovely

17:37.220 --> 17:40.220
friend Dana, and early access to my videos.

17:40.220 --> 17:44.940
There actually is a video currently waiting to be uploaded to this channel that is available

17:44.940 --> 17:47.940
for my Patrons, that's there if you're interested as well.

17:47.940 --> 17:51.420
Thank you everyone very much for watching this video.

17:51.420 --> 17:55.140
Please remember to like, comment, subscribe, and ring the bell.

17:55.140 --> 17:56.460
I'll see you next time.
