0	5440	Let me first get something out of the way. This video is not going to be a takedown or
5440	11120	demolition of Dave Rubin. Ideally, Dave Rubin could watch this video himself and understand
11120	15520	a carefully constructed critique when he sees it. But in the land of the internet,
15520	18080	that might be asking for far too much.
23360	28240	Dave Rubin began his career as a bushy-tailed comedian performing in New York City. His early
28240	32320	career had him immediately touching on the world of political comedy when he interned
32320	38320	at The Daily Show. Rubin displayed some affinity towards creating his own platforms by starting
38320	44640	The Anti-Show, a short-lived comedy program filmed at NBC Studios that aired on Manhattan
44640	50640	Neighborhood Network in the fall of 2001. It was basically a daily show rip-off that
50640	55840	never really got off the ground. Speaking of not getting off the ground, Rubin also started two
55840	62000	different comedy clubs in New York City in the mid-2000s. The first, Joe Franklin's Comedy Club,
62000	68080	closed some time after 2009. I couldn't quite find the exact date on that one. And the second
68080	73680	club, I couldn't really find any information at all. The comedy company closed down, but its
73680	80000	former address is now occupied by a TGI Friday's, so at least it went out with a laugh. Rubin went
80000	84960	on to start several podcasts including Hot Gay Comics and The Ben and Dave Show, both of which
84960	91200	ended up being TV shows on the Here Network. But it was Rubin's The Six Pack, which was eventually
91200	96320	picked up by Sirius, that became a big hit. Rubin gave up the podcasting world and eventually moved
96320	101200	to Los Angeles where he began working at the progressive YouTube channel The Young Turks,
101200	106960	and so the Rubin Report was born. However, this was a far cry from the show we know of today.
106960	113280	It consisted of short clips touching on news stories of the day with Rubin's brand of humor thrown in.
113280	117920	Rubin also made the occasional appearance on cable news programs such as The O'Reilly Factor.
117920	122960	Here he is briefly commenting on what would later be a major cause for him. On the base of this,
122960	128240	I believe in free speech and I believe that Dan Cathy is welcome to say what he wants. And I
128240	133280	believe that the gay community at the same point is welcome to say what they want. Rubin eventually
133280	139200	broke with The Young Turks during what he would later refer to as his awakening. It began in
139280	145760	October of 2014 when Rubin saw the infamous confrontation between Sam Harris and Batman
145760	150000	on Real Time with Bill Maher, where some noise was made after Sam Harris called Islam,
153520	159680	some heated words were exchanged, and a wide-eyed Dave Rubin was sent on a voyage of self-discovery.
159680	163360	It was a voyage that he was on with a lot of other people who were regular viewers of
163360	168960	Rubin's current employer, The Young Turks. Shortly after the real-time confrontation,
168960	173600	Sam Harris sat down with Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks for a three-hour discussion. Although the
173600	179200	discussion was less a debate and more an exercise in masochism, Rubin, and many of the viewers,
179200	184560	felt some affinity with Harris's exasperation with the left. Rubin felt that exasperation so
184560	189200	strongly that he decided to break from The Young Turks and immediately take the Rubin report into
189200	195680	his own hands. And by immediately into his own hands, I mean taking a job with Riot five months
195680	216400	later. Although recently, most of TYT's audience tends to generally enjoy the content they put out,
216400	223280	there was a period around 2014 and 2015 where whenever there was any mention of Islam or a few
223280	227520	other hot-button topics in one of their videos, there would be an intense negative reaction.
228080	233360	Here's an illustrative comment. A significant segment of TYT's audience had strongly held
233360	239360	beliefs about Islam, feminism, and race, and they strongly disagreed with TYT's coverage of those
239360	244400	issues. This resentment towards discussion centered on identity politics was creating
244400	249520	a growing sense of outrage from those who thought the accusations of racism and sexism were getting
249520	255200	out of hand. This anger was coalescing into a general anti-left sentiment and can be seen in
255200	260480	comments like the ones on screen. The mere mention of terms like racism and sexism were enough to
260480	265680	trigger an outrage. While I don't speak to the personal motivations of those who share this anger,
265680	270880	it is one that can be found quite easily throughout YouTube, particularly in circles that disseminate
270880	275360	videos in which there is much gnashing of teeth about the SJW menace.
276240	281840	Ruben's YouTube career up to this point had mostly been mixed. His videos while working
281840	288320	under the Young Turks varied widely in their results. Some struggled to crack 10,000 viewers
288320	294480	while others reached millions. His time at Riot gave him some consistency but in the wrong
294480	300160	direction, with most videos struggling to break that 10,000 view barrier. Much of the content of
300160	305920	this time followed Ruben's earlier formula of commenting on News of the Day. Yes robots are
305920	310240	coming to destroy this and that's why I do it so that years from now on a cracked tv screen in a
310240	316480	room after the robotic overtake you'll see this and people go oh he knew what he was saying. But
316480	322240	being his own version of what a channel like TOIT was already doing wasn't cutting it so Ruben made
322240	327920	another change. Ruben's time with Riot came to an end when Ruben made the move to Larry King's Aura
327920	333920	TV in September of 2015. With this came a format change from brief commentary clips to long
333920	338960	one-on-one interviews. Ruben's first major interview just happened to be with the man who
338960	345040	inspired his awakening Sam Harris. The Ruben report we know of today was born during that
345040	350560	interview with Harris as Ruben not only found a format he enjoyed but he also found a particular
350560	359360	audience. One that would shape his show in the years to come. Ruben began his new format by
359360	364240	immediately addressing his audience with a series of rules. You can see them on screen and by and
364240	368960	large they're pretty straightforward for a left-leaning YouTube personality. I say left-leaning
368960	374560	because that's how Ruben describes himself at this point. Is seeing my side the people on the left
374560	379280	cherry picking facts stifling debate and labeling everyone they disagree with a racist, a bigot,
379280	384880	a homophobe or worse. From here we can see Ruben had some ideas of how his show was going to go
384880	389280	down. He was presenting himself not just as a person on the left though but rather someone
389280	395120	disaffected with the left. By choosing Sam Harris as his first interview subject he was courting the
395120	399680	same faction on the left that's dissatisfied with the content on channels like the Young Turks
399680	405280	particularly its commentary on social issues. One of the big promises early on in the Ruben report
405280	410000	was to speak with people from across the political spectrum. Ruben wanted to prove his
410000	415360	earnestness in exploring ideas by inviting a wide range of opinions and this is evidenced by many
415360	421040	of his earliest guests including the likes of Don Lemon, Larry Elder, Jimmy Dore and Douglas Murray.
421040	426080	But it was one guest in particular that really resonated with Ruben's new audience and that was
426080	431360	Milo Yiannopoulos. For those who may not remember Milo Yiannopoulos was a writer for the right-wing
431360	436960	media outlet Breitbart and he shot to fame championing the Gamergate controversy. After
436960	442560	outraging activists on the left for a few years he fell from grace after some old comments of him
442560	448800	came out that sound an awful lot like him defending pedophilia. Now he sells dick pills on crackpot
448800	454800	outlet InfoWars. While the Harris interview did well a few months earlier ratcheting up nearly
454800	458480	one million views at the time of writing this it was several small clips with the
458480	463280	Yiannopoulos that really excited the viewership of Ruben's channel. All three of these videos did
463280	468000	extremely well with the combined total of nearly five million views and leading to a spike in
468000	474000	subscriptions and views for Ruben's channel in October of 2015. I need to talk about Dave Ruben's
474000	479280	interview style for a moment. Ruben describes his own style in one of his early videos. I talked to
479280	483680	Mike Huckabee's campaign manager about gay marriage and she basically just danced around it.
483680	488400	Had I pushed her to the breaking point I probably would have never gotten access to her again
488400	492480	and then word would have traveled fast that I'm someone that they shouldn't talk to. So with that
492480	496800	in mind I tried my best to navigate all the interviews with some basic questions and then
496800	501520	some deeper probing. And this will be a theme in many of his interviews in the future. His approach
501520	506640	is so gentle so concerned with offending his guest that he would sooner let his guests walk
506640	511600	all over him and use his show as a convenient platform rather than strongly counter their
511600	518560	arguments. And that's precisely what Milo Yiannopoulos did. In 2015, Yiannopoulos was a darling
518560	522960	of the alt-right and gamergate crowds and the gentle interview Ruben had with him pleased
522960	528960	Yiannopoulos's fans so much that many of them decided to stick around. While some might argue
528960	533520	the interview helped put Yiannopoulos on the map, I would sooner say that it helped put the new
533520	540560	Ruben report on the map with a particular audience. Ruben had the audience of disaffected leftists
540560	545680	but Yiannopoulos brought with him a bunch of people from the extreme right who came to see someone on
545680	551200	the left play second banana to their idol. It wouldn't be the last time Ruben found himself
551200	555760	in this position. It should also be noted that Yiannopoulos was a guest that was recommended to
555760	561920	Ruben by his audience beforehand and as already evidenced, the disaffected left that was Ruben's
561920	567840	new base enjoyed hearing the likes of Yiannopoulos complain about the SJWs. Ruben's initial audience
567920	572800	were curious about this anti-left rhetoric coming from the right and while they may have seen
572800	578080	themselves as either on the left or center, they were willing to put any disagreements on hold to
578080	583040	enjoy a good bashing of those on the left they disliked. And in time, the lines between these
583040	588560	audiences would only get blurrier. The booking of Yiannopoulos was a small step in what Ruben was
588560	593040	trying to do with his show. He was hoping to engineer an audience that was not only enjoying
593040	598480	his content but also engaged online. There are numerous examples of Ruben encouraging his viewers
598480	603200	to become more engaged on Twitter and to call out misdeeds wherever they saw them, essentially
603200	607440	turning his audience into a group of online activists that the discussions we're having here
607440	612080	on the show as well as the ones that you guys are having on Twitter and YouTube are actually making
612080	617120	a difference. That's the beauty of the internet. You can get issues to actually bubble up until
617120	621840	mainstream takes notice. There's evidence of the awakening that I've been talking about all over
621920	626080	the place right now. The point of all this is that every week, actually every day that I've been
626080	630480	doing this show, I see this movement getting stronger. You guys are not only connecting with
630480	635040	me but with each other. And now when I see the usual regressives spout off their nonsense,
635040	641120	there's an army of people calling them out on it. That is literally as important as anything that I do.
641120	645680	In return, Ruben took booking suggestions and reading advice from his audience.
645680	649040	He wasn't so much the leader of a movement as he was a part of it.
649680	654960	The next indicator of the state of the Ruben Report audience was its reaction to his interview
654960	661600	with civil rights attorney Areva Martin in January of 2016. To date, it is by far his
661600	666960	least popular interview with the full interview in clipped sections, not getting close to 100,000
666960	672400	views. As an unambiguous voice from the left, the Ruben Report's audience decided Martin's
672400	678080	perspective wasn't a part of the battle of ideas that interested them. Of the few that watched the
678080	685120	Martin interview, the reaction was fierce. A large number of dislikes and comments like this one.
685120	690720	In fact, of all of Ruben's full-length feature interviews, this is the only one where the dislikes
690720	695120	don't number the likes. I don't suspect this is because of Ruben's performance.
695920	700400	Although Ruben trumpeted his platform as a place for voices from across the political spectrum,
700400	705120	it appeared as though the Ruben Report's audience was less interested in voices like Martin and more
705120	710080	interested in voices from the right, like Yiannopoulos. The next few months brought with
710080	715920	it feature interviews with Tommy Robinson, Mike Cernovich, Milo Yiannopoulos, again, and perhaps
715920	721680	most notably, Ben Shapiro. Shapiro, editor for the conservative outlet The Daily Wire,
721680	726480	is a fairly prominent conservative voice who is best known for challenging teenagers on Twitter
726480	731520	and breaking them on the wheel of logic. A little under a year after having him on his show,
731520	736880	Dave Ruben would cite Ben Shapiro, along with earlier guests Sam Harris and Larry Elder,
736880	741680	along with future guest Eric Weinstein, as trusted guides to the world of politics.
742560	747840	Even more telling is that interviews with Harris, Elder, and Shapiro go on to be the most popular
747840	753600	on the channel. Ruben's tastes and his audiences were beginning to align. I want to look at this
753600	761040	comment under the first Shapiro interview from Alex Jones. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, well,
761040	767680	damn, maybe it is Alex Jones, shit. Ruben's style is lauded here as presenting ideas an audience
767680	772480	might not be comfortable with, along with some self-congratulations for being willing to listen
772480	776880	to them. This charity and open-mindedness is something that often accompanies many of the
776880	781600	interviews Ruben has with right-wing guests. The same level of charity never seems to meet the
781600	787280	left-wing guests. They're more likely to meet the fate of Areva Martin, either being ignored or
787280	792000	fiercely disagreed with. The Ruben Report is becoming a place welcoming to voices from the
792000	797600	right while shunning voices from the left. But before leaving season one entirely, there are
797600	803200	two curious direct messages I want to point out first. The real threat of a Donald Trump presidency
803200	808960	and how to stop Trump. Of all of Dave Ruben's direct messages, these two have the worst like
808960	815440	to dislike ratio. Aside from Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee from later in
815440	822480	the year. Gee, I wonder why that one got so much hate. The Trump videos feature Dave opining the
822480	827360	divisiveness in politics, and he takes the time to criticize the left for the rise of Trump.
828160	834480	Why he doesn't blame the right for the rise of the progressives is a mystery. In spite of the
834480	839440	name of the video, Ruben only offers a mild criticism of Trump instead falling back on a
839440	845680	common talking point of the time of Trump being some kind of unknowable wildcard. Ruben's advice
845680	851200	to stop Trump is less about what to do to stop him and more about what not to do if you want to
851200	857760	stop him. In other words, his advice for stopping Trump is to admonish the left for behaving badly.
858800	864560	This encapsulates what his channel is often about and what binds the Ruben Report's audience
864560	871120	together. Anger towards the left. Ruben in these videos has demonstrated either consciously or
871120	876640	unconsciously that he knows how to tap into that audience, and that makes all commentary either
876640	883680	explicitly or partially anti-left. Or at this point in the Ruben Report, it would still be considered
883680	890160	anti-regressive. The distinction between regressive and left wouldn't fade until sometime later.
890960	896160	To complete his critical look at Trump, Ruben's guest following these two direct messages were
896160	902400	Mike Cernovich, a Trump operative, and Milo Yiannopoulos. He had famously called Trump his
902400	909040	daddy. This comment from a Dale Gribble alias under how to stop Trump sums up a significant
909040	914880	portion of the Ruben Report's audience. Trump is the anti-left candidate they've all been waiting
914880	920080	for. This was the state of affairs of the Ruben Report heading into the relaunch of the show in
920080	927680	June of 2016. The project had rare fruit for Ruben, and he was getting ready to take it to the next level.
933200	937680	At what can be thought of as season two of the Ruben Report, some major changes happened behind
937680	942960	the scenes. Ruben left Aura TV when they decided to move away from YouTube as a platform for its
942960	947680	videos, and Ruben felt like he needed to be loyal to the audience on YouTube he had helped build.
948240	953200	Ruben moved the show from the Aura Studios to his own home. Now Ruben was faced with the new
953200	959760	challenge. He had to finance the whole thing. Enter every YouTuber's favorite crowdfunding platform,
959760	966560	Patreon. As a side note, the Ruben Report's Patreon was actually started in November of 2015,
966560	972320	over half a year earlier. It only had about a few dozen supporters back then though. It didn't
972320	977760	really pick up any momentum until this season two push in July of 2016 where Ruben asked the
977760	983840	Ruben Report audience to dig deep. And dig deep they did with the number of backers jumping up to
983840	994400	$2,354 and Ruben earning $21,402 a month. The audience who had shaped the Ruben Report had
994400	999600	bought in. Dave Ruben had often equated what he did on the show as being just as important as the
999600	1004640	activism of the audience. He lavished them with praise for their activity on social media and
1004640	1010240	sometimes jumped into the middle of Twitter fights himself. Assuming you haven't had an intense
1010240	1014400	hypnotherapy session to block this out of your memory, you probably remember there was an election
1014400	1019760	in the fall of 2016. Shortly after Ruben returned from his break, Hillary Clinton was declared the
1019760	1025520	nominee for the Democratic Party and this direct message is easily his least popular. It can't
1025520	1030240	really be compared to any direct message he put together for Trump's nomination though as he
1030240	1034320	never made one of those. But the comments from the Ruben Report's audience make it quite clear who
1034320	1039920	they prefer in this upcoming race. To cap it off, Ruben's guest following this direct message was
1039920	1046160	none other than Clinton critic and felon Dinesh D'Souza. The second DM I want to talk about is
1046160	1050720	Ruben's discussion of the alt-right. Although he doesn't identify with the group himself,
1051280	1057760	he largely excuses their actions as antics by ironic Nazis. Ruben is very gentle with his
1057760	1062960	criticism of the alt-right, noting that while real racist and Nazis exist in their ranks,
1062960	1069920	what the alt-right really is though is a band of meme posters, anime avatars, and Twitter eggs
1069920	1076160	vying for attention from people in power. They post Nazi memes, racist pictures, and offensive
1076160	1082400	tweets with the express intent of getting powerful people to react, respond, and thus
1082400	1088320	amplify their message. They are keyboard warriors and professional trolls trying to get attention
1088320	1094720	from the sold out and corrupt media and political elite that we have. Some true racists mixed with
1094720	1100080	a bunch of people who just want to mess with those in power. How many of each of them are there? We
1100080	1107360	have no idea. What we do know though is that these people wield very little real world power.
1107360	1112400	He doesn't see the group as completely despicable, and for good measure he blames Hillary Clinton
1112400	1117280	for their rise. In this instance though, he doesn't try to take the middle route balancing
1117280	1122960	right and left. He explicitly says he believes the alt-right is better than the regressive left,
1122960	1128160	and he believes this to be true because of how he's been informed by the Ruben report audience.
1129120	1134880	Personally, I think that the regressive left is more of a threat to our democracy than the
1134880	1140880	alt-right. The regressive left with its tactics of stifling debate and silencing critics
1140880	1146720	has gained mainstream traction in our media and in our universities. These regressive,
1146720	1153440	not progressive ideas, have become all too common on the left and they've actually given birth
1153520	1158240	to the natural response, the alt-right. I know this firsthand not only from the emails that you
1158240	1163760	guys send me, but also from all the students at UCLA who came up to me after my event with Milo
1163760	1168720	Yiannopoulos a couple months ago to tell me that they're supporting Trump just because they can't
1168720	1175920	take the culture of fear around speech anymore. In the eye of this storm still exists some people
1175920	1181200	in the Ruben report audience who don't share these increasingly anti-left views and no trouble when
1181200	1186480	they see it. A few comments like these pop up on Ruben's videos expressing dismay and concern,
1186480	1192080	but they become less common as the months drag on. Ruben gives up on being completely independent
1192080	1197600	as he announces a partnership with Learn Liberty. Learn Liberty is a project by the Institute for
1197600	1202400	Humane Studies which is notably funded by billionaire Charles Koch, who is by far its
1202400	1216160	biggest contributor, having from 1999 to 2014 donated $14,963,318. IHS and by extension
1216160	1220080	Learn Liberty have been pushing forward a libertarian message across a number of projects
1220080	1224400	over the years, frequently from a right-wing perspective. Their partnership with the Ruben
1224400	1230560	report is doing much of the same. Although Dave Rubin, as far as I've been able to discover,
1230640	1235040	has never gone into the specifics of what his partnership with Learn Liberty entails,
1235040	1239600	we know at least one part of this deal includes having guests selected by Learn Liberty appear
1239600	1244640	on the Ruben report. This has, in effect, given Learn Liberty some editorial control over the show.
1245280	1249680	Much like ceding control to the audience, this is another example of Rubin bargaining away
1249680	1255840	control over the show that bears his name. Now I don't point this out as a direct criticism,
1255840	1260800	but would rather refer back to Rubin's stated goals in starting this show. He expressed a desire
1260800	1264960	to speak to people from across the political spectrum, and he's given significant control
1264960	1270000	over the booking of his show to his audience, which has a strong anti-left bias, and Learn Liberty,
1270000	1276720	whose libertarian perspective often put it at odds with the left. If Rubin wants balance on his show,
1276720	1282320	that is, exploring ideas from across the spectrum, it's at this point he should be wondering where
1282320	1287600	voices from the left will be coming from. And it's from here that the election kicks into high
1287600	1293600	gear, and we get a barrage of election-themed content. Rubin's commentary about the election,
1293600	1299440	as is usual for him, takes the center route, advocating for a nonspecific diversity of voices.
1300160	1307600	He interviews transhumanist candidate Zoltan Istvan. The audience is less interested in this interview,
1307600	1314640	or most of the alternative voices that don't support an anti-left stance. The Istvan interview
1314640	1320320	netted less than 100,000 views across all four clips, whereas, at roughly the same time,
1320320	1326160	the Rubin reportings lapped up an interview with filmmaker Cassie Jay about her sympathetic look
1326160	1332160	at men's rights activism. In the interest of presenting some concerns from the Rubin Report
1332160	1336400	channel, though, regarding its view count, I should point out to this comment where it's
1336960	1341520	suspected or hypothesized by the Rubin Report that view counts aren't being
1341520	1345680	accurately reported by YouTube, and people are being unsubscribed from the channel.
1346480	1350960	This is one of many claims that have come from Dave Rubin over the years about YouTube
1350960	1356080	interfering with his channel, often based on hearsay or random comments from his audience.
1357040	1362880	I would love to dive into this YouTube conspiracy, but that will have to be a topic for another day.
1363520	1368160	Rubin's audience continued to make its feelings clear as the 2016 election continued. In an
1368160	1374160	interview of October of 2016 with scientist and secular activist Lawrence Krauss, a slightly
1374160	1380000	unfavorably received section criticizing Trump includes this comment. It illustrates so very
1380000	1384240	clearly what matters more to the Rubin Report audience, whether Clinton or Trump will be more
1384320	1389680	sensitive to the concerns of, from their perspective, the SJW menace. That's why they
1389680	1394240	would sooner watch a video about a female filmmaker being red-pilled over a discussion
1394240	1398720	of alternative candidates, or even the alternative candidates themselves.
1399360	1404400	Rubin had on a pro-Clinton guest in Hilary Rosen, and the response from the audience was
1404400	1410400	predictable. A comment like this, while seeming to represent the thirst for diversity within the
1410400	1415120	Rubin Report audience, is betrayed by the complete disinterest of the majority of the
1415120	1419680	actual audience. Much like the voices in the audience asking for more left-leaning guests,
1420480	1426800	this one is a minority within an increasingly anti-left group. As a brief exception,
1427440	1432000	with some people on the left, such as David Sirota, the Rubin Report audience can be quite
1432000	1437520	kind if that person is on to criticize the left. So what matters most is not if the guests are
1437520	1443200	right or left-wing, but will at least pay lip service to anti-left rhetoric. This all
1443200	1448800	translates to an audience that was overwhelmingly pro-Trump, a candidate who unabashedly appealed
1448800	1453840	to the American right, and was seen as taking on those bastards on the left. Well, you know,
1453840	1457440	from his perspective. After the election of Donald Trump,
1457440	1462160	Dave Rubin was quick to issue a direct message titled, Don't Freak Out About Donald Trump.
1462880	1466000	This direct message includes Rubin calling Trump's election.
1466000	1470880	This was a win for us, right? Because if you think about it, the elite, the media, everybody,
1470880	1476240	the establishment all wanted one thing to happen. And what happened? The people actually use their
1476240	1481280	voting power to stop that very thing from happening. That's actually beautiful. I think
1481280	1485120	he's going to have to govern really from the center. And I think that will be really good
1485120	1489280	for classical liberals, basic liberal people. I think it'll be really good
1489280	1494000	for mainstream conservatives. And then maybe the people that are better on the fringes of
1494000	1499600	all of this thing will so slowly be silenced. That's my suspicion at the moment. And maybe
1499600	1503360	I have a slight sense of what I'm talking about because I kind of saw this whole thing unfolding
1503360	1509280	the way it did. Although the prediction has fallen on its face, the win comment in particular
1509280	1513440	is interesting as it perfectly describes what much of the Rubin report audience celebrates
1513440	1519760	in Trump. And that's a win against the SJW crowd, who at this point are being conflated with the left
1519760	1524960	in general. When Dave Rubin describes the Democratic Party as being the identity politics driven
1524960	1531120	Democratic Party. After nominating Hillary Clinton, a woman who has very little support
1531120	1536960	in more progressive circles, it shows how anti-regressive has really shifted to just being
1536960	1542240	anti-left. And it shows how Rubin's perspective has shifted quite a bit to the right.
1543200	1548000	With Rubin's perspective being informed by his audience, it's safe to assume that they're all
1548000	1553520	on the same page. This is also the direct message where Rubin infamously mentions holding Trump's
1553520	1564480	feet to the fire. Yeah, another one that didn't age too well. This direct message also preceded
1564480	1568800	what would become the Rubin report's highest rated full-length feature interview, Rubin's
1568880	1573840	discussion with Jordan Peterson. This interview I really only mentioned because it's one of our
1573840	1580560	earliest instances of Peterson crying over a children's cartoon. Most of your viewers will
1580560	1585760	have watched Pinocchio. Probably. There's a scene in Pinocchio where Geppetta wishes on a star,
1586800	1592400	right? And what it means is he lifts up his eyes beyond the horizon to something transcendent,
1592960	1597760	to something ultimate, because that's what a star is. It's part of the of the eternity of the night
1597760	1602720	sky. And so he lifts his eyes up above his daily concerns and he says, what I want,
1608880	1617760	what I want more than anything else is that my creation will become a genuine individual.
1618400	1622640	A phrase Rubin has been using a lot at this point, referring to people he speaks with is,
1622640	1627600	whether I agreed with them or not, it doesn't matter whether Rubin agrees with his guests
1627600	1633680	or not. Rubin's views have become far less important to this discussion and far less important
1633680	1639360	to this show. The Rubin report has always been a platform for Rubin's guests to deliver their
1639360	1644560	views without a serious challenge or debate. And when that platform is being heavily influenced
1644560	1650400	by an anti-left audience and libertarian advocacy group, it's going to privilege certain viewpoints
1650400	1656320	over others. Although Rubin frequently talks about a new center, and he's been doing this
1656640	1662480	as early as the end of 2015, having borrowed the phrase from a former guest, Ali Rizvi,
1662480	1667760	the term really comes into prominence here as he ties it to the Trump presidency and the guests on
1667760	1675920	his show. If his show is in essence the center, why is it skewing so heavily in favor to guests
1675920	1682000	from the right? In 2017, big things started happening with the Rubin report. An interview
1682000	1686720	with conservative commentator Dennis Prager in January did especially well, and it was followed
1686720	1691280	a few weeks later by Dave Rubin essentially announcing what many had already suspected,
1691280	1698960	that he was no longer a member of the left. His Why I Left the Left video for PragerU,
1698960	1703680	which I should mention is not a real university, was widely disseminated,
1703680	1709840	and as of this writing it's sitting slightly under 6.5 million views. To date, it's one of
1709840	1714240	the most popular on the PragerU channel, ranking right up there with videos such as
1714240	1719520	The War on Boys and Don't Follow Your Passion. Really inspiring stuff.
1720720	1725360	The momentum built through early 2017 with big subscriber and Patreon jumps in the first five
1725360	1730320	months of the year. The big draws and interviews were former Fox News personality Glenn Beck,
1730320	1735840	conservative commentator Clary Elder, and failed Canadian asylum seeker Lauren Southern. It was also
1735920	1741040	when the free speech wars broke out. A time of great suffering and hardship for all.
1741040	1745600	But perhaps most remembered for its great victories, immortalized by Dave Rubin and his
1745600	1752800	direct message, huge win in the battle of ideas. In March of 2017, video commentator Colin Moriarty,
1752800	1757520	who had recently appeared on the Rubin report as a guest, made a hackney joke on Twitter.
1757520	1762320	In Moriarty's estimation, he was then the victim of a concentrated attack from opportunists in
1762320	1767360	the gaming press. There's plenty of discussions on this on how accurate that assessment is on the
1767360	1772640	internet, but the controversy led to Moriarty starting a Patreon that netted him $40,000
1772640	1777360	a month when it opened, although it's dropped considerably since. Moriarty is only worth
1777360	1781120	mentioning because of how he relates to the Rubin report. Rubin brought him on for a live
1781120	1785280	discussion following the tweet, where they answered questions to the tune of Super Chats,
1785280	1790880	and the Moriarty story led to, according to Rubin himself, a jump of nearly $2,000 a month
1790880	1797360	in the Rubin report's Patreon support. The direct message declaring the huge win in the battle of
1797360	1802480	ideas encapsulates much of what makes the Rubin report's audience tick. It's a victory parade
1802480	1808000	of sorts, where victory is measured in Patreon dollars and Moriarty is championed as a martyr,
1808000	1811760	although instead of 40 virgins, he got 40 grand in Patreon dollars.
1812560	1816800	Support for Moriarty is best understood as him being a new hero for the audience.
1816800	1821600	Much like Rubin, he took a stand against the SJWs, the Left, the Regressives, or whatever
1821600	1827360	pejorative label that animates the Rubin report audience. And so long as Rubin and people like
1827360	1832880	Moriarty make similar sounds, the audience is ready to reward them. The next few months,
1832880	1837760	leading to the end of what Rubin colorfully referred to as Season 2 of the Rubin report,
1837760	1842720	reintroduced an ambivalence to current affairs outside of stories like the Moriarty one.
1842720	1846960	While the first half of 2017 wasn't devoid of news stories in the world, Rubin seemed
1846960	1851600	less curious in holding Trump's feet to the fire and more concerned with stories surrounding Ann
1851600	1857360	Coulter being deplatformed and Bill Maher using a racial slur. If the first year of the Rubin report
1857360	1862240	was about finding his audience, the second was about the audience finding its host, as the
1862240	1867520	anti-left sentiment cemented in Dave Rubin himself and the audience had the conservative-friendly
1867520	1872400	voice wrapped in a left-wing package they were looking for. In a discussion with Dennis Prager,
1872400	1874400	it was summed up quite nicely here.
1902400	1909280	The third season of the Rubin report started in September of 2017 with the fiddently titled
1909280	1914800	Season 3 of the Rubin report starts now. No mistakes on timing there. In the direct message,
1914800	1919840	we get more of the usual platitudes Rubin extends to the audience and another appeal to them for
1919840	1931840	booking suggestions for the new season of the show. The responses are telling.
1931840	1937760	They range from libertarian poster boy Ron Paul to diluted crackpot poster boy Mark Dice.
1938320	1943280	One of the few genuine voices from the left recommended is YouTuber and Dark Mother
1943280	1948320	Disciple ContraPoints, but the reaction by some of the Rubin report's audience demonstrates how
1948320	1953120	interested they are in voices from the left with a bit of transphobia thrown in for good measure.
1954240	1958160	But the Rubin report's audience isn't the only thing moving increasingly to the right.
1958720	1964240	In a direct message covering the NFL players taking a knee, which was a story about protesting
1964240	1969600	police violence against black men, there was much rage amidst conservatives and it led to Donald
1969600	1974800	Trump instructing owners to fire the players. Free speech defender Dave Rubin defended the
1974800	1980400	players' rights while simultaneously defending the owners' right to fire the players. For a man
1980400	1985680	who has spoken up so extensively about the chilling effect of being called a racist or sexist,
1985680	1990960	his defense of people literally losing their job while exercising their right to free speech
1990960	1996720	is a serious break from his usual fawning over the First Amendment. Looking at the comments,
1996720	2002000	though, it's not the least bit surprising that the Rubin report's audience shares this sentiment,
2002000	2006720	and it really demonstrates how paper thin their commitment to free speech actually is.
2006720	2011040	On the week of that taking the knee direct message, Rubin's guess was Candace Owens,
2011040	2016960	a commentator who operates under the label Red Pill Black. No extra points for guessing
2016960	2021520	where she came down on the issue of taking the knee, and naturally the Rubin report's audience
2021520	2026960	was thrilled to hear from her. The last direct message from 2017 I want to mention is from
2026960	2032800	October, and it discusses the Las Vegas shooting. In contrast to the previous direct message, where
2032800	2037840	Rubin very much toed the line with his audience, this one took a slightly different tactic. It's
2037840	2043520	also the fourth least popular direct message on the channel. This direct message includes Rubin
2043520	2048240	bucking the majority of his audience and advocating for gun control. Of course, in the message,
2048240	2054400	he equivocates this by speaking at length about mental health, but to discuss gun control at all
2054400	2060160	is a position the Rubin report audience have little interest in. The comments are universal
2060160	2064720	in their distaste for gun control, and Rubin's crowdsourcing through the Rubin report audience
2064720	2070240	for a guest to educate him on gun laws likely have the obvious effect of pushing Rubin further
2070240	2077440	to the right. This is a microcosm of how the Rubin report works. It starts with a flimsily held
2077440	2083600	centrist position. Rubin sources guests based on the recommendation from his anti-left crowd.
2083600	2089200	An inevitable conservative comes to educate Rubin and any outliers in the audience on how to think,
2089200	2092880	and everyone nodding along with the channel takes another step to the right.
2093600	2097360	And those right-wing voices make the show a beacon for more right-wing viewers too.
2098000	2103680	The next time Rubin introduces a topic and states his position, it'll be a little further to the
2103680	2109600	right. And the next time his audience suggests or reacts to a guest, there will be more voices
2109600	2115120	from the right-making comments. And the cycle continues, all while the channel keeps racking
2115120	2121520	up subs and Patreon keeps racking up dollars. In that theoretical model of how the Rubin report
2121520	2127600	functions, the political leanings of Dave Rubin is one of the least important variables. This is
2127600	2132880	one thing I think most criticisms of the Rubin report get wrong, or at least get far too hung
2132880	2138640	up on. Whatever Dave Rubin might call himself doesn't matter as much as the system he oversees.
2139280	2143600	He can be a classical liberal, a secret conservative, or a clueless progressive,
2143600	2148240	and it wouldn't matter. The positions of the Rubin report guests and its audience are what
2148240	2153680	animate this conveyor belt that moves viewers, and Rubin himself, from the left to the right.
2154400	2159120	It's possible something could disrupt this model, and perhaps an audience can only be pulled so far
2159120	2164560	to the right before they check out or demand more moderate voices, but I'm not sure the Rubin report
2164560	2170560	has hit that limit just yet. As I write this in early 2018, very little has changed in the land
2170560	2175680	of Rubin. Dave Rubin continues to make increasingly right-wing claims, going so far as to say he would
2175680	2180480	support Donald Trump over Bernie Sanders. If everything basically says like it is right now,
2180480	2186480	and my choice in 2020 is either Trump, or Bernie, or Elizabeth Warren, or Gavin Newsom, or one of
2186480	2191680	these crazy progressives, I'm voting Trump, and I won't have a problem doing it. And the audience
2191680	2197680	is still ravenous for conversations between the likes of Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson. And
2197680	2202800	with over 2 million views and 40 times the number of likes to dislikes, there's a clear sign here
2202800	2209520	that the Rubin report audience has an insatiable hunger for this type of content. Compare that to
2209520	2215680	the recent interview with David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, and certainly
2215680	2222160	nobody's progressive, and we see the views drop down to 60,000 for the main interview, and a huge
2222160	2227600	outpouring of dislikes. At this point, the Rubin report's audience is reliably on the right, if
2227600	2232720	not far right. Whatever labels they wish to champion, when they have warmer reactions for
2232720	2239040	the likes of Stefan Molyneux or Lauren Southern instead of David Frum, this is not traditional
2239040	2244960	conservative politics. While I don't have any real data to accurately measure the political alignment
2244960	2249840	of the Rubin report audience, here is some spontaneous polling of the audience at a Dave
2249840	2254720	Rubin comedy show to give us a worthless anecdote. How many of you would say that you're conservatives
2254720	2264400	by a round of applause? How many conservatives, how many of you, how many of you are libertarians,
2264400	2275680	libertarians? All right, we did conservatives, we did libertarians. How many of you, how many
2275680	2285760	progressives, how many progressives? So we got, not one, no one will say it, I mean we're not going
2285760	2290960	to take, shoot you. I mean, oh we have one, we have one, please take them outside.
2293360	2297360	So we did conservatives, we did libertarians, we did, how many classical liberals?
2297360	2308800	Some selection biases at play here, because anyone going to a Dave Rubin comedy show must
2308800	2311600	really love the guy, or pay themselves.
2316640	2321200	Ultimately, I think Dave Rubin isn't just a supporter of the free marketplace of ideas,
2321840	2326640	he's also a victim. By throwing the reins of his show to the audience and following the money,
2326640	2331920	whatever vision he had of a show that spanned the political spectrum was co-opted by anti-left and
2331920	2339040	conservative voices. The free market was never going to protect Rubin's ideal platform. How could it?
2339040	2343920	As much as we might like to think everyone has a spot in the marketplace, we're limited by the
2343920	2348880	people we can reach and the people who will listen to us. As much as we like to think a strong idea
2348880	2354320	can survive any onslaught, it can never be heard if it's never given a platform, and a platform
2354320	2358960	that refuses to engage with one side of the political spectrum, or at least grows increasingly
2358960	2364400	hostile towards it, will never be a place where ideas can be fairly compared. In an ideal world,
2364400	2368880	the free marketplace of ideas would truly let every idea have a shot at expressing itself,
2368880	2374080	and be presented to a diverse audience capable of making a reasonable consideration of the evidence.
2374080	2379280	But, in the world we've got, the ideas that get championed or platformed are often the ones coming
2379280	2384800	from people with resources to make that happen. A libertarian think tank funded by wealthy people
2384800	2390320	can spread its ideas of classical liberalism more easily than a trans activist with a blog.
2391200	2396080	If you claim to be a space where all ideas can be discussed and then deliberately host one side
2396080	2401600	far more than the other on just about every issue, you aren't the free market you pretend to be.
2401600	2404560	You're an opportunist platform fighting for the status quo.
2404560	2406720	I think you know what one of those places is called.
