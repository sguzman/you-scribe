00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940
Thanks to the very generous patrons over on my Patreon, I am now earning over $100 a month on this channel.

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:13,060
So that means they've unlocked an old video I made two years ago responding to a Sargon of Akkad video called

3
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:18,120
Social Justice is in Cool. Fair warning, the audio here is pretty rough.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:23,220
The mic I used was pretty terrible and originally I was just gonna release the audio

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,700
but I realized huge chunks of it don't make any sense without certain visuals, so I've kind of patched that in.

6
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:33,940
But this is very much a quick video that I hope people will enjoy while I've got something bigger in the works.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,440
It's honestly not my best work. There's a reason I didn't put it online.

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,580
I didn't think it was especially great, but I thought it would be a fun extra and maybe people can get something out of it.

9
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:51,120
Now that Carl Benjamin is currently running for office, this video seems like an artifact from before he was making a fool of himself

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,860
on an international stage. I think this video is a nice reminder that he was never that bright.

11
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,220
He was never that thoughtful. And the main reason I never uploaded it was because I realized I was essentially

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,060
responding to a completely vacuous statement about what is and is not cool. As one of his commenters put it,

13
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,580
he was basically operating at the level of an obnoxious high school kid.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,820
Which seems about right for his entire career to be honest. Enough of my rambling. Here's the actual video.

15
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,980
I hope you all like it and once again apologies for the audio.

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:26,020
I've noticed that over the last 10 years people have been posting nonsense on YouTube.

17
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,020
As a rational person, I've decided it's fallen upon me to point out how wrong they are. So here I go.

18
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:34,340
First guy I want to talk about is

19
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,600
Sargon of Akkad and his video, social justice is uncool.

20
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:46,220
One of the first examples he uses is Sarah's Scribbles, a webcomic by Sarah Anderson, which he classifies as

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
self-indulgent nonsense.

22
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:55,300
He mentioned something about the comics having the preachy quasi-religious rhetoric of social justice.

23
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:01,580
The problem is the webcomic he points out has nothing to do with social justice.

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:10,660
Unless time management is a social justice issue now. Next he points out how white nationalists are parodying this particular webcomic.

25
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,980
I guess white nationalists parodying something means it must have a social justice agenda.

26
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:22,380
But I don't really follow the train of thought here since I generally don't let white nationalists frame my criticisms.

27
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:30,140
And it sounds like Sargon is alluding to that Anderson is asking for it with her content.

28
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:38,460
That's pretty classy. Anyway, we're just warming up here. A bigger example Sargon wants to talk about is the comic book industry and its

29
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,900
stark decline.

30
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,700
Social justice apparently means including Hillary Clinton and Justin Trudeau in a comic book.

31
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:53,660
I'm not really sure why this is the case, but he'd be horrified to know that politicians have been in comics for many years.

32
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:01,260
From recent appearances like Obama and Spider-Man to older ones like JFK and Superman. It's something that's been going on for decades.

33
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:08,620
As for the Hillary story, it turns out it wasn't published in any sort of watchman titled by DC Comics.

34
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:16,060
It was actually created by two independent artists, Aaron Edwards and Arlen Schumer for their website The Outline.

35
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:21,340
They're reimagining the original watchman series as if it were taking place following Trump's election.

36
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,300
Kind of an interesting idea, although the reverence for Hillary is kind of

37
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,180
uh

38
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,180
odd, I guess.

39
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:38,620
But the important thing is that this is not a comic being published by DC Comics. It's just taken from some random website.

40
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:43,740
And God knows why DC is jumping on this bandwagon. Well,

41
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:50,300
they aren't. Now Thor, holy shit. Apparently this new Thor comic is

42
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:54,140
that this comic is an act of cultural conquest.

43
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,900
Who knew?

44
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:03,900
He takes issue with Absorbing Man's dialogue. Apparently it's standing in for old Thor readers, or at least those who have issues with an e-fennail Thor.

45
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,540
This is a really cynical reading.

46
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,260
Basically assumes that all the old Thor readers are reactionary manchildren who are upset that their favorite character lost his name.

47
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,860
The point here is that Absorbing Man is supposed to sound small and petty,

48
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,860
representing a fraction of the readership. A fact backed up by the sales numbers,

49
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:27,660
but we'll get to that shortly. If someone really misses Guy Thor, you can actually still read a button in the other Thor comic.

50
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,980
Some conquest.

51
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:31,980
Captain America is a Nazi.

52
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:35,340
Actually, he's a Niger, whose history is a bit more complicated than that.

53
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,860
Maybe instead of looking at an article about the story, we can actually look at its contents.

54
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:48,060
In this particular narrative, the Red Skull, Captain America's arch enemy and a actual Nazi,

55
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:54,700
rewrote history using the cosmic cube to change Captain America's past so that he's a member of Hydra.

56
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:01,740
Call me a cynical comic reader if you must, but I suspect this change may not be permanent.

57
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:04,780
That perhaps the villain might actually lose in the end.

58
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,820
Sort of like how Spider-Man did that a few years ago when Doctor Octopus took over his mind for a year,

59
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,940
or when Iron Man was made evil by a magic spell gone awry. In other words,

60
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:20,220
it's an unfinished comic book story that will end with Captain America going back to his old patriotic self.

61
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,980
That's right, it's not even finished yet, but hey, let's accuse it of all sorts of shit.

62
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,420
But as for that particular story's commentary on America,

63
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,140
it's actually not about Captain America fans being Nazis, believe it or not.

64
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,020
I mean, who would call the readership Nazis?

65
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,700
And it's pretty good from what I've read so far anyway, and I'm hoping to read the rest of it when it's finally finished.

66
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:50,540
Sargon hones in on comments from Marvel's VP of Sales, David Gabriel, who in a recent comment mentioned how sales have been dropping

67
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,460
due to the influx of new characters, including visible minorities and women in Marvel's recent titles.

68
00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:00,140
Neither Gabriel nor Sargon seem to think this is quite the case,

69
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:07,580
but on Sargon's side, he's jumped to it being because these characters are about social justice and are being rewarded with

70
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,980
terrible sales.

71
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,500
I have to assume the characters he mentioned so far are his examples,

72
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,700
so if we take the examples of the new Thor,

73
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,980
Hydra Cap, and Maki Bird, only that last one was cancelled. And for what it may be worth,

74
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,020
I think Maki Bird is all like Solo, Prowler,

75
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:31,740
Hellcat, Scarlet Witch, and the rest, who are Marvel characters who just can't seem to hold an ongoing title.

76
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,460
Dozens of new titles are launched every year.

77
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:39,020
In fact, most of the time they get cancelled because they just don't sell that well.

78
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,940
This is actually the cover of a Marvel magazine.

79
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,180
Civil War 2.

80
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,020
Civil War 2.

81
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
Civil War 2.

82
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:55,180
Feminism is the hegemonic ideology that they kowtow to, and if you want to enjoy Marvel comics,

83
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,580
you'd better enjoy feminism as well, because you're going to get a lot of it.

84
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,500
The fact that we're talking about Maki Bird exclusively is a strange exception,

85
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:11,020
unless you're going to tell me how a crappy Punisher knockoff like Solo is pushing a social justice agenda and had shitty sales for the same reason.

86
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,500
When it comes to female Thor, it turns out she sells pretty well, and she's actually been an overall successor of the comic.

87
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:24,540
Although Marvel has seen an overall decline, Thor has been one of the more reliable performers, consistently in the top for sales for Marvel.

88
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:31,580
That's for Hydra Cap. It's a bit early to tell how well that's selling. For what it's worth, the big,

89
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:36,220
you know, first issue of the events centered around him, for some reason

90
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,140
number zero. That was the top-selling comic in April.

91
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,420
Yeah, I don't really see Marvel being hurt by that particular social justice agenda comic.

92
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:52,140
Next, in the video, Sargon takes on some articles that have criticized Gabriel's statement by reading their headlines in a mocking tone.

93
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:56,140
He doesn't really engage with any arguments here, so it's hard to know what to address.

94
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,700
He didn't really acknowledge stuff like an endless series of event comics, an oversaturation of the number of titles,

95
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:07,660
the industry overall being in a downturn, or even stiff competition from DC Comics.

96
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:14,380
But I guess none of those are really arguments that resonates as strongly with him as William N'Jall and Social Justice Warriors.

97
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:21,660
And it's a lot easier to do that than to actually try and look at the real and many various reasons why Marvel Comics is

98
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
not doing so well right now.

99
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:29,740
Okay, the next thing we're talking about is how cringy David Key Harbor's speech was at the SAG Awards.

100
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,940
I don't know, I guess it was a little overwrought,

101
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:39,580
but maybe I'm a little less sensitive to an artist's feelings as though their work has some power to affect the world positively.

102
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:44,140
But yeah, what an asshole wanting to do something positive through entertainment.

103
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,900
Regardless of what anyone thinks of that speech, I think it'll

104
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,420
probably end up with a lot of people tuning into the second season of Stranger Things. That's just a hunch though.

105
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
Next up is Samantha Bee.

106
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:03,660
Apparently it's impossible to sit through one of her clips, so impossible that her ratings have been going up

107
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,740
by a lot. Her ratings started off humbly enough with about

108
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:10,140
900,000 viewers

109
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:16,300
since Trump's election though. Since then, her ratings have reached an average of 2.1 million.

110
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,180
In fact, she's doing so well that TBS just picked her up for another 26 episodes. So

111
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,060
I guess there's some people out there who like her.

112
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:27,500
The rest of the video is just talking shit about the new Bill Nye show.

113
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:34,460
And since that shows, ratings are unknowable since Netflix hasn't really released them. We can't really know how popular it is.

114
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:44,220
And personally, I haven't actually watched the show and I'm not really comfortable talking about it without having hard facts to back up my claims about its popularity.

115
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,660
You know, there's

116
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,660
a lesson in there somewhere for

117
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,980
someone who isn't me.

118
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,820
The video ends with some girl in a black mask promoting the level of wit displayed at a protest.

119
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,380
He doesn't really have any facts or evidence to back up his claims. He's picking and choosing what he likes to fit a particular narrative.

120
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,060
Something.

121
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:10,620
Anything to advance the notion that social justice is some kind of virus infecting media that will soon destroy it.

122
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,580
I guess he sees himself as something of a heroic figure.

123
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,260
Standing tall against the tide of social justice as it destroys all the things he doesn't care about.

124
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:25,420
But sales and ratings of this stuff doesn't seem to back it up. People actually enjoy watching and reading all this stuff and

125
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,580
you know, they seem to be able to do it without it getting the Sargon stamp of cool.

126
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,580
And

127
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,700
ultimately

128
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,060
does that really matter?

129
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,900
Sargon's voice is howling in the wilderness for a time that's slipping away when

130
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:46,380
superheroes were all white guys or when comedy didn't have a political conscience or when we all heeded the sage wisdom of a woman in a balaclava.

131
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,060
Personally, when I see media I don't like, I generally stop watching it and move on with my life.

132
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,140
Or

133
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,980
sometimes

134
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,980
write and produce an entire YouTube video.

135
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:04,300
Thanks for watching that video. If you want to see more of these old videos get unlocked, I've got at least one more.

136
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:06,380
It's very short and has me singing and

137
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,420
maybe some other stuff I will reveal.

138
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:16,780
Become one of my patrons and bring the world more videos like this, I guess. Or actually good ones I produce more regularly.

139
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:23,100
Also, you can subscribe to this channel, like, comment, etc. Follow me on twitter and curious cat questions.

140
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
I think that's about everything. Except for

141
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,940
thanks for watching.
