0	6240	Hey everyone, I am here with my promised Q&A, and I got a bunch of questions on Curious Cat,
6240	12400	and I'm gonna do my best to answer them right now. The first question. After your brilliant
12400	17120	video on Dave Rubin, thank you, there have been a number of other great video analyses covering
17120	22320	other aspects of why he and his show are so flawed and dishonest. Now that Rubin's been
22320	26800	covered so well, do you think Joe Rogan should be next to receive this treatment?
26800	32400	The Cerst did a video on his show being the start of an alt-right pipeline, but otherwise
32400	38160	there's been very little from leftist YouTube criticizing him and his show directly, mostly
38160	44400	just of individual guests on it. The real difficulty with covering Joe Rogan is that he has
44960	51520	so much content. It would take literally thousands of hours of listening to his stuff to get a sense
51520	56720	of what his show is about and how he's evolved and changed over the years. Personally, I don't have
56800	62000	the time to invest in this. If I could come up with an angle to tackle this, I would be interested
62000	68400	in doing that, but until I come up with that angle, which would mean a more focused and narrower
68400	74560	domain when it comes to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, sadly I'll have to pass on this for now,
74560	78720	but who knows what the future will bring, and if I get that right angle, I'll go for it.
79680	88000	Next question. Is municipal tap water in Canada drinkable? Yeah, generally speaking it is. In any
88000	93360	major city, you can drink the tap water and you'll be just fine. That's not always true if you live
93360	99280	on a reservation of some kind. This typically affects more remote areas of Canada, and I don't
99280	105600	know too much about this subject. The debate is generally framed as a mix of governmental
105600	111680	incompetence and corruption within the tribal system as the government's treatment of Indigenous
111680	117840	peoples in Canada has generally ranged from bad to awful. If you're in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver,
117840	123360	whatever, you're gonna be fine. Next question. What are your thoughts on the state of educational
123360	129040	television in Canada? I live in Alberta and recently our CTV2 affiliate, originally an
129040	134240	education channel for the province, stopped airing their educational programming. I don't like the
134240	140000	sound of educational programming being taken away from anywhere. Honestly, this question I don't
140000	145440	have a very good answer for, so you'll have to excuse me. Instead of giving you a half an ass,
145440	152240	kind of like, sort of maybe this, I'm gonna have to do something you don't see enough of on YouTube
152240	158080	and just say, I don't know, I'm not knowledgeable about this, and I'd have to do some real research
158080	163840	and some real digging to give you an actual answer that has some semblance of knowledge or insight
163840	168880	into the situation. Shooting from the hip about a topic I know very little about is just something
168880	176160	I don't enjoy doing, and I think it's something people should do way less of, way, way less of
176160	182880	on YouTube. Next question. Will you remember us when you're famous? I don't think I'm ever gonna
182880	188800	be famous, and I kind of like that. There are a lot of good things that come with fame, usually
188800	194000	some sort of financial stability, a lot of opportunities to do exciting and new things,
194000	200240	and I'd rather have all of those perks and none of the downsides. Fame isn't really a goal with this,
201200	207040	but if I do become famous, of course, I will remember you, anonymous question asker. How could
207040	213840	I forget? Opinion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Remember what I said about not
213840	218960	commenting on things I don't know anything about? I know nothing about this. The only
218960	224720	sentiment I could possibly offer here is that I hope this Commonwealth does right by the people
224720	230240	of Poland and Lithuania. I'm gonna not talk about it, otherwise I'm gonna be like Dave Rubin with
230240	237120	his commentary on Bolsonaro and his getting rid of the SJW stuff. No one needs that. No one needs
237120	242880	that on YouTube. Next question. Why are my YouTube recommends so terrible? I'm guessing you watched
242880	248800	a single video by, I don't know, Sargon of Akkad? Maybe you watched a quartering video? That
248800	254240	usually kills your recommendations and suddenly you're down this grotesque anti-SJW rabbit hole.
254240	259680	It's the YouTube algorithm. It's pretty garbage. I have a separate YouTube account I use for my
259680	265280	research, so it's got the worst recommendations, which helps when I'm researching a video, but
265280	269760	whenever I'm watching my own stuff I log into a different account. Why would I waste time
269760	274400	logging into an account that's just going to give me garbage videos? I'm glad people stopped
274400	278880	making those Captain Marvel videos because my recommendations for about two weeks after I made
278880	285440	that video about Get Woke Go Broke being a lie was just angry stupid. Oh Captain Marvel's gonna
285440	290560	fail videos and by the way, quick callback to that video. How much money did that make on its
290560	296880	opening weekend again? Oh yeah, like nearly half a billion dollars. So Get Woke Go Broke my ass.
296880	303120	I usually don't take a victory lap, but damn that one felt good. Next question. Dear Jose,
303680	309120	besides running a YouTube channel and correcting skeptics, what other passions do you have?
309120	314640	Favorite subjects in academia? Talents? Hobbies? Thank you for making this content and congratulations
314640	319520	for 2,500 subscribers. Thank you for the congratulations and that's four questions,
319520	325280	but since you're so nice I'm gonna answer them all. Other passions. I'm a pretty avid reader. I
325280	330800	read a lot of different types of fiction. I'm a big lover of the arts. I love creative writing.
330800	335520	I have not done nearly enough of it recently. I did a little bit today. It felt good, although
335520	341040	what I created was crap, but that's the creative process. I was trying to teach myself to draw for
341040	347680	a while. That didn't go so well, but I can still I can make decent things. I also love traveling.
347680	353200	I've been to quite a few places now. Currently my goal is to see every continent on the planet
353200	359680	except for Antarctica because of the ecological impact of tourism on that continent. Favorite
359680	365760	subjects in academia? Probably English literature. I studied it in university and adored it. I also
365760	372240	have a major in psychology, which while great, isn't quite as fun as English literature to be
372240	378480	honest. Talents. But I used to sing. I played a few instruments, never any good. Maybe writing,
378480	385200	I guess. That's kind of a talent. Hobbies. I do play a few video games, although not nearly as much
385200	391600	as I used to. Having a boring life, that's my hobby. Next question. What's your opinion on the
391600	399200	debate Nazis or don't debate Nazis debate? I think what I do on this channel is debate. And I mean
399200	406160	debate in that I confront terrible ideas with my ideas, which are not so terrible. I might even call
406160	412400	some of them good. In this channel, I try to interrogate and really test terrible ideas that
412400	420640	includes ideas not only from Nazis, but very noxious people with shitty, fascistic, wrongheaded,
420640	426560	toxic ideologies. In that sense, I am already part of the debate. What people usually refer to as a
426560	431680	debate, particularly when they're challenging me to a debate in the comment section is if I'll
431680	436720	actually take something like that seriously, is they want to have some sort of live stream
436720	441520	confrontation where people will shout at each other while trying to trip them up with these
441520	446640	silly rhetorical games and pedantic gotcha moments where they're trying to score points
446640	453280	in some sort of absurd performance that's really more a mockery of debate and discourse. I would
453280	458320	join in with the knowledge that what I am doing is not actually debating someone. This is some sort
458320	463840	of weird performance that we're engaged in for an audience that is often under the delusion that
463840	470320	they're seeing ideas clash in some sort of real-time environment. That's not really how people figure
470320	475680	out what is or isn't true. If we're talking about academia, for instance, you'll see that in the
475680	479840	literature. That's where the ideas will really come into clash and you'll see real debate happen
479840	485280	because people will have time to research and think about their responses and provide evidence.
486080	490880	We're not really set up as human beings to be debating machines where you can just
490880	497280	plop down on a stage and rattle off a bunch of facts. That's why you see these fact-free debaters
497280	502480	thrive in that environment because you can't really match them one-on-one because they don't
502480	508080	use facts to begin with. So they're just debating from their gut using their opinions and feelings
508080	512800	as if these are somehow evidence for their arguments. They aren't. They're just using
512880	517840	debating tactics to win over an audience. Apart from leftist content, would you ever put your
517840	523120	fingers in different video essay pies? My next video is going to be very much a departure and
523120	528480	a different kind of video essay. It will be technically leftist content but it's going to
528480	533360	be very different. I don't want to spoil the surprise just yet but I hope people give it a
533360	538880	shot and I think people are going to hate it or love it and really those are the only two extremes
538880	545040	I'm interested in. As for the future, I have so many ideas and things I'd love to do but I'm not
545040	551680	ready to spill the beans on those just yet. Next question. Why is your voice so damn sexy?
552640	558000	I think that's a question you can answer better than I can. I don't think my voice is anything
558000	563120	terribly special to be honest. The reason it sounds a little bassy is because I actually turn
563120	570080	up the bass a little when I'm mixing my audio. I kind of like it and I guess you do too.
571280	578160	Next question. Do you enjoy watching cartoons or animes? Not nearly as much as I used to and
578160	583440	that's more a product of just having less free time as I get older and you don't get much time
583440	589360	for watching stuff sadly but I do have a couple of cartoons I enjoy. BoJack Horseman on Netflix
589360	595040	is great. My favorite show of all time, if we're only counting seasons 2 through 9,
595040	600720	could very well be The Simpsons. I used to watch a fair amount of anime and generally fallen off
600720	606400	of that as well but my favorite TV series of all time as a complete package because it did not dip
606400	611280	in quality like The Simpsons but it was good and pure and wonderful through its entire run.
611280	616960	That is Nana. I mentioned it in my comic skate video and I will absolutely mention it again here.
616960	622560	The anime was just so good it will shatter your heart and make you a better person for having
622560	629280	had that happen. Other all-time favorite anime are my favorite movie ever Princess Mononoke and
629280	633680	really anything by Studio Ghibli but Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are two of my other
633680	639520	favorites. Cowboy Bebop is still one of my favorite shows of all time. I also loved Gundam
639520	645520	Seed, a show that is both over and underrated if that's possible. Before anyone asks I'm not
645520	649280	a huge fan of most other Gundam shows although I have watched quite a few.
650000	656080	What's your favorite meme of this year so far? I'm tempted to say the Fiji water girl was my
656080	661280	favorite but the one that made me laugh the hardest this year was the hallway pizza guy.
661280	668240	I'm gonna just play the video. Next question, are you optimistic about the future? Yes, I actually
668240	674320	am optimistic about the future. If I thought things were going badly and would continue to go badly
674320	682320	I'd probably give up so it's a practical optimism. While researching a topic that has nothing to do
682320	688000	with any of the videos I made I was learning more about millennial compensation and that increasingly
688000	693680	something millennials are finding rewarding in compensation for their employment is some sort of
693680	700000	positive social benefit. Instead of just asking for a higher salary they also enjoy compensation
700000	707200	that includes an employer that will donate money to a worthy cause or institute programs that give
707200	713840	back to the community. I think this is a signifier of the values of the younger generation coming up
713840	718240	and I really hope and believe we can hold on to these values in the future where we're not just
718240	723600	looking to make the most of our own lives in our world but improve the lives of everyone around us.
724400	728960	That's the sort of thing that makes me optimistic. Next question, how much can you lift?
729840	738880	So I only really use dumbbells and for those I'm currently at uh 22 and a half pounds for each
738880	746320	dumbbell which is okay I guess I don't know. I lift weights maybe twice a week. I'm not super
746320	753120	into it to be honest. I find other ways of staying fit. I compliment my weight lifting with a bit of
753200	760960	running some yoga and some calisthenics. Last question and it's a good one. Do the needs of the
760960	769360	many outweigh the needs of the few? Yes, yes they do. They also outweigh the needs of the one.
770400	774640	That's a Star Trek reference for everyone who doesn't know that moment in Star Trek where Spock
774640	782000	sacrifices himself to save everyone and it's pretty sad. I'm more a fan of Star Trek the next
782000	787280	generation but the original series still has its own charm and I kind of love the hokiness of it.
787920	792480	What a way to go out on a Star Trek reference. Thanks to everyone who submitted their questions
792480	796960	and if you realize you suddenly had a question for me and you wanted me to answer it but just
796960	801280	you didn't submit it you can still ask me a question just submit it on curiouscat. If you
801280	807840	love the work I'm doing consider donating to my Patreon. Those who donate five dollars or more
807840	814320	will even see their name in the credits for not the next video but the one after that. I kind of
814320	818240	explained it in the previous video if you want more details but if you're the sort of person
818240	823440	who loves seeing their name in credits this is your chance and if somehow this is the first
823440	828080	video of mine you've ever seen I've got plenty of other videos on this channel you can check out
828080	832320	and they will tell you what I'll tell you now. If you like any of my videos including this one you
832320	839040	can subscribe, like, comment. Also you can follow me on Twitter and thanks for watching.
