0	3280	This is the sort of video I make when I'm trapped inside all day.
9440	13680	As I speak, we're in the midst of a global pandemic where everyone is trying to quarantine
13680	18000	themselves away from the infectious world around them. While I'm not going to present myself as
18000	22560	someone nearly knowledgeable enough to speak as an authority on how society should be handling
22560	27440	this moment, I want to talk about how some even less qualified people are using it to
27440	32240	spread their fascist propaganda. Reactionaries of many stripes have been growing quite a bit
32240	37520	about borders lately, particularly since various nations are self-quarantining in the face of a
37520	43360	global pandemic. This somehow vindicates their long calls for closing borders. Of course,
43360	48720	closing borders during a pandemic isn't the same as stopping mass migration, which is what they're
48720	52960	always complaining about, but that's not stopping them from offering the only solution they ever
52960	58880	have in a crisis. Paul Joseph Watson gives us an example in his video, Idiots React to Coronavirus.
58880	63920	I think there's a typo in it that S should probably be behind reacts. Anyway, here's the clip.
63920	69440	The irony of singing a song about open borders after a disease has killed thousands of people
70400	78320	because of open borders. And in C-O-R-O-N-A-V-I-R-U-S sick face emoji, he has a similar take.
78320	86720	Russia, which closed its entire 2600 mile border back in January. Just 20 coronavirus cases,
86720	92320	most of which were Russians returning from Italy. Most of the victims have already recovered,
92320	98960	zero deaths. No pandemic in Russia. Strong border controls, minimal coronavirus cases.
98960	103120	What's most obnoxious about these clips is the smugness dripping out of Watson.
103680	109040	But why does he feel like he can be so smug? Since when has Paul ever spoken about the spread of a
109040	114720	pandemic? We get a better understanding of the smugness from the even more smug Stefan Molyneux
114720	119200	in his video, Coronavirus Update with Stefan Molyneux borders closed.
124480	127600	Guess the world leaders have given up on the mainstream media and now they're listening to
127600	136400	alternative media. And that may be the salvation of hundreds of thousands of people. And that is
136400	145040	a very, very powerful thing. And I'm pleased and I'm proud to have done my part in helping to save
145040	148720	thousands of lives, hundreds of thousands of lives, potentially millions around the world,
148720	153600	not a bad couple of weeks work. People in Canada, people in the West have been desperate to close
153600	162320	their borders for 20 years, more really 30 years or so. And it's here we understand what the project
162320	166800	really looks like. The pandemic is being used to foment the same anti-immigrant sentiment these
166800	170640	folks have always been using. They want us to pair the feeling of safety you might get with
170640	175440	temporary border closures with closing borders to immigration. Here's some telling anecdotes
175440	181920	Paul Joseph Watson uses in his social distancing hand emoji video. Mark D. Levine, chair of New
181920	187680	York City Council Health Committee, lauded how huge crowds gathering in New York City's Chinatown
187680	194080	was a powerful show of defiance of the coronavirus scare, tweeting four images of large groups of
194080	198960	people gathered to celebrate the occasion. Most of the attendees were Chinese and some of them
198960	204560	had almost certainly recently returned from China. And he conflates the movement of people with social
204560	210480	distancing. According to top Italian virologist Dr. Giorgio Palau, Italy's left-wing government
210480	217360	refused to isolate people coming in from China because it was seen as quote racist. That's not
217360	222640	social distancing. Of course it's important to note that immigration is not the same thing as
222640	227760	social distancing. Social distancing refers to the distance we keep between individual people
227760	233760	on a daily basis. Whether or not that person is an immigrant is irrelevant because it turns out
233760	240400	the virus doesn't actually care what your ethnicity is. Paul Joseph Watson does not want you to notice
240400	245760	the misdirection he's using here. He wants you to think of immigrants specifically and especially
245760	250400	being carriers of the virus. One thing I'd like to entangle here is that when a nation state closes
250400	254960	its borders that this is an effective way of stopping a pandemic. Even if you're someone who
254960	259200	generally likes immigration you may still be under that impression that keeping infected people out
259200	264080	of your country during a global pandemic is a good thing. For instance, Watson and Molyneux both talk
264080	269040	about how it's been so effective for Russia so we should be taking their lead on this. The truth is
269040	273280	it's a bit more complicated than that. According to the World Health Organization, closing
273280	278000	international borders in the midst of a global pandemic has a limited impact and can possibly
278000	282560	do more harm to a nation by limiting trade, particularly for nations that rely on exporting
282560	287760	their goods to keep their economy afloat. Various mathematical models suggest that isolation only
287760	292560	delays the inevitable spread of a disease and that other strategies like self-quarantining and
292560	297840	stronger health care services are more effective. And we can look at the Russia example right now.
297840	301200	Watson and Molyneux were talking about how closing down the borders was going to save
301200	306240	Russia from this incoming pandemic, but it turns out the mathematical models used by the World
306240	311440	Health Organization were much better predictors. And we can see sadly that COVID has started to
311440	316880	rise very rapidly within Russia. Turns out viruses don't necessarily stop at borders.
317680	323360	So why do nation states close their borders? In an article for Foreign Policy, Dr. Mara
323440	328160	Pillinger suggests the reason they do this isn't because they're effective on their face,
328160	332160	but rather they signal to the population that the government is taking extreme measures to
332160	335840	control the situation. And it's understandable that in a time like this, people want to think
335840	340000	that their government has things under control. But there are more important steps that need to
340000	345200	be taken, like providing health care for citizens, coordinating with scientists around the world to
345200	349760	work on treatments. There are of course benefits to restricting travel, especially when it comes
349840	354960	to social distancing and the dangers of having people crowded into buses or airplanes. And the
354960	359360	role borders play when it comes to the spread of a disease during a pandemic is an interesting and
359360	364320	important discussion. But that's not what we're talking about in these videos. We're not getting
364320	369120	a fact-based argument about border control from these guys. What we're seeing is the scapegoating
369120	375760	of immigrants and non-white populations. Immigrants are not responsible for the spread of COVID-19.
375760	379120	This shouldn't need to be said, but considering the people we're talking about here, it shouldn't
379120	383360	be surprising that immigrants are once again presented as a scapegoat. Let me go back to this
383360	387680	clip for a second. Most of the attendees were Chinese and some of them had almost certainly
387680	394000	recently returned from China. What is Paul Joseph Watson talking about here? How does he know anyone
394000	398080	in this crowd was recently in China? And if they were in China, how does he know what they were
398080	403680	exposed to? Why is he just assuming that anyone Chinese is a potential virus sector? These people
403680	408080	could very well have been born in the US, or they could have been living there for years.
408080	412480	Maybe none of them have been back to China for decades. I don't know, and the important thing
412480	418720	is neither does he. To assume that Chinese people are inherently more dangerous is, well, it's a
418720	425440	racist assumption. And for God's sake, can we focus on what matters while fighting a deadly global
425440	432240	pandemic? Can we just shut up about racism for five fucking minutes? Maybe he could help us out
432240	436480	by being less racist. If he were criticizing the actions of the Chinese government, that would be
436480	441280	fine. There's plenty of criticism to be done on that side, but he would sooner put it on the
441280	446480	Chinese people themselves, portraying everyone who's Chinese or of Chinese descent as a potential
446480	451440	threat. Paul Joseph Watson and Stefan Molyneux are part of a project to demonize people of color.
451440	455600	For all the talk you might have heard of Asian immigrants being preferable to immigrants from
455600	460240	Africa or the Middle East, the second they think they have a plausible excuse, this minority group
460240	465360	is going under the bus just as quickly. This pandemic will be used to justify portraying people
465360	470160	of Asian descent as dangerous and disease-ridden, all in an effort to create what every fascist
470160	476000	wants, an ethnostate. And we can see some of this anti-Chinese and more broadly anti-East Asian
476000	481520	sentiment manifesting itself right now. The FBI has warned of a possible surge in hate crimes in
481520	486240	the US, and in Canada there have been increased reports of Canadians of Southeast Asian descent
486240	491120	facing discrimination. Here are some words from Cynthia Choi, the co-executive director of Chinese
491120	496480	for affirmative action. We are very, very concerned in the Asian-American community that
496480	504560	this will have a lasting impact. We have yet to understand the full extent of what it will mean
504560	511200	to come out on the other side. We don't think that the anti-Asian sentiment that we're seeing now is
511200	517120	going to go away, and we're going to need to address that as a society. And make no mistake,
517120	521840	using terms like Chinese virus and the fixation of Chinese people as a threat
521840	526640	is part of a long-term game. We've been hearing echoes of this from the exact same commentators
526640	531440	for years. Here's another Paul Joseph Watson clip. This is from December of 2019 titled
531440	537360	Diversity is our strength. Now I haven't quite been able to put my finger on it, but could there
537360	543440	be some kind of connection between the relative safety of these countries and the kind of people
543440	549120	who live there? But who needs safety when you can have diversity? I know which one I choose.
549840	554400	Who needs actual borders when you can just have internal diversity barriers?
554400	558800	It's a simple video with a simple message. There need to be fewer people of color in Europe and
558800	564080	North America. Previously this was largely about Muslim immigrants and refugees capitalizing on
564080	568960	increase in anti-Muslim sentiment after September 11th, and I think this makes clear what the
568960	573600	fascist playbook looks like, because they really only have one go-to move, and that's scapegoating
573600	577840	minority groups. One thing you'll note from extremists like Watson and Molyneux is that
577840	581920	they're quite ready to criticize politicians on the left, but are far more reluctant to call up
581920	587440	politicians on the right. For example when Watson says, now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this
587440	594000	isn't a big deal, and the people who say it's just the flu are obviously downplaying the severity of
594960	599600	You'd think it would be followed by a clip like this. This is a flu. This is like a flu.
600320	604240	Well if you're familiar with Paul Joseph Watson you probably wouldn't expect him to do something
604240	608880	like that. Instead he would rather lambast politicians on the left. The reason for this
608880	613760	is because these far-right figures are more likely to find support in mainstream conservatism. Here
613760	619920	are some examples of Tucker Carlson talking about the dangers of immigration and open borders.
619920	624880	Get rid of ICE, accept most refugees, give citizenship to tens of millions of people
624880	630480	here illegally. In other words, open borders. The idea of closing borders is already popular on
630480	634960	the right, although in that case it's using immigrants as scapegoats for economic hardship.
634960	639600	The far-right piggybacks on this exact same strategy, using immigrants as scapegoats for,
639600	643680	well, pretty much everything. Watson and Molyneux are clearly afraid of angering the right-wing
643680	648480	audience, but they're still playing them. They're exploiting this crisis, comforting their audience
648480	652720	to assure them that their beloved right-wing politicians have no responsibility for their
652720	658080	government's poor response, when really politicians of all stripes have failed to one degree or another.
658080	662240	The mission of these two is to target politicians who would be greater obstacles for their far-right
662240	666640	agenda. We can see this in some of the rhetoric used by the likes of Watson. Here's an example of
666640	671760	how he ties immigration directly to the pandemic and tries to imply his stance is a more authentic
671760	677520	vision of conservatism. They all the big city LA and New York conservatives who are panicking
677600	681920	because their favorite lobster restaurants are closing and they can't cook. These are the same
681920	687200	conservatives who quietly support mass immigration because they need cheap foreign labor ethnic
687200	692720	minorities to prepare all their food. We see this approach to other problems as well. To a fascist,
692720	697680	there's no crisis in the world that is insolvable by demonizing ethnic minorities. We can see that
697680	702320	with the slow rise of eco-fascism, where elements of the far right are adopting the rhetoric of
702320	708000	environmentalists to spread their fascism. Naomi Klein spoke about this back in September of 2019.
708000	715360	I think the only thing scarier than a far-right racist movement that denies the reality of climate
715360	719840	change is a far-right racist movement that doesn't deny the reality of climate change.
719840	724160	That actually says this is happening. There are going to be many, many millions of people on the
724160	732960	move. And we are going to use this abhorrent ideology that ranks the relative value of human
732960	738720	life, that puts white Christians at the top of the hierarchy, that animalizes and otherizes everyone
738720	746800	else, as the justification for allowing those people to die. The same global response we need
746800	751680	to combat climate change is the same one we need to respond to the pandemic. And some of the rhetoric
751680	756480	used about this pandemic is already proving to be quite dangerous and ready for exploitation by
756480	762880	fascists, such as comments claiming that humanity is the virus. Now call me a radical if you must,
762880	770320	but I am pro-human. That's right, pro-human. And maybe this is just the dreamer in me, but I think
770320	775360	humans can live on this planet in a way that doesn't destroy it. What's worse about this rhetoric is
775360	780720	that it's not very difficult for a fascist to swoop in and say, yes, humans are the problem, but let's
780720	786640	just rephrase that, not all humans surely, just the wrong kinds of humans. The ones you perhaps
786640	791280	don't want to be living next to. If you're one of those people who thinks humanity is the virus,
791280	797680	you might even lean in a little more. Hmm, tell me more. And that's the trap fascists use. So we
797680	802720	need to be very careful in the strategies we use to fight pandemics and all sorts of other struggles.
802720	806480	We can stop a pandemic by working together to limit its spread and ensure that the most
807200	810800	vulnerable have access to care. And we can stop climate change by reducing emissions and helping
810800	815040	those most harmed by its effects. These are problems that require a number of different
815040	819360	approaches and all of us cooperating together. Those of us who would sooner divide us into tribes
819360	825040	to war against one another so they can create their little fiefdoms aren't worth listening to.
825040	830560	Those are the voices dragging us backwards. Much in the way conservatives only have the one joke
830560	837440	about gender they use over and over to attack trans people. Look, here's Ben Shapiro doing a
837440	845120	version of it. Good one, Ben. Fascists only have one solution to real world problems, whether it's
845120	850480	income inequality, climate change, terrorism, or a global pandemic. They always blame immigrants,
850480	855760	they always blame ethnic minorities, and they always find the most vulnerable groups to scapegoat.
855760	860080	Because they actually don't care about solving these problems. Their goal is to create an
860080	864800	ethno state and that starts by getting rid of all the people they consider undesirable.
864800	868560	We face a number of problems today and they require a number of different solutions and
868560	872880	they require us to work together as a global community. We can't stop a pandemic one nation
872880	877840	at a time. The same way we can't stop any of these other real challenges, we face as a species
877840	882880	without working together. Jose, you might be asking, what are these solutions you speak of?
883440	889520	When it comes to pandemics, listen to medical professionals rather than pundits and politicians.
889600	893440	When it comes to your own personal health care. And as for political solutions,
893440	898000	demand better access to health care. When it comes to relief packages, voice your support
898000	902640	for those that help marginalize communities and workers and people uniquely affected by this
902640	907440	pandemic. And more importantly, while we're all inside talking to one another from around the
907440	911680	world, let's try and realize that we're all in this together. That these movements we want to
911680	916320	create are ones that need to be truly global. At the end of the day, we need to be united.
916320	923280	Even if we could create our beautiful utopia here in this little patch of land we call Canada,
923280	927440	it would mean nothing to me if the rest of the world was suffering and miserable.
928320	933440	So this video was a bit of a surprise. I cooked it together pretty quickly. It's something I've
933440	937280	been looking at for the last couple of weeks and I kind of want to just say something quick about it.
937280	942320	I'm trying to make shorter videos because I think the long epics as fun as they are aren't the only
942320	946560	thing people want to see on YouTube. People like this one. I'll might make shorter commentary ones
946560	951280	like this in the future. For those of you wondering, where is the sitcom video you spoke of? Wasn't
951280	957200	that what you've been working on for the last few months? Yes. Yes, it is. And was. It's still
957200	964000	coming. Turns out a complication has arisen. It's gonna take a little bit longer to come out than I
964000	970320	expected. I hope to have it up for everyone to watch soon. When that will be, I just don't know
970320	975440	right now. But if you want to know as soon as it's up, I highly recommend following me on Twitter
975440	982320	where I will have updates. Or you can also become a patron because they'll be seen at first. You'll
982320	987040	also get their names and the credits just like you see here and all those and there's like another
987040	992400	like theme song download thing. Yeah, that's there too. If you join my Patreon, I want to add though,
992400	998080	it's a really difficult time right now for a lot of people. If you are someone who's facing some
998080	1003920	economic hardship, I want you to know I completely understand and I encourage you not to become a
1003920	1008880	patron if you're in that situation. Please take care of yourself. I'm gonna be fine. I would hate
1008880	1015120	to think someone was giving me any money and then struggling to put food on their table. That's
1015120	1020320	money I just don't want in my pocket. If you do want to support this channel, there is a thing you
1020320	1024320	can do for free. It's called hitting that like button, subscribing if you aren't already,
1024320	1030400	ringing that bell and leaving a lovely comment below. And before I leave, I'll give you one
1030400	1035840	last thing and that is my thank you for watching. Bye.
