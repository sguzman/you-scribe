00:00.000 --> 00:02.780
What makes a classic TV show?

00:02.780 --> 00:07.540
Some shows take the world by storm, becoming fan favorites remembered for generations.

00:07.540 --> 00:11.900
Others are slow starters, growing a following before reaching that tipping point of becoming

00:11.900 --> 00:14.760
a fixture on TV screens around the world.

00:14.760 --> 00:20.180
And some never reached those heights, achieving cult status among a select group of influential

00:20.180 --> 00:21.180
people.

00:21.180 --> 00:25.580
Arrested Development has a unique distinction of not only achieving that cult status, but

00:25.580 --> 00:30.280
parlaying that into a divisive return, only to have that change how people remember a

00:30.280 --> 00:33.600
series that was being called a future classic.

00:33.600 --> 00:38.080
The story of Arrested Development, a show about a family that fell apart, held together

00:38.080 --> 00:43.720
by one man, will be put together by this one man, trying to understand how we decide what

00:43.720 --> 00:46.280
makes a TV show a classic.

00:46.280 --> 00:50.880
In the early 2000s, reality television was on the ascent, and that got director and former

00:50.880 --> 00:55.320
TV star Ron Howard thinking of new ways of doing television.

00:55.320 --> 00:59.460
Something that used this reality TV grammar to tell scripted comedies with more depth

00:59.460 --> 01:02.180
and layers, while also cutting back on costs.

01:02.180 --> 01:08.060
A different kind of situation comedy that would be packed with more jokes, you know,

01:08.060 --> 01:13.660
more funny situations, and a less traditional feel than what you get with a normal kind

01:13.660 --> 01:15.180
of half hour sitcom.

01:15.180 --> 01:19.460
Through the production company he started with Brian Grazer, Imagine Entertainment, Howard

01:19.460 --> 01:24.300
approached a number of producers with this concept, and it was Mitchell Hurwitz who connected

01:24.300 --> 01:26.080
most with the idea.

01:26.080 --> 01:32.620
But I wanted to use that savings in expense and time to shoot a lot of scenes and to try

01:32.620 --> 01:41.320
to get at family enmeshment and to try to get at character that went beyond stock character.

01:41.320 --> 01:45.220
Hurwitz was particularly attracted to the idea of creating characters with greater depth

01:45.220 --> 01:47.240
than in your typical sitcom.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.260
Hurwitz had been a veteran of many sitcoms including The Golden Girls, The Golden Palace,

01:51.260 --> 01:55.000
The John Larraket Show, The Ellen Show, and several other programs that didn't start

01:55.000 --> 02:01.420
with V. One small project of note was a 1999 series called Everything's Relative which

02:01.420 --> 02:02.940
aired on NBC.

02:02.940 --> 02:06.940
Notable not just for starring Jeffrey Tambor, who would be part of the cast of Arrested

02:06.940 --> 02:11.100
Development, but also for acting as a half step between the sitcoms of the past that

02:11.100 --> 02:15.220
Hurwitz had started his career working in and what sitcoms of the future would eventually

02:15.220 --> 02:16.220
look like.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.980
It's a strange combination of the single camera style with an awkward laugh track thrown

02:19.980 --> 02:26.060
in and the plot of a comedy writer forced to make his dysfunctional family work would

02:26.060 --> 02:35.260
very much echo what would eventually become Arrested Development.

02:35.260 --> 02:39.420
Although six episodes were produced, it only ran for four before it was cancelled.

02:39.420 --> 02:44.460
But it was this project that would help inform the pitch Hurwitz took to Imagine Entertainment.

02:44.460 --> 02:49.060
Hurwitz's original idea for Arrested Development was a dysfunctional family going from riches

02:49.060 --> 02:53.020
to rags, though many of the particulars went through a number of changes before it all

02:53.020 --> 03:07.060
came together.

03:07.060 --> 03:09.820
Other aspects of the show came from Hurwitz's own life.

03:09.820 --> 03:14.340
Having grown up in California, the famous Bluth banana stand was based on a chocolate

03:14.340 --> 03:19.060
chip business he started at twelve called The Chipyard, and the street that stand began

03:19.060 --> 03:23.580
on, Balboa Boulevard, would be the name of the apartment complex that Lucille Booth would

03:23.580 --> 03:24.700
call home.

03:24.700 --> 03:29.900
The character of Maybee was even named after Hurwitz's two daughters, May and Phoebe.

03:29.900 --> 03:34.000
Outside of his own life, Hurwitz was also inspired by the Enron scandal that saw a massive energy

03:34.000 --> 03:37.460
company crumble when it committed an elaborate accounting fraud scheme.

03:37.460 --> 03:41.060
The Blue Family at the center of the series would similarly be watching their own business

03:41.060 --> 03:42.980
crumble all around them.

03:42.980 --> 03:45.460
Arrested Development was always supposed to be different.

03:45.460 --> 03:48.900
Instead of a finely polished product, rehearsed throughout the week, and then recorded on

03:48.900 --> 03:52.460
a soundstage, it would be filmed on location with little rehearsal.

03:52.460 --> 03:56.420
Scenes were written and rewritten on the fly, and the look of the show mimicked a documentary,

03:56.420 --> 04:00.900
one shot with two cameras, often moving through scenes scrambling to get reactions.

04:00.900 --> 04:05.660
Jason Bateman was cast as Michael Bluth, the one son holding the Bluth family together.

04:05.660 --> 04:09.260
Bateman's first on-screen acting job was at the age of twelve on Little House on the

04:09.260 --> 04:10.260
Prairie.

04:10.260 --> 04:13.140
He wanted to appear in Silver Spoons and It's Your Move.

04:13.140 --> 04:17.900
Throughout the 90s, he had a series of failed TV pilots, creating some reluctance to cast

04:17.900 --> 04:18.900
him as Michael.

04:18.900 --> 04:22.860
But when he auditioned, they found he was the perfect fit for the relatively level-headed

04:22.860 --> 04:27.360
member of the Bluth family, the man who wants nothing more than to leave that family, only

04:27.360 --> 04:29.940
to be constantly dragged back into their drama.

04:29.940 --> 04:34.620
They are going to keep Dad in prison, at least until this gets all sorted out.

04:34.620 --> 04:37.900
Also, the attorney said that they're going to have to put a halt in the company's expense

04:37.900 --> 04:38.900
account.

04:38.900 --> 04:43.060
Interesting, I would have expected that after they're keeping Dad in jail.

04:43.060 --> 04:46.660
Portia de Rossi was cast as Lindsay Bluth, Michael's twin sister.

04:46.660 --> 04:51.780
De Rossi had made her debut in the 1994 movie, Sirens, and before Arrested Development, she

04:51.780 --> 04:53.740
was a regular on Ally McBeal.

04:53.740 --> 04:58.180
As Lindsay, she was the socialite who spent more time creating the illusion of being a

04:58.180 --> 05:01.900
philanthropist than actually doing anything aside from shopping.

05:01.900 --> 05:04.500
I'm kind of the charitable one of the family.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.300
I think it's best if you got a job.

05:06.300 --> 05:09.660
Oh come on, I'm a parent, I care about my daughter every bit as much as Michael cares

05:09.660 --> 05:10.660
about his son.

05:10.660 --> 05:13.340
What grade am I in?

05:13.340 --> 05:14.340
What kind of job?

05:14.340 --> 05:19.620
Will Arnett played the eldest of the Bluth siblings, George Oscar Bluth Jr. or Job.

05:19.620 --> 05:23.900
Job was one of the tougher roles to be cast, with none of the actors auditioning, managing

05:23.900 --> 05:26.020
to find a suitable voice for the character.

05:26.020 --> 05:31.460
Arnett, who only had a few credits to his name, most notably two episodes on The Sopranos,

05:31.460 --> 05:36.260
managed to breathe life into the impossibly arrogant and intensely vulnerable Job.

05:36.260 --> 05:38.260
And Job is quite the magician.

05:38.260 --> 05:40.260
This is the magic trick, huh?

05:40.260 --> 05:41.260
Illusion, Michael.

05:41.260 --> 05:43.860
Mmm, trick is something a whore does for money.

05:43.860 --> 05:47.140
Michael Cera was cast as Michael's son, George Michael.

05:47.140 --> 05:51.860
Only 15 by the time Arrested Development premiered, he had already appeared in several movies

05:51.860 --> 05:53.340
and TV shows.

05:53.340 --> 05:57.140
George Michael is the timid, well-meaning teen who is struggling to grow up with a

05:57.140 --> 05:59.420
father who doesn't quite get him.

05:59.420 --> 06:03.460
George Michael is also nursing a confusing attraction to his cousin.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.940
I'm tempted to kiss again so we can teach him a lesson.

06:06.940 --> 06:07.940
Why would that teach them a lesson?

06:07.940 --> 06:10.140
No, I mean, to freak them out.

06:10.140 --> 06:12.980
Yeah, but that doesn't make any sense.

06:12.980 --> 06:14.980
Well, isn't that what makes it funny?

06:14.980 --> 06:15.980
I'm laughing.

06:15.980 --> 06:19.140
Let's go fish, you know.

06:19.140 --> 06:23.580
Alia Shawkat was cast as maybe Funke, Lindsay's daughter.

06:23.580 --> 06:27.260
Even though she was only 14 when the show debuted, she'd already come off a nearly

06:27.260 --> 06:30.520
40-episode run on the series State of Grace.

06:30.520 --> 06:35.440
She is bolder than her cousin, seeming to lack much empathy as her antics fail to catch

06:35.440 --> 06:48.880
the attention of her absent-minded parents.

06:48.880 --> 06:54.280
Tony Hill was cast as the youngest Bluth sibling, Byron Bluth, better known as Buster.

06:54.280 --> 06:59.040
Relatively unknown at the time, Hill had guest spots on a few programs, but Arrested Development

06:59.040 --> 07:01.040
would be his first major role.

07:01.040 --> 07:05.400
Buster is an extremely awkward mother boy who spends much of the series in a state

07:05.400 --> 07:08.680
of perpetual confusion.

07:08.680 --> 07:27.560
David Cross played Tobias Funke, Lindsay's husband and maybe his father, although creator

07:27.560 --> 07:32.800
Mitch Hurwitz claims to have offered the well-traveled stand-up Cross any role he wanted,

07:32.800 --> 07:36.800
Cross said it was the roles of Job and Buster that were suggested to him.

07:36.800 --> 07:40.280
Regardless, it was Tobias that spoke to Cross as a character.

07:40.280 --> 07:43.440
After a beef struggle with the network to make sure Tobias would have what would be

07:43.440 --> 07:47.840
his signature mustache, Cross slipped into the role of a former therapist turned actor

07:47.840 --> 07:56.560
who had a very unusual way of choosing his words.

07:56.560 --> 08:00.720
Jeffrey Tambor was originally asked to only play the role of family patriarch George

08:00.720 --> 08:05.520
Oscar Bluth Sr. for a single episode, but the role was such a good fit for Tambor that

08:05.520 --> 08:08.960
he jumped at the chance to become part of the principal cast.

08:08.960 --> 08:13.720
A veteran and beloved from his time as Hank Kingsley on The Larry Sanders Show, Tambor

08:13.720 --> 08:18.520
created a George Sr. that was both domineering and slimy, all from the comfort of his prison

08:18.520 --> 08:28.600
cell.

08:28.600 --> 08:33.800
Jessica Walter made up the final member of the principal cast as Lucille Bluth, the sharp-tongued

08:33.800 --> 08:36.040
matriarch of the Bluth family.

08:36.040 --> 08:40.400
Having been acting for over 40 years, Walter was the most experienced of the cast, notably

08:40.400 --> 08:44.440
appearing in Clint Eastwood's directorial debut, Play Misty for Me.

08:44.440 --> 08:48.320
Lucille Bluth is a woman so wealthy and out of touch with the common man that she has

08:48.320 --> 08:59.600
trouble acclimating to her family's new financial reality.

08:59.600 --> 09:03.640
Although technically not a member of the cast, Arrested Development did have a regular narrator

09:03.640 --> 09:05.840
voiced by Ron Howard.

09:05.840 --> 09:09.160
Originally Howard was only a placeholder, but his performance as a detached narrator

09:09.160 --> 09:13.320
was so effective and was very charming to the network, he became a permanent fixture

09:13.440 --> 09:14.440
for the series.

09:14.440 --> 09:19.840
I actually borrowed from National Geographic.

09:19.840 --> 09:28.440
I thought it should be approached with a kind of a sociological or anthropological mindset.

09:28.440 --> 09:37.200
I think this is the same narrator who would be doing something about the indigenous inhabitants

09:37.200 --> 09:41.000
of the Amazon basin, and then their next job would be to come and talk about the Bluth

09:41.000 --> 09:51.520
family.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.480
Arrested Development had a very rich world of recurring characters, and it would be nearly

09:56.480 --> 09:58.600
impossible to list all of them here.

09:58.600 --> 10:02.720
But the ones who appeared most frequently were the family's lawyer Barry Zuckercorn,

10:02.720 --> 10:07.240
played by Henry Winkler, news anchor John Beard, a local Los Angeles news anchor who

10:07.240 --> 10:11.680
was portraying a fictionalized version of himself, Liza Minnelli as Lucille Bluth's

10:11.680 --> 10:17.240
rival, Lucille Austero, also known as Lucille II, Mae Whitman, played George Michael's

10:17.240 --> 10:22.960
season 2 love interest Ann Veal, and Justin Grant Wade, appeared as high school jock,

10:22.960 --> 10:23.960
Steve Holt.

10:23.960 --> 10:37.920
There was also this mysterious janitor, played by Martin Moll.

10:37.920 --> 10:44.640
He always gets me to Gene Parmesan, how could I forget him?

10:44.640 --> 10:50.480
Debuting on November 2nd, 2003, in an episode titled, Pilot, we meet the Bluth family just

10:50.480 --> 11:00.760
as it seems as though it's ready to fall apart.

11:00.760 --> 11:05.160
The cast is introduced through some narration and a few key interactions, and we find out

11:05.160 --> 11:09.720
that this episode is about Michael being snubbed for a partnership at his family's business

11:09.720 --> 11:19.200
shortly before George Sr. is arrested.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.300
The family looks to Michael to run the business.

11:22.300 --> 11:44.560
Even though he wants to leave for the sake of his son, he stays behind.

11:44.560 --> 11:49.060
Of course George Michael might also be motivated by the new crush he has on his cousin, Mae

11:49.060 --> 12:00.100
B.

12:00.100 --> 12:03.740
This along with many character dynamics would be explored throughout the season.

12:03.740 --> 12:08.680
Unlike other sitcoms that tended to keep a fixed premise and placed it in novel situations

12:08.680 --> 12:13.540
in each episode, Arrested Development would introduce dynamics that would run and change

12:13.540 --> 12:16.080
as we followed the adventures of the Bluths.

12:16.080 --> 12:19.500
Perhaps this would mean dynamics that ran through the entire series, sometimes only

12:19.500 --> 12:22.360
for a season or even just a few episodes.

12:22.360 --> 12:26.040
George Michael's crush on his cousin went the distance, sometimes becoming the focus

12:26.040 --> 12:30.040
of his character and other times just humming along in the background, but it was always

12:30.040 --> 12:33.880
safe to assume that, no matter where you are in the series, George Michael is harboring

12:33.880 --> 12:47.120
some feelings for Mae B.

12:47.120 --> 12:51.300
The pilot was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, and you may be more familiar with their

12:51.300 --> 12:53.680
work on the highest grossing movie of all time.

12:53.680 --> 12:57.600
They were a major part of establishing the look of Arrested Development, using a cinema

12:57.600 --> 13:02.260
verite style to create the impression of a documentary crew in the thick of it.

13:02.260 --> 13:06.860
If the series looks like it was Mae cheaply, that was by design, as multi-camera sitcoms

13:06.860 --> 13:10.140
at the time were becoming increasingly expensive to produce.

13:10.140 --> 13:14.060
The quick cuts and rushed production meant that footage sometimes lacked the polish to

13:14.060 --> 13:17.900
tell a coherent story, which is part of the reason a narrator was used to fill in the

13:17.900 --> 13:18.900
gaps.

13:18.900 --> 13:37.460
This was a necessity, with shows often having

13:37.460 --> 13:41.780
thirty minutes of footage needing to be cut down to twenty-two minutes for broadcast.

13:41.780 --> 13:45.580
It was often suggested that this might be attributed to the actor's improving, and

13:45.580 --> 13:49.500
while this was the original intention of the series, the writing was so strong that

13:49.500 --> 13:52.140
very little of that happened as the series progressed.

13:52.140 --> 13:55.820
Alternate takes often came from writers coming up with new jokes on the spot.

13:55.820 --> 13:59.540
New jokes and missing plot points were also recorded after the fact.

13:59.540 --> 14:14.540
Later inserted into scenes, while a speaking character's back is turned to the camera.

14:14.540 --> 14:18.340
In addition to the structure and style of the series, the pilot also establishes some

14:18.340 --> 14:22.020
important ways it would differentiate itself from other sitcoms.

14:22.020 --> 14:25.980
Families that don't get along weren't an entirely novel concept at this point, even

14:25.980 --> 14:28.500
if the opposite were still more common.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.740
But arrested development added some subjects to the idea by placing Michael and his son

14:32.740 --> 14:37.940
in a literal fake home, a model home created by the Bluth Company to sell their new development

14:37.940 --> 14:39.900
project, Sudden Valley.

14:39.900 --> 14:43.900
One of the big charms of the series was its ability to take seemingly meaningless jokes,

14:43.900 --> 14:48.620
references, and build on them several episodes or several seasons later.

14:48.620 --> 14:53.100
Sometimes it was just a running gag, but sometimes it also meant expanding on a moment to create

14:53.100 --> 14:54.540
an entire plotline.

14:54.540 --> 14:59.820
An example from the pilot is Michael interviewing for a new job at Sitwell Housing.

14:59.820 --> 15:04.380
What was originally just a placeholder company was later revealed to be a major rival to

15:04.380 --> 15:08.620
the Bluth Company, led by Stan Sitwell, played by Ed Begley Jr.

15:08.620 --> 15:16.340
Themetically, the show also had some interesting

15:16.340 --> 15:21.100
things to say about how the upper class are often just as silly as the rest of us and

15:21.100 --> 15:25.340
got to where they were by being willing to step over others and each other.

15:25.340 --> 15:28.380
And there's the very interesting fusion between family and business throughout the

15:28.380 --> 15:32.700
series, connecting love and commerce with disastrous consequences.

15:32.700 --> 15:36.540
When George Sr. tells Michael that he didn't promote him to protect him, we find out it

15:36.540 --> 15:38.780
wasn't purely out of concern for his son.

16:02.700 --> 16:07.100
And as we'll see throughout the series, the Bluths are never beneath screwing one

16:07.100 --> 16:11.740
another over for financial gain, or in some cases, to protect the company.

16:11.740 --> 16:16.300
The pilot episode for Arrested Development did so much heavy lifting I can't possibly

16:16.300 --> 16:20.460
cover it all here, and the rest of the series is similarly dense.

16:20.460 --> 16:24.340
As we'll see as we move forward, this was often weighed more to its complexity rather

16:24.340 --> 16:28.820
than its depth, and it was the show's complexity that played a role in it becoming a revered

16:28.820 --> 16:32.300
classic that struggled to find a wider audience.

16:32.300 --> 16:36.140
One of the central dynamics of the series, especially in its first season, is the struggle

16:36.140 --> 16:39.080
between the Bluth siblings and their parents.

16:39.080 --> 16:43.140
One of the ways it manifests itself is in the rivalry between Job and Michael.

16:43.140 --> 16:47.380
Job and Michael butt heads in the early episode over Job's girlfriend, Marta, played by

16:47.380 --> 16:51.860
Leonor Varela, and then later by Patricia Velasquez when scheduling conflicts arose

16:51.860 --> 16:53.020
for the first actress.

16:53.020 --> 16:56.220
Job's attitude towards his girlfriend is less than attractive.

16:56.220 --> 17:10.260
On the other hand, Michael is completely smitten with Marta, and he's conflicted

17:10.260 --> 17:25.340
over the fact that he wants to date his brother's girlfriend.

17:25.340 --> 17:29.860
As Marta develops feelings for Michael, she's overheard expressing them to her mother by

17:29.860 --> 17:34.660
Job.

17:34.660 --> 17:45.340
Spanish speakers are probably head of the joke on this one.

17:45.340 --> 17:48.540
Job and Michael come to blows in the following episode.

17:48.540 --> 18:02.020
Finally Marta becomes a real character, realizing the Bluths are awful.

18:02.020 --> 18:05.820
This rejection brings the two together, until we see them at each other's throats over

18:05.820 --> 18:20.140
who gets to run the company.

18:20.140 --> 18:23.420
Throughout this stretch of episodes in the first half of season one, there's very little

18:23.420 --> 18:27.580
that Marta does except play the dutiful and eventually conflicted girlfriend.

18:27.580 --> 18:32.180
It's hard to understand what she ever saw in Job, and that a few gestures from Michael

18:32.180 --> 18:37.180
sweep her off her feet make her seem as though this is a woman, who is a successful actress

18:37.180 --> 18:41.620
by the way, who has had some underwhelming experiences with romance.

18:41.620 --> 18:45.260
What it also reveals is that she's more of a prop being passed around so we can learn

18:45.260 --> 18:47.980
more about the relationship between Michael and Job.

18:47.980 --> 18:52.340
That this eventually gets replaced by who gets to be in charge of the company reveals

18:52.340 --> 18:56.940
that their rivalry is a product of their own bitter feelings towards one another, and also

18:56.940 --> 18:59.860
how inconsequential Marta was as a character.

18:59.860 --> 19:04.380
The joke about confusing the word hermano for a name also reveals just how horribly

19:04.380 --> 19:06.260
self-absorbed these characters are.

19:06.260 --> 19:10.700
It's a word that should come very easily to anyone with a Spanish-speaking girlfriend.

19:10.700 --> 19:16.860
But Job is completely oblivious, and Michael, for as charmed as he supposedly is by Marta,

19:16.860 --> 19:26.940
can't be bothered to learn the language he speaks, although he does sort of try.

19:26.940 --> 19:30.940
Michael and Job's rivalry isn't the only dynamic we see in these early episodes though.

19:30.940 --> 19:35.180
We also get a glimpse of the grotesque as we learn about the relationship between Buster

19:35.180 --> 19:44.740
and Lucille.

19:44.740 --> 19:49.700
Third dynamic is created by Lucille's need to be needed, and Buster is the one paying

19:49.700 --> 19:51.700
the price for that need.

19:51.700 --> 19:55.360
Buster breaks away from his mother by becoming romantically involved with Lucille's best

19:55.360 --> 20:06.760
friend and rival, Lucille Ostero.

20:06.760 --> 20:10.600
While this gesture from Buster wasn't entirely intentional, he was supposed to be bidding

20:10.600 --> 20:15.200
on his mother, Buster and Lucille too do develop their own strange dynamic.

20:15.200 --> 20:43.640
Lucille fights back by replacing Buster with a boy adopted from Korea, An-Yong.

20:43.640 --> 20:46.320
An-Yong is the Korean word for hello.

20:46.320 --> 20:50.160
The parallel here between An-Yong and Marta is pretty clear – they're both pawns in

20:50.160 --> 20:52.480
the game the Blue Family is playing.

20:52.480 --> 20:57.120
Mark that way by not only being outside the family, but outside the broader cultural context

20:57.120 --> 20:58.720
the Blues find themselves in.

20:58.720 --> 21:03.720
In contrast, Lucille too is a far more developed character, because she lives in that white

21:03.720 --> 21:07.640
upper-class world – the world the series is giving us a glimpse into.

21:07.640 --> 21:12.760
It reveals the general disinterest these people have for those who are outside their bubble.

21:12.760 --> 21:19.920
Even though An-Yong hangs around until the end of the series, the number of appearances

21:19.920 --> 21:24.800
he makes dwindles as time goes on, and his role in the finale is more of a bit part for

21:24.800 --> 21:28.360
a character who is ostensibly part of the Bluth family.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.680
In that way, along with basically reusing the same joke about the Bluths not understanding

21:32.680 --> 21:37.360
a word spoken in another language, the show reveals itself to be part of that same world

21:37.360 --> 21:41.880
as the Bluths, concerned with the Bluth family but not so much with the people they step

21:41.880 --> 21:42.880
on.

21:42.880 --> 21:44.680
They're just there to prove a point.

21:44.680 --> 21:48.760
The Bluth siblings are very much aware of how their parents have messed up their lives.

21:48.760 --> 21:52.240
They even bond with Buster when he dares to criticize their mother.

21:52.240 --> 21:56.680
I'm mom and I want to shoot down everything you say so I feel good about myself.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.680
Look who's ragging on the old lady.

21:58.680 --> 21:59.680
Hey!

21:59.680 --> 22:00.680
Finally!

22:00.680 --> 22:01.680
I'm an uptight ******!

22:01.680 --> 22:02.680
Buster!

22:02.680 --> 22:03.680
******!

22:03.680 --> 22:06.680
You old horny slut!

22:06.680 --> 22:18.000
Well no one's gonna top that.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.240
Lucille Bluth is not likely to win Mother of the Year.

22:21.240 --> 22:24.680
In the first season, she even attempts to pin a car accident that was absolutely her

22:24.680 --> 22:26.200
fault on Michael.

22:26.200 --> 22:30.840
The original premise of the series was a family alienated from one another by its wealth,

22:30.840 --> 22:32.360
learning how to get along.

22:32.360 --> 22:36.460
While the first half of that statement is present, the second half never quite comes

22:36.460 --> 22:37.460
to fruition.

22:37.460 --> 22:41.260
They're more a family stuck together sharing their misery, and Lucille is the perfect

22:41.260 --> 22:42.740
representative of that.

22:42.740 --> 22:47.180
Lucille is completely out of touch with the world outside of her wealthy socialite bubble.

22:47.180 --> 22:49.180
I mean it's one banana, Michael.

22:49.180 --> 22:50.180
What could it cost?

22:50.180 --> 22:51.180
Ten dollars?

22:51.180 --> 22:55.700
While lines like that reveal Lucille's detachment from the wider world, her relationship with

22:55.700 --> 23:00.940
her children is similarly detached, held together not through love, but through manipulation.

23:00.940 --> 23:03.940
I just want my children to love me.

23:03.940 --> 23:04.940
Stop lying.

23:04.940 --> 23:05.940
Stop manipulating.

23:05.940 --> 23:06.940
Just be nicer.

23:06.940 --> 23:07.940
What?

23:07.940 --> 23:08.940
I'm a horrible mother.

23:08.940 --> 23:09.940
No, no, my, you crazy mother.

23:09.940 --> 23:10.940
That's crazy, Todd.

23:10.940 --> 23:11.940
You're a fantastic mother.

23:11.940 --> 23:12.940
You're the mother.

23:12.940 --> 23:18.940
George Sr. isn't a whole lot better.

23:18.940 --> 23:32.380
While he may be in jail for most of the first season, his brief trips out of prison reveal

23:32.380 --> 23:36.340
someone less interested in the welfare of his family and more about keeping himself

23:36.340 --> 23:38.060
from being locked up for good.

23:38.060 --> 23:40.980
George Sr. is a patriarch in many senses of the word.

23:40.980 --> 23:45.340
Head of the family, head of the company, and he literally portrays God in one episode.

23:45.340 --> 23:49.740
Although when he uses that opportunity to make his escape, the episode very cutely reveals

23:49.740 --> 23:58.380
that this is a world where you can't trust in even a heavenly father.

23:58.380 --> 24:02.860
George Sr. and Lucille are, quite clearly, awful parents, and the show is very clear

24:02.860 --> 24:06.060
to present them as two people not to be trusted.

24:06.060 --> 24:10.940
And more than just bad parents, they represent authority and status more broadly, being wealthy

24:10.940 --> 24:12.820
and running the Bluth Company.

24:12.820 --> 24:17.740
George Sr. as a boss is tough to get a grasp on since he's arrested in the first episode

24:17.740 --> 24:22.460
of the series, but the culture created at the Bluth Company is one set up for a domineering

24:22.460 --> 24:27.260
boss to control his employees the way a domineering father controls his children.

24:27.260 --> 24:32.500
For example, using former employee J. Walter Weatherman, played by Steve Ryan, to teach

24:32.500 --> 24:46.820
his kids lessons.

24:46.820 --> 24:50.260
When the younger Bluths step into positions of authority, rather than commiserating with

24:50.260 --> 24:54.780
the workers knowing what it's like for George Sr. and Lucille to treat them like children,

24:54.780 --> 24:57.180
they instead adopt the role of their parents.

24:57.180 --> 25:07.420
When Michael takes charge of the company, he leads his employees around like sheep.

25:07.420 --> 25:17.700
The Bluths also have family discussions in front of them, as if they aren't even there.

25:17.700 --> 25:22.100
Job even organizes the workers not to improve their conditions, but instead to undermine

25:22.100 --> 25:35.220
Michael as the one in charge.

25:35.220 --> 25:39.180
And going back to Michael, even though he's presented as the responsible one, he expects

25:39.180 --> 25:44.300
his workers to work without getting paid, something that reveals a deep level of disrespect

25:44.300 --> 25:46.580
even from the normal Bluth.

25:46.580 --> 25:50.540
In spite of whatever hardships the Bluths place on one another, they still adhere to

25:50.540 --> 25:56.020
their social standing, even when those hardships should be teaching them another lesson entirely.

25:56.020 --> 26:00.780
What they learn is to not stand in solidarity with the oppressed, but to claim their birthright

26:00.780 --> 26:02.220
as oppressors.

26:02.220 --> 26:14.540
Early in the season, Michael discovers a truth about his father.

26:14.540 --> 26:19.060
Michael knew his father was guilty of something, but he had no idea it was this bad.

26:19.060 --> 26:23.460
And that's another recurring theme of this series, people who seem bad being revealed

26:23.460 --> 26:25.100
as even worse.

26:25.100 --> 26:30.940
One late addition in season 1 was George Senior's identical twin brother, Oscar George Bluth.

26:30.940 --> 26:34.900
The introduction of Oscar came about because creator Mitch Hurwitz happened to see Jeffrey

26:34.900 --> 26:37.880
Tambor in a wig, and he thought it looked interesting.

26:37.880 --> 26:42.100
So Oscar was written into the show, giving Tambor two recurring characters to play, which

26:42.100 --> 26:46.700
is a pretty big step up from initially being cast to a single episode guest role.

26:46.700 --> 26:51.020
The reason the Bluth company looms so heavily over the family, defining their relationships,

26:51.020 --> 26:54.980
and shaping their goals, is in part because aside from Michael, none of them have a sense

26:54.980 --> 27:05.820
for business.

27:05.820 --> 27:10.660
This is a family that has largely lived off the largesse of the unethical George Senior,

27:10.660 --> 27:13.620
never having to consider what living in the real world means.

27:13.620 --> 27:17.500
Throughout season 1, we see how this dynamic has created a family unable to do more than

27:17.500 --> 27:20.260
occasionally band together against an outside threat.

27:20.260 --> 27:24.300
The rest of the time, they spend bickering and plotting against each other to take control

27:24.300 --> 27:28.060
of the company, out of fear that this loss of power will mean they will have to know

27:28.060 --> 27:36.900
what it feels like to not be rich.

27:36.900 --> 27:40.900
Family isn't there for love or comfort, so much as they're there to help make you

27:40.900 --> 27:41.900
money.

27:41.900 --> 27:45.420
It's very clearly in this episode where it's revealed that George Senior monetized

27:45.420 --> 27:50.380
the rivalry between Job and Michael in a series of tapes called Boy Fights.

27:50.380 --> 27:54.140
And more than the alienation caused by their wealth, we see how the Bluth company is so

27:54.140 --> 27:57.620
concerned with making money that they're willing to deal with a dictator like Saddam

27:57.620 --> 27:58.620
Hussein.

27:58.620 --> 28:22.060
Wealth and the pursuit of it has shattered every part of the lives of the Bluth family.

28:22.060 --> 28:26.060
They don't trust one another, they live in deluded fantasies about themselves, and

28:26.060 --> 28:30.100
have created a company whose workers have been conditioned to behave like children.

28:30.100 --> 28:34.200
In short, the Bluths represent everything bad about a society fueled by greed, living

28:34.200 --> 28:38.380
in a twisted version of the American greed that creates parodies of families as a means

28:38.380 --> 28:39.660
to financial gain.

28:39.660 --> 28:44.340
It's almost mocking any workplace where a boss will come in and tell everyone, we're

28:44.340 --> 28:45.340
like a family.

28:45.340 --> 28:49.220
Except it's a family where a father controls all the children and takes most of the money

28:49.220 --> 28:50.580
for himself.

28:50.580 --> 28:54.620
In the season finale, Michael once again wants to leave his family, only for circumstances

28:54.620 --> 28:56.560
to convince him to stay.

28:56.560 --> 29:18.540
With his trial still some time away, George Sr. seemingly has a heart attack and is hospitalized.

29:18.540 --> 29:23.100
And that's when the family realized that George Sr. wasn't dead, but was fleeing

29:23.100 --> 29:28.020
the country that he loved so very much.

29:28.020 --> 29:32.220
This is a nice setup for the next season, which is as good a segue as any to talk about

29:32.220 --> 29:41.100
another unique trait of the series, the previews for the next episode.

29:41.100 --> 29:45.540
What was especially fun about these is they almost never appeared in the next episode,

29:45.540 --> 29:49.380
rather they were fun jokes for an episode to end on, playing on whatever happened in

29:49.380 --> 29:50.380
the episode itself.

29:50.820 --> 29:54.140
These were originally added because Mitch Hurwitz wanted to get test audiences to say

29:54.140 --> 29:57.180
they wanted to see what would happen on the next episode.

29:57.180 --> 30:01.100
These previews also reveal a loose relationship with continuity, something the series would

30:01.100 --> 30:06.140
be less comfortable with as time went on.

30:06.140 --> 30:10.900
The first season of Arrested Development was about establishing its style and tone, demanded

30:10.900 --> 30:16.260
much of viewers to follow plotlines and jokes through many twists and turns, all to arrive

30:16.260 --> 30:22.080
at the core of a series that had a basic message of how wealth can poison a family.

30:22.080 --> 30:26.020
It was a very new way of presenting an old message, and it was that pairing of a new

30:26.020 --> 30:29.300
style and familiar message that won the attention of critics.

30:29.300 --> 30:33.660
Here's an example of a review of the first episode from a writer at the New York Times

30:33.660 --> 30:35.780
shortly before the show premiered.

30:35.780 --> 30:41.020
The Bluth heirs are eccentric and warped, but they are not hothouse child prodigies

30:41.020 --> 30:42.980
like the Tenenbaum siblings.

30:42.980 --> 30:48.500
They are nouveau riche misfits, the ewings of Dallas as seen by Bunuel, and they are

30:48.500 --> 30:50.900
quite amusing.

30:50.900 --> 30:54.300
As the year went on, critics became increasingly enamored with the show.

30:54.300 --> 30:57.740
At the TV Land Awards, it won the Future Classic Award.

30:57.740 --> 31:00.940
It wasn't the best predictor for classic television.

31:00.940 --> 31:05.160
For every year in which it would go to a massive hit like The Office, there would be other

31:05.160 --> 31:08.740
years where it would go to flash in the pans like Heroes.

31:08.740 --> 31:12.960
That said, the award meant enough to Arrested Development that the acceptance speech may

31:12.960 --> 31:16.240
be nominated on to the first season DVD release of the show.

31:16.240 --> 31:19.920
This sentiment would be carried by critics all the way into the Emmys, where Arrested

31:19.920 --> 31:23.440
Development was nominated for four awards and won three.

31:23.440 --> 31:27.400
Mitch Hurwitz won for writing in a comedy series, The Russo Brothers won for directing

31:27.400 --> 31:31.680
in a comedy series, and the show itself won Best Comedy Series, beating out the likes

31:31.680 --> 31:37.480
of Curb Your Enthusiasm, Everybody Loves Raymond, Sex in the City, and Will and Grace.

31:37.480 --> 31:41.520
Special attention should be given to how Hurwitz ended his acceptance speech for Best Comedy

31:41.520 --> 31:45.880
Series.

31:45.880 --> 31:50.800
Saying let's watch it was a reminder that, in this absolute love-bomb of critical praise

31:50.800 --> 31:55.440
from the TV critics, very few people were actually watching the show, a sentiment that

31:55.440 --> 31:57.920
can be seen during interviews at the time.

31:57.920 --> 32:02.480
My dream has always been to work on a show, regardless of what that show is, that holds

32:02.480 --> 32:13.920
Malcolm's numbers, and if it doesn't happen, you move on, you move on.

32:13.920 --> 32:16.640
So just how bad were the ratings?

32:16.640 --> 32:20.560
While the first episode debuted to just under 8 million viewers, by the end of the first

32:20.560 --> 32:23.400
season it was down to less than 6.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.880
Its average for the year was 6.2 million viewers.

32:26.880 --> 32:31.400
Its lead-in, Malcolm in the Middle, while not a ratings juggernaut, was still doing significantly

32:31.400 --> 32:36.040
better beginning the season with 10 million viewers, ending with 8 million viewers, and

32:36.040 --> 32:39.640
having an average of 8.35 million viewers.

32:39.640 --> 32:43.880
There was a small uptake in the ratings on March 17th when the show was given the coveted

32:43.880 --> 32:49.200
spot following American Idol, giving the show its highest rating ever with 9.6 million viewers.

32:49.200 --> 32:52.840
But even though this one episode was moved to the middle of the week for a one-off attempt

32:52.840 --> 32:57.640
to garner a new audience, it ended up losing nearly 60% of the people who were watching

32:57.640 --> 32:58.800
American Idol.

32:58.800 --> 33:03.040
And looking at ratings for the following weeks, it seems none of that 3 million audience

33:03.040 --> 33:08.040
surplus seemed to follow Arrested Development back to its Sunday night time slot.

33:08.040 --> 33:14.040
Aside from cops, Arrested Development was the lowest-rated show on Fox not to get cancelled.

33:14.040 --> 33:17.680
In overall viewing numbers, it was ranked 105th.

33:17.680 --> 33:20.180
Things weren't looking good ratings-wise.

33:20.180 --> 33:24.840
In an article from Entertainment Weekly, some concerns were expressed by the network.

33:24.840 --> 33:29.080
Fox Entertainment president Gail Berman admits Arrested Development's numbers are

33:29.080 --> 33:30.080
troubling.

33:30.080 --> 33:33.800
Still, she insists the network is an abandoning hope.

33:33.800 --> 33:34.800
Yet.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.880
Look, I love this show, she says.

33:36.880 --> 33:40.160
We're trying to figure out every possible way we can help it.

33:40.160 --> 33:44.360
Hurwitz in interviews years later expressed that he believed the network was considering

33:44.360 --> 33:48.640
cancelling the show but only relented after all of the critical acclaim, particularly

33:48.640 --> 33:51.280
because of the awards it was winning.

33:51.280 --> 33:53.760
Therefore they felt like they had to keep it on the air.

33:53.800 --> 33:57.880
By winning the Emmy for Best Comedy series, along with two others, it was hoped that these

33:57.880 --> 34:02.240
successes would turn things around for the series, giving it a bigger profile, attracting

34:02.240 --> 34:05.920
a wider audience, and telling a huge comeback story.

34:05.920 --> 34:09.200
They didn't, but it would have been.

34:09.200 --> 34:12.880
Season 2 opens with Michael heading back to the family because he isn't sure they really

34:12.880 --> 34:15.280
got how serious he was about leaving.

34:15.280 --> 34:17.840
I think we're still there.

34:17.840 --> 34:18.840
We're going back.

34:18.840 --> 34:23.560
Michael is once again trapped with his family, only now he's implicated in George Sr's

34:23.560 --> 34:25.400
dealings with Saddam Hussein.

34:25.400 --> 34:29.120
And evidence he needs to clear himself is stolen by George Sr, effectively throwing

34:29.120 --> 34:31.560
his own son under the bus to save himself.

34:31.560 --> 34:32.920
He's not a great dad.

34:32.920 --> 34:37.780
George Sr's ties to Saddam Hussein, revealing the interest of private business in earning

34:37.780 --> 34:42.320
a profit over national security, is just one of many political observations made throughout

34:42.320 --> 34:43.320
the series.

34:43.320 --> 34:47.680
In the same episode, we see Buster enlist into the army by Lucille when she's confronted

34:47.680 --> 34:51.200
by a legally distinct version of Michael Moore.

34:52.200 --> 35:01.200
Although Lucille would later regret it, it does

35:01.200 --> 35:05.200
underscore the desperation of the US military if they're willing to accept a guy like

35:05.200 --> 35:06.840
Buster into their ranks.

35:06.840 --> 35:11.680
As the next two seasons progress, the political commentary gets increasingly obvious.

35:11.680 --> 35:16.520
The Patriot Act, a controversial piece of post-9-11 legislation that gave the US government

35:16.520 --> 35:20.960
greater surveillance power, is mocked when it's used to obtain a photo of bunkers with

35:20.960 --> 35:27.000
weapons of mass destruction, not realizing that this photo is actually of Tobias' balls.

35:32.760 --> 35:37.120
George Sr is found in a hole similar to the one Saddam Hussein was hiding in, and at one

35:37.120 --> 35:41.440
point he records a video that very much presents him looking like Osama bin Laden.

35:41.440 --> 35:45.680
The beliefs even find themselves in a rock, meeting Saddam Hussein impersonators living

35:45.680 --> 35:51.800
in the Iraqi version of the model home, complete with what appears to be a weapon of mass destruction.

35:51.800 --> 35:56.400
I haven't even mentioned references to the cut and run talking point, the George W. Bush

35:56.400 --> 36:01.560
mission accomplished photo op, the Rumsfeld photo parody, and so many more.

36:01.560 --> 36:05.280
Arrested development was diving into political comedy in a way no other sitcom at the time

36:05.280 --> 36:06.280
was.

36:06.280 --> 36:10.120
Towards the end of the third season, we also learn that George Sr has secretly been working

36:10.120 --> 36:12.360
with the US government this whole time.

36:16.440 --> 36:20.080
Yeah, we got some guy named George Bluth to build houses down there so we could wire them.

36:20.080 --> 36:24.120
The Bluths are portrayed as entrenched in the government establishment, and are also

36:24.120 --> 36:26.040
working with Saddam Hussein.

36:26.040 --> 36:29.640
Although Hussein's reign wasn't welcomed by the United States when it began, his war

36:29.640 --> 36:34.480
with Iran did make him a temporary ally, an uneasy partnership that went south when Iraq

36:34.480 --> 36:36.320
went on to invade Kuwait.

36:36.320 --> 36:40.480
The Bluths represent the capriciousness of these relationships, dependent on economic

36:40.480 --> 36:45.160
ties as oil can be traced to the root of many of these real-world conflicts.

36:45.160 --> 36:48.600
Although Arrested Development was more concerned with showing how incredibly silly all of

36:48.600 --> 36:53.520
this was, it also revealed a cynicism towards American foreign policy that was rarely seen

36:53.520 --> 36:56.160
in the immediate post-9-11 era.

36:56.160 --> 37:00.720
It's a sharp rebuke of the unthinking patriotism that you often saw on TV shows, instead opting

37:00.720 --> 37:05.000
to portray how the American government and big businesses are happy to collude with supposed

37:05.000 --> 37:08.160
enemies if it meant keeping the price of oil down.

37:08.160 --> 37:12.600
Another big part of this series is the increasingly sour relationship between Tobias and Lindsay.

37:12.600 --> 37:17.880
As you may or may not know, Lindsay and I have hit a bit of a rough patch.

37:17.880 --> 37:18.880
Really?

37:18.880 --> 37:19.880
When did that start?

37:19.880 --> 37:23.880
Well, I don't want to blame it all on 9-11, but...

37:23.880 --> 37:28.160
We get a hint of why their marriage is failing in the first episode of this series.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.160
You're gay.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.160
No, no.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.160
No, I'm not.

37:31.160 --> 37:32.160
I'm not gay.

37:32.160 --> 37:35.880
No, Lindsay, how many times must we have this?

37:35.880 --> 37:36.880
No.

37:36.880 --> 37:41.440
Assumptions about Tobias' sexuality come up again many times throughout the series'

37:41.440 --> 38:08.960
run, usually because of his unusual choice of words.

38:08.960 --> 38:14.020
The irony here being that Tobias, as a trained analyst and therapist, isn't able to infer

38:14.020 --> 38:21.680
some deeper meaning behind the unusual way he speaks.

38:21.680 --> 38:26.620
Tobias actively rejecting expectations of his gender leads people to suspect he may

38:26.620 --> 38:31.960
be gay, or the fact that he's a never-nude, which means he can never go anywhere without

38:31.960 --> 38:36.320
wearing a pair of cutoffs, and that he often uses female pronouns when drawing analogies

38:36.320 --> 38:39.400
to himself may even suggest that he's trans.

38:39.400 --> 38:43.520
In her essay on the character, Darcy Dahl, an assistant professor of philosophy at Delta

38:43.520 --> 38:48.840
College, describes how the real lesson here is to not treat Tobias' sexuality or gender

38:48.840 --> 38:53.280
identity as some kind of guessing game, but instead reflect on what that says about the

38:53.280 --> 38:55.760
expectations we place on people.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.760
She writes,

38:56.760 --> 39:00.760
What a person like Tobias shows us is that we needn't conserve ourselves with fitting

39:00.760 --> 39:02.520
into a specific mold.

39:02.520 --> 39:06.720
We need not worry about whether we're too feminine or masculine, nor about whether our

39:06.720 --> 39:10.880
sexuality or personality conforms to normal standards.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.760
Perhaps we should all try to find the Tobias inside of us.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.960
While there are plenty of things in Tobias we can find fault with, such as his neglect

39:17.960 --> 39:22.320
of his daughter, his inability to leave a doomed marriage, or his ridiculous attempts

39:22.320 --> 39:26.620
to try and become an actor, when it comes to his sexuality or gender, he doesn't seem

39:26.620 --> 39:28.280
to be distressed by it.

39:28.280 --> 39:30.880
So how is it anyone else's business?

39:30.880 --> 39:34.960
Even if he does have some kind of deep internal conflicts, instead of telling him what those

39:34.960 --> 39:40.000
are, what he needs is a loving, caring space to explore those feelings himself and find

39:40.000 --> 39:43.560
his own way through them, which again, is something he may not even need.

39:43.560 --> 39:46.880
It's also something he'll never find in the Blue Family.

39:46.880 --> 39:50.480
Lindsay struggles to find a life outside of her marriage with Tobias being asked to leave

39:50.480 --> 39:51.480
the model home.

39:51.480 --> 39:52.480
Like what you see?

39:52.480 --> 39:55.640
I've been looking for those, you're gonna stretch them out.

39:55.640 --> 39:56.640
That's all you can say?

39:56.640 --> 40:00.000
Well, excuse me for liking the way they shaped my junk.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.560
I don't know why, but that's it.

40:02.560 --> 40:05.680
You can pack your junk and get out.

40:05.680 --> 40:11.480
And Tobias has to worm his way back in by posing as a British danny named Mrs. Featherbottom.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.480
Who'd like a banger in the mouth?

40:13.480 --> 40:14.480
Oh, right, I forgot.

40:14.480 --> 40:19.560
Here in the States you call it a sausage in the mouth.

40:19.560 --> 40:20.880
We just call it a sausage.

40:20.880 --> 40:24.980
Although Lindsay assumes Tobias is doing this because he misses maybe, the truth is, either

40:24.980 --> 40:28.860
she nor Tobias are very concerned with the happenings of their daughter.

40:28.860 --> 40:32.940
The Funke family is crumbling because of Tobias' nursing this ridiculous dream about

40:32.940 --> 40:37.300
becoming a doctor, and Lindsay is trying to maintain her life as a philanthropist while

40:37.300 --> 40:41.620
dating outside her marriage, and they're each living off the fumes of the family fortune,

40:41.620 --> 40:43.740
doing nothing to adapt to their new circumstances.

40:43.740 --> 40:47.500
They're so clueless that they're not even sure their marriage is over or not.

40:47.500 --> 40:51.580
Maybe the fact that we don't know if we're together or not is a sign that we should split

40:51.580 --> 40:52.580
again.

40:52.580 --> 40:53.820
Or stay split up.

40:53.820 --> 40:55.580
Okay, forget about Vegas.

40:55.580 --> 40:57.900
We'll stay here and get back together.

40:57.900 --> 41:02.380
This reveals the level of rot that sets in the minds of people living off of fabulous

41:02.380 --> 41:05.980
wealth, particularly when they had nothing to do with its creation.

41:05.980 --> 41:10.120
Tobias and Lindsay have spent much of their adult lives living off their whims, especially

41:10.120 --> 41:12.620
Lindsay's whim to become married to Tobias.

41:12.620 --> 41:17.200
It's a reflection of a life lived without consequences for those whims, and maybe is

41:17.200 --> 41:21.900
left out in the cold, born into a family that barely pays attention to her.

41:21.900 --> 41:26.060
Luckily for her, she manages to connive her way into becoming a teenage movie executive.

41:27.060 --> 41:35.220
These two seasons also saw a number of changes for Buster.

41:35.220 --> 41:38.860
After joining the army, he lost his hand to a dangerous seal attack.

41:38.860 --> 41:48.860
And then a seal bites off his hand.

41:48.860 --> 42:03.100
We also learn that Buster's father may not be George Sr.

42:03.100 --> 42:20.460
A

42:20.460 --> 42:24.620
key part of Buster's story is this bizarre moment where Lucille is confronted.

42:24.620 --> 42:35.340
Oh, this guy always gets me.

42:35.340 --> 42:39.060
Although George Michael's crush on his cousin was firmly established in season one, over

42:39.060 --> 42:44.340
time we see him develop a new interest in Anne Veal.

42:44.340 --> 42:45.340
Michael isn't a fan.

42:45.340 --> 42:49.540
Although much of the series establishes he finds her bland and uninteresting, there is

42:49.540 --> 42:59.100
another side to his lack of an appreciation.

42:59.100 --> 43:03.700
There's something particularly gross about a grown man making jokes about a teenage girl's

43:03.700 --> 43:04.700
weight.

43:04.700 --> 43:08.180
And even though Mae Whitman, for many of her scenes, is wearing a fat suit, or at least

43:08.180 --> 43:13.100
the hips of a fat suit, according to the actress, she just doesn't seem particularly overweight.

43:13.100 --> 43:17.940
It's a strange vocal point for Michael and reveals him to be not quite the nice guy he

43:17.940 --> 43:19.580
tries to present himself as.

43:19.580 --> 43:24.060
It's a subtle reminder that there are no good bluths in the show.

43:24.060 --> 43:29.460
Even while he's romancing Anne, George Michael still has an attraction to his cousin.

43:29.460 --> 43:42.960
When the two of them kiss in the season two finale, the model home literally sinks.

43:42.960 --> 43:46.940
And while this gets awkwardly ignored in season three, we do get some closure for the George

43:46.940 --> 43:48.900
Michael relationship with Anne.

43:48.900 --> 43:54.700
She dumps him.

43:54.700 --> 43:58.980
Third season did show us a relationship blossoming though, and it's perhaps the most controversial

43:58.980 --> 44:03.740
one in the series, Michael's relationship with Rita Leeds, played by Charlize Theron.

44:03.740 --> 44:07.940
Let's just jump right to a fact that the series takes several episodes to reveal.

44:07.940 --> 44:11.980
Rita has a mental health condition that is unfortunately revealed through the use of

44:11.980 --> 44:13.420
an ableist slur.

44:13.420 --> 44:18.360
Michael is unable to notice for several episodes because she's British and incredibly beautiful,

44:18.360 --> 44:20.480
so he assumes she's being quirky.

44:20.480 --> 44:25.060
When he proposes and nearly has sex with her, he only stops after learning the truth.

44:25.060 --> 44:38.560
And then he ends things with Rita.

44:38.560 --> 44:42.400
This half-season arc has gotten some critical attention over the years, though aside from

44:42.400 --> 44:47.140
the use of a certain word and the childlike innocence archetype Rita is slotted into,

44:47.140 --> 44:52.060
the series does make an effort to create a more well-rounded character who has wants

44:52.060 --> 44:53.220
and desires of her own.

44:53.220 --> 44:56.940
It's a level of depth we didn't get to see for other love interests of Michael, such

44:56.940 --> 44:57.940
as Marta.

44:57.940 --> 45:01.720
Although it's worth mentioning that Rita is fabulously wealthy, putting her in a closer

45:01.720 --> 45:05.020
social standing to the Bluths than someone like Marta.

45:05.020 --> 45:07.720
Being white and British I'm sure helps as well.

45:07.720 --> 45:11.280
One thing Arrested Development does that's unlike a lot of other shows is including a

45:11.280 --> 45:15.260
number of characters with disabilities, visible or otherwise.

45:15.260 --> 45:19.820
Even members of the principal cast have disabilities, such as Tobias being a never nude and Buster

45:19.820 --> 45:24.840
losing his hand, while in the case of Buster, laughing at him for losing a hand and treating

45:24.840 --> 45:27.440
him like a machine can seem a bit cruel.

45:27.440 --> 45:30.280
And Tobias being a never nude is just a punchline.

45:30.280 --> 45:34.820
The show's record on characters with disabilities does become more complex when looking at the

45:34.820 --> 45:36.280
supporting cast.

45:36.280 --> 45:38.480
For Slate, Inku Kang wrote,

45:38.480 --> 45:42.700
It's hard to think of another series that features so many different kinds of disabilities

45:42.700 --> 45:47.220
while ensuring that the people with those syndromes are more than their impairments.

45:47.220 --> 45:52.000
In fact, they are, with a single glaring exception, just like the rest of the show's version

45:52.000 --> 45:53.000
of Orange County.

45:53.000 --> 45:58.840
Vain, Vindictive, Pompous, Dishonest, Opportunistic, and or Oblivious.

45:58.840 --> 46:03.100
These characters fit so seamlessly into the rest of the show's universe that they silently

46:03.100 --> 46:08.460
expose how cloying and or exoticizing Hollywood's usual stereotypes about people with disabilities

46:08.460 --> 46:09.460
are.

46:09.460 --> 46:15.900
Inspirational, Asexual, Tragic, Brilliant, or Superpowered, a victim or a villain.

46:15.900 --> 46:18.700
They're impairments poised to be overcome.

46:18.700 --> 46:22.460
One of the major through lines in the series is the impact between generations within a

46:22.460 --> 46:23.460
family.

46:23.460 --> 46:27.740
And this can be seen in one of the key relationships between a father and son.

46:27.740 --> 46:30.460
Michael and his son, George Michael.

46:30.460 --> 46:33.780
Michael is determined to raise his son in a loving way that his father hadn't for

46:33.780 --> 46:34.780
him.

46:34.780 --> 46:39.260
In the second episode, we see how Michael does that when he confers the important responsibility

46:39.260 --> 46:42.740
of running the family banana stand on George Michael.

46:42.740 --> 46:45.380
Don't look at me, Mr. Manager.

46:45.380 --> 46:46.380
It's up to me now.

46:46.380 --> 46:47.380
I'm Mr. Manager.

46:47.380 --> 46:48.380
Manager?

46:48.380 --> 46:49.380
We just say...

46:49.380 --> 46:50.380
I know, but...

46:50.380 --> 46:52.740
It doesn't matter who.

46:52.740 --> 46:57.380
The subtle joke here is that Michael is denying his son the adult Mr. Title, not letting him

46:57.380 --> 46:58.380
grow up.

46:58.380 --> 47:00.620
A key part of the relationship.

47:00.620 --> 47:03.900
The two Bluth boys struggle to communicate with one another.

47:03.900 --> 47:07.900
And while Michael remembers his father being a controlling tyrant, he exercises his own

47:07.900 --> 47:09.580
brand of control over George Michael.

47:09.580 --> 47:11.740
I'll work weeknights, I'll lay people off.

47:11.740 --> 47:13.660
I'll give up my summer, all my summers.

47:13.660 --> 47:15.980
Just tell me what to do, and I'll do it.

47:15.980 --> 47:20.060
Michael realized he had done to his son what his father had done to him.

47:20.060 --> 47:23.180
Michael doesn't want to be like his father, but the way he's raised George Michael is

47:23.180 --> 47:27.820
a lot like the way George Sr. raised him, such as getting them to be incredibly hard

47:27.820 --> 47:28.820
on themselves.

47:28.820 --> 47:29.820
What?

47:29.820 --> 47:30.820
No, you stupid jerk.

47:30.820 --> 47:31.820
Why not?

47:31.820 --> 47:32.820
Dumb.

47:32.820 --> 47:33.820
Dumb.

47:33.860 --> 47:35.200
Dumb, George Michael.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.700
Dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb.

47:36.700 --> 47:38.420
Whoa, calm down, you two.

47:38.420 --> 47:39.580
It's just a math problem.

47:39.580 --> 47:43.480
Yeah, but if I fail math, there goes my chance at a good job and a happy life full of hard

47:43.480 --> 47:44.480
work.

47:44.480 --> 47:45.480
Like you always say.

47:45.480 --> 47:48.500
I know, but it's my fault I've been pushing him too hard.

47:48.500 --> 47:51.020
It's just dumb, dumb, dumb, Michael, dumb.

47:51.020 --> 47:52.020
Shh, shh, I forgive you.

47:52.020 --> 47:55.860
The intergenerational impact of bad parenting is felt throughout the series.

47:55.860 --> 47:59.620
It's this relationship that carries the heart of the series in the early seasons, and would

47:59.620 --> 48:03.340
be one major thing to keep in mind for the fourth season, though that wouldn't be coming

48:03.340 --> 48:04.700
for another eight years.

48:04.700 --> 48:09.180
Fox finally pulled the plug on Arrested Development, with its third season order being cut to a

48:09.180 --> 48:14.580
lean 13 episodes, the final four bearing in opposition to the Winter Olympics.

48:14.580 --> 48:19.420
The series did make several attempts to appeal to a wider audience, though they never quite

48:19.420 --> 48:20.580
resonated.

48:20.580 --> 48:25.380
The second season also used some very heavy-handed product placement to earn some goodwill and

48:25.380 --> 48:36.260
extra ad revenue for the network.

48:36.260 --> 48:41.220
In the third season, after learning the show was being cancelled, a special Save Our Bluths-themed

48:41.220 --> 48:47.100
episode, titled SOBs, parodied every stunt that shows used to goose the ratings, from

48:47.100 --> 49:00.020
guest stars to shots in 3D.

49:00.020 --> 49:10.900
At one point, they even resorted to begging.

49:10.900 --> 49:14.860
When this episode aired, the writing was more or less on the wall, Fox would no longer be

49:14.860 --> 49:18.780
home for Arrested Development, and the show even made coy remarks about the future of

49:18.780 --> 49:31.780
the show.

49:31.780 --> 49:35.460
At one point we see the show contrast its own brand of complex characters with other

49:35.460 --> 50:00.820
TV sitcoms.

50:00.820 --> 50:09.980
It's almost defensive in how firmly the show asserts itself as something transgressive

50:09.980 --> 50:13.560
in the sitcom's space, and at the time, there was some truth to that.

50:13.560 --> 50:17.980
There was an abundance of mediocre sitcoms on the air, using tired yet familiar gags

50:17.980 --> 50:20.180
to attract audiences looking for something comfortable.

50:20.180 --> 50:24.700
But it wasn't as if other genre-dying shows weren't finding success, and blaming the

50:24.700 --> 50:26.820
audience isn't always the best bet.

50:26.820 --> 50:46.300
Michael himself acknowledges this when he says, In the season 3 finale, Development

50:46.300 --> 50:51.620
Arrested, we find the Bluths once again on a boat, much in the way the series began.

50:51.620 --> 50:55.780
George Sr. is free, and we learn Lucille was the real brains behind the Bluth company,

50:55.780 --> 51:05.700
and Lindsay finds out she's adopted.

51:05.700 --> 51:11.060
Sharp-eyed viewers also noticed a subtle reference to the show's strong sales on DVD.

51:11.060 --> 51:15.180
Other bombshells include learning that Anne is dating Job, who then gets punched in the

51:15.180 --> 51:19.940
face by George Michael, and Michael realizes he succeeded in his mission.

51:19.940 --> 51:37.820
When Michael realizes his son is hurting after learning about Job's betrayal, he

51:37.820 --> 51:46.260
wants to comfort him, and he learns something important when Lucille tries to stop him.

51:46.260 --> 51:50.500
It was at that moment that Michael realized how much he'd sold out.

51:50.500 --> 51:55.340
As Michael runs off to be with his son, Lucille sells the company to stand sit-well in a panic,

51:55.340 --> 52:05.580
as An-Yong is revealed to have betrayed the Bluths.

52:05.580 --> 52:20.820
And the show ends on the crucial relationship.

52:20.820 --> 52:34.260
And the epilogue gives us one last gasp of hope.

52:35.580 --> 52:39.940
And so ends the first three seasons of Arrested Development, hitting the important beats of

52:39.940 --> 52:44.140
how families and businesses should be kept distinct, the sinister relationship between

52:44.140 --> 52:47.780
the American government and the business world, and that wealth can rot the connections within

52:47.780 --> 52:48.780
a family.

52:48.780 --> 52:52.100
But it's hard to focus on the themes of the show with all the loud raging over its

52:52.100 --> 52:54.020
untimely cancellation.

52:54.020 --> 52:58.140
Although there were brief flashes of self-awareness, such as the few words from Michael in the

52:58.140 --> 53:03.220
SOB episode, most of the time this was a show that was clearly kicking and screaming as

53:03.220 --> 53:04.500
it went off the air.

53:04.500 --> 53:07.540
Not that it didn't have some ground for that, but it does complicate a reading of

53:07.540 --> 53:08.540
it.

53:08.540 --> 53:12.060
The text becomes less about the characters and their antics and more about the context

53:12.060 --> 53:13.500
the show found itself in.

53:13.500 --> 53:17.220
While the curtain was coming down on the show for now, with some of its lowest ratings thanks

53:17.220 --> 53:25.380
to the love of critics and a passionate fanbase, it wouldn't be quickly forgotten.

53:25.380 --> 53:29.260
Upon entering its second season, ratings for Arrested Development weren't really helped

53:29.260 --> 53:30.460
by its Emmy wins.

53:30.460 --> 53:34.260
It didn't do any worse, but it didn't do a whole lot better either.

53:34.260 --> 53:39.900
The second season averaged 5.9 million viewers per episode, only slightly down from Season

53:39.900 --> 53:42.100
1's 6.2 million.

53:42.100 --> 53:46.580
Although ratings remained low, the show surprisingly got picked up for a third season in an Entertainment

53:46.580 --> 53:47.780
Weekly article.

53:47.780 --> 53:52.820
Peter Leguri, the new Fox Broadcasting President of Entertainment, said in a statement,

53:52.820 --> 53:56.020
Arrested Development is one of the best comedies on television.

53:56.020 --> 53:59.940
The decision to order another season becomes easy when you consider its amazing cast, creative

53:59.940 --> 54:02.580
brilliance, critical acclaim, and advertiser appeal.

54:02.580 --> 54:07.380
It's my first official pick-up since taking the job and I think it's a great way to start.

54:07.380 --> 54:12.940
One change was the show being moved from Sunday nights at 9.30 to Monday nights at 8.

54:12.940 --> 54:14.780
It fared even worse than the ratings.

54:14.780 --> 54:19.460
The third season would go on to average 3.9 million viewers, losing 2 million from the

54:19.460 --> 54:24.700
previous season, albeit that does include four episodes that were aired directly against

54:24.700 --> 54:27.100
the Olympics, dragging down the overall average.

54:27.100 --> 54:31.020
The low ratings hurt morale on the show, and that was likely made worse when the full season

54:31.020 --> 54:34.260
was cut down to a 13-episode half-season.

54:34.260 --> 54:37.820
Although Mitch Hurwitz was in talks to bring the series to showtime for a fourth season,

54:37.820 --> 54:40.220
ultimately these negotiations fell through.

54:40.220 --> 54:44.100
Part of the reason, as Hurwitz would later explain, was because of his own fatigue running

54:44.100 --> 54:45.940
such a detailed series.

54:45.940 --> 54:47.780
In an interview, he said,

54:47.780 --> 54:50.780
In truth, I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series.

54:50.780 --> 54:54.620
I told the story I wanted to tell, and we were getting to a point where I think a lot

54:54.620 --> 54:56.640
of the actors were ready to move on.

54:56.640 --> 55:00.140
My first instinct was that it was over when Fox pulled the plug.

55:00.140 --> 55:04.920
I considered continuing the show because I felt I owed that to the fans, but I am determined

55:04.920 --> 55:09.880
to give them some other kind of entertainment that will satisfy them at some point, I hope.

55:09.880 --> 55:13.940
Even though Arrested Development had a record low viewership, the main demographic appears

55:13.940 --> 55:19.020
to have been movie studio executives, so hopefully the cast will be able to benefit from that.

55:19.020 --> 55:22.540
Even if the show had been picked up for a fourth season, Hurwitz expressed that he likely

55:22.540 --> 55:26.860
would have taken a backseat role, unable to keep up the pace of running a show that was

55:26.860 --> 55:28.940
built on so many small details.

55:28.940 --> 55:32.720
The third season in particular seems to have really demotivated him and everyone working

55:32.720 --> 55:38.080
on the show because of a lack of faith in how it was presented and promoted by the network.

55:38.080 --> 55:41.480
Although the audience for Arrested Development was small, they were particularly passionate,

55:41.480 --> 55:45.280
and when it came time to point fingers, many of them were directed at Fox.

55:45.280 --> 55:47.560
This wasn't entirely spontaneous, though.

55:47.560 --> 55:52.120
In the same way the instant classic label was encouraged by the DVD release of the first

55:52.120 --> 55:56.320
season, the second season's DVD set had a message of its own buried at the end of the

55:56.320 --> 55:58.660
season 2 blooper reel featurette.

55:58.660 --> 56:02.620
I got an idea for what you can do, why don't you f***ing fire your complete marketing team

56:02.620 --> 56:06.780
or get a new one in there, notice how to market a show that won five motherf***ing Emmys,

56:06.780 --> 56:12.900
Golden Globes, SAG Awards, WGA Awards, DGA Awards, Producers Guilds Awards, Critics Top

56:12.900 --> 56:13.900
Ten lists.

56:13.900 --> 56:18.940
You know, if you can't market that kind of show and get better ratings, then maybe the

56:18.940 --> 56:21.060
problem doesn't lie here.

56:21.060 --> 56:22.700
Maybe it lies with marketing.

56:22.700 --> 56:24.180
Good night.

56:24.180 --> 56:26.740
Good night, thank you very much.

56:26.740 --> 56:30.500
David Cross's frustration at the network was a pivotal moment, and really shaped the

56:30.500 --> 56:32.540
perception of why the show failed.

56:32.540 --> 56:36.660
It was moved to different time slots, it wasn't advertised the right way, or the network simply

56:36.660 --> 56:37.980
didn't believe in it.

56:37.980 --> 56:40.540
Looking at the evidence, not all of that is true.

56:40.540 --> 56:44.200
The show had a very stable time slot, aside from that one episode in the first season

56:44.200 --> 56:48.220
that was placed after an episode of American Idol, and the final four episodes being programmed

56:48.220 --> 56:51.780
against the Olympics, which was decided well after the show had been cancelled.

56:51.780 --> 56:55.580
It often didn't air new episodes on consecutive weeks, but the same was true for other shows

56:55.580 --> 56:58.020
on the same night, which tended to perform better.

56:58.020 --> 57:01.140
To say the network simply didn't believe in the show is a bit of a stretch when it

57:01.140 --> 57:04.780
ran for two and a half seasons, with ratings that would get most other shows cancelled

57:04.780 --> 57:07.180
in less than half that amount of time.

57:07.180 --> 57:09.460
None of that is to say the network is blameless, though.

57:09.460 --> 57:14.060
Arrested Development is a hard show to sell, but Fox was unable to capitalize on its acclaim

57:14.060 --> 57:16.340
and loyal fanbase to reach a wider audience.

57:16.340 --> 57:20.340
A brilliant show doesn't naturally find an audience if a network isn't entirely sure

57:20.340 --> 57:22.500
how to find that audience.

57:22.500 --> 57:26.620
In 2011, Mitch Hurwitz wrote an article for The Guardian titled, Arrested Development

57:26.620 --> 57:29.980
creator Mitch Hurwitz's guide to getting a sitcom cancelled.

57:29.980 --> 57:34.300
In it, he has some unflinching reflections on why the show failed to connect to audiences.

57:34.300 --> 57:35.660
Here are a few examples.

57:35.660 --> 57:38.540
Try to do too much for a 20-minute program.

57:38.540 --> 57:42.700
If in your particular medium an audience is used to a simple plot line or maybe one or

57:42.700 --> 57:47.940
two stories, see if you can get aid in there, and find a way that they somehow intertwine.

57:47.940 --> 57:49.100
Add a sprinkle of incest.

57:49.300 --> 57:51.380
They'll never admit it, but viewers love sex.

57:51.380 --> 57:55.140
In fact, they love any sort of titillation, with the exception of incest.

57:55.140 --> 57:56.660
So focus on that.

57:56.660 --> 57:59.840
First impressions are everything, so if you can screw that up, you're made.

57:59.840 --> 58:03.900
With Arrested Development, we tried showing the deep disdain that connects a family.

58:03.900 --> 58:08.340
We wanted to hold up a mirror to American society, and just as predicted, America looked

58:08.340 --> 58:09.340
away.

58:09.340 --> 58:11.260
Make easy jokes about minority groups.

58:11.260 --> 58:16.860
Whether they be Mexicans, Jews, or homosexuals, any group can be dismissed with a few stereotypical

58:16.860 --> 58:17.860
cracks.

58:17.860 --> 58:19.140
That's what we tried to do.

58:19.140 --> 58:23.420
And given their lack of coming to the party, it seems we succeeded.

58:23.420 --> 58:28.060
That last word in particular is worth considering, as there is a distinction to think about when

58:28.060 --> 58:30.300
it comes to edgy humor.

58:30.300 --> 58:35.140
While Arrested Development did have a few tasteless jokes about certain identity groups,

58:35.140 --> 58:39.740
sometimes being outright racist, it typically had even more jokes about the oblivious bluths

58:39.740 --> 58:41.820
and their racist attitudes.

58:41.820 --> 58:45.580
In many cases, the bluths were the butt of the racially charged jokes.

58:45.580 --> 58:50.460
For example, when Job brings out his racist puppet Franklin, the joke here is that Job

58:50.460 --> 59:00.500
is a racist.

59:00.500 --> 59:12.420
The episode even makes a decent bit of racial commentary.

59:12.420 --> 59:15.620
So maybe not all the racial humor on the show was offensive.

59:15.620 --> 59:20.040
But a question worth asking is, even if something isn't offensive, is it something someone

59:20.040 --> 59:22.900
from one of these groups would actually want to watch?

59:22.900 --> 59:26.620
Perhaps more than the racism, rather, it's that a show centered around a rich white family

59:26.620 --> 59:30.900
gets less interesting the further the audience gets away from that experience.

59:30.900 --> 59:34.860
There are plenty of examples of shows ahead of their time that had weak first seasons,

59:34.860 --> 59:36.500
only to catch on some time later.

59:36.500 --> 59:39.860
Cheers was one of the lowest rated shows on network TV when it aired.

59:39.860 --> 59:43.840
Seinfeld went from a solid performer to one of the highest rated shows on television.

59:43.840 --> 59:48.700
But those were shows that began in the 80s, and Arrested Development began in 2003.

59:48.700 --> 59:52.740
The realities of network television were changing, with more channels to compete against and

59:52.740 --> 59:54.580
more people DVR-ing shows.

59:54.580 --> 59:59.320
It was tougher for a niche show to get a chance to grow, because audiences were fragmenting.

59:59.320 --> 01:00:03.740
There was one unique advantage Arrested Development had been in the mid-2000, and that's the

01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.780
benefit of DVD sales.

01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:09.580
Although it's tough to find hard numbers, sales for Arrested Development DVDs were

01:00:09.580 --> 01:00:14.420
quoted as being somewhere around 3 million units sold in the United States in an article

01:00:14.420 --> 01:00:16.500
that was published in 2013.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:20.660
The Numbers, a website that estimates the sales of media, claims that the third season

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:26.220
of Arrested Development sold roughly 400,000 units in its first three weeks, with an audience

01:00:26.220 --> 01:00:30.860
of under 4 million, that's a very high conversion rate of people buying DVDs.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:36.740
While these numbers would be dwarfed by powerhouses in the TV-DVD space, such as Family Guy,

01:00:36.740 --> 01:00:41.100
it was still a sign that, at the very least, Arrested Development had a dedicated enough

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:49.020
fan base not to let the show vanish into the night.

01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:53.180
In the years between Arrested Development's cancellation and return, the series was kept

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:57.900
alive in the minds of the public with rumors of a supposed movie being in the works.

01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:02.220
The cast and creative team would, on occasion, stoke those rumors, but a lot of it was driven

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:05.420
by a fan base hungry for more Arrested Development.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.660
Writing for The Verge, Keith Phipps offers some insight into this time.

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:11.340
Here's some inside baseball.

01:01:11.340 --> 01:01:16.940
If you worked at a pop culture website between 2006 and 2013, running items about Arrested

01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.860
Development's long-rumored return was like printing page views.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.340
In addition to having a voracious fan base, Arrested Development was also fortunate to

01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:29.740
have critics in position of influence to ensure that the series was held in high regard,

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:33.740
frequently placing it on lists of the all-time greatest TV shows.

01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:38.220
This period is what started to cement the idea of Arrested Development being canonized

01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:40.300
as one of the all-time TV greats.

01:01:40.300 --> 01:01:45.020
It was unique, daring, and canceled before its time, everything to make it a darling,

01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:48.940
and its reputation was helping it find a wider audience even off the air.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:53.260
In TV history, shows that are considered all-time classics are often those that drew a massive

01:01:53.260 --> 01:01:57.180
audience, but a space has always been carved out for smaller shows that were canceled before

01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.900
their time, usually because they were very influential.

01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:03.660
That space is reserved for shows that are not remembered by a mass audience, but rather

01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:06.860
critics or a passionate fan base that keep it from being forgotten.

01:02:06.860 --> 01:02:10.140
Historically, this is closer to how other forms of art are remembered.

01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:14.700
Although popularity is a helpful boost, a mass audience tends to move on from a work

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:19.020
of art as time goes on, so it falls to critics, academics, and the most passionate

01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.820
appreciators of a field of art to preserve its memory.

01:02:21.820 --> 01:02:24.380
With television, things become more complicated.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.380
It's rare for any long-running TV series to have its best episodes or moments in the

01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:29.500
first season or two.

01:02:29.500 --> 01:02:33.820
Oftentimes, shows will find that their third, fourth, or fifth seasons are among their

01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:38.300
strongest, but it could only get there if it could build on a base of popular support.

01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:43.020
This is why popularity is always important to consider when thinking of the all-time

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.140
TV greats.

01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:48.380
A movie, a song, or a book is a finished product and is going to reach the highest

01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:52.540
potential it can, but a show that keeps running has room to grow and improve.

01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:55.740
This makes Arrested Development's accomplishment of becoming considered a

01:02:55.740 --> 01:02:57.820
classic so quickly even more impressive.

01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:00.140
Throughout the years following the cancellation of the show,

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:04.940
fansites started popping up online, including the Balboa Observer, the Inconvenient

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.180
Bluth, and the Banana Stand.

01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:10.860
Fansites in particular were a fitting homage, as the show itself was constantly

01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:14.540
putting together mock websites that were briefly mentioned on an episode.

01:03:14.540 --> 01:03:18.700
The series itself almost seems built for internet fandom, as part of the fun involved

01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:22.460
diving into each episode, finding foreshadowing for future events.

01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.900
Like a vague reference to a dangerous seal attacking people several episodes

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.740
before it would bite off Buster's hand.

01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:36.380
Or a guy who bears a striking resemblance to one of Saddam Hussein's sons appearing

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.500
at a Bluth Company event.

01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:40.700
Is that Kusei Hussein at the omelet bar?

01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:45.500
All these little details became catnip for a fanbase that was all too happy to dissect them.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:50.380
In many ways, this has even influenced how other fandoms have deconstructed shows on the internet,

01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:55.500
hyperfixating on every detail in a trailer or an episode, trying to connect various narrative

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:59.820
strands. While Arrested Development fans certainly didn't invent this way of looking at media,

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:02.140
they did help popularize it on the internet.

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:06.780
There is a downside to this though. It's helped give us an online culture that is less inclined

01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:11.980
to discuss the themes or experiences of watching something to instead try and find any small

01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:15.500
detail that appears more than once and calling it a day.

01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:20.860
While no specific way of watching a TV show is correct or better than the other, I personally

01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:25.260
appreciate a more balanced approach. It's fun to find easter eggs, but I think it's fun to do

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:29.900
something with those eggs to shape one's understanding of what a show is trying to say.

01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.580
The series even inspired fans to create a documentary that included interviews with

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:36.620
cast members and other people involved with the production of the series.

01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:41.020
It also interviewed a number of fans, all expressing their undying love for the series.

01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:45.180
After what seemed like an endless series of teases, eventually it was revealed that Arrested

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:51.820
Development was coming back from the land of dead TV shows. It was what fans thought was a dream come

01:04:51.820 --> 01:05:00.300
true. On October 2nd, 2011, the cast of Arrested Development, along with Ron Howard and Mitch

01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:04.700
Hurwitz, all gathered for a reunion at the New Yorker Festival. It was here we got the first

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:08.060
real indicator that the show would be returning for a limited run.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.940
About six weeks later, it was announced that Netflix would be the new home for this new run

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:33.820
of episodes, convinced in part by the show's strong streaming and DVD performance. Rather

01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:37.980
than renewing the life of the series and continuing to produce new seasons, this was

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:43.100
intended to be a standalone season. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings described it saying,

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:48.460
Arrested Development is a wildly successful tactic, as opposed to fundamental to the strategy.

01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:53.980
In August of 2012, a rough date was given for the series' return, spring of 2013.

01:05:53.980 --> 01:05:58.140
One of the major challenges for the fourth season was that, thanks in no small part to

01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:03.500
the critical success of the original three seasons, the cast had become very hot commodities, so

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:08.300
working out the time to film ten episodes of a fourth season was a real challenge.

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:12.780
Hurwitz decided that, instead of trying to recreate the ensemble dynamic of the earlier

01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:17.660
seasons, he would instead use these episodes to focus on the individual characters, making it

01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:22.620
easier to film around the schedules of the actors. In fact, this project wasn't even originally

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:28.140
intended to be a self-contained fourth season. Rather, the idea was for a series of shorts that

01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:32.460
would lead to an eventual movie. Hype for the series eventually turned this into a full-blown

01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:37.420
season, but the movie was always going to be part of the plan. In an interview, Hurwitz said,

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:41.820
The master plan is to do these episodes and then do the movie, where the family is all together,

01:06:41.820 --> 01:06:46.140
and it's very much written and directed in that direction. It all leads to a bigger story.

01:06:46.140 --> 01:06:50.780
It's kind of the preamble, although hopefully it'll be satisfying in its own right.

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:55.420
The fourth season was really more of an act one that would hopefully lead into a movie with acts

01:06:55.420 --> 01:07:00.300
two and three. Although originally planned to be ten episodes, with Jason Bateman appearing in all

01:07:00.300 --> 01:07:05.100
of them and the rest of the cast being featured in one episode each, the series kept getting larger

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:09.740
in the planning stages. Eventually it would grow to fifteen episodes. Episodes would still feature

01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:13.980
a character from the Blue Family, only some characters got two episodes and others only

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:19.660
won. Hurwitz was pushed to his limits organizing the series. David Cross in an interview describes

01:07:19.660 --> 01:07:23.900
what it was like visiting Hurwitz's office. You know the murder scene where they go to the

01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:28.540
psycho killer's apartment and he's got all this crazy sh** mapped out? That's what it looked like.

01:07:28.540 --> 01:07:33.580
Post-it notes and index cards all across the three walls into this big conference room,

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.140
yarn stretching from one thing to another and pinned in one place, and then a sharp angular

01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:43.500
uptick to the Lucille character and down. And then there's a different colored yarn that intersects

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:48.140
and weaves in. It took Hurwitz 25 minutes to explain what I was looking at and I still didn't

01:07:48.140 --> 01:07:53.100
get everything. When you see that, of course it has to be a TV show. There's no way else to do this.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:58.700
Episodes weren't filmed separately. Rather, multiple scenes were shot each day regardless

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:03.020
of the episode they were in. Scripts were rewritten or sometimes only half finished,

01:08:03.020 --> 01:08:07.660
so many lines were written on the set. In an interview, director Troy Miller said,

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:11.260
There's never been a half hour comedy with a level of complexity here. The idea of how

01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:17.260
characters interrelate and the episodic arcs in A, B, C, D and E stories, it's this crazy wormhole

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:22.860
he's created. Portia de Rossi describes her experience filming saying, Look, I had a meltdown

01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:29.020
absolutely. Then she laughs. I think all of us as actors had a moment where things came kind of

01:08:29.020 --> 01:08:34.060
unglued for a second. At one point I remember I had all the episodes on the floor of my trailer

01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:39.340
and they were all open to pages and I kind of went beautiful mind crazy trying to map everything out.

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:45.020
I had arrows and diagrams and it was so crazy and then I thought, Oh, I just have to let go

01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:51.740
completely and show up to set and be present. As its May 26, 2013 premiere date approached,

01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:56.380
it was clear that the season wasn't meant to be consumed the way the previous three had been.

01:08:56.380 --> 01:09:01.580
It was meant to be watched repeatedly with jokes revealing themselves on rewatches and plot lines

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.660
intersecting in ways people weren't noticing the first time around. Ahead of the release,

01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:11.260
Mitch Hurwitz offered some advice on watching the season. You can't take it all in at once.

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:16.060
It's like the selective attention test. It gives fans something to pour over if that's fun for them.

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:20.540
If they want to go right back and check out the Job episode and see how that was set up,

01:09:20.540 --> 01:09:25.260
they can. Months ahead of the premiere, Netflix started a unique marketing campaign.

01:09:25.260 --> 01:09:29.820
They began placing fake shows and movies on their platform inspired by previous episodes

01:09:29.820 --> 01:09:34.620
of Arrested Development. There was also a contest for five fans with the most impressive creations

01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:39.180
getting a chance to appear in a scene on the show. We also got a fun demo reel for Tobias

01:09:39.180 --> 01:09:50.060
on his website, insertmeanywhere.biz. Netflix even held an orange carpet premiere

01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:53.740
to celebrate the release, screening the first two episodes of the season.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:58.380
Leading up to the release, there were a number of times and interviews that Mitch Hurwitz was

01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:03.020
asked if he had any misgivings about the series potentially tarnishing the legacy of the original

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:07.260
three seasons he had created. At this point, Arrested Development had more or less been

01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:12.300
branded an all-time classic. Hurwitz was always quick to reassure people that this season would

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:17.340
not disappoint, and one quote in particular makes it quite clear how the profile had not only grown

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:22.140
in the minds of the audience, but also in the mind of the show's creator, Hurwitz said.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:25.820
If the first series aspired to be the godfather in terms of the family,

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:30.620
this thing aspires to be a godfather too. I'm sure a lot of people went to see the godfather

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:35.740
part two and said, what happens to the machine guns? What are we doing in Cuba? Meetings? Who

01:10:35.740 --> 01:10:40.620
cares about meetings? But the godfather too was more substantial and rewatchable. It was more

01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:45.260
complex. I aspire to do that kind of evolution with this. I don't mean to compare it to the

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:49.900
godfather 2, I just mean that, well, it's not exactly what the audience expects, but I think

01:10:49.900 --> 01:10:54.940
it'll scratch the itch. Any comparison to the godfather, even one that was walked back,

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:59.660
can come across as a bit of a boast, but at the time, it seemed defensible.

01:10:59.660 --> 01:11:03.340
Season 4 had some very heavy expectations on its shoulders.

01:11:08.620 --> 01:11:13.020
Fourth season of Arrested Development is so densely layered that even writing about it is

01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:17.900
a challenge. The first three seasons of the show had smaller story arcs that usually only ran for

01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:22.380
about half a season, and the only long-term stories were either directly tied to the constant

01:11:22.380 --> 01:11:28.220
perils of the Bluth Company or ongoing personal concerns like Tobias trying to find an acting job.

01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:32.700
In other words, they were just reiterating the situation of this situation comedy.

01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:37.180
Season 4 took things to a much grander scale, with the show's premise changing from a family

01:11:37.180 --> 01:11:41.660
being held together to one that had been split apart. Each character had their own distinct

01:11:41.660 --> 01:11:46.140
narrative, only occasionally intersecting with the other characters, and even though the episode

01:11:46.140 --> 01:11:52.860
count was 15, the actual episodes ran considerably longer, ranging from 29 to 38 minutes. Its total

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:58.460
runtime is slightly longer than season 1's, even though that one ran for an additional 7 episodes.

01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:04.300
Season 4 opens with a tease of where this story will take us, to a night called Cinco de Quatro,

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:09.660
originally created by the Bluths to undermine the Hispanic festival Cinco de Mayo, only to have

01:12:09.660 --> 01:12:14.940
Cinco de Quatro claimed by that same community. And it's the sight of the murder of Lucille

01:12:14.940 --> 01:12:20.140
Austero. To unravel how this all happened, the series goes back several years, picking up

01:12:20.140 --> 01:12:24.540
immediately where season 3 left off, with the Bluths recovering at a Coast Guard headquarters

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:29.980
after having been rescued from sea when Lucille, fleeing the authorities, took the boat that most

01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:35.340
of the family was on off course. Michael, having discovered at the end of season 3 that George

01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:40.060
Sr. had stowed away on the boat he and George Michael were escaping on, also heads back to be

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:45.100
reunited with the family. The scene in the Coast Guard headquarters is one of the few that featured

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.900
all of the Bluth family in the same place at the same time, and it serves as a staging ground for

01:12:49.900 --> 01:12:54.220
the stories to come. This scene is revisited multiple times throughout the season. Here's

01:12:54.220 --> 01:13:11.660
how one moment is portrayed across several episodes. From this scene, each of the characters

01:13:11.660 --> 01:13:16.700
goes off on their own adventures, rather than try to follow all the twists and turns of each of them,

01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:21.500
and there are a lot. Instead, let's look at what it means for this family to fall apart.

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.740
One pattern among every member of the family is that their lives all start to break down

01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:30.460
when they're separated, with no Michael or Bluth company holding them together. All the characters

01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:34.940
almost immediately begin to self-destruct, even Michael's new development company quickly fails

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:40.140
and he's stuck living in George Michael's dorm until he's pathetically voted out. With his son

01:13:40.140 --> 01:13:44.780
as the sole exception, Michael believes he'll be able to find a happier life for himself without

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:50.380
his family, and the other Bluths all believe the same thing. Tobias' story has him busking on the

01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:54.940
street dressed up as The Thing from The Fantastic Four. This leads him to getting registered as a

01:13:54.940 --> 01:14:10.940
sex offender when he pays a visit to Maybe. In Tobias' story, there's a genuinely sweet

01:14:10.940 --> 01:14:16.620
moment between him and his new friend, Debris Bardot, played by Maria Bamford, a former actress

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:33.820
who is now in treatment for a chemical addiction. As the only outsider in the Bluth family,

01:14:33.820 --> 01:14:38.060
Tobias is starving for positive support, the sort you might expect from a family,

01:14:38.060 --> 01:14:42.700
but not if that family is the Bluths. It's a reminder of how non-typical this family is,

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:47.660
and Tobias being a part of it for over 20 years has borne the brunt of that reality.

01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:51.980
Tobias spends much of his story assembling a new family, ostensibly to put on a production of a

01:14:51.980 --> 01:14:57.420
Fantastic Four musical, but in reality he really loves being surrounded by a positive, caring group

01:14:57.420 --> 01:15:02.700
of people who are willing to indulge his dream of becoming an actor. It still doesn't end well,

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:07.340
because Tobias is terrible at acting, but in spite of his loss of fortunes, he seems happier

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:11.820
struggling to get by with Debris than he ever did with Lindsay, who never appreciated his better

01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:15.900
qualities. Lindsay's plotline is perhaps the most political the show has gotten up to this

01:15:15.900 --> 01:15:22.780
point. She leaves Tobias for a young activist named Marky Bark, played by Chris Diamantopoulos.

01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:28.700
Although things are nice at first, she eventually realizes that a life of a simple ostrich farmer

01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:34.780
isn't for her. She eventually drops Marky to be with Herbert Love, played by Terry Crews. Perhaps

01:15:34.780 --> 01:15:39.900
dating the show, Herbert is a reference to Herman Cain, who is running for the Republican nomination

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:44.860
in 2012, before dropping out after he was accused of sexually harassing multiple women.

01:15:44.860 --> 01:15:49.340
Lindsay, charmed by his wealth, doesn't realize Herbert Love has hired her as an escort,

01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:53.420
with payment going to maybe as her pimp. It would take too long to explain how that happens,

01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:57.980
so let's keep moving. Jumping ahead to the conclusion, eventually Lindsay leaves Herbert,

01:15:57.980 --> 01:16:02.220
only to end up replacing him on the campaign trail. After being robbed by someone she

01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:06.300
thought was a Mexican man, Lindsay gives a speech that will sound very familiar.

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:22.060
This episode aired over two years before Donald Trump would announce his bid to become the

01:16:22.060 --> 01:16:26.220
president, though the wall on the southern border had long been a talking point in right-wing

01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:32.140
politics. Ironically, Lindsay was in some ways meant to model Hillary Clinton, as seen by the

01:16:32.140 --> 01:16:37.660
distinct hairstyle she sports at the close of one episode. This storyline about building a wall on

01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:41.020
the southern border ran through a number of characters' plotlines, but the connection

01:16:41.020 --> 01:16:46.380
to Lindsay was particularly interesting as it spoke to the potential popularity of reactionary

01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:52.220
politics. As parody, it seemed fitting, but in our current reality, it comes across as prophetic.

01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:57.340
One thing season four simply can't escape is how utterly confusing it is. Although it somehow makes

01:16:57.340 --> 01:17:01.500
sense when finished, the experience going through each episode can be frustrating,

01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:07.180
particularly if it's your first time. Plot twists often get no explanation, jokes aren't paid off,

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:12.220
and it's easy to miss familiar faces that would take several episodes to reappear. It also didn't

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:17.100
help that each episode had such a lengthy runtime that even watching a single episode felt more

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:21.820
taxing than perhaps it should have. In an effort to explain the plot, episodes are packed with

01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:26.940
flashbacks, flash-forwards, and heavy narration. Narration that gets disorienting when Ron Howard

01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:32.060
himself shows up for a subplot involving Michael trying to sell his family's story to imagine

01:17:32.060 --> 01:17:37.100
entertainment, only for Michael to imperil the deal when he mistakenly assumes his new girlfriend,

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:42.860
Rebel, played by Isla Fisher, is Ron Howard's mistress. The truth comes out in one of Tobias'

01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:52.300
episodes. Did you not know that I'm Rebel's dad? I thought that you might also be her

01:17:52.300 --> 01:18:02.460
a lover? I get it. I was arrested as a sex offender, but at least I knew it was my daughter

01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:08.620
I was arrested for coming on too. The other guy Rebel is dating is George Maharis. Who was that?

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:16.940
No one. George Michael, looking for a new identity, is going by George Maharis now,

01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:21.420
and Rebel was impressed by his software company that would hide your online footprint.

01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:26.860
Fakeblock, which doesn't exist. At least not as a software company, it's actually just an app

01:18:26.860 --> 01:18:31.500
that's a fake woodblock. I hope you can see how confusing this is all getting. The season's

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:35.820
fixation on individual characters does have some strength though. The plot lines dive deep into

01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:40.060
who these characters are, and these include moments of realization for these characters,

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:44.620
occasionally summed up by other characters. You know, your whole life is an escape act,

01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:49.580
and this girl seems like she really likes you. Why don't you just try to work it out and just stop

01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:57.020
running? What you are is the invisible girl. You'll make it impossible for people to see

01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:03.580
you in order to protect yourself. And that's when maybe who had spent so long lying to others,

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:09.900
and even herself, finally had to admit she had made a huge mis- I know I'm fine. Well,

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.140
not everyone has a moment of realization. There was also an intriguing plot line involving a

01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:18.460
private investigator really emphasizing how the family was dissolving. Where the hell am I going

01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:27.420
to find a PI? Jean Parmesan. At your service. AHH! Jean! He does this to me every time!

01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:31.660
This guy gets me every time. The season does have a unique ending compared to every other

01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:36.620
season of Arrested Development though. Michael, through some sly maneuvering, tries to get George

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:41.180
Michael out of Rebel's life without George Michael finding out they're dating the same woman.

01:19:41.180 --> 01:19:46.060
And when the truth comes out, instead of closing with father and son somehow taking off from the

01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:58.460
family once again as seen in previous seasons, this happens instead. And that's how the season

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:04.060
ends. With George Michael finally standing up to his father and, we hope, possibly breaking the

01:20:04.060 --> 01:20:10.380
Bluth family cycle. By lying to his son and being even more like his father than he had been before,

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:14.780
Michael was setting up George Michael to be the same put-upon son that Michael was.

01:20:14.780 --> 01:20:19.260
George Michael punching his father in the face is him rejecting that role for himself.

01:20:19.260 --> 01:20:23.260
There are a few post-credits scenes with Buster being arrested for murdering Lucille too,

01:20:23.260 --> 01:20:27.740
and Rod Howard excitedly talking about a movie based on him, but it would be some time before

01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:31.660
those particular threads would be followed up on. The season ended as one of the most

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:37.420
densely structured seasons of a sitcom I have ever seen. Storylines layered on top of one another,

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:42.300
intersecting almost randomly, and a single joke could happen simultaneously across multiple

01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:47.500
episodes. It was ambitious, uneven, and deeply polarizing. Even though Arrested Development

01:20:47.500 --> 01:20:52.060
had returned, its fourth season wasn't the universal triumph the hype was demanding.

01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:59.340
Netflix doesn't publish its viewing numbers, so we can't know for certain how well this season

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:05.500
performed. A third party that measured numbers at the time reported that 36% of devices connected

01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:10.780
to Netflix on the Sunday premiere watched at least part of one episode of the series.

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:14.220
That's three times the number of people who watched House of Cards, which was one of the

01:21:14.220 --> 01:21:19.580
strongest Netflix originals at the time. A few months after the show premiered, Netflix's chief

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:24.940
content officer, Ted Sarandos, apparently pleased with the show's performance, said that Arrested

01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:29.420
Development would be returning to the streaming service at some point in the future. They just

01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:34.220
weren't sure when or what form it would take. Mitch Hurwitz also discussed plans he had for

01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:39.100
the series on Netflix, possibly airing material that had been filmed but not used in the fourth

01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:44.700
season. He also described some kind of long-term plot for Tracy Bluth, Michael's deceased wife,

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:50.620
who very briefly appeared in season four on an old tape. She also looks like Isla Fisher, which

01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:56.060
makes the whole relationship Rebel had with Michael and George Michael extra creepy. When

01:21:56.060 --> 01:22:00.380
discussing the end of the season with George Michael punching his father, Hurwitz said in

01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:05.100
an interview, What is the next step if you were to have that kind of situation with your father,

01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:10.940
the closest person to you? What does happen next? As it turns out, I do have answers to that,

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:15.740
but I just need someone to let me make them. The original plan of doing a movie next was

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:21.100
still very much in Hurwitz's mind, though unlike the period after season three ended,

01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:26.380
he said that there would be less teasing until plans were firmly in place and he had some idea

01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:31.180
of a release date. Not all the reactions to the fourth season were quite so optimistic for the

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:35.900
future, though. In contrast to the overwhelmingly positive response of the original, the fourth

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:41.100
season proved to be more polarizing. Some felt it was too much of a departure from the original,

01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:45.660
others appreciated its novel approach to storytelling. Regardless, the fact remains

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:50.700
that it was a divisive season. After season four aired, Mitch Hurwitz posted a handwritten note

01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:55.580
to the show's Facebook page. It read in part, We are also grateful for another chance to bring

01:22:55.580 --> 01:23:00.860
these characters to life and could not have done so without your consistent effort to

01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:06.700
spread the word about it. Although obviously in the case of the enemies, the words you spread were

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.820
don't watch this show. You know, I probably shouldn't have even included them in the

01:23:09.820 --> 01:23:14.780
salutation, but I'm writing this in ink plus making all sorts of mistakes. Did you notice the

01:23:14.780 --> 01:23:19.340
S at the end of the word done? While it's obviously a bit tongue-in-cheek, it's clear

01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:23.820
that Hurwitz was hearing a round of criticism about the fourth season, unlike the first three

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:28.700
seasons. In an interview several years later, Hurwitz reflected on some of the criticisms the

01:23:28.700 --> 01:23:34.540
season got. It got positioned in the press saying, even Hurwitz thought it wasn't his best work.

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:39.340
Well, actually, I did think it was my best work, but I did acknowledge that it was and wasn't.

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:44.780
The other thing that was interesting about it is that some articles will say,

01:23:44.780 --> 01:23:51.260
so-so reception, but it wasn't so-so. It was, this is great, or this is horrible. And even that

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:55.900
is what you hope for. I mean, you don't hope for this is horrible, but you do hope to do something

01:23:55.980 --> 01:24:00.780
that's novel enough at a certain point in your career that people have strong reactions to it.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:05.420
It's hard to map out the overall interest in a TV series over the span of years,

01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:10.460
particularly when it isn't on the air and there are no ratings to consult. But as a show that

01:24:10.460 --> 01:24:15.740
lived off the hype of the internet, interest in arrested development can be seen, at least in part,

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:21.260
on a Google Trends graph. Looking at how interest has changed since 2004, we can see it regularly

01:24:21.260 --> 01:24:26.060
scoring above 10 for over a decade, shooting up slightly when news broke about its return at the

01:24:26.060 --> 01:24:32.300
New Yorker festival reunion. Interest in the show exploded for its fourth season debut, but then

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:37.420
dropped entirely. What's most interesting, though, is that while previous years had the show scoring

01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:43.020
a 10 on the interest scale, give or take one or two, after season four it was scoring either a six

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:48.460
or seven. That's a drop of roughly 40% of interest in the show. While it's probably the case that

01:24:48.460 --> 01:24:53.580
stories about the rumored movie helped bolster interest earlier on, it's also true that, for

01:24:53.580 --> 01:24:58.620
some fans, season four undercut a lot of their interest in this series. The late spike in the

01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:03.260
interest chart does point to something else, though, and that's the show's eventual return for fifth

01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:09.020
season on Netflix, split into two parts, each being eight episodes. In spite of the mixed response to

01:25:09.020 --> 01:25:13.740
the fourth season, there was no hesitation on all the parties involved creatively to do more,

01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:18.700
Hurwitz explained, saying, the studio wanted to do it, Netflix wanted to do it, the actors wanted

01:25:18.700 --> 01:25:23.500
to do it, I wanted to do it, but we all have to want to do it at the same time. Ahead of the release

01:25:23.500 --> 01:25:28.460
of the fifth season, we did get a second look at the fourth, though. On May 3rd, 2018, Netflix

01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:33.980
released a re-edited version of the fourth season called, Fateful Consequences. This version of the

01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:39.180
season would remix the series so that the story was told in a more chronological order. Instead

01:25:39.260 --> 01:25:43.820
of focusing on a single character, episodes would include scenes from the stories of multiple

01:25:43.820 --> 01:25:49.180
characters. So what was once an episode that only followed Job would be replaced by an episode that

01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:54.940
followed Job, George Sr., and Buster. Episodes were also much shorter, being kept to a stricter 22

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.580
minute length. The season also ended up running for a few episodes longer because of that. A few

01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:04.620
scenes were cut, including jokes that no longer made sense with the newly edited versions, and

01:26:04.620 --> 01:26:09.260
a few were added in using additional audio that was recorded. It also introduced a lot more

01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:14.060
narration to help fill in the blanks created when future events no longer had teases in earlier

01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:19.580
episodes. There were aspects of this series that simply couldn't be changed, such as how few scenes

01:26:19.580 --> 01:26:23.740
featured the Blue Family interacting with each other, and for jokes that fell flat the first time

01:26:23.740 --> 01:26:30.060
around, they didn't really get better the second. The reaction to the remix was, well, mixed. Five

01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:34.620
years after the original had aired, it found a loyal group of fans who enjoyed its structural

01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:39.020
departure from the first three seasons, and there were fans of the early seasons who appreciated it

01:26:39.020 --> 01:26:43.180
feeling more like those ones. If you're interested in watching the fourth season on Netflix,

01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:48.140
it's the remixed version that's presented on its page for season four. To find the original

01:26:48.140 --> 01:26:53.020
cut of the fourth season, you have to look under the trailers and more sections just to spot it.

01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:58.060
While the original cut had five years for people to ponder its significance, the remix would not

01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:02.940
have nearly as much time as only days after it was released, Netflix announced that the first

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:08.300
half of season five of Arrested Development would be aired a few weeks later, on May 29th,

01:27:08.300 --> 01:27:14.300
2018. But there would be a few bumps on the way to that release. A few months before the release

01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:19.900
of the fifth season, Jeffrey Tambor, who had been starring in the series Transparent, was fired

01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:24.140
after he was alleged to have sexually harassed several women working on the production.

01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:28.940
Afterwards, in an interview about the incident, Tambor admitted to having been difficult on the

01:27:28.940 --> 01:27:34.140
set, though he insisted that he had not crossed the line into sexual harassment. When the news

01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:39.020
broke, filming for the fifth season of Arrested Development had already been completed, and Tambor

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:43.420
was too integral to the series to be edited out, so it was never seriously considered to do that

01:27:43.420 --> 01:27:48.460
season without him. In an interview, Mitch Hurwitz said, We were done shooting. There was no version

01:27:48.460 --> 01:27:53.020
of cutting him out of the show, or there would be no show. Am I going to cut Jeffrey out of the show

01:27:53.020 --> 01:27:58.220
based on allegations that he disputes, that Amazon hasn't shared, and that we have never experienced

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:03.100
any complaints about? No, of course I am not going to. I'm going to support Jeffrey.

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:07.740
Netflix head of content Ted Sarandos also expressed that Tambor had never been anything

01:28:07.740 --> 01:28:11.900
but professional in their history working together. However, ahead of the premiere,

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:16.140
Jeffrey Tambor sat down for an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, where he mentioned that he had

01:28:16.140 --> 01:28:21.100
a blow-up on the set of Arrested Development while filming its fifth season with Jessica Walter.

01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:26.540
He added that he profusely apologized afterwards, but it raised a question that would come up in

01:28:26.540 --> 01:28:31.740
several interviews with the press as the fifth season was being promoted, and most crucially,

01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:35.900
in an interview with The New York Times. The interview included Jessica Walter,

01:28:35.900 --> 01:28:41.340
Jeffrey Tambor, Jason Bateman, David Cross, Tony Ale, and Aliyah Shawkat. During the interview,

01:28:41.340 --> 01:28:45.900
the subject came up of Jeffrey Tambor's behavior on the set of Arrested Development's fifth season.

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:50.380
Although Jessica Walter was the subject, Jason Bateman and David Cross talked over her,

01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:54.940
coming to the defense of Tambor. It went on for a bit, until we finally got to hear

01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:58.540
from Jessica Walter. Here's audio from that moment in the interview.

01:29:20.380 --> 01:29:29.580
I have to let go of being angry at him. He never crossed the line on our show with any,

01:29:29.580 --> 01:29:36.620
you know, sexual, whatever. Verbally, yes, he harassed me, but he did apologize. I have to

01:29:36.620 --> 01:29:44.300
let it go, and I have to give you a chance to, you know, for us to be friends again. But it's hard,

01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:49.820
because honestly, Jason says this happens all the time. In like almost 60 years of working,

01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:55.420
I've never had anybody yell at me like that on a set. And it's hard to deal with it, but I'm

01:29:55.420 --> 01:30:01.660
over it now. I just let it go right here for The New York Times. She didn't give it up for anybody

01:30:01.660 --> 01:30:07.500
else. Hearing the emotion in Jessica Walter's voice and just how extreme the harassment, and

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:12.620
as she plainly says, the worst she's experienced in her career, it does bring the incident into

01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:17.580
perspective. And it's unfortunate that in that moment of the interview, Jason Bateman, David Cross,

01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:22.460
and Tony Hale all had moments where they seemed more concerned about repairing Jeffrey Tambor's

01:30:22.460 --> 01:30:27.980
reputation than giving Walter the space she needed to tell her story about what happened.

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:32.700
Although Walter herself was ready to move on, there was significant backlash to the interview.

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:37.740
Jason Bateman, David Cross, and Tony Hale all issued apologies. Bateman's apology on Twitter

01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.580
was particularly frank, saying,

01:30:39.580 --> 01:30:43.740
I was so eager to let Jeffrey know that he was supported in an attempt to learn, grow,

01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:48.700
and apologize that I completely underestimated the feelings of the victim, another person I deeply

01:30:48.700 --> 01:30:52.940
love. And she was sitting right there. I'm incredibly embarrassed and deeply sorry to have

01:30:52.940 --> 01:30:57.900
done that to Jessica. This is a big learning moment for me. There's never any excuse for

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:03.420
abuse in any form from any gender, and the victim's voice needs to be heard and respected.

01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:07.740
In response to a greater understanding of the incident, Hurwitz said in an interview,

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:13.180
I realize now I clearly misread the situation, given how Jessica has revealed she felt about it.

01:31:13.260 --> 01:31:18.380
There was more to it than I realized, and it's not my place to opine about what I believe was the

01:31:18.380 --> 01:31:23.100
weight of it. I misinterpreted what I understood to have played out, and more importantly, the depth

01:31:23.100 --> 01:31:28.300
of Jessica's pain about it. I felt so bad about that. I feel bad because I love these people.

01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:32.620
I feel bad for very personal reasons. And because I had been viewing this through the lens of a

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:38.380
family member who assumed that any discord, regardless of who was upset with who, existed

01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:42.540
within the context of a family that cared about each other. And that was a mistake.

01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:46.860
Of course we were at work, and we're not really related. That's why we have different last names,

01:31:46.860 --> 01:31:51.980
and I wish I'd known or made a greater effort to know the pain it caused. Speaking to Vice a few

01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:56.780
weeks later, Aaliyah Shawkat, the only person in the interview who seemed to intervene on behalf

01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:01.180
of Jessica, offered more reflections on the incident. I looked at Jessica and I could see

01:32:01.180 --> 01:32:05.820
how it was sitting with her, and it wasn't good. She comes in and she tries to speak for a little

01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:11.340
while, and again they keep going. In that room, when I look back on it, I wish I was able to

01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:16.780
gather myself to not be afraid to speak out war and realize that I wouldn't be hurting anybody,

01:32:16.780 --> 01:32:21.580
but actually helping. I know I said a little, but what I wish I had said was,

01:32:21.580 --> 01:32:27.980
stop talking, stop, Jessica, go on. There's a lot of men who have not been accused of anything that

01:32:27.980 --> 01:32:32.700
haven't taken the time to think about this. What's more important to me is that these men,

01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:36.620
whether they've been accused of anything or not, need to start looking at this movement and

01:32:36.620 --> 01:32:41.580
realizing it has a lot to do with them. I hope that the guys on the show and now all these men

01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:46.140
of all different ages start to communicate with the women in their lives, the women they work with,

01:32:46.140 --> 01:32:51.820
and just ask openly with no shame, what can I do to be better? One response to the interview,

01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:57.020
from Linda Holmes writing for NPR, cut to the heart of why this particular interview managed

01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:02.300
to resonate so strongly. It's not the worst story, not by a mile. It may not even be Tambor's

01:33:02.300 --> 01:33:07.420
worst story, but seeing a woman so brilliant withstand repeated efforts by people who say

01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:14.060
they love her to recast her experiences as normal when she knew they were not, it was a lot to take.

01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:18.940
It should also be mentioned that Jessica Walter never stepped forward with her story of her own

01:33:18.940 --> 01:33:24.300
will. It was revealed by Jeffrey Tambor and she was then forced to comment on it directly herself.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:29.260
Whether it was a positive story or not, it really is their own personal right to tell their story,

01:33:29.260 --> 01:33:33.820
including whether or not they want to share it at all. The incidents regarding Tambor were not the

01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:38.220
only popular subjects that came up during the press tour though. Many connections had been made

01:33:38.220 --> 01:33:42.700
between the Blue family and the Trump family at the time. A group of immoral developers, one of

01:33:42.700 --> 01:33:47.020
whom was running for office with a slogan about building a wall in the southern border, the

01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:51.180
connection was pretty clear and the show wasn't going to pretend it didn't exist. This was also

01:33:51.180 --> 01:33:56.060
seen as a way for bringing Arrested Development back to its roots, making it the way it once was.

01:33:56.060 --> 01:33:58.460
In another interview Hurwitz elaborated saying,

01:33:58.460 --> 01:34:02.620
nobody has quite dealt with the mess they've made. It makes me think of what was going on with

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:07.020
America. We're all growing. We're finally having an African-American president. We're finally

01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:11.740
acknowledging transgender people and allowing gay marriage. And then it's like, no, let's pretend

01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:16.220
none of that happened. Let's just go back to what it was. It's just easier. So that's a big

01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:22.060
undercurrent in this. He laughs. Which is also funny because it's what the fans want. Just go back.

01:34:22.060 --> 01:34:27.260
Make it great again. Make Arrested Greedy again. One other change that would face the fifth season

01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:32.460
of Arrested Development was the absence of Portia de Rossi. In 2017, at her request,

01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:37.660
she was written off the series scandal and had intended to step away from acting entirely to

01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:43.020
focus on her new business, an art curation and publication company called General Public. However,

01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:48.140
she did make an exception for Arrested Development. Although her appearance would be very limited,

01:34:48.140 --> 01:34:52.540
only appearing in a handful of episodes, making her storyline of running for Congress far less

01:34:52.540 --> 01:34:57.340
prominent than originally planned. The lead in to the fifth season didn't generate nearly as

01:34:57.340 --> 01:35:01.340
much buzz as the fourth season. The atmosphere around the show was almost a night and day

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:11.340
difference heading into the fifth season premiere. Because of its connection to the previous season,

01:35:11.340 --> 01:35:16.780
there are quite a few recaps in the early episodes of season five. The first episode opens with four

01:35:16.780 --> 01:35:21.500
minutes worth of them. Although season five was an attempt to return Arrested Development to its

01:35:21.500 --> 01:35:26.780
earlier formula, it did carry over the idea of a season-long narrative that season four used. The

01:35:26.780 --> 01:35:31.500
first three seasons have arcs that lasted multiple episodes, but they were often discrete and not part

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:35.900
of a larger narrative that many of the arcs in season four and five were. It makes for a more

01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:41.180
cohesive experience, though it does cost the show some of the manic energy of those earlier seasons.

01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:46.540
The attempt to shift back to an earlier format and not being able to get there reflects a major theme

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:51.580
through the season, feelings of regret of trying to recapture the past. After being punched in the

01:35:51.580 --> 01:35:56.780
face by his son, the dynamic between them now carries the implicit threat of violence.

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:14.540
The uniquely American character of the Bluths is reflected in George Michael's trip to Mexico,

01:36:14.540 --> 01:36:17.500
made comfortable with how Americanized the country is.

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:30.620
To make it even more explicit, the show also makes direct references to the U.S. government.

01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:45.420
The Obama call-out, at a time when the Trump administration was being criticized for its border

01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:50.380
policy, is especially clever. It reveals how partisanship blinds people to the cruelty that

01:36:50.380 --> 01:36:56.060
is consistent in American policies towards its southern border, regardless of the party and power.

01:36:56.060 --> 01:37:01.260
One side may be worse, but neither is good. In that way, the show is critiquing the right-wing

01:37:01.260 --> 01:37:06.300
shift in American politics and the response to it during the Trump years. Going back to the way

01:37:06.300 --> 01:37:11.820
things were isn't enough of a correction. People need to demand genuine political change, or as seen

01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:16.300
in the case of Maybee, take matters into their own hands the way she did and start helping out

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:21.660
directly. Not that Maybee really sticks with it. One thing that the show is very quick to remind

01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:26.860
people of is that the Bluths will never be our saviors, even though they certainly project the

01:37:26.860 --> 01:37:39.580
idea that they've grown. But their left-wing politics are entirely performative.

01:37:51.660 --> 01:37:58.460
This is being used to criticize a narrative that was being built at the time. The Bluths

01:37:58.460 --> 01:38:03.340
represent conservatives who were, supposedly, turning into liberals as a response to the

01:38:03.340 --> 01:38:08.460
hard-right turn of the Republican Party. The show is revealing these people, like the Bluths,

01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:14.140
to be grifters cynically using the Trump backlash liberals express to accrue power for themselves,

01:38:14.140 --> 01:38:18.380
acting the part of a sensitive, caring family while literally building a wall on the southern

01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:23.180
border. These are people who feed on the politics of hate. And to nail this point home, we see

01:38:23.180 --> 01:38:28.700
Lindsay lean into the cruelty once Maybee, her campaign manager, realizes it plays well to a

01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:43.820
certain part of the electorate. And just like that, the liberal posturing fades away when there's

01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:48.460
an opportunity to seize real power. It isn't that the Bluths find someone like Donald Trump

01:38:48.460 --> 01:38:52.940
objectionable. As former pals with the Bush administration, they just don't like the idea

01:38:52.940 --> 01:38:57.660
of another odious person taking the party from them. This cynical form of politics, where people

01:38:57.660 --> 01:39:02.140
are motivated to vote through hatred, either towards a group of people or a political candidate,

01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:07.340
is highlighted when Debris, posing as Lindsay during a parade, wears a sheet because of her

01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:27.100
anxiety. Arrested development is taking a very hard stance against the politics of hate,

01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:32.540
and how it exists across the electoral spectrum. Rather than simply admonish the Bluths entirely,

01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:37.260
the season does offer an interesting insight into why that family is so broken.

01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:41.660
It's foreshadowed early on when Tobias has some surprisingly wise words for Lucille.

01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:59.100
In the second half of the season, we go back in time to get an idea of where some of this hurt

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:03.900
comes from. We see the Bluths in their summer home, back when Job, Michael, Lindsay, and Buster

01:40:03.900 --> 01:40:20.140
were all children. We also meet Grandma Mimi, played by Jean Smart, who reveals where Lucille

01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:32.300
got her mean streak. The younger Lucille is played by Cobie Smulders. These scenes set in the past

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:37.580
unfolded the episode surrounding Buster's trial, as he's the top suspect in the murder of Lucille,

01:40:37.580 --> 01:40:47.660
too. There's a subtle hint that the jury is turning against him. Luckily, one surprise witness

01:40:47.660 --> 01:41:05.580
starts to turn the trial on its head. Jean's testimony did not help Buster. The trial also

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:10.700
reveals that the flashbacks we had seen in several episodes were actually a TV series being produced

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:32.220
by Ron Howard based on the life of Buster and the death of Mimi. Although things look grim for

01:41:32.220 --> 01:41:37.180
Buster having been accused of murdering his grandmother and Lucille, too, Michael, fulfilling

01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:53.020
his dream of being a lawyer, manages to turn the whole thing around. In this moment, Michael is

01:41:53.020 --> 01:41:58.140
fulfilling his destiny of holding the Bluth family together, being the hero he always imagined himself

01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:17.420
to be by revealing himself to be a murderer. Michael's idea of himself as a hero, coupled

01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:22.780
with doing something monstrous, helps him reveal what it means to be a hero in the Bluth family,

01:42:22.780 --> 01:42:26.620
and that can be extended to reframe his domineering parenting of George Michael as

01:42:26.620 --> 01:42:31.580
monstrous as well. He treats his son the way his father treated him, thinking he was a hero

01:42:31.580 --> 01:42:37.260
doing it the whole time. So while George Michael consistently resists his father, Michael tries to

01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:42.540
hold his son even closer. George Michael struggles to create distance and hold on to his family

01:42:42.540 --> 01:42:47.820
identity, wanting to stay connected in this relationship that's shaping him into someone

01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:49.820
more like his father than he'd like to admit.

01:42:56.620 --> 01:43:06.460
Michael and George Michael finally decide to settle things.

01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:22.140
Except this is a scheme, too, because if there's one thing the Bluths excel at, it's scheming.

01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:41.260
George Michael and Michael have learned to work together, not against one another,

01:43:41.260 --> 01:43:45.740
and while that still takes the shape of being Bluths, screwing over some other people,

01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:49.820
they seem to have made it work well enough that at least they aren't hurting each other,

01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:55.100
and maybe by trusting each other they can start to rebuild their lives into something better.

01:43:55.100 --> 01:43:59.820
And in the finale we find out the truth about Lindsay's parents. She's actually Lucille's

01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:19.100
half-sister. And as it looks like the family is coming together, Michael and George Michael do

01:44:19.100 --> 01:44:23.420
what they do best, and that's take-off. And it wasn't Michael that killed Lucille, too. That

01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:34.460
was Buster. And that's how season 5 came to an end. Plotlines colliding, traditions being

01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:39.260
upheld, and a stark reminder that the Bluths are everything that's bad with America. We don't get

01:44:39.260 --> 01:44:44.540
a tease for the next season, there is no epilogue, and there are no other signs we might see the

01:44:44.540 --> 01:44:50.780
Bluths once again in the future. Just a stair car exiting stage left, leaving Sudden Valley,

01:44:50.780 --> 01:45:00.860
perhaps forever. The fifth season of Arrested Development did not receive nearly as much

01:45:00.860 --> 01:45:06.860
attention as the fourth, and was similarly not as passionately hated or appreciated. Although the

01:45:06.860 --> 01:45:11.260
interview in the New York Times got a lot of attention, that didn't translate to people

01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:16.460
talking about the show's return very much. The content of the show didn't do much to help,

01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:21.980
while it may not have been bad, and in some ways it was pretty good. It was clear that the show

01:45:21.980 --> 01:45:25.900
wasn't going to have the impact it once did, and while it was clever to weave that into the

01:45:25.900 --> 01:45:31.260
narrative, it may not have come together as well as had been intended. In the third episode of the

01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:35.500
fifth season, there's a reference to a very old internet meme, the Star Wars Kid.

01:45:36.380 --> 01:45:48.060
This was referenced in the original run of Arrested Development, as well as the season

01:45:48.060 --> 01:45:54.460
for revival. Not only is this joke now 16 years old being an internet meme, it feels even more

01:45:54.460 --> 01:46:00.140
dated. Arrested Development is similarly starting to feel tired. While I appreciate a long-running

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:05.820
gag as much as anyone, even Jean Parmesan, not every joke is built to last, and comedy is

01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:11.500
infamous for aging poorly. The Star Wars Kid joke, for example, is not just an early meme,

01:46:11.500 --> 01:46:16.380
but one of the first major incidents of a teen being bullied by the internet. The poor kid's

01:46:16.380 --> 01:46:21.180
life got turned upside down because a video that was posted by someone else made him a laughing

01:46:21.180 --> 01:46:25.900
stock. While in some ways the series was fairly good about growing over time and discarding some

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:31.020
of its more controversial material, there were still moments like this that really made the show

01:46:31.020 --> 01:46:36.860
feel trapped in the past, and all for preserving a cruel joke that was long past its expiration

01:46:36.860 --> 01:46:41.580
date. More than a stale joke, the series itself felt like it was treading water. The Bluths are

01:46:41.580 --> 01:46:46.620
terrible people, and it's an intergenerational phenomena that can be extrapolated to the American

01:46:46.620 --> 01:46:52.300
experience. Lovely, but does it need to return every five years to deliver that message again?

01:46:52.300 --> 01:46:57.180
The fifth season is, of course, not irredeemable. The political commentary was sharp, the Michael

01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:01.820
and George Michael story did take some interesting steps forward, and there were some genuine laughs

01:47:01.820 --> 01:47:06.780
to be had. But as a show, it struggled to capture anyone's attention, as can be seen in much of the

01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:11.740
audience's reaction. In an article for The Verge, Keith Phipps summed it up nicely, saying,

01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:16.860
Arrested Development was once a special show, now it's a show struggling to remind viewers why

01:47:16.940 --> 01:47:22.540
it's special. This raises the important question, is this the end for Arrested Development? In an

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:28.060
interview, Mitch Hurwitz expressed a desire to do more. Here's an excerpt from a 2018 article.

01:47:28.060 --> 01:47:33.340
It flows so easily out of this cast. It's hard not to want to do more. It may be another epic

01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:38.540
way. We've always been underdogs, he says. Nobody ever got cocky. Really, we're all still

01:47:38.540 --> 01:47:44.140
trust-trying so hard. So actually, the every few years thing works great for me, because it's hard

01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:49.660
to get a laugh through to that screen. The cast was less committed, though Will Arnett offered an

01:47:49.660 --> 01:47:59.340
interesting perspective, saying, Mitch has written out versions where each one of us is the last

01:47:59.340 --> 01:48:03.660
person, depending on who lasted the longest. And I predict it will be me. Yeah, I'm gonna

01:48:03.660 --> 01:48:08.620
outlive everyone. David Cross, speaking on a podcast, seemed less convinced that the show

01:48:08.620 --> 01:48:13.180
would ever return. In particular, he cited the challenging work schedule and the hardship of it

01:48:13.180 --> 01:48:18.060
on the cast. Now, you can definitively say it's over. It's over. How do you know that?

01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:27.900
I know. Yeah, we didn't have full scripts. It was a terrible way for actors to try to do what they

01:48:27.900 --> 01:48:34.380
do. And there were a lot of frustrations early on. The shoot kept extending. You're asking a

01:48:34.380 --> 01:48:40.300
lot of people, and especially older people, who just don't have the physical stamina that some

01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:48.140
younger cast and crew do. And it led to some tensions, and it was a very bad way to

01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:53.980
work. David Cross also said he believed the show was over back in 2010, though clearly,

01:48:53.980 --> 01:48:59.500
Fate had other plans for the show. Sadly, this time it seems like Fate took another turn,

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:04.940
and it's unlikely that Arrested Development will return, or at least, it can never be the same show

01:49:04.940 --> 01:49:13.580
again. Jason Bateman's career trajectory changed completely after Arrested Development ended its

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:18.860
third season. He went from appearing in sitcom pilots destined to fail to appearing in big-budget

01:49:18.860 --> 01:49:24.940
movies such as Horrible Bosses, Hancock, and Zootopia. Most notably, he starred in and directed

01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:31.740
several episodes of the Netflix series Ozark. Will Arnett's career experienced a big boost

01:49:31.740 --> 01:49:36.780
after appearing on the show, going on to appear in movies and TV shows, though perhaps it's voice

01:49:36.780 --> 01:49:41.980
work that's given him the most acclaim, having starred in Bojack Horseman and portrayed Lego

01:49:41.980 --> 01:49:47.420
Batman in multiple Lego movies. Portia de Rossi would go on to appear on the shows Better Off

01:49:47.420 --> 01:49:52.620
Ted, Niptuck, and Scandal, though as mentioned earlier, she would leave acting in 2018 and is

01:49:52.620 --> 01:49:58.140
now currently focusing on her new business venture, General Public. Michael Cera starred in the movies

01:49:58.140 --> 01:50:03.580
Superbad, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Juno, and a host of other projects that needed an awkward

01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:08.860
teen boy. In many ways, his style of teenage boy became a trend in the 2000s. Most recently,

01:50:08.860 --> 01:50:14.300
he voiced Hank in the movie Paws of Fury, The Legend of Hank. Aaliyah Shawkat has been very

01:50:14.300 --> 01:50:18.860
prolific since Arrested Development gave her career its first big break. She's appeared

01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:23.900
in dozens of TV shows and movies, most recently starring in the series Search Party, which ended

01:50:23.900 --> 01:50:29.580
its fifth season in early 2022. Tony Hale would appear in a number of projects after Arrested

01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:34.140
Development changed his career, including a lengthy run on the series Veep. Most recently,

01:50:34.140 --> 01:50:39.420
he's appeared in Hocus Pocus 2 and done voice work for the Harley Quinn TV series. Jeffrey

01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:44.700
Tambor's career has come to a halt after he was fired from Transparent for allegedly sexually

01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:50.060
harassing several of the women who worked on the production. Jessica Walter would take on another

01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:55.500
Lucille Bluth-esque role as Mallory Archer on the show Archer. In interviews promoting the

01:50:55.500 --> 01:51:00.220
fifth season of Arrested Development, when asked if she would return to the show, she believed that

01:51:00.220 --> 01:51:05.660
within five years she would be too old to keep acting. Sadly, she would only be around for

01:51:05.660 --> 01:51:12.860
another three. She plastered away in her sleep on March 24, 2021. Classic is a term that's given

01:51:12.860 --> 01:51:18.860
to a work of art that either has or is expected to pass the test of time. Remembered well after

01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:24.060
its debut and often outliving the artist or artists who created it. Arrested Development

01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:28.700
had the immense advantage of achieving a cult's status amongst a passionate viewership and critics

01:51:28.700 --> 01:51:34.380
with its first three seasons. In 2012, its position as a classic might have been guaranteed,

01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:40.460
depending on who you asked, but its divisive return in 2013 and its less-noticed return in 2018

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:46.300
have complicated that confidence in its classic status. Art isn't created in a vacuum, and it's

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:51.580
through influencing new art that older works are often remembered, and by being remembered,

01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:56.540
become more likely to be thought of as a classic. So in that sense, those are the viewers who may

01:51:56.540 --> 01:52:01.580
matter the most. Arrested Development will be remembered as a great work of art by being

01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:05.580
remembered by artists who will go on to create great works of art of their own,

01:52:05.580 --> 01:52:12.140
creating a vast tapestry of classic television. Arrested Development may or may not be over,

01:52:12.140 --> 01:52:16.860
or at the very least, if it comes back, it certainly can't be the same without Jessica

01:52:16.860 --> 01:52:22.060
Walter. But its status as a classic doesn't seem to be under a serious threat. It may speak to the

01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:26.060
strength of the original three seasons, but perhaps more importantly, it speaks to the

01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:30.220
strength of the memory of those seasons in the minds that made the show a classic.

01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:37.820
Can you tell that this video took nearly seven hours to record? Yeah, it's one of my longest ever,

01:52:37.820 --> 01:52:44.620
and it was a challenge writing something this big for a show that didn't even last 100 episodes.

01:52:44.620 --> 01:52:50.060
All of this coming together in one big package. I really hope it is good and people enjoyed it.

01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:53.180
If you are someone who enjoyed it and you're thinking, I'd like to see more of those,

01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:56.220
well, I've got a bunch of other TV show retrospectives you can check out,

01:52:56.220 --> 01:53:01.020
and you can also make sure I keep making more in the future by supporting this channel financially.

01:53:01.020 --> 01:53:05.660
You can become a patron or a member, and you'll get your name floating up the screen, like all

01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:10.700
these lovely people here. In addition to that, you'll get early access to new videos as I make

01:53:10.700 --> 01:53:15.580
them, plus other fun extras that I throw in every now and again. If you would like to support the

01:53:15.580 --> 01:53:20.940
channel in a non-monetary fashion though, you can do that by liking, commenting, and subscribing if

01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:25.340
you haven't already, and do hit the bell for notifications. I want to thank everyone so much

01:53:25.340 --> 01:53:31.180
for watching all the way until the end, and this was a real challenge to narrate, and I

01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:34.300
want to ask Ron Howard, how do you think I did?

01:53:34.300 --> 01:53:36.540
Real shoddy narrating, just pure crap.

01:53:37.580 --> 01:53:38.940
F*** you, Ron.
