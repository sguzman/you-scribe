00:00.000 --> 00:07.040
The world is great, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.

00:07.040 --> 00:11.760
Every year we have a deluge of conservative non-fiction containing the wisdom of pundits

00:11.760 --> 00:16.880
and politicians alike. Many of these books pop up on bestseller lists, often under suspicious

00:16.880 --> 00:21.680
circumstances, only to vanish a few weeks later. They're marketed as fan merchandise, to be

00:21.680 --> 00:26.000
consumed, though not deeply understood, and they fit neatly into a publishing niche where

00:26.000 --> 00:30.720
some conservative authors put away their long-standing grudges for a chance to make some money.

00:30.720 --> 00:36.400
Here's one example. Candace Owens recently had her book reach the New York Times bestseller list.

00:36.400 --> 00:39.600
Here was her response on Twitter.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.880
So excited about this. I'm officially a New York Times best-selling author.

00:43.520 --> 00:49.280
High five, emojis. And five days later, she had this to say about the New York Times.

00:49.280 --> 00:52.880
It's time for our Department of Justice to begin looking into the New York Times.

00:52.960 --> 00:56.400
Here's a fun fact. This is the tweet that Dave Rubin blocked me for.

00:56.400 --> 01:00.800
I was really just posting two screencaps of tweets he had made, and they read,

01:00.800 --> 01:05.040
The world controls tried to burn it, but failed miserably. Now a New York Times bestseller,

01:05.040 --> 01:09.760
and number one in the political freedom category. And then a bunch of fire emojis.

01:09.760 --> 01:10.720
The second tweet read,

01:11.600 --> 01:15.760
Also, the dirty secret of the publishing world is that the New York Times bestseller list is almost

01:15.760 --> 01:21.120
a total fabrication. It's not based on sales. They have a secret formula. Yes, really.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.400
It's nice to see these conservatives pretend, at least for a brief moment,

01:24.400 --> 01:29.360
that the New York Times is reputable. So long as they can advertise the sales of their own book,

01:29.360 --> 01:34.400
of course. These books have such catchy titles. What's so great about America?

01:34.400 --> 01:39.200
The three C's that make America great. How to destroy America in three easy steps.

01:39.200 --> 01:45.600
Death of a Nation. Adios America. Of the Izing. Stupid black man.

01:45.600 --> 01:48.320
In defense of internment. That's real.

01:48.880 --> 01:54.720
Killing the mob. Killing Crazy Horse. Killing the SS. Killing England. Killing Patton. Killing

01:54.720 --> 01:59.280
Kennedy. Killing Lincoln. Killing the rising sun. Killing Reagan. Killing Jesus. That doesn't work.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.320
Killing the killers. Finally, someone stop them.

02:02.320 --> 02:06.080
These are a tiny fraction of the many books published in the last two decades by conservative

02:06.080 --> 02:11.040
pundits and politicians. Comparatively, you don't see as many by left-wing pundits. For example,

02:11.040 --> 02:16.160
Bill O'Reilly alone has written more books than the entire MSNBC prime time lineup.

02:16.160 --> 02:20.240
Many of these books have a recurring theme. That America is an exceptional nation,

02:20.240 --> 02:25.200
filled with greatness. And there are forces, typically on the left, that want to destroy it.

02:25.200 --> 02:29.120
I wanted to dig into some of these books, so I headed over to my local library and picked

02:29.120 --> 02:32.720
out the first three books in the political science section by conservative authors.

02:33.600 --> 02:37.520
The first was How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps by Ben Shapiro.

02:37.520 --> 02:41.760
Second was Addicted to Outrage, How Thinking Like a Recovering Addict Can Heal the Country

02:41.760 --> 02:47.680
by Glenn Beck. And the last was Don't Burn This Book, Thinking for Yourself in the Age of Unreason

02:47.680 --> 02:53.600
by Dave Rubin. Let's dive into the knowledge, polemics, and philosophy hidden within the pages

02:53.600 --> 03:00.000
of these books. How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps is not a great title. The three things

03:00.000 --> 03:04.400
discussed aren't really steps and they are definitely not easy, but before we get to them,

03:04.400 --> 03:08.560
we have to go through some political theory invented by Ben Shapiro himself.

03:08.560 --> 03:12.960
Shapiro splits Americans into two camps, those who want to hold America together,

03:12.960 --> 03:18.480
or as he dubs them, unionists, and those who want to destroy America, who he calls

03:18.480 --> 03:24.080
disintegrationists. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? According to Shapiro, this isn't a

03:24.080 --> 03:28.160
simple left-right divide, as he mentions there are forces on the left and right who can be

03:28.160 --> 03:33.520
disintegrationists, though he spends roughly 95% of the book criticizing the left, with a few pages

03:33.520 --> 03:37.920
thrown in where he complains about Marco Rubio and the alt-right even get a few paragraphs.

03:37.920 --> 03:42.320
When it comes to left-wing forces trying to destroy America, here's one example he offers.

03:42.320 --> 03:48.000
Mario Lopez committed the grave sin of suggesting that it would be dangerous as a parent to determine

03:48.000 --> 03:51.920
based on a three-year-old's gender confusion that the child is indeed suffering from gender

03:51.920 --> 03:56.960
dysphoria, adding, you're just a kid. This was enough to spur e to pressure Lopez for a public

03:56.960 --> 04:05.120
apology, which he duly gave. The man has a family to support. So do we all. This breathless description

04:05.120 --> 04:11.360
of Mario Lopez nearly having his life ruined had me laughing for a solid 15 seconds when I read it.

04:11.360 --> 04:16.080
As if Mario Lopez is one bad take from his family being destitute living on the streets.

04:16.720 --> 04:21.280
And this is representative of a lot of the supposed threats that this book details. Tiny

04:21.280 --> 04:26.080
examples cherry-picked and then exaggerated to an absurd extreme. And some examples are just

04:26.080 --> 04:31.040
flat-out distortions. Here's what one of those looks like. Disintegrationists have categorized

04:31.040 --> 04:36.160
culturally unifying symbols like the American flag as inherently divisive. If America, as a

04:36.160 --> 04:41.200
concept, is polarizing, so too is the flag. These sentences have a citation that will let us know

04:41.200 --> 04:45.200
why Ben is making this very extreme claim. According to the article cited in the book,

04:45.200 --> 04:49.120
this is taken from a new story about Traveler's Rest High School, where the principal banned

04:49.120 --> 04:53.760
bringing the American flag to football games. This was because students were taunting a visiting team

04:53.760 --> 04:58.400
from Berea High School, who were mostly Hispanic, by waving the flags in their face and shouting

04:58.400 --> 05:03.520
things like, go home, leading to confrontations in the stands. Reading the principal's reasoning

05:03.520 --> 05:08.880
hardly sounds like Shapiro's characterization. The principal wrote, using the American flag to

05:08.880 --> 05:15.120
display disrespect or unsportsmanlike behavior is, in itself, improper and disrespectful to our flag.

05:15.120 --> 05:19.840
He's clearly saying that it wasn't the American flag that was divisive. He was upset that the flag

05:19.840 --> 05:24.720
was being used as camouflage for an attack on Hispanic teenagers. A few days later, after a

05:24.720 --> 05:29.360
social media storm, the decision was reversed, although there was no criticism from Shapiro on

05:29.360 --> 05:34.800
the mob justice in action here. Also, if you're curious, all of this took place in the conservative

05:34.800 --> 05:40.160
Greenville County in the very conservative state of South Carolina, which hardly sounds like a

05:40.160 --> 05:44.400
stronghold for the left. In just this little excerpt, we can see that Shapiro has taken a

05:44.400 --> 05:49.280
single incident, lied about the intentions behind it, completely ignored the social media mob when

05:49.280 --> 05:54.480
it worked in his favor, and then extrapolated his straw man to an entire group he's made up.

05:54.480 --> 05:58.960
In other words, it's all a bunch of hot smoke. Now let's get to those three steps to destroy

05:58.960 --> 06:03.520
America. Step one in destroying America is convincing citizens that some people will

06:03.520 --> 06:07.840
have to sacrifice their existing rights in order for others to have new ones.

06:07.840 --> 06:11.840
What a wonderfully vague statement. Luckily, he expands on what he means by

06:11.840 --> 06:17.200
new rights. Saying that society can be improved because children can be molded into literally

06:17.200 --> 06:21.440
anything opens the door to life-or-death fights about what they will be molded into.

06:21.440 --> 06:25.680
It's hard to take Ben seriously when he uses terms such as literally anything,

06:25.680 --> 06:31.040
as if children are being molded into boulders or rainbows. Throughout this book, and in much of his

06:31.040 --> 06:35.680
rhetoric, Ben often characterizes the left in extreme terms to make them sound completely

06:35.680 --> 06:40.560
unreasonable. So if someone is saying, perhaps we should, for example, allow children to have a

06:40.560 --> 06:46.000
broader understanding of what gender means, is turned into literally anything. And when he writes

06:46.000 --> 06:51.360
vaguely like this, he can make his bigotry against, for example, trans people sound like some kind of

06:51.520 --> 06:56.640
high-minded principle. It's the intellectual camouflage for an ignorant and bigoted opinion.

06:56.640 --> 07:02.800
Ben argues quite forcibly that the world is the way it is because of some kind of natural order.

07:02.800 --> 07:07.840
He argues that the philosophy behind the founding of the United States of America,

07:07.840 --> 07:13.600
as espoused in its founding documents, represent an understanding of fundamental human nature,

07:13.600 --> 07:18.480
something Ben never quite defines. That by founding a nation based on this understanding

07:18.480 --> 07:23.200
of human nature, the United States has uniquely organized itself to best allow human life to

07:23.200 --> 07:27.680
flourish by respecting the natural rights of people. And hopefully alarm bells are going off

07:27.680 --> 07:32.080
because even a basic knowledge of American history should reveal how poorly America has respected

07:32.080 --> 07:36.480
the rights of people, but that will be addressed in the third step. Instead, the first is about

07:36.480 --> 07:41.760
asserting the importance of protecting American values. Shapiro goes on. We are not gods and

07:41.760 --> 07:46.480
simply do not have the capacity to rectify imbalances of innate individual qualities.

07:46.560 --> 07:50.560
We don't have the ability to guarantee that even two kids the same age living on the same street

07:50.560 --> 07:54.480
will start from the same point. Two children growing up in the same family don't even start

07:54.480 --> 07:58.960
from the same point. Shapiro is fixated on this idea of inherent differences,

07:58.960 --> 08:03.760
that outcomes can be explained on that basis. You could maybe argue that for individuals,

08:03.760 --> 08:08.000
in that when you see a person who has succeeded greatly in the world, it may be down to some kind

08:08.000 --> 08:12.800
of innate quality that has made success something easier for them. Though, of course, that discounts

08:12.800 --> 08:17.680
how luck can play a role in an individual's life. For example, the luck of being a failed screen

08:17.680 --> 08:21.600
writer who is fashioned into a conservative media figure by a billionaire trying to influence

08:21.600 --> 08:26.240
popular discourse on politics using millions of dollars to create the illusion of talent.

08:26.240 --> 08:30.080
Of course, none of this really matters when we're talking about groups of people. Reducing

08:30.080 --> 08:34.720
disparities to individual choices is a convenient way of ignoring structural and historic forces

08:34.720 --> 08:39.120
that shape our lives and reduce the chances of groups of people to succeed in the world.

08:39.120 --> 08:43.120
Unless the claim is the reason these groups aren't succeeding is because they have all

08:43.120 --> 08:49.120
independently made the same or similar individual choices as if these disparities between two groups

08:49.120 --> 08:54.320
are the reflection of some kind of natural defect. For example, if poor people are naturally

08:54.320 --> 08:59.600
destined to be poor because they are innately incapable of being anything else. Perhaps their

08:59.600 --> 09:04.240
innate intelligence, for instance, isn't high enough to succeed in the world. This, of course,

09:04.240 --> 09:09.440
is the justification of philosophies such as social Darwinism, which say that people's success

09:09.440 --> 09:15.040
in the world is a product of their inherent or natural abilities as opposed to historical or

09:15.040 --> 09:19.920
social forces that shape our lives. Of course, what this argument really does is undermine any

09:19.920 --> 09:25.280
attempt to change society for the better. Most of this book is an argument to keep society the way

09:25.280 --> 09:29.840
it is and avoid any attempt at improving the structures that shape our lives. There are a

09:29.840 --> 09:34.720
few cute moments of hypocrisy in this book, such as one part where Ben Shapiro complains that

09:34.720 --> 09:40.320
Elizabeth Warren was selling billionaire tears mugs. Ben Shapiro, the man who has for years

09:40.320 --> 09:45.440
been selling a tumbler that reads leftist tears. Though if you really want to shame Elizabeth

09:45.440 --> 09:51.120
Warren, accusing her of stealing jokes from Ben Shapiro would be devastating. As always, whenever

09:51.120 --> 09:56.160
we hear Ben Shapiro talking about being personally responsible and succeeding on your own merits,

09:56.240 --> 10:01.440
I very much recommend the Vanity Fair article that details how Ben Shapiro was able to succeed

10:01.440 --> 10:06.080
and become a conservative pundit, not through the strength of his own abilities, but through

10:06.080 --> 10:10.960
the careful craftsmanship of a public media persona through the help of his business partner,

10:10.960 --> 10:15.760
Jeremy Boring, and through the investment of millions of dollars to get his daily wire

10:15.760 --> 10:20.880
operation off the ground. Let's move on to the next step, though. Step two in destroying America

10:20.880 --> 10:25.440
is undermining our culture of rights in favor of a culture of protection by government.

10:25.440 --> 10:30.240
You may have noticed step two doesn't follow step one. Why would you need to create new rights

10:30.240 --> 10:35.280
in step one if you were creating a culture that undermines them? What Shapiro seems to be really

10:35.280 --> 10:40.800
upset by is this expansion of what rights mean, to be anything that he can't effectively tie to

10:40.800 --> 10:45.680
the founding documents of America. And of course, he is exclusively privileging his own interpretation

10:45.680 --> 10:51.040
of those founding documents. In this discussion of rights, I had expected some mention of the

10:51.040 --> 10:56.800
Universal Declaration of Human Rights published in 1948 and adopted by the United Nations,

10:56.800 --> 11:01.440
especially considering the American connection of Eleanor Roosevelt. But Ben doesn't really compare

11:01.440 --> 11:06.160
or contrast the American founding documents with anything. He describes the evolution of rights

11:06.160 --> 11:10.560
throughout much of the Enlightenment as leading up to America and that discussion ending with

11:10.560 --> 11:15.680
its founding, as if the American founding documents were so good and everything that's come afterward

11:15.680 --> 11:20.960
simply isn't worth acknowledging. He simply takes what he knows and seems to assume that it is the

11:21.120 --> 11:26.080
best and only version that should be considered. And his evidence for this is the greater material

11:26.080 --> 11:31.120
success of the United States on the world stage. History is simply following a script that was

11:31.120 --> 11:36.000
destined to happen, which leads us to this. The third and final step in destroying America is

11:36.000 --> 11:41.200
convincing citizens that America represents fruit of the poisonous tree, that America was founded

11:41.200 --> 11:46.160
in evil, and that there is no arc to history. To support this very heavy claim, we get a brief

11:46.160 --> 11:50.160
rundown of American history and this gives us a really good understanding of how Ben Shapiro's

11:50.160 --> 11:54.480
worldview is shaped. An honest recount of American history is a very mixed record. The

11:54.480 --> 11:58.880
country that helped fight fascism in World War II is the same one that enslaved millions for nearly

11:58.880 --> 12:04.080
a century. Shapiro acknowledges both sides of the record, but his framing is deeply suspect.

12:04.080 --> 12:08.800
Any and all crimes perpetrated by the American state are waved away as simply being products

12:08.800 --> 12:13.040
of their time, from the genocide of indigenous peoples, being reduced to the norm of nation

12:13.040 --> 12:18.240
states of the day, to slavery being an institution being practiced around the globe. I'm not sure how

12:18.240 --> 12:21.920
this is a defense. If he's trying to imply that we should criticize other countries for doing

12:21.920 --> 12:27.200
similar things, I fully agree. But instead he's using this to shield any direct criticism of

12:27.200 --> 12:32.000
America. This is probably best represented by a quote he uses that comes from Paul Johnson.

12:32.000 --> 12:36.320
Europeans were moving into the former hunting grounds of the world's primitive peoples in five

12:36.320 --> 12:41.920
continents. So when America is engaging in imperialism and seizing lands from indigenous

12:41.920 --> 12:47.440
peoples and waging war on its neighbors, it's acting as Europeans do. But whenever the United

12:47.440 --> 12:52.400
States writes something lovely in its founding documents, that is uniquely American. It's a

12:52.400 --> 12:58.000
highly selective reading of America, designed to emphasize the good as American and the bad as

12:58.000 --> 13:03.120
something foreign or belonging to the wider world. When discussing positive things the United States

13:03.120 --> 13:07.920
has done, such as the aforementioned fighting of fascism, the title sections as those as

13:07.920 --> 13:13.840
Savior of the West, something uniquely American that only this proud noble nation could accomplish,

13:13.840 --> 13:19.120
as if World War II was fought and won solely by the United States. It seems insulting to all the

13:19.120 --> 13:24.480
other nations that participated, but unsurprising as Ben doesn't seem concerned with the histories

13:24.480 --> 13:28.720
of other nations or the broader interactions between them unless it can be used to further

13:28.720 --> 13:33.680
glorify the United States. When discussing more negative aspects of American history,

13:33.680 --> 13:38.000
Shapiro tends to frame them as favorably as possible. Here's one example describing

13:38.000 --> 13:44.080
American westward expansion. Native American population density was, at the time, 0.17 persons

13:44.080 --> 13:48.880
per square mile. The Census Bureau historically considered any area unsettled with a population

13:48.880 --> 13:53.520
density of fewer than two people per square mile. In general, the pioneers were not wrong to

13:53.520 --> 13:58.160
cast their eyes westward, although as we will see this population movement had dire consequences

13:58.160 --> 14:03.440
for Native Americans. Ben doesn't even acknowledge the fact that the Census Bureau justifying

14:03.440 --> 14:08.160
westward expansion of the American state is ridiculously self-serving. He also makes no

14:08.160 --> 14:13.120
mention of the gold rush that sent scores of Americans west, or the concept of manifest

14:13.120 --> 14:18.640
destiny which created a religious justification for the American expansion. Instead, the only

14:18.640 --> 14:23.840
other factors he really mentions are the looming threat of European powers on the continent,

14:23.840 --> 14:29.120
which in many ways reads like the justifications of the day for moving westward, which led to many

14:29.120 --> 14:34.400
wars and the displacement and murder of countless indigenous people. Shapiro also feels the need to

14:34.400 --> 14:39.200
add that inter-tribal warfare was common between Native American tribes, and he spends time

14:39.200 --> 14:44.560
resisting the noble savage trope. And while I can understand wanting to push back against a stereotype

14:44.560 --> 14:49.440
like the noble savage, a better reading of history would be if he instead cast these indigenous

14:49.440 --> 14:54.960
peoples as human beings. In many ways, he seems to want the reader to not feel too sorry for these

14:54.960 --> 14:59.920
indigenous peoples who were slaughtered and had their waves of life destroyed. His overall view

14:59.920 --> 15:04.800
of history is that the bad is commonplace in the world, and even the victims aren't sates. But when

15:04.800 --> 15:10.880
they're as good, it becomes uniquely American. Or as Ben puts it, when we can find injustice within

15:10.880 --> 15:16.880
American history, that is our fault, but that is not America's fault. America was always great,

15:16.880 --> 15:22.720
even if she was never perfect. He constantly refers to the eternal and good values represented

15:22.720 --> 15:27.600
by America, something sacrosanct and unquestionable, and those who do question anything are to be

15:27.600 --> 15:32.880
regarded as disintegrationists trying to destroy the country. It's amazing how little thought went

15:32.880 --> 15:37.760
into this book. It's a collection of facts, often misinterpreted or misleading, and a series of

15:37.760 --> 15:42.560
premises that aren't even a quarter baked. This was obviously produced as a product to be consumed

15:42.560 --> 15:47.280
quickly and without much thought, the sort of thing for fans to buy, not to spark genuine political

15:47.280 --> 15:52.320
discussion. Ironically though, I think it's sincere. This probably is Ben Shapiro trying his best to

15:52.320 --> 15:56.480
write a thoughtful book about history and philosophy. He's just a bad writer and a shallow

15:56.480 --> 16:02.320
thinker. It's perhaps best embodied by this quote here. To most Americans, America is about, and was

16:02.320 --> 16:07.360
always about, the gradual realization of those beautiful promises, rights, and institutions for

16:07.360 --> 16:11.760
all Americans. Perhaps most of us never thought about all that. Perhaps we just saw the flag

16:11.760 --> 16:17.760
flying and felt it, or watched a 4th of July parade and knew it. The book isn't a serious appeal to

16:17.760 --> 16:22.000
any well thought out concept of America, but rather a vindication of feelings of pride one

16:22.000 --> 16:27.440
has when looking at the various symbols of America, a vindication of unthinking patriotism.

16:27.440 --> 16:32.720
Ben Shapiro has done the work of figuring out that America is great and blameless, so those

16:32.720 --> 16:36.400
reading this book don't have to think about it for themselves and continue their lives at

16:36.400 --> 16:41.520
normal, remembering to salute the flag. Those who would say otherwise threaten that complacency,

16:41.520 --> 16:46.080
possibly upsetting the natural order of things and ruining Ben's cushy life. So what Ben offers

16:46.080 --> 16:51.040
in a book like this is a security blanket, an unironic version of that Stephen Colbert book,

16:51.040 --> 16:55.600
America, re-becoming the greatness we never weren't. Let's move on to Glenn Beck's,

16:55.600 --> 16:59.680
addicted to outrage how thinking like a recovering addict can heal the country.

16:59.680 --> 17:04.800
We need a bit of context on Beck before we move forward though. This book was published in 2018,

17:04.800 --> 17:09.040
and in the years leading up to it, Beck had a bit of an identity crisis. He was a never Trump

17:09.040 --> 17:13.840
Republican, and during the 2016 election he tried to rebrand himself as a more moderate voice.

17:13.840 --> 17:18.400
By 2018 he was pivoting again, claiming that he had gotten Trump completely wrong and while he

17:18.400 --> 17:22.400
didn't like him stylistically, he thought he was doing a good job as president. This book is part

17:22.400 --> 17:27.440
of that pivot, reframes outrage in political discourse as a creation of the media, including

17:27.440 --> 17:32.400
himself in his earlier days. But he criticizes himself the same way he criticizes Trump.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.760
His tone isn't great, but he still thinks he was right on the facts.

17:35.760 --> 17:38.480
For those who don't remember some of those facts, here's a quick example.

17:43.840 --> 17:50.720
Nationalists, graft, acorn style organizations, revolution and hidden agenda.

17:51.600 --> 17:58.800
O-L-I-G-A-R-H. One letter is missing.

17:59.920 --> 18:08.720
Why did I select these words? Because acorn selects tides. They all select their words first

18:08.720 --> 18:16.960
and then tie them all together into one word. Oligarch, for quite the one that's missing, is why.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.560
I'm pretty sure oligarchy has a C in there too. But on the substance of this argument,

18:20.560 --> 18:25.040
you may have noticed that the Barack Obama presidency did not plunge America into some

18:25.040 --> 18:31.040
kind of socialist oligarchy. But this exemplifies a lot of what Glenn Beck's Fox News show was all

18:31.040 --> 18:36.080
about, telling us that Democrats are poised to create some kind of socialist hellscape.

18:36.080 --> 18:40.320
These are the supposed facts he stands by. Glenn Beck, in this book, is trying to present

18:40.320 --> 18:45.280
himself as a voice of reason. But he was never a reasonable guy, and he still isn't. And it

18:45.280 --> 18:50.480
has nothing to do with his theatrics. Have I stepped through a wormhole and come out in France?

18:50.480 --> 18:53.840
I mean, I'm not really sure if the... Look, there I am.

18:53.840 --> 18:57.200
Okay, maybe not nothing. But the problem runs a lot deeper than the silly stuff.

18:57.200 --> 19:02.640
Glenn Beck's book is a lot like Ben Shapiro's in that it hits similar notes. Although, to Beck's

19:02.640 --> 19:07.040
credit, he presents a more fact-based reading of history. He goes into far greater detail,

19:07.040 --> 19:11.120
bringing up specific crimes such as the Trail of Tears, where tens of thousands of Indigenous

19:11.120 --> 19:15.200
people were displaced and forced to march west, or the destruction of Tulsa's Black Wall Street,

19:15.200 --> 19:19.840
where a racist mob ransacked an affluent black community, killing many people and destroying

19:19.840 --> 19:25.040
that community's economy. When Glenn Beck gets to the good side of America, it seems thin in

19:25.040 --> 19:29.280
comparison to his chapter covering the bad. Though he weighs it all away with his discussion

19:29.280 --> 19:34.480
about the moral character of America. It's a weird reading of history where, instead of using

19:34.480 --> 19:38.960
it to understand the present, he instead would rather us look at history as a means for us to

19:38.960 --> 19:44.960
sit back and judge the past, to decipher whether America good or America bad. Beck seems to want

19:44.960 --> 19:48.960
us to ignore the past entirely when he writes, it's not what happens to you historically, what

19:48.960 --> 19:53.440
matter is what you do with it now. Unless he's talking about learning lessons from history about

19:53.440 --> 19:59.200
the left, ascending and bringing with it fascism. One example both Beck and Shapiro use to downplay

19:59.200 --> 20:03.760
the impact of historical discrimination is when they compare Asian communities to black ones,

20:03.760 --> 20:07.840
a comparison that is overly reductive as there are many different Asian and black communities

20:07.840 --> 20:12.080
within the United States representing different waves of immigration and different historical

20:12.080 --> 20:16.880
experiences. For example, using the case of Japanese Americans, which Ben Shapiro highlights

20:16.880 --> 20:22.320
specifically, the interment of Japanese Americans during World War II led to the United States

20:22.320 --> 20:26.560
government providing reparations, something that has never been done for black Americans who can

20:26.560 --> 20:31.200
trace their ancestry back to slavery, regardless of what anyone even thinks of reparations. The

20:31.200 --> 20:36.400
point I'm making here is that these two experiences are not the same, and to compare experiences like

20:36.400 --> 20:41.520
these two, as both Glenn Beck and Ben Shapiro do in their books, is misleading. Glenn Beck's book

20:41.520 --> 20:46.240
was also annoying to read as he tries to wrap this veil of respectability around himself still

20:46.240 --> 20:50.160
pushing the same ridiculous talking points he always had been. Great example is how he talks

20:50.160 --> 20:54.640
about climate change. Beck has a long history fighting against any sort of legislative solution

20:54.640 --> 20:58.880
to climate change, and to hear his side of the story, he isn't denying the science, he's simply

20:58.880 --> 21:03.280
concerned about the costs. Reading his book, he almost sounds reasonable when he writes,

21:03.280 --> 21:07.680
I believe that the globe is warming as much as we can trust and verify the trends. Let me accept

21:07.680 --> 21:12.320
the current claim that the world has warned by 0.7 degrees in the last hundred years. I also accept

21:12.320 --> 21:16.880
that man can do significant damage to the planet and has done some damage over the industrial age.

21:16.880 --> 21:20.960
It makes sense to me that belching toxins into the air is not good for any of us, including the

21:20.960 --> 21:25.840
planet and his other inhabitants over time. Aside from some shaky language, that sounds fine.

21:25.840 --> 21:30.160
But less than two pages later, he's saying, when you demand absolute acceptance of your theories

21:30.160 --> 21:34.880
and back up your science with arguments of moral outrage, you end up having to shove, shout, and,

21:34.880 --> 21:39.680
in the end, shoot. And then he goes on to compare climate change to religion and describes one side

21:39.680 --> 21:45.200
as the Spanish Inquisition. This, to me, does not sound like the beginning of a reasonable debate.

21:45.200 --> 21:50.720
This sounds like Glenn Beck is portraying one side as incapable of it. And more importantly,

21:50.720 --> 21:55.280
regardless of what Glenn Beck says about the people who accept broad scientific consensus,

21:55.280 --> 22:00.560
what exactly does he suggest we do about the aspects of climate change he's conceded are true?

22:00.560 --> 22:05.680
Well, in this book he describes having an energy-efficient foam and some other personal measures,

22:05.680 --> 22:11.200
and that's about it. While personal choices and living in a way that's more friendly to the

22:11.200 --> 22:16.320
environment can certainly have an impact, a crisis as big as climate change cannot be solved through

22:16.320 --> 22:20.560
people choosing to reduce their personal emissions alone. Huge polluters, such as the

22:20.560 --> 22:25.200
US military or fossil fuel companies, need to be part of the solution too. When it comes to

22:25.200 --> 22:30.800
policy-based initiatives or some kind of collective action to combat something Beck will ostensibly

22:30.800 --> 22:35.760
say is true, he's far less willing and instead talks about how vague and untrustworthy science

22:35.760 --> 22:41.040
can be. What good does Glenn Beck say he believes in climate change do if he's not willing to fight

22:41.040 --> 22:45.760
for it beyond making a few personal concessions? Beck repeated this pattern in his commentary

22:45.760 --> 22:50.160
about the COVID vaccines. Glenn Beck made a tweet about his opinion on the vaccine with this

22:50.160 --> 22:55.680
charming photograph replacing a syringe with a middle finger. People assumed he was an anti-vaxxer,

22:55.680 --> 23:02.960
so he went on Tucker Carlson's show to explain. I too am not anti-vaccine. I had COVID, my wife

23:02.960 --> 23:08.720
had COVID, everybody in my family had it. I'm not going to get a vaccination because I've already

23:08.720 --> 23:15.280
had it. What he's saying here is wrong. You can get COVID more than once, since the antibodies

23:15.280 --> 23:19.600
don't last forever and a vaccine protects you from more serious symptoms. It also offers a

23:19.600 --> 23:24.080
greater degree of protection against new variants. But more broadly, he's using the same tactic he

23:24.080 --> 23:28.320
uses when he's talking about climate change. Make as many reasonable admissions as possible,

23:28.320 --> 23:33.600
push them aside, and then use a bunch of anti-vaxx talking points. And when you make a good case,

23:34.800 --> 23:41.440
then we'll follow. Make the case. But you can't question it. The problem is, even when he admits

23:41.520 --> 23:45.040
to certain parts of the case, his position doesn't change. And if someone's ultimate

23:45.040 --> 23:49.360
position stays the same, and the only change to their arguments is that they're predicated

23:49.360 --> 23:54.240
by some admissions that ultimately don't change them, they're using those admissions to create

23:54.240 --> 23:59.680
the illusion of carefully considering the evidence. An irony here is that in his book, Glenn Beck

23:59.680 --> 24:04.160
wrote, we're spending our time arguing about the efficacy of vaccinations, a question that was

24:04.160 --> 24:09.360
pretty much settled two centuries ago. So did he believe it was settled then and change his mind

24:09.360 --> 24:15.440
in 2021? In 2009, Beck was fear-mongering about vaccines. If you say, don't take the swine flu

24:16.000 --> 24:22.800
vaccination, and then, you know, it turns out that the swine flu, this particular wave is virulent,

24:22.800 --> 24:27.360
and the vaccination would have helped. Well, then, you know, what role did I play in that?

24:28.400 --> 24:34.000
The opposite is true. I say, hey, everybody take the vaccination. And that turns out to be

24:34.000 --> 24:39.600
deadly? What role did I play in that? So he was skeptical of vaccines, then considered them

24:39.600 --> 24:44.560
settled a few years later, and now he's once again skeptical. Some additional context might

24:44.560 --> 24:50.720
help here. In 2009 and in 2021, these two vaccines were being championed by Barack Obama and Joe

24:50.720 --> 24:55.920
Biden. And when we look at that quote from 2018 in Glenn Beck's book, we have to remember that

24:55.920 --> 25:00.800
the vaccine discourse of the time was criticizing Trump for repeating lies about vaccine-causing

25:00.800 --> 25:06.560
autism. In that context, the quote reads less about affirming the effectiveness of vaccines,

25:06.560 --> 25:11.600
and is instead attempting to get the topic of vaccines out of the public discourse. Beck's

25:11.600 --> 25:15.600
support of vaccination changes depending on who he's attacking and who he's trying to defend.

25:15.600 --> 25:19.200
He'll accept the science, if it's the most effective way to provide cover for someone on

25:19.200 --> 25:24.560
the right, and deny it if it's a part of attacking the left. Much like Ben Shapiro, Glenn Beck talks

25:24.560 --> 25:28.960
about the founding fathers in tones that can only be described as religious. He refers to them

25:28.960 --> 25:33.120
revealing an eternal truth. And then there's this line from the book. The Declaration of

25:33.120 --> 25:37.120
Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are the most divinely inspired documents,

25:37.120 --> 25:42.080
perhaps of all time. I should remind you all that Glenn Beck is a Christian, and it's my understanding

25:42.080 --> 25:46.640
that the Bible is pretty important to Christians. But Beck's worldview is probably more accurately

25:46.640 --> 25:51.280
depicted in this painting by John McNaughton. One of the funny things about these books is the

25:51.280 --> 25:55.760
complete lack of awareness that they are one part in a long line of human history, and that eventually

25:55.760 --> 26:00.000
the mightiest empires crumble, and another takes its place. And then they get to pretend that they

26:00.000 --> 26:05.440
are the best there ever was, and ever will be. It happened to the Umayyad Caliphate, the Mongol

26:05.440 --> 26:10.320
Empire, and the British Empire, and it'll likely happen to the American Empire one day too. Unless

26:10.320 --> 26:14.240
we all die before that, of course. The real difficulty with someone who has a religious

26:14.240 --> 26:18.880
devotion to their country is that they're not easily challenged, and worse yet, this devotion

26:18.880 --> 26:24.000
can be used to justify all sorts of horrible things. Both Glenn Beck and Ben Shapiro aggressively

26:24.000 --> 26:28.880
argue for American greatness, its exceptionalism, and would sooner ignore the crimes of history to

26:28.880 --> 26:33.280
bask in that glory. The rigidness to their interpretations of what America even means

26:33.280 --> 26:37.280
is part of the problem. When the American government was committing genocide, enslaving

26:37.280 --> 26:41.840
people, and refusing to acknowledge the rights of women and non-white men, this, politicians of

26:41.840 --> 26:46.800
those days, would argue were an accurate interpretation of the foundy documents. Of course,

26:46.800 --> 26:51.680
many people would disagree with that. The lesson of being open to discussion about interpretation

26:51.680 --> 26:55.920
seems obvious to me, but it doesn't seem to have occurred to either Ben Shapiro or Glenn Beck that

26:55.920 --> 27:00.960
they might be wrong in their interpretation. To them, these are divinely inspired records of

27:00.960 --> 27:05.440
eternal truth. That's not a great way to start the conversation or friendly debate these guys

27:05.440 --> 27:09.680
pretend they want to have, and it's telling that their instructions for getting along with them

27:09.680 --> 27:14.000
is outlining the certain types of debates they are not willing to have. I was going to spend some

27:14.000 --> 27:17.120
time laughing at some of the fails Glenn Beck has throughout his book, but if we're going to laugh

27:17.200 --> 27:23.280
at how dumb a book is, there's far more fertile ground in our next volume. Dave Rubins,

27:23.280 --> 27:28.480
don't burn this book thinking for yourself in an age if unreason, is easily the laziest book of

27:28.480 --> 27:34.000
the three I read. If Ben Shapiro and Glenn Beck are bringing their own brand of American exceptionalism

27:34.000 --> 27:40.080
to the masses, Dave Rubin is the blueprint for how to be fooled by that message. Here's an example of

27:40.080 --> 27:46.400
his prose. The left may no longer be liberal, but you're no longer left out. The rest of the book is

27:46.400 --> 27:51.280
of similar quality. Of course, Rubins' project isn't to create an intellectual framework for

27:51.280 --> 27:56.400
believing something. What he's doing, whether he's aware of this or not, is reinforcing a conservative

27:56.400 --> 28:02.080
worldview built on ideas of American exceptionalism. Here's how he opens a chapter. Allow me to open

28:02.080 --> 28:06.000
this chapter with a statement that's wildly controversial and gulag-worthy hate speech.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.560
America is the greatest country in the history of the world. If you're triggered by this, stop

28:10.560 --> 28:15.440
reading. While the second half of that lesson is solid advice, the rest of it isn't triggering

28:15.440 --> 28:20.400
anybody. At best, you might get an eye roll. But what's important is the title of the chapter

28:20.400 --> 28:25.920
that this little passage opens. Stop hating straight white men, America, and Western values.

28:25.920 --> 28:30.880
Rubin is light on details about what Western values mean, and with regard to hating America,

28:30.880 --> 28:36.080
he references some celebrities but doesn't go into detail about how or why they hate America.

28:36.720 --> 28:41.280
As for not hating straight white men, it's an example of how he appeals to identity throughout

28:41.280 --> 28:46.240
this book. Although he claims he's doing it ironically, Dave Rubin is constantly talking

28:46.240 --> 28:50.320
about people's identities in his book. If someone makes a point he agrees with, he has to let you

28:50.320 --> 28:54.320
know that he agrees with them even though they're a cis white male, and if he disagrees, he has to

28:54.320 --> 28:59.200
make a comment about how it's not because they're a woman. Maybe he's just running this particular

28:59.200 --> 29:04.480
attempt at a joke into the ground, but even if he's emphasizing everyone's identity for supposedly

29:04.480 --> 29:09.120
a laugh, how many times does he have to do it until we can safely wonder if he's genuinely

29:09.120 --> 29:14.000
obsessed with identity politics? It reminds me of someone who says they ironically enjoy a song

29:14.000 --> 29:18.640
and are constantly singing or talking about it. At what point does that irony bleed into real

29:18.640 --> 29:24.560
obsession? And sometimes he does the identity shtick in a more nefarious way. One anecdote Rubin

29:24.560 --> 29:29.440
brings up is how at one of his live shows he was confronted by an audience member who was a genuine

29:29.440 --> 29:35.040
Nazi. Rubin then put this Nazi first in line for the Q&A session so they could have a debate about

29:35.040 --> 29:39.440
whether the Holocaust happened. In this discussion, most of the heavy lifting seems to have been done

29:39.440 --> 29:44.080
by Rubin's guest, Michael Shermer, though Rubin pats them both on the back for the civilized debate

29:44.080 --> 29:49.360
about whether or not this obvious historical fact occurred with a bigoted conspiracy theorist.

29:49.360 --> 29:54.160
At no point does Rubin wonder how a Nazi showed up in his audience, and he doesn't explain why he

29:54.160 --> 29:58.320
would choose to debate a Nazi instead of, say, someone on the left who might have been there,

29:58.320 --> 30:02.960
assuming there was anyone from the left at this particular performance. But the truly sinister

30:02.960 --> 30:07.760
part is the paragraph he uses to close the anecdote. One final note on this, it turned out

30:07.760 --> 30:13.040
that the Holocaust-denied woman was transgender. Yes, that's right, a trans Holocaust denier.

30:13.040 --> 30:18.880
Do with that what you will. What exactly does Rubin expect anyone to do with that? Personally,

30:18.880 --> 30:23.040
it means nothing to me. Being trans doesn't disqualify someone from being a hateful conspiracy

30:23.040 --> 30:28.160
theorist, but to an anti-trans bigot, it would be a helpful anecdote to push their own agenda

30:28.160 --> 30:33.280
of discriminating against trans people, presenting them as mentally unbalanced. Rubin must know who

30:33.280 --> 30:37.520
he's serving by bringing up such a meaningless fact. Here's another example of Rubin being

30:37.520 --> 30:43.040
completely ridiculous. First of all, no. We're not an imperialist country. The United States

30:43.040 --> 30:48.800
was literally founded on a pushback against imperialism. If I may have my own, first of all,

30:48.800 --> 30:54.400
I wouldn't reduce the Revolutionary War to a pushback. And second, how can he possibly be

30:54.400 --> 30:59.200
this naive? I would think any political commentator would have some awareness of

30:59.200 --> 31:04.560
American hegemonic influence around the world. There are American military bases in over 70

31:04.560 --> 31:09.360
countries and territories. The U.S. exerts its influence everywhere. But since it doesn't fit

31:09.360 --> 31:14.080
the definition of an imperial power from centuries past, Rubin washes his hands of understanding the

31:14.080 --> 31:18.160
tremendous influence the United States has over many parts of the world, and how that might fit

31:18.160 --> 31:23.360
the definition of imperial. But it's not surprising he doesn't know or bother to know any of that.

31:23.360 --> 31:29.280
Because as I mentioned earlier, the one word that captures this book so well is lazy. Rubin

31:29.280 --> 31:34.240
brings up a number of different topics, sometimes more than once, and often has little to nothing

31:34.240 --> 31:39.840
of value to say about them. At one point in the book, he copies and pastes three pages of supposed

31:39.840 --> 31:45.360
facts from PragerU. When he tries to do his own version of Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life,

31:45.360 --> 31:49.680
he can't even think of 12 and only writes six. In the section where he cites his sources,

31:49.680 --> 31:54.080
he can barely fill three pages. Rubin's final message for the reader, one that

31:54.080 --> 31:58.480
encapsulates his political philosophy, is to go out there and live your life and ignore all the

31:58.480 --> 32:03.760
nonsense. Yes, his version of activism is to chill out and enjoy life. While I fully support Dave

32:03.760 --> 32:08.400
Rubin, or anyone who finds him insightful, to disengage with the political process, he must

32:08.400 --> 32:12.960
realize how his final message is the antithesis of a call to action that a political commentator

32:12.960 --> 32:18.000
would typically make. Dave Rubin is the rube Ben Shapiro and Glenn Beck are selling their American

32:18.000 --> 32:22.080
exceptionalism narrative to, someone who will unthinkingly accept the mythology of American

32:22.080 --> 32:25.920
greatness and then completely disengage from the political process, because there's no reason to

32:25.920 --> 32:30.400
improve on something that's already great. Unless it's to complain about identity politics. While

32:30.400 --> 32:35.040
tacitly endorsing bigotry, of course. The danger of this type of lazy patriotism is that it can

32:35.040 --> 32:40.000
be used to maintain a bad status quo, or be used as a cover for the far right to bring in fascism

32:40.000 --> 32:44.960
under the cloak of patriotism, reducing a country to facet out principles devoid of interpretation

32:44.960 --> 32:49.920
or nuance, and then insisting everyone prostrate themselves by proclaiming an overwhelming love of

32:49.920 --> 32:55.360
the nation via symbols like the anthem and flag, turns political participation into a sporting

32:55.360 --> 33:00.080
event. It's not about making society better, it's about cheering for the home team. And these books

33:00.080 --> 33:03.840
aren't weighty discussions of politics, they're a merch to buy to show your support for the team

33:03.840 --> 33:08.720
you're backing. That is, if anyone is buying these at all. Books by conservative pundits and

33:08.720 --> 33:13.840
politicians regularly appear on the New York Times bestseller list, only with a small caveat

33:13.840 --> 33:18.080
in the shape of a dagger that appears next to them. Here's the New York Times' explanation.

33:18.080 --> 33:23.200
A dagger indicates that some retailers report receiving bulk orders. While not every book by a

33:23.200 --> 33:27.840
conservative pundit has one of these symbols next to it, a large number do. In fact, while looking

33:27.840 --> 33:32.400
through the hardcover non-fiction list, the dagger symbol almost only comes up for books written by

33:32.400 --> 33:36.800
conservative pundits or politicians. In the case of all three books I mentioned in this video,

33:36.800 --> 33:40.880
they debuted on the list with daggers, indicating bulk purchases, and were on the bestseller list

33:40.880 --> 33:46.480
for, at most, three weeks. This isn't exactly a new finding, as it was detailed in an op-ed

33:46.480 --> 33:50.400
written for The Hill referencing a well-known example of Donald Trump's book Triggered,

33:50.400 --> 33:55.840
which reached number one on the list thanks to a $94,800 purchase from the Republican National

33:55.840 --> 34:00.480
Committee. A Vox article describes how appearing on the list can boost sales on average from 13 to

34:00.480 --> 34:06.720
14% or up to 57% for new authors. It also bestows credibility and potentially a higher advance on

34:06.720 --> 34:11.600
future books. An article in Vanity Fair also noted that the former president's son is hardly

34:11.600 --> 34:16.160
the only one benefiting from these bulk purchases. The National Republican Congressional Committee

34:16.160 --> 34:22.240
spent nearly $400,000 on bulk purchases, notably spending nearly $100,000 buying copies of Dan

34:22.240 --> 34:28.720
Crenshaw's Fortitude. In 2015, Ted Cruz used $300,000 in campaign funds to buy copies of one

34:28.720 --> 34:33.360
of his books, A Time for Truth. It's easier to track down the bulk sales of politicians because

34:33.360 --> 34:38.880
groups like the RNC and NRCC need to publicly report their spending. When it comes to pundits,

34:38.880 --> 34:44.000
like the authors highlighted in this video, it gets murkier. Some hypotheses have been floated,

34:44.000 --> 34:48.320
such as bulk purchases being demanded ahead of speaking engagements or book signings.

34:48.320 --> 34:52.400
It's hard to say exactly, and it's not as though people don't purchase books by conservative

34:52.400 --> 34:57.280
pundits. Bill O'Reilly has had plenty of success killing anything with a pulse, but his books tend

34:57.280 --> 35:01.840
to stay on the bestseller lists for months at a time, which seems to reflect a genuine interest

35:01.840 --> 35:06.000
in his work. These other authors, at least the ones I've covered in this video, don't have

35:06.000 --> 35:10.720
nearly the staying power. It reveals a lack of genuine demand for these titles, outside of,

35:10.720 --> 35:16.720
perhaps, a select devoted few. So devoted that apparently they all engage in bulk purchases.

35:16.720 --> 35:21.440
And I don't blame the wider reading public for not caring. These are terrible books. The Dave

35:21.440 --> 35:25.600
Rubin one in particular would be more readable after using it as toilet paper, and the other

35:25.600 --> 35:30.160
two are little more than poor arguments for American exceptionalism. Assuming someone really

35:30.160 --> 35:35.040
is buying these, they would make solid additions to one of the worst libraries of books to ever be

35:35.040 --> 35:41.200
created. So what can we possibly take away from this discussion of three random conservative

35:41.200 --> 35:46.960
non-fiction titles? They seem to be a blueprint on how to disengage with the political process.

35:47.600 --> 35:53.200
To accept that America is great and that anyone trying to change it is actually time to destroy

35:53.200 --> 35:57.520
America. That politics are something we don't need to get particularly passionate about.

35:57.520 --> 36:01.920
It's best to just disengage and remove yourself from the political process,

36:01.920 --> 36:07.200
and let the status quo rumble on completely indifferent to their real world struggle.

36:10.160 --> 36:14.720
