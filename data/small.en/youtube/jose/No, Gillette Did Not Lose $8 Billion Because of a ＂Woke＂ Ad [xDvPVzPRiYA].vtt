00:00.000 --> 00:03.360
My sponsor for this video is not Gillette and their razors suck.

00:10.960 --> 00:14.320
In January of 2019, Gillette released an ad titled,

00:14.320 --> 00:21.120
We Believe The Best Men Can Be Gillette short film about the danger of toxic masculinity.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.120
And to sell razors, of course.

00:23.120 --> 00:28.640
In some corners of the internet, this was taken as a direct assault on men and masculinity,

00:28.640 --> 00:32.320
and the outrage helped fuel this ad to reach millions of viewers.

00:32.320 --> 00:37.280
The story of using socially progressive messaging in advertising has already been told in a great

00:37.280 --> 00:41.760
video by Hbomberguy. You can go watch that if you want a bit more detail on how these companies

00:41.760 --> 00:46.160
use these methods to sell their products. This video isn't about that, though. It's about what

00:46.160 --> 00:52.960
happened with the Gillette outrage a few months later. In July of 2019, Procter & Gamble, Gillette's

00:52.960 --> 00:57.040
parent company, announced in its fourth quarter earnings report that it was writing down the

00:57.040 --> 01:03.200
value of its Gillette assets by $8 billion. The reaction from the outrage mob was predictable,

01:03.200 --> 01:07.440
lots of crowing and patting themselves on the back, and people were hurriedly adding

01:07.440 --> 01:12.640
yet another entry to the spurious list of things that went woke and got broke.

01:12.640 --> 01:17.680
Which is still ridiculous, because this write-down has nothing to do with the ad in question.

01:17.680 --> 01:21.760
One of the common misconceptions about this $8 billion loss is that it reflects a dramatic

01:21.760 --> 01:26.640
drop in sales of Gillette products. A quick look at the sales figures tells us this is impossible.

01:26.640 --> 01:31.360
Gillette is part of Procter & Gamble's grooming division, a division that, in all of its 2019

01:31.360 --> 01:38.320
fiscal year, had sales of $6.2 billion, roughly a 5% drop from last year's $6.6 billion. So,

01:38.320 --> 01:42.880
obviously, that's not a drop of $8 billion. And even though the ad came out in January,

01:42.880 --> 01:48.800
Procter & Gamble's fiscal year actually ends in June, so it would only have about five months of

01:48.800 --> 01:55.040
sales to lose $8 billion. This write-down wasn't about millions of people leaving the Gillette brand

01:55.040 --> 01:59.760
en masse. Unlike certain critics, let's actually read the whole article to get a better understanding

01:59.760 --> 02:04.880
of what happened here. It quite clearly calls this $8 billion write-down. This is when a company

02:04.880 --> 02:09.840
looks at the assets it has and lowers their value based on demand in the market. Here's a small

02:09.840 --> 02:16.000
example to explain that. Let's say we have a piece of clothing such as jorts, and you're a company

02:16.000 --> 02:20.640
that has a warehouse full of jorts in the midst of a jorts craze sweeping the world. You would

02:20.640 --> 02:25.440
record that stash of jorts as an asset in your books, and you'd value it based on the high price

02:25.440 --> 02:31.600
people are currently paying for jorts. As time goes by, humanity comes to its senses and realizes

02:31.600 --> 02:36.880
that jorts are, in fact, ugly clothing no sane person would wear. As demand goes down, the average

02:36.880 --> 02:41.120
price for jorts goes down with it, and that warehouse full of jorts you have is now worth

02:41.120 --> 02:46.640
substantially less. While the physical asset of jorts remains completely unchanged throughout

02:46.640 --> 02:51.200
this time period, their value in the marketplace has gone down, and a responsible company would

02:51.200 --> 02:55.920
need to update this value in its books by writing it down. And we're seeing something similar happen

02:55.920 --> 03:01.680
here with razors. Although razor technology hasn't changed dramatically, it's men's fashion that has

03:01.680 --> 03:06.400
been changing over the last decade, and beards are very fashionable these days. Less guys shaving

03:06.400 --> 03:11.520
means less guys are buying razors. There's also the fact that the population, at least in the

03:11.520 --> 03:16.320
United States, and older men generally don't shave themselves as frequently as younger men.

03:16.320 --> 03:20.480
Add into the fact that Gillette, which once had very little in the way of competition, is now

03:20.480 --> 03:24.880
facing some serious resistance from companies like Harry's and Dollar Shave Club. Suddenly,

03:24.880 --> 03:28.720
you've got a brand that's having a much tougher time sell in its products, and Gillette's sales

03:28.720 --> 03:33.440
over the past decade reflect that, showing a steady decline in year-over-year sales. Proctor

03:33.440 --> 03:37.680
and Gamble also reported that its global sales are less profitable due to currency fluctuations

03:37.680 --> 03:42.800
around the world. That's a whole other topic in finance that I'm even less qualified to speak about.

03:43.280 --> 03:47.600
The point is that Gillette's trouble as a brand had been well known for some time. Here's an article

03:47.600 --> 03:53.280
from back in 2017 demonstrating that Gillette as a brand was having a tough time. Let's keep one

03:53.280 --> 03:57.840
thing straight though. Gillette still has a massive mortgage share. There are a lot of different

03:57.840 --> 04:03.360
estimates of this, but I've seen numbers from everywhere between 50 to 60%, but that's a far

04:03.360 --> 04:09.360
cry from the 70% at once claim. It means that this incredibly profitable business is now only

04:09.360 --> 04:13.600
fairly profitable. It stands to reason that a brand that doesn't make as much money as it used

04:13.600 --> 04:18.400
to isn't going to be worth as much in the marketplace. Proctor and Gamble purchased Gillette

04:18.400 --> 04:25.600
in 2005 for the enormous sum of $57 billion, and while Gillette showed strong growth in the years

04:25.600 --> 04:31.600
that followed, in the early 2010s it demonstrated a sizable decline, meaning if Proctor and Gamble

04:31.600 --> 04:36.160
were to try and sell Gillette on the market today, it's quite likely it wouldn't fetch quite as high

04:36.160 --> 04:41.040
a price. A write-down is an accounting technique used to reflect this new reality. It also lets

04:41.040 --> 04:45.760
the parent company, in this case Proctor and Gamble, lower its tax burden. If it's reporting

04:45.760 --> 04:50.400
to its government that its assets are worth $8 billion less than previously reported, that's

04:50.400 --> 04:54.720
$8 billion they won't have to pay taxes on at the end of the year. The annual earnings report this

04:54.720 --> 04:59.840
was all announced and also announced very strong sales and overall growth for the Proctor and Gamble

04:59.840 --> 05:04.640
company. So when this news went public, the market, being aware of how all this works,

05:04.640 --> 05:09.280
wasn't dissuaded by the write-down and instead focused on the strong sales growth, decided to

05:09.280 --> 05:14.720
buy up shares of Proctor and Gamble and sent the stock to a record high. This, obviously, flies in

05:14.720 --> 05:19.360
the face of the idea that a commercial about toxic masculinity ruined Gillette and cost them

05:19.360 --> 05:24.320
$8 billion. Not that right-wing media outlets let it stop them from running countless stories about

05:24.320 --> 05:29.920
just that. My absolute favorite comes from the Washington Examiner, which originally ran an

05:29.920 --> 05:36.880
article with a headline reading, Gillette CEO, $8 billion loss is price worth pain over hashtag

05:36.880 --> 05:43.040
me too campaign, which would later be updated with this correction. Correction. The Washington

05:43.040 --> 05:47.680
Examiner has updated the story to remove the suggestion that Gillette lost $8 billion due to

05:47.680 --> 05:52.480
its me too inspired advertising campaign. We regret that this article did not adhere to the

05:52.480 --> 05:57.280
Washington Examiner's normal standards and procedures and the headline had to be changed to

05:57.280 --> 06:04.240
Gillette CEO losing customers over hashtag me too campaign is price worth pain. How many customers

06:04.240 --> 06:09.680
were lost? Did it have a meaningful impact? This article can't really tell us and that's kind of

06:09.680 --> 06:16.000
the point. It's just a bunch of noise. But did this ad actually have an impact? I want to look

06:16.000 --> 06:21.040
at the sales numbers one more time. In this annual data, we can see sales for Gillette have been going

06:21.040 --> 06:25.440
down for a long time. The last eight years in particular have not been kinds of the brand.

06:25.440 --> 06:31.680
And when did this commercial debut? Right about here. When trying to measure the value of the

06:31.680 --> 06:36.240
Gillette brand and its associated assets, one of the key metrics is going to be how much it earns

06:36.240 --> 06:40.960
via sales. And if poor sales are responsible for lowering its value, this has been a problem long

06:40.960 --> 06:45.920
before the ad about toxic masculinity. You could argue that unlike Nike, this ad didn't do much

06:45.920 --> 06:51.040
to help Gillette. And that seems like a fair assessment. It's not like this ad and the media

06:51.040 --> 06:55.120
storm that followed really turned the brand's fortunes around. There's all sorts of reasons

06:55.120 --> 06:58.800
why this could be true. People are probably more likely to make a political statement through

06:58.800 --> 07:02.960
their fashion choices rather than through whatever grooming products they have in their washroom.

07:02.960 --> 07:07.440
But the argument that being woke destroyed Gillette's business, especially when it still

07:07.440 --> 07:11.840
makes over six billion dollars a year, isn't anywhere close to true. And with that, we can

07:11.840 --> 07:16.720
put this story to bed. Another bad argument in the long line of trash fire arguments about

07:16.720 --> 07:22.960
getting woke and going broke. So why the hell am I talking about a story that's nearly a year old?

07:23.520 --> 07:29.280
One of my most downvoted videos is why get woke, go broke is a lie. While I'd like to think it's

07:29.280 --> 07:34.400
because the title should obviously have been get woke, go broke is a joke, the truth is,

07:34.400 --> 07:40.080
according to the comments, that I was avoiding the much stronger examples of how inserting woke

07:40.080 --> 07:46.080
politics into anything turns off a mainstream audience. Chief among those examples is the Gillette

07:46.080 --> 07:50.560
eight billion dollar loss, which dribbles into the comments section of that video on a regular

07:50.560 --> 07:55.360
basis. I always found it strange that I kept seeing these comments and obviously false story

07:55.360 --> 08:00.400
about a single ad costing a company eight billion dollars should make someone skeptical or at least

08:00.400 --> 08:05.120
raise some alarms. That's obviously a sensational story. Even if you're someone inclined to believe

08:05.120 --> 08:10.160
the whole get woke, go broke thing, this should still make you pause. Doesn't it seem a little

08:10.160 --> 08:15.520
far fetched? I think what we need to consider is that when people spread this talking point,

08:15.520 --> 08:19.440
they aren't trying to demonstrate their knowledge of a subject, but rather their membership in a

08:19.440 --> 08:24.960
group. In recent years, psychologists have been anxiously studying the expansion of fake news

08:24.960 --> 08:29.760
ever since social media started becoming such a pervasive spreader of it. Recent research shows

08:29.760 --> 08:34.480
us quite depressingly that false news not only spreads widely on the internet, it also spreads

08:34.480 --> 08:39.360
much quicker than real news. This is especially true for anything considered political. According

08:39.360 --> 08:44.240
to a review of the research published by the American Psychological Association, facts tend

08:44.240 --> 08:48.240
to be spread by partisans on the left and the right at the same rate, regardless of whether or

08:48.240 --> 08:52.720
not that information is true. Part of the reason this information is spread on social media

08:52.720 --> 08:57.440
is not the desire to inform our contemporaries, but to signal that we are, in fact, part of the

08:57.440 --> 09:02.560
same political group. Daniel Kahane, a professor of law and psychology at Yale Law School, offers

09:02.560 --> 09:07.280
some insight using the politically contentious topic of climate change. If you take an ordinary

09:07.280 --> 09:12.080
member of the public, his or her carbon footprint is too small to make an effect on climate change.

09:12.080 --> 09:16.800
If they make a mistake on the science in that part of their life, nothing bad happens to them,

09:16.800 --> 09:21.360
but they can be adversely affected if they're holding a deviant view on an identity-defining

09:21.360 --> 09:26.720
issue inside their social group. In other words, when someone shows up to my comments section to

09:26.720 --> 09:30.880
mention a talking point that never had any way behind it, they aren't honestly hoping to change

09:30.880 --> 09:35.360
my mind. They're just letting me and any other commenters know that they belong to a certain

09:35.360 --> 09:40.880
political group, one that opposes the group I represent. And when watching some of the videos

09:40.880 --> 09:45.360
on YouTube pushing narratives like Get Woke Go Broke that have a tenuous connection to any sort

09:45.360 --> 09:49.760
of evidence, you can see how they're constructed not to provide greater context or understanding,

09:49.760 --> 09:54.160
but instead taking a news story and placing it into a more exciting narrative,

09:54.160 --> 09:58.400
one that binds its audience together. They're going there to have their opinions reinforced,

09:58.400 --> 10:02.880
and to see other people in the comments section or on Twitter who feel the exact same way that

10:02.880 --> 10:06.640
they do. They may go on to other social media platforms where they continue to signal to one

10:06.640 --> 10:10.880
another that they're in the same social circle. No one really understands anything that they're

10:10.880 --> 10:16.240
talking about, but they've at least identified their compatriots, their friends, their community.

10:16.240 --> 10:20.000
And that's what this is all about. It's about building communities and making friends. And on

10:20.000 --> 10:24.240
its face, that's a lovely thing. Making friends and building a community is something everyone

10:24.240 --> 10:29.360
wants and I generally recommend. But where it goes wrong is when it's centered around blindly

10:29.360 --> 10:34.080
following someone who's deeply ignorant of politics, or worse yet, misrepresenting the

10:34.080 --> 10:38.880
news of the day to advance a toxic political agenda. Some of the most successful YouTube

10:38.880 --> 10:43.520
and Twitch channels are built on this idea of community, and some creators use that language

10:43.520 --> 10:48.160
quite openly. There's nothing inherently wrong with it, but what I would hope that you as a viewer

10:48.160 --> 10:52.640
do is take some time to consider what positions are required to be a member of that community

10:52.640 --> 10:57.120
and what cost is associated with ignoring them. And then ask yourself, have I really thought about

10:57.120 --> 11:01.920
this? Have I spent the time really digging into and trying to understand these issues that are

11:01.920 --> 11:07.920
apparently central to my social circle that I'm now a part of? And that's true of commentary

11:08.000 --> 11:12.160
channels on the right and left. A recent piece of research to come out of the University of

11:12.160 --> 11:17.200
Regina in Saskatchewan, Canada argued that it isn't political affiliation alone that's to blame

11:17.200 --> 11:21.280
for the spread of fake news on the internet. Researchers argue that it's actually a case of

11:21.280 --> 11:25.520
lazy thinking, and that when people think more critically about the news they're seeing,

11:25.520 --> 11:30.720
they're less likely to engage with the spread of fake news, regardless of the political affiliation.

11:30.720 --> 11:37.120
David Rand, PhD, Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT, explains.

11:37.200 --> 11:41.920
Our findings suggest that getting people to reason more is a good thing. When you're on social media,

11:41.920 --> 11:47.280
stop and think. So the next time you're on social media and you see a sensational news story,

11:47.280 --> 11:51.120
especially when you're inclined to agree with, take some time to think about it before rushing

11:51.120 --> 11:55.120
to share it with your friends. It's probably too much to expect this one video to change someone's

11:55.120 --> 11:59.200
deeply held political beliefs, but I hope anyone watching will at least be less willing to spread

11:59.200 --> 12:03.680
bogus news stories in an effort to take the other side down a peg. And when it comes to your own

12:03.680 --> 12:09.360
personal beliefs and the arguments that sustain them, never be afraid of an honest challenge or

12:09.360 --> 12:14.240
conversation or debate. At the end of the day, you'll either make your existing beliefs stronger

12:14.240 --> 12:18.640
or you'll be able to adopt something that's better and more accurately reflects the truth.

12:18.640 --> 12:22.080
And if you're in one of those communities where you have to believe something that's either

12:22.080 --> 12:28.080
obviously not true or can only be believed if you refuse to actually engage with evidence or facts,

12:28.080 --> 12:30.800
maybe consider that this group isn't the one for you.

12:30.800 --> 12:37.040
For the longest time, I've been meaning to make a video about how to disagree

12:37.040 --> 12:43.120
amongst our own side, that is to say, within the left. I'm a very big believer that debate

12:43.120 --> 12:48.720
and conversation, and when I say debate, I don't necessarily mean live debates, which

12:48.720 --> 12:52.320
often feel more like theater than anything else. Not that there's anything wrong with theater,

12:52.320 --> 12:56.640
of course. Theater is a lovely and sometimes necessary thing. But I think it's very important

12:56.640 --> 13:01.840
that we create a space where we feel free to debate and discuss our ideas in a way to make

13:01.840 --> 13:06.480
them better, stronger and more resistant to challenge from parties who we may find ourselves

13:06.480 --> 13:12.480
at odds with politically. Sometimes that means ideas we have aren't great. They need to grow,

13:12.480 --> 13:17.280
evolve, or sometimes they need to be dropped entirely depending on the arguments involved.

13:17.280 --> 13:20.960
Sometimes we might need to bring them back if there's some new argument is brought for them.

13:20.960 --> 13:26.000
That's one of the lovely things about discussion and discourse. And when I say debate, I'm talking

13:26.000 --> 13:32.400
about real issues, not stuff like let's talk about, like climate change, as if that's not

13:32.400 --> 13:36.800
an obvious scientific reality. This video initially wasn't supposed to be about any of that,

13:36.800 --> 13:40.720
but the Gillette thing, it just really bugged me and I wanted to talk about it. Not because I

13:40.720 --> 13:45.360
care about Proctor and Gamble and Gillette. I actually don't like them at all. I don't use

13:45.360 --> 13:50.560
the razors usually. And I think they're pretty bad and overpriced. If you take anything away

13:50.560 --> 13:55.520
from the Gillette section of this video, it's just don't buy their products or do. I don't care.
