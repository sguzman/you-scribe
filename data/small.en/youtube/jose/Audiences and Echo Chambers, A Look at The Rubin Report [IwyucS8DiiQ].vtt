00:00.000 --> 00:05.440
Let me first get something out of the way. This video is not going to be a takedown or

00:05.440 --> 00:11.120
demolition of Dave Rubin. Ideally, Dave Rubin could watch this video himself and understand

00:11.120 --> 00:15.520
a carefully constructed critique when he sees it. But in the land of the internet,

00:15.520 --> 00:18.080
that might be asking for far too much.

00:23.360 --> 00:28.240
Dave Rubin began his career as a bushy-tailed comedian performing in New York City. His early

00:28.240 --> 00:32.320
career had him immediately touching on the world of political comedy when he interned

00:32.320 --> 00:38.320
at The Daily Show. Rubin displayed some affinity towards creating his own platforms by starting

00:38.320 --> 00:44.640
The Anti-Show, a short-lived comedy program filmed at NBC Studios that aired on Manhattan

00:44.640 --> 00:50.640
Neighborhood Network in the fall of 2001. It was basically a daily show rip-off that

00:50.640 --> 00:55.840
never really got off the ground. Speaking of not getting off the ground, Rubin also started two

00:55.840 --> 01:02.000
different comedy clubs in New York City in the mid-2000s. The first, Joe Franklin's Comedy Club,

01:02.000 --> 01:08.080
closed some time after 2009. I couldn't quite find the exact date on that one. And the second

01:08.080 --> 01:13.680
club, I couldn't really find any information at all. The comedy company closed down, but its

01:13.680 --> 01:20.000
former address is now occupied by a TGI Friday's, so at least it went out with a laugh. Rubin went

01:20.000 --> 01:24.960
on to start several podcasts including Hot Gay Comics and The Ben and Dave Show, both of which

01:24.960 --> 01:31.200
ended up being TV shows on the Here Network. But it was Rubin's The Six Pack, which was eventually

01:31.200 --> 01:36.320
picked up by Sirius, that became a big hit. Rubin gave up the podcasting world and eventually moved

01:36.320 --> 01:41.200
to Los Angeles where he began working at the progressive YouTube channel The Young Turks,

01:41.200 --> 01:46.960
and so the Rubin Report was born. However, this was a far cry from the show we know of today.

01:46.960 --> 01:53.280
It consisted of short clips touching on news stories of the day with Rubin's brand of humor thrown in.

01:53.280 --> 01:57.920
Rubin also made the occasional appearance on cable news programs such as The O'Reilly Factor.

01:57.920 --> 02:02.960
Here he is briefly commenting on what would later be a major cause for him. On the base of this,

02:02.960 --> 02:08.240
I believe in free speech and I believe that Dan Cathy is welcome to say what he wants. And I

02:08.240 --> 02:13.280
believe that the gay community at the same point is welcome to say what they want. Rubin eventually

02:13.280 --> 02:19.200
broke with The Young Turks during what he would later refer to as his awakening. It began in

02:19.280 --> 02:25.760
October of 2014 when Rubin saw the infamous confrontation between Sam Harris and Batman

02:25.760 --> 02:30.000
on Real Time with Bill Maher, where some noise was made after Sam Harris called Islam,

02:33.520 --> 02:39.680
some heated words were exchanged, and a wide-eyed Dave Rubin was sent on a voyage of self-discovery.

02:39.680 --> 02:43.360
It was a voyage that he was on with a lot of other people who were regular viewers of

02:43.360 --> 02:48.960
Rubin's current employer, The Young Turks. Shortly after the real-time confrontation,

02:48.960 --> 02:53.600
Sam Harris sat down with Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks for a three-hour discussion. Although the

02:53.600 --> 02:59.200
discussion was less a debate and more an exercise in masochism, Rubin, and many of the viewers,

02:59.200 --> 03:04.560
felt some affinity with Harris's exasperation with the left. Rubin felt that exasperation so

03:04.560 --> 03:09.200
strongly that he decided to break from The Young Turks and immediately take the Rubin report into

03:09.200 --> 03:15.680
his own hands. And by immediately into his own hands, I mean taking a job with Riot five months

03:15.680 --> 03:36.400
later. Although recently, most of TYT's audience tends to generally enjoy the content they put out,

03:36.400 --> 03:43.280
there was a period around 2014 and 2015 where whenever there was any mention of Islam or a few

03:43.280 --> 03:47.520
other hot-button topics in one of their videos, there would be an intense negative reaction.

03:48.080 --> 03:53.360
Here's an illustrative comment. A significant segment of TYT's audience had strongly held

03:53.360 --> 03:59.360
beliefs about Islam, feminism, and race, and they strongly disagreed with TYT's coverage of those

03:59.360 --> 04:04.400
issues. This resentment towards discussion centered on identity politics was creating

04:04.400 --> 04:09.520
a growing sense of outrage from those who thought the accusations of racism and sexism were getting

04:09.520 --> 04:15.200
out of hand. This anger was coalescing into a general anti-left sentiment and can be seen in

04:15.200 --> 04:20.480
comments like the ones on screen. The mere mention of terms like racism and sexism were enough to

04:20.480 --> 04:25.680
trigger an outrage. While I don't speak to the personal motivations of those who share this anger,

04:25.680 --> 04:30.880
it is one that can be found quite easily throughout YouTube, particularly in circles that disseminate

04:30.880 --> 04:35.360
videos in which there is much gnashing of teeth about the SJW menace.

04:36.240 --> 04:41.840
Ruben's YouTube career up to this point had mostly been mixed. His videos while working

04:41.840 --> 04:48.320
under the Young Turks varied widely in their results. Some struggled to crack 10,000 viewers

04:48.320 --> 04:54.480
while others reached millions. His time at Riot gave him some consistency but in the wrong

04:54.480 --> 05:00.160
direction, with most videos struggling to break that 10,000 view barrier. Much of the content of

05:00.160 --> 05:05.920
this time followed Ruben's earlier formula of commenting on News of the Day. Yes robots are

05:05.920 --> 05:10.240
coming to destroy this and that's why I do it so that years from now on a cracked tv screen in a

05:10.240 --> 05:16.480
room after the robotic overtake you'll see this and people go oh he knew what he was saying. But

05:16.480 --> 05:22.240
being his own version of what a channel like TOIT was already doing wasn't cutting it so Ruben made

05:22.240 --> 05:27.920
another change. Ruben's time with Riot came to an end when Ruben made the move to Larry King's Aura

05:27.920 --> 05:33.920
TV in September of 2015. With this came a format change from brief commentary clips to long

05:33.920 --> 05:38.960
one-on-one interviews. Ruben's first major interview just happened to be with the man who

05:38.960 --> 05:45.040
inspired his awakening Sam Harris. The Ruben report we know of today was born during that

05:45.040 --> 05:50.560
interview with Harris as Ruben not only found a format he enjoyed but he also found a particular

05:50.560 --> 05:59.360
audience. One that would shape his show in the years to come. Ruben began his new format by

05:59.360 --> 06:04.240
immediately addressing his audience with a series of rules. You can see them on screen and by and

06:04.240 --> 06:08.960
large they're pretty straightforward for a left-leaning YouTube personality. I say left-leaning

06:08.960 --> 06:14.560
because that's how Ruben describes himself at this point. Is seeing my side the people on the left

06:14.560 --> 06:19.280
cherry picking facts stifling debate and labeling everyone they disagree with a racist, a bigot,

06:19.280 --> 06:24.880
a homophobe or worse. From here we can see Ruben had some ideas of how his show was going to go

06:24.880 --> 06:29.280
down. He was presenting himself not just as a person on the left though but rather someone

06:29.280 --> 06:35.120
disaffected with the left. By choosing Sam Harris as his first interview subject he was courting the

06:35.120 --> 06:39.680
same faction on the left that's dissatisfied with the content on channels like the Young Turks

06:39.680 --> 06:45.280
particularly its commentary on social issues. One of the big promises early on in the Ruben report

06:45.280 --> 06:50.000
was to speak with people from across the political spectrum. Ruben wanted to prove his

06:50.000 --> 06:55.360
earnestness in exploring ideas by inviting a wide range of opinions and this is evidenced by many

06:55.360 --> 07:01.040
of his earliest guests including the likes of Don Lemon, Larry Elder, Jimmy Dore and Douglas Murray.

07:01.040 --> 07:06.080
But it was one guest in particular that really resonated with Ruben's new audience and that was

07:06.080 --> 07:11.360
Milo Yiannopoulos. For those who may not remember Milo Yiannopoulos was a writer for the right-wing

07:11.360 --> 07:16.960
media outlet Breitbart and he shot to fame championing the Gamergate controversy. After

07:16.960 --> 07:22.560
outraging activists on the left for a few years he fell from grace after some old comments of him

07:22.560 --> 07:28.800
came out that sound an awful lot like him defending pedophilia. Now he sells dick pills on crackpot

07:28.800 --> 07:34.800
outlet InfoWars. While the Harris interview did well a few months earlier ratcheting up nearly

07:34.800 --> 07:38.480
one million views at the time of writing this it was several small clips with the

07:38.480 --> 07:43.280
Yiannopoulos that really excited the viewership of Ruben's channel. All three of these videos did

07:43.280 --> 07:48.000
extremely well with the combined total of nearly five million views and leading to a spike in

07:48.000 --> 07:54.000
subscriptions and views for Ruben's channel in October of 2015. I need to talk about Dave Ruben's

07:54.000 --> 07:59.280
interview style for a moment. Ruben describes his own style in one of his early videos. I talked to

07:59.280 --> 08:03.680
Mike Huckabee's campaign manager about gay marriage and she basically just danced around it.

08:03.680 --> 08:08.400
Had I pushed her to the breaking point I probably would have never gotten access to her again

08:08.400 --> 08:12.480
and then word would have traveled fast that I'm someone that they shouldn't talk to. So with that

08:12.480 --> 08:16.800
in mind I tried my best to navigate all the interviews with some basic questions and then

08:16.800 --> 08:21.520
some deeper probing. And this will be a theme in many of his interviews in the future. His approach

08:21.520 --> 08:26.640
is so gentle so concerned with offending his guest that he would sooner let his guests walk

08:26.640 --> 08:31.600
all over him and use his show as a convenient platform rather than strongly counter their

08:31.600 --> 08:38.560
arguments. And that's precisely what Milo Yiannopoulos did. In 2015, Yiannopoulos was a darling

08:38.560 --> 08:42.960
of the alt-right and gamergate crowds and the gentle interview Ruben had with him pleased

08:42.960 --> 08:48.960
Yiannopoulos's fans so much that many of them decided to stick around. While some might argue

08:48.960 --> 08:53.520
the interview helped put Yiannopoulos on the map, I would sooner say that it helped put the new

08:53.520 --> 09:00.560
Ruben report on the map with a particular audience. Ruben had the audience of disaffected leftists

09:00.560 --> 09:05.680
but Yiannopoulos brought with him a bunch of people from the extreme right who came to see someone on

09:05.680 --> 09:11.200
the left play second banana to their idol. It wouldn't be the last time Ruben found himself

09:11.200 --> 09:15.760
in this position. It should also be noted that Yiannopoulos was a guest that was recommended to

09:15.760 --> 09:21.920
Ruben by his audience beforehand and as already evidenced, the disaffected left that was Ruben's

09:21.920 --> 09:27.840
new base enjoyed hearing the likes of Yiannopoulos complain about the SJWs. Ruben's initial audience

09:27.920 --> 09:32.800
were curious about this anti-left rhetoric coming from the right and while they may have seen

09:32.800 --> 09:38.080
themselves as either on the left or center, they were willing to put any disagreements on hold to

09:38.080 --> 09:43.040
enjoy a good bashing of those on the left they disliked. And in time, the lines between these

09:43.040 --> 09:48.560
audiences would only get blurrier. The booking of Yiannopoulos was a small step in what Ruben was

09:48.560 --> 09:53.040
trying to do with his show. He was hoping to engineer an audience that was not only enjoying

09:53.040 --> 09:58.480
his content but also engaged online. There are numerous examples of Ruben encouraging his viewers

09:58.480 --> 10:03.200
to become more engaged on Twitter and to call out misdeeds wherever they saw them, essentially

10:03.200 --> 10:07.440
turning his audience into a group of online activists that the discussions we're having here

10:07.440 --> 10:12.080
on the show as well as the ones that you guys are having on Twitter and YouTube are actually making

10:12.080 --> 10:17.120
a difference. That's the beauty of the internet. You can get issues to actually bubble up until

10:17.120 --> 10:21.840
mainstream takes notice. There's evidence of the awakening that I've been talking about all over

10:21.920 --> 10:26.080
the place right now. The point of all this is that every week, actually every day that I've been

10:26.080 --> 10:30.480
doing this show, I see this movement getting stronger. You guys are not only connecting with

10:30.480 --> 10:35.040
me but with each other. And now when I see the usual regressives spout off their nonsense,

10:35.040 --> 10:41.120
there's an army of people calling them out on it. That is literally as important as anything that I do.

10:41.120 --> 10:45.680
In return, Ruben took booking suggestions and reading advice from his audience.

10:45.680 --> 10:49.040
He wasn't so much the leader of a movement as he was a part of it.

10:49.680 --> 10:54.960
The next indicator of the state of the Ruben Report audience was its reaction to his interview

10:54.960 --> 11:01.600
with civil rights attorney Areva Martin in January of 2016. To date, it is by far his

11:01.600 --> 11:06.960
least popular interview with the full interview in clipped sections, not getting close to 100,000

11:06.960 --> 11:12.400
views. As an unambiguous voice from the left, the Ruben Report's audience decided Martin's

11:12.400 --> 11:18.080
perspective wasn't a part of the battle of ideas that interested them. Of the few that watched the

11:18.080 --> 11:25.120
Martin interview, the reaction was fierce. A large number of dislikes and comments like this one.

11:25.120 --> 11:30.720
In fact, of all of Ruben's full-length feature interviews, this is the only one where the dislikes

11:30.720 --> 11:35.120
don't number the likes. I don't suspect this is because of Ruben's performance.

11:35.920 --> 11:40.400
Although Ruben trumpeted his platform as a place for voices from across the political spectrum,

11:40.400 --> 11:45.120
it appeared as though the Ruben Report's audience was less interested in voices like Martin and more

11:45.120 --> 11:50.080
interested in voices from the right, like Yiannopoulos. The next few months brought with

11:50.080 --> 11:55.920
it feature interviews with Tommy Robinson, Mike Cernovich, Milo Yiannopoulos, again, and perhaps

11:55.920 --> 12:01.680
most notably, Ben Shapiro. Shapiro, editor for the conservative outlet The Daily Wire,

12:01.680 --> 12:06.480
is a fairly prominent conservative voice who is best known for challenging teenagers on Twitter

12:06.480 --> 12:11.520
and breaking them on the wheel of logic. A little under a year after having him on his show,

12:11.520 --> 12:16.880
Dave Ruben would cite Ben Shapiro, along with earlier guests Sam Harris and Larry Elder,

12:16.880 --> 12:21.680
along with future guest Eric Weinstein, as trusted guides to the world of politics.

12:22.560 --> 12:27.840
Even more telling is that interviews with Harris, Elder, and Shapiro go on to be the most popular

12:27.840 --> 12:33.600
on the channel. Ruben's tastes and his audiences were beginning to align. I want to look at this

12:33.600 --> 12:41.040
comment under the first Shapiro interview from Alex Jones. Wait, that can't be right. Oh, well,

12:41.040 --> 12:47.680
damn, maybe it is Alex Jones, shit. Ruben's style is lauded here as presenting ideas an audience

12:47.680 --> 12:52.480
might not be comfortable with, along with some self-congratulations for being willing to listen

12:52.480 --> 12:56.880
to them. This charity and open-mindedness is something that often accompanies many of the

12:56.880 --> 13:01.600
interviews Ruben has with right-wing guests. The same level of charity never seems to meet the

13:01.600 --> 13:07.280
left-wing guests. They're more likely to meet the fate of Areva Martin, either being ignored or

13:07.280 --> 13:12.000
fiercely disagreed with. The Ruben Report is becoming a place welcoming to voices from the

13:12.000 --> 13:17.600
right while shunning voices from the left. But before leaving season one entirely, there are

13:17.600 --> 13:23.200
two curious direct messages I want to point out first. The real threat of a Donald Trump presidency

13:23.200 --> 13:28.960
and how to stop Trump. Of all of Dave Ruben's direct messages, these two have the worst like

13:28.960 --> 13:35.440
to dislike ratio. Aside from Hillary Clinton is the Democratic presidential nominee from later in

13:35.440 --> 13:42.480
the year. Gee, I wonder why that one got so much hate. The Trump videos feature Dave opining the

13:42.480 --> 13:47.360
divisiveness in politics, and he takes the time to criticize the left for the rise of Trump.

13:48.160 --> 13:54.480
Why he doesn't blame the right for the rise of the progressives is a mystery. In spite of the

13:54.480 --> 13:59.440
name of the video, Ruben only offers a mild criticism of Trump instead falling back on a

13:59.440 --> 14:05.680
common talking point of the time of Trump being some kind of unknowable wildcard. Ruben's advice

14:05.680 --> 14:11.200
to stop Trump is less about what to do to stop him and more about what not to do if you want to

14:11.200 --> 14:17.760
stop him. In other words, his advice for stopping Trump is to admonish the left for behaving badly.

14:18.800 --> 14:24.560
This encapsulates what his channel is often about and what binds the Ruben Report's audience

14:24.560 --> 14:31.120
together. Anger towards the left. Ruben in these videos has demonstrated either consciously or

14:31.120 --> 14:36.640
unconsciously that he knows how to tap into that audience, and that makes all commentary either

14:36.640 --> 14:43.680
explicitly or partially anti-left. Or at this point in the Ruben Report, it would still be considered

14:43.680 --> 14:50.160
anti-regressive. The distinction between regressive and left wouldn't fade until sometime later.

14:50.960 --> 14:56.160
To complete his critical look at Trump, Ruben's guest following these two direct messages were

14:56.160 --> 15:02.400
Mike Cernovich, a Trump operative, and Milo Yiannopoulos. He had famously called Trump his

15:02.400 --> 15:09.040
daddy. This comment from a Dale Gribble alias under how to stop Trump sums up a significant

15:09.040 --> 15:14.880
portion of the Ruben Report's audience. Trump is the anti-left candidate they've all been waiting

15:14.880 --> 15:20.080
for. This was the state of affairs of the Ruben Report heading into the relaunch of the show in

15:20.080 --> 15:27.680
June of 2016. The project had rare fruit for Ruben, and he was getting ready to take it to the next level.

15:33.200 --> 15:37.680
At what can be thought of as season two of the Ruben Report, some major changes happened behind

15:37.680 --> 15:42.960
the scenes. Ruben left Aura TV when they decided to move away from YouTube as a platform for its

15:42.960 --> 15:47.680
videos, and Ruben felt like he needed to be loyal to the audience on YouTube he had helped build.

15:48.240 --> 15:53.200
Ruben moved the show from the Aura Studios to his own home. Now Ruben was faced with the new

15:53.200 --> 15:59.760
challenge. He had to finance the whole thing. Enter every YouTuber's favorite crowdfunding platform,

15:59.760 --> 16:06.560
Patreon. As a side note, the Ruben Report's Patreon was actually started in November of 2015,

16:06.560 --> 16:12.320
over half a year earlier. It only had about a few dozen supporters back then though. It didn't

16:12.320 --> 16:17.760
really pick up any momentum until this season two push in July of 2016 where Ruben asked the

16:17.760 --> 16:23.840
Ruben Report audience to dig deep. And dig deep they did with the number of backers jumping up to

16:23.840 --> 16:34.400
$2,354 and Ruben earning $21,402 a month. The audience who had shaped the Ruben Report had

16:34.400 --> 16:39.600
bought in. Dave Ruben had often equated what he did on the show as being just as important as the

16:39.600 --> 16:44.640
activism of the audience. He lavished them with praise for their activity on social media and

16:44.640 --> 16:50.240
sometimes jumped into the middle of Twitter fights himself. Assuming you haven't had an intense

16:50.240 --> 16:54.400
hypnotherapy session to block this out of your memory, you probably remember there was an election

16:54.400 --> 16:59.760
in the fall of 2016. Shortly after Ruben returned from his break, Hillary Clinton was declared the

16:59.760 --> 17:05.520
nominee for the Democratic Party and this direct message is easily his least popular. It can't

17:05.520 --> 17:10.240
really be compared to any direct message he put together for Trump's nomination though as he

17:10.240 --> 17:14.320
never made one of those. But the comments from the Ruben Report's audience make it quite clear who

17:14.320 --> 17:19.920
they prefer in this upcoming race. To cap it off, Ruben's guest following this direct message was

17:19.920 --> 17:26.160
none other than Clinton critic and felon Dinesh D'Souza. The second DM I want to talk about is

17:26.160 --> 17:30.720
Ruben's discussion of the alt-right. Although he doesn't identify with the group himself,

17:31.280 --> 17:37.760
he largely excuses their actions as antics by ironic Nazis. Ruben is very gentle with his

17:37.760 --> 17:42.960
criticism of the alt-right, noting that while real racist and Nazis exist in their ranks,

17:42.960 --> 17:49.920
what the alt-right really is though is a band of meme posters, anime avatars, and Twitter eggs

17:49.920 --> 17:56.160
vying for attention from people in power. They post Nazi memes, racist pictures, and offensive

17:56.160 --> 18:02.400
tweets with the express intent of getting powerful people to react, respond, and thus

18:02.400 --> 18:08.320
amplify their message. They are keyboard warriors and professional trolls trying to get attention

18:08.320 --> 18:14.720
from the sold out and corrupt media and political elite that we have. Some true racists mixed with

18:14.720 --> 18:20.080
a bunch of people who just want to mess with those in power. How many of each of them are there? We

18:20.080 --> 18:27.360
have no idea. What we do know though is that these people wield very little real world power.

18:27.360 --> 18:32.400
He doesn't see the group as completely despicable, and for good measure he blames Hillary Clinton

18:32.400 --> 18:37.280
for their rise. In this instance though, he doesn't try to take the middle route balancing

18:37.280 --> 18:42.960
right and left. He explicitly says he believes the alt-right is better than the regressive left,

18:42.960 --> 18:48.160
and he believes this to be true because of how he's been informed by the Ruben report audience.

18:49.120 --> 18:54.880
Personally, I think that the regressive left is more of a threat to our democracy than the

18:54.880 --> 19:00.880
alt-right. The regressive left with its tactics of stifling debate and silencing critics

19:00.880 --> 19:06.720
has gained mainstream traction in our media and in our universities. These regressive,

19:06.720 --> 19:13.440
not progressive ideas, have become all too common on the left and they've actually given birth

19:13.520 --> 19:18.240
to the natural response, the alt-right. I know this firsthand not only from the emails that you

19:18.240 --> 19:23.760
guys send me, but also from all the students at UCLA who came up to me after my event with Milo

19:23.760 --> 19:28.720
Yiannopoulos a couple months ago to tell me that they're supporting Trump just because they can't

19:28.720 --> 19:35.920
take the culture of fear around speech anymore. In the eye of this storm still exists some people

19:35.920 --> 19:41.200
in the Ruben report audience who don't share these increasingly anti-left views and no trouble when

19:41.200 --> 19:46.480
they see it. A few comments like these pop up on Ruben's videos expressing dismay and concern,

19:46.480 --> 19:52.080
but they become less common as the months drag on. Ruben gives up on being completely independent

19:52.080 --> 19:57.600
as he announces a partnership with Learn Liberty. Learn Liberty is a project by the Institute for

19:57.600 --> 20:02.400
Humane Studies which is notably funded by billionaire Charles Koch, who is by far its

20:02.400 --> 20:16.160
biggest contributor, having from 1999 to 2014 donated $14,963,318. IHS and by extension

20:16.160 --> 20:20.080
Learn Liberty have been pushing forward a libertarian message across a number of projects

20:20.080 --> 20:24.400
over the years, frequently from a right-wing perspective. Their partnership with the Ruben

20:24.400 --> 20:30.560
report is doing much of the same. Although Dave Rubin, as far as I've been able to discover,

20:30.640 --> 20:35.040
has never gone into the specifics of what his partnership with Learn Liberty entails,

20:35.040 --> 20:39.600
we know at least one part of this deal includes having guests selected by Learn Liberty appear

20:39.600 --> 20:44.640
on the Ruben report. This has, in effect, given Learn Liberty some editorial control over the show.

20:45.280 --> 20:49.680
Much like ceding control to the audience, this is another example of Rubin bargaining away

20:49.680 --> 20:55.840
control over the show that bears his name. Now I don't point this out as a direct criticism,

20:55.840 --> 21:00.800
but would rather refer back to Rubin's stated goals in starting this show. He expressed a desire

21:00.800 --> 21:04.960
to speak to people from across the political spectrum, and he's given significant control

21:04.960 --> 21:10.000
over the booking of his show to his audience, which has a strong anti-left bias, and Learn Liberty,

21:10.000 --> 21:16.720
whose libertarian perspective often put it at odds with the left. If Rubin wants balance on his show,

21:16.720 --> 21:22.320
that is, exploring ideas from across the spectrum, it's at this point he should be wondering where

21:22.320 --> 21:27.600
voices from the left will be coming from. And it's from here that the election kicks into high

21:27.600 --> 21:33.600
gear, and we get a barrage of election-themed content. Rubin's commentary about the election,

21:33.600 --> 21:39.440
as is usual for him, takes the center route, advocating for a nonspecific diversity of voices.

21:40.160 --> 21:47.600
He interviews transhumanist candidate Zoltan Istvan. The audience is less interested in this interview,

21:47.600 --> 21:54.640
or most of the alternative voices that don't support an anti-left stance. The Istvan interview

21:54.640 --> 22:00.320
netted less than 100,000 views across all four clips, whereas, at roughly the same time,

22:00.320 --> 22:06.160
the Rubin reportings lapped up an interview with filmmaker Cassie Jay about her sympathetic look

22:06.160 --> 22:12.160
at men's rights activism. In the interest of presenting some concerns from the Rubin Report

22:12.160 --> 22:16.400
channel, though, regarding its view count, I should point out to this comment where it's

22:16.960 --> 22:21.520
suspected or hypothesized by the Rubin Report that view counts aren't being

22:21.520 --> 22:25.680
accurately reported by YouTube, and people are being unsubscribed from the channel.

22:26.480 --> 22:30.960
This is one of many claims that have come from Dave Rubin over the years about YouTube

22:30.960 --> 22:36.080
interfering with his channel, often based on hearsay or random comments from his audience.

22:37.040 --> 22:42.880
I would love to dive into this YouTube conspiracy, but that will have to be a topic for another day.

22:43.520 --> 22:48.160
Rubin's audience continued to make its feelings clear as the 2016 election continued. In an

22:48.160 --> 22:54.160
interview of October of 2016 with scientist and secular activist Lawrence Krauss, a slightly

22:54.160 --> 23:00.000
unfavorably received section criticizing Trump includes this comment. It illustrates so very

23:00.000 --> 23:04.240
clearly what matters more to the Rubin Report audience, whether Clinton or Trump will be more

23:04.320 --> 23:09.680
sensitive to the concerns of, from their perspective, the SJW menace. That's why they

23:09.680 --> 23:14.240
would sooner watch a video about a female filmmaker being red-pilled over a discussion

23:14.240 --> 23:18.720
of alternative candidates, or even the alternative candidates themselves.

23:19.360 --> 23:24.400
Rubin had on a pro-Clinton guest in Hilary Rosen, and the response from the audience was

23:24.400 --> 23:30.400
predictable. A comment like this, while seeming to represent the thirst for diversity within the

23:30.400 --> 23:35.120
Rubin Report audience, is betrayed by the complete disinterest of the majority of the

23:35.120 --> 23:39.680
actual audience. Much like the voices in the audience asking for more left-leaning guests,

23:40.480 --> 23:46.800
this one is a minority within an increasingly anti-left group. As a brief exception,

23:47.440 --> 23:52.000
with some people on the left, such as David Sirota, the Rubin Report audience can be quite

23:52.000 --> 23:57.520
kind if that person is on to criticize the left. So what matters most is not if the guests are

23:57.520 --> 24:03.200
right or left-wing, but will at least pay lip service to anti-left rhetoric. This all

24:03.200 --> 24:08.800
translates to an audience that was overwhelmingly pro-Trump, a candidate who unabashedly appealed

24:08.800 --> 24:13.840
to the American right, and was seen as taking on those bastards on the left. Well, you know,

24:13.840 --> 24:17.440
from his perspective. After the election of Donald Trump,

24:17.440 --> 24:22.160
Dave Rubin was quick to issue a direct message titled, Don't Freak Out About Donald Trump.

24:22.880 --> 24:26.000
This direct message includes Rubin calling Trump's election.

24:26.000 --> 24:30.880
This was a win for us, right? Because if you think about it, the elite, the media, everybody,

24:30.880 --> 24:36.240
the establishment all wanted one thing to happen. And what happened? The people actually use their

24:36.240 --> 24:41.280
voting power to stop that very thing from happening. That's actually beautiful. I think

24:41.280 --> 24:45.120
he's going to have to govern really from the center. And I think that will be really good

24:45.120 --> 24:49.280
for classical liberals, basic liberal people. I think it'll be really good

24:49.280 --> 24:54.000
for mainstream conservatives. And then maybe the people that are better on the fringes of

24:54.000 --> 24:59.600
all of this thing will so slowly be silenced. That's my suspicion at the moment. And maybe

24:59.600 --> 25:03.360
I have a slight sense of what I'm talking about because I kind of saw this whole thing unfolding

25:03.360 --> 25:09.280
the way it did. Although the prediction has fallen on its face, the win comment in particular

25:09.280 --> 25:13.440
is interesting as it perfectly describes what much of the Rubin report audience celebrates

25:13.440 --> 25:19.760
in Trump. And that's a win against the SJW crowd, who at this point are being conflated with the left

25:19.760 --> 25:24.960
in general. When Dave Rubin describes the Democratic Party as being the identity politics driven

25:24.960 --> 25:31.120
Democratic Party. After nominating Hillary Clinton, a woman who has very little support

25:31.120 --> 25:36.960
in more progressive circles, it shows how anti-regressive has really shifted to just being

25:36.960 --> 25:42.240
anti-left. And it shows how Rubin's perspective has shifted quite a bit to the right.

25:43.200 --> 25:48.000
With Rubin's perspective being informed by his audience, it's safe to assume that they're all

25:48.000 --> 25:53.520
on the same page. This is also the direct message where Rubin infamously mentions holding Trump's

25:53.520 --> 26:04.480
feet to the fire. Yeah, another one that didn't age too well. This direct message also preceded

26:04.480 --> 26:08.800
what would become the Rubin report's highest rated full-length feature interview, Rubin's

26:08.880 --> 26:13.840
discussion with Jordan Peterson. This interview I really only mentioned because it's one of our

26:13.840 --> 26:20.560
earliest instances of Peterson crying over a children's cartoon. Most of your viewers will

26:20.560 --> 26:25.760
have watched Pinocchio. Probably. There's a scene in Pinocchio where Geppetta wishes on a star,

26:26.800 --> 26:32.400
right? And what it means is he lifts up his eyes beyond the horizon to something transcendent,

26:32.960 --> 26:37.760
to something ultimate, because that's what a star is. It's part of the of the eternity of the night

26:37.760 --> 26:42.720
sky. And so he lifts his eyes up above his daily concerns and he says, what I want,

26:48.880 --> 26:57.760
what I want more than anything else is that my creation will become a genuine individual.

26:58.400 --> 27:02.640
A phrase Rubin has been using a lot at this point, referring to people he speaks with is,

27:02.640 --> 27:07.600
whether I agreed with them or not, it doesn't matter whether Rubin agrees with his guests

27:07.600 --> 27:13.680
or not. Rubin's views have become far less important to this discussion and far less important

27:13.680 --> 27:19.360
to this show. The Rubin report has always been a platform for Rubin's guests to deliver their

27:19.360 --> 27:24.560
views without a serious challenge or debate. And when that platform is being heavily influenced

27:24.560 --> 27:30.400
by an anti-left audience and libertarian advocacy group, it's going to privilege certain viewpoints

27:30.400 --> 27:36.320
over others. Although Rubin frequently talks about a new center, and he's been doing this

27:36.640 --> 27:42.480
as early as the end of 2015, having borrowed the phrase from a former guest, Ali Rizvi,

27:42.480 --> 27:47.760
the term really comes into prominence here as he ties it to the Trump presidency and the guests on

27:47.760 --> 27:55.920
his show. If his show is in essence the center, why is it skewing so heavily in favor to guests

27:55.920 --> 28:02.000
from the right? In 2017, big things started happening with the Rubin report. An interview

28:02.000 --> 28:06.720
with conservative commentator Dennis Prager in January did especially well, and it was followed

28:06.720 --> 28:11.280
a few weeks later by Dave Rubin essentially announcing what many had already suspected,

28:11.280 --> 28:18.960
that he was no longer a member of the left. His Why I Left the Left video for PragerU,

28:18.960 --> 28:23.680
which I should mention is not a real university, was widely disseminated,

28:23.680 --> 28:29.840
and as of this writing it's sitting slightly under 6.5 million views. To date, it's one of

28:29.840 --> 28:34.240
the most popular on the PragerU channel, ranking right up there with videos such as

28:34.240 --> 28:39.520
The War on Boys and Don't Follow Your Passion. Really inspiring stuff.

28:40.720 --> 28:45.360
The momentum built through early 2017 with big subscriber and Patreon jumps in the first five

28:45.360 --> 28:50.320
months of the year. The big draws and interviews were former Fox News personality Glenn Beck,

28:50.320 --> 28:55.840
conservative commentator Clary Elder, and failed Canadian asylum seeker Lauren Southern. It was also

28:55.920 --> 29:01.040
when the free speech wars broke out. A time of great suffering and hardship for all.

29:01.040 --> 29:05.600
But perhaps most remembered for its great victories, immortalized by Dave Rubin and his

29:05.600 --> 29:12.800
direct message, huge win in the battle of ideas. In March of 2017, video commentator Colin Moriarty,

29:12.800 --> 29:17.520
who had recently appeared on the Rubin report as a guest, made a hackney joke on Twitter.

29:17.520 --> 29:22.320
In Moriarty's estimation, he was then the victim of a concentrated attack from opportunists in

29:22.320 --> 29:27.360
the gaming press. There's plenty of discussions on this on how accurate that assessment is on the

29:27.360 --> 29:32.640
internet, but the controversy led to Moriarty starting a Patreon that netted him $40,000

29:32.640 --> 29:37.360
a month when it opened, although it's dropped considerably since. Moriarty is only worth

29:37.360 --> 29:41.120
mentioning because of how he relates to the Rubin report. Rubin brought him on for a live

29:41.120 --> 29:45.280
discussion following the tweet, where they answered questions to the tune of Super Chats,

29:45.280 --> 29:50.880
and the Moriarty story led to, according to Rubin himself, a jump of nearly $2,000 a month

29:50.880 --> 29:57.360
in the Rubin report's Patreon support. The direct message declaring the huge win in the battle of

29:57.360 --> 30:02.480
ideas encapsulates much of what makes the Rubin report's audience tick. It's a victory parade

30:02.480 --> 30:08.000
of sorts, where victory is measured in Patreon dollars and Moriarty is championed as a martyr,

30:08.000 --> 30:11.760
although instead of 40 virgins, he got 40 grand in Patreon dollars.

30:12.560 --> 30:16.800
Support for Moriarty is best understood as him being a new hero for the audience.

30:16.800 --> 30:21.600
Much like Rubin, he took a stand against the SJWs, the Left, the Regressives, or whatever

30:21.600 --> 30:27.360
pejorative label that animates the Rubin report audience. And so long as Rubin and people like

30:27.360 --> 30:32.880
Moriarty make similar sounds, the audience is ready to reward them. The next few months,

30:32.880 --> 30:37.760
leading to the end of what Rubin colorfully referred to as Season 2 of the Rubin report,

30:37.760 --> 30:42.720
reintroduced an ambivalence to current affairs outside of stories like the Moriarty one.

30:42.720 --> 30:46.960
While the first half of 2017 wasn't devoid of news stories in the world, Rubin seemed

30:46.960 --> 30:51.600
less curious in holding Trump's feet to the fire and more concerned with stories surrounding Ann

30:51.600 --> 30:57.360
Coulter being deplatformed and Bill Maher using a racial slur. If the first year of the Rubin report

30:57.360 --> 31:02.240
was about finding his audience, the second was about the audience finding its host, as the

31:02.240 --> 31:07.520
anti-left sentiment cemented in Dave Rubin himself and the audience had the conservative-friendly

31:07.520 --> 31:12.400
voice wrapped in a left-wing package they were looking for. In a discussion with Dennis Prager,

31:12.400 --> 31:14.400
it was summed up quite nicely here.

31:42.400 --> 31:49.280
The third season of the Rubin report started in September of 2017 with the fiddently titled

31:49.280 --> 31:54.800
Season 3 of the Rubin report starts now. No mistakes on timing there. In the direct message,

31:54.800 --> 31:59.840
we get more of the usual platitudes Rubin extends to the audience and another appeal to them for

31:59.840 --> 32:11.840
booking suggestions for the new season of the show. The responses are telling.

32:11.840 --> 32:17.760
They range from libertarian poster boy Ron Paul to diluted crackpot poster boy Mark Dice.

32:18.320 --> 32:23.280
One of the few genuine voices from the left recommended is YouTuber and Dark Mother

32:23.280 --> 32:28.320
Disciple ContraPoints, but the reaction by some of the Rubin report's audience demonstrates how

32:28.320 --> 32:33.120
interested they are in voices from the left with a bit of transphobia thrown in for good measure.

32:34.240 --> 32:38.160
But the Rubin report's audience isn't the only thing moving increasingly to the right.

32:38.720 --> 32:44.240
In a direct message covering the NFL players taking a knee, which was a story about protesting

32:44.240 --> 32:49.600
police violence against black men, there was much rage amidst conservatives and it led to Donald

32:49.600 --> 32:54.800
Trump instructing owners to fire the players. Free speech defender Dave Rubin defended the

32:54.800 --> 33:00.400
players' rights while simultaneously defending the owners' right to fire the players. For a man

33:00.400 --> 33:05.680
who has spoken up so extensively about the chilling effect of being called a racist or sexist,

33:05.680 --> 33:10.960
his defense of people literally losing their job while exercising their right to free speech

33:10.960 --> 33:16.720
is a serious break from his usual fawning over the First Amendment. Looking at the comments,

33:16.720 --> 33:22.000
though, it's not the least bit surprising that the Rubin report's audience shares this sentiment,

33:22.000 --> 33:26.720
and it really demonstrates how paper thin their commitment to free speech actually is.

33:26.720 --> 33:31.040
On the week of that taking the knee direct message, Rubin's guess was Candace Owens,

33:31.040 --> 33:36.960
a commentator who operates under the label Red Pill Black. No extra points for guessing

33:36.960 --> 33:41.520
where she came down on the issue of taking the knee, and naturally the Rubin report's audience

33:41.520 --> 33:46.960
was thrilled to hear from her. The last direct message from 2017 I want to mention is from

33:46.960 --> 33:52.800
October, and it discusses the Las Vegas shooting. In contrast to the previous direct message, where

33:52.800 --> 33:57.840
Rubin very much toed the line with his audience, this one took a slightly different tactic. It's

33:57.840 --> 34:03.520
also the fourth least popular direct message on the channel. This direct message includes Rubin

34:03.520 --> 34:08.240
bucking the majority of his audience and advocating for gun control. Of course, in the message,

34:08.240 --> 34:14.400
he equivocates this by speaking at length about mental health, but to discuss gun control at all

34:14.400 --> 34:20.160
is a position the Rubin report audience have little interest in. The comments are universal

34:20.160 --> 34:24.720
in their distaste for gun control, and Rubin's crowdsourcing through the Rubin report audience

34:24.720 --> 34:30.240
for a guest to educate him on gun laws likely have the obvious effect of pushing Rubin further

34:30.240 --> 34:37.440
to the right. This is a microcosm of how the Rubin report works. It starts with a flimsily held

34:37.440 --> 34:43.600
centrist position. Rubin sources guests based on the recommendation from his anti-left crowd.

34:43.600 --> 34:49.200
An inevitable conservative comes to educate Rubin and any outliers in the audience on how to think,

34:49.200 --> 34:52.880
and everyone nodding along with the channel takes another step to the right.

34:53.600 --> 34:57.360
And those right-wing voices make the show a beacon for more right-wing viewers too.

34:58.000 --> 35:03.680
The next time Rubin introduces a topic and states his position, it'll be a little further to the

35:03.680 --> 35:09.600
right. And the next time his audience suggests or reacts to a guest, there will be more voices

35:09.600 --> 35:15.120
from the right-making comments. And the cycle continues, all while the channel keeps racking

35:15.120 --> 35:21.520
up subs and Patreon keeps racking up dollars. In that theoretical model of how the Rubin report

35:21.520 --> 35:27.600
functions, the political leanings of Dave Rubin is one of the least important variables. This is

35:27.600 --> 35:32.880
one thing I think most criticisms of the Rubin report get wrong, or at least get far too hung

35:32.880 --> 35:38.640
up on. Whatever Dave Rubin might call himself doesn't matter as much as the system he oversees.

35:39.280 --> 35:43.600
He can be a classical liberal, a secret conservative, or a clueless progressive,

35:43.600 --> 35:48.240
and it wouldn't matter. The positions of the Rubin report guests and its audience are what

35:48.240 --> 35:53.680
animate this conveyor belt that moves viewers, and Rubin himself, from the left to the right.

35:54.400 --> 35:59.120
It's possible something could disrupt this model, and perhaps an audience can only be pulled so far

35:59.120 --> 36:04.560
to the right before they check out or demand more moderate voices, but I'm not sure the Rubin report

36:04.560 --> 36:10.560
has hit that limit just yet. As I write this in early 2018, very little has changed in the land

36:10.560 --> 36:15.680
of Rubin. Dave Rubin continues to make increasingly right-wing claims, going so far as to say he would

36:15.680 --> 36:20.480
support Donald Trump over Bernie Sanders. If everything basically says like it is right now,

36:20.480 --> 36:26.480
and my choice in 2020 is either Trump, or Bernie, or Elizabeth Warren, or Gavin Newsom, or one of

36:26.480 --> 36:31.680
these crazy progressives, I'm voting Trump, and I won't have a problem doing it. And the audience

36:31.680 --> 36:37.680
is still ravenous for conversations between the likes of Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson. And

36:37.680 --> 36:42.800
with over 2 million views and 40 times the number of likes to dislikes, there's a clear sign here

36:42.800 --> 36:49.520
that the Rubin report audience has an insatiable hunger for this type of content. Compare that to

36:49.520 --> 36:55.680
the recent interview with David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, and certainly

36:55.680 --> 37:02.160
nobody's progressive, and we see the views drop down to 60,000 for the main interview, and a huge

37:02.160 --> 37:07.600
outpouring of dislikes. At this point, the Rubin report's audience is reliably on the right, if

37:07.600 --> 37:12.720
not far right. Whatever labels they wish to champion, when they have warmer reactions for

37:12.720 --> 37:19.040
the likes of Stefan Molyneux or Lauren Southern instead of David Frum, this is not traditional

37:19.040 --> 37:24.960
conservative politics. While I don't have any real data to accurately measure the political alignment

37:24.960 --> 37:29.840
of the Rubin report audience, here is some spontaneous polling of the audience at a Dave

37:29.840 --> 37:34.720
Rubin comedy show to give us a worthless anecdote. How many of you would say that you're conservatives

37:34.720 --> 37:44.400
by a round of applause? How many conservatives, how many of you, how many of you are libertarians,

37:44.400 --> 37:55.680
libertarians? All right, we did conservatives, we did libertarians. How many of you, how many

37:55.680 --> 38:05.760
progressives, how many progressives? So we got, not one, no one will say it, I mean we're not going

38:05.760 --> 38:10.960
to take, shoot you. I mean, oh we have one, we have one, please take them outside.

38:13.360 --> 38:17.360
So we did conservatives, we did libertarians, we did, how many classical liberals?

38:17.360 --> 38:28.800
Some selection biases at play here, because anyone going to a Dave Rubin comedy show must

38:28.800 --> 38:31.600
really love the guy, or pay themselves.

38:36.640 --> 38:41.200
Ultimately, I think Dave Rubin isn't just a supporter of the free marketplace of ideas,

38:41.840 --> 38:46.640
he's also a victim. By throwing the reins of his show to the audience and following the money,

38:46.640 --> 38:51.920
whatever vision he had of a show that spanned the political spectrum was co-opted by anti-left and

38:51.920 --> 38:59.040
conservative voices. The free market was never going to protect Rubin's ideal platform. How could it?

38:59.040 --> 39:03.920
As much as we might like to think everyone has a spot in the marketplace, we're limited by the

39:03.920 --> 39:08.880
people we can reach and the people who will listen to us. As much as we like to think a strong idea

39:08.880 --> 39:14.320
can survive any onslaught, it can never be heard if it's never given a platform, and a platform

39:14.320 --> 39:18.960
that refuses to engage with one side of the political spectrum, or at least grows increasingly

39:18.960 --> 39:24.400
hostile towards it, will never be a place where ideas can be fairly compared. In an ideal world,

39:24.400 --> 39:28.880
the free marketplace of ideas would truly let every idea have a shot at expressing itself,

39:28.880 --> 39:34.080
and be presented to a diverse audience capable of making a reasonable consideration of the evidence.

39:34.080 --> 39:39.280
But, in the world we've got, the ideas that get championed or platformed are often the ones coming

39:39.280 --> 39:44.800
from people with resources to make that happen. A libertarian think tank funded by wealthy people

39:44.800 --> 39:50.320
can spread its ideas of classical liberalism more easily than a trans activist with a blog.

39:51.200 --> 39:56.080
If you claim to be a space where all ideas can be discussed and then deliberately host one side

39:56.080 --> 40:01.600
far more than the other on just about every issue, you aren't the free market you pretend to be.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.560
You're an opportunist platform fighting for the status quo.

40:04.560 --> 40:06.720
I think you know what one of those places is called.
