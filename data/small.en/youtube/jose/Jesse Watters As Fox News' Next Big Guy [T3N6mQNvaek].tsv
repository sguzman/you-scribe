0	5200	April 24th while hosting one of the highest rated programs on the channel, Tucker Carlson,
5200	9920	Left Fox News. There was much celebration in left-wing spaces as one of the leading voices
9920	14240	for far-right messaging was no longer going to have a platform on the most watched cable news
14240	18960	channel in the United States. But even in that moment, people did wonder aloud just
18960	23280	who might be replacing Carlson in that coveted 8pm time slot.
23280	28080	After several weeks of rotating hosts, we got that answer on June 26th.
28080	32960	Jesse Waters would replace Tucker Carlson with his show, Jesse Waters Primetime,
32960	37600	moving to 8pm on July 17th. If you're not familiar with this guy, Jesse Waters has
37600	41600	been working for Fox News for his entire professional life. He started off as a
41600	47040	production assistant at Fox News after graduating from Trinity College with a BA in History in 2001.
47040	51040	In 2003, he was brought on to the O'Reilly Factor, which would go on to be one of the
51040	56320	top-rated shows for Fox. Waters would specialize in unexpectedly confronting interview subjects
56320	60480	in public, often creating footage that was more spectacle than informative.
60480	64480	This is the environment that shaped Waters throughout most of his professional life at
64480	67920	Fox News as he spent roughly 10 years working with O'Reilly.
67920	72560	In 2014, Waters joined the Fox News Show Outnumbered, though it was in 2015 where
72560	77920	he really got to spread his wings as the star of Waters World, a monthly special and running
77920	82640	segment on the O'Reilly Factor. In 2016, one segment garnered quite a bit of attention for
82640	87600	ostensibly being about asking Chinese Americans in New York their opinions on politics,
87600	93200	all while asking culturally insensitive questions and engaging in East Asian stereotypes.
100160	104000	There was a lot of criticism that was directed towards Waters for this segment,
104000	108960	though it didn't seem to affect his work in Fox News. This segment wasn't really that unique
108960	114080	either. He would similarly have other segments asking cab drivers about immigration and mocking
114080	119360	people at pride parades. The anatomy of these segments is pretty basic. Waters would go up to
119360	123840	random people, ask them questions, and play whatever answers they get to make people look
123840	130000	stupid, often splicing in footage of random TV shows and movies. It's a very old, tired technique.
130000	134960	You can see variations of this technique used all over TV and YouTube. It doesn't have much value
134960	138560	as a piece of journalism, but it does give an audience the opportunity to laugh at people
138560	143280	they would dislike, immigrants, people in the LGBT community, and liberals and leftists more
143280	148560	broadly. Waters' world would go from a segment and monthly special to a regular weekly series
148560	154400	in 2017. It would come to an end in January of 2022, but that's just because Jesse Waters was
154400	159920	getting a new show. Waters' largest platform more recently was his role co-hosting The Five,
159920	164960	which would eventually become Fox News' top show. Waters became one of the show's regular hosts,
164960	169760	starting in 2017. And while the makeup of The Five has changed over the years, right now it
169760	176960	consists of Waters, Greg Gutfeld, Dana Perino, Janine Pirro, Harold Ford Jr., and Jessica Tarloff.
176960	181840	Waters again courted controversy on the show for a number of remarks. Some of his more memorable
181840	187600	ones include when he said Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn't ripe enough to become
187600	193520	president. She's not ripe enough to run for president. First, she has to get married.
194480	199120	She has to plan a wedding. You want to plan a wedding and run for president at the same time?
199120	202240	And he said that teachers are taking away gender from kids.
202240	206720	Little kids are losing their gender because they get stuffed in classrooms with grooming teachers.
206720	210400	He also made this weird comment about how he can tell someone's immigration status
210400	216480	just by looking at them. I saw on the way into work a illegal immigration family digging through
216480	222240	the trash, looking for recyclables. How did you know they were illegal? You can tell. Jesse.
222240	227760	I can tell. I'm a city guy. And you don't want me to get into it, but I can tell.
227760	233600	Jesse's commentary on The Five and his commentary more broadly tends to follow this type of pattern,
233600	239200	using provocative commentary that seems designed or to shock or entertain depending on the audience.
239200	244560	It usually doesn't have much of the way of serious analysis. On The Five, his voice is balanced out
244560	249920	by the other hosts, but on his own program, Jesse Waters Primetime, we can see how Waters stands on
249920	254240	his own while under the biggest spotlight he's ever had. I should also mention that even though
254240	259360	he has a Primetime show, he is still also one of the hosts on The Five, so he's on two shows every
259360	263920	weekday for Fox News. He's a pretty big deal over there. To see how Jesse Waters has been getting
263920	268400	along, I watched the first two weeks of his show from its debut on July 17th, though I'm going to
268400	273120	mostly focus on that first week as it's fairly representative of his work. I also watched a handful
273120	277920	of episodes for the past year and it's all pretty consistent in quality. And yes, this show has been
277920	283920	on for over a year. In fact, it began airing on January 24th, 2022 as a replacement for the
283920	288880	aforementioned Waters world. So what we're getting isn't a whole new show, but rather a time slot
288880	293520	shift. Keep that in mind, as this shouldn't be seen as a show still trying to figure itself out
293520	297840	in its early days, but rather an established entity trying to fill the big hole left by the
297840	302960	departure of Tucker Carlson. Waters' show is structured like most other cable news shows,
302960	307600	a feature story that takes up the first 15 to 20 minutes, usually including a short interview.
307600	312000	The next segment will run a bit shorter, maybe five to ten minutes, and also typically has an
312000	316400	interview. And then there are a barrage of quick stories and segments, often not lasting more than
316400	320560	a minute or two. It's amazing how many segments they squeeze into this 40-minute program,
320560	324720	usually getting six or seven in each episode. And that's not counting the puff segments where
324720	329680	Waters reads text messages he gets through the program or goes on short rants about his dentist.
337760	342080	For the sake of organizing the flurry of stories and segments from just one week of the program,
342080	347360	I'm going to organize them into three categories. Real daily news, that is the news of the day that
347360	352880	is timely and relevant to the broader public, boilerplate issue news, stories that individually
352880	357600	don't mean much on their own but serve as evidence of a larger persistent issue in the news,
357600	363360	and non-news stories that have the appearance of news but are actually not reporting or commenting
363440	369120	on anything of value. I also have a bonus category for stuff that was just weird and silly. These are
369120	374400	segments I wanted to talk about but could find a place for. One of the big problems facing cable
374400	380240	news is its struggle to find enough news to fill a 24-hour schedule. That isn't to say there aren't
380240	385040	things happening in the world that are newsworthy. There are plenty of stories to fill up 24 hours.
385040	390640	The real challenge comes in finding stories that appeal to a wide audience. As I write this, there
390640	394880	is a coup happening in Niger where there is an attempt to overthrow a democratically elected
394880	400000	government. I don't expect the story to get more than a few mentions on Fox News at best,
400000	405360	and I would be absolutely shocked it was mentioned at all in Jesse Waters' primetime. In fact,
405360	410400	in the two weeks I spent watching this program, it wasn't mentioned once. On the other hand,
410400	416720	there was typically at least one story every night about Hunter Biden. This isn't just a Fox News
416720	421520	problem though. MSNBC and CNN have this same tendency to focus on stories that appeal to
421520	425920	their audiences more so than any broader principle of news of the day. After all,
425920	431440	these channels are designed to earn advertising revenue. And generally speaking, people are less
431440	436000	interested in a government being overthrown in Niger than they are about cocaine being found in
436000	440720	the White House. Which brings us to one of the few real news stories of the day that Waters covered
440720	446960	on his program. Cocaine was found in the White House. On July 13th, the Secret Service announced
446960	451120	it was closing the investigation into the small bag of cocaine found at the White House due to a
451120	456000	lack of physical evidence. This was after it was sent for testing and no fingerprints or DNA could
456000	461040	be recovered from it. That isn't to say the bag was untouched, rather it could easily mean there
461040	466640	wasn't enough uncompromised traces to provide a useful piece of evidence. On his July 18th episode,
466720	484720	Waters covered the story like this. We're already off to a bad start here,
484720	490080	as this interview he's highlighting isn't actually new. It's from Friday, July 14th,
490080	495520	four days before Waters' program aired on Tuesday. I guess this supposedly new development
495520	500080	wasn't urgent enough for him to include it in his Monday show, or maybe because it was from that
500080	504960	obscure network known as Fox Business that perhaps he's not familiar with. It's actually standard
504960	509840	police procedure to destroy drugs that aren't part of an active investigation or criminal trial.
509840	514560	If no one has been charged and the police have no evidence for an investigation, holding onto drugs
514560	519040	takes up valuable space in an evidence locker. I'm sure they have records of the evidence,
519040	523440	whether it be the test results or photographs or other things they can keep for longer storage,
523440	528240	but they simply can't hold onto every piece of drugs they find. But what's more interesting
528240	534880	here is how Waters frames this story and the only supposed path to truth now. The only way now we'll
534880	540080	ever prove whose coke it was is if Hunter confesses. The only way to find out the truth is if Hunter
540080	545440	Pieden confesses. This presupposes Hunter is the one who the drugs belong to. Waters supports this
545440	549440	claim by saying that visitor security is so tight at the White House, only a Biden family member
549440	562640	could have brought it in. Over 500 people work full time at the White House, which Waters does
562640	567040	mention later but not in the clip I just showed you because it's more important that he craft this
567040	571600	narrative first before mentioning facts that are less convenient. It's easier to ignore something
571600	576560	when a person already has the conclusion fed into their mind. Waters always places an emphasis on
576560	582080	the facts that fuel the speculation he wants his audience to engage in that this cocaine could only
582080	586880	have belonged to Hunter Biden. With 500 people working at the White House, it's quite possible
586880	591360	any one of them could have brought cocaine in there and 500 people with probably very busy,
591360	596320	intense jobs and likely coming from privileged households themselves, it's quite possible any
596320	600880	one of them could have been doing cocaine. Did the Secret Service dust the cubby for prints
601840	607120	or did they blow up the cubby also? And if you stash coke in the cubby, wouldn't you want to
607120	614560	cover it with something like put it in a backpack, put it in a book, maybe a pouch? Was there anything
614560	620160	else inside the cubby? I hate to turn this into a basic class on journalism, but asking open-ended
620160	626240	questions isn't journalism. It isn't even analysis. It's the classic conspiracy theory technique of
626240	631200	just asking questions. And with the questions Waters is asking, he's already given away the
631200	636960	game. These questions are designed to create a narrative in the mind of the viewers. Waters isn't
636960	640400	going to answer them because he simply doesn't have the evidence to back them up, but none of
640400	644400	the viewers at home are burdened with that responsibility. And if they need any nudges in
644400	648480	that direction, Waters will make the relevant assumptions and make sure the questions lead
648480	653440	toward a very specific conclusion. That is, only Hunter Biden could have left the cocaine in the
653440	658240	White House. On July 19th, Jesse Waters had an update for a request his team made for footage
658240	663040	from the White House about that cocaine in a locker. Last week, we asked for any and all
663040	667360	surveillance footage relating to the coke bag found at the White House. But the Secret Service
667360	673360	is telling us, no, they're not releasing any tapes or documents. They're telling us releasing it
673360	678320	would interfere with the investigation. But the Secret Service shut down the investigation
679200	684800	last week. This isn't news. This is nothing. Saying you tried to get some evidence, but then
684800	690880	didn't, is not a new development in the story. The subtext is that something fishy is supposedly
690880	695840	happening here, of course without actually doing the very hard work of demonstrating or
695840	701200	evidencing that something fishy is happening here. Waters also covered the very real story of former
701200	706800	President Trump facing another indictment for his role in interfering with the 2020 election.
706800	711840	It was presented like this. Well, it looks like Joe Biden's going to have Trump arrested
711840	717520	again. The only real discussion of the charges here dismisses them offhand and frame the entire
717520	723200	thing as Joe Biden trying to keep Trump occupied in court during the electoral campaign. Something
723200	728880	that's entirely conjecture and based on the idea that Biden is simply too infirm to campaign.
728880	734960	Waters is evidence for this. Supposed strategy is this. And here's Joe Biden nearly falling
734960	750480	asleep with the Israeli president. This is particularly lazy as these videos of Biden
750480	755360	falling asleep at meetings have been circulated in the past only to be revealed as being deceptively
755360	761120	edited. In this case, it's a specific section of footage where if you zoom in, you can see that
761120	765760	Biden isn't falling asleep here. He's reading some notes he placed on his lap. And if you rewind
765760	770000	the tape a little bit, you can see Biden putting those notes on his lap, which might have made it
770000	776400	more noticeable. He's not falling asleep. The rest of this segment is dedicated to dunking on CNN
776400	782480	for how they're covering the story. CNN turned into TMZ and turned Jack Smith into Tom Cruise. Watch.
784880	790480	Turns out even Jack Smith can't resist a $5 foot long. On the point about CNN, fair enough,
790480	795520	covering someone getting a sandwich on their lunch break is deeply silly and reveals how that
795520	800560	channel struggles to fill its 24 hour schedule by wasting air time talking about nonsense.
800560	805120	But how did a story about the indictment of Donald Trump turn into a story dunking on CNN and
805120	810480	hypothesizing that this is all part of Biden's electoral strategy? Probably because it's easier
810480	814880	to mock a media outlet than doing some real investigation into the story itself. If they
814880	819360	really wanted to defend former President Trump, they would dig into the details of the potential
819360	823680	charges, or what little was known about them at the time of this episode, and undermine them with
823680	828480	another set of facts or investigation. Instead of doing that though, they pivoted away from the
828480	834000	actual news to instead attack a perceived enemy. Jesse Waters Primetime is not built to handle
834000	838720	breaking news. This is one of the major challenges for commentary programs in general. To provide
838720	842880	interesting or insightful commentary, you often have to wait for a more complete picture of a
842880	847680	news story to be revealed to really analyze it. But by jumping on breaking news, it leads to
847680	852400	stacked judgments that are more often guided by an agenda or ideology than the evidence itself,
852400	856960	and that ultimately becomes what an audience is coming to see, reinforcement of a narrative more
856960	862000	so than reporting on the news of the day. Jesse Waters Tonight uses news as an impetus to push
862000	866400	narratives, creating the illusion that people are being informed when really they're just being
866400	870800	taught to think about something else when these news stories are brought up. So when someone
870800	875920	mentions Trump is facing a third indictment, someone who watches Jesse Waters Tonight is
875920	880480	now armed with a talking point about CNN worshipping the lawyer helping bring charges
880480	886080	against Trump by covering how he got a sub for lunch. That says nothing about the actual charges
886080	890560	against former President Trump, but it does create the vague impression that the media and justice
890560	895840	system are in cahoots to frame Donald Trump. This program isn't unique in that respect,
895840	900320	though it is pretty brazen in how little regard it has for using evidence of any kind to support
900320	905680	its narratives. It reminds me of a segment I saw on Tucker Carlson's program where he turned a
905680	910720	cringy White House social media post for a surprise birthday party into some grand gesture
910720	916080	demanding obedience from the people. It's like a room full of aliens have gathered to act out
916080	922000	this concept they've just heard about called happiness. Paris suddenly yells surprise at her
922000	926960	own surprise birthday party, like she's hosting the event for one of her multiple personalities.
927840	933120	What the hell is going on here? Jesse Waters doesn't have that kind of heft to his commentary,
933520	938800	he's not talking about the Democrats being in league with the powerful elites that are trying
938800	944880	to control everything you do and end white people in America. He just sort of calls the Democrats
944880	950080	corrupt, refers to them vaguely as the powers that be, and moves on from there. It's more toothless
950080	954960	than the toxic stuff you would see coming from Tucker Carlson. Boilerplate stories are the ones
954960	960160	that make up the bulk of Jesse Water Prime Time's news coverage. While every story Waters comments
960160	965120	on is tied to some kind of narrative, these are the stories that, if not for the narratives
965120	970320	attached to them, likely wouldn't be covered as news. As a point of comparison, a former president
970320	975120	being indicted is big news no matter what political decision you take. A former NBA player
975120	980400	supporting trans people at an event is not a big news story, unless you want to weave it into a
980400	985040	larger narrative regarding trans acceptance in the mainstream. This cuts in both directions,
985040	990080	by the way. Whether you want to use this clear sign of trans acceptance going up as a good thing
990160	995200	or a bad thing. Case in point, here's Jesse Waters covering that story on July 17th.
1006880	1010560	Of course, some context is missing from that clip. Here are the part of Charles
1010560	1013040	Berkeley's comments that weren't included in the clip.
1040560	1049760	Also, this is apparently something Charles Berkeley does pretty regularly.
1058800	1063920	The Berkeley non-story tumbles into another story about the live-action Snow White being more
1063920	1070000	inclusive, which tumbles into an image of some performers using the washroom. This is how quickly
1070000	1074720	Jesse Waters primetime moves from subject to subject within the same segment. All of this
1074720	1080560	eventually leads to an interview with an anti-trans activist. This new terminology was the language
1080560	1086720	of female erasure that would be used to take away my own sex-based rights. All of these little
1086720	1091360	stories and the quick interview are done within less than five minutes, and they all serve the
1091360	1098080	same purpose. A generalized anti-LGBT, more specifically anti-trans, message. A popular
1098080	1103360	narrative on the right and Fox News specifically. These little stories don't say much of anything
1103360	1109600	on their own, but the interview ties them to this narrative of some kind of coordinated effort that
1109600	1116640	apparently Charles Berkeley and Disney are working on together to trans everyone. These tiny pieces
1116640	1121920	of information are merely meant to reaffirm something someone was convinced of a while before.
1121920	1125760	None of these news stories are particularly newsworthy, but the narrative is all that matters
1125760	1129920	here, which is why they found their way onto this supposed news program. It's a triumph of
1129920	1135600	narrative over news. Another example of one of these boilerplate stories, and this was all over
1135600	1141840	Fox News in general, was the supposed cancellation of the Jason Aldean song, Try That in a Small
1141840	1146640	Town, and by canceled, they mean not having his video played on the Country Music Television
1146640	1152400	channel. The story was worth segments on the 18th and 19th, even opening an episode where nearly
1152400	1169680	15 minutes was spent talking about it. A more cynical reading of this, and one I ascribe to,
1169680	1174640	is that this whole idea of getting canceled is largely a marketing ploy. Jason Aldean has
1174640	1179040	courted controversy in the past, and that's gotten him coverage in the mainstream press.
1179040	1183920	Every time one of his controversial statements is in any way condemned, it's then flipped to make
1183920	1189280	him some kind of martyr, endearing him to the audience that watches Fox News. It's obviously
1189280	1195040	not a coincidence that, after getting canceled, Aldean's song hit number one on iTunes. The only
1195040	1199600	thing even remotely interesting about this story is that Aldean's song includes the lyrics,
1199600	1205040	cuss out a cop, spit in his face, stomp on the flag and light it up. Yeah, you think you're tough.
1205040	1208560	We'll try that in a small town. See how far you make it down the road.
1209200	1213840	First off, if you spit in a cop's face anywhere, big town or small town, that cop will almost
1213840	1219200	certainly arrest you. But what's really interesting is that line about stomping or burning the flag.
1219200	1223200	That's protected speech out of the First Amendment. It's ironic for someone to cry
1223200	1227600	censorship when their song includes a lyric about censoring the political speech of someone else,
1227600	1232080	and based on the lyrics, it doesn't sound like he's after some kind of friendly conversation.
1232160	1235840	And this water segment is an absolute joke when, in the very same episode,
1235840	1239040	we see Waters complaining about the new live-action Snow White movie,
1239040	1242720	insisting that they hire little people for the role of the Seven Dwarves.
1242720	1246560	Were Seven Dwarves not diverse enough for Disney? Think about what's better,
1247120	1251680	Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, or Snow White and the Six Unemployed Dwarves.
1251680	1255200	Disney has the artistic freedom to make any kind of movie they want,
1255200	1258400	and Waters is free to criticize them. It just seems strange that,
1258480	1262160	when someone criticizes Jason Aldean, it's considered censorship,
1262160	1264800	but not when Waters criticizes Disney.
1264800	1268720	These are the boilerplate stories that masquerade as news to push a narrative.
1268720	1273600	And while these are trivial stories, the narratives that are attached create the danger.
1273600	1276480	What's being fought over here is not the right to free expression,
1276480	1280640	but the policing of what sort of speech is acceptable in public spaces.
1280640	1284800	Contrasting these two stories can tell you a lot. When it comes to right-wing media,
1284800	1288160	a music video being pulled is an attack on American values.
1288160	1294000	When it comes to supposed left-wing media, it's an outside ideology infecting the population.
1294000	1299360	And by left-wing, we're talking about the very mild inclusivity of a soulless Disney movie.
1299360	1303200	So calling that left-wing is too generously adopting the right's framing.
1303200	1305680	It's more like centrist liberal messaging.
1306320	1310480	The idea here is to make even though centrist ideas appear far left,
1310480	1314240	and to police what sort of discourse is acceptable in popular culture.
1314240	1318320	The easiest way to do that is to engage with anything deemed popular,
1318320	1323200	and using that to frame any part of it that is left to conservative as extreme.
1323200	1326320	It both normalizes the right-wing position,
1326320	1330720	and makes any sort of centrist or left-wing position seem unthinkable.
1330720	1333200	As much as we might want to ignore these stories,
1333200	1335920	I do think it's important to acknowledge what they are.
1335920	1341120	It's not just a dopey guy chasing ratings with a ginned up story about something from pop culture,
1341120	1342480	although it is that too.
1342480	1347520	It's also an attempt to fight off even the mildest form of non-conservative messaging and culture.
1347520	1350800	It would be easy to ignore if millions of people weren't watching this,
1350800	1352880	and internalizing these messages.
1352880	1354560	While we roll our eyes,
1354560	1360640	people are mobilized on social media to harass actresses for daring to appear in certain movies.
1360640	1366960	And again, this is about a version of Snow White that has fairly modest, centrist inclusivity.
1366960	1371680	A true leftist Snow White would end with the prince abandoning the monarchy to join Snow White's
1371680	1375840	multiracial, polycule co-op where they live sustainably in harmony with nature,
1375840	1381040	taking brief breaks to disseminate anti-monarchist literature to foment rebellion in the kingdom.
1381040	1386080	And a media controlled by the left would let a bad country music slowly fade away into obscurity.
1386080	1388480	Because without the whole, canceling narrative,
1388480	1392720	everyone was happy to ignore this Jason Aldean song when it came out nearly two months ago
1392720	1394400	before the video was pulled.
1394400	1399680	Although much of the supposed outrage coming from leftists is overblown on this program,
1399680	1404240	there was at least one genuine piece of news that was upsetting.
1404240	1408640	Plowback over Florida's updated school curriculum that included language instructing
1408640	1412480	teachers to mention the benefits enslaved people got from slavery,
1412480	1416560	bringing a false sense of balance to what is an obviously hideous institution.
1416560	1419200	Here's an interesting bit of gaslighting from Waters.
1419200	1423760	Instruction includes how slaves developed skills which in some instances could be applied
1423760	1425200	for their personal benefit.
1426240	1428560	That's the section everyone's freaking out about.
1429200	1433040	I always hesitate to use the term gaslighting because it's so overused,
1433040	1436240	but in this case, I don't know how else to describe this.
1436240	1441200	Let's put Waters' statement here on the screen and compare it to what he says just seconds later.
1441600	1445200	No one is arguing slaves benefited from slavery.
1445200	1447280	No one is saying that.
1447280	1448080	It's not true.
1449200	1453760	They're teaching how black people developed skills during slavery in some instances that
1453760	1457040	could be applied for their own personal benefit.
1457600	1463280	He says no one benefited from slavery and then says that enslaved people learned skills that
1463280	1465280	they then benefited from.
1465280	1468400	It's incredible that he thinks no one can see through this.
1468480	1471920	The authors of this part of the curriculum defended their choice of words and offered
1471920	1475920	a list of examples of supposed former enslaved people who used the skills they were forced
1475920	1477200	to learn to their benefit.
1477200	1481360	A Twitter user by the name of Alexander went through the list one by one, highlighting
1481360	1484560	how the majority of these examples cited were never enslaved.
1484560	1488960	And in one case, one of the examples was George Washington's white sister.
1488960	1490880	Here it is broken down in a handy chart.
1490880	1497120	Of the 16 names cited, two of them, maybe, fit the criteria of someone formerly enslaved
1497120	1501040	who used the skills learned while enslaved in their personal life afterwards.
1501040	1506800	The two African-American academics who crafted this school curriculum don't appear to be the
1506800	1512080	best choice for crafting a curriculum when their knowledge of history is so weak.
1512080	1515440	But this is hardly a lesson worth learning at all.
1515440	1520320	The lived reality for many of the people who were enslaved, the ones who were eventually freed and
1520320	1525280	the many, many more who weren't, was not one where they acquired any sorts of skills of their
1525280	1526160	own choosing.
1526160	1530400	These were all forced on them so they could be exploited by people who owned them.
1530400	1535520	When it comes to slavery or any sort of historic event, there are numerous facts that one could
1535520	1540400	include or not include that help shape the impression of young students when it's taught
1540400	1542080	in a school curriculum.
1542080	1547280	Trying to evoke any kind of upside to slavery is a mockery of the horrors of that institution
1547280	1553040	and brings with it a false sense of balance, as if this horrible period of history requires
1553040	1555360	some kind of silver lining.
1555360	1559520	So Waters isn't entirely wrong in this case when he says the left is outraged.
1559520	1563840	A curriculum written by people ignorant of history trying to soften the impact of slavery
1563840	1567920	to a generation of children in Florida is something worth getting angry about.
1568720	1573840	The next group of stories I want to talk about that I noticed on Jesse Waters Primetime are
1573840	1575520	the non-stories.
1575520	1579520	These are stories that, once again, serve a narrative but don't even have the tenuous
1579520	1582880	link to that narrative that a low-stakes boilerplate story has.
1582880	1587120	These are some of the most weak attempts to present a facsimile of news that's designed
1587120	1590080	to feed into the fear and paranoia of the audience.
1590080	1593120	Here's one example from the July 17th episode.
1593120	1599200	It's about a federal grant of $16 million that is being used to help complete two trails
1599200	1600000	in Connecticut.
1600000	1604960	This grant is finishing a project that completes an 84-mile trail connecting the towns of Plainville
1604960	1605920	and New Britain.
1605920	1608400	Here's what that segment looked like.
1608400	1613520	New Britain, Connecticut was given $17 million in infrastructure money from Joe Biden
1614320	1616240	for an anti-racist hiking trail.
1616960	1621040	Yes, this has somehow become an anti-racist hiking trail.
1621040	1623920	But before we get to that, here are a few quick corrections.
1623920	1628720	First off, it's two trails and not one that this money is for, and these trails are for
1628720	1630000	more than hiking.
1630000	1634080	One includes a public bus route that would need to be paved and staffed.
1634080	1638960	Also, Waters had $17 million, but it's actually $16 million, something his employee gets right
1638960	1641360	when he goes to speak to the people in New Britain.
1641360	1644080	$16 million, you could take a hike in the woods.
1644080	1645440	Does that sound right?
1645440	1646880	It sounds actually quite boring.
1646880	1649360	The anti-racist part is the confusing one.
1649360	1652800	Looking at the official announcement, there's no mention of race at all.
1652800	1657040	It's part of the Rebuilding America in Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity
1657040	1661280	Program, which is part of the Investing in America initiative, which does include a
1661280	1663920	small section on racial equity being a priority.
1663920	1665360	But this specific project?
1665920	1667840	What would make it anti-racist?
1668400	1673920	The best answer I could come up with is because the population of New Britain is nearly 62%
1673920	1674960	non-white.
1674960	1679600	In 2023, the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability and Equity Program gave
1679600	1686480	out grants to 162 different projects, and the program has been around in some form since 2009.
1686480	1689920	Also, this trail project was announced back in 2022.
1689920	1693440	This is all on excuse to send this guide to a community of non-white people to get
1693440	1698240	a few quick sound bites complaining about a project that's been inaccurately framed.
1698240	1702160	This is all intercut with footage of goofy jokes to really hammer home how silly this
1702160	1704640	should all sound, but this isn't news.
1705200	1708960	It's an old story that's been trotted out to advance a tired narrative of Biden's
1708960	1714480	infrastructure plan being bad, and since there are 161 other projects getting grants like these,
1714480	1718720	among many others that are part of the broader initiative, an endless series of segments like
1718720	1723280	these can be produced with no informational value whenever they need to fill some time.
1723280	1728640	It does harken back to the earlier segments Jesse Waters did when he was working for Bill O'Reilly.
1728640	1733520	None of these were really newsworthy either, but they made people laugh and generated anger
1733520	1735040	towards the right people.
1735040	1739600	My favorite non-story though comes from the July 20th episode where Waters reported on
1739600	1743520	the discovery of an unclassified document that supposedly revealed everything about
1743520	1749120	Hunter Biden's business dealings that they were not only true but way worse than we realize,
1749120	1753520	with tapes of Joe Biden making threats and extorting people for millions of dollars.
1753520	1760640	This document details that Joe and Hunter Biden coerced a Ukrainian CEO to bribe them
1760640	1761760	10 million dollars.
1762320	1764880	The document genuinely does say all those things.
1764880	1766160	I read it myself.
1766160	1770400	Although, crucially, it doesn't actually have direct evidence.
1770400	1774480	It claims there are recordings and bank records that prove everything that's said within them.
1774480	1780640	But the document itself is just saying that this evidence exists, not actually providing
1780640	1781920	the evidence itself.
1781920	1787600	I'll let you all know right now I have no loyalty to the Biden family or the Biden administration,
1787600	1792240	and it's honestly a bit annoying whenever I have to find myself defending them because it's
1792240	1797280	important to explain how people like Jesse Waters lie about political stories all the time.
1797280	1801760	If there were real evidence that crimes were committed by anyone in the Biden family or
1801760	1804640	administration, they should absolutely be investigated.
1804640	1809040	A scandal like this would be important front page news around the world, and rightfully so.
1809040	1812080	No government official should ever be above the law.
1812080	1817360	Though the reason this story is coming up so late in my video is probably similar to the reason
1817360	1821200	even Jesse Waters didn't open his show with news of this document.
1821200	1826320	It was mentioned in the second segment of that nice program, 12 Minutes In, and he only spent
1826320	1828320	about two minutes on the story.
1828320	1832480	It reminds me of the old axiom, big if true.
1832480	1837600	The statements in this unclassified document come from an FD1023 form.
1837600	1841280	A message from the FBI explains what type of information these forms contain.
1842080	1847760	FD1023 is the form our special agencies record raw unverified reporting from confidential
1847760	1850000	human sources, CHSs.
1850000	1853040	FD1023s merely document that information.
1853040	1858080	They do not reflect the conclusions of investigators based on a fuller context or understanding.
1858080	1860480	Recording this information does not validate it,
1860480	1865120	establish its credibility, or weigh it against other information known or developed by the FBI
1865120	1866800	and our investigations.
1866800	1871760	That unverified part is particularly crucial, especially since this document comes from
1871760	1872960	2020.
1872960	1877200	Not included are any documents that reflect any investigation related to this information,
1877200	1880240	including whether or not the evidence exists at all.
1880240	1882480	None of this evidence has been presented anywhere.
1883040	1887520	This raises the possibility that the informant, who provided the information, was either lying
1887520	1889280	or mistaken about them existing.
1889280	1894080	Without any additional information, there's really nothing to go on here other than some hearsay.
1894080	1898880	In other words, until the document's information is verified, this is a non-story.
1898880	1902560	Someone making a false statement to the FBI is non-news.
1902560	1907440	After dropping this bombshell on his July 21st episode, Jesse Waters decided to open his program
1907440	1909440	with an update on the document.
1909440	1914800	If the Ukrainians have 17 tapes of the Bidens talking bribes plus bank records,
1914800	1919440	and the President Biden has sent Ukraine billions of dollars for, quote,
1919440	1924800	as long as it takes, you think the President's being blackmailed.
1924800	1929680	Getting straight to the point, do these tapes exist and is Waters going to play them for us?
1929680	1932400	And unlike Waters, I'm actually going to answer this question.
1932400	1934400	No, he doesn't play them for us.
1934400	1938160	And he doesn't show any of the bank records that supposedly exist either.
1938160	1942480	And as of readiness, none of this evidence has come to light.
1942480	1943920	We can't verify it.
1943920	1946560	But what we're doing over here is called journalism.
1946560	1948160	We're trying to verify it.
1948160	1949760	We're connecting dots.
1949760	1953440	The reason Waters opened this episode mocking other media outlets instead of
1953440	1958000	reporting on the veracity of the claims made in the document is because, as he just said,
1958000	1961600	his team hasn't been able to verify the claims made in the document either.
1961600	1966080	But that won't stop him from using this unverified piece of information to advance a narrative.
1966080	1970000	Jesse Waters claims to be a journalist, but he's not reporting any news here.
1970000	1974880	The story, if there is one, is that this document was released publicly by Republicans for reasons
1974880	1979280	that could easily be more political than a genuine attempt at investigating a crime.
1979280	1983280	Republicans using political theater to attack their opponent isn't really newsworthy,
1983280	1988240	in my opinion, and any journalist reporting on it is in some way complicit in that theater,
1988240	1991600	unless they're pointing out what the Republicans are engaged in here.
1991600	1996400	But Waters goes a step further by treating it true until proven false.
1996400	2000000	It's the triumph of narrative over evidence once again.
2000000	2003680	I mentioned the cocaine story earlier as a form of real news,
2003680	2008000	because even though it's less important than the president supposedly being blackmailed,
2008000	2012560	the key difference here is that there's evidence that someone actually left cocaine in the White
2012560	2017200	House, and there's still no evidence anything in this form is in any way true.
2017840	2020560	Now, I've been covering this Biden corruption story for a while now,
2020560	2025760	and I can feel it's finally breaking through. What about you?
2025760	2028960	This is how Waters wants his audience to understand the story.
2028960	2031680	He wants them to feel like it's true.
2031680	2036640	Not actually think it's true based on the evidence presented, just have that feeling it's true.
2037200	2042080	This last section is a collection of some bad stuff I saw in this program that I honestly
2042080	2046400	just don't know how to classify. The first are segments that were just advertisements
2046400	2049360	for politicians dressed up as a news story and interview.
2049360	2053680	On July 20th, we had a ridiculous interview with Ron DeSantis where he was making a big
2053680	2058480	deal of pulling the investments of the Florida Pension Fund out of Anheuser-Busch.
2058480	2063040	This is in response to the value of the company going down, supposedly of the backlash to the
2063040	2068560	advertising campaign featuring trans influencer Dylan Mulvaney. And by advertising campaign,
2068560	2073600	I mean they sent Mulvaney a can of beer and they made a TikTok video about it.
2073600	2078240	Middle class workers with pensions are seeing their portfolios implode.
2078240	2083520	So Florida police officers, teachers, firefighters are witnessing their retirement funds collapse.
2084320	2087600	Bud Light went woke and first responders went broke.
2087600	2092000	This sounds pretty drastic. People are supposedly going broke because of this slide in the stock.
2092000	2096960	Using the number Waters has given us, a drop in valuation of $16 billion since April,
2096960	2101120	we can compare that to Anheuser-Busch's current value of $116 billion
2101120	2104160	on the date this episode was broadcast, July 20th.
2104240	2109040	$16 billion out of the former value means Waters is counting this from when the company was valued
2109040	2113840	at $132 billion on April 1st. So roughly a drop of 12%.
2113840	2118080	Governor DeSantis gives us more information on how much of this drop affected Florida pensions.
2128160	2133040	So a loss of 12% of value from $50 million would mean a loss of $6 million
2133680	2141920	out of $180 billion or roughly 0.003% of the pension was lost because of wokeness.
2141920	2145680	I think it makes it painfully clear how little an issue this is
2145680	2151040	and it's hardly worth the governor personally intervening. Though this is effective as PR to
2151040	2155680	make DeSantis appear as some kind of warrior protecting the people of Florida from wokeness,
2155680	2159440	lest they lose 3 thousandths of a percent of their pensions.
2160000	2165280	We can see something similar in the July 19th episode where Ted Cruz was brought on so they
2165280	2171120	can rage against the Barbie movie for supposedly including a map influenced by Chinese propaganda.
2171600	2177760	If you see right here, next to Asia, shows the nine dashes. Now those dashes signify
2177760	2183520	Chinese ownership of the ocean, islands, and reefs. The Chinese believe they own the South
2183520	2188880	China Sea. But they don't. So why did the Barbie movie bow to China?
2188880	2192960	I should point out first that the map actually has eight dashes, not nine.
2192960	2197360	And it's not drawing a border. Those dashes are actually Barbie's journey from Barbieland to the
2197360	2201760	real world, at least according to a representative from Mattel. I actually haven't seen the movie.
2201760	2207120	Also, I think it's pretty obvious that this map is not meant to accurately reflect the real world.
2207120	2212800	It kind of looks like it was drawn by a child. When Cruz is interviewed, he reveals that he
2212800	2217600	hasn't seen the movie, but he does have some new legislation ready to fight Chinese censorship.
2217600	2222480	I introduced legislation, it's called the script act that says the federal government
2222480	2229440	will not allow movie makers to use US government assets, things like jets or tanks or ships or
2229440	2234320	helicopters, if they allow the Chinese government to censor their films.
2234320	2238560	US Department of Defense already has immense influence over movies produced by big studios
2238560	2244640	as it is. To get approval for using any US military assets like planes and tanks, potentially saving
2244640	2249440	a production millions of dollars, scripts have to be approved by the US Department of Defense.
2249440	2254000	These approvals sometimes include suggestions to change movie scripts to more kindly reflect
2254000	2259360	the actions of the US military. Many movies, which studios are trying to reduce the budget of,
2259360	2263920	will happily agree to these terms to get access to some of these valuable assets.
2263920	2269520	Ted Cruz's legislation is just empowering this form of governmental oversight on film productions,
2269520	2273600	making sure that a studio will have to avoid anything seemingly favorable to the Chinese
2273600	2278240	government, bringing it more in line with the official position of the US government.
2278240	2282560	If the influence of China is considered censorship by refusing access to a market,
2282560	2286400	this is just American censorship with a different incentive structure,
2286400	2289760	refusing access to millions of dollars saved in production.
2289760	2293280	All that said, I'm not sure how many movies this would apply to.
2293280	2298000	Most movies featuring the military are already mostly pro-American, and those that aren't don't
2298000	2302960	typically come out spouting Chinese propaganda. This really just seems like another publicity
2302960	2308160	stunt to create, the illusion of a politician passing legislation that will protect the people
2308320	2313760	from Chinese censorship when, in reality, it's just a bunch of hollow posturing.
2313760	2316720	There are another bunch of segments that I really don't know how to talk about,
2316720	2320320	aside from pointing out how silly they are, like the one about sharks.
2320880	2322000	Watch out for sharks.
2323760	2325040	Or alligators.
2325040	2328240	The gator hopped right out of the water and chased him halfway home.
2328800	2330240	Guy's lucky to be alive.
2330240	2332320	And then there were the cocaine sharks.
2332320	2334720	Bales of coke are now washing up in the oceans,
2334720	2340240	and marine biologists are worried that sharks, yeah, are eating the coke.
2340240	2341760	Oh, and sex robots.
2341760	2344800	They will eliminate the need for real women.
2346000	2347360	Do you believe that?
2347360	2349760	And did you know that Joe Biden got new shoes?
2349760	2351280	Joe Biden's wearing sneakers now.
2351840	2353920	He's been rocking a no sock look, too.
2353920	2356480	What about the Amish? Did you know that they're healthy?
2356480	2360960	A research foundation found that the Amish are the healthiest people in America.
2361440	2363200	That last one isn't true, by the way.
2363200	2366640	The Amish have a lot of health issues, specifically genetic disorders.
2366640	2371680	Though the reason they bring on Steve Kirsh is to push some big anti-vaccine nonsense.
2371680	2374000	These stories, of course, are all tied to narratives as well.
2374000	2376560	It's just hard to talk about every single one of them,
2376560	2379360	because they're usually very minimal and deeply silly.
2379360	2383680	Back in 2020, Fox News was sued over some comments Tucker Carlson made on his program
2383680	2384880	about Karen McDougall.
2384880	2387680	Fox News successfully defended Carlson by arguing that,
2387680	2389840	and this is a quote from the judge's opinion,
2389840	2393360	the general tenor of the show should then inform a viewer that
2393360	2397200	Carlson is not stating actual facts about the topics he discusses
2397200	2401760	and is instead engaging in exaggeration and non-literal commentary.
2401760	2405440	This has been broadly understood to mean that Fox News' lawyers were arguing
2405440	2409440	that no audience would ever believe Tucker Carlson was telling the truth about anything.
2409440	2411840	The actual opinion is a bit more narrow,
2411840	2414960	using details of the script to say that it should have been clear that
2414960	2418560	Carlson's statements were in that particular episode,
2418560	2420560	and I'm quoting from the judge's opinion here,
2420560	2424320	exaggeration, non-literal commentary were simply
2424320	2426560	bloviating for his audience.
2426560	2429120	This speaks to how scripts on Fox News are written,
2429120	2432480	and something that can be seen in the same work Jesse Waters does.
2432480	2434880	One of the tougher things to nail down when covering Waters,
2434880	2437040	or any of these more polished presenters,
2437040	2440960	is that their scripts are put together with caveats and other rhetorical protections
2440960	2444960	to protect them from being tied to the narratives they're so obviously pushing.
2444960	2447440	They use questions and offer assumptions,
2447440	2450000	though when you see the pattern of these questions and assumptions,
2450000	2452640	they always point things in the same direction.
2452640	2456800	It protects the hosts from the liability of making these claims
2456800	2459600	while still advancing them in the minds of their viewers.
2459600	2461360	To use a more controversial example,
2461360	2464720	whenever someone has questions about a genocide,
2464720	2468880	it only ever seems to be questions that suggest it wasn't as bad as people think,
2468880	2470800	or that it possibly never happened.
2470800	2475520	The questions never seem to wonder that it might have been even worse or more widespread,
2475520	2478960	because these questions are searching for a specific answer.
2478960	2483600	It's how you deny something horrible happened without actually saying it outright.
2483600	2487360	You simply ask questions and let the audience answer them in their head.
2487360	2491280	The assumptions are even more telling as leaps of logic are taken as facts,
2491280	2493200	always moving toward the same conclusion.
2493840	2497760	Here's a segment from July 27th that really show that in action.
2497760	2500080	It starts off with a single piece of evidence,
2500080	2502480	a statement from a supposed IRS whistleblower,
2502480	2504560	and we're going to see how this program twists it.
2504560	2507920	The IRS whistleblowers confirm when I asked
2507920	2513040	if they had documents pertaining to foreign accounts and they said they did.
2513040	2515760	So with regard to the Hunter Biden investigation,
2515760	2517280	foreign accounts are a part of it.
2517280	2519120	Now let's look at the speculation.
2519120	2523280	With Joe, I suspect there are offshore accounts.
2523280	2524800	Based on what Comer has said,
2524800	2528320	he is speculating that the account or accounts belong to Joe Biden.
2528320	2529840	Looking at his original statement,
2529840	2532800	we don't even have confirmation that it belongs to any Biden,
2532800	2537120	just that in this whole story, a foreign account or accounts were used.
2537120	2539440	Then water starts to grow that speculation.
2539440	2544400	IRS whistleblowers have indicated that they have documents suggesting that the Biden family,
2544400	2547920	possibly Joe Biden himself, are hiding money offshore.
2547920	2550720	Sources tell Primetime they have not seen the documents yet,
2550720	2555040	but when they do, it goes through a vote and then the documents will be released.
2555600	2558640	Notice that even though he opens with speculation,
2558640	2562160	he tempers all of that, kind of protecting himself when he says that
2562160	2564880	we won't know any more details about these bank accounts,
2564880	2568560	as they have to go through the House Ways and Means Committee to be approved for release first.
2568560	2573120	But that doesn't stop him from building on that speculation with a series of questions.
2573120	2576400	Why would Joe Biden receive money through shell companies from his son?
2576400	2579840	And why wouldn't Joe Biden have an offshore bank account?
2580400	2583920	We don't even have evidence that this account or accounts belong to Joe Biden,
2583920	2587280	but these questions make sense if you're willing to join waters on this ride
2587280	2589360	that just assumes that to be the case.
2589440	2592640	I note how the questions all seem to be moving towards the same answer,
2592640	2596960	that Joe Biden has some suspicious foreign bank accounts for a nefarious purpose.
2596960	2598640	And then we get to the conclusion.
2598640	2603680	Once you start zeroing in on foreign, foreign bank accounts, foreign lobbying,
2603680	2608400	foreign agents, foreign business partners, foreign policy, foreign deals,
2609040	2611040	that's fertile ground for impeachment.
2611840	2615360	That's when you get into conspiracy, money laundering, even treason.
2616320	2619280	And that's why this looks more and more like a bribery ring.
2619520	2621440	So what we have here is bribery.
2621440	2624240	And I'll remind you, this all started from the fact that
2624240	2629120	someone said that this case involves foreign accounts and that is morphed into
2629120	2630960	Joe Biden is being bribed.
2630960	2634400	This is how the assumptions made by Waters and the questions he asked
2634400	2637680	move the audience towards specific conclusions that
2637680	2640720	Joe Biden is involved in some kind of elaborate corruption
2640720	2643520	and no real evidence of any of that is presented.
2643520	2646240	It's all very circumstantial and speculative.
2646240	2649600	Waters has proven that he can work in unison with Fox News more broadly,
2649600	2651920	pushing narratives the channel finds useful.
2651920	2654880	And unlike Tucker Carlson, he doesn't stray as obviously
2654880	2659600	into the white nationalist talking points, aside from the one or two odd turns.
2659600	2662480	Waters mostly stays in the realm of the mainstream right.
2662480	2664800	And he would sooner spend the rest of his time
2664800	2668800	complaining about infrastructure to attack anti-racism
2668800	2672800	and not using stories of men tanning their balls to advance fascism.
2672800	2675120	Waters, as a product of the Fox News system,
2675120	2677440	is probably the perfect guy for the role he's in.
2677440	2680800	And the few weeks we got of others trying out for the APM slot
2680800	2685040	were probably to make sure he wasn't too obviously seen as Tucker Carlson's replacement,
2685040	2687760	ensuring that the audience wouldn't turn on him right away.
2687760	2691520	All Jesse Waters needs to do is keep his nose clean and not get into any trouble.
2691520	2694800	And he can probably enjoy a long career telling the Fox News audience
2694800	2699200	exactly what they want to hear, unless he runs his mouth and gets himself into trouble.
2702800	2704720	I did let the air out of her tires.
2705680	2707280	She couldn't go anywhere.
2707280	2708000	She needed a lift.
2708000	2709200	I said, hey, you need a lift?
2709200	2710320	She got right in the car.
2710320	2711280	Does she know this story?
2711280	2712560	No, she doesn't know the story.
2712560	2714000	Did she watch your shows?
2714000	2715040	Did Jesse watch?
2715040	2717920	Credit to Juliet Jeske for popularizing that clip.
2717920	2721280	Also, her publicly available research helped provide some additional context
2721280	2723440	for Fox News more broadly while working on this video.
2723440	2726320	Check out her stuff on Decoding Fox News if you get the chance.
2726320	2730720	And for the record, in that clip, Jesse Waters has claimed that he was just joking.
2730720	2736240	What absolutely isn't a joke is that at the time, Waters' future wife was working for him.
2736240	2738960	And she's also the woman he cheated on his first wife with.
2738960	2740800	So he seems like a lovely guy.
2740800	2747280	It does make one thing that his future might not be entirely dissimilar from his mentor, Bill O'Reilly.
2747280	2751760	I guess we'll see what becomes of Waters and his dollar store David Schwimmer haircut.
2752480	2756240	One thing I wanted to laugh at but didn't really know how to talk about in the video
2756240	2761600	was the fact that at the end of every episode, Jesse Waters has a tagline where he says,
2761600	2764320	I'm Jesse Waters and this is my world.
2764320	2767840	From the look on his face when he does it, you can tell he's so proud he came up with it.
2767840	2771280	And it's also maybe one of the worst things I've ever heard.
2771280	2775360	I don't know why you'd want your catchphrase to be modeled after one of the most famous
2775360	2777360	box office bombs in history.
2777360	2780560	But I would never accuse Jesse Waters of ever being clever.
2780560	2784640	But if you think I'm clever and would like to support me through some sort of
2784640	2789760	financial means, you can become like all the lovely names you see floating up the screen now
2789760	2792400	by joining my Patreon and supporting me there.
2792400	2795680	You can also become a YouTube member if that's more convenient for you.

2800320	2801680	for notifications.
2801680	2805840	If you don't know what to comment, why not share your favorite box office bomb?
2805840	2809760	Extra points if you can somehow weave it into a clever sign off.
2809760	2812320	Like, I'll be black in a flash.
2812320	2815840	Thank you all so much for watching.
