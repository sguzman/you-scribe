0	5620	Tucker Carlson hosts the most popular cable news show on television his most recent ratings show
5620	11360	He averaged 3.2 million viewers a night on Fox News with his Tucker Carlson tonight program
11360	15560	It debuted on November 14th 2016 originally at 7 p.m
15560	21400	But following the cancellation of the O'Reilly Factor Tucker inherited the 8 p.m. Time slot in 2017
21400	28480	The show grew in popularity topping out at four point three three million viewers in the second quarter of 2020 the most viewers ever
28600	35800	For a cable news program in the United States the show proves so popular that Fox News expanded its relationship with Tucker Carlson in the spring
35800	42320	Of 2021 by giving him a morning show Tucker Carlson today that errors three times a week and Tucker Carlson originals
42320	46440	Which airs once a month both of these appearing on the Fox Nation streaming platform
46520	52280	If you're not familiar with who Tucker Carlson is a very brief recap is that he lived a middle-class life as a child
52280	57440	Until his father married into the wealthy Swanson family whose fortune come from those frozen TV dinners
57440	62720	His privileged life led him to a career in journalism where he wrote for a few conservative outlets in
62960	65400	2000 he worked at CNN on a show called crossfire
65400	71560	This show ended when he was embarrassed by John Stewart on camera and Carlson did not renew his CNN contract
71560	77600	He then spent some time at PBS had a show on MSNBC for a few years before finally finding a home at Fox News in
77720	84160	2009 where he was eventually given his own show in 2017 if you want more details about the history of Tucker Carlson
84160	90120	I highly recommend this recap of his life from some more news with all this Tucker Carlson content on offer
90120	96320	I decided to consume a whole week's worth of his stuff to get an idea of what it's like to be in the Tucker Carlson
96320	102680	Audience and what it feels like to get the full effect of his work. This is for the week of October 18th
103480	105480	2021 now
105480	115160	The first part of every episode of Tucker Carlson tonight is the feature story typically rating from 15 to 20 minutes
115160	119240	It makes a path of each episode and is usually the part that has everyone buzzing the next day
119240	125040	These feature stories are largely centered around a monologue where Carlson builds his case and they're capped off with a brief interview
125200	128120	The October 18th edition of the show offers a great example
128120	132720	It began with the recent passing of former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell
133200	140800	Unlike other people in Washington Colin Powell got where he was on merit and that was inspiring to watch and eventually it turned
140800	145240	Into a rant about how Americans are living in a medical apartheid state
145400	147920	We have a division medical apartheid
148080	152840	We have rules but some people have exempted themselves from the rules and they're not ashamed of it
152840	155960	Here's how he made the jump the crucial step in drawing a connection between
156200	161840	Powell's death and this authoritarian nightmare is that Powell died of complications related to COVID-19
161840	168680	Even though he had been vaccinated once this connection is made two minutes into this 14-minute segment. It stops being about Powell entirely
169520	175920	Like almost everyone his age Colin Powell was fully vaccinated against COVID and yet according to his family and doctors
175920	180240	Colin Powell died of COVID. Of course that fact does not make his death any less sad
180560	184960	Nor is it unusual many thousands of vaccinated Americans have died of COVID
185520	192160	Former CDC director Robert Redfield announced just today that about 40% of all recent COVID deaths in the state of Maryland
192160	194640	For example are among those who have had both shots
195200	202240	This is a deeply deceptive stat looking at Maryland alone the eighth most vaccinated state with at the time of writing
203240	205640	65.8% of its population being fully vaccinated
205960	212740	This would mean that breakthrough cases that is cases of vaccinated people suffering from COVID would be more common because such a large
212860	214860	percentage of the state is fully vaccinated
214980	220060	The State Department of Health agrees writing in a statement as the number of our residents who are vaccinated
220740	227660	Continues to increase we expect to see an increase in the proportion of COVID related deaths occurring in vaccinated individuals
227860	232060	Many of these deaths are linked to comorbidities that make patients more vulnerable
232660	238860	Even on its face though if most people are fully vaccinated and the majority of deaths are still attributed to the unvaccinated
239020	241020	It seems like getting a vaccine is a good idea
241100	246780	A wider view of the numbers available from the CDC reveals that COVID deaths are dramatically more common among the unvaccinated
246780	250940	With the unvaccinated being 11 times more likely to die of COVID than the vaccinated
251340	255580	Powell's death is an anecdote a high profile case of something that isn't terribly common
255660	258780	It's being used to push a narrative about skepticism towards the vaccine
258860	263420	It's all a pretense to get to the real message of the segment. What tells you you've been lied to
263900	269420	Vaccines may be highly useful for some people but across a population they do not solve COVID
269740	276220	The language here is crucial. What does solve COVID even mean that a vaccine will completely eliminate it?
276620	283180	Vaccines rarely eradicate illnesses with the only transmissible one among humans that has been wiped out so far being smallpox
283420	289580	The vague usage of solve and how it will never be achieved is how carlson can apply that the vaccine really isn't worth getting
289820	297020	At least for most people without outright denying it has any significant effect at all his earlier statement implies that it's a very narrow effect
297580	299980	Vaccines may be highly useful for some people
300220	303980	The covet vaccine has been demonstrated to dramatically reduce one's chance of death
303980	306860	But the number of deaths aren't the only talking point carlson uses
307180	312140	Carlson also says the vaccine doesn't effectively slow the spread of covet. This also isn't true
312460	317580	Craig spencer an emergency medicine physician and director of global health and emergency medicine at new york
317820	321500	Presbyterian columbia university medical center writing for the atlantic said
321820	328300	Despread the coronavirus you have to have the coronavirus and vaccinated people are far less likely to have the corona virus
328700	329580	period
329580	334940	Even in instances of breakthrough cases where a vaccinated person is infected with the delta variant of covet
335160	338780	Preliminary data shows that transmission is reduced by 63 percent
339020	344940	Albeit for a period of a few months for the alpha variant of covet transmission is even more greatly reduced by a vaccine
345260	349180	Increasing to 73 percent a lot of this data is still being peer reviewed
349180	354220	But so far the majority of the science seems to be saying the exact opposite of what tucker carlson is asserting
354460	358220	But he doesn't say any of it in intent to accurately discuss the science of the day
358380	365900	It's all the guys to get to what he really wants to talk about president biden is demanding obedience and people are fearfully obeying him
366300	367660	They're afraid of you
367660	373100	They can't explain why they're afraid of you the president told them that you are dangerous and so they're afraid
374060	380620	The question is over time. What does that do to your most cherished relationships to your friendship to your family relationships?
381180	383180	What does it do to the country?
383260	390060	The biden administration is apparently using the pandemic to destroy american families or as tucker would put it
390620	396620	America has once again become what it was when colin powell got his commission in the army
396860	402380	America has become segregated not between black and white but between vaccinated and unvaccinated
402860	405740	This is how tucker creates the illusion of a coherent narrative
405900	413500	Colin powell being alive during segregation is purely incidental and segregation itself was a deliberate attempt to restrict black people from positions of
413500	416940	Powered influence within american society because of the color of their skin
417100	422940	Which is hardly the same as not letting someone who is far more likely to carry an infectious disease eat at an applebee's
423500	428540	But what makes tucker carlson particularly effective is that he isn't just spreading partisan talking points
428620	431900	His monologues also include a healthy dose of conspiracy theories
432220	438380	This is a pandemic of the chinese government born in a lab in wuhan and brought here either accidentally or not
438460	439980	That's the fact of it
439980	441900	This is also not a fact
441900	447740	The current state of the debate according to an article in the new yorker is that there is no conclusive evidence to support that claim
447900	452220	And most scientists who study viruses are inclined to say it was a naturally occurring virus
452540	459260	The most plausible version of this theory is that it was being studied at this lab and was accidentally leaked because of a lack of safety precautions
459980	462300	Not that it was created by the chinese government
462940	465500	The rent continues like this for nearly 10 minutes
465580	471980	It's a fire hose of misinformation and by 10 minutes in it's spiraling into madness as a few seconds of video of joe biden
471980	475660	Not wearing a mask at a restaurant is used as evidence of him declaring himself
475900	480540	Some kind of grand ruler as only servants wear masks, but he didn't wear a mask
481100	482140	Why?
482140	485660	Because masks are for servants and he's the president. He's not a servant
485980	491100	The official explanation here is that biden was eating at a restaurant and was in the process of putting his mask back on
491180	493180	Having taken it off to eat his food
493580	497740	Something that I am inclined to believe since you can clearly see him molding the mask as he walks
498060	501980	The video was widely circulated on right-wing media as biden flaunting the rules
502060	506860	But tucker carlson takes it even further saying biden meant to be filmed to send a message to americans
507020	512940	A message that ironically never would have been heard had not right-wing media figures like himself obsessed over it
513260	515100	This clip itself is not a story
515100	521260	But it does offer a wonderful example of how right-wing media takes innocuous footage to concoct a narrative biden being slow to put
521260	525260	His mask on is now him telling america that he is their god king
525580	528220	And wasn't this whole segment about colin pal's death?
528300	532940	And now we're talking about how joe biden being filmed in a restaurant not wearing a mask for a few seconds
533100	535660	Means he's crowning himself the emperor of america
535820	538700	It was as if this whole monologue was written independent of pal's death
538780	542380	And then that part was inserted later to make the narrative seem newsworthy
542460	547100	And one last detail about colin powell carston did eventually share with us also seemed important
547340	550220	So being the show we told you about colin powell
550380	554780	We left out that colin powell was suffering from a number of different health problems
555260	558940	But of course, that's the point the point of vaccinating the vulnerable is so
559500	563500	People with other underlying health problems won't die of covet
564060	569500	But unfortunately that didn't work in the case of general powell and it didn't work for many thousands of other americans
569580	571580	And of course, that's the point we're making in the first place
571900	577900	Colum pal was suffering from multiple myeloma which compromised his immune system making the vaccine less effective
578140	584780	An important detail if you're trying to claim that the vaccine itself is ineffective a detail that completely undermines his entire rant
584940	590060	Which is why it happens more than 25 minutes after the segment is over just as the show is going off the air
590380	593420	Because this rant was a con and tucker carlson knows it
593820	598700	But that monologue was believe it or not the strongest and most convincing one I saw that week
598780	602780	I want to talk about two other ones that show us how things can get really crazy on this show
603260	608380	On october 20th tucker carlson started a show with a segment that had an impressive number of jumps
608620	613580	We started with a statement about how america was changed by the black lives matter movement of 2020
613820	615820	This really was the pivot point
615820	618860	It was the height of the blm riots early last summer
619020	625260	Which turns into a story of how the media lies to people msnbc's explicit editorial policy
625740	631580	To lie about what you were watching live to characterize violent riots as peaceful protests
631660	636700	And then this moves to a discussion about looting the country your ancestors built is on fire
637100	639580	But shut up because your ancestors also burned it down
640060	643980	Which pivots to an article about supply chain issues in the u.s
644300	646700	The washington post just ran this headline and we're quoting
647260	651740	Don't rant about short staff stores and supply chain woes
652300	655580	And apparently america is now falling apart. Don't complain
656780	661820	As your life becomes worse and as your country degrades this leads to a point about store closures
662140	668780	You notice the wall greens is for example closed and so is the cvs because everything in there has been stolen
669100	673980	By thieves who have now been redefined as civil rights protesters. Stop complaining karen
674300	679180	And suddenly we're talking about cities being overrun with drug addicts. Oh, wait a second
679180	683260	They're junkies living intense right across from your kid's school
684060	686860	Well that they've always been there too. They were there when you were a kid
686860	693740	You just never noticed just readjust your expectations settle down karen and their undocumented immigrant rapist on trains
694540	699740	Last week several people on train they got on the train and then they got to watch as a man raped a woman
700140	704860	On the train for minutes and biden's border policy is destroying america
705100	710380	You want more of this? We may be getting it today joe biden's nominee to lead the border patrol a guy called chris magnus
710620	712620	Set for his confirmation hearings
712860	717660	Now it turns out that magnus if anything is to the left of biden
717980	720780	Even to the left of barack obama on immigration matters
720940	726540	Did you follow all that black lives matter is somehow connected to joe biden destroying america with immigrants?
727100	733100	Or the impression carlson's audience more likely got that america is being destroyed and it's biden's fault
733340	736620	The house and wise aren't important. The segment isn't designed to be coherent
736780	743900	It's designed to create a vague feeling of fear about the state of america and to direct that fear and possibly anger towards joe biden
744060	747340	The segment itself is of course filled with misinformation
747660	754080	Take the op-ed from the washington post which tucker claims is an attack on americans telling them to lower their expectations
754540	757920	As if they need to be ready for some kind of socialist hellscape
758540	761580	Lower your expectations. What did you expect in america?
762140	764140	Come on
764140	766140	Bread lines we've always had bread lines
766620	773260	It's sort of charmingly retro these bread lines if we read beyond the headline what the article by micheline manard
773580	775580	Actually says is
775580	780540	Rather than living constantly on the verge of throwing a fit and risking taking it out on overwhelmed servers
780700	787040	Struggling shop owners or late arriving delivery people. We do ourselves a favor by consciously lowering expectations
787500	789340	Rather than being an attack on americans
789420	795340	It's a simple plea for americans not to take their frustrations out on workers who have no control over supply chain issues
795740	801740	Carlson also claims that wall green stores in san francisco are closing because of organized shoplifting. San francisco has
802220	806940	Very few wallgreens or cvs or stores like that left because they've all been looted
807500	808940	by civil rights protesters
808940	816300	This is contradicted by numbers from the police which do not support this wave of shoplifting at wallgreens a narrative codman on social media
816380	823740	Based on a handful of cell phone videos wallgreens has not only refused to share internal data related to shoplifting with reporters in san francisco
823900	831020	Their parent company wallgreens boots alliance was forecasting between 150 and 400 store closures by 2024
831340	837740	since 2016 wallgreens has closed 22 stores in san francisco and those numbers include the recent story tuckers responding to
837900	841180	In which wallgreens had announced it was closing five stores
841660	847900	Now san francisco has very few wallgreens or cvs or stores like that left because they've all been looted
848380	853500	It still has 53 stores operating in san francisco a far cry from what tucker claims
853900	858700	Also not mentioned in this segment is that in new york city wallgreens is shutting down 16 stores
858780	863580	I suspect it might have made it into the segment had they found cell phone footage of a black person stealing something though
863740	871740	Which by the way is used to justify the earlier mention of black lives matter, which was about making shoplifting legal according to tucker carlson
872140	878140	It's also interesting to see how tucker carlson who many describe as a populace parroting the talking points of a corporation like wallgreens
878220	884300	Which happily spreads the organized shoplifting talking point to disguise the fact that it had been planning to close stores
884600	887340	regardless of this supposed wave of shoplifting
887980	893340	Perhaps tucker is happily towing this corporate line because it at least lets him demonize black communities
894220	897420	It's the jumps that really make this segment more than misinformation though
897500	903180	The narrative through line of america's decay is barely held together as tucker jumps from one sensationalized story to another
903260	908460	And he uses folksy little turns of phrase or rolls out the carrot insult to engage his audience emotionally
908940	915340	This isn't designed to get people thinking about the news of the day. It's designed to rally their emotions against the left
916220	922780	Tucker carlson's opening stories are so narrative focused that sometimes he doesn't even need to misrepresent actual news stories
922940	927020	In some cases he just presents something made up entirely out of nothing
927260	930540	That is so obviously true in the october 21st show
930780	935120	This segment opens with some truly shocking footage released by the biden administration
945340	968700	Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to my president, happy birthday to you
969660	975020	Before moving on I want everyone to take a moment and think about what this video says
975260	976860	And you don't need any deep analysis here
976860	983100	Just think about the events you saw unfold and what they were about really ask yourself. Does anything seem amiss here?
983420	985740	Does this footage reveal some hidden truth?
986460	988860	Okay, here's what tucker thought when he watched that video
989100	994780	It's like a room full of aliens have gathered to act out this concept. They've just heard about called happiness
995500	998780	The head alien is a super naturally strange being called
999320	1005580	Kamala harris who for reasons no one ever explains walks into a room in the most secure building in the world
1005820	1012540	With a piece of elasti-sized fabric over her face like that's totally normal just another masked birthday celebration
1013340	1020960	harris suddenly yells surprise at her own surprise birthday party like she's hosting the event for one of her multiple personalities
1021900	1023740	What the hell is going on here?
1023740	1030300	I can answer that question harris acted awkwardly during a surprise birthday party and everyone is wearing masks because of covet
1030620	1033100	But tucker has to pretend this is some bizarre
1033400	1039340	unthinkable scenario where people are acting in strange and confusing ways ways that reveal a deep mental rot at the core of the
1039340	1040380	biden white house
1040380	1046140	He goes on for several minutes about these videos making a number of strange points like that. No one says gorgeous anymore
1046460	1051440	She goes on to use the word gorgeous a word that no actual human being has used since 1977
1052400	1059520	I am completely willing to believe no one calls tucker gorgeous, but that doesn't mean no one says it. First of all is the answer. Yes
1062880	1071680	Ready to work. I am ready to do this with you for you. I I just i'm just deeply honored and i'm very excited
1074880	1076480	Whoa
1076480	1081840	Indeed nearly six minutes in and all tucker is talking about are these social media posts
1081840	1084080	He's calling them staged and even if they are
1084720	1091920	So what their pieces of pr are designed to make president biden and vice president harris seem more human and relatable much like your grandpa
1092080	1094640	Joe biden also doesn't know how to turn off a speakerphone
1095200	1100320	If these moments are staged the fact that none of these people are actors should explain the awkward delivery
1100400	1106080	But to tucker carlson, there's something far more sinister more sinister than north korean military propaganda
1107120	1110160	But what's the message of the joe and kamala videos?
1110880	1114720	All your nightmares are real the people in charge are even worse than you thought they were
1115280	1118160	Kamala may have seemed kind of fake to you joe may have looked a little out of it
1118320	1122160	But actually the white house is now telling us you don't know the half of it
1122720	1127600	According to tucker the white house is trying to tell everyone that these people are losing their mind or robots
1127760	1133040	These are presented as basic readings of these videos and not right-wing spin and that's what makes it so effective
1133280	1138000	The phrasing demands the audience accept the basic premise just to get to the conspiracy theory
1138080	1144080	You must believe joe biden is senile before getting to the idea that this is a deliberate move by the white house to rub it
1144080	1145520	in everyone's faces
1145520	1149360	Why they would do this is never really explored the conspiracy theory is a bonus
1149600	1155840	Because the main point here is to reinforce the idea that joe biden is senile and that kamala harris is some kind of robot
1156320	1161760	This is one third of the way into this night's commentary and have you spotted anything newsworthy so far?
1162080	1168640	All we've seen is tucker carlson opine about some harmless social media pr posts, but it does get even more intense
1168960	1172960	In december of last year kamala harris who grew up in canada a foreign country
1173280	1177920	I appreciate the subtle menace tucker carlson has when he describes canada as a foreign country
1178080	1184160	We usually don't get much credit for how scary we are tucker is really shocked at how brazen a lie harris told was though
1184480	1190720	Swore that she witnessed quote multiple generations of her family celebrating kwanza an american holiday
1190800	1197840	That was invented in long beach california after kamala harris was born. Not one word is true, but not one word is believable
1198560	1203120	Again, it was a prepared statement. It was carefully considered. They didn't even bother to look at a calendar
1204000	1209520	Luckily for us. I did look at a calendar kamala harris was born in 1964 in california
1209680	1212480	The american celebration of kwanza was first held in
1213740	1220640	1966 so the idea of kamala harris celebrating this with her family including parents and grandparents as a child seems pretty reasonable
1221040	1224820	This is likely what she meant when she said celebrating across generations
1225360	1230400	As for the canada part harris was born in california and moved to montreal when she was 12
1230640	1234160	She moved back to the us at 18 to attend howard university in washington d.c
1234400	1240740	So is it really hard to imagine that between the ages of 2 and 12 she might have celebrated kwanza with her parents and grandparents
1241600	1244000	Also kwanza may have started in the u.s
1244000	1250400	But it's celebrated in canada too and even if it wasn't there are no canadian laws preventing american families
1250400	1256880	From celebrating kwanza in montreal the segment is nearly 10 minutes through and it's completely filled with stuff like this
1257120	1260400	Tucker carlson reacting to dopey videos released by the white house
1260640	1264800	This is the news he thinks is worth commenting on and to make it seem worthwhile
1264960	1270640	He needs to make it sound as dramatic and scary as possible. It goes as far as to compare it to a cult
1271280	1273280	It's kind of nuts when you think about it
1273520	1279360	These people literally have no idea how absurd they look and how could they they live in a tiny airless cult
1279600	1283600	Wherever one pretends that joe biden is fully competent. Kamala harris is a civil rights hero
1284080	1291200	It's jones town and he brings a guest on to tell us that these videos are somehow related to communism
1291520	1295680	It's because every part of the system is so corrupt now and rotted with this communist filth
1295840	1300800	And that would you think of everyone here as sociopaths these people are not capable of that kind of shame
1300800	1304240	It's not in their nature. They are completely lost. They're sociopaths all of them
1304400	1311280	This is literally all this segment is I suspect the jesse keller interview only went on as long as it did over three minutes
1311440	1313840	Because of how little substance was actually present
1314000	1321120	I'm genuinely impressed that tucker carlson took something as flat and sparse of content such as pr videos on white house social media
1321280	1326400	And turned it into a narrative about some kind of biden cult slash obama's third term
1326640	1330400	This is obama's third term and these people are picked because they're compliant and hollow
1330560	1337680	But this segment more than all the others demonstrates what this show does it takes news stories or sometimes things that are barely news
1337760	1344500	Events lies about them and then builds these fantastic narratives of cults and oppression to oppose the biden administration
1344880	1350480	Isn't to have a political disagreement. It's to be standing against the monstrous sociopaths who want to destroy america
1350640	1357280	It catastrophizes political reality to such an extreme that the opposition can only be understood as the most dire of threats
1357600	1362880	And then tucker will in the same breath complain about how the other side is trying to divide us
1363200	1370320	Which is rich coming from someone who uses a video about flowers being delivered to push a narrative about a cult destroying america
1371360	1374560	While the opening segment is tucker carlson's show at its purest
1374800	1378240	The show does go on for another 20 to 25 minutes after it's over
1378400	1385200	These are the quick hits where five or six different stories are crammed into tiny segments that leave the audience less informed and more afraid
1385760	1390160	Here's a quick example of a story from the october 18th episode in recent weeks
1390460	1398080	Thousands of illegal aliens have been flown from the texas border into westchester county airport in new york on charter jets
1398640	1404800	Presented as breaking news is the story of children being flown from the southern us border to new york
1404960	1409840	He interviews conservative new york post columnist miranda divine for details by the government
1409840	1412000	They were all unaccompanied children
1412000	1417360	But several of them did look to us to be males in their 20s late teens
1417680	1423120	Some of the language here should raise some alarm according to the government the people being brought to new york are all children
1423200	1429120	But according to divine some of them looked older the photos used on tv make it tough to tell
1429200	1431200	But if you look at the new york post article
1431200	1438000	There are much clearer photos of these people who are obviously children as they're significantly shorter than the man who is escorting them
1438320	1443840	Also when divine claims that these flights are coming in the dead of night that isn't what we're seeing in these photos
1444240	1449760	According to the article these photos were of flights that arrived at 9 52 pm and 10 49 pm
1450080	1453360	There is a record of two flights landing at 2 13 a.m
1453360	1459120	And 4 29 a.m on august 20th, but these are the only examples offered in the article that might be considered
1459520	1460720	The dead of night
1460720	1466320	It then describes that these children are being sent to family members and those without family members are going to an organization called
1466640	1473440	Mercy first which works with the u.s office of refugee resettlement to find kids who have been granted refugee status safe homes
1473920	1478720	These brief few minutes are used to illustrate that the biden administration is somehow breaking the law
1479040	1483520	and that it needs to offer greater transparency on where refugee children are being settled because
1484000	1489520	Well, they never really say why tucker does mention that some kind of federal law is being violated
1489760	1493520	But he doesn't say which one and the only evidence of something nefarious going on
1493520	1496880	Is that some of these flights might be past the bedtimes of these children?
1497200	1501520	They can't come out and say what they want their audience to think because that wouldn't be as safe as the dog whistle
1501520	1506960	They're using instead. This is a segment designed to portray refugee children as a danger to america
1507200	1511840	Tucker Carlson tonight crams in five to six of these segments every night in its second half
1512160	1519040	Much like the opening segment the rife with conspiracy theories such as vaccines for military personnel being used to get christians out of the military
1519520	1521520	So by forcing this
1521520	1524960	You get to find out who sincerely believes in god
1525280	1530560	And then you know, you know their names at that point and then you can expel them using the pretext of the covid vaccine
1530880	1533040	The ufo is going after american nukes
1533660	1536880	UFOs interacted with nuclear weapons platforms
1537520	1540960	And either rendered them inoperable or took them offline
1541280	1548000	The content matters less than the general feeling these segments create to distrust any mainstream narrative and to believe any story tucker
1548080	1550080	Is telling you no matter how outlandish
1550640	1552080	All these different topics
1552080	1557040	Particularly the ones that are highlighted in the second half of the show are a means to maintain talking points
1557120	1563360	That aren't necessarily the hot topic of the moment such as critical race theory or affirmative consent on college campuses
1563760	1570960	The vague general threats of non-white people and feminism is kept alive in the minds of viewers whenever stories like these are referenced
1571440	1576880	It also gives them the appearance of legitimacy as if these are ongoing issues that need to be monitored rather than
1577040	1583680	Completely fabricated stories that are simply maintained by a dedicated right-wing media to ensure that the audience doesn't forget that
1584000	1589600	Even though they're not the topic at the moment sometime in the future. This is a group. We might need to scapegoat again
1590080	1593600	So while the big monologues get a lot of the attention including in this video
1593840	1601120	These smaller segments really add up to something truly nefarious the impression that these right-wing narratives are part of a persistent
1601360	1608080	World view one that can be maintained in the minds of viewers through constant attention not through big tentpole stories
1608640	1612880	These segments typically include short interviews often not running for more than two or three minutes
1612960	1616560	They make a perfect backdrop for how tucker carlson presents stories on his show
1616720	1620320	Typically, there are four reasons why a news program might include an interview
1620400	1625040	The first is to provide additional information to a story in his october 21st episode
1625200	1631040	Tucker carlson had a short four-minute segment on a memo issued by attorney general mary garland directing the fbi
1631120	1637920	To investigate the increasing number of violent threats towards school board members over covid related safety requirements fears over critical race theory
1638000	1641200	And other culture war narratives popularized on right-wing media
1641520	1648000	These threats are very real as there are several videos that can be found of school board meetings being disrupted by crowds of angry parents
1648080	1653680	Who use incendiary language including death threats have you yourself received death threats?
1654320	1656080	I have
1656080	1658080	It's terrifying
1658720	1661840	It has an effect on you that you can't really put into words
1662560	1664560	when someone describes
1664880	1666880	the way they want to
1667200	1668800	Come into your home
1668800	1674560	And end your life. Here's another example of parents upset that their kids might be expected to wear masks at school
1680960	1686640	The threats have gotten so bad that the national school boards association has requested help specifically from the fbi
1686880	1691120	But this isn't the part of the story tucker carlson shares on his show according to carlson
1691440	1697120	The controversy here is that garland did not disclose that his son-in-law runs a company called panorama education
1697360	1700720	Which has in a various intent panorama makes a ton of money
1701040	1706400	Pushing racist propaganda the kind that parents are complaining about and how does panorama education do that?
1706720	1710240	By creating surveys for children that measure their school experience
1710720	1713840	He brings on azeron omani to provide the evidence
1714240	1717760	They are asking children from hawaii to mean
1718320	1723600	What what about their sexuality their gender and they're also asking these questions of their parents
1724240	1728960	Not being someone who trusts anybody who wears a shirt that says they aren't a domestic terrorist
1729120	1732400	Which is exactly what a domestic terrorist not wanting to be discovered would do
1732800	1737440	I decided to look into these surveys myself which are helpfully posted on panorama education's website
1737760	1741920	Although there are multiple surveys. I couldn't find a single one asking kids about their sexuality
1742160	1746080	There was one question about gender identity though. It dared to ask a child
1746400	1747600	What is your gender?
1747600	1754560	But other than that there wasn't anything else on sex and gender that I could see there were definitely questions about race and culture though
1754860	1761760	specifically on pages 28 and 29 out of 56 that asks kids in grades 6 through 12 questions such as
1762240	1767200	How often do teachers encourage you to learn about people from different races ethnicities or cultures?
1767440	1772480	And another one is how fairly do adults at your school treat people from different races ethnicities or cultures?
1773040	1778080	Not exactly what I would call nefarious and perfectly fitting in a survey that also asks kids
1778240	1780480	How much support do the adults at your school give you?
1780800	1786080	And how confident are you that you can complete all the work that is assigned in your subject class?
1786560	1788560	Merely asking a question about race is
1788720	1792240	According to nomani indoctrinating kids with critical race theory
1792960	1797760	These types of interviews that add additional information to a story are surprisingly rare though
1798000	1804400	Other interviews you might see on carlson's show are ones that add emotional context such as when a news event impacts a particular group
1804720	1809280	Interviewing someone from that group puts a human face on the issue providing emotional context
1809520	1814720	We'll have some better examples of that later on but the closest version of this I saw on tucker carlson tonight
1814880	1821440	Was when the show discussed the recent dave chappelle netflix special and the backlash over his comments about the trans community
1821680	1827680	Tucker carlson interviewed seth dylan of the babylon b apparently for his response as a comedian
1828320	1832800	Another type of interview you might see on tucker carlson's show is someone with an opposing viewpoint
1833120	1836800	Something that has happened in the past but did not happen on the week
1836800	1841040	I watched and for what I can gather doesn't happen all that often on the show in general
1841280	1846340	Particularly after carlson made the mistake of inviting on dutch historian rutger bregman
1846800	1848480	You might not like it
1848480	1853700	But you're a millionaire funded by billionaires, and that's the reason why you're not talking about these issues
1859040	1864720	Yeah, only now come on you jumped a bandwagon you're all like oh i'm against a globalist the lead blah blah blah
1865600	1867600	It's not very convincing to be honest
1868160	1873120	Honestly if I ever get the chance to be speaking to someone like tucker carlson
1873360	1877520	I wanted to go down exactly like that the type of interview that is by far
1877680	1884000	The most common on tucker carlson tonight is the supposed expert who comes on to affirm everything tucker carlson has been saying
1884320	1886320	Given it the illusion of authority
1886800	1889920	Examples of this are well more than I can fit in this video
1890000	1896240	Here's one I enjoyed though in the october 18th episode tucker had a brief segment about an interview with christopher steel
1896480	1899520	Whose dossier included a number of accusations toward president trump?
1899920	1906400	Perhaps most notably the one where there's apparently a tape in vladimir putin's possession of women who trump hired to pee on a bed
1906560	1908800	That obama had slept in during his trip to russia
1909200	1917920	This segment itself is a rehashed complaint about how the investigation into those supposed russian connections unfairly hamstrung the trump administration's foreign policy
1918160	1921840	And to discuss this carlson brings on cash patel and devon nunez
1922240	1925040	Patel and nunez add very little of substance in their interview
1925120	1927520	They vaguely allude to their own personal issues
1927600	1933120	But the interview lasts less than three minutes giving them in only moments to answer three questions between the two of them
1933520	1938960	Their primary purpose seems to be to agree with tucker about everything and then deliver zingers like this one
1939120	1941760	This guy is no hero. He is no james bond
1942000	1946240	He's inspector gadget on pseudofed and now he's crying for the world to love him
1946560	1950480	Maybe he can get a job with the babylon b these interviews are by far the most common ones
1950480	1951280	I saw during the week
1951280	1956720	I watched this show figures who show up not along with everything tucker carlson said and then make a quick exit
1956960	1960800	Used to cap off a segment as if it now has an authoritative stamp of approval
1961120	1963440	That's what tucker crossing gets from these brief interviews
1963520	1968640	But I imagine the guests themselves get to expose themselves to tucker's massive audience and be presented as a friendly face
1968640	1972400	They can trust because they agree with the same nonsense tucker carlson spreads on his show
1972960	1977200	These are the interviews tucker carlson only conducts on his tucker carlson tonight program
1977520	1980080	There are other sources for people to get their tucker fix
1980720	1982800	And in the case of tucker carlson today
1983200	1987120	It's a long-form interview show that airs on the fox nation streaming service
1987440	1994560	While short segments of these interviews find their way onto tucker carlson tonight the full 50 plus minute interviews are exclusive to fox nation
1995200	1999120	It's here where tucker carlson really digs into the thoughts and opinions of his guests
1999520	2005200	Not like the snippets we see on his fox news show and as you might have guessed tucker's guests also enjoyed agreeing with him
2005520	2006160	To be fair
2006160	2010000	These interviews are absolutely in the first category of the ones I outlined above
2010240	2014640	As these new guests provide lots of new information relative to the narrative being offered though
2014720	2018960	Ultimately these discussions support the same kind of narrative tucker carlson pushes on his main show
2019420	2021280	conservative conspiracy theories
2021280	2026800	Before diving in I should note that while this show typically airs three times a week mondays wednesdays and fridays
2027040	2029440	Tucker carlson took october 22nd off
2029600	2033120	So I only have two episodes to work with though for the sake of my own sanity
2033200	2035360	That was an hour of tucker carlson. I was spared
2035680	2042640	The first of the two interviews was with elbridge colby a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development
2042720	2045540	At the department of defense during the trump administration
2046000	2052240	He's a peculiar guest at least for a friendly interview considering how much of tucker carlson's branding is that he stands up to the elites
2052240	2058800	And insider types of washington when the interview starts tucker tries to establish that colby definitely isn't one of those people
2059200	2064880	If you scour the foreign policy establishment in washington, everyone's either implicated in the disasters
2064880	2070800	We're watching now or there's some kind of crazed neocon ideologue who you would not ask to babysit your children
2071440	2073040	Because they're that untrustworthy
2073040	2079760	So there are very few people whose opinion matters from our perspective on this topic and elbridge colby is one of them
2080000	2085920	Colby having some sense of the show he's on tries to do the same by claiming to have been against the war in iraq
2086480	2090480	But yeah, then i've been working in kind of the national security area for the last 20 years. I entered
2091280	2096560	Dc as a very junior guy right around the time of the iraq, you know fever before the war
2097120	2101520	And i'd say that kind of set me in one direction because I was not not a not a fan
2101600	2103600	I mean my opinion didn't matter at all at that time
2104000	2109440	A quick look at colby's bio reveal that he was part of the coalition provisional authority in iraq in 2003
2109840	2115920	Which was set up by the bush administration to help reshape the country and was also plagued by insider groans from washington
2116080	2123120	Something extensively written about in the 2006 book imperial life in the emerald city inside iraq's green zone by rajiv chandra
2123180	2130320	Sakaran being part of the authority that was reshaping iraq in 2003 is a curious place to be for someone who didn't support the war
2130560	2135280	After his time in iraq colby continued to work in government for a number of years and before joining the trump administration
2135680	2141840	Was part of the center for a new american security a think tank that is partially funded by a number of defense contractors
2141920	2143200	And of course the u.s
2143200	2148960	Government he's on tucker carlson's show to talk about the looming threat of china and how a military response might be the only option
2149120	2156240	In short colby seems like one of the washington insiders that tucker claims to have some deep resentment for but as we learn in this interview
2156720	2163220	Carlson and colby are friends and colby has a book to sell and those things are more important than the facade of tucker's anti-imperialism
2164000	2167600	Much of this interview is colby firing off talking points about the danger of china
2167760	2172960	And he doesn't make a terribly compelling case for his position tucker carlson is very weird in this interview
2173040	2177920	Although the fear mongering about china is on brand his questioning constantly reverts to the talking points
2177920	2181920	He usually has on his show while colby is more willing to give the typical answers
2181920	2188240	You'd see from a washington insider military hawk carlson keeps dredging up some of the bogus culture war narratives in response
2188640	2190400	greatest
2190400	2191760	adversary
2191760	2192960	was russia
2192960	2196000	Under vladimir putin and then biden is elected
2196400	2201440	And the new secretary of defense tells us that the single greatest adversaries in fact within our borders and it's white men
2202000	2204500	the u.s military seems demoralized
2205300	2211700	And its leadership seems completely distracted by irrelevant concerns like white rage and transgenderism
2211700	2218820	That's the outsider's perspective colby deflects a lot of these questions and comments and his tactic seems to be to constantly complement tucker and his show
2219060	2224980	And and I applaud your your focus on this issue and any institution that is above account accountability will fail
2225060	2228420	I mean, I think that's a point that you always stress and I completely agree with it. All the world
2228420	2230340	It's not a terribly interesting interview though
2230340	2237220	I was impressed that even in this dry discussion about american foreign policy tucker carlson still made time to insert some conspiracy theories
2237380	2240180	The japanese bomb for harbor. They did corregator the baton death march
2240180	2246900	They bended nurses in hong kong, etc, etc. And then we got really really angry. Well, that's where roosevelt allowed it, right?
2249700	2251700	He clearly did but whatever okay
2254020	2257780	I should stress that there is no evidence whatsoever that this is true
2258020	2261540	I've linked an article from npr on the subject below if you want to read more about it
2261780	2267220	And he cranks up some real fear on china by asking what one of their nukes would do to an american city modern nuclear weapons
2267220	2268900	Are more powerful
2268900	2274580	What kind of effect would a modern nuclear bomb have on an american population center?
2275060	2277060	Tucker carlson claims to be an anti-interventionist
2277700	2284580	And someone opposed to the american tendency to push itself into conflicts around the world in an effort to expand or maintain its hegemonic influence
2284580	2290900	But in this interview, he is reinforcing the very common talking point something you see in both parties about china being an existential threat
2290980	2293540	And discussing the need for a potential military response
2293700	2298020	It speaks to the game tucker carlson is playing claiming to be a populace speaking for americans
2298260	2305220	Specifically conservative ones who have been ignored by the republican establishment and then turning around and inviting insiders like colby on to have
2305220	2309540	A friendly chat about the american military possibly being in an open conflict with china
2309700	2312580	He does the same thing on tucker carlson tonight when in the week
2312580	2318340	I watched he had on politicians including senator josh holly and governor ron desantis for friendly conversations
2318580	2322900	Tucker carlson can pretend to be firmly against the neo-cons who sent the us into iraq
2323060	2328100	But the figureheads from back then are gone and carlson is happy to play nice with their ideological successors
2328180	2331860	While the branding of populism may be popular he'll happily cozy up to politicians
2331860	2337940	He can convince his audience represent their interests even when they clearly serve a wealthier class. It sure is helpful branding though
2338740	2343460	The other episode of tucker carlson today. I watched was far more on brand on october 20th
2343700	2348980	Tucker welcomed professor dorian abbott to talk about how he had recently been canceled by the woke mob
2349140	2354260	There is some backstory here in 2020 professor abbott a geophysicist at the university of chicago
2354340	2361220	Had some complaints about how diversity equity and inclusion groups were impacting the selection process for graduate student candidates and faculty hires
2361620	2363220	Like all reasonable academics
2363220	2369700	He voiced his concern via a youtube video since taken down which was responded to by a letter signed by over
2369860	2376020	100 students faculty and alumni calling for the university to allow students to withdraw from his classes without penalty
2376260	2381540	Ultimately, the university president sided with abbott and he faced no administrative disciplinary measures
2381860	2384500	Of course, this was not why abbott was brought on to tucker carlson's show
2384740	2390740	Most recently abbott co-wrote an article for newsweek with stanford associate professor evan marinovich once again
2390980	2396180	voicing concern about the impact of diversity equity and inclusion proposing that someone's identity
2396500	2398980	Should have no impact for post-secondary admissions
2399220	2405620	One interesting aspect of this article is that abbott briefly mentions that his proposal would also eliminate legacy admissions as well
2405780	2409620	Which is the practice of a school typically seen in elite ivy league schools
2409780	2413300	Giving students preference if they had a family member who attended the institution
2413540	2415380	While it's lovely to see this be mentioned
2415380	2420900	It seems strange that abbott only mentions it in passing and it comes off as a defense against people calling him racist
2421220	2427700	If anything legacy admissions seem far more unfair as it doesn't just help individuals from racial backgrounds that typically have privilege
2427860	2434020	But it goes that extra step of ensuring that someone from an already wealthy family gets special consideration for a spot at some of the best
2434020	2436740	Schools in the world so it discriminates based on class as well
2437140	2441460	Had abbott come out hard against legacy admissions rather than diversity admissions
2441460	2446100	We might be viewing him entirely different, but it was diversity that was his main target
2446420	2452100	In this article abbott makes no mention of the research that demonstrates how his field of geophysics is hostile towards faculty
2452260	2457540	That aren't white men such as himself and that there are active biases against women and non-white racial groups
2457620	2462980	And that these diversity programs are designed to undercut that bias by breaking down the systems that prevent inclusion
2463140	2470100	He also seems unaware that greater diversity within groups creates more novel hypotheses and actually expand research potential not limit it
2470260	2476980	Professor abbott seems to be under the impression that science faculties are untouched by these biases and exist in realms of pure reason
2477060	2481860	Where facts and evidence are all that matter and a person's identity couldn't possibly impact their work
2482180	2485860	He seems unaware of the academic research that undermined this idea
2486100	2490340	Which is strange because those studies that you saw flash on screen as I was talking about those topics
2490420	2493060	Were all included in the letter complaining about him in 2020
2493220	2497780	It's almost as if he either didn't read them or simply has no interest in acknowledging them
2498180	2503220	That aside what probably drew the most attention in this article is this passage towards the end 90 years ago
2503300	2509380	Germany had the best universities in the world then an ideological regime obsessed with race came to power and drove many of the best
2509460	2514980	Scholars out cutting the faculties and leading to sustained decay that german universities never fully recovered from
2515380	2521060	We should view this as a warning of the consequences of viewing group membership as more important than merit and correct our course
2521060	2522580	Before it is too late
2522580	2526500	If professor abbott is interested in starting a conversation about university admissions
2526580	2531620	I'm not sure comparing diversity equity and inclusion programs to the nazis is a helpful talking point
2531860	2537700	Also, there's something truly grotesque about comparing an effort to help marginalized peoples have better access to higher education
2537860	2540900	With the effort from nazis to keep those groups out of universities
2541060	2546500	It seems more like the exact opposite of what's going on anyone can make grossly reductive points like this
2546580	2551940	I could say the allies in world war ii were just like the nazis because when they were at war both militaries killed soldiers on
2551940	2556260	The opposite side, but that would be a silly comparison that removes all nuance from the discussion
2556740	2558900	But maybe tucker carlson will bring this up in the interview
2559460	2564980	Except no, definitely not we're gonna get stuff like this instead. I don't think i've ever seen a college professor
2565620	2568980	Lay out in such clear and I will say gentle
2570740	2573700	Terms, um as you did what's at stake?
2574020	2580020	I'm not sure a nazi comparison is all that gentle the rest of the interview goes the way you might expect with tucker praising abbott
2580020	2587320	At every turn and some questionable responses being treated as a matter of fact, for example, professor abbott complains about certain ideologies
2587780	2589780	I was uncomfortable with
2589940	2595940	With ideologies that discourage discourse because when you can't speak with the other side
2596420	2601060	The only recourse is violence. Yes, and I saw that playing out in the summer of 2020
2601620	2603220	This is a weird comment
2603220	2608100	Obviously the summer of 2020 refers to the black lives matter demonstrations and in other contexts
2608180	2611940	It could be generously understood as violence in response to an indifferent state
2612100	2616980	That doesn't care about the impact of harsh policing on black communities and won't have that difficult conversation
2617220	2619780	But in the context of this interview with tucker carlson
2619860	2626100	It is more like a condemnation of black lives matter for not wanting to talk about their problems instead of resorting to violence
2626420	2631460	Putting aside the fact that the violence in blm protest has been grossly overstated by the media
2631780	2638020	The only way someone can assume black people don't want to talk about the violence inflicted upon them by the state is to deliberately ignore that conversation
2638260	2643860	Which has been happening for a very long time and has been conveniently ignored by people such as professor abbott
2644100	2649540	It's a great example of how someone like professor abbott was completely ignorant of a problem until it boiled over into a mass movement
2649700	2656020	And even now his response is that we need to think even less about the negative impact of the social construct of race
2656580	2659700	This is not the mindset of someone ready for a conversation
2660020	2662820	Except when it's with tucker carlson in a softball interview
2663220	2667940	The interview muddles along and I feel like I could spend a whole hour on how so many of these answers are wrapped up
2667940	2671140	In gentle language but reveal a deep ignorance of the many issues at play
2671380	2675300	But I want to once again mention how conspiracy theories rear their ugly head
2675380	2680980	Here's professor abbott talking about who's really behind all this diversity stuff. But the problem is that there's a small group
2681700	2683700	That's extremely committed
2684420	2686980	You could call them the woke activist or the social justice
2687220	2691940	Justice activist and they're willing to spend all their time on this stuff and they sort of steamroll
2692260	2695380	And there's some kind of twitter mob that organize in this as well
2696180	2698180	There's there's almost like a playbook
2698580	2701940	To try to take someone down who disagrees with the ideology
2702020	2705380	so the first thing that happens is people go on twitter
2705940	2709380	And they organize and they write lots of messages about the person
2710020	2715940	And the messages say mean things so they'll say this is racist bigoted white supremacists like very
2716420	2723780	Scary sounding things the idea that some people have genuine criticisms of him and are simply responding to his words doesn't seem to occur to him
2723940	2727380	He just waves it away as some kind of conspiracy to advance the fourth rank
2727780	2731540	This interview isn't strictly about the newsweek article getting some criticism though
2731620	2736660	Professor abbott is a victim in all of this because he was about to deliver a guest lecture at mit
2736980	2742900	But was disinvited because of the blowback of that article abbott's response is slightly telling in this interview
2743140	2745780	Uh only the top people in the field are invited
2746180	2749300	To do this you give a large public lecture for like 500 people
2749780	2756660	And then you visit the department at mit about your research about a outreach level of your research
2756980	2758580	It sounds like this lecture was a big deal
2758660	2760900	But what is this outreach level comment?
2761060	2765940	It turns out that this lecture at mit was intended not strictly for faculty or university students
2766020	2768020	But also for high school students
2768420	2774660	robert vander hilst head of mit's earth atmospheric and planetary sciences department clarified in a statement
2774980	2778180	The carlson lecture isn't a scientific talk for fellow scientists
2778420	2784900	It has a very specific format and public outreach component seeking to build public understanding of climate science and to inspire and engage with
2784900	2790980	Area high school students. We felt that with the current distractions. We would not be in a position to hold an effective outreach event
2791140	2795460	I made this decision at my discretion after consulting with faculty and students in the department
2795700	2801540	And knowing that some might mistake it as an affront on academic freedom a characterization. I do not agree with though
2801540	2808900	This particular lecture was cancelled mit did invite professor abbott to give another lecture this one instead with faculty and university students
2809300	2813860	This isn't a case of someone being cancelled. It's a case of someone's lecture being rescheduled
2814020	2817860	But that's not the narrative we see on tucker carlson's show. It's a way to cripple someone's
2818420	2822180	A scientific career and put pressure on them not to speak out
2822340	2827460	I don't know how speaking to high school students would mean more for his career than presenting his research to practicing academics
2827780	2834020	But there's one more aspect of this interview that was very informative after abbott had that letter written about him in 2020
2834100	2838340	The minor controversy that followed drew the attention of many supposed free speech groups
2838660	2843780	Apparently abbott suddenly found himself networking with a number of different groups and individuals ready to champion his cause
2844100	2848420	That the worst thing that happened to him was a letter didn't matter. They welcomed him into their fold
2848740	2854420	I was already a part of the heterodox academy. I got involved with fire foundation for individual rights and education
2854500	2859460	I I met with some of the leadership at acta the american council of trustees and alumni
2860020	2865140	I started networking and trying to understand what had happened and how I can be effective
2865620	2871700	He unironically calls this a group of classical liberals and even mentions how they set up a little safe space for themselves
2871940	2873940	They have controversial speakers
2874340	2880180	And it's the faculty. It's only faculty who attend by invitation only so everyone can trust who's there
2880740	2882660	And as is typical with these conversations
2882660	2886580	We see tucker carlson and professor abbott pat themselves on the back for having a conversation
2886900	2892820	Even though they might disagree on some stuff and you speaking to me is not the same as ratifying all of my different
2892900	2898100	Exactly crazy opinions which you may disagree with but that's not the point if you didn't talk to everyone you disagreed with something on
2898180	2899700	You wouldn't talk to anyone, right?
2899700	2906180	It's like this program turned into an episode of the ruben report where the hapless dave ruben happily nods along with whatever right-wing
2906260	2908420	Goal he's invited onto his show only in this case
2908500	2914260	It's a bit more sophisticated with tucker carlson bringing on a sympathetic face to advance similar talking points
2914340	2920420	And he's actually capable of marching to the same beat alongside with them instead of vacuously nodding his head like dave ruben
2920740	2925460	I hate how hollow the whole comment about how they can disagree about things but still talk to one another
2925700	2930020	At no point in this interview did the two of them have any sort of meaningful disagreement about anything
2930180	2933940	It's the same line dave ruben would have about not having to agree with all his guests
2934100	2939460	If there is no active airing of these disagreements in this case tucker carlson doesn't even bring them up
2939940	2946180	Then this is just platforming ideas with no pushback. The invisible disagreements don't matter because they're not talking about them
2946340	2949860	These are two people who agree about everything they're discussing in this interview
2950100	2955300	Their disagreements could be about fundamental policy issues or what kind of potato chip they like to eat
2955460	2957460	It doesn't matter. We don't see it
2957780	2961300	Professor abbott not only faced the horror of having his mit lecture rescheduled
2961300	2966500	He was also rewarded with an additional lecture at princeton, which so far has over 10 000 viewers registered
2966580	2970020	Which is a lot more than the 500 he expected at his first mit lecture
2970180	2976020	The interview ends on an optimistic note that really reinforces the idea that this man has in no meaningful way been cancelled
2976340	2980420	That there is an entire apparatus ready to make him the next darling of the free speech crowd
2980580	2985220	He might make the rounds on exclusively right-wing shows talking about the left being out of control
2985300	2990180	And if he plays his car, right maybe he'll get a job at the blaze or maybe we'll never hear about this guy again
2990340	2996900	Because to be perfectly honest guys like this have limited appeal their tools to talk about the phantom menace of cancel culture
2996980	3000020	It's really just the media savvy ones who can parlay that into a career
3000260	3002260	I don't know if this guy has it in him for that
3002260	3005620	Remember when I said about how I got lucky that tucker took friday off
3006020	3010980	Well that luck ran out when I learned that he also dropped an extra bit of content onto fox nation
3010980	3018180	One of his monthly tucker carlson originals this one titled blown away the people versus wind power as you might have guessed
3018260	3025700	It's about how wind power is a threat to america this 25 minute special which calls itself a documentary is so thin and cheesy
3025780	3027620	I struggle to take it seriously
3027620	3033060	It's lavishly produced and leans very heavily on interviews that give emotional context to the supposed threat of wind power
3033220	3035300	That's the second type of interview. I mentioned above
3035780	3042420	The vast majority of subjects are either regular people or activists upset that wind turbines have been or are being built near them
3042660	3046340	Here's an example people who look at some of these wind proposals
3046580	3049620	Figure out quickly that one of the reasons their community is being targeted
3049860	3052740	Is it's poor and they're perceived as being desperate for revenue
3052820	3057220	This sure seems like a case of the little guy being troubled by big business. So let's see who we meet first
3057780	3064180	The consequence of this affluent nimbyism is that the high cost of green energy falls on poorer places
3064420	3067860	Places like rural, iowa home to mike and tanya lamb
3068340	3070500	I'm not sure what property values are like in iowa
3070580	3075380	But there is no way that anyone living in that home is one of the poorer and desperate described earlier
3075780	3079300	Tanya lamb who lives in the house literally calls it her dream home
3079460	3080660	It is our dream home
3080660	3084660	The special is a collection of shots of windmills breaking up otherwise flat scenery
3084660	3088100	And if you're guessing many of these complaints about windmills is that they will ruin the view
3088580	3090580	You'd be right in 2019
3091140	3093860	The wind farms came this is our view from our dinner table
3094820	3098980	Turbines every direction and you know, we get a lot of shadow flicker in here, too
3099140	3104420	I mean just imagine being in a room and someone's turning the light switch on and off on and off on and off
3104820	3109140	I mean and this it's in the middle of the day. Well, it's actually the morning is when it's the worst and
3110020	3112020	It I mean it almost makes you dizzy
3112020	3115860	There are some other assorted complaints like the wind turbine creates a lot of noise
3116020	3122580	And the only time we hear noise from a turbine is when we get one of these weird close-ups where audio is almost certainly being manipulated
3122980	3124980	Our peaceful country living
3126260	3131380	That isn't to say that these things are completely silent and I suppose whatever noise might be generated is annoying
3131620	3133620	Anyone can find plenty of these complaints online
3133700	3138900	But a problem with this criticism is that it's couched in the idea that these wind turbines are in rural areas
3138980	3144340	Because people in cities don't want the burden that comes with building them. That is supposedly the noise they create
3144820	3150340	As someone who currently lives in a city that is one of the most ridiculous things i've ever heard as I type this
3150660	3154660	I can hear a plane flying overhead as it approaches the city's airport 30 minutes ago
3154660	3157380	There was a siren as an ambulance drove by and a few days ago
3157460	3161700	I spent most of the day listening to a construction crew repair a water main down the street for me
3162020	3165860	We get noise in the city the occasional whooshing noise would not be a big deal
3166260	3171380	The reason you don't see a lot of wind turbines in cities is because they're more effective in wide open spaces
3171540	3176020	Such as coastal areas or open planes if you live somewhere like a flat part of iowa
3176100	3178420	That's what makes it an attractive spot for a wind turbine
3178820	3182100	When is it nearly strong enough when the turbine is surrounded by buildings?
3182980	3190340	We get some laughable complaints about how subsidies are used to create wind farms wind farms only exist because they're heavily subsidized by
3190640	3197220	Politicians with your money. They wouldn't exist. Otherwise, there's no mention at all of subsidies that go towards fossil fuel companies
3197620	3199620	This is where the special really drops the ball
3199780	3206680	Any discussion about energy needs would of course mention that there is always a cost associated with them both financial and environmental
3207140	3209140	And while wind turbines have one
3209200	3212420	Comparatively their cost is lower than that of fossil fuels
3212660	3218900	An article in nature describes the amount of spent on fossil fuel subsidies as more than triple what is spent on renewables like wind energy
3219060	3222580	It's irresponsible to discuss these subsidies without presenting that context
3222740	3227860	But it certainly doesn't end there what really annoyed me in the specials when it got personal and tucker tried to use the birds
3227940	3235060	To push his agenda from the federal government and other studies that show that hundreds of thousands of birds are killed every year
3235540	3239460	By wind turbines again a comparison needs to be made here every year
3239700	3243380	Far more birds are killed by power lines buildings and cats than wind turbines
3243460	3247700	And if we're going to reduce this discussion to energy production fossil fuels are driving climate change
3247780	3254660	Which will and does have a dramatic impact on bird habitats devastating populations and threatening entire species with extinction
3255060	3258340	This isn't to say that we shouldn't consider birds when building windmills
3258500	3261300	Particularly species that are more likely to be impacted by them
3261460	3265860	And this can be addressed by considering migration patterns and habitats when it comes to placing windmills
3265940	3269860	But climate change is by far the bigger threat and if someone truly cares about the birds
3270020	3273300	Fossil fuels are a much greater danger to birds than windmills
3273460	3275460	There is very little to comment on in this special
3275620	3280420	We spend some time with a fisherman worried about his business failing because of wind turbines that haven't been built yet
3280420	3286900	And activists who say that wind turbines would mean new york has changed its political composition this state. It's not a democracy
3286980	3293380	It's the socialist republic. Oh, it might be fun to just dunk on these people providing evidence that building windmills around water
3293540	3296500	Typically has no meaningful impact on fish populations
3296660	3301780	Or when this guy holds up a map to demonstrate that new york state would never build wind turbines near new york city
3301940	3308100	Is completely contradicted by the fact that there is the empire wind project an offshore wind farm being built right next to new york city
3308260	3310260	That is planned for completion in 2026
3310720	3314020	Ultimately, this is the smallest of potatoes being presented
3314180	3321060	The previous tucker carlson original special to air was about ufos if you're in a series that includes a special about the dangers of ufos
3321380	3322740	I hate to break it to you
3322740	3324740	But you're not on a serious program
3325060	3329300	And so we come to the end of our odyssey through the many programs of tucker carlson
3329380	3335060	And this was all from a single week what I found most surprising about this venture was how diverse tucker's talking points were
3335140	3339940	He truly had something for everyone. He had conspiracy theories of all flavors. He had racism
3340020	3344600	He had sexism transphobia anti-semitism neo-con republicanism and religiosity
3345300	3351700	Part of my research included trips to the facebook page for tucker carlson tonight where clips of the opening monologues were often shared
3351780	3353780	And the comments were completely uninteresting
3354180	3359060	Some I guess i'll call them highlights include if we the people want to keep our freedom
3359300	3361780	We must stand up and not submit to the mandates
3362100	3363300	We must push back
3363300	3368420	We must ask the one and only true god to have mercy on us and shine the light of truth on the evil
3368420	3373540	Being played out right in front of us. No wonder the left hates tucker carlson. He mops the floor with them
3374340	3376340	every single night
3376820	3378580	With the exception of the colon pal monologue
3378580	3383380	Which sparked a bit of debate between those who respect his position and those who hate his disapproval of donald trump
3383460	3387140	The comments are mostly filled with screeds against democrats and adulation for tucker
3387380	3390820	No one is watching the show critically. They're coming here to have their biases served
3391380	3396340	This observation I imagine will shock no one nor will my debunking of tucker carlson's content
3396500	3400580	His program has long been understood as a pack of lies used to push far-right talking points
3400660	3406420	But by washing it for a week what surprised me was how artificial it all felt so obviously rehearsed. Here's a quick example
3406660	3411140	Like white privilege family privilege is an unacknowledged and unearned benefit
3412800	3414900	Instantiated if that's even a word these people are so stupid
3414900	3421940	Instantiated in u.s. Law's policies and practices just right like an american for the benefit of tucker according to oxford
3422640	3428900	Instantiated means to represent as or by an instance. It's a little examples like these that exemplify or
3429680	3436100	Instantiate the somewhat folksy attitude tucker presents on a show much like the rolled up sleeves and wood paneling on his today program
3436180	3439620	Or the photo ops he does in his definitely real and not at all staged
3439620	3445540	Cabinsque room tucker carlson's audience have bought into this fiction of him being a man of the people even though he comes from
3445540	3448260	A wealthy background and continues to make millions on fox news
3448420	3452340	pushing hollow narratives designed to misinform and distract his audience from the fact that he
3452500	3455540	And people like him are actively working against their interests
3455700	3459860	It speaks to the problem of personalities in political commentary people aren't tuning in for the news
3459940	3461460	They're tuning in to see tucker
3461460	3465140	He gives them a version of the world they want to believe in so they outsource their thinking to him
3465140	3468340	And he shapes the news of the day into a version that confirms their biases
3468660	3475060	Whether it's distracting them with bogus stories about menacing refugee children or misinforming them about vaccines that will save their lives
3475220	3481060	The objective is to rile people up and make them angry with empty narratives and then direct them towards republican politicians
3481140	3485940	Will devote more money to the military and undermine projects that might benefit the american people
3486420	3492260	The interview with retcord bragman summed it up perfectly when he called tucker carlson a millionaire working for billionaires
3492420	3498340	And that is why that segment never saw the light of day on tucker's show and we only have evidence since bragman recorded it himself
3498660	3503780	Tucker carlson needs that facade to keep this whole thing going. It's not about standing up to the powerful elites
3503860	3508020	It's about distracting the people with nonsense so they don't notice those same elites exploiting them
3508340	3511720	That is what tucker carlson does with his programming each week
3514740	3519300	This one was quite a ride tucker carlson's show really spins your head around
3519620	3524980	Just constantly firing off information at you daring you to even try and understand it
3525140	3530020	If I wanted to debunk every claim he made on his show this video would have been like five or six hours
3530340	3536900	It's the eternal problem of debunking videos where the truth takes so much longer to explain than the lie that is repeated so easily
