1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,040
We've all made mistakes in our lives, done things we look back on with regret,

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,000
maybe wishing there was some kind of way of making it right.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
My Name is Earl takes an average scumbag and gives him a mission to do just that,

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,840
and in turn gives us a blueprint on how to make amends for wrongdoing

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,920
and making the world a better place in the process.

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
Running for a mere four seasons, My Name is Earl was a smash hit when it debuted,

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
only to be unceremoniously cancelled after its fourth season.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,840
In that short time, it won several awards and grew a small cult following.

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,080
Earl Hickey and his journey of redemption through the cartoonish role of Camden County

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,240
gave audiences a crash course in karma, revealing the simplicity of doing good.

11
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,360
And it gave us one of the greatest mustaches in TV history.

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,400
The story of My Name is Earl begins with Greg Garcia.

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,200
Before creating the series, Garcia had written for shows such as Family Matters and On Our Own.

14
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,400
He then went on to co-create the sitcom Yes, Dear for CBS.

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,080
Garcia came up with an idea for a show starring a less than savory character

16
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,480
trying to make up for all the wrong he had done in his life,

17
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
partially inspired by parts of Garcia's own personal history.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,680
My father, or stepfather, is named Earl.

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,760
He wasn't the best guy in the world.

20
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,440
He was somewhat of a crook.

21
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:14,400
I don't think he was as bad as some of the things Earl has done,

22
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,480
but he kind of saw the light and started to change his ways

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,800
and didn't officially make a list.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,040
But he went around and kind of made up for some of the things he's done

25
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,720
and he's continuing to do that.

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,160
So he really inspired me.

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,760
Garcia pitched the show to Fox, thinking it would be a good fit for the network,

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,320
but they ultimately passed on the pilot's script.

29
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,160
That script found its way to NBC,

30
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,680
and while they initially wanted Garcia to create a whole new series for them,

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,680
he suggested that instead they take the existing script and turn it into a series.

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,600
And so My Name is Earl was born.

33
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,480
Early on, director Mark Buckland was attached to the project

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,880
and became a big part of the look of the series.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,880
He and Garcia were on the same page about wanting My Name is Earl to look cinematic.

36
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,080
We just said, you know, this thing really should look like a movie every week.

37
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,640
For the show to move forward, it had to assemble the right cast

38
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,000
and the crucial first step was finding the right person to play Earl.

39
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,960
Partially because NBC really wanted him on their network,

40
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,440
Jason Lee was an early favorite to play Earl.

41
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,120
Lee had mostly worked in movies at this point and back in 2005,

42
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,040
it was a lot less common to see actors moving from the big screen to the small one.

43
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,000
The strength of the pilot's script convinced Lee to take the part.

44
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
This is something that I would see in a film if done right.

45
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,200
And if done right, it would be up my alley,

46
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,920
the kind of movie I would want to be and I would want to watch.

47
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,320
Earl was a former dirtbag turned good guy and Lee brought an easy charm to the character

48
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,560
that made the audience root for him on his journey.

49
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,400
Lee also had the brilliant idea of giving Earl his signature mustache.

50
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,160
And he said, you know what, he goes, I look really funny with a mustache.

51
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,760
He goes, trust me, a mustache would be hilarious.

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,760
And he was right.

53
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,880
The iconic look was originally something they had to fight the network on,

54
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,920
but for all our sake, sanity eventually prevailed and Earl Hickey was born.

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,520
You got great boobs, Peggy.

56
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,240
Her name was not Peggy.

57
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,480
Ethan Suppley was in early consideration for the role of Randy Hickey, Earl's brother.

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,640
Although Lee and Suppley had been friends for a while,

59
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,880
having worked on a number of projects over the years,

60
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,840
that wasn't how Suppley ended up in consideration for the role.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,480
And the story and the characters were hysterical.

62
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,280
My wife is a manager and she said, what the hell are you reading?

63
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,360
And I said, I'm reading My Name is Earl.

64
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
And she said, that's Jason Shell.

65
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,480
And I was like, what?

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,600
It was a complete surprise to Suppley when he found out that he was in the running for

67
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,160
a series starring his longtime friend and their onscreen chemistry made for an easy fit.

68
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,240
Randy is a man of many strange talents and a unique perspective.

69
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,960
Although not the most intellectually gifted of people,

70
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,400
he does have a good heart and remains Earl's most loyal friend.

71
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,280
Randy, those are poison.

72
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,280
How poison?

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,080
The role of Joy, Earl's ex-wife, very quickly went to Jamie Pressley.

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,280
According to Pressley, it was basically given to her at the audition.

75
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
I went in there like, so when do we start shooting?

76
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,360
It's hard to imagine anyone else as the hard as nails, yet somehow charming trailer park terror.

77
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,440
Although Joy and Earl didn't have the best marriage,

78
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,000
they did manage to become friends after it ended.

79
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,840
At least, they did eventually.

80
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,400
You are not the one standing with the freshly broken bottle now, are you?

81
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,960
Well, this will still hurt if I hit you with it.

82
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,440
Eddie Steeples caught the eye of Greg Garcia after his appearance in a number of commercials,

83
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,480
specifically his role as the rubber band man in a series of Office Max ad spots.

84
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,720
Steeples played Darnell Turner, also known as Harry Monroe, more on that later,

85
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,040
and affectionately nicknamed Crabman.

86
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,160
Darnell is Joy's love interest and eventual new husband.

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,120
The perpetual face of chill, Darnell is the yin to her yang, though his calm demeanor

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,800
hides a mysterious past.

89
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,520
Hi, Earl.

90
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,480
Hey, Crabman.

91
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,200
Joy wanted me to bring you these poison cookies.

92
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,240
Huh?

93
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,280
I wasn't gonna get involved, but now she got me delivering poison.

94
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,640
Just don't sing right.

95
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,160
The last person to join the principal cast was Nadine Velasquez, playing Catalina Arruca,

96
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
the maid in the motel Earl and Randy live in.

97
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,840
Velasquez actually gave up being part of the series Prison Break,

98
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,040
where she would have played the character Maricruz Delgado,

99
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,680
so she could instead be a part of My Name is Earl.

100
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Catalina brings a bit of flavor to the cast, offering a friend to support Earl and Randy,

101
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,600
while also being a foil to Joy.

102
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,160
There you go.

103
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,960
Now, if you do it to the other hand, I want to take you to my church

104
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,480
so I can watch all the old ladies cry.

105
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,000
When the show came together, it tested surprisingly well with audiences,

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,520
in spite of the fact that its single-camera style was a relatively new thing

107
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
for networks that come at the time.

108
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,920
Those early positive signs even led NBC to give out advanced previews of the pilot

109
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,440
to people via a CD-ROM that was inserted into magazines,

110
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,680
something that is absolutely a relic of the era this show came from.

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,400
My Name is Earl premiered on a Tuesday night and brought with it

112
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,920
some high hopes that it would be a hit, and it was an instant success.

113
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,080
Straight from Carson Daly's lips to my morphine-laced ear.

114
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,280
Debuting on Tuesday, September 20th, 2005, with an episode titled

115
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,320
Pilot, My Name is Earl waved hello to the world.

116
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,600
The opening minutes of the show establish the premise in short order.

117
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Earl is not a good guy.

118
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,320
Sort of shifty-looking fella who buys a pack of smokes,

119
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,280
a couple lotto scratchers, and a tall boy at 10 in the morning.

120
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,080
He's married to a woman who got him drunk enough to marry her,

121
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,200
even though she was six months pregnant with another man's child.

122
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:26,080
Joy didn't remember much about the boy's real father,

123
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,440
except that he drove a Ford.

124
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,760
So we named him Dodge.

125
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,920
A year later, she gave birth to another son,

126
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,720
though Earl suspects this one wasn't his either.

127
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,440
There he was.

128
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,000
Earl Jr.

129
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,160
Earl's life changes forever, though, when he wins $100,000 in the lotto,

130
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,880
and he's then hit by a car and loses the scratcher.

131
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,680
Joy soon leaves Earl for Darnell, the real father of her second son,

132
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,840
and while Earl is stuck in a hospital bed wondering why his life is so miserable,

133
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,720
Earl learns about a little thing called karma.

134
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
You do good things, and good things happen to you.

135
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,960
You do bad things, and they'll come back to haunt you.

136
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,480
Karma.

137
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:08,960
Karma.

138
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,720
There it was.

139
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,800
Having been tricked out of the trailer by Joy, Earl and Randy are living at a motel.

140
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,400
They make a new friend in Catalina, and Earl announces his new plan in life,

141
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,560
to make a list of every person he's wronged and then try to somehow make it up to them.

142
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
I almost died because something good happened to me that I didn't deserve.

143
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,760
That karma stuff is gonna kill me unless I make up for everything on that list.

144
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,000
As if karma is smiling down on him, the lottery scratcher returns,

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,520
and Earl has $100,000 he can use to fund his new quest to make all his wrongs right.

146
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,320
The rest of the episode has Earl going on his first task,

147
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,880
making amends with one of his former bullying victims, Kenny, played by Greg Binkley.

148
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:51,360
He decides for this one he needs to get Kenny laid, only Kenny has a secret.

149
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,800
I live in a small town, and I've never been face to face with a gay before.

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:03,040
This is where the show starts to get more interesting.

151
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,640
If all Earl was doing in this series was traveling around doing good deeds,

152
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
it wouldn't be much of a show.

153
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,640
From the pilot, we're getting a few key elements about what makes this series so special.

154
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:17,760
Earl isn't just here to help Kenny, he has to help himself by getting past his own homophobia.

155
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,680
To help get Kenny out of the closet, Earl takes him to a gay bar,

156
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,960
and the experience is so transformative for Kenny that he lets Earl know he can cross him off his list.

157
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,840
The one man I was the most scared of in my whole life has accepted me as I am.

158
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,000
You took away my confidence, but today you gave it back.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,680
This episode offered a very lovely portrait of how to make amends to a person.

160
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,480
It begins with Earl realizing he's done something wrong.

161
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,240
He then goes to make amends.

162
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,320
He learns about who his victim is as a person,

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,520
and what unique way he can offer some form of restitution.

164
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,080
And then his victim tells Earl when he's done enough.

165
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,080
It's a form of justice that focuses on restitution towards the wrong party

166
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,920
rather than punishing the aggressor.

167
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,880
And there were so many other important facts established in the pilot.

168
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,560
Earl finding the lottery ticket he lost, and still sticking with his list,

169
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,920
establishes that this mission is something Earl is going to be on for a while.

170
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,600
He's not just doing it for the sake of getting that one lottery ticket back.

171
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,280
And by helping someone else, Earl also helps make himself a better person,

172
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,600
overcoming the homophobia of his past self.

173
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,360
Something we'll see in later episodes is Kenny coming to Earl's help when he needs it in the

174
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,440
future as the series reveals over time, while Earl views it as a personal mission,

175
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,560
this journey has consequences for all of Camden.

176
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,840
Earl is a flawed guide, but he's made lovable by wanting to do better.

177
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,440
He's also limited in that he's not suddenly a master of ethical living.

178
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,480
But this doesn't somehow stop him from being a decent person.

179
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,000
Karma is a simple, but very effective way of living a better life.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,400
Something anyone can take on, even Earl.

181
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,240
The pilot was a huge hit, being watched by nearly 15 million people.

182
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,840
A fun fact about this episode is that it also includes an appearance by the series creator,

183
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,800
Greg Garcia.

184
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,200
He's the guy Randy dances with at the gay bar.

185
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
Over the years, there would be a number of cameos like this from Garcia and other members

186
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,240
of the staff on the show.

187
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
But this one was particularly fun.

188
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,160
In the DVD set for the first season, there was also an alternate version of the pilot,

189
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,840
Bad Karma, that was included.

190
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:18,640
Instead of Carson Daly, Earl listens to Stewie Griffin from Family Guy go on a short rant,

191
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,080
and takes this to heart instead.

192
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:24,560
So instead of making a list of people he's wronged, Earl makes a list of vengeance and

193
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:45,600
decides to be even worse than he had been before.

194
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:50,200
Much of the pilot's events are inverted, like Earl attacking Joy and Darnell instead

195
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,160
of Joy attacking him when she finds out he won the lottery.

196
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:57,160
And Earl tries to manipulate Kenny, thinking that he's straight, into having sex with

197
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,320
a prostitute who has a penis.

198
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,800
The episode ends with Earl being hit by a car, and this time, a very upset Joy and Darnell,

199
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,140
left bald by Earl's attack, decide to finish him off for good, leaving Randy to become

200
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:12,280
the star of the series.

201
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:16,320
This episode is a cute little extra, and it's also notable for being the one time we see

202
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,760
Jason Lee playing Earl with a fake mustache and sideburns.

203
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,840
Absolutely criminal.

204
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:29,280
Earl's growth can be summarized very easily as a simple man making himself and his community

205
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,000
better through good deeds.

206
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,320
In the second episode, quit smoking.

207
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,240
Earl tries to make up for getting his friend Donnie arrested.

208
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,040
Only Donnie found religion in jail, and he forgives Earl.

209
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,880
But Donnie wasn't the only victim, and Earl finds that he needs to make up for the two

210
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,440
years Donnie's mother lost with her son.

211
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,960
So to make things square, he helps Donnie's mother quit smoking so she'll have some

212
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:58,720
extra time with him.

213
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,360
While smoking is likely not as easy to quit as the montage makes it to be, or at least

214
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,080
give quitting a fighting chance like the montage suggests, this little story reflects how Earl

215
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,480
realizes his actions have hurt people outside of his list.

216
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,520
The bad Earl did often spilled out and had a greater impact than he thought, but the

217
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,160
same is true of the good.

218
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,800
This list item helped Earl get healthier and Donnie and his mother have more time to

219
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,920
spend together.

220
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,880
Three people helped with one good deed.

221
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,880
The important lesson, and one we see throughout the series, is that everyone and everything

222
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:32,360
is connected to something else, and one good deed or one bad deed could ripple out to affect

223
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,840
an entire community.

224
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,320
By choosing to do good instead of bad, this is how Earl is making his community a better

225
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,320
place.

226
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,760
There's also a wonderful feedback loop that shows us that, by doing good and becoming

227
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,480
a better person, Earl is able to take on more challenging tasks and having an increased

228
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,400
impact in his community.

229
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,480
Earl is effectively becoming a greater force for change as the series progresses, and Earl's

230
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,940
commitment to karma is tested through an increasingly heavy load.

231
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,940
This is how Earl makes himself better.

232
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:03,080
In the season one finale, number one, Earl attempts to cross off the first thing on his

233
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,080
list.

234
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,080
It was the last bad thing he ever did before getting hit by a car, still ten dollars from

235
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:11,920
a guy at a convenience store, only he finds out that that guy was going to use ten dollars

236
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,680
to buy the winning lottery ticket that Earl bought instead, so Earl has to give the guy

237
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,320
his lottery money.

238
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:21,720
Having lost his lottery winnings, Earl puts his faith in karma to care for him and Randy,

239
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:32,680
and that often takes the shape of his friends helping him out.

240
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,080
Even with his money gone, Earl keeps working on the list.

241
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:40,680
Then he loses his car, and he keeps working on the list, and it even looks like he might

242
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:45,040
be losing Randy, and he still keeps on working on the list.

243
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,400
He learns that the man Earl originally stole that ten dollars from was ruined by the lottery

244
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:56,240
winnings.

245
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:01,440
There's an almost mystical quality to the experience, as if this money can only be used

246
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
to do good for others.

247
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,520
This episode also raised the important point of how sometimes doing good can feel like

248
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:12,400
you're going backwards, but if you stay on track, things will work out, and friends

249
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,000
can help you along the way.

250
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:27,600
The audio commentary reflected this very important part of the series.

251
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,880
Earl at the beginning of the season likely would have bailed the moment his money vanished

252
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,560
and gone back to his thieving ways, but doing good deeds for a year has changed him.

253
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:39,120
It's not just about the reward, but also the experience.

254
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,760
He still believes karma will make his life better, but not in the way he might have at

255
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,760
the beginning.

256
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,800
Earl's capacity to do good and the power of good deeds are a major force driving him

257
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,560
forward throughout the seasons.

258
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:53,320
What Earl can do for others expands as more people do good alongside him.

259
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,440
Earl's approach to doing good deeds is never very complicated.

260
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,360
He's aware that he's a work in progress and that by doing good, he's working on

261
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,080
making himself better, as perhaps best summed up at the end of the season one episode titled

262
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:16,640
The Professor.

263
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,480
How can you not root for this guy?

264
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,920
These little moments are never very complicated and that's part of Earl's charm.

265
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,680
He's a simple guy and doing good doesn't have to be a complicated thing.

266
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,600
In the season two episode, Rob to Stoner Blind, Earl is faced with a deep dilemma when Woody,

267
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:44,960
played by Christian Slater, teaches him about climate change.

268
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,800
As Earl realizes this is going to require him to do a lot more than change his personal

269
00:15:48,800 --> 00:16:01,480
habits, he starts to feel overwhelmed by the problem.

270
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:07,080
Climate change is beyond the power of a former thief on a mission to underdo his wrongdoings.

271
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:11,000
The episode saying Earl just needs to repay the earth in a small way is a decent enough

272
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
message.

273
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,960
But what rings particularly true here is that, for Earl, thinking on some kind of grand scale

274
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,480
to fix the planet is not something he needs to do.

275
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,320
What we're learning here is that, instead of being bogged down in grand ethical debates

276
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,160
on how we live our lives and how it impacts every other organism on the planet, Earl can

277
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:34,360
do good just by following his list and by doing that, it reveals how doing good is really

278
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,760
a simple thing.

279
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:38,140
That's another theme that runs through the series.

280
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:43,040
It's not that worrying about big problems is a bad thing, it's that doing good doesn't

281
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,280
require exclusively fixating on those heavier burdens.

282
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:50,800
As long as someone is still making some kind of small step to help with those bigger problems

283
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,560
and spending the rest of their time doing good in other, more immediate ways.

284
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:59,320
The series isn't about wrestling with massive ethical conundrums.

285
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:03,880
For instance, is it more moral to adopt a stray cat or donate your time to help a soup

286
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,880
kitchen?

287
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,820
The answer in this series is that it's not an either or question.

288
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:11,160
You do the one that makes the most sense to you.

289
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:14,000
It's the doing that matters the most.

290
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,880
In the season 4 episode Sweet Johnny, we see a great example of that when Earl tries

291
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:22,880
to make amends with a local stuntman named Sweet Johnny, played by David Arquette, only

292
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,460
to learn that Sweet Johnny has a brain injury that prevents him from forming new memories.

293
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:31,540
So Earl could never really make up for the fact that he slept with Sweet Johnny's girlfriend.

294
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:35,800
Though he keeps trying, eventually Earl realizes why he's trying so hard.

295
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,600
I was really only trying to make me feel better by crossing Johnny off the list.

296
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,380
For the first time since I started doing my list, I wasn't going to be able to cross

297
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
somebody off.

298
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,260
I was going to have to just let it nag at me.

299
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,340
But since Johnny was never going to remember, it felt right that someone will never forget.

300
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:56,020
A guilty conscience is not something that is always a thing you can get rid of, but

301
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,700
good deeds are always something a person can do.

302
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,820
It may not make things right, but it can serve as a permanent reminder to be a better person.

303
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:06,540
It's a very deep lesson for such a simple guy, and it's how the whole process of doing

304
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,820
good shows the evolution of Earl.

305
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,740
He becomes a better person and learns about the limitations of those good works, and even

306
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,420
though he can't make everything right, that's no excuse not to do the good he can.

307
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,220
And importantly, with Earl learning these lessons, it reveals that anyone can learn

308
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,540
them alongside him.

309
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:27,380
Although Earl is trying to be a better person, what's inescapable is that he isn't quite

310
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:31,140
there yet, and that often gets revealed in some less than enlightened moments throughout

311
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,180
the series.

312
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:36,020
The aforementioned homophobia from the pilot is a great example because it not only highlights

313
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:39,060
a problem of Earl's, but also how he corrects it.

314
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:43,620
It was put succinctly by Jamie Pressley in the audio commentary for the season one episode,

315
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,620
White Lie Christmas.

316
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:47,500
That's what I love about our show though, is that it's politically incorrect and then

317
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
it corrects itself.

318
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,060
In a really twisted way.

319
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,860
In a really twisted way.

320
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,540
Even though the show's humor bordered on the offensive at times, it didn't get a lot

321
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,580
of pushback from the audience.

322
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,180
In another audio commentary, this time in the season one episode, Oh Karma Where Art

323
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,980
Thou, we hear how that that's why the show didn't get as much anger directed towards

324
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:08,500
it for its more offensive moments.

325
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:28,340
The show on occasion also has its cake and eats it too by having Earl do all sorts of

326
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:33,460
horrible things in extended flashback sequences, sometimes nearly lasting the whole episode,

327
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,980
to then see him making up for it in the present.

328
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:38,620
This makes the whole journey feel more real.

329
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:42,540
Rather than everything take place within the narrow timeframe of a few days, like on most

330
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,620
other sitcoms, going back several years with numerous flashbacks creates a more realistic

331
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:52,340
length of time for Earl to grow and the audience has been seeing that the whole time, since

332
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:56,820
that's the premise of the series, so they can be a bit more forgiving of Earl in the

333
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:57,820
past.

334
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:01,660
Or even people in the present who have yet to have undergone Earl's positive influence

335
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,260
or gone on his journey.

336
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,020
The passage of time needed to improve as a person feels particularly real when it comes

337
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:12,140
to how Earl begins to mend his relationship with his father, Carl, played by Bo Bridges.

338
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,940
When we first see them together, shortly after Earl has started his list in the episode,

339
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:21,820
Cost Dad the Election, we can see what a lifetime of Earl's bad behavior has done to the relationship.

340
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:31,780
Earl is trying to convince his dad to run for mayor after Earl ruined his last campaign.

341
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,960
Earl drags Carl back into another mayoral election, and while it looks like Carl might

342
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:40,040
win this one, Earl accidentally screws it up again when he gets arrested for falling

343
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,040
on a cop.

344
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:52,220
But the real tragedy is that, Carl just can't believe Earl is trying to do better.

345
00:20:52,220 --> 00:21:10,160
But that's not the whole story.

346
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:14,840
A few episodes later, in Dad's Car, we see Earl's efforts start to pay off when his

347
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,220
attempt to return Carl's lost Mustang reveals that the car was meant for Earl, which has

348
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,640
Earl putting himself on his own list.

349
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:40,240
Earl doesn't just get the car, but the project of he and his dad putting it back together.

350
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,280
Perhaps the sweetest part of the relationship is in the season 4 episode, Monkeys Take a

351
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:50,160
Bath, where Carl finds out that his wife, Kay, played by Nancy Lenahan, cheated on him.

352
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:54,680
After learning that payback isn't going to take the pain away, Carl and Earl bond

353
00:21:54,680 --> 00:22:16,800
over having been married to women who were unfaithful.

354
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,820
Admittedly, this is pretty funny, it's also really beautiful.

355
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,920
What Earl and Carl give each other in this exchange is freedom from the chains of a masculine

356
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:29,220
repression of emotions, and they both learn the power of forgiveness.

357
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,660
If this series is about Earl seeking forgiveness from others, this episode, and this final

358
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,340
part of his journey with his father, reveal that he also needed to find a way to forgive

359
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,500
others himself, because sometimes, even Earl is the victim.

360
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:46,280
In this case, the victim of a society that told him he wasn't allowed to cry.

361
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:56,640
And anyone raised as a boy can certainly relate to that.

362
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:06,040
Kay Hickey describes her sons like this.

363
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,080
I would rather say that Randy is… not complex.

364
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:14,640
But that doesn't make him any less worthy of the respect and admiration one has for

365
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,640
Earl.

366
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:19,240
One of the first things we learn about Randy is how much he cares about his brother.

367
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:22,680
And it's not so much that he needs Earl to babysit him all the time, but that Randy

368
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,400
chooses to be with his brother.

369
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,440
This makes Randy the perfect karma partner for Earl.

370
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:44,640
Earl sums it up well in the season 1 episode, Monkeys in Space, when he says…

371
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,680
Earl's appreciation of Randy, not just as a helper, but as a brother, is evident

372
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
throughout the series.

373
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:53,680
You get a real sense that they were always close, but if anything, working on the list

374
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,920
has brought them even closer together, particularly when Randy goes the extra mile to help Earl

375
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:01,560
with his list, even if it means putting his own wants on hold.

376
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:16,160
This is from the season 1 episode, Still Beer from a Golfer.

377
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,960
Earl and Randy have a very sweet relationship.

378
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:22,120
They're perhaps not typical brothers in that they sleep in the same bed and spend

379
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,640
every day together, but they support each other in everything they do.

380
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,120
Randy's ability to do good reinforces the point made about doing good being a relatively

381
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,760
simple proposition.

382
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,840
If Earl can do it, why not Randy?

383
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:38,100
His whole character serves as an extreme example of one of the points I mentioned about Earl,

384
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:42,040
that doing good does not require some sophisticated set of ethics.

385
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:46,320
In season 4's Got the Babysitter Pregnant, we get a sense of how far Randy has come when

386
00:24:46,320 --> 00:25:03,040
he fends for himself while helping someone on Earl's list.

387
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:06,680
With Randy having someone to look up to him the way he looked up to Earl, Randy starts

388
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,780
living by Earl's positive example, taking care of the guy and trying to get his life

389
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,780
in order.

390
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,400
And Randy reveals just how much his adventures with Earl have changed him for the better.

391
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:30,280
Although Earl does take care of Randy to a degree, it's important that this is a

392
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:40,240
voluntary relationship and Randy does his job as well, taking care of Earl.

393
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,240
Going back to the label of slow, we do need to address how Randy is often depicted on

394
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,700
the show as being less bright than most of the people around him.

395
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:53,260
In the season 2 episode, Harassed a Reporter, we see how some people view Randy when a news

396
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,860
story covering Earl's list tries to tug on the heartstrings of the audience by putting

397
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:10,220
Randy in a certain light.

398
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:14,300
When Randy confronts the reporter about how she deceptively edited the footage, she says

399
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:20,080
it was revenge for all the times he ruined her live broadcasts in the past.

400
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:33,480
Randy, who had been feeling overlooked compared to his do-gooder brother, takes the reporter's

401
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:47,460
words rather well.

402
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:51,060
Randy may not be a genius, but his ability to look on the bright side here reveals a

403
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:55,100
good heart and a mindset that doesn't let him get too trapped in self-pity.

404
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,340
But more important is that his fear of being labeled special reveals how labels like that

405
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,600
trap people.

406
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:04,820
It would turn Randy into an object of pity and mockery, and he's so much more than

407
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,000
what his grades and score are like.

408
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,980
In other shows, characters like Randy don't get nearly as much screen time unless they're

409
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,480
there to be mocked with brief one-liners.

410
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,480
And more than being a big part of the show, Randy has a really fulfilling life.

411
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:22,520
He falls in love multiple times, he goes on adventures, and when Earl is incapacitated,

412
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,000
he steps up for his brother and takes the list on himself.

413
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,040
Randy gets to be a part of the show just the way everyone else is, and more so than just

414
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:33,080
about every other character aside from Earl.

415
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,520
Randy is definitely not common, but we don't need to label him with a condition in need

416
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,720
of treatment.

417
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,920
Being different is not always a medical condition, and Randy is still a valuable and important

418
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:46,480
part of Camden County.

419
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,920
Another big part of Randy's story, at least in the first two seasons, is his crush on

420
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,920
Catalina.

421
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:57,380
Randy's fixation here is a bit creepy at times, and a bit strange considering we see

422
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,340
him date another woman within the time period he has a crush on Catalina.

423
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,780
Even after Randy marries Catalina to deal with her citizenship issues, he still can't

424
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,500
bring himself to be honest with her, and when he does, she only pretends to return his feelings.

425
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:14,820
Catalina then takes Joy's advice to make herself as gross as possible so they can ask

426
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:17,340
Saks and she can turn Randy off forever.

427
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,860
And it works, Randy is grossed out, but Catalina suddenly regrets it because Randy is apparently

428
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:26,940
great at Saks and their roles are reversed, with Catalina longing for Randy and him being

429
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,120
oblivious and uninterested.

430
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,700
And then the show just kinda drops that whole story and never really brings it up again.

431
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,600
The whole misadventure would feel strange not to mention, but perhaps it serves as an example

432
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:40,580
of why certain plotlines are introduced and then dropped in the series.

433
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Personally, I suspect Randy's strength as a character is part of the reason this plotline

434
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,580
got scrapped.

435
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:49,580
He was so versatile and capable of so much that he didn't need a running premise to

436
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:54,260
fuel story ideas, he got to generate them all on his own by being himself.

437
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:59,300
He never really needed the crush on Catalina to make him interesting, he was always interesting.

438
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:08,220
Ethan Subley touched on this briefly in a panel discussion.

439
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:12,740
Randy is always the same because the best parts of him don't really need to change.

440
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:17,140
Sure he grows and changes because of Earl's positive influence, but deep down he was always

441
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,540
a sweet guy with a good heart and his unique perspective of the world let him see things

442
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:26,100
that other people didn't, and sometimes that's all you need to tell good stories.

443
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,780
As one example of a fun Randy-centered story, in season 4's We've Got Spirit, we find

444
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:39,440
out that Randy has always dreamed of being a cheerleader.

445
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,260
We see Randy take the lead, inspiring the other cheerleaders at the camp, and when it's

446
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,140
finally time to perform, he goes out there and shows everyone what he's got, even if

447
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:55,940
everyone in Camden only showed up to have a laugh.

448
00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:02,460
And this time, it's Earl who steps up to support Randy.

449
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,860
The Camden Squad wins everyone over.

450
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:09,380
A nice touch in this episode is that, even though Randy is doing his own thing, it doesn't

451
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,740
mean he doesn't need Earl to support him.

452
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,380
If Randy is always backing up Earl, Earl can also do the same for Randy.

453
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,580
I personally don't have a brother, but I know if I did, I'd want a relationship

454
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:29,700
to be like Randy's and Earl's.

455
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,860
Joy Turner is not an easy woman to love.

456
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:36,300
She's rude, mean, and self-absorbed.

457
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,340
In the early episodes of the series, it's almost as though she's being set up to be

458
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:43,940
the villain, trying to kill Earl so she can get his lottery winnings, but the series quickly

459
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,820
readjusted and took some time to portray Joy in a more sympathetic light, at least

460
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,820
a little bit.

461
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,940
Jamie Pressley's portrayal of Joy was a major standout early in the show's run.

462
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,740
Pressley was the only member of the principal cast nominated for an Emmy for her performance

463
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:08,940
on the series, and she won Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series in 2007.

464
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:12,740
It was well-earned, and you can see Joy's role in the series expanding as they realized

465
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,740
how good Pressley was playing her.

466
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:50,340
In an interview, Pressley described the appeal of Joy as being an inner voice women wished

467
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,340
they could channel.

468
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:56,340
Believe it or not, I have women come up to me all the time saying, repeating all the

469
00:31:56,340 --> 00:32:03,340
one-liners that Joy has, because there's a little bit of Joy in every woman that wants

470
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,820
to come out sometimes.

471
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:09,740
But what made the character work, and seems so particularly convincing, was her gradually

472
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,820
revealed range as a character.

473
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:16,220
When Joy and Darnell get married in Season 1's Joy's Wedding, it becomes a list item

474
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:24,180
for Earl when he drunkenly ruins it.

475
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:28,300
Things don't get too much better when, while planning Joy's dream wedding, Earl sleeps

476
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
with Joy.

477
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,020
Darnell is crushed when he finds out, and the wedding only goes forward when he realizes

478
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:49,500
the full depth of Joy's feelings.

479
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:54,140
Earl is very much an early work in progress, particularly in these early episodes, and

480
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,660
Joy represents something similar throughout the run of the series.

481
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:02,980
Although Earl is an imperfect convert to Karma, Joy is less impressed with the idea of Karma.

482
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:08,500
But as the series progresses, we, very slowly, see Joy begin to change.

483
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,380
It starts with her and Earl developing a real friendship.

484
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:15,620
In Season 1's The Bounty Hunter, we see Joy realizing just how far Earl is willing

485
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,760
to go to help her, keeping Joy safe from a bounty hunter, and the two put their marriage

486
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:28,840
in perspective.

487
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,960
In Season 2's Blow, Joy, finding out she has a half-sister, Liberty Washington, played

488
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:48,720
by Tamala Jones, ends up with Joy becoming a surrogate for her.

489
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,260
And by Season 4, Joy begins to check her own harsh behavior when she sees how it impacts

490
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,780
her kids in the episode, Joy and a Bubble.

491
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:27,840
What makes for a compelling character is someone who changes throughout the story, whether

492
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:32,680
they reveal parts of themselves not immediately evident, such as Joy's less abrasive side

493
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,200
coming out, or if a character grows, such as Joy becoming more empathetic to the people

494
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,280
around her.

495
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,440
In the context of My Name is Earl, it speaks to the transformative power of doing good

496
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:47,140
deeds that both of these things become more apparent as Joy is impacted by the good works

497
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,400
of Earl, and even does a couple herself.

498
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:53,120
Joy's life goes through some turbulent changes throughout the series.

499
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,560
She nearly goes to prison in one season and ends up in the Witness Protection Program

500
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:01,460
in another, but the real changes we care about are the ones inside her, the slow glacial

501
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:06,860
changes that reveal that even this incredibly unlikable woman has the capacity to be better.

502
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:12,020
Late in Season 4, Earl works to get Joy a spot on the TV game show Estrada or Nada,

503
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,460
in the two-parter Darnell outed.

504
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,980
Throughout the episode, we learn about how Joy dreams of being a celebrity, and she thinks

505
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:21,220
appearing on this game show is her last chance at that dream.

506
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:34,600
Her talents, though, are limited.

507
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:39,840
When appearing on TV leads Darnell's assumed identity to be compromised, more on that later,

508
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,560
they have to go into hiding.

509
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:52,580
But Crabman risks it all to let Joy live her dream.

510
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:58,460
And we see Joy show up that smug Eric Estrada.

511
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:06,920
Of course, none of that would have been possible without a few key assists from Earl, and we

512
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:23,160
get an idea of how far the relationship has come.

513
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,680
Joy and Darnell go into hiding for a few episodes, but when Joy is living the rich lifestyle

514
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,480
she thought she wanted, it reinforces that she was already happy with what she had.

515
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,680
They do return to their status quo of living in the trailer park in Camden, but even before

516
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,960
all that silliness, we see in this two-parter just how much Joy has in her life.

517
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:43,920
She has a husband who loves her, two kids who depend on her, and great friends like

518
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,580
Randy and Earl, and her harsh exterior is made less bitter with that knowledge.

519
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:52,040
And while she's still hard as nails, she can find the space to be happy and appreciate

520
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,240
the life she has.

521
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,680
Life doesn't need to dramatically change for her.

522
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,680
All she needs is a willingness to see what she already has around her.

523
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:02,360
That's part of the lesson Joy learns, and it's made possible because the people around

524
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,920
her stopped doing bad things and started doing good things.

525
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,440
Good works don't need to give someone a mansion, it just needs to give them a new

526
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:16,880
way of looking at their life.

527
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,400
My Name is Earl had a number of really strange episodes.

528
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,520
There are brief scenes with live-action puppets of the cast, there are multiple episodes where

529
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,440
the people of Camden are in an episode of Cops, and there's one fun episode where

530
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,600
the opening credits get recut to feature different characters, but these are relatively

531
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,400
short and self-contained.

532
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,880
The most ambitious project of the show is undoubtedly its entire third season.

533
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:44,240
Set up in the Season 2 finale, The Trial, we see Joy, who had spent much of Season 2 worried

534
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,960
about going to prison after stealing a truck, finally go to trial.

535
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:52,040
The evidence is tipping against Joy, namely recordings of a terrified Earl calling the

536
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:57,280
cops on her from the time they were married, so Earl feeling responsible does something

537
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
drastic.

538
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:15,280
Earl sees this as a form of karma, a punishment for all the crimes he's committed, and he

539
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,600
sentenced to two years in prison.

540
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:23,880
He even asked to give up his list.

541
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,160
On most other shows, this finale is a corner the show would have to write itself out of

542
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:32,360
in the Season 3 premiere, and we would see Earl leave prison at the end of the episode

543
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,800
to get back to the usual status quo.

544
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,000
Instead, My Name is Earl leaned into this idea of Earl in prison and reinvented itself

545
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
for its entire third season.

546
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,060
The third season can effectively be split into three acts.

547
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,640
The first has Earl in prison, the second has Earl in a coma, and the last has Earl as a

548
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
married man.

549
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,240
That's obviously a lot to happen, so let's go through this season in more detail.

550
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:59,720
Earl's life has been improving by working on his list, and as he's done good things,

551
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,240
good things have come to him.

552
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:05,400
There were always exceptions when times would get tough, and his faith in karma and the

553
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,600
list was tested, but by the end of each episode, he was more or less through the worst of it.

554
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,320
It wasn't until the beginning of Season 3 that we see Earl face his most challenging

555
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,440
test, going to prison.

556
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,960
One of his first real challenges is finding a gang for protection.

557
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,440
I'm just saying, I don't see why I have to shave my head.

558
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,440
It hates in your heart, not in your hair.

559
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,200
Forget it, I'm out.

560
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,000
Earl finds a better way of surviving in prison by deciding to stay himself and keep doing

561
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,400
good things for others.

562
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,880
I realize that no matter how scared I get, I'm going to survive in prison and I have

563
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,880
to do it as myself.

564
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:49,800
Because my name isn't inmate number 28301-016, my name is Earl.

565
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,480
And while it makes his life in prison better, Earl is still left with the difficult question

566
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,520
of how, even though he's doing good things, he's still trapped in prison.

567
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,440
At first, it seems as though karma will reward him as his good deeds start leading him toward

568
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:07,200
an early release, with the warden, played by Craig T. Nelson, shaving time off Earl's

569
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,560
sentence for each time he assists the warden in some kind of project.

570
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,840
Earl, you've got six months and ten days left in here.

571
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,720
Now you make this program work and I will give you a certificate for six months off

572
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:19,720
your sentence.

573
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:24,360
But when Earl is getting close to his release, the warden screws him over.

574
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,480
I don't know what I would do here without you to cover my ass.

575
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:30,960
Well, I guess you're going to find out tomorrow.

576
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,560
Thanks again, sir.

577
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:42,320
A frustrated Earl resorts to making a prison escape.

578
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:46,480
Unfortunately, the escape attempt is foiled, but when Earl finds out the warden formerly

579
00:40:46,480 --> 00:41:01,760
had a career in porn, in the episode titled, Early Release.

580
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:04,760
The resolution here doesn't quite work in Earl's mind.

581
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,640
He responded to being screwed over by doing something bad using blackmail and now he was

582
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:18,120
being rewarded for it.

583
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,640
First Earl is punished for doing something good and then rewarded for doing something

584
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
bad.

585
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,400
So what does that say about karma?

586
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,200
In the next episode, Bad Earl, we see Earl revert to his bad ways and he turns his back

587
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,320
on the list.

588
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:48,680
In this clip, Earl was filling in for a stripper, hence, the outfit.

589
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:52,560
The episode raises an interesting question of how doing good things can have a selfish

590
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,560
motive.

591
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,760
Earl wants a reward for his good deeds.

592
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,900
As Earl behaves badly, he drifts further from his loved ones and Randy tries to convince

593
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:15,660
him to change back to good Earl with an earnest speech.

594
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:25,260
But it doesn't work.

595
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:29,380
Good things are happening for other people, but for Earl, that isn't enough anymore and

596
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:55,340
he ends up right where he started in the first episode.

597
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,180
When Earl finds out the person who hit him is Billy, played by Alyssa Milano, he finally

598
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:01,300
believes he's found his reward.

599
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:04,980
As a quick rewind, Billy is the ex-girlfriend of Frank, a buddy of Earl's who is locked

600
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,980
up with him.

601
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,900
Part of Earl helping Frank in prison was convincing him to let Billy find a better life without

602
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:14,800
Frank's bad influence and Earl developed a small crush on Billy only to now be reunited

603
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,300
when her car hits him.

604
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,260
And then karma comes for Billy too.

605
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:24,580
While in a coma, Earl enters a sitcom fantasy land.

606
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:29,140
While trapped there, Randy figures that working on list items will save Earl and so Randy

607
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,780
does them in Earl's place.

608
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:45,220
And eventually, Earl is rescued from his coma in the episode, Killer Ball.

609
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:49,020
Earl finds Billy and the two get married and even though Earl used the last of his lottery

610
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:53,980
winnings putting on a prison prom, Billy has come into some insurance money of her own.

611
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:58,500
So the moral of the story, at least at this point, seems to be that if you persevere with

612
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:03,700
karma eventually, through the people you helped, you will receive the reward of being married

613
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,700
to Alyssa Milano.

614
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,120
Except the season isn't over yet.

615
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:12,540
Over the next few episodes, we find out that marrying a woman because she was your coma

616
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:18,200
fantasy doesn't quite work and Earl realizes that he and Billy are a bad fit.

617
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:32,680
She suggests the worst in the episode, Girl Earl.

618
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:37,360
In the episode, Camdenites, while struggling with Billy, Earl works on his list crossing

619
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,840
off Dee Dee, played by Tracy Ashton.

620
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:43,880
The one-legged woman he ran out on was something of a running joke throughout the series so

621
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,220
seemed like a big deal for him to finally be tackling this list item.

622
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,080
He thought by helping her it would improve his relationship with Billy since this was

623
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:55,340
a woman he'd rung and maybe that's the reason he was having bad luck with women in general.

624
00:44:55,340 --> 00:45:08,100
All Dee Dee wants is for Earl to understand her by walking a mile in her shoe.

625
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:12,300
Although Earl thought he would be helping his relationship with Billy by crossing Dee Dee

626
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,020
off his list, it doesn't really help.

627
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:20,300
In fact, the only thing that really helps here is that Billy and Earl eventually separate,

628
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:24,860
with Billy adopting a more rustic lifestyle leaving her insurance money with Earl.

629
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:29,500
So at the end of all this hardship, the only thing even resembling a reward for Earl is

630
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:32,940
that he's giving the remnants of Billy's insurance money.

631
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:49,580
And Earl is going to do what he was doing with his lottery winnings and that's help other people.

632
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,980
In addition to the fact that Billy being a reward is pretty creepy, as a person shouldn't

633
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,740
be a prize to be won.

634
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:19,900
The overarching message of this season is that Earl should not be doing good for any

635
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:22,060
sort of external reward.

636
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:25,940
He should be doing it because he's internally motivated to do good for others.

637
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,420
In the first two seasons, you might argue that Earl still imagined he'd get some magical

638
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:34,200
reward at the end of his list, but the third season establishes that this journey may not

639
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,580
end with some sort of grand reward.

640
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:41,580
Rather, the reason to do this is not some fabulous cash prize like an even bigger lottery

641
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:46,460
winnings, but instead feel that personal satisfaction with his life, the joy that comes

642
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:47,860
from helping others.

643
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:52,420
At the end of season 3, Earl's life appears the same on the outside, but on the inside

644
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:54,380
he's grown into a better version of himself.

645
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,220
He's now doing good deeds for a better reason.

646
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:00,500
You might say that's still kind of selfish because he's getting a good feeling from

647
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,580
helping others, but going from an external reward to an internal one, skipping the need

648
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:08,600
for material comforts to get that good feeling, has shown Earl a simpler and more effective

649
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:13,320
way of enjoying his life, and had the series run longer, maybe his drive to do good things

650
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,760
could have been explored on an even deeper level.

651
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:20,920
But sadly, this giant step in season 3 is the only one we get in the series.

652
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:26,280
Structurally, the third season was also very different when compared to how other sitcoms

653
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,680
tend to tell long-form stories.

654
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:32,760
In most of the shows that have done similar things with season-long arcs, they're not

655
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:35,320
quite as comprehensive as My Name is Earl's.

656
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:39,120
Some examples would include the second season of Cheers, where we saw Sam and Diane trying

657
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:43,680
to be a couple, the fourth season of Parks and Rec with Leslie Knope running for office,

658
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:47,780
and the fifth season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air with Will and Lisa falling in love.

659
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:52,160
But the difference between My Name is Earl's season-long arc and these other shows is that,

660
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,500
while most other arcs featured change to a show's premise to create different dynamics

661
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:01,520
in each episode, telling standalone episodes that simply reflect that new premise, My Name

662
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:06,560
is Earl used a season-long arc to tell a much bigger, more complicated story.

663
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,760
It tested Earl's commitment to karma and examined what really motivated him.

664
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:15,680
It helped him realize the difference between a desire to do good and a desire for a reward.

665
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,080
And Earl's understanding of that dynamic changes throughout the season as we see him

666
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,680
in many different circumstances.

667
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,320
And at the end of it all, he grows and evolves as a character in a way that you don't typically

668
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,360
see in other shows.

669
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:32,440
Season 3 did draw some criticisms from the audience though, particularly the part where

670
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,400
Earl was trapped in a coma.

671
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,720
While referencing classic sitcoms within new ones is a cute idea, later on the show seemed

672
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:43,780
to acknowledge that certain members of the audience weren't too keen on this meta-joke.

673
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:56,680
This is a clip referencing that in the fourth season episode, Inside Probe Part 1.

674
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:00,140
And one interesting artifact of this season is that, when the show had a lengthy break

675
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:04,960
because of the writers' strike from 2007 to 2008, it came back with a recap ahead of

676
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:15,760
its return episode delivered by NBC Universal CEO and President Jeff Zucker.

677
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:20,520
This weird intro was not well-received and even led to a short article on Deadline, an

678
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:24,760
entertainment industry outlet, asking if Zucker had lost his mind.

679
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:29,040
It was actually Greg Garcia's idea to have Zucker do this intro, but even so, the intro

680
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,120
would be scrubbed from the DVD release.

681
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,400
And before leaving Season 3 entirely, I do want to highlight a surprisingly good trans

682
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:49,520
joke.

683
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,600
I think it's important to highlight that joke because, while there are other jokes

684
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:57,360
in the series that are less kind, including the use of a transphobic slur, this good joke

685
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:01,400
reveals the capacity to learn and improve from that previous bad behavior, just like

686
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,400
Earl.

687
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,400
Although it should be mentioned that a cis man in a dress is not good casting for a trans

688
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:10,160
woman, so it's still very much a work in progress.

689
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,160
Just like Earl.

690
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:17,920
And I have to acknowledge another moment in Season 3 where Randy is encouraging some anti-jose

691
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:31,040
violence.

692
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:35,720
As a Jose, this anti-jose nonsense is deeply disappointing and I hope the show will do

693
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,720
better.

694
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,920
Just do better.

695
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,960
There are a lot of flashbacks in the series.

696
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,600
Some of them go on for nearly a whole episode.

697
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,320
An early example being Season 1's Y2K episode where we see how Earl, Joy, Randy, Darnell,

698
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:57,760
and Donny, played by Silas Weir Mitchell, handle the impending technological apocalypse

699
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:06,280
that never was.

700
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,680
My Name is Earl is a show defined by the past of its characters.

701
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:13,240
Earl's past of wrongdoings is an obvious one, but in the case of other members of the

702
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:16,720
cast, their pasts are also a big part of their characters.

703
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:20,960
Catalina is a character whose past gradually gets revealed in the first half of this series.

704
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:25,120
Not just that she entered the US illegally, but also that, before she became a hotel maid,

705
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:29,760
she worked as a stripper at Club Chubby, a job she goes back to in the Season 2 episode

706
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:30,760
Jump for Joy.

707
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:35,520
And in Season 2's mailbox, we get a slow burn reveal where we find out Catalina has

708
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:42,220
killed someone.

709
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:52,700
This is followed up in Season 3's The Frank Factor.

710
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:55,160
This is a nice example of continuity on the show.

711
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:59,340
If Earl's story is about him realizing the impact of his past on his present, the same

712
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:01,380
is true for other characters too.

713
00:52:01,380 --> 00:52:05,540
We learn more about Catalina's past when she is deported, and Earl and Randy have to

714
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:09,100
rescue her in the Season 2 two-parter south of the border.

715
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:13,860
Although she's sent to what we're told is her hometown in Mexico, later on in the

716
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:18,780
series it's revealed that Catalina is from La Paz, which is the capital of Bolivia.

717
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:22,540
This is an example of the show playing fast and loose with its continuity.

718
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:27,160
It's pretty common for sitcoms to place comedy over continuity, but it's a bit more noticeable

719
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:31,500
in My Name is Earl, where a character's history is the basis of so much of what they

720
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:36,860
do in the series, and the show certainly doesn't help itself with the many flashbacks it includes.

721
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:40,740
That all said, there are enough consistent facts to make sense of these characters'

722
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,740
history.

723
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:47,180
Regardless of whether it's her home country or not, Mexico is where Catalina is deported

724
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,180
to.

725
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:51,660
And Randy marries Catalina so she can come back to America.

726
00:52:51,660 --> 00:52:54,980
Of course, as we already talked about, it doesn't work out for them.

727
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:58,700
And it's around here that Catalina's character seems to drift around a bit, as if there was

728
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,740
no definite plans for her.

729
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:04,460
While she's a fun addition to the cast and an interesting character, the key to making

730
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:07,180
her interesting is often done by explaining her history.

731
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:11,200
We see this whole truth for Darnell as well, a character who is very mysterious in the

732
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,180
early seasons, as the only clue we get to his history is that he's in the witness

733
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:19,020
relocation program and his name used to be Harry Monroe.

734
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:22,760
It isn't until the show's fourth season we finally get some answers as to who Harry

735
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,100
Monroe is in the two-parter Darnell outed.

736
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:30,780
While, as mentioned earlier, a lot of this two-parter is dedicated to Joy trying to show

737
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:35,620
up Erika Strada and prove she can be a celebrity, what complicates the plan is Darnell appearing

738
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:53,540
on national television and having his cover identity blown.

739
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:58,420
In My Name is Alias, a few episodes later, we get a more complete answer as to who Darnell

740
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:15,500
is when his secret agent father, played by Danny Glover, comes to make amends with him.

741
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,500
Darnell left his life as a government assassin when he was asked to kill a child.

742
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,780
When he testified against the agency in front of a subcommittee, the agency wanted revenge

743
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,740
and Darnell had to go into witness protection.

744
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:30,340
While this history for Darnell wasn't planned from the beginning, the show's creators

745
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:44,540
always knew he'd have a wild backstory.

746
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:47,900
These revelations do contradict the fact that we saw Darnell's family in the season one

747
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:51,900
episode Joy's Wedding, though that's explained away as them being other people in the witness

748
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,300
protection program.

749
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:56,620
Both Darnell and Catalina are their most interesting when their pasts confront them

750
00:54:56,620 --> 00:55:00,220
in the present, along with the show's many flashbacks and Earl's quests.

751
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:04,180
This is how change over time is represented in the series, and it gives the impression

752
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:08,580
that these characters are more rich and detailed than what little we may see them do within

753
00:55:08,580 --> 00:55:10,580
the context of an episode.

754
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,420
There's always the subtle suggestion that there's more to these characters than meets

755
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,620
the eye, and some part of their past is just waiting to leap out from the shadows.

756
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,660
Catalina and Darnell are both similar to Earl in that they're happier in the present because

757
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,140
of the choices they've made to live happier lives.

758
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,900
They certainly aren't perfect, but the worst conditions of their past are a reminder of

759
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:32,460
why they chose to leave their old lives in Bolivia and as a secret agent, respectively.

760
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,640
They were miserable in both places.

761
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,300
Much like Earl making a list of wrongdoings and making up for them, the changes Catalina

762
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:39,980
and Darnell make were a challenge.

763
00:55:39,980 --> 00:55:44,420
Leaving a life behind, no matter how you do it, is always difficult, but part of the show's

764
00:55:44,420 --> 00:55:48,660
optimism comes from that willingness to make a try against difficult odds, and the courage

765
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:58,540
it takes to remake your own life.

766
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:03,020
Camden County is one of those fictional places in a TV show that never gets a precise location

767
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,420
in the real world.

768
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:08,620
The closest we get to any confirmation is that it definitely is not the same Camden

769
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,220
County in New Jersey.

770
00:56:10,220 --> 00:56:14,220
Its local accent and complete lack of snow at Christmas time suggest it's somewhere

771
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,460
in the southern US, but it's hard to be more precise than that.

772
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:22,580
We can contrast this to the vaguely named Big City in the season 1 episode, Stole P's

773
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:27,140
HD Cart, where we see Earl struggle to get any justice from a big corporation trying

774
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:41,980
to muscle a local hot dog cart out of Camden.

775
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:57,020
That Earl learns an important truth.

776
00:56:57,020 --> 00:57:01,660
This episode has a fun message about how corporations exploit labor and that real restorative justice

777
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:06,180
involves going Robin Hood on a big corporation, but there's another larger message here

778
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,720
about how the people of Camden, especially Earl and his friends, exist outside the world

779
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,680
of white shirts and ties.

780
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:17,000
This needs to be understood as not a complete rejection of living in a society, as we see

781
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:21,160
Earl learn the value of having a functioning government in the season 1 episode didn't

782
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,160
pay taxes.

783
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:32,880
Earl's vision of a more just world is one where people help other people, and the world

784
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:37,120
of big business, represented by the big city, is a rejection of that ethos.

785
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,320
It embraces selfishness and the exploitation of others.

786
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:43,920
Camden doesn't feel like a real place because it operates on such a heightened sense

787
00:57:43,920 --> 00:57:48,120
of reality, which is probably why it doesn't feel unrealistic for Earl's change of heart

788
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,000
to have such a wide ripple effect.

789
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,520
But it cuts in other ways too, such as in the season 2 episode, Van Hickey, where Earl's

790
00:57:54,520 --> 00:58:14,320
longtime friend, Ralph, played by Giovanni Rubisi, threatens to kill him.

791
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:18,600
The impact of this dynamic is explained well in the DVD audio commentary for that episode.

792
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:28,960
Camden is a place where some scary stuff goes down, and you can believe characters

793
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,880
when they say they're going to try to kill someone.

794
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,920
But in that heightened sense of reality, there's also the possibility to do some good.

795
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:39,440
As we go through the series, Earl's good deeds create new friends wherever he goes,

796
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:43,200
helping shape the community into one where everybody helps each other rather than compete

797
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,520
against each other.

798
00:58:44,520 --> 00:58:47,920
But this isn't just a rejection of the capitalist mindset.

799
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:52,340
It goes a step further by presenting Camden, and Earl's social circle, as a meeting place

800
00:58:52,340 --> 00:59:03,920
for all types of people.

801
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,360
In season 2, with the episode Sticks and Stones, we get a great example when Earl tries to

802
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:12,280
make up for teasing a girl who had facial hair in school and then finds himself in a

803
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:33,880
small community of circus performers.

804
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,080
As Earl learns more about the performers as people, he also learns to identify with them

805
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,920
when he's reminded he was teased for having Harry Nipples as a kid.

806
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,400
The episode ends with Earl facing his fear and going off the high dive with his shirt

807
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:49,560
off, and he's joined by the performers who refuse to hide away in their private community.

808
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:53,520
It's about learning to have some pride, even if you're a little different, and that

809
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:55,680
we're all a little different in our own ways.

810
00:59:55,680 --> 01:00:00,320
It's a pretty basic message, but the series is more than just bringing in people for an

811
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:03,280
episode to say, hey, they're decent people too.

812
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:07,280
A lot of these characters appear again throughout the series, much in the way Kenny became a

813
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,480
series regular after the premiere.

814
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:13,120
These characters don't just show up to teach Earl a lesson, they become active members

815
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,360
of his community.

816
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:19,000
We see another example in season 1's Teacher Earl, where Earl teaches English as a second

817
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:37,840
language to make up for all the times he's made fun of people with accents.

818
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,600
Actually something ironic here about the actor who plays Neskabar a lob-lop, Abdul-e-Ngom,

819
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:47,400
he actually speaks at least five languages, or six depending on who you believe in the

820
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:51,760
DVD commentaries, or maybe seven if you believe everything you read on the internet.

821
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:55,520
Although the depiction has some of these people borders on the offensive, the series seems

822
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:59,520
to develop in its depictions of these characters the same way Earl learns to be more sensitive

823
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,040
to people who are different.

824
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:04,840
Much like the circus performers, Neskabar becomes a regular in the series in a lot of

825
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:24,880
fun and creative ways.

826
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:30,880
When the series begins, Earl's concept of us is just him and Randy, but as it progresses,

827
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:35,960
that us grows to include so many more people, not just the obvious editions of Joy, Darnell,

828
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:41,920
and Catalina, but also the people he would place in the very undesirable bucket of them.

829
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:46,960
And importantly, not just to Earl, a lot of these people who become part of the us label

830
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:51,760
are often marginalized by society with little access to power, keeping them perpetually

831
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:54,440
trapped under the label of them.

832
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:59,000
Immigrants and people born a little different have every right to be a part of our communities.

833
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:02,560
Any us worth making is one that includes these people too.

834
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:07,260
In the season two episode, our cops is on, we get a sense of how big the us is getting

835
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:10,160
with numerous cameos from the people of Camden.

836
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,000
A nice bit of subtext in this episode is that even though their lives and relationships

837
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:18,360
weren't being improved by Earl in his list since the episode predates it, it does show

838
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,440
us that they were all in community with one another already.

839
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:25,000
They were just either strangers or hostile to one another.

840
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,960
The fact that they're all sitting here laughing, drinking, and watching this episode together

841
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:34,160
reinforces the transformative nature of doing good deeds and the impact it has on the community.

842
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:38,840
In the season three episode, Camdenites, when Earl has to untip Joy's trailer, which he

843
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,880
drugingly tipped over a few episodes earlier, he's assisted by all the people of Camden

844
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:44,680
he's helped out over the years.

845
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:48,080
When I was doing bad things, no one would help me with anything, but now that I was

846
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:51,640
doing good things, I had lots of friends willing to pitch in.

847
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:55,680
And they prove that by working together, they can make their whole community a better place.

848
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:58,000
And that doing good is infectious.

849
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:02,560
Now, everybody just calm down.

850
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:08,220
On May 14th, 2009, the final episode of My Name Is Earl aired, although it wasn't meant

851
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,720
to be the finale.

852
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:14,040
Titled Dodge's Dad, the episode centers around Joy finding out that Dodge, her eldest

853
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:18,400
son, isn't actually the son of Little Chubby, played by Norm Macdonald.

854
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,840
It turns out that Earl, who raised Dodge thinking he was another man's son, is actually Dodge's

855
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:24,840
biological father.

856
01:03:24,840 --> 01:03:25,840
No.

857
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,840
Yep.

858
01:03:26,840 --> 01:03:27,840
No.

859
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,400
If anything, you did me, I was drunk.

860
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:34,020
This is one of the dangers of hooking up at a costume party.

861
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:38,800
But even more shocking than the Dodge revelation is that Earl Jr. isn't actually Darnell's

862
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:39,800
son.

863
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:44,000
These three DNAs match, that means it's you and the boys, which makes this one mine

864
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:47,040
and it doesn't match any of those.

865
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,040
What does that mean?

866
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:50,240
It means I'm not Earl Jr.'s father.

867
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:53,680
And the last line we ever hear from the series is Joy saying,

868
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:57,240
Now, everybody just calm down.

869
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:00,360
And we got a giant message saying, to be continued.

870
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,000
Only it wasn't.

871
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:05,720
Although My Name is Earl premiered to very strong ratings, it gradually slipped as the

872
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:07,160
seasons rolled on.

873
01:04:07,160 --> 01:04:11,400
For its fourth season, it had fallen to 60 second place in the ratings, Far Cry from

874
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,160
its debut at 22nd.

875
01:04:13,160 --> 01:04:18,040
But it is strange that it was cancelled while other NBC shows such as Chuck and Parks and

876
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,880
Recreation, both with lower ratings, were both renewed.

877
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:25,960
Whatever the reason, going into that episode, creator Greg Garcia was under the impression

878
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:28,440
that this would not be the final season.

879
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:32,400
Codd completely flat-footed, the only sign that this might be the final episode is the

880
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:36,760
production company tag at the end where we see a partially shaved Jason Lee.

881
01:04:36,760 --> 01:04:40,280
Even that suggests that maybe they're not entirely done yet.

882
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:44,220
After being cancelled by NBC, there were talks with several networks to pick up the series,

883
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:46,400
with TBS being a strong contender.

884
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,340
But ultimately, the cost of the series to fulfill its creative vision was just too much

885
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,460
for any other network to sign on.

886
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:57,740
And so Earl's ending would remain, at least for now, untold.

887
01:04:57,740 --> 01:05:03,740
In a 2013 Reddit Ask Me Anything, Greg Garcia was asked how the series was meant to end.

888
01:05:03,740 --> 01:05:08,400
This answer remains our best look at what the future held for Earl Hickey.

889
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:11,940
We never really got the chance to fully figure it out, but the talk in the writers room was

890
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:17,540
that Earl Jr's dad was going to be someone famous, like Dave Chappelle or Lil Jon, someone

891
01:05:17,540 --> 01:05:20,760
that came to town on tour and Joy slept with.

892
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:24,160
But when we got cancelled, we never got the chance to figure it out.

893
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,960
I was worried about doing a cliffhanger, but I asked NBC if it was safe to do one at the

894
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,160
end of the season and they told me it was.

895
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,460
I guess it wasn't.

896
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:36,320
I had always had an ending to Earl, and I'm sorry I didn't get the chance to see it happen.

897
01:05:36,320 --> 01:05:40,400
You've got a show about a guy with a list, so not seeing him finish it is a bummer, but

898
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:43,380
the truth is he wasn't ever going to finish the list.

899
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:47,720
The basic idea of the ending was that, while he was stuck on a really hard list item, he

900
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,200
was going to start to get frustrated that he was never going to finish it.

901
01:05:51,200 --> 01:05:54,320
Then he runs into someone who had a list of their own and Earl was on it.

902
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:57,080
They needed to make up for something bad they had done to Earl.

903
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:00,900
He asks them where they got the idea for making a list and they tell him that someone came

904
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,200
to them with a list and that person got the idea from someone else.

905
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:09,080
Earl eventually realizes that his list started a chain reaction of people with lists and

906
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:12,200
that he's finally put more good into the world than bad.

907
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:15,400
So at that point, he was going to tear up his list and go live his life.

908
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,640
Talk into the sunset of Freeman with good karma.

909
01:06:20,640 --> 01:06:24,220
There are some interesting post scripts to My Name is Earl's cancellation, such as

910
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:27,000
the show not being the only thing that was cancelled.

911
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,400
Anyone who purchased the first DVD set of the series would have seen this fancy little

912
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:35,040
flyer advertising a My Name is Earl comic coming from Oni Press.

913
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:38,520
When asked about this, Greg Garcia explained that this project was abandoned because he

914
01:06:38,520 --> 01:06:41,600
would have lacked the creative control over it he would have liked.

915
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:45,400
One project that followed My Name is Earl that did come to fruition was Garcia's next

916
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:47,360
series, Raising Hope.

917
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:49,480
Garcia described the inspiration for the series saying,

918
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,440
The main inspiration for Raising Hope was the anger over the fact that they cancelled

919
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:54,440
My Name is Earl.

920
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:58,300
I wanted to do another single camera comedy so I could quickly hire the same crew that

921
01:06:58,300 --> 01:07:00,600
I had loved working with for four years.

922
01:07:00,600 --> 01:07:04,880
I was interested in doing a domestic comedy so I thought of the most twisted way I could

923
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:09,280
of putting a baby in a house full of people that had no idea what to do with it.

924
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,720
In addition to bringing back his crew, a number of cast members from My Name is Earl

925
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:15,080
made cameos throughout the series' run.

926
01:07:15,080 --> 01:07:18,800
There were also some cute nods to the abrupt cancellation of My Name is Earl, such as one

927
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:36,000
of the characters on Raising Hope revealing that they were a fan.

928
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:40,940
It would take a whole video to list every reference to My Name is Earl on Raising Hope,

929
01:07:40,940 --> 01:07:45,360
but I did at least want to mention the season 3 episode making the band which almost felt

930
01:07:45,360 --> 01:08:00,880
like an alternate reality episode of My Name is Earl.

931
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,720
And that's more or less that we got from the residents of Camden County following the

932
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:06,240
show's cancellation.

933
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:10,640
Jason Lee did say in a 2020 interview that he was interested in giving the show a proper

934
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:14,740
wrap-up though so far no concrete plans have emerged.

935
01:08:14,740 --> 01:08:19,000
While working on My Name is Earl, Jason Lee also starred in the first Alvin and the Chipmunks

936
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,160
live-action movie as Dave Seville, a role he'd reprise in its various squeak-walls.

937
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:27,280
He also appeared on The Memphis Beat and Up All Night.

938
01:08:27,280 --> 01:08:31,120
He's largely stepped away from acting in recent years though he's expressed interest

939
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:35,440
in reviving older projects he's worked on such as mall rats and of course My Name

940
01:08:35,440 --> 01:08:36,440
is Earl.

941
01:08:36,440 --> 01:08:39,680
Ethan Suppley has appeared in a number of roles on TV and film after the end of the

942
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:44,440
series including roles in The Wolf of Wall Street, Dog, and The Ranch.

943
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:49,280
In 2014, he reunited with former My Name is Earl co-star Jamie Pressley in the series

944
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:50,720
Jennifer Falls.

945
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,960
Jamie Pressley has worked on a number of projects following the cancellation of My Name is Earl.

946
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:59,160
In addition to the short-lived Jennifer Falls with Ethan Suppley, Pressley also appeared

947
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:04,880
on Welcome to Flash, I Hate My Teenage Daughter, and she appeared on seven seasons of the series

948
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,300
Mom.

949
01:09:06,300 --> 01:09:10,960
After My Name is Earl, Eddie Steeples appeared in the TV series The Guest Book and the movies

950
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:16,780
Hot Seat and Jujitsu, currently scheduled to appear in the upcoming movie Fallen Cards.

951
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:21,380
Since My Name is Earl, Nadine Velasquez appeared on the series The League and the movies Snitch

952
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:22,600
and Flight.

953
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:27,160
Most recently she appeared as a part of the principal cast in the ABC series Queens.

954
01:09:27,160 --> 01:09:31,200
My Name is Earl is an unfinished story of redemption and in a way, that story could

955
01:09:31,200 --> 01:09:32,640
never be finished.

956
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:36,480
Throughout the series we see Earl make right the wrong deeds of the past, but we also see

957
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,440
him make mistakes along the way, having to add new items to his list.

958
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:44,780
It's likely that the work on the list will never be completed and the desire to be an

959
01:09:44,780 --> 01:09:49,120
ideal person is not going to be completed by Earl himself but will have to be a quest

960
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,080
picked up by the people around him.

961
01:09:51,080 --> 01:09:54,680
As you can tell from that imaginative finale from Greg Garcia, that was the whole point

962
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:58,720
of the series, that doing good doesn't end with some ultimate reward waiting for

963
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:03,280
you but rather doing good makes the world a better place and that doing good inspires

964
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,920
others to do the same, with your reward being able to be part of that better world you all

965
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:08,920
share together.

966
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:13,440
It expands the idea of doing good from a solitary exercise to something more communal.

967
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:17,640
We aren't waiting for an Earl to come save us because we can all start on our own lists

968
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,840
right now and we can all make the world better together.

969
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:24,400
The cancellation of My Name is Earl will probably always sting because there's so much more

970
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:27,880
growth we could have seen in the series and ending with a cliffhanger is usually not

971
01:10:27,880 --> 01:10:29,840
a good way to leave off characters.

972
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:33,180
Even if Earl was never going to finish that list, we could have at least seen his new

973
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:37,560
struggles with fatherhood or Darnell's changing relationship with the boy he thought was his

974
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:42,440
biological son or even just Joy tracking down Earl Jr's real father.

975
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:45,760
These are the lingering questions that could use a few more episodes or a movie to wrap

976
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:46,760
up.

977
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:51,000
But Four Seasons is a lot more than most other shows get and in that four there's still

978
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:55,080
a lot of good stuff to be found about the value of trying to be a better person.

979
01:10:55,080 --> 01:10:57,280
And it's the trying that's the key.

980
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:00,760
No one will ever be perfect and Earl certainly never is.

981
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:05,280
But his example shows us that anyone, even a dirtbag with no education and a lengthy

982
01:11:05,280 --> 01:11:08,040
rap sheet, can try to make the world a better place.

983
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:14,800
All it takes is believing in karma and starting with a list.

984
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:17,940
This will probably come as a surprise to anyone who's watched these retrospectives but I

985
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:22,060
usually don't have to go out of my way to find a series.

986
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:27,140
Most shows that are classics are found streaming pretty much anywhere and special features

987
01:11:27,140 --> 01:11:31,640
and documentaries and whatnot take a bit of digging but can be found with some effort.

988
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:36,140
My Name is Earl was the first time I actually had to track down physical media in the form

989
01:11:36,140 --> 01:11:42,100
of old DVDs basically doing a lot more work just so I would have as much information as

990
01:11:42,100 --> 01:11:44,580
possible to put together this video.

991
01:11:44,580 --> 01:11:48,940
With that in mind I would like to extend an extra special thanks to my Patrons because

992
01:11:48,940 --> 01:11:53,500
of their support I was able to do this without any serious financial burden and you can see

993
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:57,700
their lovely names going up the screen now if you would like to join them and have early

994
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:02,300
access to videos like this and also finance some tougher ones that take a bit more effort

995
01:12:02,300 --> 01:12:05,220
to put together you can join my Patreon.

996
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,980
In addition to getting your name in the credits you'll get early access to videos plus lots

997
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:12,440
of other fun bonuses and extras as they come.
