0	4160	the overturning of Roe v. Wade will make abortion dramatically more difficult to obtain in the
4160	8400	United States, and young conservative commentators are saying things like this.
8400	11040	These feminists are so upset because they can't murder their children,
11040	12400	they can't offer them out to Molech.
12400	17920	That's Elijah Shafer. On his show Slightly Offensive, part of the Blaze Media Network,
17920	22880	a right-wing media network founded in part by former Fox News firebrand Glenn Beck.
22880	25920	And that's just the tip of the iceberg on the sort of stuff Shafer says.
25920	28800	People think that Australia is great because it's an all-white country,
28800	30560	and it's just that's the only reason why it's good.
30560	33680	And I don't, you can say that that's white supremacists, no, it's just it's a homogenous
33680	37840	group of people with less population than there is in California and a landmass bigger than the
37840	42160	United States. They get along, they don't commit crime, they're clean, and they have a common,
42160	43120	they have a common group.
43120	48480	You think in the last days that you would refuse the mark of the beast,
48480	52640	but you wouldn't even sacrifice being judged by your friends to not get a vaccine?
52640	57520	Craving for baby's blood has never been stronger. And when you look at this woman before us,
57680	59680	nobody is forcing you to be a whore.
59680	63600	Shafer is a strange breed of conservative commentator. He has the opinions of a
63600	68240	middle-aged right-wing white evangelical from the 1980s, but the style of an alt-right shit
68240	73680	poster from the mid 2010s. He embodies an inherent hybrid of where right-wing commentary is heading,
73680	77680	taking elements from previous conservative movements and coalescing them into this new
77680	82480	style of commentary. To understand Shafer's quick ascent in the conservative commentary space,
82480	86720	we have to go back and understand the rise of the religious right in American politics.
86800	91200	Now, we could go back to the likes of Father Coughlin or Norman Vincent Peale,
91200	95360	but instead let's start at the religious right's rise in the 1970s,
95360	99440	particularly in its fight against abortion and its push for family values.
100000	104320	While it's commonly believed that popular opposition to abortion is what galvanized
104320	108800	religious people to flock to the right, Randall Balmer, the John Phillips professor in religion
108800	113680	at Dartmouth College, conducted some research that presents a different picture. Paul Weyrich,
113680	117600	a religious conservative political activist and co-founder of the Heritage Foundation,
117600	122080	was hoping to capitalize on evangelical voters who had been slowly voting more frequently for
122080	126880	the Republican Party following the end of World War II. Weyrich believed that if he could organize
126880	133040	them on a mass scale, they would become a powerful voting bloc. Writing in the mid-1970s, Weyrich said,
133680	139120	the new political philosophy must be defined by us conservatives in moral terms, packaged in
139120	143600	non-religious language and propagated throughout the country by our new coalition. When political
143760	149200	power is achieved, the moral majority will have the opportunity to recreate this great nation.
149760	153600	Weyrich believed that if he could convince the leadership of evangelical and fundamentalist
153600	157920	Christian leaders to advocate for conservative politicians, their congregations would all
157920	162880	dutifully follow them in lockstep. And he floated a number of issues in their direction to catch the
162880	168080	interest of religious folks with little success. Early on, this did include abortion. According to
168080	173120	Balmer's research, evangelical leadership was largely indifferent to abortion. For example,
173120	178640	evangelical leader Jerry Falwell's first anti-abortion sermon wasn't until 1978,
178640	183920	five years after the 1973 Roe v. Wade verdict made abortion legal in the United States.
183920	188720	There are also examples of various evangelical leaders expressing indifference or even tepid
188720	193520	support of abortion. The rejection of abortion on religious moral grounds is something that actually
193520	198400	came a little bit later. What finally captured the attention of evangelical leadership to become
198400	203440	more involved in politics, though, was the Green v. Connolly ruling, which affirmed that a private
203440	207760	school which practiced racial discrimination could not be eligible for a tax exemption.
208320	213360	This impacted quite infamously Bob Jones University, which was a whites-only school.
214000	218640	With tax-exempt status at risk, evangelical leadership was very quick to take the side of
218640	223840	Bob Jones University, reframing the issue of being a whites-only school as a question of
223840	228560	religious freedom. The school argued that since it didn't take any federal money, aside from not
228560	232800	paying taxes, they shouldn't be expected to follow the same rules as public schools.
232800	238560	This didn't hold up in court. Bob Jones University lost its tax-exempt status and thus lit a fire
238560	242880	under evangelical leadership, and they soon began working with Wayrock and his allies to create an
242880	250080	evangelical floating block. Only, racial discrimination wasn't quite popular enough in the 1970s, at least
250080	255040	when it came to advocating that in public, so they started exploring other options. In 1978,
255040	259840	a leaflet campaign in Minnesota by Catholic organizers was credited with getting anti-abortion
259840	264240	candidates both senate seats, as well as the governorship, unlike evangelicals, right when
264240	268960	Catholics had been fighting against abortion for years. Although abortion as an issue hadn't worked
268960	273440	a few years prior, this success led Wayrock and his allies to rethink the tactic, and they started
273440	278240	brainstorming how this issue could be sold to evangelicals. As a reminder, Roe v. Wade was
278240	282880	five years old at this point. Anti-abortion sermons started being delivered and propaganda
282880	288000	started being produced, such as the film series Whatever Happened to the Human Race? Here's a
288000	300960	clip from that thing. As public sentiment among evangelicals began to change, anti-abortion took
300960	307040	its place among other issues this newly christened, moral majority would champion, including anti-gay
307040	312880	laws, christian prayer in school, among other things that would be labeled as family values.
312880	318560	This block solidified during the 1980s, and in that time the religious right would become a force in
318560	323360	American politics, often behind some of the most conservative social policies. They were accepted
323360	327600	into the Republican party, and they refused to a number of different conservative policies.
327600	331840	The religious right's influence can be heavily felt in the George W. Bush presidency, where
331840	337200	professions of faith were common, including very strong overtures to religious right concerns,
337200	343680	such as teaching creationism or generally being opposed to same-sex marriage. In the early years
343680	348080	of the Obama presidency, the Tea Party movement was very much an inheritor of this Christian right
348080	352240	movement. Though certain parts of the overall package waned over the years, such as prayer
352240	356960	in schools, the fight against abortion remained constant, and affirmation to that cause is one
356960	362160	of many reasons that led evangelicals to support Donald Trump in his bid for the presidency.
362160	366720	And this leads us back to Elijah Schaeffer. He's relatively new to this scene,
366720	372640	but he's an inheritor of this same brand of Christian conservatism. Born in 1993, Schaeffer
372640	377680	entered the world of right-wing commentary in the mid-2018s in his mid-20s. His years before that
377680	381680	were a combination of homeschooling and private schools, eventually graduating from a Christian
381680	386480	university in California with a degree in molecular biology. Which is very strange,
386480	391520	considering he doesn't believe in macroevolution. That is, the change in organisms that leads to the
391520	400800	development of new species. His critiques against evolution really don't have any substance,
400800	405840	and he gets to this vague, unanswerable question about why man is here, as this should somehow
405840	410720	completely overturn all the evidence which he seems to believe he's made a thorough examination
411040	414480	in the face of countless scientists working over the centuries.
430320	434560	You may have noticed in that answer a lack of specificity. This is something you'll be
434560	439120	seeing a lot as we go through Schaeffer's work, rambling that seems to be leading to a point,
439120	443440	but never quite gets there before being derailed by something else. For example,
443440	446720	when responding to his thoughts about evolution, here's where it ends up.
457920	462640	I should mention at this point Schaeffer claimed to be sober at the time this supposed possession
462640	467040	happened, though it did involve a friend who was on drugs at the time. Schaeffer himself has a
467040	472080	history with psychedelics and other drugs that cause hallucinations. While I have no real insight
472080	476320	into what happened to Schaeffer here, and I'm certainly not a doctor, I'm going to be bold and
476320	481440	suggest that he may have been experiencing hallucinogenic persisting perception disorder,
481440	486640	a hallucinogenic experience which has been known to happen sometimes years after a person has taken
486640	491440	hallucinogenic drugs. Or there could be a number of other scientific explanations here for what's
491440	497360	happening, or of course it is possible his friend was possessed by a literal demon that made its way
497360	501360	into Schaeffer's body. Feel free to make up your own mind on which of these is the most likely
501360	506080	outcome. Schaeffer credits Ben Shapiro with inspiring him to start a right-wing podcast,
506080	511040	although he wanted his style to be a bit different. He considered Ben Shapiro to be inoffensive and
511040	516240	more far-right provocateurs such as Milo Yiannopoulos to be offensive, and he wanted himself to be
516240	521680	somewhere in the middle, hence the title of his show, Slightly Offensive. The first iteration
521680	526000	of his show seems to have been lost to time. From how he described it in interviews, it was a series
526000	531200	of studio-based opinion segments, not unlike his later work. Eventually this was reshaped into the
531200	536240	mid-2018 version that still, at least partially, exists on his YouTube channel, where he would
536240	541040	attend left-wing protests to interview people in an attempt to make them look ignorant. A tried and
541040	544720	true technique practiced by Lawrence Southern, Steven Crowder, and various other right-wing
544720	549120	commentators. Schaeffer's production quality was higher than usual for these street interviews
549120	553600	because of his background working in commercial production. The actual quality of the interviews
553600	557520	left something to be desired though, with Schaeffer often talking over, interrupting,
557520	559920	and editing people to make them look as silly as possible.
574720	599920	In a video published on June 29, 2018, Schaeffer interviewed people at a women's
599920	604400	march. One of those people was a woman named Angie, who was kind enough to speak to me about
604400	629680	the experience. Angie is
629680	633360	one of several people who were featured in this video, and she describes the
633360	636320	experience of the backlash that followed her appearance there.
659680	688160	Angie would run into Schaeffer a few days later at another protest.
688240	694320	I saw them kind of cornering an older lady who, and I could see that she was getting animated
694320	701040	talking to him, and so I walked over and I said, you know, don't talk to him. He's gonna, you know,
701040	705040	he's gonna make you a target on the internet, basically. He said, you know, he went into
705040	709920	reasonable mode. He was like, you know, we're just trying to get all perspectives. I'm asking
709920	713440	questions. You know, he said, I thought we had a really good conversation the other day.
714160	720800	And I know that I kind of went off, not in an aggressive way, but in a way that was like,
720800	730240	I don't understand how you can present yourself like this, and then switch to putting out content
730240	737120	that you know is going to generate violent, hateful reactions. He's like, I don't condone
737120	741920	any of that. And he was like, I'll say it to camera right now. And he did a direct to camera,
741920	746720	you know, appeal to people to not make violent threats and all of that. The video was uploaded
746720	751200	unedited to Shafer's YouTube channel, and Angie noticed that her child was visible in the shot
751200	756000	where she had confronted him. Angie DM'd Shafer asking him to take the video down to protect her
756000	760560	child's safety, which he did eventually do, but there was an interesting part of her interaction
760560	768240	with him. He tried to be very complimentary about, you know, how I'd spoken, you know, he said,
768880	773680	we didn't edit you, and I usually edit people, and you were well spoken, so we let your words
773680	779600	just stand for themselves. And then he asked if I would be willing to do an interview with him.
781680	784960	He was like, you know, people were really responding to you, you know, trying to
786080	791440	stroke my ego or something. To Elijah Shafer, all of these appearances seem more like a game,
791440	795920	an attempt to puff up his political side while trying to find foils on the other side he could
796000	801120	film himself verbally jousting against. Something that's antithetical to actual journalism that
801120	805360	purports itself to be genuinely trying to understand the motivations and opinions of people
805360	809920	attending a protest. Here's an example of Shafer saying just that on an episode of Tim Pool's
809920	815680	podcast. A lot of people grift and they use field reporting sort of there's this way to get in front
815680	819600	of the camera, and their ultimate goal is they want to be a host. This is very common, right? I
819600	824160	happen to have had a podcast before I went out on the field myself. It's always been coinciding.
824160	828880	My podcast has always been about what I see on the field. So there's sort of that duplicity.
828880	833680	He describes it a bit more clearly here and how he doesn't see this as a grift. A lot of people,
833680	837680	like I said, use reporting to get the job that they want because I think generals are made in
837680	841840	the trenches. I don't think that's a grift per se. The problem with his reasoning though is that,
841840	846800	particularly in these early videos, he's not actually doing real reporting. He's going out
846800	851120	with a political goal to make these people he disagrees with politically look stupid.
851600	857200	As a result, these protests are framed as random assemblies of people who don't particularly know
857200	861520	why they're there or what they believe and who are deeply confused about the world around them.
861520	865280	It's at odds with other types of protest coverage where you might get clips like this.
865760	871200	Them people who are out there when they go back in the morning to get us jobs, get us loans,
871200	875520	get us, give us access, give us a chance. If we don't get no economic justice, we're still going
875520	878480	to be in a situation that we're walking around and police are going to be able to do whatever
878480	882640	they want to do to us. Or maybe something like this. I think there's an issue with people thinking
882640	887920	that this is solely an American thing. It's not an American thing solely. White supremacy is
887920	892400	worldwide and we need to acknowledge that a lot of the foundations for white supremacy in America
892400	898160	are built in the UK. These are interviews with people who have genuinely and firmly held beliefs
898160	901760	and what's more they give you an understanding of why people are attending these protests and what
901760	906240	they're hoping to achieve. You still may not agree with them but at the very least you understand
906240	910800	where they're coming from. Shafer was not interested in producing this type of understanding
910800	916240	but rather videos he could use for mockery. The goal of these videos isn't to build a resume of
916240	921680	genuine reporting to lead to the job of talk show host but rather conservative theater dressed up
921760	926720	as journalism that would lead to a job spouting out propaganda to advance a right-wing agenda.
926720	931360	These protest videos were an immediate success and Shafer was quickly embraced by the world of
931360	936000	right-wing media particularly because as Shafer describes himself they were used to target a
936000	941440	younger audience which the right-wing traditionally struggled with. My mission now is to bring the
941440	947760	truth to expose the truth and to do it in a way that attracts young people. Shafer's overt professions
947760	952480	of faith were present throughout his work in the early parts of his career as well. This may very
952480	956720	well have put him on the radar of the religious right establishment, at least the part of that
956720	961520	establishment that works in media, and he soon found himself with a plum spot working for Glenn
961520	966320	Beck. Glenn Beck quite famously made a name for himself railing against Barack Obama during his
966320	971200	first presidential term. His rise in conservative media was speaking to the Christian right. Here's
971200	980160	an example from his restoring honor rally from 2010. America today begins to turn back to God.
981520	986320	And here's another interesting clip from 2008 that reveals the specific audience Glenn Beck is
986320	991280	speaking to. I get so much email on this and I think a lot of people do and I've only got a
991280	998960	couple of seconds. Odds that Barack Obama is the Antichrist. No chance. First let's take a moment
998960	1003520	to applaud Glenn Beck for clearing the very low bar of saying that Barack Obama is not, in fact,
1003520	1008400	the Antichrist. But more important in that clip was him saying how often he had been asked that
1008400	1013360	question by his audience. This isn't a broad religious audience. He's cultivated, but rather
1013360	1018080	the conservative Christian audience that has been shaped from decades of propaganda, making them
1018080	1022960	tools of the Republican Party. One thing I should distinguish here is that Christianity in and of
1022960	1029600	itself is multifaceted with many denominations ascribing to a wide variety of political domains.
1029600	1035040	The group that follows and listens to the likes of Glenn Beck or Elijah Shafer, seeing their
1035040	1039840	Christianity reflected in their conservative activism, are a very specific subset that have
1039840	1044720	been cultivated and shaped by propaganda, making them the tools of conservative politicians.
1045280	1049440	Although it certainly is an interesting question as to how much of conservative politics is shaped
1049440	1054400	by the Christian right and vice versa, that's a bit outside the bounds for this video. Glenn Beck,
1054400	1059200	who faced a lot of outside pressure, including boycotts that negatively affected his advertising
1059200	1063920	at the time, eventually left Fox News, albeit ignoring an offer from the channel to keep him
1063920	1069040	on the air. Beck started his own media company, The Blaze, which would eventually become Blaze
1069040	1076080	Media in 2018 after a merger with Mark Levin's CRTV. The arrival of Blaze Media into Shafer's
1076080	1081040	career speaks to the institutional support right-wing figures such as himself have access to.
1081040	1085440	In the independent media space, it's a simple fact that the left is vastly underfunded,
1085440	1091040	particularly on YouTube. For every major operation, such as The Young Turks, you have Blaze Media,
1091040	1095360	The Daily Wire, and others who have multiple hosts and shows operating underneath them.
1095920	1100400	There are just way more opportunities on the right, with figures sometimes plucked from
1100400	1105360	obscurity and placed in positions of prominence, or for YouTubers who develop an audience and then
1105360	1109600	have their show folded into that network, with prominent examples being Steven Crowder,
1109600	1114640	Lauren Chen, and of course, Elijah Shafer. While working for Blaze Media, Shafer's profile would
1114640	1119760	continue to rise, perhaps most famously covering the Black Lives Matter protest throughout 2020.
1119760	1124160	His coverage was largely focused on spectacle more so than context and information. Though
1124160	1128160	Shafer did certainly conduct interviews, the stories that seemed to get the most play were
1128160	1132880	images of violence. This is where Shafer was ostensibly transitioning from someone who went
1132880	1136880	to protests to make people look stupid to reporting on the facts on the ground, though
1136880	1141360	he was often selective with the facts he chose to present. Here's how Shafer describes that
1141360	1147680	experience in an interview with Ali Beth Stuckey from 2021. It seemed that almost like God's hand
1147680	1154320	was on my life to put me in the worst situations possible, but to protect me. And here's one
1154320	1160400	specific incident they mention. The group of people nearly killing a man, splitting his head
1160400	1165280	open with the skateboard trucks and laughing and people spitting on him and then watching after they
1165280	1170640	broke. That was in Dallas. I think I remember this. This was a guy trying to defend a business
1170640	1175200	against the rioters with a machete and then the rioters basically bashed his head in until he
1175200	1179440	was unconscious, right? It's interesting how Stuckey provided the additional context here
1179440	1183600	because it mimics what went wrong with Shafer's coverage of this event. When Shafer posted this
1183600	1188640	video on Twitter in May of 2020, it showed a scene of about five or six people attacking a
1188640	1193040	man lying helpless on the ground while a dozen more stood around watching and shouting. I can't
1193040	1196800	play the clip because of YouTube's restrictions on violent footage, but it's linked below if you'd
1196800	1201920	like to check it out. The video was viewed 35 million times, and though there's some text
1201920	1206640	providing a bit of context, it's obviously positioned to portray this man as an innocent victim.
1206640	1211680	The narrative was pounced on by conservative media, eventually filtering its way up to President Trump.
1212320	1218880	Innocent people have been savagely beaten like the young man in Dallas, Texas who was left dying
1218880	1224080	on the street. About an hour and a half after this video was first posted, Shafer made another
1224080	1228800	tweet with a longer version of the video, where 18 additional seconds revealed that this beating
1228800	1233760	was immediately preceded by this man screaming while swinging a machete as he charged towards
1233760	1244320	the group that would eventually attack him. This video was viewed 3.7 million times. The second
1244320	1248640	tweet also reveals that he has no idea if this guy was the owner of the story he was supposedly
1248640	1252960	defending or even what his name is, but he does assure his audience that this man, who showed up
1252960	1258400	to protest with the machete, was not the instigator that night. Here's a statement on the event from
1258400	1263440	Dallas Police. According to witnesses, the individual who came to the protest wheeled on a large knife
1263760	1267840	slash machete at several protesters. An unknown protester was attempting to fight off this
1267840	1272000	individual by using his skateboard and was subsequently cut in the hand, but not before
1272000	1276800	disarming the individual. At this time, the crowd of protesters began assaulting the individual.
1276800	1281280	As mentioned, the individual with the large knife was taken to the hospital and was last reported to
1281280	1285840	be in stable condition. Neither the individual who was cut in the hand nor anyone in the way of the
1285840	1290320	knife-wielding individual have come forward to file the complaint. Another video taken at night
1290400	1296080	by a student, Yul Myasho, showed the event from another angle. Here's an excerpt from the
1296080	1300880	Intercept article that spoke to him. In a phone interview, Myasho said that he started recording
1300880	1304960	just after the man with the machete pulled it out and threatened the skateboarder who was slightly
1304960	1309520	ahead of the rest of the group. Myasho insisted that, although glass was broken at hatchways at
1309520	1314400	some point on Saturday night, there was no violence or looting of any kind when the man confronted the
1314400	1319040	skateboarder. A fuller examination of the facts revealed that this man with the machete to be less
1319040	1324400	an innocent victim and more active participant in escalating tensions that night. A flatter reading
1324400	1329600	of this situation might be that a man showed up to a Black Lives Matter protest brandishing a machete
1329600	1334400	in a threatening fashion. When protesters started throwing trash at him to get him to go away,
1334400	1339520	he instead decided to charge at them screaming while swinging around the machete. The protesters
1339520	1345040	responded by disarming him and then attacking him. It doesn't make any of what happened that night
1345120	1349200	right, but it does reveal that Shafer had a very specific agenda when he edited the footage to
1349200	1354160	remove that context. He very much wanted his audience to see Black Lives Matter protesters as
1354160	1359920	unthinking mindless vandals attacking helpless individuals who are trying to protect businesses,
1359920	1365280	eliminating any context that might present this individual as reckless and irresponsible.
1365280	1369520	Shafer's perspective appears to be colored by his own biases against the protesters and his own
1369520	1373520	personal conservative religious perspective. The way that they were pushing for everything
1373520	1378960	demonic to change their gender, to explore their sexuality, and the way that they expressed that
1378960	1385280	together of like, let's get together and let's do evil things. Let's hurt people. Let's kill people.
1385280	1391120	Let's steal things. Let's destroy things. I mean, there is no other way to describe the energy there
1391680	1396960	than purely satanic from hell. Here's another story Shafer mentioned in this interview. You
1396960	1401440	know, someone had just put a gun into my face and I think the gun jammed or they pulled the
1401440	1406400	trigger and it's on footage. This footage of someone apparently trying to murder Shafer
1406400	1412320	can be found on his Twitter account in a five second clip he posted. What do we do? That's right.
1413280	1417760	Whoa, that's right, man. It's hard to really know what's going on with five seconds taken out of
1417760	1422560	what was likely a much longer day of filming, but let's deal with the obvious problem here.
1422560	1428720	Pointing a gun at someone, even an unloaded one, is incredibly reckless and should not be condoned.
1428720	1432560	Regardless of what anyone might think of Shafer and what he's arrived to do there,
1432560	1437760	pointing a gun at the guy is clearly out of bounds. I would like to note that this irresponsible
1437760	1442400	behavior, though, doesn't quite match how Shafer presented it in the interview. Even though it was
1442400	1446240	reckless, it does appear to have been done for dramatic effect and doesn't really seem like
1446240	1451200	someone is trying to kill him. Shafer himself even said as much when speaking to Fox News at the time.
1452000	1456320	I don't think he pointed the gun at me to try to kill me. I think he was one of the stupidest people
1456320	1460480	in the world. In a video posted four days after those comments were published, he said this to
1460480	1465840	Mark Levin. All I can credit is God for that. I'm really true. I'm not trying to be a martyr here.
1465840	1470160	I'm not saying I'm special. I'm not saying I actually was going to die. But the fact that as
1470160	1476160	we just saw last night, it's very, very probable and possible that you can die at these things.
1476160	1480880	This is a pattern with much of Shafer's reporting. Footage, often very heavily edited,
1480880	1485440	is presented in a deliberate effort to frame protesters as violent or dangerous.
1485520	1489680	And the story is less about the reasons for violence at these demonstrations and instead
1489680	1494720	Shafer inserting himself into the narrative as a victim. He is showing up to these protests,
1494720	1499360	not as a neutral presence, but as someone who is being targeted by the left and therefore
1499360	1503440	their opposition. That group right there that was assaulting me with their camera that was coming
1503440	1508880	up to me. This is all very ironic because as much as he may talk about how dangerous violence from
1508880	1514080	protesters are, he does describe the most debilitating injury he got as being not from
1514080	1518960	left wing protesters, but rather the police. Department of Homeland Security is the one who's
1518960	1525040	hurt me the worst, not actually Antifa. What was the situation? It was at the federal courthouse
1525040	1529840	and they just shot with a gas powered like point blank with a like whatever flash being in my
1529840	1535200	shin and just cracked open my shin. It's strange how he fixates on the left being dangerous and
1535200	1540640	out of control. But when the police injure him, that doesn't lead to any thought about how heavily
1540640	1545360	armed the police are and the way in which they deploy that force against unarmed people.
1545360	1550080	By framing himself as a victim, Shafer is vilifying the left, something he was doing
1550080	1554320	in his earlier work as well. Contriving conversations to make protesters look bad
1554320	1559760	just turned into making himself a victim, also to vilify the protesters. And while there might be
1559760	1565120	an interesting conversation as to how we understand violence that happens at demonstrations,
1565120	1570080	or how some people who attend protests may not have the best or most well thought out takes,
1570080	1574640	the issue I really want to focus on is that Shafer is clearly and obviously operating with
1574640	1580000	an agenda. He is not a neutral journalist or reporter in any sense of the word, he is showing
1580000	1586240	up to be a propagandist. And this is very explicitly a religious political operation for him.
1586240	1589760	The narratives that have been given to the people in the church are progressive narratives,
1589760	1593920	they come from Satan, they're from the mouth of Beezlebug himself. And if you still somehow think
1593920	1598160	Shafer is acting like a journalist, here he is on his show describing why he highlights
1598160	1602480	specific footage of people at protests. Well, people say, well, why do you film these people?
1602480	1606640	It is genuinely to publicly mock them. And it is because it works.
1606640	1610080	Mockery is the point. This isn't journalism, it's propaganda.
1610720	1616080	There was one notable exception in Shafer's career though, when he quite famously attended
1616080	1620800	the January 6th Capitol riot where hundreds of Trump supporters broke into the Capitol building
1620800	1625920	in an effort to overturn the democratic election of Joe Biden. At the time, Shafer seemed almost
1625920	1631120	jubilant, as he described it as a revolution in progress, and he took some heat for photographing
1631120	1636320	a computer screen in Nancy Pelosi's office. At the time, Shafer did have some less than comforting
1636320	1641280	words for Trump supporters. The Trump supporters that are denying that Trump supporters could do
1641280	1646960	this, I mean, have you not heard the sentiments from people who follow Trump? I mean, they are
1646960	1652000	pissed, they are upset. I made a whole video on Tucker Carlson's Patriot Purge series,
1652000	1656240	but I want to highlight one section where Shafer appears. This time, his tone towards
1656240	1661840	Trump supporters has changed a bit. January 6th was just, you know, mom and dad who were mad
1661840	1666720	about what they saw to be an election that they thought was unfair, rigged, fortified, stolen. It
1666720	1670480	doesn't matter what you say it is, they were just angry and a lot of them just got caught up in the
1670480	1675280	front lines of chaos. They thought that rioting was like a game, maybe. Supposedly, the violence
1675280	1681680	of January 6th is excused as manipulation by the FBI of innocent Trump supporters, but violence
1681760	1688640	at a BLM protest is some kind of demonic presence on earth. Throughout 2020 and 2021, Shafer
1688640	1693280	transitioned to doing more in-studio work, hosting Slightly Offensive and You Are Here,
1693280	1698480	with the latter being co-hosted by right-wing commentator Sydney Watson. This part of Shafer's
1698480	1703600	career starts to get really nasty, and he spends less time on the illusion of grappling with the
1703600	1708640	idea of his political opponents and instead mocking their appearance. They cut their breasts off,
1708720	1713440	they have scars, they all look like Hillary Clinton after she lost another election,
1713440	1717760	butch haircuts, depression in the eyes, and you just go, man, if you were living a life
1717760	1722080	that led to wholeness, why do you look like that? Many of his videos include moments like that,
1722080	1726880	picking out random people, often videos circulated by the ellipse of TikTok Twitter account,
1726880	1731360	which he notes as a friend of his, and mocking their appearance. Here's another example.
1731360	1736640	I love that we all got to go to the zoo for free today. You saw a couple of hippopotamuses and then
1736640	1741840	an elephant in the beginning. It always is the women who are incapable of naturally getting
1741840	1747440	impregnated that have the most complaints about abortion. Much of his content is just this vicious
1747440	1751920	bullying of random people on the internet with no real power. At this point in his career,
1751920	1757760	it's the main tool Shafer uses, although there is an alternative he mentions. Somebody asked me,
1757760	1760960	they think the only other alternative is like violence. So it's like you could either A,
1760960	1766160	mock the people or B, kill them. And I'm going to say there's two options. One of them is illegal
1766160	1770240	and you'll go to prison. The other one, you get to have a show and you get to collect Barbies.
1770240	1774800	So, you know, I take, I'll take the first one in the moment and I try to avoid the violence
1774800	1778400	for as long as possible in life. It's kind of him to say he's willing to avoid violence
1779040	1784960	for the moment. And this brings us to Kyle Rittenhouse. Rittenhouse and Shafer are bros,
1784960	1789520	and Shafer quite infamously interviewed Rittenhouse shortly before he killed two men and wounded
1789520	1795120	another at a BLM demonstration. And afterwards, he was quickly branded a conservative hero.
1795120	1800000	After Rittenhouse was found not guilty of murder, he appeared on Shafer's You Are Here show
1800000	1805920	for a conversation that can be described as very friendly. This interview is not an easy watch,
1805920	1810880	largely because there's far too much discussion about all the women Rittenhouse wants to have sex
1810880	1815520	with. The main purpose, though, is summed up by Shafer here. Just it's just cool to know,
1815520	1820320	though, that you are a real person, that you're not a meme. Shafer wanted to humanize Rittenhouse,
1820320	1824880	to reaffirm to his far right audience that in spite of the fact that Rittenhouse will supposedly
1824880	1830240	claim to support BLM, at the end of the day, Rittenhouse is one of their guys, a tool to be
1830240	1834560	wielded against the left, because he's willing to use violence against their political opposition.
1834560	1838160	It's why another running theme through this interview is the jovial celebration of the
1838160	1843120	violence committed by Rittenhouse. And you were armed, and unlike some people that that that
1843120	1847680	fateful night, they didn't listen to the directions of somebody with a firearm, but I was smart
1847680	1858160	enough. And when I mention Shafer having a far right audience, this will become increasingly
1858160	1863760	clear as we examine the topics and talking points that he uses. The right wing embrace of Rittenhouse
1863760	1869200	is not a product of someone acting in self defense in and of itself, but rather for taking violent
1869200	1875200	action against political opposition. Had Rittenhouse been, as is often framed, defending himself in a
1875200	1880000	completely different setting with no political dimension, say the parking lot of them all, I
1880000	1885520	suspect he would not be so readily embraced by the right wing. The fact that he was defending himself
1885520	1890080	in the midst of a Black Lives Matter protest against those who were on that particular side
1890080	1895040	of the political divide is precisely why he's heralded as a hero. It's about normalizing
1895040	1901200	violence against the political opposition. Elijah Shafer is, as I've hopefully demonstrated at this
1901200	1905600	point, a religious ideologue who will tacitly endorse violence against his opposition, from
1905600	1910720	celebrating Kyle Rittenhouse to creating a false dichotomy of mockery or violence, to casting his
1910720	1916720	opponents as literal demons. The implication is the same. The other side of the political spectrum
1916720	1923120	is deserving of violence, and should be seen as inherently evil. He's not explicitly saying
1923120	1928160	people should be violently attacked, but he understands and sympathizes with that approach,
1928240	1932640	and he might even call you a hero if you do it. But there's more to this guy than religiously
1932640	1938800	motivated violence. He also has some issues with the LGBT community. Here he is making what I
1938800	1954240	assume are jokes. I can't speak for the gay community myself, but I am offended on behalf
1954240	1960320	of anyone who enjoys comedy for that exchange. These jokes aren't entirely stylistic, though.
1960320	1965120	Shafer uses humor much in the way the alt-right used irony and sarcasm to mask their true intent,
1965120	1970240	and charismatically attract a younger audience who appreciate edgy jokes, even if it's more edge
1970240	1975520	than joke. I don't know if this is a deliberate tactic Shafer is using, or if it's just his brand
1975520	1980640	of humor, but it does explain his success regardless. Painful attempts at homophobic humor
1980640	1985600	aside, and there are countless jokes Shafer makes about being gay, he does eventually let slip what
1985600	1990800	his real concerns are. Thirteen-year-olds like this guy he would argue should look at porn, and so
1990800	1994080	what's the difference of looking at porn or getting involved in a sexual confrontation with
1994080	1998800	an adult online, and I think that they're planning ahead decades so that they can have sex with kids
1998800	2003920	in the metaverse? That's where I think we're headed. They, whoever they are, are playing a
2003920	2009920	very long game by normalizing pedophilia now so they can have sex with kids in the metaverse
2009920	2015200	in the future. The logic of this plan escapes me, as it's weird that these supposed groomers are
2015200	2020160	expecting to still be virile enough 30 years into the future. This is an example of how Shafer
2020160	2026320	analyzes the news. He connects a vague fear of big tech with a groomer conspiracy theory to shape
2026320	2032160	nonsensical narratives, narratives that are very evocative of old Christian conservative arguments.
2032800	2036800	The groomer narrative that has been so popular on the right lately has been something Shafer has
2036880	2042080	been exposing for a while. Here he is talking about it in 2021. Even with the gay pride stuff,
2042080	2045680	originally it was like dude don't you just want gay people to be able to do what they want to do
2045680	2050160	in their closet? And you're like okay fine go ahead and then now it's like yeah if you want
2050160	2054560	them to have sex with your kid you're the bigot. None of these ideas are new and Shafer's opinions
2054560	2059280	are just regurgitated right-wing propaganda. This same rhetoric was used to attack the gay
2059280	2066000	community for decades. Here's an example from 1961's Boys Beware. Jimmy didn't know was that
2066000	2072880	Ralph was sick. A sickness that was not visible like smallpox but no less dangerous and contagious.
2072880	2079920	A sickness of the mind. You see Ralph was a homosexual. A person who demands an intimate
2079920	2086480	relationship with members of their own sex. 60 years later the message is the same. People outside
2086480	2091280	the cis heterosexual category should be considered dangerous. Here are some examples of Shafer's
2091280	2097120	rhetoric getting even more extreme. They want what they cannot have or the last bastion besides
2097120	2100640	forcibly raping and killing the kids while you have sex with them which is eventually where they
2100640	2105440	want to go right. And in this very video he ends with a particularly chilly note. You want me to
2105440	2110800	say your pronouns? Ask me if I care if you died today. I literally don't care. You could literally
2110800	2115680	get hit by a bus and the world would be boom. And here he is being even more explicit responding
2115680	2120880	to a video that discusses how to use more inclusive language to describe intersex people.
2120880	2125360	My advice is to use language that focuses on function and not just form. That means focusing
2125360	2129200	on the actual function that you're talking about such as people who can get pregnant,
2129200	2133200	people who can get other people pregnant, people who are at risk of testicular cancer and so on
2133200	2137360	and so forth. Where's Kyle Rittenhouse when you need him? You know that's all when I watch these
2137360	2143920	people I have no other thoughts. You are to me a potential child molester and you are a
2143920	2148240	child predator. You are a threat and threats need to be neutralized. Yeah and we don't advocate
2148240	2152880	for killing people. I mean Drew Hernandez immediately has to help Shafer walk back these
2152880	2158000	comments. Though saying someone needs to be neutralized has a pretty clear implication.
2158000	2162640	Elijah Shafer thinks trans and non-binary people's lives aren't worth caring about
2162640	2168880	and if they make their identities visible around children they should be, in his words, neutralized.
2168880	2174400	What makes all of this moral panic so unconvincing is how it fixates on members of the LGBT community.
2174480	2179360	Overwhelmingly, child predators are straight and cisgender. Something that's obviously true when
2179360	2184080	you consider the relative size of populations being discussed. If discussions of sexuality around
2184080	2188560	children marks someone as a groomer, most of the efforts should be focused on stopping straight
2188560	2193920	cisgender people from mentioning their sexuality around children. Never mind, gender identity is
2193920	2199360	actually distinct from sexuality and is relatively harmless when being discussed around anybody.
2199840	2205120	But of course there is no discussion around displays of heterosexual sexuality around children
2205120	2209920	because this was never about protecting children. It was about demonizing trans and non-binary
2209920	2214480	people the same way it was used and continues to be used against gay people. The religious right
2214480	2219440	has long been a political adversary to the LGBT community and Shafer is once again perfectly
2219440	2224880	happy to take up that cause, even endorsing violence on the basis of a lie. This isn't the
2224960	2230080	only community Shafer has a problem with though. For example, he quite infamously tweeted this out,
2230080	2235520	I despise the Chinese so much because I was with them my whole life. We always had exchange
2235520	2240800	students. Even as an adult, my roommates were rich Chinese pretending to care about education.
2240800	2246080	I know what few will admit. They are our enemies. It's competition. You're the dumb one.
2246720	2250880	This tweet was deleted but he still has several up clarifying his position.
2250880	2256400	Chinese citizens rape our system to use it against us. Sorry the haters don't realize this.
2256400	2262320	They admit this to me. Only Twitter people pretend this isn't true. Americans who are Asian are my
2262320	2266960	friend but CCP funded plants are not. I'm aware of the difference and don't care about your
2266960	2272320	political correctness. Our nations are at war and I'm not playing nice. There were several other
2272320	2276880	tweets like this and I hope those were clear enough. This goes beyond being opposed to the
2276880	2282160	government of China and extends that opposition to all Chinese nationals. Shafer sees them as
2282160	2286560	enemies as if every Chinese person is an unthinking pawn of their government and no
2286560	2292000	independent thought exists there in a country of over one billion people. There's no other way
2292000	2297200	to see this than bigotry against the Chinese but this is a bit more insidious than that as we look
2297200	2301520	deeper into Shafer's comments on immigration because it gets at the heart of another issue
2301520	2306640	he's talking about. That he's very concerned that the United States of America is becoming less white.
2306880	2311680	Here's a clip of him expressing that in a 2021 video on Tim Pool's podcast.
2311680	2315280	One thing that I can agree with critical race theory on is they do say that America was made
2315280	2320480	by white people for white people and I've read the documents and before 1965 it specifically
2320480	2325120	states like for our posterity when the immigration laws were changed when we had this similar
2325120	2329920	biosphere and there was there was this majority of people in every nation whether it's religion,
2329920	2334880	race, it's culture, there has to be shared value and we were sold this future for America which
2334880	2338960	was a total scam and I believe had communist influence. What Shafer is referring to here is
2338960	2344320	the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, a topic that is very much a pain point among
2344320	2348880	white nationalists. This federal law abolished quotas on immigration that were established in
2348880	2353600	the 1920s which were designed to maintain a specific ethnic diversity of the country.
2353600	2359360	In other words the law Shafer so upset about was done to counter another law that was explicitly
2359360	2364080	racist which was designed to keep non-white people from immigrating to the United States.
2364640	2369680	Shafer favors a law that ensures the country remains overwhelmingly white which means that
2369680	2375680	particular group would hold all the political power. This is I think quite obviously a white
2375680	2380720	nationalist talking point. In this conversation Shafer tries to deflect this obviously racist
2380720	2385120	point he's making to claim he's worried about some kind of communist plot to overthrow the
2385120	2390640	country. This conspiracy theory is a rambling mess that doesn't really make sense. Eventually Shafer
2390720	2395520	gets called out by Tim Poole for making a racist argument and I can't believe I just said that.
2395520	2399760	Number one reason why I'm saying why expats don't fit in is because in America it's seen as being
2399760	2403760	really great to share your political views you actually are like seen as sort of being brave
2403760	2408320	and in Japan you will be ostracized. There's a word for that. They're racist. Well how is that
2408320	2414320	racism if Japan is literally racist they're an ethno state and they do not they they don't. How
2414320	2419840	is that racism of a homogeneous Japanese culture wanting to preserve a certain ethnic group? About
2419840	2424880	a year later we see more of Shafer's thoughts on immigration describing security at the border.
2424880	2428080	Like like the border situation right we can't figure out what to do with people catch and release
2428080	2432640	title 42. We don't know what's going on like it is hard to know what to do but in the end there
2432640	2435680	has been situations where people have taken a similar approach they got the shit beat out of
2435680	2440160	them like knocked out hypothetically so you get beat up you get shot or whatever. I don't know if
2440160	2444080	that's the solution and if it's on YouTube and you look it up but it's also the fact is that some
2444080	2447760	people have taken that approach of like just going to violence and to be honest it worked.
2447760	2452560	The comfort Shafer has with discussing violence this time referring to people crossing the border
2452560	2457600	illegally is worrying but of course it doesn't end there. Shafer has a history of sharing white
2457600	2463280	nationalist memes like this one below using the black sun symbol a symbol by the way which was
2463280	2468480	used by the recent racist massed shooter in buffalo who deliberately targeted black people.
2468480	2473760	More than sharing memes and talking points Shafer has made other overtures to the extreme far right.
2473760	2477520	Anytime slander comes from the media I'm like that person is probably cool like hey
2477520	2482480	that's a that's a nazi I'm like let me go speak to which brings us to Elijah Shafer's on air
2482480	2487280	conversations with Nick Fuentes. If you're not familiar with the name I recommend this video
2487280	2492960	from Mildred of the Goo Realm who details how Nick Fuentes pushes fascism from his weird
2492960	2498000	little corner of the internet into the mainstream. Fuentes had a YouTube channel until it was banned
2498000	2502960	for hate speech and this article has a helpful comment on Fuentes's view on white nationalism.
2502960	2506720	The reason I wouldn't call myself a white nationalist it's not because I don't see
2506720	2510480	the necessity for white people to have a homeland and for white people to have a country
2510480	2516240	it's because I think that kind of terminology is used almost exclusively by the left into fame and
2516240	2521200	I think the terminology and the labels that we use I don't think that we can look at them outside of
2521200	2526880	the context of their connotations in America. Fuentes very deliberately and carefully crafts
2526880	2532320	his image to be as far right as possible while still having a degree of plausible deniability
2532320	2537120	or at least plausible to anyone who isn't paying close attention to the fascism he's obviously
2537120	2541920	trying to push. One notable moment in Fuentes's career was when he decided to ambush Ben Shapiro
2541920	2546480	in the middle of the street when he was with his family and while anyone familiar with this channel
2546480	2550800	knows I have no love for Ben Shapiro aside from his wonderful fiction about political correctness
2550800	2555920	leading to a nuclear bomb going off I do think it's incredibly disrespectful and gross to confront
2555920	2561680	him and put his family including his children on camera. Although certainly not the worst thing
2561680	2566240	Fuentes has ever done I wanted to bring it up because his cameraman that day happened to be
2566240	2571440	Elijah Shafer. And that footage that we just saw that interaction with Ben I happen to have filmed
2571440	2576560	and I guess this means that we have a history of being around the same circles. What's interesting
2576560	2580560	about this interview is not just that Shafer is having a friendly chat with a white nationalist
2580560	2585600	but that he has actively participated in something Fuentes has been very vocal about with his tactics
2585600	2590240	finding ways to soften his extreme rhetoric to make it more appealing to a wide audience.
2590240	2594800	Shafer interviewed Fuentes twice that day once on his slightly offensive show and then
2594800	2600480	on You Are Here. The You Are Here one is a bit tough to watch as Shafer's co-host Sydney Watson
2600480	2605040	makes it clear she had never heard of Fuentes and she seems a bit shaken by some of his opinions.
2605040	2610080	The old world the old way of doing things. Women don't drive don't vote type of thing or something
2610080	2614800	like that I mean approximating like Saudi Arabia I don't think they're too far off the mark. I mean
2614800	2620000	you could potentially go and live in Saudi Arabia then. Watson is not up to the task of pushing back
2620000	2624320	in a meaningful way against Fuentes even when he's talking about taking away all of her rights
2624320	2628720	and towards the end of the interview she says this. It's really funny people are like Sydney's
2628720	2632080	really triggered and I'm honestly just sitting here just listening and just you know getting a
2632080	2636400	feel for things but I was saying to Elijah it's interesting I think you're being very respectful
2636400	2640800	and it's and I think that's really nice because people make you out to be this you know assassin
2640800	2646080	that's going to just stab everybody in the face. So while Fuentes may want to turn her into a
2646080	2651120	second-class citizen reducing her to an incubator for children Watson appreciates that he's at least
2651120	2657040	willing to have a civil conversation about it so that's lovely. Shafer takes the opposite approach
2657040	2661600	not in that he more aggressively pushes back against Fuentes so much as he's interested in
2661600	2668640	coaching him. Here's a quick example you know 3.8 billion dollars per year for Israel and and all
2668640	2674320	of this you know how how can you really say you're America first if you're so fixated on the benefit
2674320	2677600	of another country and she would. Can I ask you a question there though before you even give her
2677600	2681680	answer is like so when you say this this is where a lot of people I think get turned off even these
2681680	2686720	kind of questions because obviously I know where this is headed is like was your was your question
2686720	2691840	just on foreign aid in general or did you see something like I could question a foreign aid
2691840	2696880	but not to this country. This is a very astute place to cut Fuentes off what could have turned
2696880	2702560	into a very anti-Semitic rant is quickly reframed to sound like Fuentes is just concerned about
2702560	2707600	foreign aid as if there's nothing about Israel or the Jewish people Fuentes has a problem with.
2707600	2712160	The briefest of glances into Fuentes's history reveals numerous anti-Semitic statements and
2712160	2716400	beliefs it's almost trivial to find clips of him jokingly denying the Holocaust or saying the
2716400	2722400	Jewish people aren't part of western civilization or how he has concerns over Jewish power and while
2722400	2728160	I'm citing this ADL article to demonstrate Fuentes's anti-Semitic past Shafer himself actually pulled
2728160	2732000	it up during his interview with Fuentes and addressed it like this. There's nowhere like
2732000	2735760	here's where Nick Fuentes beat up a black guy and said the n-word like there's nothing like this
2735760	2741600	it's just these these ideas like he wants to fight against transgenderism like well I do too
2741600	2746480	so and then everyone watching this is like yeah yeah you know it's that's cool then they go Fuentes
2746480	2750880	has used his platform to make numerous anti-Semitic and racist comments so you didn't do anything
2750880	2756000	racist or anti-Semitic you made jokes in here and said some things you said some bad things
2756000	2759760	apparently according to these standards I'm just saying what it says. It's really something
2759760	2764960	watching Shafer in real time not actually engaging with any of the evidence cited but gently
2764960	2769120	hand waving it away given his audience the impression that he's providing a rebuttal
2769120	2774560	the incredibly racist and anti-Semitic jokes aren't considered racist because Fuentes didn't
2774560	2780320	literally beat up a black guy while shouting the n-word also they aren't jokes here's a tweet
2780320	2785760	Fuentes makes that Shafer doesn't acknowledge at all any serious person thinking about globalization
2785760	2790720	and demographic changes should actually care a lot about racial differences in intelligence
2790720	2795840	but this subject doesn't interest you because it's not convenient for your Trojan horse brand of
2795840	2802400	kosher nationalism that's not a joke and neither is this comment from Shafer wants to preserve
2802400	2806880	white identity I guess in some way and Christianity which is like not very extreme ideas these are
2806880	2811760	just like it's just apolitical ideology it's one of many that are out there right calling Fuentes's
2811760	2818400	ideas which are white nationalist ideas one of many is certainly true personally I would
2818400	2822960	consider someone tried to make America more like Saudi Arabia including take away the rights of
2822960	2830080	women to be fairly extreme Fuentes is a fascist but this coaching isn't just for the benefit of
2830080	2835120	Fuentes it also helps train his audience as well I'm going to play a short clip from the podcast
2835120	2839040	I Don't Speak German that went over this very interaction the voice you'll be hearing is from
2839040	2843920	one of its co-hosts Jack Graham the job is educating the audience in how you say these
2843920	2850000	things now it's it's like an it's like a course in not just the the ideology but in the how you
2850000	2854560	present that ideology aesthetically now if you listen to enough of this stuff you imbibe this
2854560	2859760	you learn how to say it I spend a lot of time going over Elijah Shafer in this video and well
2859760	2864720	yeah I think he sucks I also want to highlight how his success is not purely a product of his
2864720	2869600	own talents he was discovered by people with far more power than he and then given a platform to
2869600	2874080	broadcast his beliefs because those are the sorts of beliefs that these people want to shape the
2874080	2880640	public discourse as for who they are in this case he was hired by religious conservative Glenn Beck
2880640	2885120	who rose to prominence because he tapped into a religious rights anti-left-wing sentiment
2885120	2890560	something that was cultivated over decades by conservative politics Elijah Shafer will not be
2890640	2895600	the last of these guys to appear this is a system designed to weaponize religious conservatism
2895600	2901120	against the left and to advance a broader right-wing agenda it's one that's dependent on bringing in
2901120	2907200	voices who espouse a specific worldview and then networking together to overall push this greater
2907200	2912640	message of religious conservatism and what Shafer might be learning now is that that system
2912640	2918400	doesn't care about him it just finds him useful while I was working on this video Shafer's co-host
2918400	2923920	on You Are Here Sydney Watson decided to leave the show while Watson will continue on with Blaize
2923920	2929360	Media it seems she will not be working alongside Shafer anymore Shafer's reaction on twitter was
2930080	2936320	not great shortly afterwards Shafer made a tweet about Mormons Mormons are not Christians very nice
2936320	2942560	people love them much of my family are LDS but they are going to hell not followers of truth
2942560	2947760	makes me sad but can't deny the gospel I struggle in many ways too so can't condemn
2948320	2953280	but can't pretend their faith isn't already condemned this got a response from Elijah
2953280	2960560	Shafer's very Mormon boss Glen Beck Elijah thank goodness you know the truth assuming I'm one of
2960560	2965680	the many nice people who the Lord has made clear to you is condemned I just need to know if you
2965680	2971280	still want a guy who is going to hell as a mentor Shafer effectively doubled down on his initial
2971280	2976560	tweet and I can't imagine saying your boss is going to hell is the best career move but this
2976560	2980400	isn't new for Shafer he's spoken many times about how he's gotten in trouble for comments in the
2980400	2985120	past and how he ruffles feathers with his brazen attitude he even has this habit of making these
2985120	2990560	really sad comments about how he's all alone and has lost so many of his friends yeah and now I have
2990560	2996560	like one friend and it's Pamela Anderson my life that she gives me pleasure about but no but I just
2996560	3000560	meant genuinely as a joke like I was like I've just I've lost pretty much everybody in the last
3000560	3005200	year and I you know so I'm just where I'm at now it's just me in my little home studio and here we
3005200	3011120	are but but the my slightly offensive like absolutely killing it and all my social like
3011120	3014560	everything's just growing and doing well so like I'm like I've never been doing better financially
3014560	3018800	Shafer has some skill in the game he's playing but maybe it's not enough to create a meaningful
3018800	3023680	career and maybe he'll burn out a few short years after starting and then he'll be replaced by the
3023680	3028880	next guy willing to say and do all the things Shafer does though perhaps not quite as earnestly
3028880	3033440	after all it's not about the influencers it's about maintaining that system of power that is
3033440	3039200	animated in part by Christian nationalism and that system of power was never built for the
3039200	3045280	people at the very bottom but rather the people at the very top this video could not have been
3045280	3051040	completed without the very helpful assistance of Daniel Harper the other co-host of the I Don't
3051040	3056880	Speak German podcast I highly recommend it they've done several videos touching on people like Shafer
3056880	3062960	but they specialize on a lot of far right figures shedding light on some really dark disturbing
3062960	3067520	corners of the internet so if you enjoy those sorts of videos uh about those kinds of topics
3067520	3072000	on my channel I very much recommend checking out their podcast it's really well done and has a lot
3072000	3077520	of information you often won't be hearing anywhere else if you'd like to see more videos like this
