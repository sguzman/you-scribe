0	7000	Today we're talking about dinosaurs.
31000	36000	Set 60 million years in the past, though only premiering in 1991,
36000	40000	Dinosaurs takes us back to a time when dinosaurs ruled the world,
40000	42000	and it looks a lot like how we humans rule the world.
42000	49000	Working a dead-end job, managing a household, and going to school in this thing we like to call a society.
49000	52000	Most notably for its striking use of full-body puppets,
52000	57000	this series was a hit when it arrived and then vanished quickly, lasting the scant four seasons.
57000	61000	The look of these puppets should be familiar to anyone at all aware of the work of Jim Henson,
61000	65000	famed puppeteer who created the Muppets and the residents of Sesame Street.
65000	68000	The show was created by his studio, Jim Henson Productions,
68000	72000	and was one of the last projects Henson would provide creative input on.
72000	77000	The idea for Dinosaurs traces back to a conversation between Jim Henson and Kirk Thatcher in the 1980s.
77000	86000	He had the idea of a family of dinosaurs and that they live very irresponsibly and bigger than life and everything's reckless.
86000	92000	The clumsy dinosaur lumbering through the world is thought to be an evolution of an idea Jim Henson had back in the 1960s,
92000	96000	the Le Choy Dragon, designed for a series of commercials for chow mein.
96000	100000	Although dinosaurs would be a bit more evolved than this ad spot.
102000	106000	Sadly, before the show could begin production in earnest, Jim Henson passed away.
106000	110000	Jim Henson Productions was placed under the care of Jim's son, Brian.
110000	114000	The duty of creating the series fell to Michael Jacobs and Bob Young.
114000	117000	It would be these three men who would bring the show Dinosaurs to life.
117000	122000	Dinosaurs would be one of the most ambitious projects taken on by Jim Henson Productions,
122000	125000	a weekly sitcom using detailed puppets and animatronics,
125000	129000	far more costly than the standard human fountains you would find on television sitcoms.
129000	133000	Much of the technology for the puppets was taken from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie,
133000	137000	which similarly used animatronic heads on top of people wearing suits.
137000	141000	While that was a feature film, a TV sitcom didn't quite have the same budget for effects.
142000	144000	Even a pilot technically would have been too costly.
144000	149000	The only reason this show got off the ground is because ABC initially ordered 13 episodes.
149000	153000	One of the recurring comments I noticed in a lot of people involved in the production was
153000	156000	general amazement that they were able to pull this off.
156000	159000	The concept for the show would be as ambitious as the puppetry.
159000	161000	Brian Henson described it saying,
171000	173000	which was the gem of the idea.
173000	175000	That was my dad's idea before he died.
175000	178000	The dinosaurs were always meant to be a metaphor for human beings,
178000	183000	and the dinosaur aesthetic made it easier to tell stories that would have been tougher with a human cast.
183000	188000	You could attack issues much better when the characters are not quite human.
198000	203000	The underlying intent was to create a series that would provide a satirical look at the modern world,
203000	205000	one that still feels very relevant today.
205000	209000	In an interview with co-creator Michael Jacobs, he describes it saying,
209000	212000	we're trying both to show how humans would have looked to another species
212000	214000	and to make people see themselves in the dinosaurs.
214000	219000	We go around as if we're kings of the earth, but who knows how much time we have left?
219000	222000	A contemporary article from the New York Times described the show as,
222000	224000	the Flintstones meet the Simpsons.
224000	227000	Though neither of those comparisons quite fit.
227000	232000	Although both were primetime animated TV shows and both made commentaries on modern life at the time,
232000	234000	dinosaurs would chart its own path,
234000	238000	telling large stories about the precarious origin of traditions and social norms.
239000	243000	The Sinclair family was headed up by its patriarch, Earl, the mighty Megalosaurus,
243000	247000	as he likes to call himself, much to the eye-rolls of his loved ones.
247000	250000	A not-so-bright middle-aged dinosaur in a dead-end job,
250000	254000	Earl was the classic sitcom lead, a father at the head of his family.
254000	259000	Voiced by Stuart Penkin, Earl was also brought to life by the puppeteers Mac Wilson,
259000	261000	operating the face, and Bill Beretta moving his body.
261000	263000	You're really better off being rid of your family.
263000	264000	Yeah?
264000	267000	Sure, family's one of civilization's worst ideas.
267000	272000	Fran Sinclair is exactly what you'd imagine from the classic TV sitcom, Mom,
272000	274000	complete with the Allosaurus updo.
274000	276000	She keeps the household running as a housewife,
276000	280000	though she does get a chance to break free from the confines of the Sinclair house once in a while.
280000	283000	Alan Troutman moves her face, Tony Savin prints her body,
283000	286000	while her voice is provided by the extremely talented Jessica Walter.
286000	289000	But Tyrannosaurus Rex is king of the dinosaurs.
289000	290000	That's debatable.
290000	293000	No, it's not. I dated one in high school.
294000	300000	Robbie Sinclair, a hypsilifadon, is the often rebellious teenage boy of the family.
300000	305000	Always sporting his Letterman jacket, which is a helpful reminder that he's still in high school,
305000	310000	he still has a sense of optimism about changing the dinosaur society his parents have resigned themselves to.
310000	316000	Steve Whitmire controlled his face, leaf-tilled in his body, and Jason Willinger provided his voice.
316000	320000	If this is the year 60 million in three, why is next year 60 million in two?
320000	322000	Why are we counting backwards? What are we waiting for?
323000	325000	Uh, uh, Fanny?
326000	328000	Maybe you ask too many questions?
328000	329000	Ah.
329000	332000	School is not for asking questions. It's a place you go to be out of this house.
332000	338000	Charlene Sinclair, a protoceratops, is the middle child, aged only 12 at the beginning of the series.
338000	342000	Obviously fashion-forward, Charlene struggles with her blossoming womanhood,
342000	344000	with her signature catchphrase of,
345000	347000	Bruce Lanoyle moved her face,
347000	351000	McLint Sisty her body, and Sally Struthers provided her voice.
374000	377000	The last number of the Sinclair family is its youngest member,
377000	379000	a megalosaurus simply named Baby.
379000	382000	Baby's arms were controlled by Terry Hardin and Julianne Boucher,
382000	386000	but his facial movements and voice are credited to Kevin Clash,
386000	390000	who had plenty of experience with puppetry on his Elmo on Sesame Street.
390000	394000	Undoubtedly the breakout star of the cast, he had a number of popular catchphrases.
398000	402000	The cast was rounded out by a number of occurring characters, such as Earl's boss, B.P. Richfield,
402000	404000	brilliantly voiced by Sherman Hemsley,
404000	406000	Fran's mother Ethel, voiced by Florence Stanley,
406000	409000	Earl's buddy Roy, voiced by Sam McMurray,
409000	411000	Fran's friend Monica, voiced by Susie Plaxson,
411000	415000	and Robbie's friend Spike, voiced by Christopher Maloney.
415000	418000	You probably noticed the diversity in the Sinclair household,
418000	422000	with each family member coming from a different species aside from Earl and Baby,
422000	423000	who were both megalosauruses.
423000	428000	This was done because the idea of the dinosaurs being the same species was thought to be visually boring,
428000	430000	so they were switched up to make them more engaging.
431000	434000	This colorful cast would have some surprisingly thoughtful critiques of modern society,
434000	437000	but it got there on the strength of a frying pan.
441000	443000	The series opens with the episode,
443000	449000	The Mighty Megalosaurus, premiered on April 26, 1991 on ABC.
449000	452000	The first thing we see in the series is a news broadcaster
452000	455000	who later learned is named Howard Henn of Me.
461000	472000	The show was always intended to end with the extinction of the dinosaurs,
472000	474000	and this is a little foreshadowing for us.
474000	477000	The show also frames its premise for us like this.
478000	492000	Expanding on that premise, we see some very modern perspectives on what it means to be a working dinosaur
492000	495000	when Earl asks for a raise from his boss.
507000	526000	In addition to the soul-crushing reality of blue-collar work,
526000	529000	the show also establishes its ecological concerns
529000	533000	by highlighting how Earl's job of tree pusher is impacting the environment.
537000	551000	The big lesson Earl learns in this episode is that,
551000	554000	even if he can't be a big shot out there in the dinosaur world,
554000	556000	he's at least the king of his own home.
567000	570000	This sets up one of the themes I really want to dig into in this series,
570000	574000	and it's how relentlessly it criticizes the idea of unjust hierarchies.
574000	577000	This is echoed in how Earl is subservient to his boss at work,
577000	579000	how Earl keeps his family under his thumb,
579000	583000	and how dinosaur society asserts the environment under its dominance.
583000	588000	The idea that what makes life worthwhile is having someone or something to be superior to
588000	591000	is ultimately self-destructive to dinosaur society.
591000	593000	Something subtly suggested in those opening moments,
593000	596000	and reinforced in the final moments of the episode,
596000	614000	where Earl watches some dumb humans in the yard and has a nice little ironic monologue.
614000	619000	You might be wondering how a show about dinosaur puppets would even get away with tackling such heavy subjects,
619000	624000	but the first episode also includes an answer to that when it introduces us to Baby Sinclair.
624000	637000	Baby's popularity is what gave the show the cover to tell the stories it wanted to.
637000	642000	The series co-creator Michael Jacobs explains how such weighty social commentary made its way into the show.
642000	647000	ABC wanted us to take shots at these subjects because it made a lot of noise and got people talking.
647000	650000	After the initial success of the show, they pretty much left us alone,
650000	652000	especially after the baby became a hit.
652000	656000	As long as the baby hit his father over the head with a pod, we could use that to hide anything.
656000	659000	There are a handful of episodes that exemplify this so well,
659000	661000	opening with a bit of baby-themed slapstick,
661000	666000	and then turning it into a discussion about the power dynamics of religion or corporations.
666000	668000	Which seems as good a place as any to start.
668000	673000	There are many customs which the sacred book of dinosaur commands us to obey.
673000	675000	Traditions are a major part of dinosaur society,
675000	681000	and many of the traditions we see in the show are either from the ancient past or thought up in the present day.
681000	685000	But one consistent aspect to them is how completely arbitrary they are.
685000	689000	For instance, hurling day is a tradition where, on a dinosaur's 72nd birthday,
689000	693000	they get thrown into a tar pit so they don't slow down the other dinosaurs in the pack.
693000	697000	It was randomly thought up one day by an elder many years ago,
697000	702000	and it manifests itself in modern dinosaur society because of this little bit that got thrown in at the end.
711000	722000	Earl and his mother-in-law, Ethel, don't have the best relationship.
732000	736000	This episode lets us look at what really drives traditions, an unthinking obedience,
736000	740000	and in Earl's case, a chance to feel as if he has a high status in society.
742000	753000	The fact that Earl's status and personal joy are derived from this tradition
753000	756000	speaks to how self-interested power perpetuates these traditions.
756000	760000	The show's perspective on traditions is more nuanced, though, than calling them all dumb.
760000	765000	In The Howling, we learn of a tradition where male dinosaurs howl on top of a mountain when they turn 15.
765000	769000	Only Robbie's meek howl is making him feel insecure about it.
771000	782000	Much like Curling Day, The Howling is another sacred tradition, and once again we see Robbie questioning it.
794000	797000	In the previous episode, Robbie was trying to save his grandmother's life,
797000	799000	but in this one, it's his pride on the line.
800000	803000	He spends some time reading the dinosaur's sacred text.
812000	816000	And when Robbie speaks to Earl about what he believes, he starts to understand it a bit more.
829000	840000	Unlike the previous episode, this one seems to uphold traditions as something valuable for the dinosaur society.
840000	844000	But it's not for any mystical reason. It's because of the cultural significance of the ritual.
844000	848000	It highlights the importance of these practices to help seal friendships and community.
848000	852000	They can create friction, as the episode also included a fight between Earl and his buddy Roy,
852000	858000	a fight that was resolved when Robbie helped conduct the ritual and read some passages from the sacred text.
858000	864000	The distinction this show makes about traditions is that while some establish a hierarchy of one dinosaur over another,
864000	868000	such as throwing your mother-in-law into a tar pit, the other builds community,
868000	872000	the howling ceremony that lets friends and family celebrate a rite of passage together.
872000	875000	Although I should mention, only male dinosaurs go through it.
875000	879000	Even though Charlene has a great howl, it's boy dinosaurs who do the howling.
884000	887000	Dinosaur traditions never cleanly map onto human ones.
887000	890000	So all these stories have to be understood as allegories.
890000	897000	And Resistance to traditions and old ways of being are also presented in a handy allegory in the episode titled,
897000	899000	I Never Ate For My Father.
899000	921000	Being a herbivore is a very rich metaphor, most often read as an allegory for Robbie being gay,
921000	926000	but that's selling this episode short, as it's about defiance and independence more broadly.
926000	933000	For example, there's a bit of red scare rhetoric, including an allusion to Joseph McCarthy questioning people about being secret communists.
957000	963000	We also get a nod to drug culture as vegetables being presented as narcotics.
968000	973000	We get a nod to hippie culture with herbivores hanging out in this very hippie-like bar.
980000	983000	The episode is just bursting with allusions to radical politics.
986000	1007000	The episode ends with Earl and Robbie being eaten by a larger creature,
1007000	1012000	and we get a nice little line that sums up the conflict between these two that runs through the entire series.
1016000	1041000	Eventually, Earl and Robbie reach an understanding.
1046000	1072000	Oh, and the creature that ate them coughs them up because their sappy family moment makes him hurl.
1077000	1081000	Traditions, authority, and learning from the past are summed up very nicely in this episode.
1081000	1086000	All the issues alluded to in this episode can be broadly understood as progressive changes to society.
1086000	1091000	Robbie is the youthful voice of change, Earl is the conservative establishment reaction to that change.
1091000	1095000	It takes a lot to convince Earl that he needs to let his son live his own life,
1095000	1099000	but ultimately he remembers that he wants his son to have a better life than he did.
1099000	1102000	Or at the very least, a life his son can call his own.
1102000	1107000	The problem isn't traditions in dinosaur society, but an unthinking obedience to them,
1107000	1112000	being unable to get rid of the harmful ones and resisting improvements to ones that could make the world a better place.
1112000	1115000	Not all traditions are passed down from old stories, though.
1115000	1121000	Some are newly created ones based on the whims of a group of dinosaur elders led by the chief elder.
1121000	1127000	The presentation of this governing body shifts between a cloaked group of mystics to modern day politicians
1127000	1134000	whenever the story seems to need them to, though one constant is that they are the ones in charge of dinosaur society, kind of.
1134000	1139000	One great example of the elders demonstrating their authority is in the episode titled
1139000	1144000	The Greatest Story Ever Told, where they create a religion for dinosaur society.
1144000	1147000	It all begins when a very heavy question is raised.
1157000	1167000	This is the first time anyone has ever asked that question in dinosaur culture, and it spreads through the community like wildfire.
1167000	1172000	With society screeching to a halt, the elders take action and decide to come up with an answer.
1172000	1177000	And since this answer needs to satisfy the dumbest of dinosaurs, Earl is brought in as a judge.
1177000	1184000	There's one dinosaur guru who presents a rather nice-sounding belief system that doesn't get picked up because Earl is underwhelmed by it.
1184000	1195000	For only through good works and sacrifice can we find peace and a sense of purpose, and finally come to know why we've been given this blessed gift of life.
1195000	1197000	That's beautiful.
1197000	1199000	Oh yes, truly a guide to life.
1199000	1201000	Too much work.
1201000	1202000	Doesn't have a hat.
1202000	1203000	Yeah.
1203000	1205000	Here's the answer they landed on.
1205000	1213000	A giant magic flying potato swoops down, makes a few magical gestures, bing bang boom, universe.
1214000	1217000	Are you talking about a baked potato?
1217000	1219000	Look, look, the idiot's buying it.
1219000	1221000	I think we may be on to something here.
1221000	1228000	With an omnipotent potato seated as their new god, some easy answers are offered and society is placated.
1228000	1229000	Mostly.
1229000	1232000	Once again, Robbie has some questions.
1232000	1233000	Good afternoon, citizens.
1233000	1235000	Hail the potato.
1235000	1236000	Hail.
1236000	1237000	Hail.
1237000	1241000	Son, we understand you're finding the transition to potatoism fraught with difficulty.
1242000	1244000	It can be an anxious and puzzling time.
1244000	1246000	We're here to help.
1247000	1253000	Earl is arrested alongside Robbie, and they're soon to be burned at the stake, but a wind arrives and saves their lives.
1253000	1261000	Ah, well, ah, it's, ah, it's not for us to try to understand the mysterious ways of the potato.
1261000	1266000	Ah, for, ah, for its plan is beyond the can of mere mortals.
1266000	1268000	You're making this up!
1268000	1271000	And everyone is offered the freedom to believe whatever they want.
1271000	1278000	We all need answers, but we can't make the mistake of accepting the first answer that's handed to us just because it's there.
1278000	1282000	Everyone must be allowed to believe what they want to believe.
1282000	1290000	Ah, you know, I always sort of believed that the universe was coughed up by the great congested warthog.
1290000	1295000	That's interesting, and you're entitled to that belief.
1295000	1298000	Ganding is actually kind of beautiful.
1298000	1301000	Dad, what do you think the stars caught fire?
1301000	1304000	I've never thought about it before, son.
1304000	1307000	But now I think I will.
1307000	1316000	It really exemplifies how unanswerable questions lead us to answers that aren't necessarily good, but at least satisfy that desire to know.
1316000	1322000	This is one of the most skating anti-religion episodes I've ever seen on a sitcom from the 1990s.
1322000	1332000	It not only presents it all as a farce, but highlights how the elders want to use religion to distract the masses so they don't start asking tough questions, all in an effort to protect the economy.
1332000	1339000	Because of the vexing and unwelcome questions of this small child, the economy is ruined!
1339000	1345000	The government is on the verge of collapse, and chaos reigns in the streets.
1345000	1346000	Say you're sorry.
1346000	1348000	I'm sorry!
1348000	1350000	What? We're outta here!
1350000	1355000	I really can't imagine an episode like this being done with human beings, at least not back in the 1990s.
1355000	1360000	Aside from that one dinosaur, there are no positive representations of religion in this episode.
1360000	1372000	Even with the relatively soft ending, giving some credence to the idea of religious pluralism, this presents a spiritual life as an arbitrary one, more likely used as a tool to control the masses and keep the money flowing.
1373000	1389000	But the political analogy of the elders is really laid bare in the series' only two-parter titled, Nuts to War, where the dinosaur society we're familiar with, made up almost entirely of two-legged dinosaurs, are going to war with an unseen nation of other dinosaurs, who are four-legged.
1389000	1392000	And the reason they're going to war… well, it's this.
1393000	1399000	We interrupt our regular programming to bring you this DNN special report. Pistachios, why aren't there any to be found?
1399000	1411000	This episode is presented with a lot of melodramatic flair, and this is a reference to a miniseries from 1983 titled, The Winds of War, which was about World War II.
1411000	1420000	This two-parter highlights the first ever war for dinosaur society, with war being an acronym presented by the Elder-in-Chief.
1420000	1425000	It's a complex issue, but luckily can be boiled down to a simple slogan.
1431000	1436000	And since this is dinosaurs, it lays on some heavy social commentary.
1451000	1479000	Aside from how politicians use war, another nice touch of this two-parter is how wars commercialize, presented as yet another product to be sold on television.
1479000	1482000	After all, wars are a great way to make some money.
1482000	1511000	This two-parter is so densely packed with commentary it's hard to keep up, from Fran's friend Monica being the target of anti-four-legger bigotry,
1511000	1521000	to Earl finding out his tree-pushing job is being used to make weapons for the war, and saddest of all, we find out after Robbie is sent to war, he comes back a changed dinosaur.
1541000	1563000	That ending went right for the jugular, showing us how Robbie has been changed by the war.
1563000	1572000	Sure, he survived it in one piece, but he's been made more brutal psychologically, and he reflects a society that has been taught to hate a supposed enemy.
1572000	1580000	Warfare is depicted softly in this two-parter, mostly being a case of snarling and spitting, with only a single fatality being reported.
1580000	1583000	But this two-parter speaks more broadly about the horrors of war.
1583000	1591000	Most war media focuses on the violent traumas, and while I certainly wouldn't downplay those, they're only a part of how war can impact a society.
1592000	1603000	War in this show operates on a system that sends dinosaurs off to be killed in the name of profit, while shaping a society to see dinosaurs on the other side as beneath them for looking a little different.
1603000	1618000	Think about what wartime propaganda looked like during World War II, all the racist imagery used to dehumanize those on the other side, and while some of that might reflect prejudices of the day, war seems to give extra permission for some of the ugliest sentiments to come out, and it's not like this kind of thing fades over time.
1618000	1626000	This is presented very handily by dinosaurs later on in an episode titled Green Card, which a bad economy is blamed on four-legged dinosaurs.
1626000	1632000	The two-legged dinosaurs decide to build a wall to keep the four-legged dinosaurs out, which should sound familiar.
1632000	1643000	One thing that's noticeable is how Earl, who's always disliked friend's friend Monica, has gone from hating her for being a strong, independent woman, to hating her because she has four legs.
1648000	1666000	It shows how dislike for a specific dinosaur can be generalized into bigotry to a whole species, and it's not a coincidence that four-legged dinosaurs were once again painted as the problem by the elders, who are, by the way, shown to be once more working at the behest of big businesses.
1666000	1675000	The legacy of wartime lives on, not just as messaging that leaves an impact, but as a tactic used by those with power in society to present a scapegoat for their failures.
1675000	1680000	Doesn't it seem like this running out of trees thing is something a company might have anticipated?
1680000	1683000	Yeah, yeah, you know the company should have planned ahead.
1683000	1685000	Shh!
1685000	1692000	It sounds to me like it's high time that the government stepped in and started to regulate these big companies.
1692000	1703000	Whoa! How dare you blame the company you mewling pack of ingrates! It's not the company's fault! It's never the company's fault! Take a look at this!
1703000	1706000	The Journal of Economic Finger-Pointing.
1706000	1716000	Published quarterly by the government! It clearly states that all our current economic troubles are traceable to one source! Four-leggers!
1718000	1725000	There's a subplot in the nuts-to-war two-parter where the baby fights a small animal called the cookie creature who steals cookies from baby.
1725000	1730000	He's all set to kill it, but he learns empathy for it when he sees that the cookie creature has a family.
1730000	1739000	It's a nice counterpoint to the main story, showing that learning to understand your enemies as living creatures, as worthy of life as you are, instead of trying to destroy them.
1751000	1756000	Sadly, we see little of this in the broader dinosaur world, which shows how broken the society is.
1756000	1762000	One more episode that discusses the impact of traditions I want to talk about is Charlene's Flat World.
1762000	1768000	In it, Charlene is hit with a flash of inspiration and gives a science class presentation about the Earth being round.
1768000	1793000	While this looks like it's going to be another examination of the deep cynicism that pervades this world and series, we instead get something a bit more upbeat.
1793000	1797000	First, Charlene gives a rousing defense of free expression.
1798000	1817000	And then Charlene uses her wits to save her own life.
1829000	1831000	You are hereby condemned to death.
1831000	1835000	Your Honor, may I be allowed to choose the method of execution?
1835000	1839000	Of course. Never forget this is your legal system.
1839000	1854000	It is now time to carry out the sentence of the court. Charlene and Robertson Claire, you are hereby condemned, as was requested, to be put to death by being thrown off the edge of our flat world into the great void beyond.
1855000	1865000	Charlene proves her intelligence, fighting, and winning against the system.
1865000	1875000	In little acts of rebellion like these and the earlier ones with Robbie and Baby, we get a sense that the kids have a shot at making the world a better place, even though at the moment the deck is dramatically stacked against them.
1875000	1886000	Although this note is only lightly hit throughout the series, and sometimes seems like an excuse to tag on happy ending most sitcoms require, it does offer a kind of hope that the series sometimes desperately needs.
1886000	1895000	If the whole run was just a series of episodes about how horrible the world is, and the powers that be are only making it worse, it might be a bit too emotionally taxing.
1896000	1901000	As you might have noticed in some of these clips, certain dinosaur outfits are used multiple times for a variety of characters.
1901000	1915000	Considering the cost of making them, the show couldn't afford unique dinosaurs for each episode, so while the principal cast remains unique, we see a handful of one-off characters using the same outfits over and over, sometimes more than once in the same episode.
1915000	1919000	And as sturdy as these dinosaurs look, they were actually incredibly fragile.
1919000	1927000	Because of the materials that were used, the puppets started falling apart very quickly, and none of them would last more than five or six years, before becoming completely unusable.
1927000	1932000	While the show didn't last that long, it does mean that none of the original puppets have survived.
1932000	1936000	The complexity of these puppets are also why three people were required to bring each dinosaur to life.
1936000	1940000	One person moving the body, the other controlling the head, and one more giving it a voice.
1941000	1949000	It's pretty impressive that each one of these characters was the product of three talented performers working together to create them, and so many more when it came to building and designing them.
1949000	1954000	The cost of this series is supposedly a big reason why it only lasted a mere four seasons.
1954000	1963000	Building new dinosaurs doesn't get much cheaper over time when it's done with such specialized technology, and so many performers meant that many more paychecks had to be signed.
1963000	1968000	Still, the results are impressive and create an effect that still looks great 30 years later.
1970000	1981000	Male and female dinosaurs are constantly trying to figure out how to live with one another in dinosaur society, and it's here the analogies probably hit home the easiest.
1981000	1992000	Outside of the family dynamic, we can see the rules of male and female dinosaurs more clearly, such as the episode where one of the world's coworkers tells a joke about friend's friend Monica, who has only recently become a tree pusher.
1992000	1996000	The friend's name is Al Harris, and his nickname is Sexual.
1996000	2001000	The title of the episode is What Sexual Harris Meant.
2001000	2003000	Not all the jokes can be winners here, folks.
2022000	2036000	Although Monica has no real dream of being a tree pusher, she decides to fight for this job against hostile work conditions as a role model to young dinosaurs like Charlene.
2052000	2066000	A hearing takes place very evocative of the Anita Hill hearings that were in the news the same year this episode aired.
2066000	2078000	Those hearings having been a major event when it comes to workplace sexual harassment as Anita Hill was testifying against Clarence Thomas, a current justice on the Supreme Court for sexually harassing her.
2078000	2082000	In the dinosaurs hearing, Al is pretty open about what he did.
2108000	2121000	While Monica gets a nice tail whip as payback, it's not quite the same as being able to work without being sexually harassed.
2121000	2132000	And even though Charlene is inspired to demand better for herself, the show ends on a bitter note.
2132000	2157000	In another episode, Fran Live, Fran gets a job hosting a TV advice show. Her advice is pretty solid.
2157000	2185000	But this show has unintended consequences, such as wives getting ideas about jobs.
2185000	2212000	Especially Fran quits the show, but also gives up just being a housewife.
2212000	2221000	The episodes about feminism and women finding a place in the workforce are a strange mix of being relevant to the modern day, while also feeling incredibly dated.
2221000	2229000	The type of sexual harassment Monica faced, while not so comically overt and obvious in the real world, still has a ring of truth in light of the recent Me Too movement.
2229000	2236000	On the other hand, Fran having to fight to get a job speaks to an earlier time when families could survive on a single working class income.
2236000	2242000	These days, a dual income household seems more like a necessity than a strike against the patriarchy.
2242000	2250000	In Honey I Miss the Kids, Fran decides to start working, leaving Earl to pick up some slack at home, changing his shifts at work so he can be at home with the kids during the day.
2250000	2256000	An unhappy Earl decides to be a super dad to make his wife jealous, so she'll give up the job to return back home.
2256000	2258000	Plan backfires twice.
2258000	2264000	First, Fran likes seeing Earl do more parenting, and second, Earl finds out he actually enjoys it too.
2264000	2273000	And when Fran cuts back on her hours so Earl doesn't spend so much time at home, it's bittersweet watching him leave his family to return to his usual work schedule.
2288000	2312000	This show, for all its cynicism about the world, could be surprisingly touching when it wanted to, and episodes like this one felt essential when watching the series as a whole.
2312000	2328000	They're a gentle reminder of how family life can be a real challenge, but the rewards are very real, and that the people within a family are the ones that are in the best position to decide what they look like, not archaic gender roles that tell a father his place in society is at work away from his children.
2328000	2338000	One example of the show being ahead of the curve compared to sitcoms of the day was its take on the very special episode about drugs, in the episode titled, A New Leaf.
2338000	2345000	The episode unfolds mostly the way it would on other shows with Robbie being corrupted by a kid at school and wasting his time getting high.
2345000	2351000	It gets a little different by the end where the entire family starts eating this mysterious plant and their lives fall apart.
2351000	2378000	On the whole, the episode is formulaic and a bit boring, but it manages to completely shine through its brilliance in the final moments.
2379000	2391000	This episode serves as a nice reminder that these kinds of very special episodes have become completely formulaic and stale, and if a message is so important, wrapping it up in something so uninteresting will only hurt it.
2391000	2404000	Ironically, that makes this anti-drug message far more memorable than the ones that came after the end of all those other sitcoms where the cast earnestly speaks to the audience at the end. Comedy is just more convincing than sincerity sometimes.
2409000	2419000	Personification is persistent throughout the series. The only creatures that don't act like people, ironically, are the humans. They're presented as voiceless animals, making noises, and usually not a whole lot more than that.
2423000	2433000	There is one exception to the grunting animals pattern, though, and that's in the episode titled, The Discovery, where Earl goes golfing, stumbles through some bushes, and binds an entire, undiscovered continent.
2439000	2442000	In truly human fashion, Earl does a bit of colonialism.
2443000	2447000	I hereby claim this land in the name of Earl Sneed Sinclair.
2462000	2468000	Earl brands the cave people as savages, and teams up with the We Say So Corporation to, uh, wow.
2472000	2494000	Earl is no Columbus, though, and upon learning that these people have a rich culture of their own, which he learns from a dinosaur interpreter, he gives up the claim to the land. Earl also doesn't want to pay 11 million dollars in taxes.
2502000	2523000	I guess this belongs to you.
2524000	2529000	We remember Earl.
2531000	2534000	And then the government tricks the humans and takes their land.
2554000	2576000	The episode has a few awkward elements, if it's going to be an analogy to colonialism, though. Importantly, in the real world, indigenous people and colonizers are all human beings, unlike dinosaurs and humans, which aren't close to the same species at all, and one is clearly more advanced than the other.
2577000	2587000	It could be read as offensive, but I'm not sure it's coherent enough for that. What weighs more on my mind is that this idea for this episode just wasn't considered in the overall context of the series.
2588000	2600000	As I mentioned earlier, the humans were generally portrayed on the show as empty-headed brutes. If they're capable of building a society, is it really okay for Charlene in another episode to take in some human children to perform in a circus act?
2600000	2612000	Humans are given special treatment on the show by virtue of missing the human characteristics the dinosaurs have. So the colonialism analogy is an irony that doesn't quite work since the two sides, aside from this one episode, have no real overlap.
2613000	2618000	In the real world, colonialism was preceded by two cultures from the same species coming into contact.
2619000	2631000	In dinosaurs, colonialism is preceded by two distinct species with their own unique cultures coming into contact. Only humans are well known to dinosaurs at this point, and within dinosaur society, are more or less just animals.
2632000	2641000	If this were really translated in the real world, it would be like finding a civilization entirely populated by dogs. Would that still be colonialism? I'm not so sure.
2641000	2652000	So while I'm amazed that a 90s sitcom decided to do an episode about colonialism at all, it doesn't quite come together as well as it could have if the victims had been, perhaps, other dinosaurs.
2653000	2669000	Another interesting use of humans is how the series frames its clip shows. A staple of sitcoms from years past, these collections of moments from previous episodes usually force the cast into a confined space where they reminisce about older episodes offering the chance to play highlights of classic moments.
2669000	2677000	In dinosaurs, we see an archaeologist named Sir David Tushingham describe the majesty of the dinosaurs, setting up clips in a fun way.
2677000	2686000	As we try to debunk the myths, strip away the illusions, and lipo suck the fatty misconceptions from the thighs of history.
2687000	2700000	Humans were also the subject of the only spin-off the series had, a series titled First Family, also known as The Oog Show, about a caveman family. A pilot was produced, but it never got further than that.
2700000	2711000	The presence of humans in the series is tertiary to how the series presents its main themes. Regardless of any humans in the series, it's the dinosaurs we care about, and that's one of the great ironies of the show. We're the same as the dinosaurs.
2712000	2720000	One day in the future, humans will go extinct too, but we laugh at the dinosaurs as if they aren't us. But the only things that make them funny or relatable are the things that we can see in ourselves.
2721000	2732000	You probably couldn't make a sitcom about dinosaurs running around eating plants or each other. You need to make them human-like so we can understand them. And once you make them like us, you create a weird space that makes certain criticisms about human society more palatable.
2733000	2741000	Part of our minds are allowed the freedom to pretend that they're somehow inherently different, which also allows commentary that might seem more awkward or challenging, easier to digest.
2741000	2758000	What makes dinosaurs different, like all the threats of physical violence, are a fun distraction but ultimately aren't what we care about as the audience. That's just stage dressing. The human stories are what resonates with us, and the series delves deep into the challenges of modern society in ways unusual for a sitcom at the time.
2758000	2782000	Dinosaurs provided a lot of commentary on the absurdities of surviving in the modern world, an exploitative nature of the class system, and it managed to do this without turning into a lecture about socialism. Although it had one of those in an episode too.
2788000	2813000	Okay, that's enough of that. Earl works for the charmingly named We Say So Corporation, embodied by his cantankerous boss BP Richfield. But before discussing this, I just want to point out how Sherman Hemsley absolutely nails the character of BP Richfield.
2818000	2847000	In sitcoms, particularly older ones, bosses are presented as scary or insincere friends. The subtext is that these are people who can ruin your life.
2847000	2874000	In Richfield's case, he's also a boss that might eat you. If the initials BP remind you of an oil spill in 2010, that's not a coincidence. The names Sinclair, BP, Richfield, and Hess were chosen because they belong to fossil fuel companies. It's a small joke, dinosaurs are literally fossils, that takes on a greater meaning when you consider that dinosaurs are ultimately responsible for the end of their civilization, much like fossil fuels could help end ours.
2874000	2901000	The influence of corporations can be felt throughout the series, not just in the lives of the dinosaurs who cower beneath them, but the environment itself is often at their mercy.
2901000	2917000	A response to the environmental neglect of the We Say So Corporation comes from nature when it describes how life is all connected through the environment in the episode, If I Were a Tree, where Ethel is reading a story to the baby about a dinosaur, much like Earl, that's turned into a tree.
2931000	2949000	And the tree lives inside of Earl.
2949000	2971000	In both cases, dinosaurs learn more about nature and all it can offer them. The tree ends up sacrificing itself to save Earl.
2971000	2999000	Earl is too clueless to realize what's wrong and while this might not be satisfying from a certain perspective, the show helpfully shows us a more useful way of reading it.
2999000	3021000	I honestly wish this way of reading media were more common. While following a character on their journey can feel rewarding, sometimes it's important to learn the lessons the characters don't, and it's especially important to show such as dinosaurs, where there are some lessons characters will never really learn, or will only learn too late.
3022000	3043000	The episode opens up with news of the Bunch Beetles returning on their annual migration, where they eat the cider poppies that grow up across Pangea and mate to create a new generation of Bunch Beetles, only this time they don't show up.
3044000	3067000	The Sinclair family happens to meet the last Bunch Beetle, who reveals that the swamp that was their mating ground is now a factory, making the very symbolic product of wax fruit.
3067000	3090000	We say so, Corporation is behind this factory and the source of this problem. Earl puts his faith in technology being able to turn things around, though the solution is to spray pesticides all over the entire planet, which ends up killing all the plants. Earl, still ever faithful to his employer, is convinced they'll figure out a solution to this one.
3097000	3108000	The We Say So Corporation comes to the conclusion that rain will help the plants grow, and Richfield reveals their plan to create some clouds that would hopefully rain over the world.
3127000	3149000	As you might have guessed, this doesn't work. Clouds block out the sun, causing temperatures to drop. It's predicted the sun won't shine for tens of thousands of years. Here's Richfield's response.
3157000	3182000	And Earl is left to learn a painful lesson.
3187000	3212000	We understand, sweetheart. Understand what?
3217000	3245000	And the last we see of the Sinclair family is Earl looking out into the world with waning hope as the ashes fall around him.
3247000	3275000	After all, dinosaurs have been on this earth for 150 million years. And it's not like we're going to just disappear.
3275000	3295000	The final lines come from Howard Hand Up Me.
3295000	3308000	This is one of those episodes that speaks so clearly for itself that there isn't much commentary I need to add to it. It's a perfectly fitting end to the series, wrapping up its story and issuing a warning to the people watching at home. We only get one planet, and we have to take care of it.
3308000	3318000	In the world of TV finales, this one is often brought up as one of the saddest. And while killing off your entire cast is always going to be a low note, the fact that it was a sitcom made this hit even harder.
3318000	3331000	Comedies, traditionally and happily. And sitcoms usually live up to that tradition with their characters getting married, moving out, or in some fashion, moving on to the next exciting chapter in their lives. They don't usually die in a planet-wide extinction event.
3332000	3342000	An interesting fact about the production of this episode is that it wasn't intended to be the finale. According to the episode's writer, Kirk Thatcher, it was only turned into a finale when they learned the fourth season would be the show's last.
3342000	3354000	It was kind of the premise of the show, is that this was what happens when you think you own the world and do whatever you want and change the ecosystem to fit your idea of what's right for you as opposed to what's right for everything else on the planet.
3355000	3357000	Series co-creator Michael Jacobs expanded on that saying,
3358000	3385000	There was some pushback from ABC regarding the final episode. Michael Jacobs describes a call he got from ABC's president at the time, Ted Harbert.
3385000	3386000	He said,
3386000	3390000	Where do you even come up with the idea that you can destroy the entire cast in the last episode?
3390000	3391000	I said,
3391000	3402000	Well, Ted, it's not the cast that we were trying to destroy. It's the entire world. My source for doing this is history. He thought about it for about 30 seconds on the phone in silence and said,
3402000	3403000	Okay.
3403000	3409000	When you do a show about dinosaurs, you always have that extinction card in your pocket, and we wanted to use it.
3410000	3418000	Changing nature wasn't technically the last episode of the series to air. There were seven more episodes that were produced but not broadcast during its final fourth season.
3418000	3429000	They would be aired sometime later during syndication. So the last original episode of Dinosaurs to Air was an episode where Earl fights a children's entertainer, not unlike Barney the Dinosaur.
3429000	3433000	You wouldn't put out the most beloved character on children's TV.
3433000	3434000	Huh?
3435000	3437000	This is for all you parents at home.
3440000	3448000	Even so, Changing Nature is still widely regarded as the series finale. It aired on July 20th, 1994.
3453000	3461000	Dinosaurs had a short run, but it certainly had an impact. It debuted as part of ABC's TGIF lineup between Full House and Family Matters.
3461000	3466000	Although ratings were initially strong, they suffered after we moved several times on the network schedule.
3466000	3469000	It couldn't match its earlier success, and it was eventually cancelled.
3469000	3476000	During its heyday, there was a decent amount of merchandise made of it, such as toys, dolls, and other products that could be purchased.
3476000	3481000	One of the funner ideas was an album called Big Songs, in which characters from the show would perform.
3481000	3487000	Its lead single, I'm the Baby, had a music video produced, and it was aired as part of one of these season three episodes.
3487000	3492000	Another fun fact about this song is that the lyrics were written by Stuart Pankin, the voice of Earl Sinclair.
3492000	3500000	Listening to the album, most of the songs aren't terribly memorable outside of the lead single, and a surprisingly good track from BP Richfield called Cold-Blooded Guy.
3500000	3502000	You can find the music on YouTube if you're curious.
3502000	3511000	The album, while unusual for a sitcom, wasn't unusual for a show that was constantly compared to The Simpsons, with The Simpsons having several albums produced with music sung by the cast.
3511000	3516000	The Simpsons itself even noted similarities to Dinosaurs in one episode from 1992.
3517000	3519000	Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!
3519000	3522000	Look, Maggie, they have a baby too!
3522000	3525000	It's like they saw our lives and put it right up on screen.
3525000	3528000	And Dinosaurs had some fun pushing back against the comparison.
3528000	3535000	This is why TV stinks. One show's a hit. They make 50 more like it with the same characters and the same premise.
3535000	3538000	Don't have a cow, man!
3539000	3550000	Although Dinosaurs' staff would note that Jim Henson had the idea for the show back in 1988, while before The Simpsons debuted as a half-hour sitcom, it should be noted that The Simpsons actually debuted in 1987 on the Tracy Allman Show.
3550000	3562000	There's no reason to think Jim Henson was inspired by these shorts, and ultimately I'm not sure it matters who came up with a satirical look at sitcom families and contemporary American culture through the lens of entertainment typically presented for children.
3562000	3565000	Both shows have their respective strengths, and are worthy of watching.
3565000	3569000	Although one went out on a high note, and the other is still around.
3569000	3578000	Another at-comparison to Dinosaurs is also a precursor to The Simpsons, and that's The Flintstones, the first massively successful animated TV sitcom on a major network.
3578000	3582000	Although airing in the 1960s, it never had the edge of The Simpsons or Dinosaurs.
3582000	3592000	Funnily enough, there was a Flintstones comic published by DC Comics in 2016 that explored issues of capitalism, genocide, and other fun topics you might sooner expect from an episode of Dinosaurs.
3592000	3604000	There's no direct link between these two pieces of media, but the prehistoric setting, biting social commentary, and subversion of a kid-friendly aesthetic suggests some kind of connection between the two.
3604000	3613000	Upon the completion of Dinosaurs, many of the puppeteers continued to be part of the Jim Henson Company for decades, with some going on to work on Sesame Street, The Muppets, and other Jim Henson productions.
3613000	3623000	Stuart Penkin, the voice of Earl Sinclair, would go on to make guest appearances on a number of television shows, such as Malcolm in the Middle and Curb Your Enthusiasm, though he may still be best remembered as the voice of Earl.
3623000	3634000	Jessica Walter, the voice of Fran, was a prolific actress all her life, and following Dinosaurs, she would go on to appear in several big roles, such as Lucille Bluth on Arrested Development and Mallory Archer on Archer.
3635000	3643000	Sadly, she passed away in 2021 at the age of 80, and the world of entertainment is much sadder having lost her incredible talent.
3643000	3653000	Jason Willinger, the voice of Robbie, has done little acting following Dinosaurs, having shifted his focus to becoming an announcer, doing voice-over work for movie trailers and TV spots.
3653000	3667000	Sally Struthers, the voice of Charlene, is still probably best remembered for being Gloria in All in the Family, though she's been working regularly ever since, including after the end of Dinosaurs, notably having a recurring role on the series Gilmore Girls as Babette Dell.
3667000	3679000	Kevin Clash remained a part of Sesame Street, playing a signature role of Elmo, but he resigned from that position in 2012 after allegations of improper sexual conduct with teenage members of the production while working on the show.
3679000	3689000	These cases were eventually dismissed since they passed the statute of limitations, and Clash recently worked on the Dark Crystal Age of Resistance series for Netflix.
3689000	3698000	As for a Dinosaurs sequel or reboot, there aren't any plans at the moment, though Michael Jacobs has described some discussions he's had with Brian Henson about a sequel.
3698000	3706000	I think we would probably have to start out pretty light and funny before going into a darker territory, but it's a very different world, it's freezing out there.
3706000	3711000	And if they went down the road of a reboot, a 2021 version would look a little different.
3711000	3715000	It'd be very topical, and we'd talk a lot more about global warming and the environment.
3715000	3719000	Robbie and Charlene would be activists and would attack their father for what he does for a living.
3719000	3722000	I think the dinner table conversations would be spectacular.
3722000	3725000	I think Dinosaurs could continue and not miss a step.
3725000	3728000	Brian Henson echoes this sentiment when he looks back on the show.
3729000	3736000	We were ahead of our time, I guess, but we were pulling a lot of our themes from All in the Family, which was years and years before us, and even the honeymooners before that.
3736000	3738000	Yes, we were ahead of our time.
3738000	3744000	But isn't it sad that we were having the same issues, not only decade after decade, but generation after generation?
3744000	3746000	It's sad.
3746000	3753000	Although no plans have been made to bring back the series, it recently made its debut on Disney+, where it may be finding a whole new audience.
3753000	3757000	For a show set millions of years in the past, Dinosaurs was ironically ahead of its time.
3757000	3765000	By using puppets, it was able to delve into topics not often broached on network sitcoms, and its use of practical effects has held up remarkably well.
3765000	3771000	Although some of the references were of its day, the core of the show is still very relevant to a present-day audience.
3771000	3777000	It's not that the show was predicting the future, but rather, it cut to the core of problems deeply ingrained in modern culture.
3777000	3781000	Problems so deep that we shouldn't be surprised that 30 years later, they still persist.
3781000	3787000	If there's one glaring flaw with Dinosaurs, it seems to suggest a submission to these problems through its cynicism.
3787000	3791000	What victories the Sinclair family had always felt rushed and almost magical in their appearance.
3791000	3793000	The happy ending sitcoms tended to demand.
3793000	3798000	At its best, the show dropped the facade of a happy ending and embraced its own cynicism.
3798000	3803000	While I don't think that's the best message in terms of making the world a better place, it does serve as a cautionary tale.
3803000	3808000	While human beings may be no better than the Dinosaurs, that doesn't mean we have to stay that way.
3808000	3816000	And with some reflection, a show like this can go from a misery machine to a lesson on how to make the world a better place by not following the examples of the Dinosaurs.
3816000	3826000	Much like the closing moments of the episode If I Were a Tree, it's not the lessons the characters are unable to learn that are the point of the series, it's the lessons we learn by watching them fail.
3826000	3831000	Ultimately, I think that's what makes the show work so well, because we, as viewers, aren't offered a solution.
3831000	3836000	We have to learn to make the world a better one on our own. Otherwise, we'll just go extinct.
3839000	3844000	I was a little surprised to see Dinosaurs win the poll when I asked people which show they wanted me to cover next.
3844000	3850000	It seemed like such a niche product of its time that I wouldn't expect many people to remember it or want to see more about it.
3850000	3853000	Revisiting the series, I can see why it made such an impact.
3853000	3857000	I thought four seasons, about 70 episodes, I'll be able to get through this quickly.
3857000	3865000	Turns out not so much, it's a very deep show with a lot of interesting themes and ideas, and it felt rewarding to dig a little deeper into them.
3865000	3868000	And I hope people enjoyed this look at Dinosaurs.
3868000	3874000	If you really enjoyed it, you can be much like the names coming up the screen and become a patron or member of this channel.
