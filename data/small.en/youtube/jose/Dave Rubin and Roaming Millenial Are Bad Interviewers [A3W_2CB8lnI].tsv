0	20000	Recently, Anna Kasparian of the Young Turks broke her silence about former co-worker Dave Ruben and spoke at a pair of scathing videos where she not only roasted Dave Ruben to a crisp for his bad interview style and lack of intellectual stature, but she also trashed his more ridiculous libertarian ideas, like getting rid of building regulations.
20000	28000	Roman Millennial took exception to Kasparian's commentary and shot back with her own response video, indignant on Ruben's bath.
28000	34000	Roman presents a lengthy description of hers and, similarly Ruben's, interview style as...
51000	66000	You see, I, like Dave, appreciate interviews where I get to learn more about the person being interviewed. Hopefully that includes questions they've never been asked before, questions that will help the audience learn something new about them and better understand their worldview, right?
66000	75000	Because I feel like if I'm interviewing someone or if I'm watching an interview someone's given, whether I agree with them or not, I want to hear their perspectives, not the interviewers.
75000	83000	And that's not to say that I don't like discussions or debates, formats where there's more of a give and take between both sides, that can be useful too, of course.
83000	90000	But at the end of the day, if you do just want to understand someone, then, yeah, listening to them is really the best way to go about it.
90000	96000	So let's be upfront and clear about one thing. Ruben is very bad at interviewing.
96000	111000	While there's some definite pluses to letting an interview subject express themselves, there's a real problem when an interviewer comes into a lengthy interview having done so little homework that they let their subject dance around talking points that cover up a hidden agenda.
111000	120000	When this happens, you go from being an interviewer who sheds light onto a subject to one who is complicit in helping obfuscate it.
121000	132000	Using the example of Milo Yiannopoulos given by Kasparian, she quite rightly highlights how Ruben offers no resistance to Yiannopoulos's usage of tired, race-realist talking points.
132000	141000	When someone starts talking about IQ and race or religion, that should be a signal to an interviewer that this person may have a hidden agenda.
141000	149000	These are the talking points often used by racists to present their essentialist ideas of race as a pseudoscientific basis for discrimination.
149000	159000	The fact that Ruben was completely unaware of this, and worse, had no idea that this is the sort of garbage Yiannopoulos petals, is especially embarrassing.
159000	161000	His strategy of,
161000	163000	I don't even know where to start with that, so just go.
163000	166000	Oh, but, Romy noticed that.
166000	168000	Is shameful.
168000	175000	Any half-decent interviewer should have had at least some follow-up questions to these supposed scientific facts.
175000	177000	I'll have some examples of those later on.
177000	181000	But wait, this wasn't even the entirety of the point Kasparian was making.
181000	185000	There's a much more serious charge of Ruben not fact-checking.
185000	194000	Whoa, Anna didn't say she's against interviewing certain figures, only that people have a responsibility to correct factual errors when they are presented by people on their platform.
194000	197000	That's not being anti-interview, right?
197000	201000	Well, assured that may be what Anna said, but is that what she meant?
201000	205000	Based on this next clip, it seems like no, it's really not.
205000	207000	Wow, what a dodge.
207000	213000	But Romy had a reason to dodge that, and it has to do with this clip of Kasparian venting about Ruben.
213000	219000	But the reason why I have such a huge problem with Dave Ruben is because he's had Milo Yiannopoulos on his show twice.
219000	221000	Hour-long interviews.
221000	228000	And Milo was able to say whatever he wanted to say without any pushback from Dave Ruben, including anti-Semitic remarks.
228000	237000	So I covered this a few moments ago, but did Kasparian bring this out as evidence of her accusation that Ruben lets people tell lies in his interviews?
237000	245000	Aside from the deceptive nature of Yiannopoulos' comments, this clip is actually in the context of a larger story where the Ruben outburst came from.
245000	252000	If you bother to watch the first few minutes of the video, you'll see Kasparian's comments come in the context of a story about Yiannopoulos,
252000	258000	where he had commented to a journalist, rather blithely, about journalists being murdered in the streets.
258000	271000	The TYT hosts go on to rightly describe the game Yiannopoulos plays, posing as a legitimately concerned voice from the mainstream right while surreptitiously fueling a more extreme position with his subversive talking points,
271000	276000	such as sneaking race realism, aka racism, into his interviews.
276000	284000	This is the context in which Ruben is being criticized for platforming someone and being completely unprepared to counter their noxious talking points.
284000	287000	This is what makes him a bad interviewer.
287000	291000	But to look at things more closely, here's how Romain presented the clip.
302000	304000	Dave Ruben sells it as,
314000	316000	And here's the original video.
331000	341000	What you agree with me on feminism, it's not sexist to point out statistics, I'm suggesting to you, it's not anti-semitic to point out that these things are true now.
341000	343000	The anti-semitism on the Internet.
343000	348000	Okay, that's not remotely true, that's not a stat, that's not a fact.
348000	358000	And if you want to see how someone challenges that deeply anti-semitic trope, watch my interview with David Duke, where I shred him.
358000	362000	And every time he mentions a Jewish banker, I mention a non-Jewish banker, why?
362000	364000	Because I actually bother to do my homework.
364000	373000	And I know that David Duke is a monster, and that if you're going to have a discussion with him, you have to actually rebut what he says, and you have to come with actual facts.
373000	376000	And what does Dave Ruben do?
376000	379000	I don't know what to say about that, just go.
379000	381000	No, no, it's actually worse than that.
381000	389000	Dave Ruben sells it as, I'm far more intellectual, and as a result, I refuse to engage in a debate or an argument.
389000	391000	I allow people to make their case on my show.
391000	393000	No, you're lazy.
393000	395000	Oh, would you look at that?
395000	402000	There was a whole section from Cenk Uygur about how Yiannopoulos didn't cite any real statistics to back up his supposed fact.
402000	405000	I wonder why Roman didn't want to address this point.
405000	413000	Asking your interview subject for a source for their information is, quite possibly, one of the most basic questions an interviewer can ask.
413000	420000	If you're interviewing someone and they say something like, I have a purple elephant that lives in my attic, wouldn't you ask for some evidence of that?
420000	434000	But if someone is talking about the Jews, and how they have disproportionate power and influence, suddenly a follow-up question for evidence is somehow construed as trying to virtue signal or trap someone to a progressive narrative.
434000	440000	It's almost as if there are some inherent assumptions about the Jewish people that Roman is bringing to her analysis.
440000	454000	It's not even necessarily that Roman is a believer in the whole nonsensical Jewish dominance conspiracy, but by not observing that this is something that's trying to be smuggled into the discourse, she's certainly an enabler.
455000	464000	Roman continues on a lengthy diatribe proving how she doesn't understand at all the idea of using statistics as a backtor for sneaking in bigotry.
464000	466000	Here's a simple example to make the point more salient.
466000	470000	In the 16th century, the literacy rates of England were abysmal.
470000	474000	This graph here represents just how many people were illiterate in England.
474000	483000	90% of men and 100% of women using the logic of a race realist, or in this case perhaps a literacy realist.
483000	496000	A dry reading of the stats would lead you to believe that the vast majority of human beings are not capable of being literate, and women in particular are not as literate as men, perhaps not capable of literacy at all.
496000	504000	But if we follow this graph through the centuries, we see the literacy rates not only plummet, but men and women reach a parity at the beginning of the 20th century.
504000	514000	It doesn't take any real brain power to figure out that access to education dramatically increased literacy rates among the population, and changing attitudes towards women gave them greater access to education.
514000	521000	But what about the proposition by the literacy realist, that human beings generally can't be literate, and that women are worse than men?
521000	528000	Time has revealed that person to be, at best, uninformed, and at worse, a bigot, in disguise.
528000	537000	That's the problem with someone with an agenda citing neutral statistics, and why it's important to be vigilant against anyone who tries to sneak this sort of toxic thinking into discourse.
537000	542000	It's also something that Rubin, and Roman, fail at spectacularly.
543000	551000	Roman goes from defending Rubin to defending the alt-right, and Yiannopoulos, in a strange way, claiming that back in those naive days of 2016.
551000	560000	Back then, the alt-right as a term and movement was much more ambiguous than it is currently, and people, including Milo, were using it to mean what's referred to now as the new right.
560000	564000	The alt-right wasn't inherently and always about white nationalism like it is now.
565000	576000	Of course, when Yiannopoulos wrote a big article that served as a guide to the alt-right, he consulted with actual white nationalists to get the message out, as revealed in this report by BuzzFeed News.
576000	581000	So yeah, Roman, it was always there, and Yiannopoulos helped put it there.
581000	586000	If you follow the Rubin report at all, you'll know that Dave actually gets a variety of guests on.
586000	590000	Left-wingers, right-wingers, atheists, Christians, Muslims, ex-Muslims.
590000	597000	In fact, the only thing most of the people on his show have in common is that they're free speech supporters most of the time.
597000	599000	This is rich.
599000	606000	Rubin rarely ever has a left-wing guest on, and when he does, he brings them on to bash the left.
606000	614000	In fact, this left-bashing, more than free expression, is what animates Rubin's guest list, and his audience too, by the way.
614000	620000	His entire show is fueled by anti-left hatred, and what that does is move its audience to the right.
620000	627000	I went into great detail on how this works in another video of mine, which is worth a watch if you have 40 minutes to spare.
627000	633000	You can also see this in the topics Rubin covers, as he's on top of any confrontation on a university campus.
633000	637000	But he's silent when it comes to the President of the United States attacking the press.
637000	643000	Next, Roman claims Kasparian is attacking Rubin as a person, and not going after his ideas.
643000	652000	What really bothers me in political discourse is when people choose to attack you personally instead of going after your ideas, your policies, your content, whatever it may be.
652000	656000	And based on these videos, that seems to be exactly what Anna's MO is.
656000	658000	Of course, she later goes on to say.
658000	664000	Now, after that clip in the video, Anna does go into some substantive criticisms about Day's positions as a libertarian,
664000	669000	and she uses examples of him talking about the post office and building regulations specifically.
669000	671000	I'm not going to go into that.
671000	673000	So I guess we're getting a bit of both here.
673000	677000	Maybe Roman is so upset about the personal attacks, her language got muddled.
677000	682000	Anyway, let's look at some of these personal attacks as highlighted by Roman.
682000	691000	He has partnered with Learn Liberty, which is funded by the Koch brothers, in addition to Prager University, and boom, he's suddenly a libertarian thinker.
691000	701000	My accusations about him being lazy are evident in his lack of intellectual curiosity, which translates to a level of ignorance on a wide variety of issues.
701000	708000	This isn't just an ad hominem, as Kasparian clearly explains her motivations in doing this when she says.
708000	717000	Consider the fact that Dave Rubin is a public figure who represents you, and he doesn't actually genuinely believe in your ideology.
717000	723000	What Kasparian is saying is that Rubin's views are disingenuous, and that his change of heart is driven by money,
723000	728000	and this explains his lazy interview style and shameless platforming of libertarian voices.
728000	737000	If I were interviewing Roman Millennial, I'd probably ask a follow-up question right here about her claim that Kasparian is using an ad hominid.
738000	750000	Roman, if you're claiming Anna Kasparian is using a cheap personal attack by saying Dave Rubin doesn't mean what he says, aren't you guilty of the same thing in this very video when you say this?
750000	759000	Well, I'm sure that may be what Anna said, but is that what she meant? Based on this next clip, it seems like no, it's really not.
759000	764000	And as another follow-up question, Roman, why are you so bad at this?
764000	772000	But let's forget this terrible video and instead focus on one last point I'd like to raise, and I think it will shock everyone watching.
772000	776000	I think Anna Kasparian got it wrong here on her point about the Koch funding.
776000	790000	To clarify, the Koch brothers, or Charles Koch specifically via Learn Liberty, are absolutely influencing the Rubin report by supplying Rubin with libertarian guests because, as Kasparian has helpfully pointed out,
790000	793000	He was lazy when he worked here. He's lazy now.
793000	799000	The money Rubin likely gets from them probably doesn't hurt either. But here's the important distinction we need to make.
799000	811000	Rubin's partnership with Learn Liberty began in September of 2016, whereas Rubin's show, in its bobble-headed nodding-along glory, began in September of 2015.
811000	818000	It's a full year of shows Rubin produced before getting that Koch brother funding, and yes, that included an interview.
819000	826000	That said, I don't doubt for a second that the Learn Liberty group knew exactly what they were buying into.
826000	834000	Space on the platform from a very useful guy who, according to his former coworker, isn't that bright or hardworking.
834000	841000	There's one additional factor that I think is the missing piece in this puzzle though, and where I disagree with Kasparian on the issue.
841000	845000	I think Rubin is very easily manipulated.
845000	853000	He's so easily manipulated that he's nothing more than an overseer for a show that's just a convenient platform for anti-left sentiment.
853000	862000	I believe Rubin is genuine when he states his beliefs because he's not smart enough to see through how ridiculous the libertarian ideas he espouses are,
862000	870000	and throughout that first year of his show you can see him slowly but surely being manipulated into those positions by his guests and audience alike.
870000	872000	Here's a before and after clip.
900000	924000	Did Rubin change his opinion for the money, or was he duped by clever people than him to change his mind?
925000	928000	My guess is it's the latter.
928000	937000	To be fair, it could be a bit of both, but I found the axiom of not blaming on malevolence what you can on stupidity very useful over the years.
937000	941000	And how can we not see stupidity when we look at Dave Rubin?
