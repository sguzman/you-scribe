400	6080	Conservative comedy is having a weird moment. Right now it has a strange dynamic where it only
6080	10880	makes sense in the context of two competing audiences. One, a left-wing audience that is
10880	15200	supposedly offended or outraged at everything, and the conservative audience laughing at that
15200	20480	outrage. Many conservative comedians play to this dynamic not by telling good or even legible jokes,
20480	24800	but instead emphasizing how much they're bothering the other side. For an example of this,
24800	31680	let's look at James Delingpole's 2011 book, 365 Ways to Drive a Liberal Crazy. The introduction
31680	36080	opens with as good a primer as I've seen. Liberals are easy meat for conservatives for
36080	41920	several good reasons. One, liberals have no sense of humor. Two, liberals have no facts on their
41920	48720	side. Three, liberals are hypocrites. Four, God, being conservative himself, hates liberalism at
48720	53840	least as much as you do, which is why he created reasons one, two, and three. And here's one of
53840	61040	the jokes. Always refer in pitting, sympathetic tones to the liberal psychopathology. This
61040	67040	implies that liberalism is a form of mental illness, which it is. That's a joke that got
67040	72960	published in a book. Personally, it didn't drive me crazy. Maybe that's because I'm not a liberal,
72960	77680	but I'm not sure it would drive a liberal crazy either. It's such a weak milquetoast jab that I
77680	82480	can't imagine anyone really being bothered by this. Maybe the joke where liberals are called
82480	87600	Nazis would bother someone, but it's so wordy and clumsy it doesn't really hit. That's one of
87600	92560	the weirdest parts about conservative humor right now. It requires an imagined premise to make sense.
92560	97920	That imagined premise being an audience of easily offended left-wing people. And with that imagined
97920	101920	audience in mind as the target, conservative comedians put very little effort into making
101920	106960	jokes that are actually funny. Here's an example from Gutfeld, a late-night conservative comedy
107280	124160	hosted by Greg Gutfeld. It's not the strongest gesture of faith in your joke when you take a
124160	128880	moment to explain it to the audience. This whole opening monologue is responding to the mainstream
128880	133680	media pointing out how unfunny one of Gutfeld's jokes is, and he farms that for several minutes
133760	138320	of weak jokes that are hitting back against the mainstream media. Things aren't much better on
138320	143040	YouTube with the likes of JP Sears basically making the same joke in every video where he acts as
143040	149680	though he's just discovered sarcasm. I can say, hand on heart, honest to Karl Marx, mandates are
149680	155600	indeed the path to freedom. So could we all please just quit being skeptical so we don't fall into
155600	161200	the dangerous trap of thinking for ourselves? That small example is pretty much this guy's
161200	166160	entire comedy shtick in a nutshell. He does this sarcastic impression of some imagined person on
166160	171120	the left. And by the left, by the way, this can mean everything from moderate politicians and
171120	175120	media outlets to activists on the street fighting for social change. Because in the world of
175120	179600	conservative comedy, wanting to give blankets to the homeless and abolishing nation-states are
179600	186240	basically the same thing. It's all just the left. None of this stuff is clever or nuanced satire.
186240	191200	It's just lazy references to imagined other, expressing anger and hatred rather than humor.
191200	195440	And there's no worse offender of this than the Babylon Bee. In a video of what they claim are
195440	200800	their best sketches of 2021, you have to stop voicing your opinions or that thing will kill us.
202800	207040	I agree with Martin Luther King Jr. that we should judge someone by the content of their character
207040	210560	and not by the color of their skin. You just got us killed!
211520	215200	I judge everything through the lens of rage!
215200	220080	All their humor is basically the slam cartoon, over and over again. All of this is probably
220080	223440	just review because I'm sure a lot of you saw that some more news video about conservative
223440	227600	comedy, but I was curious what it would be like to really engage with a single piece
227600	232880	of conservative comedy media. And knowing what I would be in for, I decided that piece would be
232880	238640	the Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness. And in this case, I guess the only joke here is on me.
239280	243200	This book is presented in the tradition of other comedy outlets needing to sell some stuff.
243200	247760	The Daily Show had its textbook parodies, America, The Book, and Earth, The Book. The
247760	252880	Colbert Report had I Am America and So Can You and America Again. And The Onion has published
252880	257760	over 10 different books ranging from original content to reprints of previously published work.
257760	262000	The Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness presents itself as a humorous book looking at what
262000	266320	wokeness really means and how it works in the real world. And while it's largely an excuse
266320	270960	to tell some bad jokes, it does expect, at least to some degree, to be taken seriously.
270960	274880	In an interview with the Heartland Institute, Babylon Bee managing editor and co-author of
274880	283280	this book, Joel Barry, explained. We wanted a kind of a light, silly critique that is substantive.
283280	291040	You know, we did our research and we wanted to make it accurate and insightful. He doesn't
291040	295360	describe everything he's read on the subject, but he does name check one person. Have a guess at
295360	299680	which of these two people they went to further research. It's a much more dynamic and complicated
299680	304480	relationship than you're talking about. And as far as sort of structures that, again, you're making
304480	307760	a connection between structures in terms of institutional structures that I was talking about
307760	311120	and the particular type of structures that, say, a salsora would be talking about in terms of
311120	314480	structuralism. That's not actually what I was talking about. And that's not what most people
314480	317680	are talking about when they talk about systems and structures. Again, that's a very tight
317680	322160	correlation you draw. But if we were to accept that correlation, then sure. But it's not only
322160	326320	that we're not accepting it, it's actually not what we're talking about. And postmodernism, again,
326320	332160	plays upon a range of things. I'm sorry? I said, you know, a lot about this, actually.
332160	337680	It was noted sword dancer James Lindsay, who the Babylon be cited as an expert on wokeness. Maybe
337680	342320	they also looked up Mark Lamont Hill, but reading this book, it has the same forced misunderstandings
342320	348000	of its subject that Lindsay has. For example, in James Lindsay's mind, the term inclusion
348000	354000	is a communism. Covid policy is a communism. And justice is also a communism. Everything is
354000	358560	communism. If wokeness is a buzzword that means whatever conservatives are trying to vilify,
358560	363120	Lindsay is a great source for that. Each section of this book is dedicated to goofing on and
363120	367600	explaining left-wing perspectives on culture war issues such as race and gender. And before we go
367600	372880	into detail, let's take care of something incredibly obvious right away. This book does indeed
372880	378000	make use of the one joke. For those that don't know, the one joke is a transphobic remark where
378000	383680	someone says they identify as something abstract, mocking anyone who identifies with a particular
383680	388080	gender that differs from one that they were assigned at birth. Here's an example from this
388080	394240	book. Batman is extremely insensitive to people who identify as bats. That's what the jokes are
394240	398800	going to be like. Get ready for more of that. While the Babylon be is certainly not below making that
398800	403440	joke non-stop, as you can see from their second most popular video on YouTube, this book is
403440	408720	surprisingly light on the one joke. In fact, it instead recycles a number of jokes. An early
408720	414720	example is in the introduction of this book where we get this. I think game? Though it doesn't really
414720	418080	have any rules for what you're supposed to do with those folks in the road. So I'm not sure if this
418080	423040	is supposed to be a game or some kind of flowchart for how your life's gonna go. The ironic finish
423040	428240	here is avoiding becoming red-pilled so you can be woke. The most common non-ending space, aside
428240	433440	from blank spaces where they didn't bother coming up with a joke, is the phrase, scream at sky. That
433440	439600	is a reference to this image. This was from a 2017 clip of someone expressing their anguish over
439600	444320	Donald Trump being elected president, and it has been used endlessly since then to mock people on
444320	449280	the left who aren't particularly fond of Donald Trump being the president. And if you think my
449280	454160	jump here is a little unfair, assuming this text refers to this particular image, the book helpfully
454160	459760	uses this exact phrase as a label for this exact image when it makes the same joke a little later
459760	466160	on. And of course this image appears in the book again and again and again. Here's something to
466160	471040	consider. Was joke funnier the third time or the fifth time? Or maybe it was never that funny,
471040	475440	but it does signify a person that the right is supposed to laugh at, and pointing out an angry
475440	480800	person on the left is more important than creating original or funny jokes, or in this case a joke at
480800	486400	all. This is just pointing at a person and laughing because they're upset. In addition to mocking the
486400	491280	left, this book also smugly acts as though it owns all the facts, and it makes this joke multiple
491280	496640	times. One of its favorite ways of doing that is by stating that 2 plus 2 equals 4, symbolizing how
496640	502240	the left denies obvious facts like this one. This is another joke they make many times in this book,
502240	508080	many, many times. The book doesn't really trade in hard facts though. Most of the basic facts in
508080	512960	this book it does get right, but it's usually the bare minimum of understanding how the world
512960	518880	works, and it certainly miscounts the left so badly that it's virtually unrecognizable. For example,
518880	523520	here's an excerpt from the chapter on American history. The Civil Rights Movement was the worst
523520	528480	thing to happen in America since slavery. In it, a right-wing, left-wing communist Christian
528480	533440	revolutionary liberator and white nationalist named Martin Luther King Jr. encouraged everyone
533440	539520	to judge people by their character instead of the color of their skin. Not very woke, MLK. He also
539520	544560	advocated for desegregation, which caused whiteness to poison the safe spaces black Americans had
544560	550320	worked so hard to build. Tragic. Obviously the joke here is that this is how the modern left
550320	555200	supposedly reads history, incoherent and backwards. Martin Luther King Jr. was a prominent figure in
555200	560880	the Civil Rights Movement, obviously. That is one of the few facts that this book couldn't possibly
560880	565280	get wrong, and those are the only facts it really tries to present, never going past anything more
565280	571040	complicated than 2 plus 2 equals 4. On occasion, it does go out on a limb, such as in the science
571040	575920	section where it mistakes gender and sex, to back up its claim that the left is attacking biology,
575920	580400	but that's about as far as it'll go at approaching any fact that might confuse a person over the age
580400	585040	of 10. It also reveals the depth at which they understand any of the topics they're talking about.
585040	589040	They might get basic facts that any child could understand right, and then fails completely
589040	593120	because they have no real understanding of the facts that are being discussed or how the other
593120	598080	side even sees them. Let's go back to the MLK passage though. This is also making an implicit
598080	602560	fact claim behind this joke, that the left doesn't understand the message of Martin Luther King Jr.
602560	607280	and are instead perverting it to fit some kind of woke agenda. It's the sort of thing you would
607280	612320	hear on Fox News, ignoring the radical politics of MLK, such as his support for union movements
612320	617280	or opposing American imperialism. This book has a very bland, watered down, great school version
617280	621280	in mind when it speaks of Martin Luther King Jr., presenting him as a man who wanted people to be
621280	626560	less judgmental and not advocate for social justice. Its jokes and humor only work if you're
626560	631520	completely ignorant of the subjects they're talking about. The book spends a lot of time complaining
631520	637760	about the violence at BLM protests, often casting BLM and Antifa as the villains. For it to turn
637760	642960	around with this nonsense as though they're the ones truly venerating Martin Luther King Jr.
642960	648160	is a bit strange. Here's what he said about violent protests back in the 1967 speech,
648160	656480	the other America. I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air.
657600	666000	Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously
666880	673680	as we condemn riots, but in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard.
674560	678720	The Babylon Bee takes violence at Black Lives Matter demonstrations as the perfect chance to
678720	684720	compare demonstrators in BLM to the Ku Klux Klan, and then makes a joke about Satan being a part of
684720	690480	BLM. And they do all of this while pretending to revere the civil rights movements of the 1960s.
690480	694160	I guess this is the part where the joke is supposed to be making the left angry. Obviously,
694160	699120	this is an offensive thing. But when you look at these jokes, would you have been upset had I not
699120	704320	explain the context here? And that's where they fail. This very lame graphic of Satan being in
704320	710080	BLM is so boring that when I read it the first time, it barely elicited an eye roll. You really
710080	715200	have to take a moment to consider the context and think about these jokes to realize the racism on
715200	720000	display here. One of the failures of this book is that it does say some offensive stuff, but it's
720000	724800	so lazy and uninspired that it can't even get that offended reaction without some left-wing
724800	729280	YouTuber taking a few minutes to explain the context of why this joke is so offensive. If you
729280	734400	need me to do the job of angering the left over your lame comedy, you're failing pretty hard at
734400	739120	it. The guys at the Babylon Bee get their guffaws from how the mainstream media sometimes fact
739120	744080	checks their work. They assume this is because the left is too stupid to notice that it's satire,
744080	748560	which isn't really the case. Part of the reason it needs to be fact checked is because,
748560	752720	to some degree, their own audience believes some of this stuff is true. Here are some real
752720	756720	reviews I found of the book from its Goodreads page. I've been doing a fair amount of reading
756720	762720	and research on wokeness recently as I'm teaching a bible class on the topic for my congregation,
762720	767280	and as I say, I was particularly struck by the fact that the Bee's Guide to Wokeness,
767280	772080	for all its humorous parody and satire, offers a pretty good summary overview of what wokeness
772080	777840	really is and entails. It's so funny because it is so true. Defining and explaining wokeness is
777840	782560	extremely funny because it is nonsensical. This should replace many college textbooks.
782560	787280	It would be cheaper and much more direct. Be prepared to be hashtag more woke. Yes,
787280	792080	it's hashtag satire, so this is a funny and, sadly too often, true book.
792720	797440	In research done by Ohio State University, they found that not only are right-wing readers more
797440	801840	likely to believe ideas that the Babylon Bee packages as satire, they're more likely to believe
801840	806960	them than left-wing audiences will believe a satirical story from The Onion. The Babylon Bee
806960	811200	has fired back at this study, claiming it to be flawed in that it didn't present the headlines
811200	815680	of its stories verbatim, but the story used the same technique for The Onion headlines,
815680	820800	and it also misses the point being made. What this study reveals is that right-wing audiences
820800	825520	are more prone to see truth in this type of satire. It's not unlike how certain audiences
825520	830000	would look at sitcom characters such as Archie Bunker or Al Bundy as heroes when they were
830000	834720	supposed to be mocked. At least in those cases, though, the jokes were actually funny.
834720	837440	Also, if you want to learn about Al Bundy being a hero, check out my video on Married
837440	840320	with Children. Why not? The link's down below. Anyway, back to this.
840320	844000	I wish I had a clever transition for this, but I don't. Here's another stupid thing
844000	848960	in the Babylon Bee Guide to Wokeness. It's the worst drawing I've ever seen of Elon Musk.
848960	853600	All artists deserve to get paid, and whoever drew this deserves to be paid with
853600	857280	a free copy of this book. That would be a fitting, ironic punishment.
857280	860720	Another way this book really hurts itself is when it more or less gives away how it
860720	864880	writes a bunch of its jokes with its Oppression Identifier Generator.
864880	868320	Let's play it quickly and see what we get. We'll use the name of a stupid dead person
868320	878560	so not to offend anyone. Rush Hudson Limpaugh. He would be a crazy-eyed pansexual Calvinist
880240	886880	with bear lungs. Yeah. Post your own Babylon Bee joke name in the comments. The first person to
886880	891360	laugh has to unsubscribe from my channel. The book then offers a few examples of this game
891360	895120	being played out with some helpful drawings, and this is really how a lot of Babylon Bee
895120	899920	humor works. Just string together random words like it's mad libs, and vaguely gesture at how
899920	904320	the left cares about too many different kinds of victimhood. This tactic combines itself with
904320	910400	another internet content favorite, and that's lists. Lots and lots of lists. A list of oppressed
910400	914640	religions, a list of good and bad countries, a list of things that are racist, a list of things
914640	919120	leftists do and don't think are important, a list of language not to use, a list of black people
919120	923840	the left hates, a list of ways to stop being white, and a list for spotting hidden racism.
923840	929360	And those are just the lists before Chapter 3. These lists are a convenient way to not actually
929360	933600	write jokes, while a small number, such as the list for spotting hidden racism, actually make
933600	938560	an effort. The rest are just some words that are meant to be instantly hilarious. Here's an example
938560	944000	under a list of racist things. They include drinking milk. Because it's white. That's the
944080	949600	whole joke there. It could have been anything white really. Building a snowman, using shaving foam,
949600	953920	blowing your nose with a tissue, drawing on a blank piece of paper, or painting a room white.
953920	957440	I'm halfway through making another list, and all I had to do was spend one minute looking around
957440	962480	my apartment and glancing out the window. This is a very lazy book. Another thing I noticed in this
962480	966560	book is it doesn't seem to understand how Venn diagrams work. Here's an example I found that
966560	970960	shows how each circle represents a quality an animal can have. An example of those animals when
970960	976400	those circles intersect. This is just how Venn diagrams work. Here's one from the Babylon
976400	980960	Bee Guide to Wokeness. It supposedly describes how intersectionalism works, and I gather the joke
980960	985040	here is that it's not supposed to make sense, and that the left-wing people who believe this are too
985040	990080	dumb to put it together. That's why the intersection of nationality and the power of flight is...
990080	996480	werewolf. It's not really a joke, because none of those things are really connected, and overlapping
996480	1001600	nationality and the power of flight producing werewolf is just a weird on sequitur. It's mad
1001600	1006080	libs all over again. Throw random words together, point at the bad group, and say this is what they
1006080	1010560	really believe. And if the person making this joke doesn't understand how to use these visual graphics,
1010560	1015360	they can instead flip that around and say it's also satire. You might say that this whole book
1015360	1020160	is some kind of deeply clever psych out that I'm not getting. That the seemingly lazy and thoughtless
1020160	1024320	jokes are all a parody of the left, and since they're being sarcastic, any criticism directed
1024320	1030080	towards them is deflected onto the group they're parroting instead. Except the lazy hypothesis
1030080	1035680	extends beyond this book. Before the Babylon Bee slid firmly into right-wing culture war stuff,
1035680	1040480	it was primarily a comedy website making fun of the excesses of religious communities. For example,
1040480	1044960	they would run articles with headlines such as, there's a 15, maybe 20% chance I'll remember to
1044960	1048960	pray for you, brother. It does still touch on religion today, though it doesn't quite get the
1048960	1052960	same love and attention that the culture war stuff does. In the Babylon Bee's Guide to Wokeness,
1052960	1057120	I paid special attention to its chapter on religion. The whole section feels like a bit
1057120	1061600	of a reach, as the left isn't really known for its religious zeal, but it does have a go at
1061600	1066000	claiming the left is trying to reframe Jesus as woke, and is trying to turn churches into
1066000	1070800	left-wing project centers. It also takes lazy, partisan political swipes. Here's one example
1070800	1076160	in the section explaining how woke Jesus is. When Lazarus died, Jesus raised him from the dead so he
1076160	1080960	could vote Democrat. Jesus performed this miracle a few times, raising hordes of people from the
1080960	1084640	dead and leading them straight over to the voting booth so they could cast their vote for a
1084640	1089200	Democratic candidate. Democrats are following in his footsteps, and are still performing this
1089200	1094480	miracle today. This is another example of what this book constantly does, mushing together basic
1094480	1099440	liberal actions with radical movements. Voting for the Democrats in an election is preferable
1099440	1103920	to the alternative, but it's hardly the type of radical left-wing politics this book is claiming
1103920	1108480	to lampoon. The important part here is that this section reflects the book's obvious partisan
1108480	1112640	leanings. It's about attacking the left on all front, from radical politics to electoralism.
1112640	1117360	It's a flattening of perspectives to make lazy jokes. The main point here is that this book is
1117360	1122720	trying to portray the left as co-opting Christianity to advance its political agenda. That was most
1122720	1127200	apparent at the end of this chapter when it references The Screwtape Letters, a novel written
1127200	1131600	by C.S. Lewis that's presented as a collection of letters from a senior demon named Screwtape
1131600	1136800	sent to his nephew Wormwood. The Babylon B book highlights this specific excerpt from the novel.
1136800	1142560	We do want, and want very much, to make men treat Christianity as a means, preferably of course as
1142560	1148240	a means to their own advancement, but, failing that, as a means to anything, even to social justice.
1148240	1153760	The thing to do is to get a man at first to value social justice as a thing which the enemy demands,
1153760	1158480	and then work him on to the stage at which he values Christianity because it may produce social
1158480	1163120	justice, for the enemy will not be used as a convenience. It's making the same point as the
1163120	1166640	chapter that the left is co-opting the church to further its political project, which is
1166640	1171200	inappropriate since a church should not be used as a tool for one's politics. You might be wondering
1171200	1175600	how the Democratic Party is particularly guilty of this when you're far more likely to see those in
1175600	1180800	the Republican Party invoke God and Christian piety. I found this exact C.S. Lewis quote in
1180800	1185120	another book, though, written in a similar sarcastic tone, only it took a slightly different
1185120	1189280	approach. Here's an excerpt that followed the reading of this Screwtape passage.
1189280	1193840	Christianity should only be valued insofar as it helps us win political battles and shape the
1193840	1198720	social landscape. What's the point of having the power of God in the Gospel and the indwelling Holy
1198720	1202640	Spirit if we don't use it to our advantage, such as winning the White House, the Supreme Court,
1202640	1206880	and the Congress for our political party and advancing our own hot-button social issues?
1206880	1211200	It's the best of both worlds. We get to hang out with our homeboy Jesus, but we still get the
1211200	1215920	recognition and accolades of the world. So what are you waiting for? Get on over to the nearest GOP
1215920	1220560	campaign office and start getting involved. While the Guide to Wokeness uses the C.S. Lewis
1220560	1225040	quote to mock the left for being the one to mix politics and religion, this particular book flips
1225040	1229440	the equation to call out the right for doing the same thing. And this mystery book I'm talking
1229440	1234720	about happens to be How to Be a Perfect Christian, your comprehensive guide to flawless spiritual
1234720	1240320	living written by, would you look at that, the Babylon Bee. How to Be a Perfect Christian was
1240320	1245520	written all the way back in 2019, and I guess a lot can change in two years because reading this
1245520	1250320	first book you find excerpts like these. The Democratic Party was founded in 1883 as the
1250320	1254320	dying wish of Karl Marx because he wanted to infiltrate the once God-fearing nation with his
1254320	1259600	evil communist ideas. Did I mention this book was written with the same sort of sarcastic tone that
1259600	1264320	the Guide to Wokeness was? How to Be a Perfect Christian also hits us with one of their signature
1264320	1271520	lazy lists. Helpful terms for arguing with Democrats online. Libtard. Snowflake. I'm not
1271520	1277920	a racist, but... Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps. Food stamp junkie. Godless commie.
1277920	1282400	One of these really sticks out, and that's I'm not a racist, but, and let's contrast this with
1282400	1287760	a little excerpt from the Guide to Wokeness. This comes from its list of secret signs of racism.
1287760	1292960	Three, you say I'm not a racist. This is an obvious one. If you say I'm not a racist,
1292960	1297200	or I don't hate people for their skin color, you are definitely a racist. Because guess what?
1297200	1302240	That's exactly what a racist would say. The irony here of course is that the first book mocks how
1302240	1307440	the right often portrays the left as a caricature, and then the second book just embraces the
1307440	1312720	caricature, acting like the very people the first book was mocking. Here's another fun excerpt from
1312720	1317920	How to Be a Perfect Christian. But we do have a word of warning for you, brave Christian Republican
1317920	1322560	soldier. The most important thing you can remember as you bravely head off to the front lines to fight
1322560	1327760	for Jesus in the culture wars is this. You are always being persecuted. The Guide to Wokeness,
1327760	1332800	of course, makes a number of references to Christians being persecuted, such as this excerpt.
1332800	1336880	But whatever religion you pick, make sure it's an oppressed, exotic, unique belief system that you
1336880	1341360	can score you woke points, and not something basic and lame like Christianity. If you must be a
1341360	1345200	Christian though, because your lame parents make you go to church as long as you live under their
1345200	1350160	floor or whatever, co-opt Christianity for social justice. The only good church is a woke church.
1350720	1355520	You can see the style here hasn't really evolved. It's all done with the same sort of sarcastic
1355520	1360160	roleplay of the group they're trying to mock. Where the Babylon B stands becomes a bit tougher
1360160	1365200	to figure out when you compare these two books. The jokes still aren't terribly funny, but this
1365200	1369280	book does actually go pretty hard against Republicans for about a chapter, complaining
1369280	1373200	about how they co-opt religion to advance their political goals. It even mocks conservative
1373200	1377600	icons such as Ronald Reagan, Rush Limbaugh, and Bill O'Reilly. How to Be a Perfect Christian
1377600	1382960	is about how Christianity is used by disingenuous people in order to feel smugly superior. And the
1382960	1387200	Guide to Wokeness, the chapter on religion is making the same point, only now it's claiming
1387200	1391920	the left is doing this, and not the right. You might assume this is the Babylon B claiming to
1391920	1396800	not really be a partisan political operation, not choosing one side over the other. Only that
1396800	1402000	isn't true. The Guide to Wokeness is absolutely advancing a partisan political project. Whereas
1402000	1407120	the How to Be a Perfect Christian has one chapter about partisan politics, instead mostly focusing
1407120	1412080	on criticizing superficial acts of faith, the Guide to Wokeness is explicitly an anti-left book,
1412080	1416960	with nods of appreciation to the right. It is clearly chosen a side here. You might be wondering
1416960	1421360	how this happened. And it may not be as simple as the Babylon B writers being a bunch of lazy,
1421360	1425360	soulless grifters who recycle jokes to make easy money from a gullible audience.
1425360	1430000	How to Be a Perfect Christian was written by Adam Ford and Kyle Mann. In late 2018,
1430000	1434560	Ford, who had founded the website, sold it to Seth Dillon and moved on to other projects. So
1434560	1438240	while Ford still has a financial stake in the outlet he created, he doesn't have any role in
1438240	1442720	producing its content. So it's quite possible that Ford's voice, which may have included critiques of
1442720	1447760	hypocritical Christians on the political right, is just no longer part of the Babylon B's output.
1447760	1451920	Though that doesn't stop them from bringing up the same points he does, right down to the same
1451920	1456640	C.S. Lewis quote, and lazily flipping those jokes to be about the other side of the political aisle.
1456640	1461600	Or it's possible that the same set of jokes came from How to Be a Perfect Christian's other author,
1461600	1466240	Kyle Mann, who still works at the Babylon B and also is one of the co-authors of The Guide to
1466240	1470320	Wokeness. And he'll make the same lame jokes about anyone so long as he's getting paid.
1470320	1474640	Speaking to The Atlantic, Mann described the joy he gets from his humor like this.
1491600	1518080	His point doesn't really make sense here because saying something isn't funny isn't really the same
1518080	1523600	as being upset. If anything, it's absence of a reaction, not laughing, and then informing the
1523600	1528560	person telling the joke that it sucks. But I want to focus on the point about how the Babylon B is
1528560	1533840	making some kind of meta-commentary, ironically mocking boomer jokes, a special in-joke that
1533840	1538640	only they're getting. But if they are mocking boomer jokes, it's not even consistent with an
1538640	1541680	earlier comment from that same interview where this exchange happened.
1548080	1571440	The Babylon B is an unapologetic outlet for boomer humor. Except when you point out how
1571440	1576400	bad their jokes are, then they're actually mocking boomer humor. Regardless of how they defend their
1576400	1581120	weak humor though, The Babylon B's Guide to Wokeness is a deeply lazy book. Recycling jokes
1581120	1585120	throughout its run, some borrowed from memes that are nearly five years old, doing the bare minimum
1585120	1590240	to vaguely gestured humor with effortless lists, and in some cases reusing jokes from books they
1590240	1594560	published a few years ago. Going back to the Heartland Institute, The Guide to Wokeness' co-author
1594560	1599360	Joel Berry said, the book only took a few months to write, which sounds, if anything, slightly
1599360	1603040	longer than I would have guessed. Here's one particular part of the interview I enjoyed.
1607120	1614000	We do these kind of funny corporate art style stick figure infographics where we're
1614000	1622240	explaining how to do something silly. We wanted a kind of a light, silly critique that is substantive.
1623040	1630160	We did our research and we wanted to make it accurate and insightful if you want to read it
1630160	1634640	cover to cover. But it's also just something you can pick up and there's going to be a joke,
1634640	1638640	no matter what page you turn to, a funny picture. And it's just silly, you know,
1638640	1642560	we felt like people needed to laugh at this whole movement. And let's go back to how to be a perfect
1642560	1648240	Christian one last time. The best way to engage in conversation with those of opposing worldviews is
1648240	1653040	to misrepresent their positions using a hilarious meme or graphic and then plaster it all over the
1653040	1660160	internet. I hope the irony isn't lost on anyone. A few of my patrons had questions about this video
1660160	1665040	and I want to answer them here. A few people asked me if there was any part of this or any part of
1665040	1671360	the Babylombie's output that I found genuinely humorous. That's a very good and challenging
1671360	1676960	question to answer. I think the closest I got to laughing is in its list of handy tips for being
1676960	1683440	less white. They aren't great jokes, but they reveal a level of self-awareness that shows
1683440	1689120	an actual familiarity about stereotypes around white people. Smash your Taylor Swift albums or
1689120	1693520	buy hot sauce or donate your new balances to goodwill. With a little effort, these could have
1693520	1698960	been good jokes. They're sort of mediocre otherwise. They are the closest I got to laughing
1698960	1705120	though, so that was something. Another person asked if a real human being has ever genuinely
1705120	1711760	laughed at a joke delivered by Greg Gutfeld. Probably not. Probably not. Another question asked
1711760	1717040	was, is there a way for conservative humor to be good? And I think, yeah, probably. The problem is
1717040	1722400	conservative audiences should be more demanding, I hope, and I think it takes a real effort to make
1722400	1726880	people who disagree with you politically laugh, and that effort simply isn't there amongst
1726880	1733040	conservative comedians who can just play to these very easy, basic narratives and not really work on
1733040	1737760	creating meaningful or good jokes. Like the aforementioned list of things people can do to
1737760	1742320	stop being white, there were some ideas there that could have been fashioned into real joke if even
1742320	1747440	some kind of effort was put into it. And I do think left-wingers can fall into the same exact
1747440	1752560	trap of creating cheap jokes but still getting a laugh out of them because they're targeted at
1752560	1757040	the right person. If you would like to ask some questions to possibly get them answered at the end
