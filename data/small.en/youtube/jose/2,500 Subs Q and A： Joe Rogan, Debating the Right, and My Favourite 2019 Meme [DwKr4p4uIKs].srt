1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,240
Hey everyone, I am here with my promised Q&A, and I got a bunch of questions on Curious Cat,

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,400
and I'm gonna do my best to answer them right now. The first question. After your brilliant

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:17,120
video on Dave Rubin, thank you, there have been a number of other great video analyses covering

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,320
other aspects of why he and his show are so flawed and dishonest. Now that Rubin's been

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,800
covered so well, do you think Joe Rogan should be next to receive this treatment?

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,400
The Cerst did a video on his show being the start of an alt-right pipeline, but otherwise

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,160
there's been very little from leftist YouTube criticizing him and his show directly, mostly

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,400
just of individual guests on it. The real difficulty with covering Joe Rogan is that he has

9
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,520
so much content. It would take literally thousands of hours of listening to his stuff to get a sense

10
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,720
of what his show is about and how he's evolved and changed over the years. Personally, I don't have

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,000
the time to invest in this. If I could come up with an angle to tackle this, I would be interested

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,400
in doing that, but until I come up with that angle, which would mean a more focused and narrower

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,560
domain when it comes to the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, sadly I'll have to pass on this for now,

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,720
but who knows what the future will bring, and if I get that right angle, I'll go for it.

15
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:28,000
Next question. Is municipal tap water in Canada drinkable? Yeah, generally speaking it is. In any

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,360
major city, you can drink the tap water and you'll be just fine. That's not always true if you live

17
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,280
on a reservation of some kind. This typically affects more remote areas of Canada, and I don't

18
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:45,600
know too much about this subject. The debate is generally framed as a mix of governmental

19
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,680
incompetence and corruption within the tribal system as the government's treatment of Indigenous

20
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,840
peoples in Canada has generally ranged from bad to awful. If you're in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver,

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,360
whatever, you're gonna be fine. Next question. What are your thoughts on the state of educational

22
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,040
television in Canada? I live in Alberta and recently our CTV2 affiliate, originally an

23
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:14,240
education channel for the province, stopped airing their educational programming. I don't like the

24
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:20,000
sound of educational programming being taken away from anywhere. Honestly, this question I don't

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,440
have a very good answer for, so you'll have to excuse me. Instead of giving you a half an ass,

26
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,240
kind of like, sort of maybe this, I'm gonna have to do something you don't see enough of on YouTube

27
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:38,080
and just say, I don't know, I'm not knowledgeable about this, and I'd have to do some real research

28
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:43,840
and some real digging to give you an actual answer that has some semblance of knowledge or insight

29
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,880
into the situation. Shooting from the hip about a topic I know very little about is just something

30
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:56,160
I don't enjoy doing, and I think it's something people should do way less of, way, way less of

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,880
on YouTube. Next question. Will you remember us when you're famous? I don't think I'm ever gonna

32
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:08,800
be famous, and I kind of like that. There are a lot of good things that come with fame, usually

33
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,000
some sort of financial stability, a lot of opportunities to do exciting and new things,

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,240
and I'd rather have all of those perks and none of the downsides. Fame isn't really a goal with this,

35
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,040
but if I do become famous, of course, I will remember you, anonymous question asker. How could

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,840
I forget? Opinion of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Remember what I said about not

37
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,960
commenting on things I don't know anything about? I know nothing about this. The only

38
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:44,720
sentiment I could possibly offer here is that I hope this Commonwealth does right by the people

39
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,240
of Poland and Lithuania. I'm gonna not talk about it, otherwise I'm gonna be like Dave Rubin with

40
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,120
his commentary on Bolsonaro and his getting rid of the SJW stuff. No one needs that. No one needs

41
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,880
that on YouTube. Next question. Why are my YouTube recommends so terrible? I'm guessing you watched

42
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:08,800
a single video by, I don't know, Sargon of Akkad? Maybe you watched a quartering video? That

43
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,240
usually kills your recommendations and suddenly you're down this grotesque anti-SJW rabbit hole.

44
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:19,680
It's the YouTube algorithm. It's pretty garbage. I have a separate YouTube account I use for my

45
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,280
research, so it's got the worst recommendations, which helps when I'm researching a video, but

46
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,760
whenever I'm watching my own stuff I log into a different account. Why would I waste time

47
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,400
logging into an account that's just going to give me garbage videos? I'm glad people stopped

48
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,880
making those Captain Marvel videos because my recommendations for about two weeks after I made

49
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:45,440
that video about Get Woke Go Broke being a lie was just angry stupid. Oh Captain Marvel's gonna

50
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,560
fail videos and by the way, quick callback to that video. How much money did that make on its

51
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,880
opening weekend again? Oh yeah, like nearly half a billion dollars. So Get Woke Go Broke my ass.

52
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,120
I usually don't take a victory lap, but damn that one felt good. Next question. Dear Jose,

53
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,120
besides running a YouTube channel and correcting skeptics, what other passions do you have?

54
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,640
Favorite subjects in academia? Talents? Hobbies? Thank you for making this content and congratulations

55
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:19,520
for 2,500 subscribers. Thank you for the congratulations and that's four questions,

56
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,280
but since you're so nice I'm gonna answer them all. Other passions. I'm a pretty avid reader. I

57
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,800
read a lot of different types of fiction. I'm a big lover of the arts. I love creative writing.

58
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:35,520
I have not done nearly enough of it recently. I did a little bit today. It felt good, although

59
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:41,040
what I created was crap, but that's the creative process. I was trying to teach myself to draw for

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:47,680
a while. That didn't go so well, but I can still I can make decent things. I also love traveling.

61
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,200
I've been to quite a few places now. Currently my goal is to see every continent on the planet

62
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:59,680
except for Antarctica because of the ecological impact of tourism on that continent. Favorite

63
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,760
subjects in academia? Probably English literature. I studied it in university and adored it. I also

64
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:12,240
have a major in psychology, which while great, isn't quite as fun as English literature to be

65
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,480
honest. Talents. But I used to sing. I played a few instruments, never any good. Maybe writing,

66
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:25,200
I guess. That's kind of a talent. Hobbies. I do play a few video games, although not nearly as much

67
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,600
as I used to. Having a boring life, that's my hobby. Next question. What's your opinion on the

68
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:39,200
debate Nazis or don't debate Nazis debate? I think what I do on this channel is debate. And I mean

69
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:46,160
debate in that I confront terrible ideas with my ideas, which are not so terrible. I might even call

70
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:52,400
some of them good. In this channel, I try to interrogate and really test terrible ideas that

71
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,640
includes ideas not only from Nazis, but very noxious people with shitty, fascistic, wrongheaded,

72
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:06,560
toxic ideologies. In that sense, I am already part of the debate. What people usually refer to as a

73
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,680
debate, particularly when they're challenging me to a debate in the comment section is if I'll

74
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,720
actually take something like that seriously, is they want to have some sort of live stream

75
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,520
confrontation where people will shout at each other while trying to trip them up with these

76
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,640
silly rhetorical games and pedantic gotcha moments where they're trying to score points

77
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,280
in some sort of absurd performance that's really more a mockery of debate and discourse. I would

78
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,320
join in with the knowledge that what I am doing is not actually debating someone. This is some sort

79
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,840
of weird performance that we're engaged in for an audience that is often under the delusion that

80
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,320
they're seeing ideas clash in some sort of real-time environment. That's not really how people figure

81
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,680
out what is or isn't true. If we're talking about academia, for instance, you'll see that in the

82
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,840
literature. That's where the ideas will really come into clash and you'll see real debate happen

83
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,280
because people will have time to research and think about their responses and provide evidence.

84
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,880
We're not really set up as human beings to be debating machines where you can just

85
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:17,280
plop down on a stage and rattle off a bunch of facts. That's why you see these fact-free debaters

86
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:22,480
thrive in that environment because you can't really match them one-on-one because they don't

87
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:28,080
use facts to begin with. So they're just debating from their gut using their opinions and feelings

88
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,800
as if these are somehow evidence for their arguments. They aren't. They're just using

89
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,840
debating tactics to win over an audience. Apart from leftist content, would you ever put your

90
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:43,120
fingers in different video essay pies? My next video is going to be very much a departure and

91
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:48,480
a different kind of video essay. It will be technically leftist content but it's going to

92
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,360
be very different. I don't want to spoil the surprise just yet but I hope people give it a

93
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:58,880
shot and I think people are going to hate it or love it and really those are the only two extremes

94
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,040
I'm interested in. As for the future, I have so many ideas and things I'd love to do but I'm not

95
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:11,680
ready to spill the beans on those just yet. Next question. Why is your voice so damn sexy?

96
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,000
I think that's a question you can answer better than I can. I don't think my voice is anything

97
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,120
terribly special to be honest. The reason it sounds a little bassy is because I actually turn

98
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:30,080
up the bass a little when I'm mixing my audio. I kind of like it and I guess you do too.

99
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:38,160
Next question. Do you enjoy watching cartoons or animes? Not nearly as much as I used to and

100
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,440
that's more a product of just having less free time as I get older and you don't get much time

101
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,360
for watching stuff sadly but I do have a couple of cartoons I enjoy. BoJack Horseman on Netflix

102
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,040
is great. My favorite show of all time, if we're only counting seasons 2 through 9,

103
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:00,720
could very well be The Simpsons. I used to watch a fair amount of anime and generally fallen off

104
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,400
of that as well but my favorite TV series of all time as a complete package because it did not dip

105
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:11,280
in quality like The Simpsons but it was good and pure and wonderful through its entire run.

106
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:16,960
That is Nana. I mentioned it in my comic skate video and I will absolutely mention it again here.

107
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:22,560
The anime was just so good it will shatter your heart and make you a better person for having

108
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:29,280
had that happen. Other all-time favorite anime are my favorite movie ever Princess Mononoke and

109
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,680
really anything by Studio Ghibli but Spirited Away and Howl's Moving Castle are two of my other

110
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:39,520
favorites. Cowboy Bebop is still one of my favorite shows of all time. I also loved Gundam

111
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:45,520
Seed, a show that is both over and underrated if that's possible. Before anyone asks I'm not

112
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,280
a huge fan of most other Gundam shows although I have watched quite a few.

113
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:56,080
What's your favorite meme of this year so far? I'm tempted to say the Fiji water girl was my

114
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,280
favorite but the one that made me laugh the hardest this year was the hallway pizza guy.

115
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:08,240
I'm gonna just play the video. Next question, are you optimistic about the future? Yes, I actually

116
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:14,320
am optimistic about the future. If I thought things were going badly and would continue to go badly

117
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,320
I'd probably give up so it's a practical optimism. While researching a topic that has nothing to do

118
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,000
with any of the videos I made I was learning more about millennial compensation and that increasingly

119
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,680
something millennials are finding rewarding in compensation for their employment is some sort of

120
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:40,000
positive social benefit. Instead of just asking for a higher salary they also enjoy compensation

121
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,200
that includes an employer that will donate money to a worthy cause or institute programs that give

122
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:53,840
back to the community. I think this is a signifier of the values of the younger generation coming up

123
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,240
and I really hope and believe we can hold on to these values in the future where we're not just

124
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,600
looking to make the most of our own lives in our world but improve the lives of everyone around us.

125
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:08,960
That's the sort of thing that makes me optimistic. Next question, how much can you lift?

126
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:18,880
So I only really use dumbbells and for those I'm currently at uh 22 and a half pounds for each

127
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:26,320
dumbbell which is okay I guess I don't know. I lift weights maybe twice a week. I'm not super

128
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:33,120
into it to be honest. I find other ways of staying fit. I compliment my weight lifting with a bit of

129
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:40,960
running some yoga and some calisthenics. Last question and it's a good one. Do the needs of the

130
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:49,360
many outweigh the needs of the few? Yes, yes they do. They also outweigh the needs of the one.

131
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,640
That's a Star Trek reference for everyone who doesn't know that moment in Star Trek where Spock

132
00:12:54,640 --> 00:13:02,000
sacrifices himself to save everyone and it's pretty sad. I'm more a fan of Star Trek the next

133
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,280
generation but the original series still has its own charm and I kind of love the hokiness of it.

134
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:12,480
What a way to go out on a Star Trek reference. Thanks to everyone who submitted their questions

135
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,960
and if you realize you suddenly had a question for me and you wanted me to answer it but just

136
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:21,280
you didn't submit it you can still ask me a question just submit it on curiouscat. If you

137
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:27,840
love the work I'm doing consider donating to my Patreon. Those who donate five dollars or more

138
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:34,320
will even see their name in the credits for not the next video but the one after that. I kind of

139
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,240
explained it in the previous video if you want more details but if you're the sort of person

140
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,440
who loves seeing their name in credits this is your chance and if somehow this is the first

141
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,080
video of mine you've ever seen I've got plenty of other videos on this channel you can check out

142
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,320
and they will tell you what I'll tell you now. If you like any of my videos including this one you
