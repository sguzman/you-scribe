1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
In June of 2018, Jordan Peterson launched a defamation lawsuit against Wilfrid Laurier

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,600
University for $1.5 million. This lawsuit came on the heels of a suit from former Wilfrid Laurier

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:16,880
University student Lindsay Shepherd. In that suit she claims an encounter she had with her

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:23,680
supervisor left her unemployable in academia and left some lasting emotional distress. After she

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:28,320
was reprimanded for showing a Peterson-related video in one of the classes she was a teacher's

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,600
assistant for. We don't need to guess about the timing of these two lawsuits here. Peterson

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,280
actually describes his lawsuit like this. I decided that Wilfrid Laurier had learned very

8
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,080
little from its public embarrassment and that Shepherd's claims were valid, justifiable,

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:49,600
and necessary, including her statement that her future lack of employability in academia

10
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,040
was improbable to say the least. I also decided to launch a claim of my own against the same

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:59,840
defendants. I thought that two lawsuits might make the point better than one.

12
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,920
So Peterson's suit is being filed not strictly because he's an offended party,

13
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,960
but in support of the Shepherd suit. The message he's trying to deliver is quite clear that the

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,720
faculty of Wilfrid Laurier University and presumably all university faculties across Canada

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,920
better watch what they say about him in the future. Many commenters have noted the obvious

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,080
hypocrisy here. Peterson's claim to fame involved sounding the alarm about a shadowy group of social

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,560
Marxists trying to control his language with Canadian Bill C-16, which added trans people

18
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,840
to the list of groups who were protected by hate speech laws. But now Peterson is the one trying

19
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,720
to control the language of others, or more specifically, he's trying to control the ideas

20
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:50,400
they're allowed to express behind closed doors. The hypocrisy is a fair point, but there's a deeper

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:55,120
point here about how the legal system is being used as a tool by a wealthy individual to create

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,640
a chilling effect, more commonly known as libel chill, although obviously in this case it's

23
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,600
defamation not libel. First I want to just make sure we're looking at the Peterson suit and the

24
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,360
Shepherd suit differently. While I don't agree with either, I think there's a clear difference

25
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,320
between a student who believes her university's faculty mistreated her, wrong as she may be,

26
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,960
and a professor from a different school not liking the way he's being spoken about by the same

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,520
faculty in private. What we have here is a clear case of the law being used to silence criticism.

28
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,760
It uses the legal system as a weapon and creates a chilling effect that will make

29
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,680
any other person in a Canadian university faculty, perhaps more broadly even, think twice

30
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,760
before they criticize Peterson in private in front of one of his followers.

31
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,200
For a broader look at how libel chill works, I want to talk about an incident that happened

32
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,040
in March of 2016 when pro wrestler Hulk Hogan won a lawsuit against the media outlet Gawker

33
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:58,640
for a staggering $140 million in damages after the media outlet published a sex tape he was

34
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,080
featured in. For the sake of your eyes, I won't put the footage from the sex tape on screen

35
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,760
from what I've been told the Hulkster has sex the same way he wrestles. He has three moves and never

36
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,840
goes longer than five minutes. The $140 million won by Hogan was later reduced to $31 million in

37
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,680
a settlement in November of the same year, but the damage had been done and Gawker was no more.

38
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,240
While Gawker has traipsed in controversy in the past with a series of questionable articles to

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,920
say the least, it wasn't really the Hulk Hogan sex tape that brought them down. It was a different

40
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,720
article that outed PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel as being secretly gay. While Hulk Hogan is an

41
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:46,800
American hero for daring to headbutt the flag of the Soviet Union, he didn't bankroll his lawsuit

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,840
against Gawker. It was Thiel who paid roughly $10 million for the suit, all part of a large

43
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:56,880
operation he had been funding to find ways to take the media organization down. Publishing an

44
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:03,040
article about someone being secretly gay while obviously a dick move isn't actually illegal.

45
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,360
In fact, being a public figure like Thiel means it's much harder to sue someone for what they

46
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,920
print, either online or in print. It's part of the framework of what protects the press,

47
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,320
a vital aspect of free expression. What Thiel did was bypass Gawker's free expression and use the

48
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,600
legal system to silence them forever. The effect not only ends his vendetta, it also sends a clear

49
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,040
signal to other media outlets. If they find anything salacious about him, maybe this time

50
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,680
nothing to do with his sexual life, but perhaps some kind of shady business dealings, Thiel may

51
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,440
deploy his considerable means within the legal system to exact vengeance. This is obviously

52
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,400
an extreme example, as we're talking about much higher dollar amounts at play here than in the

53
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,960
Peterson case, but keep in mind Thiel is a much wealthier man than Peterson. The difference here

54
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,760
is in scale more so than intent. And Peterson is making a statement that he is willing to put up

55
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:00,800
his money to silence criticism of him done in private. What's perhaps more disturbing about the

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,320
Peterson case is that he's suing a university and not a media outlet. This isn't an article that

57
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,240
was published somewhere, it was a private conversation in which two of the participants

58
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,040
had no reason to believe would be made public. How could they have possibly known that Shepard

59
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:19,600
was secretly recording them? And would Shepard's account have been so widely disseminated had it

60
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,400
not been for that recording? It'll be interesting to see how this lawsuit is resolved.

61
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:28,880
Peterson has been badmouthing academia since the beginning of his rise to internet fame.

62
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,600
Here are a few comments he made in a 2016 interview.

63
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,720
It might be that the university is already dying. It wouldn't surprise me. I mean, I think huge swaths

64
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,400
of the university are irrevocably corrupted. Sociology, gone. Anthropology, gone. History,

65
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,000
big chunks of it are gone. The classics, literature, social work, political science

66
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,360
in many places, and that doesn't cover women's studies, ethnic studies. They probably started

67
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,040
lost, and it's gotten far worse. I believe now, with the exception of the science, technology,

68
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:09,920
engineering, mathematics branch, that universities do more harm than good. I think they produced

69
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:14,400
indentured servants in the United States because tuition fees have gone up so much and you can't

70
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,360
declare bankruptcy on your student loans, or teaching university students lies and pandering

71
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,200
to them. And I see that as counterproductive. That's a god-awful impression, sorry about that.

72
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:30,000
We also can't forget Peterson's project to catalog the courses he considered

73
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,880
indoctrination cult classes in 2017. He only pulled back on that initiative after he cited

74
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,240
some negative responses from his twitter followers. But it demonstrates how poorly Peterson thinks of

75
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,920
certain branches of academia, and how he sees himself, or rather his philosophy, if you can

76
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:53,600
call it that, as the antidote. Peterson has also circulated a petition to try and take tax funding

77
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:00,560
away from universities. As of recording, it's sitting at 1484 signatures, so I don't think

78
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,080
that'll work. There's also his recent video for Dennis Prager's fake university, which wasn't

79
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,680
too kind to the academics instructing young minds. They are indoctrinating young minds throughout the

80
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,880
west with their resentment-ridden ideology. They have made it their life's mission to undermine

81
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,800
western civilization itself, which they regard as corrupt, oppressive, and patriarchal.

82
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,000
He presents the world of academia as some kind of Soviet nightmare where kids have cultural

83
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,080
Marxism drilled into their minds. Plenty of videos have drilled into this particular effluvia already,

84
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,680
so check those out for more information. Jordan Peterson is the academic who undermines academia,

85
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,480
much in the way Larry Elder is celebrated as a black man who undermines black activism,

86
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:49,280
Blair White as a trans woman who undermines trans activism, and Christina Hoff Sommers as

87
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,560
a woman who undermines modern feminism. None of these people are advancing anything particularly

88
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,840
new or interesting, but rather standing up for the status quo while denying any of the criticisms

89
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,640
of discrimination or bigotry faced by the groups they identify with. Many of the points they make

90
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:09,520
are often heard from conservative commentators who don't belong to their identity groups.

91
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,160
Now we have the totalitarian left in America, and if you don't see it their way,

92
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,960
you're attacked and demonized. And if you're a student, you can be punished through the

93
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,240
grading system. This cannot continue. Academic freedom is one thing. Harming students with insane

94
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,240
ideology is quite something else. That there is such a thing as indoctrination at the university.

95
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:38,880
You get in there and you're given courses, you're given seminars I should say, on how racist you

96
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:46,400
are or on how to avoid sexual harassment. The universities were largely infiltrated by a lot

97
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:51,360
of folks on the new left. The establishment at those universities decided not to challenge

98
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,960
the student body when the student body kind of rose up in the 1960s, and a lot of the

99
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,520
very bad ideas that had started earlier in the 1930s and 40s ended up taking over the universities

100
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:06,560
in the 1960s. In other words, it's a noxious corruption of identity politics where someone's

101
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,600
gender, race, or in Peterson's case career are used to give their claims more credibility,

102
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,680
when in fact all their claims are simple conservative talking points that we've been

103
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:20,400
hearing for years, but we're supposed to believe they're more credible because in this case the

104
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,080
person's identity makes them look like an insider. This all illustrates a man who is at war with the

105
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:32,000
very institution that he uses as currency for his credibility. He is the university professor who

106
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,360
was valued for his consistent criticism of the university system and used conservative talking

107
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,120
points that we've been hearing for years. This, I believe, is the key to his fame and why so many

108
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,520
conservative thinkers, talkers, and speakers have all latched on to him. This lawsuit Peterson filed

109
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,680
isn't about making money but instead about making a point, and it's a simple one. Faculty at

110
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,560
Canadian universities are on notice. They better watch what they say about Jordan Peterson.

111
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,520
As he gets wealthier, it makes me wonder what he's going to start using that money for

112
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,400
and what other voices he might try to silence.

113
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,160
Expression is never free when someone uses their wealth to make you pay a price.
