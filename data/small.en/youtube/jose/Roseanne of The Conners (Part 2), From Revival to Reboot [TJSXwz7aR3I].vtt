00:00.000 --> 00:04.480
In my first video, I went into detail about the leftist politics that are often on display

00:04.480 --> 00:09.280
throughout much of the first nine seasons of Roseanne. If you haven't watched my video,

00:09.280 --> 00:14.480
maybe give it a shot. Much like the series itself, it ended on an unsatisfying note with no meaningful

00:14.480 --> 00:19.520
conclusion. Aside from that, working class people are constantly getting crushed in a system that

00:19.520 --> 00:24.320
isn't designed to help them. This important message was brought to us by a woman who acted

00:24.320 --> 00:29.120
like the dictator of her show. It's one of the many contradictions of Roseanne Barr and her TV

00:29.120 --> 00:33.840
series, and one that a viewer such as myself struggles with. Can we salvage something of the

00:33.840 --> 00:38.880
Roseanne show in the face of Roseanne Barr's general awfulness, and truly have a show about

00:38.880 --> 00:45.680
the working class made by people who, as far as we know, aren't shitty? Can the TV sensibilities

00:45.680 --> 00:50.560
of the past still have something to say in the modern day? We add an indirect answer to that

00:50.560 --> 00:56.640
question when ABC brought back Roseanne for its 10th season in 2018. But before we get to that,

00:56.640 --> 01:00.480
let's have a quick catch-up with the cast of Roseanne before that 10th season revival.

01:03.760 --> 01:08.640
One of the true tragedies following the ending of season 9 of the series was the death of actor

01:08.640 --> 01:15.280
Glenn Quinn, who played Mark Healy. He passed away in 2002 of a drug overdose at the age of 32.

01:15.280 --> 01:19.920
Although he wouldn't be a part of the show's revival in 2018, the character was not recast,

01:19.920 --> 01:25.680
and the character of Mark died between seasons 9 and 10. Darlene's son was given the name Mark

01:25.680 --> 01:30.800
in honor of him. In that 20-year gap, Roseanne Barr became increasingly well-known for her

01:30.800 --> 01:36.480
political commentary, even running for president under the Green Party banner in 2012. In 2011,

01:36.480 --> 01:41.520
Barr reflected on her time in television in an article for Vulture, commenting briefly on the

01:41.520 --> 01:47.360
possibility of a Roseanne reboot. Hollywood hates labor, and hates shows about labor worse than any

01:47.360 --> 01:53.200
other thing, and that's why you won't be seeing another Roseanne anytime soon. Instead, all over

01:53.200 --> 01:59.680
the tube, you'll find enterprising, over-medicated, painted-up capitalist whores claiming to be housewives.

01:59.680 --> 02:05.520
But I'm not bitter. While that might make her sound like a darling Anne Cap, she isn't quite the ally

02:05.520 --> 02:10.240
most on the left would be looking for. Here's some comments she had about the trans community.

02:10.240 --> 02:15.120
She also spoke to a number of right-wing conspiracy theories, from Pizzagate to the supposedly

02:15.120 --> 02:21.280
suspicious murder of Seth Rich. And of course, her support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election

02:21.280 --> 02:27.200
is well-documented. Many of these noxious tweets have since been deleted. Sarah Gilbert, who played

02:27.200 --> 02:32.880
Darlene, had some success of her own by creating the TV daytime talk show The Talk for CBS.

02:32.880 --> 02:36.320
It was on that show she had a brief reunion with John Goodman.

02:36.320 --> 02:42.720
Um, god, I don't know how to say this. I'm a talk show host.

02:44.000 --> 02:48.480
It was this short clip that would eventually lead to the series being revived on ABC for a 10th

02:48.480 --> 02:54.640
season, 20 years later. The cast was reunited, and it seemed like all of America was ready to

02:54.640 --> 03:01.920
forgive, forget, or in some cases celebrate Roseanne's rather curious political leanings,

03:01.920 --> 03:07.440
all in an effort to warmly welcome the return of one of the biggest sitcoms of the 90s.

03:07.440 --> 03:12.320
For the previous nine seasons, I've been trying to find some sort of value or meaning that a viewer

03:12.320 --> 03:18.080
can discover within them. Season 10 takes the characters and context of those seasons and brings

03:18.080 --> 03:22.800
them all the way into the present. But does this show exist carrying the baggage of the past,

03:22.800 --> 03:26.960
or does that baggage make it something more than a show starting from scratch,

03:26.960 --> 03:30.320
and can it escape the shadow of its titular star, Roseanne?

03:30.320 --> 03:48.400
In the first episode of season 10, 20 years to life, we are reintroduced to most of the familiar

03:48.400 --> 03:53.600
faces from the show. Dan and Roseanne are in old age, still struggling to get by, Becky works as

03:53.600 --> 03:58.560
a waitress for a Mexican restaurant, Darlene, after losing her job in Chicago, is forced to

03:58.560 --> 04:03.360
move back in with her parents, now a single mother with two kids, Harris and Mark. DJ,

04:03.360 --> 04:07.520
a veteran home from fighting in the Middle East, struggles to pay his bills and raise his daughter

04:07.520 --> 04:13.920
Mary. His wife, Gina, is still deployed in Syria. And Jackie is still single, trying to find someone

04:13.920 --> 04:18.560
to love her. A few serious regulars have cameos throughout the season, updating us all on their

04:18.560 --> 04:22.560
whereabouts, but in most cases they seem to be right where we left them 20 years ago, struggling

04:22.560 --> 04:27.440
to survive in a town where the rules seem written for people who aren't them, likely informed by

04:27.440 --> 04:31.440
Roseanne Barr's political profile. The first episode runs into the political commentaries

04:31.440 --> 04:36.720
whether Jackie and Roseanne haven't been speaking since the 2016 election that put Donald Trump into

04:36.720 --> 04:42.320
the White House. As you may have noticed, in that nearly one hour and 20 minutes I spent rambling

04:42.320 --> 04:46.880
about the first nine seasons, I never mentioned the characters delving into partisan politics,

04:46.880 --> 04:52.480
largely because they didn't. Taken from an interview in 1992, Barr told the LA Times that

04:52.480 --> 04:56.720
when it comes to the politics of the Conner family, they're somewhere in the middle of it all,

04:56.720 --> 05:01.600
not knowing what anything stands for anymore. So really, what they do is go to work and come

05:01.600 --> 05:06.720
to be with their family and try to make do. Even the Conners aren't spared the burden of partisanship

05:06.720 --> 05:11.920
in 2018, and this partisanship was what brought the show a lot of attention. Its first episode was

05:11.920 --> 05:16.720
a breakout success, and it seemed like Roseanne was set for another run at the top of primetime,

05:16.720 --> 05:23.440
or might have been if 2018 was as tolerant of those stars' eccentricities as the 1990s have been.

05:23.440 --> 05:28.960
The first thing I noticed in this first episode of Roseanne's tenth season is the passage of time,

05:28.960 --> 05:34.000
not just the faces of the actors, but the very production of the show. Multi-camera sitcoms

05:34.000 --> 05:39.280
filmed in front of a live studio audience are increasingly rare, most opt for the single-camera

05:39.280 --> 05:43.520
style you would see on a drama series. Roseanne stays true to its roots, though, with a loving

05:43.520 --> 05:47.920
recreation of all the sights of the old Conner home. It's as though these characters have been

05:47.920 --> 05:53.280
living this endless loop of their hopeless sitcom lives for the past 20 years. But the subtext

05:53.280 --> 05:57.920
here isn't that the Conners' lives are still sorted, but rather the lives of the working class

05:57.920 --> 06:02.320
are still desperate. We can smile nostalgically at how nothing has changed for the Conners,

06:02.320 --> 06:06.080
but applying the same truth to the people they represent is heartbreaking.

06:06.800 --> 06:11.840
Although now in old age, a new host of problems present themselves, like a lack of healthcare.

06:23.280 --> 06:33.120
There are also strange new problems that aren't really problems, such as not really

06:33.120 --> 06:51.760
understanding a non-gender conforming grandson. The generational split from the earlier seasons

06:51.760 --> 06:55.600
is even more pronounced, and with a third generation in the mix, more than ever we get

06:55.600 --> 07:18.800
a sense of how old and out of date Roseanne and Dan are. Things are brought into sharper focus when

07:18.800 --> 07:24.880
we find out Becky, desperate for cash, is going to be a surrogate for, well, the other Becky,

07:24.880 --> 07:31.360
although she's playing a new character, Andrea, in this season. The payment of $50,000 is too much

07:31.360 --> 07:36.000
for Becky to ignore, and we get an interesting callback to an earlier episode, where a woman's

07:36.000 --> 07:40.240
body is her choice, regardless of, in this case, what her father may think.

07:48.800 --> 08:09.440
It's a reminder of how, even though the Conners are older and less in step with modern discourse,

08:09.440 --> 08:14.880
they aren't completely hopeless. That said, the show genuinely seems to be asking the question

08:14.880 --> 08:20.400
if there's anything they can still say that's of value. Dan's frustration is symbolic of that,

08:20.400 --> 08:25.760
that the old relic he is no longer has a say in how the world works. To be honest, he never had

08:25.760 --> 08:30.320
much of a say in the old show, but he did carry weight and authority, as father typically does.

08:31.040 --> 08:36.960
Roseanne's acquiescence was also huge, letting Becky decide for herself, even if later on she

08:36.960 --> 08:41.520
admitted she really didn't want her to be a surrogate. Just watching the show feels like

08:41.520 --> 08:46.160
slipping back in time, but what part do we want to go back to? And more importantly, how can

08:46.160 --> 08:51.200
revisiting the past help us in the present? Let's do a quick comparison between season 10 and an

08:51.200 --> 08:56.400
episode from the original run of the series. Back in season 3, the episode Trick or Treat includes

08:56.400 --> 09:01.680
some interesting gender bedding, as DJ wants to dress as a witch for Halloween, and Roseanne

09:01.680 --> 09:05.360
dresses up as a man. We do get her a few revealing lines from Dan.

09:11.520 --> 09:37.280
And this is pretty much par for the course when it comes to Dan's anxiety about his son's

09:37.280 --> 09:44.480
masculinity. He's worried about it. That said, they do resolve it nicely by the end of the show.

09:51.520 --> 09:56.240
But overall, particularly the scenes with Roseanne, this episode feels like a missed

09:56.240 --> 10:01.120
opportunity. We get a sampling of the violence and toxic masculinity, but it's hidden behind

10:01.120 --> 10:06.560
far too many cheap jokes about men's bathroom habits. Season 10's take on the issue of not

10:06.560 --> 10:12.800
being gender conforming is different. In Dress to Impress, Mark's dressing up in traditionally

10:12.800 --> 10:18.560
female clothing makes Dan and Roseanne concerned. We have a surprisingly sweet scene between

10:18.560 --> 10:25.280
grandmother and grandson. Okay, I'm gonna ask you something kind of adult, but you're growing up and

10:25.280 --> 10:34.560
I think you can handle it. Do you feel like you're a boy or a girl? A boy? Well, you answered that

10:34.560 --> 10:42.560
pretty quick. I thought it was going to be more complicated. So what's up with the girl's clothes?

10:43.200 --> 10:47.120
This just feels like me. I like colors that pop. It's more creative.

10:49.760 --> 10:56.320
Well, your mom's creative, so I get that, but here's the thing. You've got to pick your fights

10:56.320 --> 11:05.120
in life. How important is this to you? It's important. Okay. Well, you know it's going to

11:05.120 --> 11:15.520
be rough on you at school, right? But we'll back you up. Dan's advice of giving Mark a knife does

11:15.520 --> 11:20.960
less good. So you admit it. You were trying to make it more masculine. When did masculine become

11:20.960 --> 11:27.680
a dirty word? And no, I'm not. I'm scared for him. If I don't get what's going on, what do you

11:27.680 --> 11:32.240
think a classroom full of 10 year olds from Lanford is going to do? But Mark proves surprisingly

11:32.240 --> 11:38.160
resilient. But if things get rough, I put pants and a t-shirt in your backpack and you know what?

11:38.160 --> 11:46.160
You're still going to be you. No, I won't. I'm fine, Mom. Well, what if that kid teases you again or

11:46.160 --> 11:52.320
pushes you down or something? He'll get tired of it eventually. I like my clothes. In some ways,

11:52.320 --> 11:57.200
it's refreshing to see a kid who can so effectively stand up for himself. That said,

11:57.920 --> 12:03.600
what precisely does Mark need from his grandparents? He has support from his mother and proves how

12:03.600 --> 12:07.840
strong he already is. Note that some of that toughness is a Connor trait inherited from his

12:07.840 --> 12:12.160
grandparents, but a trait that doesn't need shaping the way it needed shaping in Becky,

12:12.160 --> 12:16.400
Darlene, and DJ. If anything, the show is addressing the older people in the audience,

12:16.400 --> 12:21.680
telling them that non-gender conformity is okay and the real problem is the kids who tease Mark.

12:21.680 --> 12:26.480
In other words, the social pressure. The original series never escaped the gender binary,

12:26.480 --> 12:31.040
and season 10 doesn't quite get away from that either. That said, it does at least delve into

12:31.040 --> 12:35.440
the idea that gender norms are performative and lets a child explore those boundaries in a way

12:35.440 --> 12:40.240
where it isn't him learning his place in the world, but his world learning how to accept him.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.320
In the original run of the series, though, being non-gender conforming is a part of a holiday

12:44.320 --> 12:48.560
tradition. When it comes to wearing those non-gender conforming clothes every day,

12:48.560 --> 12:53.120
that's a tougher bridge to cross for Roseanne and Dan. I think the progression seen in these

12:53.120 --> 12:58.080
episodes is pretty neat. It shows how society can take steps forward quicker than people,

12:58.080 --> 13:02.080
and that isn't always the bad thing. While it doesn't make Roseanne and Dan monsters for

13:02.080 --> 13:06.000
falling behind the times, it definitely shows us that they're out of touch with what their

13:06.000 --> 13:10.720
grandchildren need to be happy. It also doesn't completely discard their experiences as old

13:10.720 --> 13:15.120
fogeys. They knew Mark would be teased, and they wanted to help. They just didn't know how to do

13:15.120 --> 13:20.720
it. In Roseanne Gets the Chair, we get even more extreme parenting advice from Roseanne when Harris

13:20.720 --> 13:25.680
is shown to be completely walking all over Darlene. And this time, it's kinda messed up.

13:36.000 --> 14:04.720
Let's go back to the original run of the series for a moment. In the Season 6 episode,

14:04.720 --> 14:10.400
The Driver's Seat, this episode includes a plotline where DJ steals Roseanne's car

14:10.400 --> 14:15.600
and gets caught by the cops. Roseanne's reaction is pretty dark.

15:04.720 --> 15:13.440
I'm really sorry that I hit you, DJ. I was totally wrong. I never should have done that.

15:13.440 --> 15:15.680
I'm so mad at myself for doing it.

15:34.720 --> 15:41.440
Mad and, you know, kind of embarrassed. Wrong.

15:44.160 --> 15:51.120
Lots of way that I used to feel when I got hit. Who hit you?

15:53.600 --> 16:00.640
Your grandpa hit me. A lot. What'd you do wrong?

16:00.640 --> 16:06.720
I mean, I breathed or something. Do you hate him?

16:11.520 --> 16:19.360
Yes, sometimes. You know, because the worst thing was that, you know, he never,

16:19.360 --> 16:25.840
ever said he was sorry for any of it, you know. I don't want you to hit me,

16:25.840 --> 16:32.320
DJ. I'm really sorry that I hit you. No matter what, I'm never gonna hit you again, ever.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.760
No matter what I do? No matter what you do, ever.

16:37.840 --> 16:45.440
I'm sorry you got hit. I'm sorry you got hit, too. I mean, big sorry.

16:47.440 --> 16:52.000
Right now would be a great time to ask me for a new puppy's kind of sorry.

16:52.480 --> 16:58.720
This episode really demonstrated the cycle of abuse and how victims can still be capable of abuse

16:58.720 --> 17:03.760
themselves. There were several episodes that documented Roseanne Connor's abuse at the hands

17:03.760 --> 17:08.400
of her father that I didn't get to touch on in my first video, but it's an important bit of context

17:08.400 --> 17:14.080
that sadly gets lost in season 10. This season 10 revival of Roseanne supposedly has the old

17:14.080 --> 17:19.360
working-class ethics revived in it, but in this episode we see some real abuse of her granddaughter.

17:19.360 --> 17:23.840
Is this really the Roseanne Connor from earlier seasons, or is this the Trump supporting

17:23.840 --> 17:29.280
reimagining of what she was? This moment reminds me of the strange rebranding of Roseanne as a

17:29.280 --> 17:34.160
conservative hero. Sure, she was a dreadful person in the 90s, but unless she was full of shit with

17:34.160 --> 17:38.880
her critiques of how the government and society left the working class behind, she obviously

17:38.880 --> 17:43.760
wasn't a member of the right. The character of Roseanne was heartbroken when she hit DJ, but

17:43.760 --> 17:48.160
now she's willing to hold her granddaughter's head underwater, have the perceptions of the

17:48.160 --> 17:52.160
writers of Roseanne Barr being on the right colored their perspective of the character of

17:52.160 --> 17:56.560
Roseanne Connor. Well, people parent differently than they did in your day. Turns out a lot of

17:56.560 --> 18:02.720
what you did did not work, and some of it was against the law. Yeah, it's against the law

18:02.720 --> 18:08.560
because your generation made everything so PC. Instead of spanking them, you tell them to go

18:08.560 --> 18:14.240
over there and think about what they did wrong. You know what they're thinking? I can't believe

18:14.240 --> 18:20.480
this loser isn't spanking me. We get a conclusion to the Becky surrogate storyline when we tragically

18:20.480 --> 18:27.840
learn that Becky is too old to have children in Eggs Over Not Easy, which is just a cruel title

18:27.840 --> 18:33.520
to be honest. Even with interventions, I'd say you have less than a five percent chance of ever

18:33.520 --> 18:40.960
getting pregnant. I know you've both been looking forward to this, I'm sorry. It coalesces into a

18:40.960 --> 18:46.880
hard truth about Becky's life these past 20 years. I don't know if you can see yourself frozen in

18:46.880 --> 18:52.720
the same place since Mark died, but everybody else can. I wouldn't have changed anything.

18:54.320 --> 19:03.040
I can't have kids. You said you didn't want kids. I thought I had more time. Was 50 grand really

19:03.040 --> 19:07.200
going to change Becky's life forever? Probably would have gotten her a few years if she were

19:07.200 --> 19:12.080
lucky. Things don't magically get better when someone gives you a bit of extra money. What Becky

19:12.080 --> 19:17.360
really needs is a change to her life, a change to the world she lives in where she can find a way

19:17.360 --> 19:22.960
of surviving without having to be some sort of baby machine, a subtle bit of commentary about

19:22.960 --> 19:27.120
the role of women in our society and how their worth is determined based on whether or not they

19:27.120 --> 19:32.560
can squeeze out a baby. On the lighter side for a moment, this episode also reminds us that John

19:32.560 --> 19:37.600
Goodman is fantastic with physical comedy. Look at the expression on his face here.

20:02.560 --> 20:16.640
In Go Cubs, the Conners, Roseanne in particular, are confronted with Muslim neighbors,

20:16.640 --> 20:21.120
Samir and Fatima. It's here we get one of those episodes where the Conners are faced with their

20:21.120 --> 20:28.080
own bigotry, but in a way that's less subtle than previous episode. Roseanne seems especially racist.

20:28.080 --> 20:32.080
What if this is a sleeper cell full of terrorists getting ready to blow up our neighborhood?

20:32.160 --> 20:36.960
This is what people from Iraq and Taliban just stand do.

20:38.880 --> 20:43.040
They hide out in neighborhoods like Lanford. Don't you watch the news?

20:44.400 --> 20:48.480
Her opinion changes when she encounters her neighbor at a grocery store.

20:48.480 --> 20:56.880
It says insufficient funds. You're $30 short. Um, I didn't know. Sorry, maybe the American

20:56.880 --> 21:05.040
taxpayers forgot to fill it up last week. Excuse me? I'm an American taxpayer sometimes.

21:06.400 --> 21:13.280
Put it on my EBT card. You don't need to do that. Well, we're stealing your cable,

21:13.280 --> 21:19.120
so this probably makes us even. Maybe you can help her carry the groceries out to her camel too.

21:19.120 --> 21:32.400
Roseanne's growth happens less in a moment of self-reflection and more in a moment of empathy

21:32.400 --> 21:37.040
when she sees what bigotry looks like. Unlike the complicated and messy bigotry of the earlier

21:37.040 --> 21:43.120
seasons, in episodes like White Man Can't Kiss, this story is straightforward. Bigotry like this

21:43.120 --> 21:47.120
certainly exists, and there's certainly no harm in showing Roseanne changing her way when she

21:47.120 --> 21:52.000
observes it, but in some ways this feels more old-fashioned than the Roseanne episodes of 20

21:52.000 --> 21:56.400
years earlier, the few that dared to tackle the issue to begin with. Some interesting behind the

21:56.400 --> 22:01.040
scenes commentary for this episode is that the idea of giving Roseanne Connor Muslim neighbors

22:01.040 --> 22:05.920
apparently came from Barr herself. On the other hand, one of the former writers of the Roseanne

22:05.920 --> 22:12.800
series speaking anonymously to Buzzfeed said, I don't recognize that character. I believe the

22:12.800 --> 22:18.560
original character would have said, who cares about having Muslim neighbors? And now she's

22:18.560 --> 22:23.920
saying she does care. This might be another case of Roseanne Barr's Trump support being projected

22:23.920 --> 22:29.200
onto the character of Roseanne Connor. As a sharper point of comparison, the third season

22:29.200 --> 22:33.600
brought us the Bowman's wealthy neighbors who also moved in across the street from the Connors.

22:33.840 --> 22:36.320
Your living room reminds me of ours.

22:38.720 --> 22:43.200
Well, I'm not quite finished with it yet. The tension between Roseanne and Kathy Bowman is

22:43.200 --> 22:48.640
immediate, as Kathy is incapable of accepting the living conditions of her working-class neighborhood.

22:48.640 --> 22:53.840
This episode, like other episodes that include the Bowman's, highlight the class differences that

22:53.840 --> 22:58.720
animate what the series was about. It's no coincidence that the hostility to the Connors

22:58.720 --> 23:03.680
come from right outside their home, as if the society right outside their doors against them,

23:03.680 --> 23:09.200
and the only comfort they can have is within their happy little home. Well, happy being a relative

23:09.200 --> 23:14.560
term. In season 10, the roles have been reversed. The Connor household is where the hostility is

23:14.560 --> 23:19.200
coming from, and it takes the shape of prejudice towards their neighbors based on their ethnicity.

23:20.400 --> 23:25.280
In some ways, this feels like a microcosm of what the original nine seasons of the series missed.

23:25.280 --> 23:30.320
It was very good at pointing out the snobbery of the upper class, a la Kathy Bowman, but when it

23:30.320 --> 23:35.360
came to the racial bigotry of the Connors, it was relegated to a handful of episodes, and often

23:35.360 --> 23:39.920
struggled to really grasp where the other side was coming from. In many ways, it highlights how

23:39.920 --> 23:44.720
a white working-class family is a great setting for discussions about class, but less so for ones

23:44.720 --> 23:59.520
about race. So, actually, Roseanne. I'm going to have to disagree on that one. The eighth episode,

23:59.520 --> 24:04.320
Netflix and Pill, delves into Roseanne's pain pill addiction. She had been suffering a bad

24:04.320 --> 24:08.400
knee all season, and this episode reveals she had been hiding pills all over the house.

24:14.800 --> 24:19.040
The champagne on the Vicodin should say, do not take it with label.

24:21.920 --> 24:24.320
But the good news is, my knees are gone.

24:26.640 --> 24:30.960
How did you possibly have taken more Vicodin? I didn't even get the prescription yet.

24:30.960 --> 24:36.160
Well, you better get on it, because my secret bottles are running low.

24:38.240 --> 24:42.400
You don't have any idea how bad it hurts. Yeah, I do. I get a bad back.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.880
And when your back goes out, you lay on the couch for two weeks, and I wait on you hand and foot.

24:46.880 --> 24:51.760
You know what happens when my knee hurts? I do the cleaning, the shopping, the cooking.

24:51.760 --> 24:56.320
Fine, I'll do all that. Just show me where the water bucket is and the sponge on the stick thingy.

24:57.280 --> 25:01.680
Roseanne's addiction is a product of their poverty, not being able to afford knee surgery.

25:01.680 --> 25:05.920
It's a portrait of addiction that also doesn't blame the addict, and shows how people are driven

25:05.920 --> 25:10.480
into it not because of loose morals, but desperation. It sums up what the show has

25:10.480 --> 25:14.640
always tried to be about, whether we relate to the Conners directly or we're getting a glimpse

25:14.640 --> 25:19.360
of the people we may have looked down on. Either way, we're confronted with people in shitty

25:19.360 --> 25:24.400
situations that aren't of their own making. They're people making do as best they can with what

25:24.400 --> 25:30.160
they've got. In the final episode of season 10, and consequently of Roseanne, knee deep,

25:30.160 --> 25:35.360
a flood hits Lanford and the cost of repairing the foundation drove Dan to hire illegal immigrants

25:35.360 --> 25:40.800
in an effort to win a bid on a drywall job, leaving his longtime friend Chuck out in the cold.

26:05.600 --> 26:11.200
What do you want me to do? I got three extra mouths to feed since Darlene moved back in.

26:12.240 --> 26:16.320
Roseanne started popping pills because we didn't have the money to fix her knee,

26:16.320 --> 26:23.840
and now I got 20 grand of water damage. I spent my whole life hanging on by my fingertips telling

26:23.840 --> 26:29.520
everybody not to worry that I was going to make it okay because that's my job. Well, now I can't

26:29.520 --> 26:36.160
promise that anymore. So yeah, it makes me sick, but I'm going to do whatever I have to do to take

26:36.160 --> 26:43.040
care of my family because I'm old, I'm tired, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold on.

26:45.680 --> 26:53.840
Well, I'm old too, and I'm tired, and now I'm unemployed. I always told you, if I'm eating,

26:53.840 --> 27:00.160
you're eating. I'm not eating. As the family is pushed closer to financial ruin, they're saved

27:00.160 --> 27:05.200
when the president declares a state of emergency, which means a FEMA program that will help cover

27:05.200 --> 27:12.000
the damages. You have young children rooting for other people's misery. He just declared it!

27:18.240 --> 27:22.560
With that problem mostly solved, Roseanne can finally go under the knife for knee surgery,

27:22.560 --> 27:27.360
and the Connors get the chance to enjoy a meal together, their last meal, at least under the

27:27.360 --> 27:33.600
banner of Roseanne. The series ends in a low-key way, almost as if they were expected another

27:33.600 --> 27:38.480
season. A broken-off series can feel incomplete, but does Roseanne's story really feel like it's

27:38.480 --> 27:44.880
missing pages? She had 10 seasons of stories, even with an abbreviated tenth. Old problems are joined

27:44.880 --> 27:50.560
by new ones, and anything that's solved never lasts. The Connors are in some ways the victims

27:50.560 --> 27:56.240
of the TV culture Roseanne parodied in its original run. They can never change, or else

27:56.240 --> 28:01.520
we'd stop caring about them. It's also what makes them feel real, the same way we rarely ascend from

28:01.520 --> 28:06.880
our own circumstances. Working class stays working class, and the series shows that it's not because

28:06.880 --> 28:11.200
they're shitty people, but they're in a society that doesn't really give a shit about them.

28:11.920 --> 28:16.560
The sudden end of the series came on May 29th when Roseanne Barr made a racist comment about

28:16.640 --> 28:22.320
one of President Obama's senior advisors, Valerie Jarrett. The Roseanne show was cancelled hours

28:22.320 --> 28:42.960
later. Her defense for her actions was… well… Following this video, the next day she released

28:42.960 --> 28:47.680
an official statement, filmed in the same setting with a more tranquil Roseanne. In longer

28:47.680 --> 28:52.080
interviews she would place the blame more squarely on her ambient usage influencing her.

28:52.080 --> 29:14.080
I'm not sure if she said the same for the many other incendiary tweets she's made over the years.

29:14.080 --> 29:19.600
Barr's castmates immediately turned on her as one would if someone tweeted out a racist insult.

29:19.600 --> 29:24.000
With that tweet, Roseanne was able to do something very special for one of the questions I asked at

29:24.000 --> 29:29.200
the beginning of this video. Can we have a socially conscious show like Roseanne, but without

29:29.200 --> 29:36.320
Roseanne Barr herself? The answer so far is… kind of. And it comes in the form of The Conners.

29:36.320 --> 29:49.760
In the months that followed Barr's exit, rumors swirled about a new show focusing on Darlene

29:49.760 --> 29:54.560
Connor. Darlene's importance in higher profile in season 10 seemed to set the stage quite nicely,

29:54.560 --> 30:00.240
but ultimately what we got was the more neutral title of The Conners, and a shared focus on Darlene

30:00.240 --> 30:05.920
and Dan. In the first episode, Keep on Trucking premiered on October 16th. It picked up right

30:05.920 --> 30:10.720
where last season left off, only this time following the sudden death of Roseanne Connor.

30:35.920 --> 30:46.480
Roseanne's death is used to immediately spring towards the social issue that had been in the

30:46.480 --> 30:51.680
background of season 10, and that was covered briefly in episode 8 of that season, Roseanne's

30:51.680 --> 30:57.280
addiction to pain pills. If you'll remember that episode, Roseanne's problem wasn't brought about

30:57.280 --> 31:04.320
by her moral degeneracy or any sort of personal issue, but rather her character's lack of access

31:04.320 --> 31:09.600
to proper medical care that she couldn't afford knee surgery when she desperately needed it.

31:09.600 --> 31:14.880
That addiction was created in an effort to cope with a real physical problem that could have been

31:14.880 --> 31:20.000
addressed with proper medical care. In this episode of The Conners, it highlights the underground pill

31:20.000 --> 31:25.120
community in Lanford, and most strikingly how these people aren't horrible drug dealers, but

31:25.120 --> 31:31.040
people trying to help each other survive. Nobody can afford their meds. We all help each other. When

31:32.240 --> 31:38.480
Sally Benson needed Lipitor for her husband's cholesterol, they got some from Maria Ramirez,

31:38.480 --> 31:43.360
and they gave her the anxiety meds. She needed for some because they dropped her insurance.

31:44.480 --> 31:53.120
Rosie needed painkillers. I had some, so I gave them to her. So you're part of a neighborhood

31:53.120 --> 31:59.360
drug ring. Congratulations to you. You know what, Dan? You can judge, but Roseanne called me.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.040
She told me that her knee wasn't healing up fast enough, and I was the only person she could turn

32:05.040 --> 32:09.840
to. She said that she needed those pain pills to get back to work because you guys were running

32:09.840 --> 32:14.640
out of money. It's important to acknowledge that access to care isn't a perfect safeguard against

32:14.640 --> 32:19.680
addiction, as it is possible for doctors to overprescribe, but a doctor is still a better source

32:19.680 --> 32:24.080
of medication than some nice lady who lives down the street. More broadly for this show, it

32:24.080 --> 32:29.440
demonstrates what the Connors can be without Roseanne by underscoring what the original show was at its

32:29.440 --> 32:34.560
best. The character of Roseanne is the premise upon which real issues affecting working-class

32:34.560 --> 32:39.120
people can be discussed. Whether she's alive or dead matters less than the fact that she's a

32:39.120 --> 32:44.320
catalyst for this discussion to begin. A dead character can't direct conversations in a show,

32:44.320 --> 32:48.640
so her dying kind of ends that. It does open the door for the rest of the family to center

32:48.640 --> 32:53.520
those discussions around themselves and the problems that they face, all while keeping their

32:53.520 --> 33:17.200
trademark sense of humor. One thing season 10 of Roseanne made a nominal attempt to do was

33:17.200 --> 33:22.640
offer a fig leaf to right-wing audience members, and the first season of The Connors does something

33:22.640 --> 33:28.000
similar. In the third episode, There Won't Be Blood, Halloween, a favorite holiday in the

33:28.000 --> 33:32.720
Connor household, sets the stage for a small controversy about Halloween costumes.

33:47.200 --> 33:58.720
Darlene's son Mark is soon refused entry into a school carnival where he dresses as Frida Kahlo.

34:17.200 --> 34:44.880
This is the red meat episode, a tip of the hat to an argument you more often hear from the right

34:44.880 --> 34:50.400
that isn't completely without merit, and an example of a show trying to be balanced. From

34:50.400 --> 34:55.440
a leftist perspective, there is still value in this episode. Much like in the second episode of

34:55.440 --> 35:00.720
season 10 of Roseanne, the Mark-centric episode focuses on his wardrobe, something you certainly

35:00.720 --> 35:05.520
don't see reflected in stories about young boys on TV. Although this could be framed as strictly

35:05.520 --> 35:10.320
an episode for conservatives to reel about political correctness affecting Halloween costumes,

35:10.320 --> 35:13.840
I would rather look at how it's framing the discussion in a way that would support a young

35:13.840 --> 35:17.840
boy's decision to dress in something non-traditional male. This is the sort of

35:17.840 --> 35:23.680
compromise that I think can leave both sides happy. Fancy that. This episode also introduces

35:23.680 --> 35:26.960
us to Jackie's new boyfriend, Peter, played by Matthew Broderick.

35:26.960 --> 35:48.640
One big change for this series is Dan's new role as the voice of reason. In the Roseanne show,

35:48.640 --> 35:53.040
his voice was paired with Roseanne's, so he didn't have quite the patriarchal role that has fallen

35:53.040 --> 35:58.240
so heavily on him in this series. In the fifth episode, Miracles, we can see that new role after

35:58.240 --> 36:21.920
Becky announces she's pregnant and plans on raising the child alone. This episode also introduces love

36:21.920 --> 36:27.280
interests for both Becky and Darlene. Respectively, they are Emilio, played by René Rosado,

36:31.760 --> 36:43.200
and Ben, played by J.R. Ferguson. This episode highlights growing diversity within the series.

36:43.200 --> 36:47.120
Emilio is going to be a bigger force than you might expect, and his role has a political

36:47.200 --> 36:51.760
dimension that makes perfect sense. Previous incarnation of the show often did shy away from

36:51.760 --> 36:57.040
racial issues, but this one isn't. That seems like an improvement to me. An important realization that

36:57.040 --> 37:00.800
when talking about the working class in the United States, you shouldn't leave out the Hispanic

37:00.800 --> 37:06.000
population and the unique problems they face. The romance between Ben and Darlene is cute,

37:06.000 --> 37:10.480
and it shows that what appeals to the bulldozer personality of a strong female character like

37:10.480 --> 37:16.240
Darlene isn't a pushover like David or a strong man to dominate her, but a man that's her match.

37:17.120 --> 37:22.320
I would love the three shrimp tacos. Pick something else. A lot of shrimp is peeled

37:22.320 --> 37:26.400
by Thai kids forced into slave labor, so you think you're eating scampi, but really you're

37:26.400 --> 37:32.560
exploiting children. I got an idea. What if I just had one small shrimp taco and I feel bad about it?

37:34.640 --> 37:40.640
Have the chile relleno. They're really good here. They're vegan. Yeah, I really like those. No, you will.

37:42.800 --> 37:47.040
Well, I think I speak for everyone in the internet department when I say I think we can go out

37:47.040 --> 37:52.480
for dinner. What do you like? Uh, Chinese. I could go for some shrimp fried rice.

37:59.600 --> 38:04.480
You probably, you probably don't know this. Uh, most of the shrimp we eat isn't processed

38:04.480 --> 38:12.480
ethically, so you don't want to get that. Oh, you're confused. You thought I was a child when

38:12.480 --> 38:22.000
I'm actually a grown-ass adult. Yeah, I didn't mean to push. That's not who I am. Oh, great.

38:23.440 --> 38:28.320
Ben is her boss, though she does get a promotion within the first episode and is clearly on her

38:28.320 --> 38:32.560
way up to being his equal, but the fact that he's still her boss says something about economic

38:32.560 --> 38:38.080
disparity. Ben obviously isn't rich, but he seems to be a step ahead of Darlene in the world. The

38:38.160 --> 38:43.520
wage gap exists in all classes, even the working class. This can be viewed through that lens,

38:43.520 --> 38:48.560
rather than the gender dynamics of a man having power over a woman. It isn't trying to reinforce

38:48.560 --> 38:54.320
the patriarchy. It's about how capitalism uses the patriarchy to present supposedly natural power

38:54.320 --> 38:58.800
dynamics between men and women. Women's work is less valuable, and look at that, the man is the

38:58.800 --> 39:03.440
boss. Continuing on that theme of working class issues that don't just affect white people,

39:03.440 --> 39:08.880
in episode 10, Don't Shoot the Piano Teacher, we learn specifically that Emilio is an illegal

39:08.880 --> 39:14.160
immigrant. Is he here illegally? Well, who cares if he's illegal? Who cares if he's a busboy?

39:14.160 --> 39:17.920
A lot of people with difficult beginnings have risen above their station in life,

39:17.920 --> 39:22.800
Dan. I mean, nobody in our family, but I've read about it. It's pretty inspirational when it

39:22.800 --> 39:31.440
happens. And we see Dan evolve on the subject. Look, I gotta be honest with you. I don't like

39:31.440 --> 39:36.960
the way you got here. You broke the law and you could be putting me in a bad situation,

39:36.960 --> 39:44.320
but I want to help my daughter, so I have to help you. I understand. Dan's position on hiring

39:44.320 --> 39:48.800
undocumented immigrants is less of a difficult question when it comes to helping his daughter.

39:48.800 --> 39:54.000
Dan also realizes something. Rather than the hideous drug dealer caricature presented by,

39:54.000 --> 39:59.040
say, the president of the United States, Emilio is a hardworking guy who's come to the United States

39:59.040 --> 40:04.160
to make a better life for himself. Dan doesn't have to like the way Emilio entered the country,

40:04.160 --> 40:07.600
but he also can't deny that his family's lives would be better if he was there.

40:08.640 --> 40:13.040
Becky's fear of Emilio being deported is a callback to her fear of being left behind again,

40:13.040 --> 40:18.000
the same way Mark left her behind when he died. While the deportation angle doesn't enter into

40:18.000 --> 40:22.400
her mind in a racist context, it does color her relationship with him. How can she think of

40:22.400 --> 40:26.800
building a life with him, even if he says he'll be around, when he might be gone the next day?

40:26.800 --> 40:31.200
Why are you pushing him into my life? Because you're being stubborn and stupid. I'm sorry. I'm

40:31.200 --> 40:38.880
a life coach. You're being overly rooted and intelligent adjacent. What is your problem?

40:38.880 --> 40:44.320
You know what my problem is? I've been doing fine. So why should I start depending on somebody who

40:44.320 --> 40:49.040
might not be here when I need him? Living in fear prevents undocumented immigrants from reaching a

40:49.040 --> 40:54.720
greater potential. The season finale, we continue to truck ends with a few major bombshells. Jackie

40:54.720 --> 40:59.120
breaks up with her boyfriend, Peter, after she finds out he's been cheating on her.

40:59.120 --> 41:04.240
I'm with you and not her. A stupid affair doesn't mean I love you any less.

41:04.800 --> 41:09.040
Don't throw what we have away by being so narrow-minded and provincial.

41:09.040 --> 41:12.640
Don't play your mind games with me. This isn't my fault.

41:13.280 --> 41:14.160
Isn't it Jackie?

41:16.800 --> 41:19.760
Don't let your insecurity drive away another man.

41:20.720 --> 41:26.880
Oh my god. Dan told me you were taking advantage of me and I didn't listen because I was weak.

41:26.880 --> 41:27.600
You're not weak.

41:28.640 --> 41:31.040
Well, not anymore. I'm not.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.840
Oh, ow. Ow, ow. That hurt.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.080
Good. Well, then that means I'm doing it right.

41:36.080 --> 41:40.560
This leads Jackie to a bit of a breakdown, and it really highlights what the first season has been

41:40.560 --> 41:45.920
about, and that's loss. Dealing with the loss of Roseanne and trying to organize their lives

41:46.080 --> 41:51.360
around the gaping hole her absence has created. In many ways, the show itself is still struggling

41:51.360 --> 41:55.680
to fill that missing role of Roseanne Connor. To get those characters back to a place where they

41:55.680 --> 42:00.880
could be happy, Jackie's breakdown at the end is the sad realization that they can never go back.

42:00.880 --> 42:02.640
They'll never be happy the way they used to be.

42:03.120 --> 42:12.080
Me and my sister. We owned the place. We called it the lunchbox, and it was the last place I was

42:12.080 --> 42:17.600
happy. It's entirely possible things will change in future seasons, and it seems to be building in

42:17.600 --> 42:22.560
that direction, but it really demonstrates how families just don't bounce back from a trauma.

42:22.560 --> 42:26.800
The working class vibe is present, but it's understated compared to the earlier incarnation

42:26.800 --> 42:31.360
of the show, and its plays are more personal intersectional stories, touching on the Hispanic

42:31.360 --> 42:33.360
working class experience in Emilio.

43:01.600 --> 43:02.800
It's Emilio, right?

43:06.080 --> 43:10.160
Taking me to Tejas, and then turning me over to authorities in Juarez,

43:11.120 --> 43:15.520
I will find a way back to you and our baby after a short time in Chihuahua.

43:17.440 --> 43:19.360
In the city, no big dog.

43:20.800 --> 43:25.120
Characters of color are a welcome addition, and generally add new dimensions to the show,

43:25.120 --> 43:29.440
though there hasn't been much racial commentary with Gina and Mary. It also would have been nice

43:29.440 --> 43:33.360
to see something more of Gina outside of her intense religiosity.

43:33.360 --> 43:37.280
Well, you can gamble with your souls if you want, but my family's going to church.

43:37.280 --> 43:41.120
Aunt Darlene doesn't make Mark and Harris go, so why do I have to?

43:41.120 --> 43:42.240
Because I say so.

43:43.280 --> 43:44.800
These may be for future seasons.

43:45.440 --> 43:48.160
Gina Connor, would you stand and be recognized?

43:51.760 --> 43:54.000
Baby, people stop raising the roof in 2005.

43:54.160 --> 43:57.360
Can we have Roseanne without Roseanne?

43:58.160 --> 43:59.280
The answer is yes.

44:00.080 --> 44:00.960
Sort of.

44:00.960 --> 44:06.400
But it's not like so many of these stories couldn't or wouldn't be done in an 11th season of Roseanne.

44:06.400 --> 44:09.120
It feels more like the show is picking up where it left off,

44:09.120 --> 44:14.640
trying to cut off the toxic elements of the previous series, including Roseanne Barr herself.

44:14.640 --> 44:18.480
In some ways, the series didn't really need her to begin with,

44:18.480 --> 44:23.440
although in other ways it absolutely did because it was named for her and was a vehicle for her.

44:24.160 --> 44:29.840
One joke Roseanne Barr demanded to be put in the first episode of season 10 was about Hillary Clinton,

44:29.840 --> 44:33.280
to at least try to balance all the jokes about Donald Trump.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.720
Aunt Jackie thinks every girl should grow up and be president,

44:36.720 --> 44:39.200
even if they're a liar liar pantsuit on fire.

44:41.520 --> 44:46.400
And it makes me wonder what other things Roseanne would have demanded be included in future seasons.

44:46.400 --> 44:49.200
In many ways, she was a passenger in season 10.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.480
But season 11?

44:50.480 --> 44:51.200
Season 12?

44:51.760 --> 44:55.200
Considering how her influence grew throughout the first nine seasons,

44:55.200 --> 44:59.920
I think it's a decent assumption that her controlling personality would have bled to the fore

44:59.920 --> 45:03.040
and had a heavier influence on the direction of the show.

45:03.040 --> 45:07.040
It'll be interesting to see how the Conners grow in the future, without Roseanne's influence.

45:07.840 --> 45:12.560
That'll give it a freer hand to be what it wants, but what does it want to be?

45:12.560 --> 45:15.760
A show about the working class, in all its many shapes and forms,

45:15.760 --> 45:18.000
and how it struggles to get by in America today?

45:18.560 --> 45:23.360
That's possible, but not without more work to deliver on some of the early promises of its first season.

45:23.360 --> 45:27.280
It's a show that has a lot of baggage, but maybe that's what makes it feel all the more real,

45:27.280 --> 45:28.880
and maybe that's how it connects to people.

45:29.520 --> 45:34.800
In an interview she gave, Sarah Gilbert reflected on what the first season of The Conners accomplished.

45:34.800 --> 45:38.240
In this context, she's discussing the final episode of the first season.

45:38.240 --> 45:41.440
Some of the emotions of the premiere come up again in this episode.

45:41.440 --> 45:43.520
That's something that was really important to me.

45:43.520 --> 45:48.080
I didn't want to do a sitcom version of Lost where there's one very special episode,

45:48.080 --> 45:50.400
and then it's done and everybody moves on.

45:50.400 --> 45:54.560
This episode shows that emotional themes run through people's lives, and not just through a week.

45:55.120 --> 45:59.120
Perhaps most importantly, The Conners gave us a chance to enjoy a show that dramatized

45:59.120 --> 46:02.000
in the struggles of the working class in an entertaining way,

46:02.000 --> 46:05.920
just as the first nine seasons of Roseanne did, and just as the tenth season did.

46:06.560 --> 46:09.440
Though The Conners may never shake the ghost of its upbringing,

46:09.440 --> 46:11.840
it does point to a better future we can work towards,

46:11.840 --> 46:16.240
one that builds off the strengths of its past and hopefully leaves its weaknesses behind.

46:16.800 --> 46:21.120
One of its best strengths was highlighting the humor and joy that sustains people,

46:21.120 --> 46:23.360
even when the world seems to be forgetting them.

46:23.360 --> 46:26.720
While some may feel affinity in the hollow words of a conman,

46:26.720 --> 46:31.040
we can still learn about the struggles of these characters and perhaps even more from their

46:31.040 --> 46:36.480
failings, and hopefully it can create an awareness that this is a society not working for the working

46:36.480 --> 46:41.040
class, and from there, maybe the realization that it can be changed for the better.

46:41.040 --> 46:44.800
If Roseanne can get rid of its toxicity to become The Conners,

46:44.800 --> 46:48.160
why can't we be better and remove the toxicity from our own world?
