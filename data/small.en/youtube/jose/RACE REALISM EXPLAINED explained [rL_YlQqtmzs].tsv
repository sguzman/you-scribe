0	5000	Ah, so, it's come to this.
6000	12000	Call me naive, but there is nothing hateful in this so I don't get why this would be controversial.
12000	21000	Races exist, and anybody who denies that fact should be mocked and humiliated just like we do to flat earthers or creationists.
21000	30000	I don't give a shit if the reality of deferences between the races leads people to some unsavory conclusions.
30000	36000	The truth, however painful, can never be more dangerous than accepting lies.
36000	46000	My boy, JF. Wow, dudes, this video, mouthy, yo, and your editing, the mouth, incredible.
46000	49000	Race realism is common sense.
49000	54000	In before, the video gets flagged by triggered people who haven't actually watched it.
54000	61000	It isn't exactly shocking that science illiteracy is creating an opening for the bunk of race realism to slip in,
61000	72000	not knowing the basics of causality, lurking variables, or even evolution creates gaps for pseudoscience to slither in all through the lens of antisocial justice paranoia.
72000	80000	All those comments you heard earlier are from a specific video that I think is especially deceitful and manipulative.
80000	86000	Race realism explained from YouTuber, mouthyHitlerApologist.
86000	97000	It's narrated by Jean-Francois Guillip√©... I don't know, everyone just calls him JF, so I'm gonna go with that.
97000	105000	If this video were simply a basic educational primer on the basics of inheritable traits via Jean's, I'd have no problem with it.
105000	111000	I mean, people will watch it, probably forget about it 15 minutes later, and we'd all get on with our lives.
111000	123000	But what's really going on here is this video opens a door, a door that will lead you down a rather treacherous path into becoming a out-and-out racist.
123000	134000	Race is real as a social construct, but the biology of race is arbitrary. This video's attempt to tie the two together can only be described as... sinister.
134000	143000	Now, if you came here for the real deal on the science behind race, I highly recommend checking out YouTuber Concordance's videos on the subject.
143000	148000	They go into great detail, they're easily digestible, and you'll actually learn something useful.
149000	152000	And with that, let's get down in the mud.
152000	155000	First, we'll start off with the video's description of race.
155000	167000	Races are subdivisions of the human species into groups that differ in various observable and heritable characteristics, including but not limited to skin color and facial features.
167000	170000	Skin color and physical features.
171000	180000	Those heathens on the left have been saying race is only skin deep for decades, and this definition doesn't really go any further in that.
180000	182000	But will it hold throughout the video?
182000	188000	The differences, including but not limited to, has me a little suspicious.
188000	192000	And hey, here comes the next bit with this sinister line.
193000	205000	It's so nice that it was written out for us too. Very helpful.
205000	217000	The word reaffirm here is crucial. What this video is doing is confirming social conceptions of race, that is, confirming our stereotypes about race.
217000	225000	It's almost as if that aforementioned, including but not limited to, had some secret, darker purpose.
225000	229000	But maybe I'm being a little paranoid. Maybe there are no dog whistles here.
229000	240000	So this is the part I was going to show that clip from one of Mothi Buddha's streams about how he puts dog whistles in all of his videos, but apparently that's not online anymore.
240000	249000	And the only version of it I could find was this clip of streaming personality Destiny watching said clip.
249000	252000	So sorry about that.
270000	275000	At least one or two dog whistles in every video, and it's just a bit of language.
275000	285000	Let's keep going. We get a little video interlude of just stuff about racism and how race realism has nothing to do with that.
285000	297000	I just want to point out that the clips they used, they show some black guys beating up a white guy, a muscly white guy impressing some black guys, and a woman looking mentally distressed.
297000	303000	That's, wow, very subtle subtext there. Oh, and there's Yao Ming.
303000	313000	The video completely steps outside the bounds of commonly accepted biology and asserts that not all features that make up a race are a product of genetic transfer.
313000	318000	That is to say, race isn't purely a result of genes.
318000	328000	Contrary to popular belief, race realism does not require all features of a race to be inherited through DNA transmission between parents and offspring.
328000	336000	While it is believed that most characteristics of an individual, including skin color, hair color, and IQ, are heavily influenced by DNA,
336000	349000	it is possible that other features that distinguish races may be passed down through generations via other mechanisms, such as epigenetics and differences in the way parents educate their children.
349000	366000	Right, he calls them other mechanisms for transmitting race, so yeah, social factors shape race. Big surprise. It's almost as if they're socially constructed.
366000	374000	And just to look at these two mechanisms for a brief moment, I don't know what racial parenting means.
374000	383000	What is black parenting and what is white parenting? Is that a difference, or do all white parents parent the same way?
383000	391000	I'm sure there's a really stupid answer that they have for that, but, uh, is my response in advance.
391000	399000	And epigenetics, those who may not know what that means, it is a sciency sounding word, and it is actual science.
399000	405000	Epigenetics basically means changes to gene expression without actually changing someone's genes.
405000	413000	So here's a real world example. A person is born and they have a set of genes that will determine their height, say between 5'6 and 5'10.
413000	421000	If this person has a healthy diet through childhood and adolescence, they'll grow up to that 5'10 area of their possible height.
421000	424000	But if they're malnourished, they'll be closer to 5'6.
424000	433000	So the two variables at play here in this example are the range of heights, which is the genetic one, and the amount of food a person eats, which is the epigenetic.
434000	445000	This Guardian article by geneticist Adam Rutherford has a great analogy describing genes as sheet music, and epigenetics being the notation that affects how these notes are played.
445000	454000	Also, this article has some great information on how people use genetics as a backdoor to introduce nonsense pseudoscience, so definitely give it a read.
454000	464000	Okay, back to the garbage video. Did you notice the little dance it did moving away from mundane genetic expressions of skin features and traipsed into the world of social influences?
464000	472000	This is basically how race realism acts as a Trojan horse, and it uses the essentialist idea of race.
472000	478000	That is to say, race is an innate characteristic which divides us irrevocably.
478000	486000	You see, we've got these biological factors and social factors, which are inherent parts of our character.
486000	489000	Of course, that's silly if you think about it.
489000	498000	The idea is to get you, as a supposed white person, to identify yourself as a member of the white race.
498000	508000	And once you've bought into the notion of race realism and see yourself as a white person, you're ready to buy into the notion of an ethnostate.
508000	516000	And just to clarify a little bit, when I say white person, I don't mean, you know, your skin is white, because that may very well be true.
517000	529000	I mean, a white person who has white skin, but also ascribes to certain social beliefs and has white parenting, whatever that means.
529000	535000	I still don't know what that means. And you have white epigenetic traits.
535000	539000	I don't know what white epigenetic traits means either.
540000	547000	But hey, these are the other factors that supposedly make up this totally real thing of race.
547000	550000	Also, don't think I didn't notice this shit.
550000	555000	Skin color, hair color, and IQ are heavily influenced by DNA.
555000	559000	IQ, for fuck's sake. Oh, God.
559000	568000	If you're trying to talk about IQ in genes, I can only assume your intentions are impure, or at best, driven by ferocious ignorance.
568000	574000	For those that care, the short version is IQ is a product of our genes interacting with their environment.
574000	579000	Why these would map onto skin color? I don't know.
579000	584000	Facial features? Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why that would be the case.
584000	589000	There's some links in the description box that highlight the limitations of IQ.
589000	595000	But knowing the sort of people who push IQ myths around, you don't really care about that if you're listening to this.
595000	600000	And I know you'll cling to whatever garbage research keeps you happily deluded, so feel free to ignore those.
600000	606000	The rest of the video is just a brief summary and a tedious wrap-up montage, so that's about it.
606000	614000	The whole video pointed out some blase science and leaves the door open for a racist to walk in, so that's nice.
614000	616000	But I'm going to show you how that works, too.
616000	622000	So we're going to quickly go to JF's gal pal, Tara McCarthy, who walks through that opening created by RaceRealist.
622000	627000	Here she is talking on a show called Culture Report with some guy.
627000	637000	But it turns out that certain groups that consistently perform very poorly seem to have, from what all the science is saying today,
637000	649000	and from what the cutting-edge science in genome research is showing, is that they actually have limited intelligence genetically as a group.
649000	654000	Now, Tara here tries to talk about science and doesn't really get it.
654000	664000	She mentions the work of Jean-Philippe Rushton, a controversial Canadian professor whose work in the 80s was later on widely discredited.
664000	674000	Discredited, by the way, not by the Political Correctness Brigade, but other scientists in a variety of different fields, including Rushton's own of psychology.
674000	681000	He even debated famed Canadian geneticist David Suzuki in 1987, where this exchange happened.
704000	717000	Also Rushton said this during the debate.
734000	761000	Yeah, he says we should measure head sizes to predict test scores.
761000	771000	For those that don't know, it's phrenology. He's talking about phrenology as a completely discredited science as of the 19th century.
771000	779000	But you know what? It doesn't really matter if Tara is spreading bad science maliciously or if she just isn't bright enough to understand it.
779000	788000	The important thing here is that she's introducing us to the idea that science proves all the racist things we believed in the past, or as one video would put it.
788000	795000	Finding these clusters merely allowed scientists to reaffirm our conclusion that races are real in humans.
795000	800000	And that's the sleight of hand going on. This is how people are being moved down a pipeline.
800000	804000	You start off as someone who just wants the science about race, right? Just the facts.
804000	813000	So, you click on a video supposedly explaining race realism, and this video tells you that race is something that's scientifically stamped on you.
813000	823000	And then you're moved down this weird route where you're told you should see yourself as a white person, and then all of a sudden a person says, hey, white person, don't you want an ethnostate?
823000	831000	You know, the Chinese, they have theirs, and people in Africa have countries. Don't you as a white person want one?
831000	840000	And you think, huh, that sounds pretty good. You might think, hey, maybe there's something to this whole kicking the colored people out of our country thing.
840000	844000	Bam. You're now a racist.
844000	846000	Also, I just want to point out.
846000	863000	And another group that actually tends to have higher intelligence on average than whites is Japanese, South Korean, Chinese, and other people who have evolved in very harsh winter conditions as Europeans did.
864000	867000	What does that even mean, harsh winters?
867000	875000	I'm in the middle of a harsh winter right now, and I'm not really feeling any smarter living in a country where my face feels like it's constantly falling off when I go outside.
875000	879000	But hey, at least my descendants will be better at math because of that, right?
879000	885000	So basically, that's what's going on here. If you want to know the truth about race, I pointed you in the right direction.
885000	893000	And these people with their slick productions and fancy ways of trying to teach you some bullshit science are really just a big scheme.
893000	903000	Race realism isn't alternative science. It's a front for racism, the same way intelligent design was a front for creationism.
903000	911000	You know, I probably could have said that and most of you would have understood it, but hey, we learned together in this video.
911000	913000	Much love.
