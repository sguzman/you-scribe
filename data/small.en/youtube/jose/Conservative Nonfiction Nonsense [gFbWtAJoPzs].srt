1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
The world is great, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,760
Every year we have a deluge of conservative non-fiction containing the wisdom of pundits

3
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:16,880
and politicians alike. Many of these books pop up on bestseller lists, often under suspicious

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,680
circumstances, only to vanish a few weeks later. They're marketed as fan merchandise, to be

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,000
consumed, though not deeply understood, and they fit neatly into a publishing niche where

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,720
some conservative authors put away their long-standing grudges for a chance to make some money.

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,400
Here's one example. Candace Owens recently had her book reach the New York Times bestseller list.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,600
Here was her response on Twitter.

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,880
So excited about this. I'm officially a New York Times best-selling author.

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,280
High five, emojis. And five days later, she had this to say about the New York Times.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,880
It's time for our Department of Justice to begin looking into the New York Times.

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,400
Here's a fun fact. This is the tweet that Dave Rubin blocked me for.

13
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,800
I was really just posting two screencaps of tweets he had made, and they read,

14
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,040
The world controls tried to burn it, but failed miserably. Now a New York Times bestseller,

15
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:09,760
and number one in the political freedom category. And then a bunch of fire emojis.

16
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,720
The second tweet read,

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,760
Also, the dirty secret of the publishing world is that the New York Times bestseller list is almost

18
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,120
a total fabrication. It's not based on sales. They have a secret formula. Yes, really.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,400
It's nice to see these conservatives pretend, at least for a brief moment,

20
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,360
that the New York Times is reputable. So long as they can advertise the sales of their own book,

21
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,400
of course. These books have such catchy titles. What's so great about America?

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,200
The three C's that make America great. How to destroy America in three easy steps.

23
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,600
Death of a Nation. Adios America. Of the Izing. Stupid black man.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,320
In defense of internment. That's real.

25
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,720
Killing the mob. Killing Crazy Horse. Killing the SS. Killing England. Killing Patton. Killing

26
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,280
Kennedy. Killing Lincoln. Killing the rising sun. Killing Reagan. Killing Jesus. That doesn't work.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
Killing the killers. Finally, someone stop them.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,080
These are a tiny fraction of the many books published in the last two decades by conservative

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:11,040
pundits and politicians. Comparatively, you don't see as many by left-wing pundits. For example,

30
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,160
Bill O'Reilly alone has written more books than the entire MSNBC prime time lineup.

31
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,240
Many of these books have a recurring theme. That America is an exceptional nation,

32
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,200
filled with greatness. And there are forces, typically on the left, that want to destroy it.

33
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,120
I wanted to dig into some of these books, so I headed over to my local library and picked

34
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,720
out the first three books in the political science section by conservative authors.

35
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,520
The first was How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps by Ben Shapiro.

36
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,760
Second was Addicted to Outrage, How Thinking Like a Recovering Addict Can Heal the Country

37
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,680
by Glenn Beck. And the last was Don't Burn This Book, Thinking for Yourself in the Age of Unreason

38
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,600
by Dave Rubin. Let's dive into the knowledge, polemics, and philosophy hidden within the pages

39
00:02:53,600 --> 00:03:00,000
of these books. How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps is not a great title. The three things

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,400
discussed aren't really steps and they are definitely not easy, but before we get to them,

41
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,560
we have to go through some political theory invented by Ben Shapiro himself.

42
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,960
Shapiro splits Americans into two camps, those who want to hold America together,

43
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,480
or as he dubs them, unionists, and those who want to destroy America, who he calls

44
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,080
disintegrationists. Just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it? According to Shapiro, this isn't a

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,160
simple left-right divide, as he mentions there are forces on the left and right who can be

46
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:33,520
disintegrationists, though he spends roughly 95% of the book criticizing the left, with a few pages

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,920
thrown in where he complains about Marco Rubio and the alt-right even get a few paragraphs.

48
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,320
When it comes to left-wing forces trying to destroy America, here's one example he offers.

49
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,000
Mario Lopez committed the grave sin of suggesting that it would be dangerous as a parent to determine

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,920
based on a three-year-old's gender confusion that the child is indeed suffering from gender

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,960
dysphoria, adding, you're just a kid. This was enough to spur e to pressure Lopez for a public

52
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:05,120
apology, which he duly gave. The man has a family to support. So do we all. This breathless description

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,360
of Mario Lopez nearly having his life ruined had me laughing for a solid 15 seconds when I read it.

54
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,080
As if Mario Lopez is one bad take from his family being destitute living on the streets.

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,280
And this is representative of a lot of the supposed threats that this book details. Tiny

56
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:26,080
examples cherry-picked and then exaggerated to an absurd extreme. And some examples are just

57
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,040
flat-out distortions. Here's what one of those looks like. Disintegrationists have categorized

58
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,160
culturally unifying symbols like the American flag as inherently divisive. If America, as a

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,200
concept, is polarizing, so too is the flag. These sentences have a citation that will let us know

60
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,200
why Ben is making this very extreme claim. According to the article cited in the book,

61
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,120
this is taken from a new story about Traveler's Rest High School, where the principal banned

62
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,760
bringing the American flag to football games. This was because students were taunting a visiting team

63
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,400
from Berea High School, who were mostly Hispanic, by waving the flags in their face and shouting

64
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,520
things like, go home, leading to confrontations in the stands. Reading the principal's reasoning

65
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,880
hardly sounds like Shapiro's characterization. The principal wrote, using the American flag to

66
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,120
display disrespect or unsportsmanlike behavior is, in itself, improper and disrespectful to our flag.

67
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
He's clearly saying that it wasn't the American flag that was divisive. He was upset that the flag

68
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,720
was being used as camouflage for an attack on Hispanic teenagers. A few days later, after a

69
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,360
social media storm, the decision was reversed, although there was no criticism from Shapiro on

70
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:34,800
the mob justice in action here. Also, if you're curious, all of this took place in the conservative

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,160
Greenville County in the very conservative state of South Carolina, which hardly sounds like a

72
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,400
stronghold for the left. In just this little excerpt, we can see that Shapiro has taken a

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,280
single incident, lied about the intentions behind it, completely ignored the social media mob when

74
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,480
it worked in his favor, and then extrapolated his straw man to an entire group he's made up.

75
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,960
In other words, it's all a bunch of hot smoke. Now let's get to those three steps to destroy

76
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,520
America. Step one in destroying America is convincing citizens that some people will

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,840
have to sacrifice their existing rights in order for others to have new ones.

78
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,840
What a wonderfully vague statement. Luckily, he expands on what he means by

79
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,200
new rights. Saying that society can be improved because children can be molded into literally

80
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,440
anything opens the door to life-or-death fights about what they will be molded into.

81
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,680
It's hard to take Ben seriously when he uses terms such as literally anything,

82
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,040
as if children are being molded into boulders or rainbows. Throughout this book, and in much of his

83
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,680
rhetoric, Ben often characterizes the left in extreme terms to make them sound completely

84
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,560
unreasonable. So if someone is saying, perhaps we should, for example, allow children to have a

85
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,000
broader understanding of what gender means, is turned into literally anything. And when he writes

86
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,360
vaguely like this, he can make his bigotry against, for example, trans people sound like some kind of

87
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:56,640
high-minded principle. It's the intellectual camouflage for an ignorant and bigoted opinion.

88
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,800
Ben argues quite forcibly that the world is the way it is because of some kind of natural order.

89
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,840
He argues that the philosophy behind the founding of the United States of America,

90
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,600
as espoused in its founding documents, represent an understanding of fundamental human nature,

91
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,480
something Ben never quite defines. That by founding a nation based on this understanding

92
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:23,200
of human nature, the United States has uniquely organized itself to best allow human life to

93
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,680
flourish by respecting the natural rights of people. And hopefully alarm bells are going off

94
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,080
because even a basic knowledge of American history should reveal how poorly America has respected

95
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,480
the rights of people, but that will be addressed in the third step. Instead, the first is about

96
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:41,760
asserting the importance of protecting American values. Shapiro goes on. We are not gods and

97
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,480
simply do not have the capacity to rectify imbalances of innate individual qualities.

98
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,560
We don't have the ability to guarantee that even two kids the same age living on the same street

99
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,480
will start from the same point. Two children growing up in the same family don't even start

100
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,960
from the same point. Shapiro is fixated on this idea of inherent differences,

101
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,760
that outcomes can be explained on that basis. You could maybe argue that for individuals,

102
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:08,000
in that when you see a person who has succeeded greatly in the world, it may be down to some kind

103
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,800
of innate quality that has made success something easier for them. Though, of course, that discounts

104
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:17,680
how luck can play a role in an individual's life. For example, the luck of being a failed screen

105
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,600
writer who is fashioned into a conservative media figure by a billionaire trying to influence

106
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,240
popular discourse on politics using millions of dollars to create the illusion of talent.

107
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Of course, none of this really matters when we're talking about groups of people. Reducing

108
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,720
disparities to individual choices is a convenient way of ignoring structural and historic forces

109
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,120
that shape our lives and reduce the chances of groups of people to succeed in the world.

110
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,120
Unless the claim is the reason these groups aren't succeeding is because they have all

111
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,120
independently made the same or similar individual choices as if these disparities between two groups

112
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,320
are the reflection of some kind of natural defect. For example, if poor people are naturally

113
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:59,600
destined to be poor because they are innately incapable of being anything else. Perhaps their

114
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,240
innate intelligence, for instance, isn't high enough to succeed in the world. This, of course,

115
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,440
is the justification of philosophies such as social Darwinism, which say that people's success

116
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,040
in the world is a product of their inherent or natural abilities as opposed to historical or

117
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,920
social forces that shape our lives. Of course, what this argument really does is undermine any

118
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,280
attempt to change society for the better. Most of this book is an argument to keep society the way

119
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,840
it is and avoid any attempt at improving the structures that shape our lives. There are a

120
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:34,720
few cute moments of hypocrisy in this book, such as one part where Ben Shapiro complains that

121
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:40,320
Elizabeth Warren was selling billionaire tears mugs. Ben Shapiro, the man who has for years

122
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:45,440
been selling a tumbler that reads leftist tears. Though if you really want to shame Elizabeth

123
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,120
Warren, accusing her of stealing jokes from Ben Shapiro would be devastating. As always, whenever

124
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,160
we hear Ben Shapiro talking about being personally responsible and succeeding on your own merits,

125
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,440
I very much recommend the Vanity Fair article that details how Ben Shapiro was able to succeed

126
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,080
and become a conservative pundit, not through the strength of his own abilities, but through

127
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,960
the careful craftsmanship of a public media persona through the help of his business partner,

128
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:15,760
Jeremy Boring, and through the investment of millions of dollars to get his daily wire

129
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:20,880
operation off the ground. Let's move on to the next step, though. Step two in destroying America

130
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:25,440
is undermining our culture of rights in favor of a culture of protection by government.

131
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,240
You may have noticed step two doesn't follow step one. Why would you need to create new rights

132
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,280
in step one if you were creating a culture that undermines them? What Shapiro seems to be really

133
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,800
upset by is this expansion of what rights mean, to be anything that he can't effectively tie to

134
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,680
the founding documents of America. And of course, he is exclusively privileging his own interpretation

135
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,040
of those founding documents. In this discussion of rights, I had expected some mention of the

136
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,800
Universal Declaration of Human Rights published in 1948 and adopted by the United Nations,

137
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,440
especially considering the American connection of Eleanor Roosevelt. But Ben doesn't really compare

138
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,160
or contrast the American founding documents with anything. He describes the evolution of rights

139
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,560
throughout much of the Enlightenment as leading up to America and that discussion ending with

140
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,680
its founding, as if the American founding documents were so good and everything that's come afterward

141
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,960
simply isn't worth acknowledging. He simply takes what he knows and seems to assume that it is the

142
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,080
best and only version that should be considered. And his evidence for this is the greater material

143
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:31,120
success of the United States on the world stage. History is simply following a script that was

144
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:36,000
destined to happen, which leads us to this. The third and final step in destroying America is

145
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,200
convincing citizens that America represents fruit of the poisonous tree, that America was founded

146
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,160
in evil, and that there is no arc to history. To support this very heavy claim, we get a brief

147
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,160
rundown of American history and this gives us a really good understanding of how Ben Shapiro's

148
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,480
worldview is shaped. An honest recount of American history is a very mixed record. The

149
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,880
country that helped fight fascism in World War II is the same one that enslaved millions for nearly

150
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,080
a century. Shapiro acknowledges both sides of the record, but his framing is deeply suspect.

151
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,800
Any and all crimes perpetrated by the American state are waved away as simply being products

152
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,040
of their time, from the genocide of indigenous peoples, being reduced to the norm of nation

153
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:18,240
states of the day, to slavery being an institution being practiced around the globe. I'm not sure how

154
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,920
this is a defense. If he's trying to imply that we should criticize other countries for doing

155
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:27,200
similar things, I fully agree. But instead he's using this to shield any direct criticism of

156
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:32,000
America. This is probably best represented by a quote he uses that comes from Paul Johnson.

157
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,320
Europeans were moving into the former hunting grounds of the world's primitive peoples in five

158
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,920
continents. So when America is engaging in imperialism and seizing lands from indigenous

159
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,440
peoples and waging war on its neighbors, it's acting as Europeans do. But whenever the United

160
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:52,400
States writes something lovely in its founding documents, that is uniquely American. It's a

161
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:58,000
highly selective reading of America, designed to emphasize the good as American and the bad as

162
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,120
something foreign or belonging to the wider world. When discussing positive things the United States

163
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,920
has done, such as the aforementioned fighting of fascism, the title sections as those as

164
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,840
Savior of the West, something uniquely American that only this proud noble nation could accomplish,

165
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,120
as if World War II was fought and won solely by the United States. It seems insulting to all the

166
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,480
other nations that participated, but unsurprising as Ben doesn't seem concerned with the histories

167
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,720
of other nations or the broader interactions between them unless it can be used to further

168
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,680
glorify the United States. When discussing more negative aspects of American history,

169
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,000
Shapiro tends to frame them as favorably as possible. Here's one example describing

170
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,080
American westward expansion. Native American population density was, at the time, 0.17 persons

171
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,880
per square mile. The Census Bureau historically considered any area unsettled with a population

172
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:53,520
density of fewer than two people per square mile. In general, the pioneers were not wrong to

173
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:58,160
cast their eyes westward, although as we will see this population movement had dire consequences

174
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,440
for Native Americans. Ben doesn't even acknowledge the fact that the Census Bureau justifying

175
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:08,160
westward expansion of the American state is ridiculously self-serving. He also makes no

176
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,120
mention of the gold rush that sent scores of Americans west, or the concept of manifest

177
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,640
destiny which created a religious justification for the American expansion. Instead, the only

178
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,840
other factors he really mentions are the looming threat of European powers on the continent,

179
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,120
which in many ways reads like the justifications of the day for moving westward, which led to many

180
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,400
wars and the displacement and murder of countless indigenous people. Shapiro also feels the need to

181
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,200
add that inter-tribal warfare was common between Native American tribes, and he spends time

182
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:44,560
resisting the noble savage trope. And while I can understand wanting to push back against a stereotype

183
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,440
like the noble savage, a better reading of history would be if he instead cast these indigenous

184
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,960
peoples as human beings. In many ways, he seems to want the reader to not feel too sorry for these

185
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:59,920
indigenous peoples who were slaughtered and had their waves of life destroyed. His overall view

186
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,800
of history is that the bad is commonplace in the world, and even the victims aren't sates. But when

187
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,880
they're as good, it becomes uniquely American. Or as Ben puts it, when we can find injustice within

188
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,880
American history, that is our fault, but that is not America's fault. America was always great,

189
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,720
even if she was never perfect. He constantly refers to the eternal and good values represented

190
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,600
by America, something sacrosanct and unquestionable, and those who do question anything are to be

191
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,880
regarded as disintegrationists trying to destroy the country. It's amazing how little thought went

192
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,760
into this book. It's a collection of facts, often misinterpreted or misleading, and a series of

193
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,560
premises that aren't even a quarter baked. This was obviously produced as a product to be consumed

194
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:47,280
quickly and without much thought, the sort of thing for fans to buy, not to spark genuine political

195
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:52,320
discussion. Ironically though, I think it's sincere. This probably is Ben Shapiro trying his best to

196
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,480
write a thoughtful book about history and philosophy. He's just a bad writer and a shallow

197
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:02,320
thinker. It's perhaps best embodied by this quote here. To most Americans, America is about, and was

198
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,360
always about, the gradual realization of those beautiful promises, rights, and institutions for

199
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,760
all Americans. Perhaps most of us never thought about all that. Perhaps we just saw the flag

200
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:17,760
flying and felt it, or watched a 4th of July parade and knew it. The book isn't a serious appeal to

201
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,000
any well thought out concept of America, but rather a vindication of feelings of pride one

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,440
has when looking at the various symbols of America, a vindication of unthinking patriotism.

203
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:32,720
Ben Shapiro has done the work of figuring out that America is great and blameless, so those

204
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,400
reading this book don't have to think about it for themselves and continue their lives at

205
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:41,520
normal, remembering to salute the flag. Those who would say otherwise threaten that complacency,

206
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:46,080
possibly upsetting the natural order of things and ruining Ben's cushy life. So what Ben offers

207
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:51,040
in a book like this is a security blanket, an unironic version of that Stephen Colbert book,

208
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,600
America, re-becoming the greatness we never weren't. Let's move on to Glenn Beck's,

209
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,680
addicted to outrage how thinking like a recovering addict can heal the country.

210
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,800
We need a bit of context on Beck before we move forward though. This book was published in 2018,

211
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,040
and in the years leading up to it, Beck had a bit of an identity crisis. He was a never Trump

212
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:13,840
Republican, and during the 2016 election he tried to rebrand himself as a more moderate voice.

213
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:18,400
By 2018 he was pivoting again, claiming that he had gotten Trump completely wrong and while he

214
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,400
didn't like him stylistically, he thought he was doing a good job as president. This book is part

215
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,440
of that pivot, reframes outrage in political discourse as a creation of the media, including

216
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:32,400
himself in his earlier days. But he criticizes himself the same way he criticizes Trump.

217
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,760
His tone isn't great, but he still thinks he was right on the facts.

218
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:38,480
For those who don't remember some of those facts, here's a quick example.

219
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:50,720
Nationalists, graft, acorn style organizations, revolution and hidden agenda.

220
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:58,800
O-L-I-G-A-R-H. One letter is missing.

221
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:08,720
Why did I select these words? Because acorn selects tides. They all select their words first

222
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,960
and then tie them all together into one word. Oligarch, for quite the one that's missing, is why.

223
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,560
I'm pretty sure oligarchy has a C in there too. But on the substance of this argument,

224
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:25,040
you may have noticed that the Barack Obama presidency did not plunge America into some

225
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,040
kind of socialist oligarchy. But this exemplifies a lot of what Glenn Beck's Fox News show was all

226
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:36,080
about, telling us that Democrats are poised to create some kind of socialist hellscape.

227
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,320
These are the supposed facts he stands by. Glenn Beck, in this book, is trying to present

228
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,280
himself as a voice of reason. But he was never a reasonable guy, and he still isn't. And it

229
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,480
has nothing to do with his theatrics. Have I stepped through a wormhole and come out in France?

230
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,840
I mean, I'm not really sure if the... Look, there I am.

231
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,200
Okay, maybe not nothing. But the problem runs a lot deeper than the silly stuff.

232
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,640
Glenn Beck's book is a lot like Ben Shapiro's in that it hits similar notes. Although, to Beck's

233
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,040
credit, he presents a more fact-based reading of history. He goes into far greater detail,

234
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:11,120
bringing up specific crimes such as the Trail of Tears, where tens of thousands of Indigenous

235
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:15,200
people were displaced and forced to march west, or the destruction of Tulsa's Black Wall Street,

236
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,840
where a racist mob ransacked an affluent black community, killing many people and destroying

237
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,040
that community's economy. When Glenn Beck gets to the good side of America, it seems thin in

238
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:29,280
comparison to his chapter covering the bad. Though he weighs it all away with his discussion

239
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,480
about the moral character of America. It's a weird reading of history where, instead of using

240
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,960
it to understand the present, he instead would rather us look at history as a means for us to

241
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,960
sit back and judge the past, to decipher whether America good or America bad. Beck seems to want

242
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,960
us to ignore the past entirely when he writes, it's not what happens to you historically, what

243
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,440
matter is what you do with it now. Unless he's talking about learning lessons from history about

244
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:59,200
the left, ascending and bringing with it fascism. One example both Beck and Shapiro use to downplay

245
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,760
the impact of historical discrimination is when they compare Asian communities to black ones,

246
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,840
a comparison that is overly reductive as there are many different Asian and black communities

247
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:12,080
within the United States representing different waves of immigration and different historical

248
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,880
experiences. For example, using the case of Japanese Americans, which Ben Shapiro highlights

249
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:22,320
specifically, the interment of Japanese Americans during World War II led to the United States

250
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,560
government providing reparations, something that has never been done for black Americans who can

251
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,200
trace their ancestry back to slavery, regardless of what anyone even thinks of reparations. The

252
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:36,400
point I'm making here is that these two experiences are not the same, and to compare experiences like

253
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,520
these two, as both Glenn Beck and Ben Shapiro do in their books, is misleading. Glenn Beck's book

254
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,240
was also annoying to read as he tries to wrap this veil of respectability around himself still

255
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,160
pushing the same ridiculous talking points he always had been. Great example is how he talks

256
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,640
about climate change. Beck has a long history fighting against any sort of legislative solution

257
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,880
to climate change, and to hear his side of the story, he isn't denying the science, he's simply

258
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,280
concerned about the costs. Reading his book, he almost sounds reasonable when he writes,

259
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,680
I believe that the globe is warming as much as we can trust and verify the trends. Let me accept

260
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:12,320
the current claim that the world has warned by 0.7 degrees in the last hundred years. I also accept

261
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,880
that man can do significant damage to the planet and has done some damage over the industrial age.

262
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,960
It makes sense to me that belching toxins into the air is not good for any of us, including the

263
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:25,840
planet and his other inhabitants over time. Aside from some shaky language, that sounds fine.

264
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,160
But less than two pages later, he's saying, when you demand absolute acceptance of your theories

265
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:34,880
and back up your science with arguments of moral outrage, you end up having to shove, shout, and,

266
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,680
in the end, shoot. And then he goes on to compare climate change to religion and describes one side

267
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:45,200
as the Spanish Inquisition. This, to me, does not sound like the beginning of a reasonable debate.

268
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:50,720
This sounds like Glenn Beck is portraying one side as incapable of it. And more importantly,

269
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,280
regardless of what Glenn Beck says about the people who accept broad scientific consensus,

270
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,560
what exactly does he suggest we do about the aspects of climate change he's conceded are true?

271
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:05,680
Well, in this book he describes having an energy-efficient foam and some other personal measures,

272
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:11,200
and that's about it. While personal choices and living in a way that's more friendly to the

273
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,320
environment can certainly have an impact, a crisis as big as climate change cannot be solved through

274
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,560
people choosing to reduce their personal emissions alone. Huge polluters, such as the

275
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,200
US military or fossil fuel companies, need to be part of the solution too. When it comes to

276
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:30,800
policy-based initiatives or some kind of collective action to combat something Beck will ostensibly

277
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:35,760
say is true, he's far less willing and instead talks about how vague and untrustworthy science

278
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:41,040
can be. What good does Glenn Beck say he believes in climate change do if he's not willing to fight

279
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:45,760
for it beyond making a few personal concessions? Beck repeated this pattern in his commentary

280
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,160
about the COVID vaccines. Glenn Beck made a tweet about his opinion on the vaccine with this

281
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:55,680
charming photograph replacing a syringe with a middle finger. People assumed he was an anti-vaxxer,

282
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:02,960
so he went on Tucker Carlson's show to explain. I too am not anti-vaccine. I had COVID, my wife

283
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,720
had COVID, everybody in my family had it. I'm not going to get a vaccination because I've already

284
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:15,280
had it. What he's saying here is wrong. You can get COVID more than once, since the antibodies

285
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,600
don't last forever and a vaccine protects you from more serious symptoms. It also offers a

286
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,080
greater degree of protection against new variants. But more broadly, he's using the same tactic he

287
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,320
uses when he's talking about climate change. Make as many reasonable admissions as possible,

288
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:33,600
push them aside, and then use a bunch of anti-vaxx talking points. And when you make a good case,

289
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:41,440
then we'll follow. Make the case. But you can't question it. The problem is, even when he admits

290
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,040
to certain parts of the case, his position doesn't change. And if someone's ultimate

291
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,360
position stays the same, and the only change to their arguments is that they're predicated

292
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,240
by some admissions that ultimately don't change them, they're using those admissions to create

293
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:59,680
the illusion of carefully considering the evidence. An irony here is that in his book, Glenn Beck

294
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,160
wrote, we're spending our time arguing about the efficacy of vaccinations, a question that was

295
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,360
pretty much settled two centuries ago. So did he believe it was settled then and change his mind

296
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,440
in 2021? In 2009, Beck was fear-mongering about vaccines. If you say, don't take the swine flu

297
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:22,800
vaccination, and then, you know, it turns out that the swine flu, this particular wave is virulent,

298
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:27,360
and the vaccination would have helped. Well, then, you know, what role did I play in that?

299
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:34,000
The opposite is true. I say, hey, everybody take the vaccination. And that turns out to be

300
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,600
deadly? What role did I play in that? So he was skeptical of vaccines, then considered them

301
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,560
settled a few years later, and now he's once again skeptical. Some additional context might

302
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:50,720
help here. In 2009 and in 2021, these two vaccines were being championed by Barack Obama and Joe

303
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:55,920
Biden. And when we look at that quote from 2018 in Glenn Beck's book, we have to remember that

304
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:00,800
the vaccine discourse of the time was criticizing Trump for repeating lies about vaccine-causing

305
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:06,560
autism. In that context, the quote reads less about affirming the effectiveness of vaccines,

306
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:11,600
and is instead attempting to get the topic of vaccines out of the public discourse. Beck's

307
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,600
support of vaccination changes depending on who he's attacking and who he's trying to defend.

308
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,200
He'll accept the science, if it's the most effective way to provide cover for someone on

309
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:24,560
the right, and deny it if it's a part of attacking the left. Much like Ben Shapiro, Glenn Beck talks

310
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,960
about the founding fathers in tones that can only be described as religious. He refers to them

311
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,120
revealing an eternal truth. And then there's this line from the book. The Declaration of

312
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,120
Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights are the most divinely inspired documents,

313
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,080
perhaps of all time. I should remind you all that Glenn Beck is a Christian, and it's my understanding

314
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,640
that the Bible is pretty important to Christians. But Beck's worldview is probably more accurately

315
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:51,280
depicted in this painting by John McNaughton. One of the funny things about these books is the

316
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,760
complete lack of awareness that they are one part in a long line of human history, and that eventually

317
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,000
the mightiest empires crumble, and another takes its place. And then they get to pretend that they

318
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:05,440
are the best there ever was, and ever will be. It happened to the Umayyad Caliphate, the Mongol

319
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:10,320
Empire, and the British Empire, and it'll likely happen to the American Empire one day too. Unless

320
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,240
we all die before that, of course. The real difficulty with someone who has a religious

321
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,880
devotion to their country is that they're not easily challenged, and worse yet, this devotion

322
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,000
can be used to justify all sorts of horrible things. Both Glenn Beck and Ben Shapiro aggressively

323
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,880
argue for American greatness, its exceptionalism, and would sooner ignore the crimes of history to

324
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,280
bask in that glory. The rigidness to their interpretations of what America even means

325
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,280
is part of the problem. When the American government was committing genocide, enslaving

326
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,840
people, and refusing to acknowledge the rights of women and non-white men, this, politicians of

327
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,800
those days, would argue were an accurate interpretation of the foundy documents. Of course,

328
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,680
many people would disagree with that. The lesson of being open to discussion about interpretation

329
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,920
seems obvious to me, but it doesn't seem to have occurred to either Ben Shapiro or Glenn Beck that

330
00:26:55,920 --> 00:27:00,960
they might be wrong in their interpretation. To them, these are divinely inspired records of

331
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,440
eternal truth. That's not a great way to start the conversation or friendly debate these guys

332
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,680
pretend they want to have, and it's telling that their instructions for getting along with them

333
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:14,000
is outlining the certain types of debates they are not willing to have. I was going to spend some

334
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,120
time laughing at some of the fails Glenn Beck has throughout his book, but if we're going to laugh

335
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:23,280
at how dumb a book is, there's far more fertile ground in our next volume. Dave Rubins,

336
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:28,480
don't burn this book thinking for yourself in an age if unreason, is easily the laziest book of

337
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,000
the three I read. If Ben Shapiro and Glenn Beck are bringing their own brand of American exceptionalism

338
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,080
to the masses, Dave Rubin is the blueprint for how to be fooled by that message. Here's an example of

339
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:46,400
his prose. The left may no longer be liberal, but you're no longer left out. The rest of the book is

340
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,280
of similar quality. Of course, Rubins' project isn't to create an intellectual framework for

341
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:56,400
believing something. What he's doing, whether he's aware of this or not, is reinforcing a conservative

342
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,080
worldview built on ideas of American exceptionalism. Here's how he opens a chapter. Allow me to open

343
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,000
this chapter with a statement that's wildly controversial and gulag-worthy hate speech.

344
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,560
America is the greatest country in the history of the world. If you're triggered by this, stop

345
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:15,440
reading. While the second half of that lesson is solid advice, the rest of it isn't triggering

346
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:20,400
anybody. At best, you might get an eye roll. But what's important is the title of the chapter

347
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:25,920
that this little passage opens. Stop hating straight white men, America, and Western values.

348
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:30,880
Rubin is light on details about what Western values mean, and with regard to hating America,

349
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,080
he references some celebrities but doesn't go into detail about how or why they hate America.

350
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:41,280
As for not hating straight white men, it's an example of how he appeals to identity throughout

351
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:46,240
this book. Although he claims he's doing it ironically, Dave Rubin is constantly talking

352
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,320
about people's identities in his book. If someone makes a point he agrees with, he has to let you

353
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,320
know that he agrees with them even though they're a cis white male, and if he disagrees, he has to

354
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:59,200
make a comment about how it's not because they're a woman. Maybe he's just running this particular

355
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:04,480
attempt at a joke into the ground, but even if he's emphasizing everyone's identity for supposedly

356
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:09,120
a laugh, how many times does he have to do it until we can safely wonder if he's genuinely

357
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,000
obsessed with identity politics? It reminds me of someone who says they ironically enjoy a song

358
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,640
and are constantly singing or talking about it. At what point does that irony bleed into real

359
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,560
obsession? And sometimes he does the identity shtick in a more nefarious way. One anecdote Rubin

360
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:29,440
brings up is how at one of his live shows he was confronted by an audience member who was a genuine

361
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:35,040
Nazi. Rubin then put this Nazi first in line for the Q&A session so they could have a debate about

362
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:39,440
whether the Holocaust happened. In this discussion, most of the heavy lifting seems to have been done

363
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,080
by Rubin's guest, Michael Shermer, though Rubin pats them both on the back for the civilized debate

364
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:49,360
about whether or not this obvious historical fact occurred with a bigoted conspiracy theorist.

365
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,160
At no point does Rubin wonder how a Nazi showed up in his audience, and he doesn't explain why he

366
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:58,320
would choose to debate a Nazi instead of, say, someone on the left who might have been there,

367
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,960
assuming there was anyone from the left at this particular performance. But the truly sinister

368
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,760
part is the paragraph he uses to close the anecdote. One final note on this, it turned out

369
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:13,040
that the Holocaust-denied woman was transgender. Yes, that's right, a trans Holocaust denier.

370
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,880
Do with that what you will. What exactly does Rubin expect anyone to do with that? Personally,

371
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,040
it means nothing to me. Being trans doesn't disqualify someone from being a hateful conspiracy

372
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:28,160
theorist, but to an anti-trans bigot, it would be a helpful anecdote to push their own agenda

373
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:33,280
of discriminating against trans people, presenting them as mentally unbalanced. Rubin must know who

374
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,520
he's serving by bringing up such a meaningless fact. Here's another example of Rubin being

375
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:43,040
completely ridiculous. First of all, no. We're not an imperialist country. The United States

376
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:48,800
was literally founded on a pushback against imperialism. If I may have my own, first of all,

377
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,400
I wouldn't reduce the Revolutionary War to a pushback. And second, how can he possibly be

378
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:59,200
this naive? I would think any political commentator would have some awareness of

379
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,560
American hegemonic influence around the world. There are American military bases in over 70

380
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:09,360
countries and territories. The U.S. exerts its influence everywhere. But since it doesn't fit

381
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,080
the definition of an imperial power from centuries past, Rubin washes his hands of understanding the

382
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,160
tremendous influence the United States has over many parts of the world, and how that might fit

383
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:23,360
the definition of imperial. But it's not surprising he doesn't know or bother to know any of that.

384
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,280
Because as I mentioned earlier, the one word that captures this book so well is lazy. Rubin

385
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,240
brings up a number of different topics, sometimes more than once, and often has little to nothing

386
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,840
of value to say about them. At one point in the book, he copies and pastes three pages of supposed

387
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,360
facts from PragerU. When he tries to do his own version of Jordan Peterson's 12 Rules for Life,

388
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,680
he can't even think of 12 and only writes six. In the section where he cites his sources,

389
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:54,080
he can barely fill three pages. Rubin's final message for the reader, one that

390
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,480
encapsulates his political philosophy, is to go out there and live your life and ignore all the

391
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,760
nonsense. Yes, his version of activism is to chill out and enjoy life. While I fully support Dave

392
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,400
Rubin, or anyone who finds him insightful, to disengage with the political process, he must

393
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,960
realize how his final message is the antithesis of a call to action that a political commentator

394
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,000
would typically make. Dave Rubin is the rube Ben Shapiro and Glenn Beck are selling their American

395
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,080
exceptionalism narrative to, someone who will unthinkingly accept the mythology of American

396
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,920
greatness and then completely disengage from the political process, because there's no reason to

397
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,400
improve on something that's already great. Unless it's to complain about identity politics. While

398
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:35,040
tacitly endorsing bigotry, of course. The danger of this type of lazy patriotism is that it can

399
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,000
be used to maintain a bad status quo, or be used as a cover for the far right to bring in fascism

400
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,960
under the cloak of patriotism, reducing a country to facet out principles devoid of interpretation

401
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:49,920
or nuance, and then insisting everyone prostrate themselves by proclaiming an overwhelming love of

402
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,360
the nation via symbols like the anthem and flag, turns political participation into a sporting

403
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,080
event. It's not about making society better, it's about cheering for the home team. And these books

404
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,840
aren't weighty discussions of politics, they're a merch to buy to show your support for the team

405
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,720
you're backing. That is, if anyone is buying these at all. Books by conservative pundits and

406
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,840
politicians regularly appear on the New York Times bestseller list, only with a small caveat

407
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:18,080
in the shape of a dagger that appears next to them. Here's the New York Times' explanation.

408
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,200
A dagger indicates that some retailers report receiving bulk orders. While not every book by a

409
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,840
conservative pundit has one of these symbols next to it, a large number do. In fact, while looking

410
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:32,400
through the hardcover non-fiction list, the dagger symbol almost only comes up for books written by

411
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,800
conservative pundits or politicians. In the case of all three books I mentioned in this video,

412
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:40,880
they debuted on the list with daggers, indicating bulk purchases, and were on the bestseller list

413
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,480
for, at most, three weeks. This isn't exactly a new finding, as it was detailed in an op-ed

414
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,400
written for The Hill referencing a well-known example of Donald Trump's book Triggered,

415
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,840
which reached number one on the list thanks to a $94,800 purchase from the Republican National

416
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,480
Committee. A Vox article describes how appearing on the list can boost sales on average from 13 to

417
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,720
14% or up to 57% for new authors. It also bestows credibility and potentially a higher advance on

418
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:11,600
future books. An article in Vanity Fair also noted that the former president's son is hardly

419
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:16,160
the only one benefiting from these bulk purchases. The National Republican Congressional Committee

420
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:22,240
spent nearly $400,000 on bulk purchases, notably spending nearly $100,000 buying copies of Dan

421
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,720
Crenshaw's Fortitude. In 2015, Ted Cruz used $300,000 in campaign funds to buy copies of one

422
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,360
of his books, A Time for Truth. It's easier to track down the bulk sales of politicians because

423
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:38,880
groups like the RNC and NRCC need to publicly report their spending. When it comes to pundits,

424
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:44,000
like the authors highlighted in this video, it gets murkier. Some hypotheses have been floated,

425
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,320
such as bulk purchases being demanded ahead of speaking engagements or book signings.

426
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,400
It's hard to say exactly, and it's not as though people don't purchase books by conservative

427
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:57,280
pundits. Bill O'Reilly has had plenty of success killing anything with a pulse, but his books tend

428
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,840
to stay on the bestseller lists for months at a time, which seems to reflect a genuine interest

429
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,000
in his work. These other authors, at least the ones I've covered in this video, don't have

430
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,720
nearly the staying power. It reveals a lack of genuine demand for these titles, outside of,

431
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,720
perhaps, a select devoted few. So devoted that apparently they all engage in bulk purchases.

432
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,440
And I don't blame the wider reading public for not caring. These are terrible books. The Dave

433
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,600
Rubin one in particular would be more readable after using it as toilet paper, and the other

434
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,160
two are little more than poor arguments for American exceptionalism. Assuming someone really

435
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,040
is buying these, they would make solid additions to one of the worst libraries of books to ever be

436
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,200
created. So what can we possibly take away from this discussion of three random conservative

437
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:46,960
non-fiction titles? They seem to be a blueprint on how to disengage with the political process.

438
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:53,200
To accept that America is great and that anyone trying to change it is actually time to destroy

439
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,520
America. That politics are something we don't need to get particularly passionate about.

440
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,920
It's best to just disengage and remove yourself from the political process,

441
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:07,200
and let the status quo rumble on completely indifferent to their real world struggle.

442
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,720
Do consider becoming a patron. You can join the lovely name scrolling up the screen

443
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,240
right now, and you'll also get early access to videos and links to my theme song. You get all

444
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,560
of that at the five dollar tier. If you join the one dollar tier, you of course get my thanks,

445
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,560
but also get access to exclusive updates where I let people know what's going on with the next

446
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,040
video. If you'd like to help the channel in a non-monetary fashion, you can like, comment,

447
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:38,000
and if you haven't already, subscribe, and hit the bell for notifications. Sometimes I do streams,

448
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,640
so hitting that bell to see notifications for community posts is a great way to find out when

449
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,720
those are happening. Thank you everyone for watching.
