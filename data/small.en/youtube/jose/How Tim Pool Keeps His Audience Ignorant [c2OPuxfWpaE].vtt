WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:04.360
This video was originally recorded on December 28th.

00:04.360 --> 00:07.120
Things clearly have changed a lot,

00:07.120 --> 00:09.840
especially with the events that happened on January 6th

00:09.840 --> 00:11.140
in Washington, D.C.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.080
I recorded several minutes

00:13.080 --> 00:15.020
and placed them at the end of this video.

00:15.020 --> 00:17.760
The rest of the video is as it was originally recorded,

00:17.760 --> 00:19.800
and I hope the conclusion will tie it together

00:19.800 --> 00:21.160
in a way that makes sense.

00:22.160 --> 00:23.360
The world is weird, it makes me mad,

00:23.360 --> 00:26.400
but at least I get to talk about it with Jose.

00:26.400 --> 00:31.600
When someone tunes into a news commentary channel,

00:31.600 --> 00:33.640
they're expecting two different things,

00:33.640 --> 00:34.960
to learn about the news of the day

00:34.960 --> 00:38.000
and be provided with a context in which to understand it.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.800
This is the basis for most YouTube channels

00:39.800 --> 00:41.200
that comment on the news.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.480
They're all structured the same way,

00:42.480 --> 00:45.760
with a brief rundown of the story and then some analysis.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.600
Depending on the political leanings of the channel,

00:47.600 --> 00:50.040
you can get news from whatever point on the political spectrum

00:50.040 --> 00:51.880
you might be interested in hearing from.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.920
And correspondingly, their choice of stories

00:54.040 --> 00:57.080
and how they're presented will reflect that worldview.

00:57.080 --> 00:59.160
It's true of every political YouTube channel,

00:59.160 --> 01:00.000
this one included.

01:00.000 --> 01:03.000
You're never getting the capital T truth about anything,

01:03.000 --> 01:04.520
rather you're getting the perspective

01:04.520 --> 01:06.000
of the person speaking.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.760
Which brings us to Tim Pool.

01:07.760 --> 01:09.480
Across his three YouTube channels,

01:09.480 --> 01:11.560
he publishes multiple videos daily.

01:11.560 --> 01:14.240
This can mean he uploads six or seven different videos

01:14.240 --> 01:17.400
from 10 to 30 minutes in length on his main two channels,

01:17.400 --> 01:19.280
Tim Pool and Timcast,

01:19.280 --> 01:22.600
and videos that can stretch on for four hours

01:22.600 --> 01:25.160
on his Timcast IRL channel.

01:25.160 --> 01:27.840
Tim Pool's main two channels focused exclusively

01:27.840 --> 01:30.040
on his own perspective on the news of the day.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.760
And his perspective provides his audience

01:31.760 --> 01:33.800
with a selection of news stories and analysis

01:33.800 --> 01:35.400
that makes them less informed

01:35.400 --> 01:38.360
after having watched one or more of his videos.

01:38.360 --> 01:39.480
Here's a quick example.

01:39.480 --> 01:40.320
Back in mid November,

01:40.320 --> 01:42.360
the United States was seeing another surge

01:42.360 --> 01:43.560
in COVID infections.

01:43.560 --> 01:45.480
Now imagine you're someone who goes to Tim's channel

01:45.480 --> 01:47.360
looking for the latest update on COVID.

01:47.360 --> 01:49.320
On November 17th, 2020,

01:49.320 --> 01:50.760
you would find a video titled,

01:50.760 --> 01:54.240
stores stripped as COVID lockdown sparks panic.

01:54.240 --> 01:57.440
Tucker Carlson warns of the great reset.

01:57.440 --> 01:59.480
The main thrust of this video is some commentary

01:59.480 --> 02:01.360
about how the threat of COVID is overblown,

02:01.360 --> 02:03.280
tests may not be trustworthy,

02:03.280 --> 02:05.680
and that there's some kind of nefarious plot

02:05.680 --> 02:08.800
with the elites trying to reshape society.

02:08.800 --> 02:10.280
Here's how Tim breaks down

02:10.280 --> 02:12.280
the increasing number of COVID cases.

02:12.280 --> 02:16.720
Number of US deaths per day has not spiked.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.680
Look at where it was early on.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.960
And now it's actually, there's a spike right here.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.040
It's a little spike.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.080
It's going up and we're worried about that.

02:25.080 --> 02:28.480
And I can understand saying we need to take precautions

02:28.480 --> 02:30.320
to prevent this spike from skyrocketing,

02:30.320 --> 02:32.320
but take a look at cases.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.320
Number of new infections per day is higher

02:34.320 --> 02:35.640
than it's ever been,

02:35.640 --> 02:38.800
but the death rate is way, way, way down.

02:38.800 --> 02:42.520
I'm not convinced we're facing extreme circumstances just yet.

02:42.520 --> 02:46.040
It makes no sense to destroy the lives of so many people.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.320
Number of cases are going up,

02:47.360 --> 02:48.960
but since deaths remained low,

02:48.960 --> 02:51.080
Tim says the danger is being overblown.

02:51.080 --> 02:53.280
He repeated this in a November 18th video

02:53.280 --> 02:56.920
titled, Protests Overforced, Vaccinations Erupt,

02:56.920 --> 03:01.080
Democrats Openly Violate Lockdown, Dark Winter is Coming.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.760
That's really ominous.

03:02.760 --> 03:05.240
Right now, the fact we can point out

03:05.240 --> 03:07.960
is that hospitalizations are not going up

03:07.960 --> 03:09.960
and deaths are only spiked a little bit,

03:09.960 --> 03:11.040
not as bad as it was.

03:11.040 --> 03:12.800
It went up and then it went back down.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.480
Now let's compare this to some commentary

03:14.480 --> 03:16.360
from another commentator, Sam Seder,

03:16.360 --> 03:18.880
in a video a few days prior, November 13th,

03:18.880 --> 03:23.720
titled, Sam Breaks Down the Startly New COVID Numbers.

03:23.720 --> 03:27.320
Hospitalizations and deaths are lagging indicators.

03:27.320 --> 03:32.120
So what's going on today in terms of infections

03:32.120 --> 03:34.160
is going to implicate hospitalizations

03:34.160 --> 03:36.400
two to three weeks from now.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.080
It's gonna be a really tragic lesson

03:39.080 --> 03:44.080
for tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of people.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.920
This is not to mention, you know,

03:45.920 --> 03:47.960
the implications, long-term implications

03:47.960 --> 03:51.440
for a lot of people of getting COVID.

03:51.440 --> 03:54.760
It is, we're just watching this slow motion tragedy.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.360
A very different prognosis.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.480
What Tim sees as alarmism orchestrated

03:59.480 --> 04:01.720
by a group of elites to enact their agenda,

04:01.720 --> 04:03.360
Sam presents as a real danger

04:03.360 --> 04:05.600
that will lead to higher death rates in the near future.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.960
With the benefit of hindsight,

04:06.960 --> 04:09.520
we can very easily see who got this one right.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.520
Throughout December, deaths have been skyrocketing

04:11.520 --> 04:12.640
in the United States,

04:12.640 --> 04:15.920
with reports now regularly reaching over 3,000 a day.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.760
And this isn't a case of a commentator having psychic powers.

04:18.760 --> 04:20.520
It's been well known for a while that,

04:20.520 --> 04:23.520
when it comes to indicators on the severity of the COVID crisis,

04:23.520 --> 04:25.680
deaths are a lagging indicator,

04:25.680 --> 04:28.240
typically lagging behind infections.

04:28.240 --> 04:30.440
That's because after being diagnosed with COVID,

04:30.440 --> 04:33.640
people usually have two weeks before the symptoms get serious.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.360
So if there's an increase in the number of cases being reported,

04:36.360 --> 04:37.720
a spike in the number of deaths

04:37.720 --> 04:39.840
is likely to occur a few weeks later.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.840
The fact that Tim looked at both numbers

04:41.840 --> 04:44.280
of infections and number of deaths on the same day

04:44.280 --> 04:45.600
without mentioning this fact,

04:45.600 --> 04:47.040
and if anything providing commentary

04:47.040 --> 04:50.000
that ran contrary to the idea that a big spike was coming,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.280
left his audience misinformed about the danger of COVID-19.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.720
This is one small example of how Tim keeps his audience ignorant.

04:56.720 --> 04:58.680
In a look at the sources used by Tim Pool

04:58.680 --> 05:00.560
from a sample of his videos in 2020,

05:00.560 --> 05:02.960
the numbers reveal that the vast majority of Tim Pool's sources

05:02.960 --> 05:03.920
are right-wing,

05:03.920 --> 05:07.440
accounting for 59% of the sources he uses in his videos.

05:07.440 --> 05:09.400
But even more than that, Tim's attitudes

05:09.400 --> 05:11.480
towards the media sources he uses

05:11.600 --> 05:12.880
and the sources he presents

05:12.880 --> 05:14.920
reveals even more about his commentary.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.800
Here's an example of how Tim speaks about the mainstream media.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.200
The mainstream media has been lying to them

05:20.200 --> 05:22.200
and covering up these stories.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.000
They don't get it.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.480
How insane is it?

05:25.480 --> 05:27.320
When he speaks about right-wing media,

05:27.320 --> 05:28.960
his tone quickly shifts.

05:28.960 --> 05:33.160
For example, here are some comments he made about right-wing populist Tucker Carlson.

05:33.160 --> 05:37.360
Tucker Carlson has once again saved the world.

05:37.360 --> 05:39.960
Yes, I'm being a bit tongue-in-cheek,

05:39.960 --> 05:41.440
but to a certain extent,

05:41.440 --> 05:43.400
you could say Tucker Carlson literally saved the world.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.960
Wow, okay.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.120
This reveals a very clear bias towards right-wing media,

05:48.120 --> 05:49.880
one that colors Tim's commentary,

05:49.880 --> 05:52.600
giving it a distinctly right-wing slant.

05:52.600 --> 05:56.040
He'll accuse the far-left media, at least in his mind,

05:56.040 --> 05:58.960
of taking every opportunity to advance its agenda,

05:58.960 --> 06:02.240
whereas Tucker Carlson, who is at the very least

06:02.240 --> 06:05.920
also pushing an agenda, is some kind of savior.

06:05.920 --> 06:07.400
When you take that into consideration,

06:07.400 --> 06:09.920
it's not surprising that most of the new stories he presents

06:09.920 --> 06:12.160
come from a right-wing perspective.

06:12.160 --> 06:14.240
This reliance on right-wing media

06:14.240 --> 06:17.680
has led Tim to advance some questionable right-wing narratives,

06:17.680 --> 06:19.840
most recently pushing the idea that Donald Trump

06:19.840 --> 06:22.320
has a chance of retaining his presidency.

06:22.320 --> 06:25.440
In the days following the November 3rd, 2020 federal election,

06:25.440 --> 06:27.720
it became increasingly clear that Joe Biden

06:27.720 --> 06:30.800
would be declared the next president-elect.

06:30.800 --> 06:33.600
There's a fun supercut of all the times Tim pull predicted

06:33.600 --> 06:37.880
a landslide victory for Republicans in that very election.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.760
No amount of mail-in ballots will matter.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.600
If Trump gets 537 or 36, or even 538,

06:44.600 --> 06:46.240
every single electoral vote.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.600
We all know Joe Biden will lose.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.880
Like, let's be real, man.

06:49.880 --> 06:52.400
As I've stated a million and one times,

06:52.400 --> 06:53.560
Donald Trump's gonna win.

06:53.560 --> 06:54.960
The Republicans are gonna sweep.

06:54.960 --> 06:59.960
Ladies and gentlemen, Joe Biden has defeated Donald Trump.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.440
Everything I've told you will be wrong

07:02.440 --> 07:04.240
and completely meaningless.

07:04.240 --> 07:05.680
So keep that in mind.

07:05.680 --> 07:08.240
Since then, Tim has argued that he was only presenting

07:08.240 --> 07:10.920
a hypothetical based on a story he read

07:10.920 --> 07:13.760
and that he didn't think this was a likely outcome.

07:13.760 --> 07:15.960
In the astronomical event that Donald Trump

07:15.960 --> 07:19.280
somehow pulls off a triple hat trick in these states,

07:19.280 --> 07:22.640
I'm gonna play that crab dancing song, Bagatcha, uh-huh.

07:22.640 --> 07:25.240
Although it's not really what I meant back in the day,

07:25.240 --> 07:26.800
but you know, several months ago when I was like,

07:26.800 --> 07:27.840
I think this will lend itself

07:27.840 --> 07:29.560
to a Donald Trump landslide victory.

07:29.560 --> 07:33.200
As a reminder, he had made this prediction many, many times

07:33.200 --> 07:36.480
and certainly within two months before the election.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.480
I'll tell you what I think's gonna happen.

07:37.480 --> 07:38.520
I think they're cheating.

07:38.520 --> 07:40.000
I think Trump's gonna landslide.

07:40.000 --> 07:42.920
I think Trump would have had a landslide no matter what.

07:42.920 --> 07:44.480
I think the polls are fake.

07:44.480 --> 07:46.760
And I think what's happening now is Trump's gonna win

07:46.760 --> 07:48.800
and they're gonna say, ah, but he didn't really win.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.480
Now that we've seen those fun clips,

07:50.480 --> 07:52.480
let's talk about coping.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.240
While some people are very happy to point out

07:54.240 --> 07:57.000
that Tim is coping over being wrong in his predictions,

07:57.000 --> 07:58.740
this is missing the more important part

07:58.740 --> 08:00.440
of what's going on with Tim's channel.

08:00.440 --> 08:03.640
His viewers don't turn in to watch him get high on copium.

08:03.640 --> 08:06.000
They're going there for a fix themselves.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.440
You see, Tim isn't a user.

08:08.440 --> 08:10.400
He's a copium dealer.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.320
Here's what I mean.

08:11.320 --> 08:14.160
Although a Biden victory was increasingly obvious

08:14.160 --> 08:16.840
following the days of the election as the votes were counted

08:16.840 --> 08:18.320
and he had a clear lead,

08:18.320 --> 08:19.940
you wouldn't know it looking at the titles

08:19.940 --> 08:22.000
of many of Tim Poole's videos.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.300
They read, Wisconsin lawmaker says electoral college

08:25.300 --> 08:29.880
should reject results paving way for Trump win.

08:29.880 --> 08:33.680
Major victory for GOP, judge rules mail-in voting

08:33.680 --> 08:35.540
likely unconstitutional.

08:35.540 --> 08:39.400
Trump may win or block PA.

08:39.400 --> 08:41.820
Leftists and Democrats start panicking

08:41.820 --> 08:44.400
as they realize Trump is actually winning

08:44.400 --> 08:46.040
political victories.

08:46.040 --> 08:50.160
These headlines are dripping with a Trump-flavored sweat

08:50.160 --> 08:52.780
beckoning any of his supporters for a quick taste

08:52.780 --> 08:54.640
of this delicious copium

08:54.640 --> 08:57.280
with the promise that things are swinging in Trump's favor

08:57.280 --> 08:59.380
that hope still lives on.

08:59.380 --> 09:02.160
When it comes to the actual contents of these videos,

09:02.200 --> 09:04.900
I would be misrepresenting them if I didn't mention that.

09:04.900 --> 09:07.240
Tim believes that these various efforts

09:07.240 --> 09:10.200
to win Trump the presidency are long shots.

09:10.200 --> 09:12.440
He certainly does say that quite a bit,

09:12.440 --> 09:14.720
but there's always a but.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.960
I don't think it's very likely that Trump pulls this off.

09:16.960 --> 09:19.480
I really, really don't, but he's a trying

09:19.480 --> 09:21.600
and his argument seems to make sense.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.120
You know, Joe Biden is gonna win this one,

09:24.120 --> 09:25.460
but this is where it gets crazy.

09:25.460 --> 09:29.000
So it may seem astronomical that Trump actually succeeds,

09:29.000 --> 09:30.480
but he's gaining ground

09:30.480 --> 09:33.860
in every place he needs to gain ground.

09:33.860 --> 09:34.840
That's the best way to put it.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.520
I've said over and over again

09:36.520 --> 09:38.200
that it seems that the likely that Trump

09:38.200 --> 09:41.640
actually pulls off some victory here is astronomical,

09:41.640 --> 09:42.640
but possible.

09:42.640 --> 09:44.440
And Tim was constantly pushing back

09:44.440 --> 09:45.980
when it would be clear that Joe Biden

09:45.980 --> 09:48.800
could be safely declared the president-elect.

09:48.800 --> 09:51.520
At first he was saying it was December 14th

09:51.520 --> 09:53.320
when the electoral college voted.

09:53.320 --> 09:55.060
Until we get to this point

09:55.060 --> 09:57.580
where we have certified results on the 14th,

09:57.580 --> 09:59.260
then it was January 6th

09:59.260 --> 10:01.340
when the results are tabulated by the vice president.

10:01.340 --> 10:03.180
The vice president becomes president-elect

10:03.180 --> 10:05.940
as far as I can tell on January 6th.

10:05.940 --> 10:08.380
I was wrong before, I thought it was the 14th.

10:08.380 --> 10:11.940
And then January 20th, the date of inauguration itself.

10:11.940 --> 10:14.420
The only date that matters is January 20th

10:14.420 --> 10:15.700
as per the constitution.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.880
The impression this creates in the minds of his viewers

10:17.880 --> 10:20.980
is that there might be something to this whole Trump comeback,

10:20.980 --> 10:23.360
that there's a chance it could work.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.380
Even though Tim personally doesn't believe it,

10:25.380 --> 10:27.500
he's always quick to mention his opinion

10:28.260 --> 10:29.100
but it doesn't really matter.

10:29.100 --> 10:31.140
But it doesn't matter what I think as I often say.

10:31.140 --> 10:33.860
Tim believes it's his job to deliver the news

10:33.860 --> 10:35.900
and let his audience make of it what they will.

10:35.900 --> 10:38.120
People wanna say Trump is gonna lose, fine, that's for them.

10:38.120 --> 10:39.440
That's not what I do, okay?

10:39.440 --> 10:42.300
I try to be rational, reasonable,

10:42.300 --> 10:44.380
understand what's happening and tell you.

10:44.380 --> 10:47.060
But it's the news he's choosing to deliver that matters.

10:47.060 --> 10:49.520
Dozens of his videos were devoted to every morsel

10:49.520 --> 10:51.420
of a chance he could spot of Donald Trump

10:51.420 --> 10:53.360
overturning the results of the election.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.980
Something that any Trump friend would be desperate to hear.

10:56.020 --> 10:57.860
Part of delivering the copia means

10:57.860 --> 11:00.540
not just choosing the right sources or spectacles

11:00.540 --> 11:02.540
but also choosing the right stories.

11:02.540 --> 11:04.680
The ones that will keep his audience hopeful

11:04.680 --> 11:06.180
and keep them watching.

11:06.180 --> 11:08.360
It isn't surprising to find dozens of comments

11:08.360 --> 11:10.980
under his videos from desperate Trump fans.

11:10.980 --> 11:12.980
Here are a few examples.

11:12.980 --> 11:14.260
As a non-American,

11:14.260 --> 11:17.260
I have to say Americans should never back down.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.700
The future of the world and freedom

11:18.700 --> 11:20.700
depend on Trump's winning.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.480
We don't care about mass riots.

11:22.480 --> 11:25.820
We care about getting it right and not turning into China.

11:25.820 --> 11:29.260
Trump won PA by a landslide, it's clear.

11:29.260 --> 11:32.180
Democrat sloppy cheating is so obvious.

11:32.180 --> 11:33.640
It's legitimately disgusting

11:33.640 --> 11:36.420
and only proves we live in a banana republic.

11:36.420 --> 11:38.220
And Tim reinforces the actions

11:38.220 --> 11:40.300
of Trump supporters at every turn.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.140
If you're a Trump supporter,

11:41.140 --> 11:44.080
you probably believe he's gonna do it.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.900
While the left is saying Trump will lose

11:45.900 --> 11:47.640
and the right is saying Trump will win.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.100
There's rational moderate people saying like,

11:50.100 --> 11:52.140
Trump might win, okay?

11:52.140 --> 11:53.780
And that's how you make the copia.

11:53.800 --> 11:56.300
Tim himself acknowledges how remote the chances are,

11:56.300 --> 11:58.460
but by fixating on every minor development

11:58.460 --> 11:59.780
and its implications,

11:59.780 --> 12:01.620
he keeps hope alive in Trump supporters.

12:01.620 --> 12:03.140
All the while hiding behind the idea

12:03.140 --> 12:05.700
that he's only talking about something possible,

12:05.700 --> 12:08.380
not necessarily something probable.

12:08.380 --> 12:09.500
But when he says that,

12:09.500 --> 12:11.420
he isn't doing it to inform his audience

12:11.420 --> 12:13.100
of the realistic possibilities.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.380
He's doing that to protect his own credibility.

12:15.380 --> 12:18.140
If he was providing adequate commentary for these stories,

12:18.140 --> 12:20.620
he would be highlighting how incredibly remote

12:20.620 --> 12:23.500
and absurd it is to think that these will actually happen.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.860
All of these stories are nonsense.

12:25.860 --> 12:28.100
And while I could claim the benefit of hindsight

12:28.100 --> 12:29.380
saying they wouldn't work out,

12:29.380 --> 12:32.140
even at the time these were absurd long shots,

12:32.140 --> 12:34.420
meant to just pump out video after video

12:34.420 --> 12:36.500
presenting them as the next big chance

12:36.500 --> 12:37.900
or a possible opportunity

12:37.900 --> 12:40.100
for a change in the outcome of the election,

12:40.100 --> 12:42.100
even with the little disclaimers,

12:42.100 --> 12:44.820
simply isn't giving his audience an accurate depiction

12:44.820 --> 12:46.500
of what's happening in the world.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.620
It's only giving them false hope.

12:48.620 --> 12:50.440
The reaction from his audience makes it clear

12:50.440 --> 12:52.300
that anyone tuning into these videos

12:52.300 --> 12:54.260
is doing so to hear about how Trump

12:54.260 --> 12:57.700
might still get a second term in 2021.

12:57.700 --> 13:00.220
And just to nail this point home a little bit harder,

13:00.220 --> 13:03.180
I wanna highlight the short saga of the Texas lawsuit,

13:03.180 --> 13:04.980
which would supposedly overturn the results

13:04.980 --> 13:07.500
in several states Trump had lost during the election.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.300
Tim got on the ground floor with this story

13:09.300 --> 13:11.160
before it had been thoroughly undermined

13:11.160 --> 13:12.700
by the mainstream media.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.500
On Twitter, Tim expects patience on this revelation,

13:15.500 --> 13:18.220
claiming that before making any statements on this new case,

13:18.220 --> 13:20.540
we should wait and see how the Supreme Court ruled on it.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.620
That same day, he released a video titled,

13:22.620 --> 13:25.400
Texas just nuked Democrats from orbit

13:25.400 --> 13:30.140
with SCOTUS lawsuit calling election unconstitutional.

13:30.140 --> 13:31.540
Because Tim was lurking late at night,

13:31.540 --> 13:33.940
this video came out early in the life cycle of this story

13:33.940 --> 13:36.660
before the mainstream media had torn this story to pieces.

13:36.660 --> 13:38.940
And blissfully ignorant of the real possibilities

13:38.940 --> 13:41.800
of this working out, they were actually really low,

13:41.800 --> 13:44.500
Tim is breathless in describing it.

13:44.500 --> 13:46.780
They're probably gonna win this one, and this is huge.

13:46.780 --> 13:48.320
This is gonna change the outcome of the election.

13:48.320 --> 13:50.640
In my opinion, we'll see.

13:50.640 --> 13:51.600
A few days later, though,

13:51.600 --> 13:53.520
when the Supreme Court dismissed the case,

13:53.520 --> 13:56.160
Tim takes a different tone in the video.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.560
Texas GOP calls for new union of states

13:59.560 --> 14:03.040
as SCOTUS denies lawsuit disputing election.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.260
It's not over.

14:05.260 --> 14:07.520
I'll tell ya, it is not over until Joe Biden

14:07.520 --> 14:10.640
is in the White House, and even then, it might not end.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.600
They don't get it.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.400
They don't understand what's happening.

14:13.400 --> 14:16.840
Tim went out on a limb for this story, and he got burnt.

14:16.840 --> 14:19.400
It ended up going nowhere and doing nothing,

14:19.400 --> 14:21.800
like every attempt Trump and his team have made

14:21.800 --> 14:23.880
to change the results of the election.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.480
But Tim can't have his audience walking away

14:25.480 --> 14:27.760
from his videos feeling dejected and defeated,

14:27.760 --> 14:29.300
and so he pushes the deadline

14:29.300 --> 14:32.240
of when things will be over to never.

14:32.240 --> 14:34.280
Things will never be over.

14:34.280 --> 14:37.360
Trump supporters will never accept this election,

14:37.360 --> 14:40.280
and soon, we're gonna have a civil war.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.660
Tim's rule as copium dealers should be understood

14:42.660 --> 14:46.360
as broadly anti-left and specifically pro-Trump.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.660
That is to say, he's more likely to produce content

14:48.660 --> 14:51.280
that attacks left-wing social views and politicians,

14:51.280 --> 14:53.120
and more likely to defend right-wing ones

14:53.120 --> 14:55.920
as they relate specifically to Donald Trump.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.960
That isn't to say he never does the opposite

14:57.960 --> 14:59.240
of either of those things.

14:59.240 --> 15:02.200
It's just highly unlikely he'll either title a video

15:02.200 --> 15:04.600
or spend most of his time praising the left

15:04.600 --> 15:06.580
or criticizing Donald Trump.

15:06.580 --> 15:08.840
What's quite striking is how protective he is

15:08.840 --> 15:10.960
of Trump in general, especially the critiques

15:10.960 --> 15:12.160
that come from the left.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.680
Some of the better examples of this

15:13.680 --> 15:16.160
are in the Timcast IRL channel,

15:16.160 --> 15:18.200
where he has informal conversations with guests

15:18.200 --> 15:19.800
and happened to invite individuals

15:19.800 --> 15:21.220
who were to the left of him.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.920
In the first case, on October 27th, 2020,

15:23.920 --> 15:27.440
Tim spoke with YouTube political streaming personality, Bosch,

15:27.440 --> 15:30.060
when speaking about Trump's response to the COVID pandemic.

15:30.060 --> 15:32.880
Tim has a very strange defense of Trump's response.

15:32.880 --> 15:36.280
We know Trump was given information and then lied about it.

15:36.280 --> 15:37.760
And that's your opinion is?

15:37.760 --> 15:38.680
That's not an opinion.

15:38.680 --> 15:39.920
Yes, no, no, no, no, I'm saying,

15:39.920 --> 15:42.720
and your opinion is he shouldn't have,

15:42.720 --> 15:45.120
and mine is, I don't know,

15:45.120 --> 15:47.080
maybe there would have been a panic, maybe there wouldn't.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.600
I can't help but thank Tim's feelings

15:48.600 --> 15:51.040
on government officials lying to the American public

15:51.040 --> 15:53.360
has changed since this video came out.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.160
Here's an example from a video less than three months later.

15:56.160 --> 15:57.720
Anthony Fauci says, don't worry,

15:57.720 --> 15:58.960
we can accomplish herd immunity.

15:58.960 --> 16:00.560
And then he keeps moving the goalposts.

16:00.560 --> 16:01.840
So he was lying the whole time.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.200
That's authoritarianism.

16:03.200 --> 16:05.920
The idea that you're too stupid as an individual,

16:05.920 --> 16:07.160
that your rights don't matter

16:07.160 --> 16:09.560
and that we should withhold information from you

16:09.560 --> 16:11.400
because we're smarter than you.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.360
Tim hates lying now,

16:13.360 --> 16:15.080
or maybe it's only when someone

16:15.080 --> 16:16.720
other than Trump is doing it.

16:16.720 --> 16:18.560
And for the record, Fauci's reason

16:18.560 --> 16:21.200
for changing the required herd immunity projection

16:21.200 --> 16:23.120
was new scientific information

16:23.120 --> 16:24.600
and his message is being tailored

16:24.600 --> 16:26.960
to encourage as many Americans as possible

16:26.960 --> 16:28.400
to take the vaccine.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.880
It's a lot more complicated than branding Fauci a liar.

16:31.880 --> 16:34.240
Anyway, let's get back to the conversation with Vosch.

16:34.240 --> 16:36.920
What I'm trying to talk about is the totality of evidence

16:36.920 --> 16:38.520
that he has mishandled this pandemic.

16:38.520 --> 16:39.600
And it's interesting to me

16:39.600 --> 16:42.000
that you were extremely unwilling to criticize him for that.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.480
Because what's the alternative?

16:43.480 --> 16:44.320
The alternative.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.560
What would have happened in any other circumstance

16:46.560 --> 16:48.720
where we have no control group?

16:48.720 --> 16:49.800
What am I supposed to say?

16:49.800 --> 16:51.880
Well, the Trump would have backflip and saved a life.

16:51.880 --> 16:53.560
How many would have had to have died

16:53.560 --> 16:55.160
before you would criticize him?

16:56.080 --> 16:56.920
I don't know.

16:56.920 --> 16:57.760
Give me a number.

16:57.760 --> 16:58.600
We don't know.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.120
Wait, so you could have led a million?

17:00.120 --> 17:02.840
So what you're telling me is that we have no idea

17:02.840 --> 17:04.560
what would have happened if Trump did anything else.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.840
And now we're supposed to make a determination.

17:06.840 --> 17:08.120
The idea that you can't criticize

17:08.120 --> 17:10.080
the Trump administration response

17:10.080 --> 17:12.840
because we don't know for certain what the outcomes

17:12.840 --> 17:15.080
of other courses of actions would be

17:15.080 --> 17:17.480
deflates literally any criticism

17:17.480 --> 17:19.720
someone can have for a past action.

17:19.720 --> 17:21.680
And when Tim is confronted on this point,

17:21.680 --> 17:23.080
his response is to point out

17:23.080 --> 17:26.840
how he hasn't criticized Nancy Pelosi.

17:26.840 --> 17:29.200
You are taking the choice to defend Trump.

17:29.200 --> 17:30.760
You are the partisan here.

17:30.760 --> 17:33.080
You're not a distanced anti-authoritarian.

17:33.080 --> 17:34.520
You are standing with him.

17:34.520 --> 17:37.280
And you are saying, yes, I am anti-authoritarian.

17:37.280 --> 17:38.680
I am anti-establishment.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.600
But also, we don't know if him

17:40.600 --> 17:42.440
lying to the American people was bad.

17:42.440 --> 17:43.440
It could have caused a panic.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.080
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:45.080 --> 17:45.920
Can I make a video right now

17:45.920 --> 17:47.720
where I just scream about Nancy Pelosi

17:47.720 --> 17:48.640
causing all of the problems?

17:48.640 --> 17:49.480
I haven't done that.

17:49.480 --> 17:51.040
Although still strange,

17:51.040 --> 17:53.560
the idea that he's not trying to attack either side

17:53.560 --> 17:55.600
for the pandemic response,

17:55.600 --> 17:58.240
this would be a consistent line of reasoning

17:58.240 --> 18:01.280
if we hadn't heard Tim say this a few minutes earlier.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.800
We had several governors praise Trump for his response

18:03.800 --> 18:05.360
in, I think it was May.

18:05.360 --> 18:06.200
Look, look, look.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.680
A quarter of the deaths from COVID worldwide

18:08.680 --> 18:09.920
in a country with four percent.

18:09.920 --> 18:11.520
Nursing homes where the governors

18:11.520 --> 18:13.800
of Democrat controlled states put sick people killing.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.040
Wait, wait, wait, again, that's not good.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.920
I feel like we're engaging in what aboutism, right?

18:16.920 --> 18:19.720
We see that Tim is quite willing to blame Democrats

18:19.720 --> 18:22.200
when it comes to defending the Trump administration.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.120
But whenever Vosch had criticisms

18:24.120 --> 18:25.840
for the Democrats throughout the stream,

18:25.840 --> 18:28.360
Tim never felt the urge to balance out those

18:28.360 --> 18:29.680
with a critique of Trump

18:29.680 --> 18:32.720
or praising the Democrats in any way, shape, or form.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.640
To be fair, in this conversation,

18:34.640 --> 18:37.160
Tim lets criticism of Trump get some air

18:37.160 --> 18:38.960
and offers a few himself.

18:38.960 --> 18:42.280
I think Trump has very serious problems.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.800
I think he lies often.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.560
I think he's a blaggart.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.080
He boasts, he won't shut up.

18:47.080 --> 18:49.360
And I think most people know he's got a mouth

18:49.360 --> 18:53.000
that he couldn't stop blabbing to save his own campaign.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.720
I think he caused a lot of his own problems.

18:54.720 --> 18:57.520
And there is an actual really great argument

18:57.520 --> 18:59.680
that he should have been honest with the American people.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.840
On the hours upon hours of Tim Pool content,

19:02.840 --> 19:05.160
I watched to research this video.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.080
That clip was the hardest I saw him go on Donald Trump.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.240
We can see this behavior again in the conversation

19:11.240 --> 19:14.120
with another political streaming personality, Destiny,

19:14.120 --> 19:16.120
on December 3rd of the same year.

19:16.120 --> 19:17.320
And Bolivia, when he kept trying to recognize-

19:17.320 --> 19:18.280
Democrats did that too.

19:18.280 --> 19:19.120
Regardless-

19:19.120 --> 19:21.160
These conversations are especially revelatory

19:21.160 --> 19:23.040
as we see Tim is often unable to counter

19:23.040 --> 19:24.400
the arguments put against him

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
without digging into a rolodex of anecdotes

19:26.400 --> 19:28.680
he seems to have citing fringe stories

19:28.680 --> 19:30.200
and personal experiences,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.080
counting on the fact that his guest

19:32.080 --> 19:33.600
either hasn't heard of those stories

19:33.600 --> 19:35.240
or doesn't have personal experiences

19:35.240 --> 19:37.120
that run contrary to his.

19:37.120 --> 19:40.040
It's very difficult to present academic research,

19:40.040 --> 19:41.920
statistics, or other facts

19:41.920 --> 19:44.800
to only hear them countered by some strange anecdote

19:44.800 --> 19:46.120
you know few details of

19:46.120 --> 19:48.400
and are only hearing from a single source.

19:48.400 --> 19:50.720
And this is where Tim feels most comfortable,

19:50.720 --> 19:52.160
not only in these discussions,

19:52.160 --> 19:54.960
but all his videos thrive on this specific presentation

19:54.960 --> 19:58.600
of reoccurring oddball stories he repeats endlessly.

19:58.600 --> 19:59.880
And we can see what happens

19:59.960 --> 20:02.560
when one of Tim's faulty claims is checked in real time.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.880
He even said, we want to pressure you

20:04.880 --> 20:07.280
so that you can make memories.

20:07.280 --> 20:09.200
And do you remember when he said that, right?

20:09.200 --> 20:11.480
He said, we want you to, you know,

20:11.480 --> 20:13.320
when we pressure you this way,

20:13.320 --> 20:15.520
then you can form memories.

20:15.520 --> 20:17.360
I'm pretty sure exactly what he said was that

20:17.360 --> 20:18.200
when we pressure you,

20:18.200 --> 20:20.160
you're more likely to remember what actually happened

20:20.160 --> 20:21.000
is what he said.

20:21.000 --> 20:21.920
That under some pressure,

20:21.920 --> 20:23.520
the truth will come out or whatever it was.

20:23.520 --> 20:25.120
Ultimately, I think the argument is kind of pointless

20:25.120 --> 20:25.960
on this one guy. Sure.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.760
He moves on instantly.

20:27.760 --> 20:28.920
And before moving on myself,

20:28.920 --> 20:31.040
there's one comment I can't leave alone

20:31.040 --> 20:32.560
from these conversations.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.160
I was told in a matter of speaking to lie

20:35.160 --> 20:36.520
on more than one occasion,

20:36.520 --> 20:38.840
that if there is a certain bit of news reporting,

20:38.840 --> 20:40.920
that's true, but would be offensive to our audience.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.280
We don't report it.

20:42.280 --> 20:43.880
We side with the audience.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.280
That's what I was told to do.

20:45.280 --> 20:46.920
Can you give me like a, not a specific example,

20:46.920 --> 20:48.200
but like, what's like a general example of that?

20:48.200 --> 20:49.040
What do you mean by that?

20:49.040 --> 20:50.520
Let's say there's two guys in the street,

20:50.520 --> 20:51.760
Proud Boy and Antifa.

20:51.760 --> 20:56.040
And Antifa walks up and punches the Proud Boy in the face.

20:56.040 --> 20:58.840
If I reported that Antifa punched a Proud Boy in the face,

20:59.640 --> 21:00.480
that would be offensive to our audience.

21:00.480 --> 21:01.320
We don't report it.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.240
We have to side with the audience,

21:02.240 --> 21:04.360
which means when the Proud Boy got back up

21:04.360 --> 21:06.560
and punched Antifa back, that's what we report.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.520
To hear this criticism from Tim,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.840
who so fiercely sides with his own audience

21:10.840 --> 21:14.480
and their absolute love of Trump is ridiculous.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.800
Not that Tim acknowledges the pro-Trump elements

21:16.800 --> 21:19.200
in his audience, as we can see here.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.320
With this audience, I noticed,

21:20.320 --> 21:21.320
I don't want to be too general,

21:21.320 --> 21:23.760
but when I start to dump on Trump,

21:23.760 --> 21:25.080
if I just start to insult him,

21:25.080 --> 21:27.600
people get really angry at the other stuff I say

21:27.600 --> 21:28.880
in the conversation.

21:28.880 --> 21:32.440
If I don't trash Trump, I've noticed it, a trend,

21:32.440 --> 21:34.400
because a lot of people that watch this show

21:34.400 --> 21:35.920
seem to love him.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.480
Well, you're looking at the comments.

21:37.480 --> 21:39.760
I look at the comments, I'm talking about the text comments.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.000
Yup, that's why a lot of the comments

21:41.000 --> 21:43.880
are making fun of me quite a bit as well, especially now.

21:43.880 --> 21:45.880
The idea that comments under his videos,

21:45.880 --> 21:47.520
highly voted up ones no less,

21:47.520 --> 21:50.000
are somehow not representative of his audience

21:50.000 --> 21:51.440
is ridiculous.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.600
His claim of controversy driving their popularity

21:53.600 --> 21:54.760
is misleading.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.080
And all of this brings me to the reason

21:57.080 --> 21:59.080
I wanted to make this video in the first place.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.600
I got a bit annoyed when I saw Tim Pool

22:01.600 --> 22:06.600
starting to produce videos that promote vaccine skepticism.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.200
Let's quote one thing out of the way,

22:08.200 --> 22:09.040
he said,

22:09.040 --> 22:09.880
he said,

22:09.880 --> 22:10.720
he said,

22:10.720 --> 22:11.560
he said,

22:11.560 --> 22:12.400
he said,

22:12.400 --> 22:13.240
he said,

22:13.240 --> 22:14.080
he said,

22:14.080 --> 22:14.920
he said,

22:14.920 --> 22:15.760
he said,

22:15.760 --> 22:16.600
he said,

22:16.600 --> 22:17.400
he said,

22:17.400 --> 22:18.240
he said,

22:18.240 --> 22:19.080
he said,

22:19.080 --> 22:19.920
he said,

22:19.920 --> 22:20.760
he said,

22:20.760 --> 22:21.600
he said,

22:21.600 --> 22:22.440
he said,

22:22.440 --> 22:23.280
he said,

22:23.280 --> 22:24.120
he said,

22:24.960 --> 22:26.040
right off the bat.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.400
It would be wrong to call Tim an anti-vaxxer,

22:29.400 --> 22:31.320
and he quite clearly states he thinks

22:31.320 --> 22:33.800
there's probably nothing wrong with taking any vaccine

22:33.800 --> 22:35.840
for the COVID-19 virus.

22:35.840 --> 22:36.680
But,

22:36.680 --> 22:38.280
and if you were paying attention in this video,

22:38.280 --> 22:39.500
you knew there would be a but,

22:39.500 --> 22:41.760
Tim is quite willing to play into the paranoia

22:41.760 --> 22:42.880
around the vaccine,

22:42.880 --> 22:44.580
including using techniques

22:44.580 --> 22:46.820
that are common among anti-vaxxers.

22:46.820 --> 22:49.400
In the December 17th, 2020 video titled,

22:49.400 --> 22:51.680
Viral Video Shows Nurse Vaccination Syringe

22:51.680 --> 22:52.900
was empty.

22:52.900 --> 22:57.020
Media is the cause of vaccine fear mongering.

22:57.020 --> 22:59.340
I think the mainstream media,

22:59.340 --> 23:01.600
these news outlets are trying to freak us out

23:01.600 --> 23:02.440
about the vaccine.

23:02.440 --> 23:03.400
I mean it.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.080
Tim is supposedly calling out the media

23:05.080 --> 23:07.500
for creating skepticism about the vaccine.

23:07.500 --> 23:11.020
Ironically, this is something he does in this very video.

23:11.020 --> 23:14.200
Look, you have these PR events or whatever.

23:14.200 --> 23:15.980
We don't need them.

23:15.980 --> 23:18.120
It's the weirdest thing to me.

23:18.120 --> 23:19.680
We have flu shots every year.

23:19.680 --> 23:21.080
You tell people there's a flu shot,

23:21.080 --> 23:22.600
have at it, we don't care.

23:22.640 --> 23:26.320
The fact that Tim compares this to getting the flu shot

23:26.320 --> 23:28.400
as if millions of people haven't had their lives

23:28.400 --> 23:30.400
completely changed by this pandemic

23:30.400 --> 23:32.360
demonstrates how he really likes to

23:32.360 --> 23:34.920
downplay the impact this virus is having.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.920
It's sort of true whenever he talks about the pandemic.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.700
He never mentions that the virus itself is dangerous.

23:39.700 --> 23:43.920
He mostly gets angry at lockdowns or dancing nurses.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.960
I look at that and I get angry.

23:45.960 --> 23:47.600
The first bit of evidence Tim shows us

23:47.600 --> 23:49.640
is a news story from El Paso

23:49.640 --> 23:51.760
about a local news report showing a nurse

23:51.760 --> 23:53.360
receiving the vaccine,

23:53.360 --> 23:55.320
but it appears the syringes plunger

23:55.320 --> 23:56.860
had already been pushed in.

23:56.860 --> 23:58.200
An event that, by the way,

23:58.200 --> 24:00.480
had five different people receive the vaccine.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.560
Why this story is getting any kind of coverage

24:03.560 --> 24:05.080
is kind of weird.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.640
There are hundreds of these stories out there,

24:06.640 --> 24:08.620
especially on local news channels.

24:08.620 --> 24:10.820
They want to present some positive developments

24:10.820 --> 24:12.760
on this year-long pandemic.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.280
This non-story got traction

24:14.280 --> 24:16.920
because it was spread on social media as suspect.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.720
Even if the event had been botched,

24:18.720 --> 24:21.400
this speaks less to the efficacy of the vaccine

24:21.400 --> 24:23.300
and more to the people who set up this event.

24:23.300 --> 24:26.200
The dude literally did not receive a vaccine.

24:26.200 --> 24:29.400
I'm casting the PR event in a negative light.

24:29.400 --> 24:31.240
Oh, hey, Tim, got this one right.

24:31.240 --> 24:34.520
And he wants to assure people that the vaccine is fine.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.360
But there's always a but, isn't there?

24:37.360 --> 24:39.320
This is the illusion of nuance

24:39.320 --> 24:41.840
Tim loves to introduce to his audience.

24:41.840 --> 24:42.880
But there can be side effects.

24:42.880 --> 24:45.520
That's a fact, and you really should understand.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.540
Here's an example of him providing

24:47.540 --> 24:50.560
supposedly reasonable concerns about the vaccine.

24:50.560 --> 24:53.360
There have been people who developed Bell's Palsy

24:53.360 --> 24:55.760
after getting the vaccine.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.880
They're saying, but it's not any different

24:57.880 --> 25:02.040
than the natural statistics on people getting Bell's Palsy.

25:02.040 --> 25:04.480
The issue is there's still the correlation.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.000
There is no issue though.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.200
For the 43,000 people who received the Pfizer vaccine,

25:09.200 --> 25:10.880
four developed Bell's Palsy.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.920
And of the 30,000 in the Moderna group,

25:12.920 --> 25:15.800
three reported some degree of facial paralysis,

25:15.800 --> 25:17.320
a symptom of Bell's Palsy.

25:17.320 --> 25:19.400
The standard rate of developing some kind

25:19.400 --> 25:22.240
of partial facial paralysis within the United States

25:22.240 --> 25:23.520
is one in 10,000.

25:23.520 --> 25:25.960
In other words, when Tim says there's a correlation

25:25.960 --> 25:29.080
between receiving the vaccine and developing Bell's Palsy,

25:29.080 --> 25:30.360
that isn't true.

25:30.360 --> 25:33.200
A correlation would require the incidence

25:33.200 --> 25:36.160
of partial facial paralysis to go up

25:36.160 --> 25:37.360
after receiving the vaccine.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.320
But since it stays the same,

25:39.320 --> 25:42.040
there is no evidence of a correlation.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.240
But I'm not a medical expert.

25:44.240 --> 25:46.280
My basic understanding of math aside,

25:46.280 --> 25:48.400
let's see what a medical expert says.

25:48.440 --> 25:50.600
Here's a quote from Dr. Irene Kim,

25:50.600 --> 25:52.680
assistant professor of head and neck surgery

25:52.680 --> 25:54.800
and director of the Facial Nerve Center

25:54.800 --> 25:58.640
in the Division of Facial Plastic Surgery at UCLA,

25:58.640 --> 26:00.880
who echoes the FDA when she says,

26:00.880 --> 26:03.040
the information we have is insufficient to say

26:03.040 --> 26:04.760
that there is a causal relationship

26:04.760 --> 26:06.960
between Bell's Palsy and the vaccine.

26:06.960 --> 26:08.040
Back to Tim's video.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.680
He overstates another side effect

26:09.680 --> 26:12.600
when talking about anaphylaxis.

26:12.600 --> 26:16.160
I believe anaphylaxis was a point,

26:16.160 --> 26:19.840
I think it was a 0.685% probability.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.280
So that's like one in 160 or so.

26:23.280 --> 26:26.240
I'm not sure where he got the specific figure from.

26:26.240 --> 26:27.400
When he tweeted about this,

26:27.400 --> 26:30.080
he included a link to a Euronews article,

26:30.080 --> 26:34.560
though the 0.685% number is nowhere to be found.

26:34.560 --> 26:38.000
I suspect Tim is getting this rate of 0.685%

26:38.000 --> 26:43.000
from the Pfizer study in which 0.63% of the 22,000 people

26:43.360 --> 26:46.720
who received the vaccine reported hypersensitivity-related

26:46.720 --> 26:49.600
adverse effects compared to the 0.51%

26:49.600 --> 26:50.880
who received the placebo.

26:50.880 --> 26:53.920
Most importantly, Pfizer said there were no cases

26:53.920 --> 26:55.360
of anaphylaxis.

26:55.360 --> 26:57.800
And to clarify what anaphylaxis is,

26:57.800 --> 26:59.960
one definition I found describes it as,

26:59.960 --> 27:03.200
a serious life-threatening allergic reaction.

27:03.200 --> 27:06.160
This is the most serious type of allergic reaction

27:06.160 --> 27:09.280
a person can get, and if you don't have an EpiPen

27:09.280 --> 27:12.120
or something nearby, you can quite easily die.

27:12.120 --> 27:16.360
Tim saying that one in 160 people who get the vaccine

27:16.360 --> 27:20.160
will get anaphylaxis is completely absurd

27:20.160 --> 27:22.440
and dangerously misleading.

27:22.440 --> 27:26.400
Why can't we have a regular conversation about this?

27:26.400 --> 27:27.720
There are side effects.

27:27.720 --> 27:29.480
It shouldn't be mandatory.

27:29.480 --> 27:30.840
How simple is that?

27:30.840 --> 27:32.840
Although Tim calls himself pro-vaccine,

27:32.840 --> 27:34.680
overstating the side effects of vaccines

27:34.680 --> 27:36.840
is a common tactic of anti-vaxxers.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.760
Though the bigger point he makes in this video

27:38.760 --> 27:41.680
is a libertarian-esque rant about how important it is

27:41.680 --> 27:43.520
to have the choice on whether or not

27:43.520 --> 27:45.560
to receive the vaccine, which is the real point

27:45.560 --> 27:48.120
of this video, so he can say this.

27:48.120 --> 27:51.600
Why is it that for years we can have people say things

27:51.600 --> 27:52.440
like, I can't remember who it was,

27:52.440 --> 27:53.800
there was some celebrity lady,

27:53.800 --> 27:56.520
and she said, not in any way anti-vax,

27:56.520 --> 27:58.200
just think people should have a choice

27:58.200 --> 28:00.000
as to whether or not that they get vaccinated,

28:00.000 --> 28:01.680
and they called her an anti-vaxxer.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.600
The funny thing about this freedom argument

28:03.600 --> 28:06.440
is that it's one that's been used by anti-vaxxers

28:06.440 --> 28:08.240
going back over 100 years.

28:08.240 --> 28:11.440
Here's an image from a pamphlet from 1885

28:11.440 --> 28:15.160
talking about the supposed dangers of the smallpox vaccine.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.160
You can see this echoed today with fear-mongering

28:17.160 --> 28:20.400
about Bill Gates using vaccines to usher in a new world order

28:20.400 --> 28:22.840
and that mandatory vaccines to have access

28:22.840 --> 28:25.320
to public services, like public schools,

28:25.320 --> 28:27.520
is taking away people's freedoms.

28:27.520 --> 28:30.640
Tim's paranoia here is of the more mild sort,

28:30.640 --> 28:33.280
where he fears every small business will be shut down

28:33.280 --> 28:35.360
and people will be forced to get vaccinations

28:35.360 --> 28:38.720
to shop at Walmart, something that seems unlikely.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.760
He also talks about how he thinks people

28:40.760 --> 28:42.560
should have the choice to homeschool their kids,

28:42.560 --> 28:44.160
which, last I checked,

28:44.160 --> 28:46.560
wasn't being outlawed in the United States.

28:46.560 --> 28:48.880
And that's Tim's content all over.

28:48.880 --> 28:51.240
He presents a reasonable take on vaccine

28:51.240 --> 28:54.080
but pairs it with some subtle fear-mongering,

28:54.080 --> 28:56.600
all the while taking potshots at the media.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.680
Here's an example of how he projects anti-vaxx

28:58.680 --> 29:01.920
talking points into the mouths of media figures.

29:01.920 --> 29:04.560
This dude goes on TV

29:04.560 --> 29:07.440
and says probably one of the stupidest things

29:07.440 --> 29:09.840
I think anyone could have even said.

29:09.840 --> 29:11.400
You know what, but maybe I'm wrong.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.400
Maybe he's just being honest.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.560
He said something to the effect of,

29:15.560 --> 29:18.480
even if you get the vaccine, you can still get COVID.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.600
You can still get infected and you can still spread it.

29:20.600 --> 29:21.960
So you gotta wear your mask.

29:21.960 --> 29:22.800
You can't travel.

29:22.800 --> 29:23.640
It's a misconception.

29:23.640 --> 29:24.840
Wait, wait, wait, what?

29:26.160 --> 29:28.120
Is this serious?

29:28.120 --> 29:31.320
Tim refuses to do even the most basic research

29:31.320 --> 29:32.880
on what the vaccine does.

29:32.880 --> 29:35.000
The function of this vaccine is to prevent

29:35.000 --> 29:37.080
the most serious symptoms of COVID,

29:37.080 --> 29:39.160
symptoms that have killed hundreds of thousands

29:39.160 --> 29:40.720
of people around the world.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.120
What's unknown is how effective, if at all,

29:43.120 --> 29:46.040
it will be in reducing the transmission of the virus.

29:46.040 --> 29:47.640
So until herd immunity is reached,

29:47.640 --> 29:49.600
it's important to maintain social distancing,

29:49.600 --> 29:51.400
mask wearing, and limited travel.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.440
This is not the same as saying

29:52.440 --> 29:54.960
the vaccine doesn't work at all.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.960
But instead of doing research to clarify

29:56.960 --> 29:59.280
this Twitter comment, Tim would sooner pretend

29:59.280 --> 30:01.160
someone in the media is saying the vaccine

30:01.160 --> 30:03.560
just doesn't work, which gives him

30:03.560 --> 30:05.640
the perfect excuse to say this.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.320
So many people thought it was impossible.

30:07.320 --> 30:08.320
Guess what?

30:08.320 --> 30:10.160
Maybe it was.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.120
Maybe this is the trial.

30:12.120 --> 30:13.880
Like, we're desperate.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.160
We got a lockdown.

30:15.160 --> 30:16.160
People are scared.

30:16.160 --> 30:19.280
Not conservatives, you know, but the left.

30:19.280 --> 30:23.440
And so they brushed this out.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.280
And it's as simple as that.

30:26.280 --> 30:28.720
This is not the nuanced perspective

30:28.720 --> 30:31.080
about the vaccine it pretends to be.

30:31.080 --> 30:34.320
It certainly isn't full-on anti-vax content

30:34.320 --> 30:36.180
the same way his pro-Trump videos

30:36.180 --> 30:38.300
aren't full-on MAGA content.

30:38.300 --> 30:41.420
It's a slightly more nuanced and restrained take.

30:41.420 --> 30:43.700
But ultimately, it's pushing his audience

30:43.700 --> 30:45.900
in the same direction, to be more skeptical

30:45.900 --> 30:48.540
of the vaccine and to be more supportive of Trump.

30:48.540 --> 30:50.300
One of the most reasonable things Tim says

30:50.300 --> 30:52.900
in this video is that people should trust their doctors.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.480
Advice I wholeheartedly support.

30:55.480 --> 30:58.220
Does Tim ever wonder why he has highly upvoted

30:58.220 --> 31:00.620
comments like these under his video?

31:00.620 --> 31:02.380
Not getting vaccine.

31:02.380 --> 31:04.100
I'm not anti-vax.

31:04.100 --> 31:07.020
I'm just not interested in being a guinea pig.

31:07.020 --> 31:10.780
10 you years from now, there will be ads on TV.

31:10.780 --> 31:12.320
Did you get COVID vaccine?

31:12.320 --> 31:14.960
Join class action lawsuit today.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.280
Don't you trust your doctors?

31:17.280 --> 31:19.600
Um, no.

31:19.600 --> 31:24.600
99.9% survival rate versus 2% severe side effects

31:24.600 --> 31:28.120
with a 95% efficacy rate?

31:28.120 --> 31:31.280
You decide which odds you're willing to take.

31:31.280 --> 31:33.280
If this video was intended to reduce

31:33.280 --> 31:36.720
people's fear of the vaccine, it obviously isn't working.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.840
If anything, it's having the exact opposite effect.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.020
And the cherry on top is how he turns this video

31:42.020 --> 31:45.400
into another chance to defend Donald Trump.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.680
I think these news outlets really want to undermine

31:48.680 --> 31:50.640
our faith in the vaccine.

31:50.640 --> 31:53.300
And a lot of people think the vaccine isn't safe,

31:53.300 --> 31:55.280
but I'll tell you what, you wanna know

31:55.280 --> 31:57.000
why I think they like doing this?

31:57.000 --> 31:59.480
They hate Donald Trump.

31:59.480 --> 32:02.080
Warp speed was Trump's initiative.

32:02.080 --> 32:04.520
It worked, the vaccine came out.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.540
Everyone's happy about it.

32:06.540 --> 32:08.380
Because it wouldn't be a Tim Pool video

32:08.380 --> 32:11.980
without another hit of that pro-Trump copium.

32:11.980 --> 32:15.340
Taken on their own, very few single Tim Pool videos

32:15.340 --> 32:16.820
are especially bad.

32:16.820 --> 32:19.820
And what Tim's prolific amount of videos

32:19.820 --> 32:22.100
create a media environment for his viewers

32:22.100 --> 32:23.620
that keeps them happy.

32:23.620 --> 32:26.200
And Tim has a tendency to speak out of both sides

32:26.200 --> 32:28.380
of his mouth to the point of parody.

32:28.380 --> 32:29.820
Far be it from me to question

32:29.820 --> 32:32.060
an actual legal expert on this.

32:32.060 --> 32:32.900
For sure.

32:32.900 --> 32:35.180
10 seconds later.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.580
But I have to question what he's saying.

32:37.580 --> 32:39.380
And a clip like that encapsulates

32:39.380 --> 32:41.960
one of the many problems with Tim Pool's content.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.540
He speaks on topics he knows very little about

32:44.540 --> 32:47.220
and the things he knows he often misrepresents.

32:47.220 --> 32:49.260
Tim Pool's videos make his audience

32:49.260 --> 32:51.420
more ignorant about the world.

32:51.420 --> 32:53.260
This isn't my first Tim Pool video.

32:53.260 --> 32:55.020
I focused on him specifically

32:55.020 --> 32:56.700
and three other videos on this channel

32:56.700 --> 32:59.180
and mentioned him in passing a few other times.

32:59.180 --> 33:01.580
In my previous videos, one of the major failures

33:01.580 --> 33:03.900
I think I had was not taking the time

33:03.900 --> 33:07.900
to also discuss how deeply unimportant he is as a person.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.860
While the comments making fun of his hat,

33:09.860 --> 33:12.100
his manner of speaking, and his intelligence

33:12.100 --> 33:13.700
might be fun for a laugh,

33:13.700 --> 33:15.060
and I've probably had a few less

33:15.060 --> 33:17.060
at the guy's expense in this very video,

33:17.060 --> 33:18.960
I think it's important to stress that

33:18.960 --> 33:22.020
if Tim decided that tomorrow he would stop making videos

33:22.020 --> 33:23.660
and retire to the wilderness,

33:23.660 --> 33:26.820
this would not be the end of terrible news analysis

33:26.820 --> 33:27.820
on YouTube.

33:27.820 --> 33:30.060
Another person would rise to fill the beanie

33:30.060 --> 33:32.800
and YouTube has no shortage of loudmouth commentators

33:32.800 --> 33:35.000
ready to spoon feed their audience trash

33:35.000 --> 33:36.160
and tell them it's news,

33:36.160 --> 33:38.700
and this is true across the political spectrum.

33:38.700 --> 33:40.360
What I hope this video does is highlight

33:40.360 --> 33:42.040
some of the techniques to watch out for,

33:42.040 --> 33:43.500
the repeated use of sources

33:43.500 --> 33:45.520
from one side of the political spectrum,

33:45.520 --> 33:47.480
the embarrassingly wrong predictions,

33:47.480 --> 33:50.960
and the absolute refusal to criticize certain politicians.

33:50.960 --> 33:53.080
There's no easy way to spot these people,

33:53.080 --> 33:55.920
but here are a few tips I found personally helpful.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.880
If a single person or small team

33:57.880 --> 34:00.600
are producing huge volumes of content,

34:00.600 --> 34:03.320
commenting on a wide number of issues,

34:03.320 --> 34:05.280
the odds are good that they don't know nearly enough

34:05.280 --> 34:07.960
to be covering such a wide array of topics.

34:07.960 --> 34:09.480
If someone says they're giving you news

34:09.480 --> 34:10.480
right down the middle

34:10.480 --> 34:12.680
and their comment section is filled with partisans

34:12.680 --> 34:14.120
for one political side,

34:14.120 --> 34:16.980
the news you're getting probably isn't neutral.

34:16.980 --> 34:19.200
Don't let someone extrapolate anecdotes

34:19.200 --> 34:20.720
into broader social trends,

34:20.720 --> 34:22.080
demand numbers or research

34:22.080 --> 34:24.100
before believing anyone who makes comments

34:24.100 --> 34:26.600
about entire nations or groups of people,

34:26.600 --> 34:28.900
and be wary of small anecdotes

34:28.900 --> 34:31.100
and stories that can't be falsified.

34:31.100 --> 34:32.380
If someone tells you a story

34:32.380 --> 34:34.500
from their personal experience

34:34.500 --> 34:36.020
or an obscure news event

34:36.020 --> 34:38.380
that may have only been covered by a few sources,

34:38.380 --> 34:41.300
be very wary of anything they tell you next

34:41.300 --> 34:42.500
because often there's no way

34:42.500 --> 34:44.820
to fact check any of these stories.

34:44.820 --> 34:47.600
This person could just as easily make up anything

34:47.600 --> 34:49.900
that some random friend told them

34:49.900 --> 34:51.180
or use a one-off event

34:51.180 --> 34:54.300
that isn't representative of anything.

34:54.300 --> 34:56.680
They may not even be doing this to deceive you.

34:56.680 --> 34:58.460
It could just be a simple misunderstanding

34:58.540 --> 34:59.780
of how the news works.

34:59.780 --> 35:01.780
You can't understand the world at large

35:01.780 --> 35:04.140
by talking to your buddy down the street.

35:04.140 --> 35:05.940
You actually have to do some work.

35:05.940 --> 35:07.960
And if you're the sort of person who has some time,

35:07.960 --> 35:10.300
try fact checking a few random videos.

35:10.300 --> 35:13.500
If someone can be shown to be consistently wrong,

35:13.500 --> 35:16.140
they're probably not worth listening to.

35:16.140 --> 35:19.080
And credits roll, end of YouTube video.

35:20.460 --> 35:21.340
Or that was the plan

35:21.340 --> 35:23.700
before an angry mob of Trump supporters

35:23.700 --> 35:24.940
broke into the US Capitol

35:24.940 --> 35:27.660
to stop accounting of electoral college votes.

35:27.660 --> 35:30.460
Details are still hazy so early into this event,

35:30.460 --> 35:32.420
but this video would be incomplete

35:32.420 --> 35:34.900
if I didn't make a few connections here.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.260
To describe the events as neutral as I can,

35:37.260 --> 35:39.820
President Trump staged a rally in Washington DC

35:39.820 --> 35:42.660
on January 6th, making his case to his supporters

35:42.660 --> 35:45.340
that the recent federal election was illegitimate.

35:45.340 --> 35:47.020
This follows two months of claiming

35:47.020 --> 35:49.220
the election has been illegitimate.

35:49.220 --> 35:53.420
We're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue.

35:53.420 --> 35:55.380
I love Pennsylvania Avenue.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.120
And we're going to the Capitol.

35:57.440 --> 35:58.280
Following the speech,

35:58.280 --> 36:00.440
his supporters marched on the Capitol building

36:00.440 --> 36:03.160
where the certified election results were being counted.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.520
Security at the building was quickly bypassed

36:05.520 --> 36:08.320
and there were several acts of vandalism and theft.

36:08.320 --> 36:10.020
The counting of the results was halted.

36:10.020 --> 36:12.160
Elected officials were escorted to safety

36:12.160 --> 36:14.480
and eventually several arrests were made.

36:14.480 --> 36:16.420
Eventually the building was cleared,

36:16.420 --> 36:18.440
the counting of the votes was resumed

36:18.440 --> 36:22.680
and Joe Biden was declared the president-elect.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.160
These are the events that occurred,

36:24.160 --> 36:25.320
but what's really important

36:25.360 --> 36:27.560
is how people consume commentary about them,

36:27.560 --> 36:29.240
which will affect how we understand them

36:29.240 --> 36:31.160
in a broader context.

36:31.160 --> 36:34.140
I spent a lot of time in this video talking about Tim Poole,

36:34.140 --> 36:37.520
but he's just a case study for a much larger problem.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.800
There's a right-wing echo chamber that reaches all the way

36:39.800 --> 36:41.400
from the lowliest of grifters

36:41.400 --> 36:44.400
to the highest offices around the world.

36:44.400 --> 36:48.120
For example, when Representative Matt Gaetz said this.

36:48.120 --> 36:50.480
And I don't know if the reports are true,

36:50.480 --> 36:53.760
but the Washington Times has just reported

36:53.760 --> 36:55.280
some pretty compelling evidence

36:55.280 --> 36:57.660
from a facial recognition company

36:57.660 --> 36:58.840
showing that some of the people

36:58.840 --> 37:02.760
who breached the Capitol today were not Trump supporters.

37:02.760 --> 37:05.100
They were masquerading as Trump supporters

37:05.100 --> 37:06.960
and in fact were members

37:06.960 --> 37:10.320
of the violent terrorist group Antifa.

37:10.320 --> 37:13.120
Here he's amplifying a story that had been discredited

37:13.120 --> 37:14.440
from the Washington Times,

37:14.440 --> 37:16.120
a right-wing outlet with a long history

37:16.120 --> 37:17.400
of distorting the news.

37:17.400 --> 37:19.960
The story was so incredibly false

37:19.960 --> 37:22.280
it had to be heavily edited after the fact.

37:22.280 --> 37:24.800
Of course, after the fact is after it was repeated

37:24.800 --> 37:27.160
by a politician in an official hearing.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.440
And if we look at Tucker Carlson,

37:28.440 --> 37:30.600
we can see an example of something similar.

37:31.560 --> 37:34.260
Millions of Americans sincerely believe

37:34.260 --> 37:36.960
the last election was fake.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.880
You can dismiss them as crazy.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.640
You can call them conspiracy theorists.

37:40.640 --> 37:42.220
You can kick them off Twitter.

37:43.440 --> 37:45.620
But that won't change their minds.

37:45.620 --> 37:47.800
Rather than trying to change their minds

37:47.800 --> 37:49.720
to convince them and reassure them

37:49.720 --> 37:52.120
that the system is real, that the democracy work,

37:52.120 --> 37:54.360
as you would do if you cared about the country

37:54.360 --> 37:56.120
or the people who live here,

37:56.120 --> 37:58.800
our new leaders will try to silence them.

37:58.800 --> 38:01.160
Tucker acknowledges the angry mob is right-wing,

38:01.160 --> 38:03.400
but he not only presents them as more legitimate

38:03.400 --> 38:05.240
to any left-wing demonstrators,

38:05.240 --> 38:08.760
but he also justifies the anger felt within the mob.

38:08.760 --> 38:12.240
To me, it seems obvious that these people were stirred up

38:12.240 --> 38:15.800
by claims that the election was fraudulent or invalid,

38:15.800 --> 38:18.000
claims that had been coming from the mouth of the president

38:18.000 --> 38:19.620
and his supporters for months.

38:19.620 --> 38:20.840
We shouldn't be surprised that people

38:20.840 --> 38:23.640
who were repeating these claims are so quick to try

38:23.640 --> 38:25.800
and cause confusion around this event.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.120
We need to call moments like these what they are,

38:28.120 --> 38:31.120
a desperate attempt to rewrite reality in front of our eyes,

38:31.120 --> 38:33.880
the invention of conspiracy theories and rationalizations

38:33.880 --> 38:35.840
that shift blame away from the harmful rhetoric

38:35.840 --> 38:37.320
these people employ.

38:37.320 --> 38:38.880
This isn't about presenting the truth.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.400
It's about finding a version of events

38:40.400 --> 38:43.320
that can be politically capitalized on by the far right

38:43.320 --> 38:45.360
so they can seize more power.

38:45.360 --> 38:49.020
Whether he knows it or not, Tim is part of this machine.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.860
I don't particularly care if he's a cynical grifter

38:51.860 --> 38:52.980
or a useful idiot.

38:52.980 --> 38:55.760
The point is he endlessly produces content

38:55.760 --> 38:58.540
that attacks the left while excusing the excesses

38:58.540 --> 38:59.380
of the right.

38:59.380 --> 39:01.660
We can see that pretty clearly from his reaction

39:01.660 --> 39:03.380
to the events on January 6th.

39:03.380 --> 39:05.880
He's very quick to assign blame for the events

39:05.880 --> 39:09.100
to the left, the media, and he offers a rationalization

39:09.100 --> 39:11.660
for his role in all of this as well.

39:11.660 --> 39:13.700
Let me tell you the difference between me and Jake Tapper.

39:13.700 --> 39:15.500
I should say for the most part, CNN.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.820
I have condemned all the violence,

39:19.460 --> 39:21.260
I'm not gonna pretend to be a psychic

39:21.260 --> 39:22.740
who can see the future.

39:22.740 --> 39:25.060
But when I predicted this over and over again,

39:25.060 --> 39:28.020
telling you what I'm seeing and what I think will happen,

39:28.020 --> 39:29.940
well, then they blame me.

39:29.940 --> 39:34.420
They say, it's your fault, my fault, that I warned you

39:34.420 --> 39:38.660
and I told you what needed to be done to prevent this.

39:38.660 --> 39:40.220
How insane.

39:40.220 --> 39:42.060
I hope the earlier sections of this video

39:42.060 --> 39:44.140
help portray a criticism of Tim's content

39:44.140 --> 39:45.860
in a way that he doesn't acknowledge.

39:45.860 --> 39:47.620
Condemning violence is fine,

39:47.660 --> 39:50.240
but it doesn't absolve him from devoting so much of his time

39:50.240 --> 39:52.620
to entertaining the delusions of Trump supporters.

39:52.620 --> 39:54.380
Whether it's encouraging their fantasies

39:54.380 --> 39:55.660
of overturning the election

39:55.660 --> 39:57.920
or stoking paranoia about vaccines,

39:57.920 --> 40:00.460
Tim Poole's content twists the news of the day

40:00.460 --> 40:01.660
into right-wing narratives,

40:01.660 --> 40:04.800
letting them live in the world of alternative facts.

40:04.800 --> 40:07.260
These Trump supporters have been fed a constant diet

40:07.260 --> 40:09.100
of misinformation about the election

40:09.100 --> 40:11.600
and misinformation about the world for some time.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.780
Tim is constantly hammering on the point

40:13.780 --> 40:16.540
that back in June, Chris Cuomo on CNN said

40:16.540 --> 40:18.860
that protests don't have to be peaceful

40:18.860 --> 40:20.900
as if this was a major contributing factor

40:20.900 --> 40:22.620
in inflaming tensions.

40:22.620 --> 40:26.220
But how many Trump supporters are honestly watching CNN?

40:26.220 --> 40:29.260
I think they're more likely to be watching Steven Crowder

40:29.260 --> 40:30.980
or maybe they're listening to politicians

40:30.980 --> 40:33.700
like Rudy Giuliani at the very rally they were attending

40:33.700 --> 40:35.920
that day say things like this.

40:35.920 --> 40:41.100
Let's have trial by combat.

40:41.100 --> 40:42.860
Or maybe they were listening to Tim

40:42.860 --> 40:45.220
who puts out video after video

40:45.220 --> 40:48.100
warning people about an impending civil war.

40:48.100 --> 40:51.140
Someone is clearly feeding this audience

40:51.140 --> 40:52.920
misinformation and fear.

40:52.920 --> 40:54.620
And I don't think it's that cable station

40:54.620 --> 40:55.820
that none of them are watching.

40:55.820 --> 40:57.660
And I don't think it's any of the politicians

40:57.660 --> 40:59.620
they clearly don't support.

40:59.620 --> 41:01.500
It's the people in the media like him

41:01.500 --> 41:03.860
who are constructing these narratives for them.

41:03.860 --> 41:06.520
During his live stream on January 6th,

41:06.520 --> 41:09.260
Tim had on a panel of voices largely doing

41:09.260 --> 41:10.820
what he always does on his channel,

41:10.820 --> 41:12.300
attack the left and the media

41:12.300 --> 41:14.260
and play defense for Donald Trump.

41:14.280 --> 41:17.020
But during the live stream, YouTube had to censor his chat

41:17.020 --> 41:19.440
for frequent incitements to violence.

41:19.440 --> 41:23.280
So what I'm being told is that,

41:23.280 --> 41:24.780
for those that are just tuning in,

41:24.780 --> 41:27.900
chat has been disabled because people in comments

41:27.900 --> 41:30.100
are inciting violence, calling for more

41:30.100 --> 41:30.980
and things like that.

41:30.980 --> 41:33.180
Tim was cognizant enough not to complain too much,

41:33.180 --> 41:34.900
incitements to violence are obviously

41:34.900 --> 41:36.420
against YouTube's rules.

41:36.420 --> 41:38.260
But is it really surprising to him

41:38.260 --> 41:40.000
that so many people in his audience

41:40.000 --> 41:42.380
are frothing at the mouth for this?

41:42.380 --> 41:44.980
The comments under his videos tell the same story.

41:44.980 --> 41:48.620
Tim's content attracts a right-wing audience for a reason.

41:48.620 --> 41:49.940
It gives them a vision of a world

41:49.940 --> 41:51.660
that validates their feelings.

41:51.660 --> 41:54.200
It validates all the rage and fear they feel

41:54.200 --> 41:56.360
about the world around them.

41:56.360 --> 41:59.580
The American writer Flannery O'Connor had a wonderful quote,

41:59.580 --> 42:02.940
"'The truth does not change according to our ability

42:02.940 --> 42:05.820
"'to stomach it emotionally.'"

42:05.820 --> 42:08.220
Tim's content isn't about delivering the truth

42:08.220 --> 42:09.380
to his audience.

42:09.380 --> 42:12.940
It's about giving them stories that let them avoid it.

42:12.940 --> 42:14.580
This was a tough video to make.

42:14.580 --> 42:16.420
Originally, it was just a quick check-in

42:16.420 --> 42:19.180
on the content of Tim Pool to make sure it's still awful

42:19.180 --> 42:21.460
because I thought we were kind of due for that.

42:21.460 --> 42:23.020
It got a bit away from me and ballooned

42:23.020 --> 42:24.180
into something much bigger.

42:24.180 --> 42:26.460
And then the events of January 6th happened

42:26.460 --> 42:30.280
and I needed to add more to it still.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.700
Much thanks goes out to Tim Pool Clips

42:32.700 --> 42:35.660
who helped me with the earliest version of this video.

42:35.660 --> 42:37.300
He was a great resource.

42:37.300 --> 42:39.780
His links are all below in the description box.

42:39.780 --> 42:41.580
Also, thanks to Tim Bon Toast,

42:41.580 --> 42:45.300
he was very helpful in bouncing some ideas off of.

42:45.300 --> 42:47.300
I think he's got some stuff cooking about Tim Pool

42:47.300 --> 42:49.820
in the future, so take a look out for that.

42:49.820 --> 42:53.480
Thank you so much to all my patrons for being patient.

42:53.480 --> 42:56.900
Content has been a little slim on my channel lately,

42:56.900 --> 42:58.700
but I'm hoping to turn that around a little bit

42:58.700 --> 43:00.660
in the not too distant future.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.380
