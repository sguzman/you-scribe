1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
So, this video was not supposed to happen.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,480
I'm in the middle of a very big project.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:10,900
It's another deep dive into something you've probably heard of this time.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,740
But today I saw a video from Lauren Chen, and it just really pissed me off.

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,020
So here I am making a response video to it because there were so many factual errors

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,500
in it, so many ridiculous statements that I just couldn't help myself.

7
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,040
So let's dive into this video.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:34,000
It's titled Immigration Crisis, Take More Migrants Says UN.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
As Global News reports, quote, the United Nations is urging Canada to help ease Mexico's

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,200
refugee burden by helping resettle some of the most vulnerable of its new arrivals, including

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,480
women, children, and LGBTQ2 people.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,120
Mexico is feeling the squeeze from an unprecedented exodus of people fleeing Central American

13
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,120
countries.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,760
And some of the worst violence from nations not actually at war is forcing families northward.

15
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,720
Our pitch to Canada is to do more, said Mark Manley, the Mexico representative of the United

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,920
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,160
The article continues that the request comes as the United States takes a harder line on

18
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,140
its Mexican border, with President Donald Trump branding the caravans of migrants as

19
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:16,560
being laced with violent criminals bent on destabilizing his country.

20
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,080
Oh look, the first error.

21
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,800
We're not talking about migrants crossing borders here, we're talking about refugees

22
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,640
being resettled.

23
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
The way the refugee resettlement process works is that someone fleeing their country applies

24
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,240
for asylum.

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,240
And if they're granted asylum and given refugee status, they can then apply to be

26
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,320
moved somewhere else.

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,040
We're talking about people who have fled Central America to Mexico, applied for asylum,

28
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,960
been given refugee status, and then are being transferred over to Canada.

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,380
They shouldn't be considered vaguely defined migrants.

30
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,600
These are vetted refugees.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,540
Here's an example of the numbers Lauren Chen loves so much.

32
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,180
The ones that seem like they're arguing for her point, but when you actually dig

33
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:00,180
into them, don't really do that.

34
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,140
In 2018, under the leadership of Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party, Canada resettled more

35
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:08,980
refugees than any other country.

36
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:15,060
As the BBC reports, the country accepted just over 28,000 refugees last year, with the United

37
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,440
States coming in second with 22,900.

38
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,920
But to anyone who would ask Canada to do more, those numbers should tell you that we

39
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,520
have already done more than enough.

40
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,080
The reason Canada, the United States, and Australia rank so high for resettlement numbers

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,280
is because it's very difficult for refugees to get here.

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,440
They'd basically have to swim across the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean just to get to Canada.

43
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,800
So generally, they don't have to worry about a lot of refugees showing up at their borders.

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,400
If we look at the BBC article, Chen's sights mentions that there are 70 million people

45
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,280
who are currently displaced.

46
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,680
70 million.

47
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,680
Canada resettled 28,000.

48
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,120
Consider that disparity for a moment.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,400
You might be wondering where these people are.

50
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:04,840
The top five countries currently taking care of refugees are Turkey with 3.7 million refugees,

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,480
Pakistan with 1.4 million refugees, Uganda with 1.2 million, Sudan with 1.1 million,

52
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:15,060
and Germany with 1.1 million.

53
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,700
That 28,000 number isn't exactly accurate.

54
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,660
That was just how many Canada took in within 2018 itself.

55
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:29,340
The total number of refugees currently living in Canada is 114,109.

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,860
And there are currently 78,806 asylum seekers.

57
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,820
The difference between a refugee and an asylum seeker is that an asylum seeker is generally

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,460
someone who is applying for refugee status.

59
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:43,940
A refugee is actually a legally defined term, one that is given to someone who has been

60
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:50,820
properly vetted by, for example, the UN-HCR, which is the UN Refugee Agency.

61
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:55,580
From here, the video turns into a lot of generic vague UN bashing.

62
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,900
She actually made a whole video where she criticizes the UN and she doesn't seem to

63
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:06,860
understand it and what it's supposed to do, so she just seems to think it does nothing.

64
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,860
Think of it.

65
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,060
What national long-term policies, which have made countries better, can the UN take credit

66
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,060
for?

67
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,100
The UN isn't responsible for national policy.

68
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,060
That would be the responsibility of a nation's federal government.

69
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,820
The UN isn't a governing body.

70
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,540
I don't know how to explain this more simply.

71
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,500
If you're complaining that the UN hasn't fixed these nations, whatever that means,

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,660
it's not because the UN hasn't been trying.

73
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:37,420
It all depends on the participation of the member nations to make it all work.

74
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:42,540
What the UN tries to pitch is them improving the world, is simply moving people from bad

75
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,820
countries to good countries.

76
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,900
And then she says something like this, where she's under the impression that the UN's

77
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,540
primary goal has been to relocate people through its refugee program.

78
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,900
The UN-HCR's mission is not to fix countries with any sort of internal strife, it's to

79
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,140
protect the well-being of people who have been displaced.

80
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:08,820
I don't know why the UN is being defined by a single program that operates under the

81
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,940
General Assembly, and then being judged for not meeting these other unnamed goals.

82
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:18,580
But it's an absurdly reductous reading of one of the most important institutions in

83
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,660
the world.

84
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:26,500
And if you want a list of some of the things the UN has done, it's helped eradicate smallpox.

85
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,460
I think that's pretty good.

86
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,340
Through UNICEF, it's saved the lives of tens of millions of children.

87
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:37,900
It's helped reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.

88
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,180
The General Assembly's clamping down on South Africa helped end apartheid in the region.

89
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:46,620
It's actually done a lot of really great things in the world, and I'll include links with

90
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,660
even more stuff it's done in the description box.

91
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,580
Let's take a moment to see Lauren fail to read.

92
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,020
Article 14 of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the

93
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,300
right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.

94
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,860
Uh, I'm sorry, no.

95
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,060
How on earth is that a human right?

96
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,140
I mean, I guess you could say you have the right to seek asylum.

97
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,100
You can seek whatever you want, I suppose, but you don't have the right to enjoy asylum

98
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,900
in other countries.

99
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,860
Where would that right come from?

100
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,500
No, that's not how you read that.

101
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,460
No one is saying everyone can simply be granted asylum on request.

102
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,420
The term enjoy asylum means that no person should ever be forbidden from being granted

103
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:32,420
asylum.

104
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,240
That is, someone who has gone through the asylum application process and being granted

105
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,880
refugee status.

106
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,800
Pretty much every country in the world has some number of refugees living in it, so the

107
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:46,160
fact that this simple article blows Lauren's mind shows how little she understands the

108
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,160
process.

109
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,780
Literally, no country on earth, as far as I know, grants asylum to anyone who shows

110
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,320
up and asks for it.

111
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,280
There's always a vetting process, and considering the UNHCR helps manage a lot of these vetting

112
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,160
processes, I think they support them.

113
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Not to mention that persecution is just such a vague word.

114
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,760
Essentially, all it means is ill treatment or hostility.

115
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,440
No, it doesn't.

116
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,120
Okay, let's actually do something fun and talk about what a refugee is actually defined

117
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,720
as according to the UNHCR.

118
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,960
A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution,

119
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,960
war, or violence.

120
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:29,280
A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality,

121
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,120
political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.

122
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,680
Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so.

123
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:42,680
War and ethnic, tribal, and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their

124
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,800
countries.

125
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,880
That seems pretty specific.

126
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,760
Lauren seems to be under the impression that there is no vetting process.

127
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:54,880
Everybody in that country gets to just leave and choose another country to move to, and

128
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,360
it has to be granted because it's their human right to seek asylum.

129
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,200
Does any Western European person who speaks out against Islam or mass immigration, what

130
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:09,280
they call hate speech over there, get to come to the US and seek asylum under this declaration?

131
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,520
Is that how that works?

132
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
That's weird.

133
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,360
I hear a lot of anti-Islam stuff coming out of Western Europe all the time, but I guess

134
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,280
they're being persecuted somewhere, okay?

135
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,480
As far as I can tell, no one from Western Europe has applied for asylum because they've

136
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,000
been persecuted for speaking out against Islam.

137
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,040
They can try that.

138
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,080
I don't think that application is going to turn out so well.

139
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,440
The fact that she thinks the UN-HCRC is no difference between that and someone who's

140
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,720
trying to escape a war zone, it stretches my ability to believe she's being a serious

141
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
person.

142
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,200
Now she's going to say something even more ridiculous.

143
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:48,120
What the UN is saying is that it would be someone's human right to just show up at your

144
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,400
country and say, hey, I'm going to enjoy asylum here.

145
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,560
And in order to not violate their rights, not only would you have to let them in, but

146
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:00,600
you would also be obligated to give them food, housing, and clothing.

147
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,840
F*** you!

148
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:04,520
I'm genuinely stunned at this.

149
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:10,240
Okay, leaving aside Lauren's outrage at the idea that all people should have access to

150
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,280
food and shelter, somehow confusing it with the UN advocating some sort of socialist nanny

151
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,840
state, I think that's how she's reading it.

152
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,720
Leaving all that aside, an asylum seeker actually is entitled to food and shelter.

153
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,360
The reason asylum seekers are giving these things is because once they apply for asylum,

154
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,200
they are essentially in the custody of the government in which they're applying to.

155
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,880
When a government takes a person into custody, it's expected to provide them food and shelter.

156
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,600
This is truly basic stuff, and Lauren's response to the idea that people the government takes

157
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,320
into custody should be given food and shelter is f*** you!

158
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,480
I wonder if she could be so brazen to say this to some of the refugee children currently

159
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:57,520
staying in Mexico after fleeing their homes in Central America.

160
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,600
You know the exact people the original article she mentioned was discussing?

161
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,520
The people who are fleeing gang violence and who are often the target?

162
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,600
Boys for recruitment, girls for… much worse than that.

163
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:14,600
When they would come seeking asylum, the idea of giving them food and shelter, Lauren would

164
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,600
say,

165
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,600
F*** you!

166
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Okay.

167
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:23,720
And frankly, the entire asylum process right now just needs to be revamped.

168
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,600
As it stands, anyone can show up at your board or request asylum.

169
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:31,440
You have to clothe them, feed them, provide them medical attention, even if you don't

170
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
end up letting them in.

171
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,440
Yes.

172
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
Yes, you do have to do that.

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Absolutely.

174
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
If someone applies for asylum and is willing to be taken into the custody of the government

175
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,160
and go through that lengthy process, yes, you do have to provide food and shelter for

176
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
them.

177
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,680
There used to be stricter guidelines of who does and does not qualify so you don't end

178
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,720
up with entire countries showing up at your board or demanding to be let in because their

179
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,960
life would be better if they lived in your country.

180
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,060
She seems to think this is something that people will take advantage of.

181
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,480
People will show up at a nation's borders and demand asylum because they really want

182
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:10,480
to stay locked up in a hotel somewhere for three months or really have much of a life.

183
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,680
Apparently, to her, that seems like something people would swim across the Atlantic Ocean

184
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,040
or fly here just to do that until an entire country shows up, requests asylum so they

185
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,560
can be locked up here for a couple of months.

186
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,280
I don't think the system needs to be revamped for something that isn't happening.

187
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:32,120
If country A is experiencing mass violence, sectarian warfare, or in general is failing

188
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,440
economically, what do you think moving everyone out of that country and putting them in a

189
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,040
different country is going to do?

190
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,520
Save their lives.

191
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,440
Do you think these people will just start magically behaving differently because their

192
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,080
geography has changed?

193
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,240
Sure, some individuals will be fine and be able to acclimate and succeed, but we're

194
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,760
not talking about individually screening people, are we?

195
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,440
No, we're talking about mass relocation.

196
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,960
We're not talking about resettling individuals.

197
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,880
We're resettling groups.

198
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:05,400
She seems to think that asylum is something that's granted en masse with no real screening

199
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
or vetting.

200
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,960
That's not how it works.

201
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,240
People are screened individually when applying for asylum.

202
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,880
Voting has always been a part of the refugee process, and typically the people who are

203
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:21,000
causing the problems in that country generally aren't trying to go somewhere else.

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:27,720
No one who's a brutal dictator in, say, Syria, for example, is going to pack up their life,

205
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,840
go live as a refugee in Sweden somewhere.

206
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:34,440
They're going to continue living on in a place where they can freely oppress and brutalize

207
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,680
the citizenry.

208
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,560
This is about helping people who are trying to escape that.

209
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,440
The fact that she doesn't understand this, the fact that she sees them as, like, parasites

210
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,800
who are coming to suck the resources out of a country, it's truly revolting, and it shows

211
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,440
how little she understands what it means to be a refugee.

212
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,680
What's especially worrying was glancing at the comments section and all the people complaining

213
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,240
about illegal immigration.

214
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,080
Here's one comment that Lauren herself liked.

215
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,240
Dear Lauren, my parents were legal immigrants to the US.

216
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
They applied to the US.

217
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,960
They waited the necessary five years and then moved legally to the US.

218
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,960
My parents were DPs in Europe, meaning they had been displaced by the war and could not

219
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,600
go back to their countries at the end of the war because their countries had been overrun

220
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,600
by communists.

221
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,480
I have absolutely no care whatsoever about the illegals.

222
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,400
If they want to come here, legally let them go through the process.

223
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,860
Applying for asylum and being granted refugee status is the legal process.

224
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,800
This is not about illegal immigration.

225
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,000
There are a number of other comments that make references to illegal immigration, and

226
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,080
if I were Lauren, I would be alarmed, alarmed that so many people in my comments are so

227
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
misinformed.

228
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,160
They don't even understand what the video is about, but then again, Lauren doesn't even

229
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,800
understand what she's talking about, so it's not a surprise that her viewers are similarly

230
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,720
misinformed.

231
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,600
It really depresses me.

232
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,160
Refugees are some of the most vulnerable people in the world.

233
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:03,360
When I see this sort of nonsense being pushed against them, it makes me really angry, and

234
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,960
I probably sound more sad than angry right now because I've had a couple of hours to

235
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,460
cool off, write this little script out in a bit of a fury, and now I just feel kind

236
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,860
of sad.

237
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,740
Sad to think how campaigning like this reduces the number of refugees who are, again, granted

238
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,140
that specific status and are being turned away because there's all this misinformation

239
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:29,140
from people who really have no interest in allowing others in.

240
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,340
These are the sentiments that leads to overcrowding in refugee camps because the native population

241
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,400
sees them as a threat.

242
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:41,940
These are the words and ideas that create this fiction that refugees are a danger and

243
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:47,140
are likely to cause crime and trouble in their host nations, something the stats don't really

244
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,300
support.

245
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,220
I want us to do better than this.

246
00:14:51,220 --> 00:15:02,060
We can do better than these ideas, these sentiments, and I hope one day we will.

247
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,700
So this video is a bit of a venting.

248
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,260
Again, I wasn't planning on making this video.

249
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:10,580
I'm doing this one very quickly because I'm in the midst of a very large project.

250
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:14,720
It's another deep dive into another video about refugees.

251
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,100
This video is already longer than I expected.

252
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,280
I just want to close it up by thanking all my patrons.

253
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,100
Their names are on the screen, and they are some truly lovely people.

254
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,860
If you would like to be as wonderful as those patrons, you can head over to my Patreon and

255
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,900
donate whatever you're comfortable with, whatever is in your means.

256
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,180
Please don't go hungry on account of giving me money, but I do appreciate every little

257
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:42,380
bit someone can spare me because these videos are a labor of love, and it takes a bit of

258
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:47,000
time out of my life to produce them, and I appreciate everyone who watches them.

259
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,680
Everyone who subscribes, likes, leaves a comment.

260
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,700
I do this for all of you, and I hope it's appreciated.

261
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:56,020
And if it's not, I don't know, go watch a Lauren Chen video.

262
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,620
No, don't watch that.

263
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:58,620
Go outside.

264
00:15:58,620 --> 00:15:59,620
Live.

265
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,620
Enjoy your life.

266
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:04,220
I understand that there are people out there sitting in refugee camps who could be resettled

267
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,940
to a nation, and enjoy a life as well.

268
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:11,820
If only it weren't for demagogues like Lauren Chen speaking out against them.

269
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,420
Thanks for watching.
