00:00.000 --> 00:09.640
The Cosby Show was one of the most successful sitcoms of all time.

00:09.640 --> 00:15.000
Premiering in 1984 and running for eight seasons, it spent five consecutive seasons as the number

00:15.000 --> 00:17.360
one rated show in the United States.

00:17.360 --> 00:21.240
The only other sitcom to do that was All on the Family in the 1970s, and not a single

00:21.240 --> 00:23.560
sitcom has been able to do it since.

00:23.560 --> 00:28.880
At its peak, The Cosby Show is being watched by over a third of all households in America.

00:28.880 --> 00:33.560
Accredited with not only reviving the sitcom genre in the 1980s, The Cosby Show also broke

00:33.560 --> 00:37.560
barriers by being a hit show that featured a black middle-class family.

00:37.560 --> 00:41.560
It won six Emmys during its run, along with countless other awards and accolades.

00:41.560 --> 00:46.200
Though the revelations surrounding Bill Cosby's predatory behavior cast a shadow on the series,

00:46.200 --> 00:50.220
well before then, and certainly during its run, there was a deep critical contention

00:50.220 --> 00:53.840
about what to make of The Cosby Show's vision of the world.

00:53.840 --> 00:58.000
It was a show filled with black culture, but often passed on depicting the realities of

00:58.000 --> 01:01.220
what it meant to be black in America in the 1980s.

01:01.220 --> 01:05.960
The discussion around The Cosby Show is, in many ways, just as, or perhaps even more interesting

01:05.960 --> 01:10.040
than the show itself, but before we dig into what this show means, we have to understand

01:10.040 --> 01:13.500
what it was and the context in which it premiered.

01:13.500 --> 01:17.680
And that will help us understand why it's so hard to know how to talk about The Cosby

01:17.680 --> 01:18.680
Show.

01:18.680 --> 01:22.600
The history of black Americans on television began with marginal roles, often as guest

01:22.600 --> 01:25.000
performers, only making brief appearances.

01:25.000 --> 01:28.800
It wasn't until the 1960s where we started seeing reoccurring roles for black actors,

01:28.800 --> 01:32.920
albeit typically in bit parts, playing two stereotypes inspired by minstrel shows.

01:32.920 --> 01:37.080
It was in this world William H. Cosby found himself when he began working as a stand-up

01:37.080 --> 01:40.520
comedian, performing in San Francisco in the 1960s.

01:40.520 --> 01:45.840
By 1963, he was on The Tonight Show, and he released his first stand-up LP titled Bill

01:45.840 --> 01:48.120
Cosby is a Very Funny Fellow.

01:48.120 --> 01:49.120
Right.

01:49.120 --> 01:53.040
As a black comedian performing in the 1960s, Cosby's comedy style took a shape that would

01:53.040 --> 01:55.720
reflect much of his work throughout his career.

01:55.720 --> 01:59.320
While aware that he was performing to a predominantly white audience, he fashioned his comedy in

01:59.320 --> 02:00.880
a way that would not upset them.

02:00.880 --> 02:18.840
He described it in an interview with the CBC in 1963.

02:18.840 --> 02:23.240
In 1965, Cosby's star kept rising as he landed a starring role in the television series

02:23.240 --> 02:28.400
I Spy alongside Robert Culp, one of the earliest examples of a black actor starring in a drama

02:28.400 --> 02:29.400
series.

02:29.400 --> 02:33.840
Although a first-time actor, Cosby won three Emmys for his portrayal of Agent Alexander

02:33.840 --> 02:34.840
Scott.

02:34.840 --> 02:38.680
Around Bill Cosby, the civil rights movement of the 50s and 60s had started to make an

02:38.680 --> 02:40.920
impact in the entertainment world.

02:40.920 --> 02:44.720
Bill Cosby's strategy to address bigotry and racism was to create media that unpacked

02:44.720 --> 02:46.640
the impact it had on children.

02:46.640 --> 02:52.320
In 1968, he presented a film titled Black History, Lost, Stolen, or Strayed.

02:52.320 --> 02:57.640
Now, if you tell the history of slavery right, you've got a big problem on your hands.

02:57.640 --> 03:01.560
The slave trader didn't take some savage out of Africa.

03:01.560 --> 03:10.600
He took a human being, sold him like an animal, and separated him from his family.

03:10.600 --> 03:14.720
America invented the cruelest slavery in the history of them, since it broke up black

03:14.720 --> 03:15.720
families.

03:15.720 --> 03:21.520
After slavery was over, America kept breaking up the black man's family.

03:21.520 --> 03:24.640
And that's some awful history to teach.

03:24.640 --> 03:29.160
Fifty years later, and parts of this film still speak very powerfully, Cosby would continue

03:29.160 --> 03:33.680
to define his comedy and how it reflects upon race, always cognizant of the audience watching

03:33.680 --> 03:36.000
him and the limitations he believed that created.

03:37.000 --> 03:59.760
In the 1970s, we began to see a greater number of shows with predominantly black casts, such

03:59.760 --> 04:03.240
as The Jeffersons, Sanford and Son, and Good Times.

04:03.240 --> 04:07.160
Those that not only highlighted black characters, but gave them a wider range of experiences

04:07.160 --> 04:09.400
and stories than previously seen.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.960
Of course, the 1970s weren't a haven of black representation on TV.

04:12.960 --> 04:16.960
Stereotypes were abundant, with criminals and cop shows often being presented as black,

04:16.960 --> 04:20.400
while black families were typically working class and rarely anything else.

04:20.400 --> 04:24.880
Whereas many black actors found new opportunities on the sitcoms of the 1970s, Bill Cosby instead

04:24.880 --> 04:29.360
starred in the short-lived The Bill Cosby Show, where Cosby played a phys-ed teacher.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.360
It only ran for two seasons.

04:31.360 --> 04:35.320
We spent much of the decade creating entertainment for our younger audience, such as Fat Albert

04:35.320 --> 04:38.600
and the Cosby kids, and appearing on segments of The Electric Company.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.640
He also returned to school, where he earned a doctorate of education from the University

04:42.640 --> 04:45.840
of Massachusetts Amherst in 1977.

04:45.840 --> 04:50.080
Cosby also spent the 1970s becoming a fixture in advertisements, particularly for Jello

04:50.080 --> 04:54.040
and Coca-Cola, further cementing his family-friendly image.

04:54.040 --> 04:58.240
As the 1970s ended, it was believed in Hollywood that sitcoms were becoming less popular with

04:58.240 --> 04:59.240
audiences.

04:59.240 --> 05:03.080
In 1983, only two sitcoms cracked the top 20 most-watched shows on television in the

05:03.080 --> 05:04.200
United States.

05:04.200 --> 05:08.380
As audiences for sitcoms declined, networks started placing a greater emphasis on appealing

05:08.380 --> 05:13.160
to the majority white audience, and that often meant sitcoms starring a black cast, or episodes

05:13.160 --> 05:15.700
touching on the issues of race, were to be avoided.

05:15.700 --> 05:20.280
This was when TV producers Marcie Carsey and Tom Werner approached Bill Cosby about creating

05:20.280 --> 05:21.280
a sitcom.

05:21.280 --> 05:25.400
Though Cosby hadn't worked on a TV series for years, he had still been doing stand-up,

05:25.400 --> 05:28.480
and that was the approach the producers took when speaking to him.

05:29.480 --> 05:35.480
In his monologues, he was talking, as he always did, about the commonality of the human experience,

05:35.480 --> 05:44.760
not the particular specific thing about being a black family with not enough money and not

05:44.760 --> 05:47.400
enough resources in this world today.

05:47.400 --> 05:52.800
So we were trying to bring him back to the premise of what had been his entire career,

05:52.800 --> 05:56.360
which is the commonality, the universality of the human experience.

05:56.360 --> 05:59.920
Cosby's original vision of the show was a working-class family, with himself as a

05:59.920 --> 06:02.920
limo driver and his wife working in-home maintenance.

06:02.920 --> 06:06.440
Due to the influence of the show's producers and Bill Cosby's wife Camille, the show's

06:06.440 --> 06:10.560
premise was changed to make the show's lead couple, Cliff and Claire Huxtable, a doctor

06:10.560 --> 06:12.560
and lawyer, respectively.

06:12.560 --> 06:14.720
This approach was a perfect fit for the decade.

06:14.720 --> 06:19.280
The 1980s marked a stark rise in conservatism in American media, and with that a strong

06:19.280 --> 06:22.400
desire for issues such as race to be considered settled.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.280
This was all under the mantra of colorblindness and the idea that racial discrimination was

06:27.280 --> 06:28.280
over.

06:28.280 --> 06:32.480
The Cosby Show would not be a show about a black family and the unique issues that impacted

06:32.480 --> 06:37.280
black families, it would be about an American family, with the universal issues that supposedly

06:37.280 --> 06:39.800
affected all American families.

06:39.800 --> 06:44.520
In spite of its future success, initially the Cosby Show was a difficult sell to networks.

06:44.520 --> 06:48.200
Comedies were considered dead after all, and the major networks, including NBC, all

06:48.200 --> 06:49.800
passed on the series.

06:49.800 --> 06:54.800
Eventually, NBC reconsidered though, and an order was made for several episodes.

06:54.800 --> 07:05.280
And in 1984, the Cosby Show would go on to dominate television.

07:05.280 --> 07:09.160
Even though the title of the series is The Cosby Show, Cosby didn't use his real name

07:09.160 --> 07:10.480
for his TV family.

07:10.480 --> 07:14.960
He played the role of Heath Cliff Huxtable, the family patriarch, easily identified by

07:14.960 --> 07:17.480
his colorful sweaters and sage advice.

07:17.480 --> 07:21.640
Much of the character and the family of Cliff Huxtable was based on Bill Cosby, with him

07:21.640 --> 07:26.840
similarly having four daughters and one son, and many of his lines were ad-libbed on set,

07:26.840 --> 07:30.080
which had the effect of blending the actor and character together.

07:30.080 --> 07:34.360
His playful attitude with children and unflinching ability to set his kids on the right path

07:34.360 --> 07:55.000
made him one of the most popular fathers in sitcom history.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.240
Claire Huxtable was played by Felicia Rashad, the real force in The Huxtable Home.

07:59.240 --> 08:02.280
Claire offered a strength and grace to hold the family together.

08:02.280 --> 08:06.160
She managed to run a household while being a partner at her law firm, a woman who seemingly

08:06.160 --> 08:07.160
had it all.

08:07.160 --> 08:10.840
Rashad was an accomplished stage actress and is credited for keeping up with the energetic

08:10.840 --> 08:15.040
performance of Cosby, and the pair's chemistry made the Huxtable parents seem like an almost

08:15.040 --> 08:36.800
perfect match.

08:36.800 --> 08:40.400
Lisa Bonet played Denise Huxtable, the second oldest in the family.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.800
She grew from being a studious high school student into a free spirit, so much so that

08:44.800 --> 08:48.480
her character almost seemed transformed by the end of her time on the show.

08:48.480 --> 09:13.680
In the earlier seasons, she was the crush of many young teens watching at home.

09:13.680 --> 09:18.400
Theodore Huxtable, or Theo for short, was played by Malcolm Jamal Warner, the middle

09:18.400 --> 09:20.040
child and only boy.

09:20.040 --> 09:23.800
Theo was often at odds with his parents, having trouble in school and generally making things

09:23.800 --> 09:25.240
a mess for his family.

09:25.240 --> 09:29.160
A less experienced actor than some of his castmates, Warner was chosen because Cosby

09:29.160 --> 09:42.880
considered his performance to feel especially real.

09:42.880 --> 09:46.720
Tempest Bloodsow played Vanessa Huxtable, the second youngest child in the Huxtable

09:46.720 --> 09:47.720
home.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.320
Eleven years old at the series' onset, she's a particularly bright student and even more

09:51.320 --> 09:53.600
clever at finding out how to get things her own way.

09:53.600 --> 09:57.720
Bloodsow's performance is especially impressive considering her age, revealing a real gift

09:57.720 --> 10:09.120
for comedy.

10:09.120 --> 10:15.640
The youngest child in the Huxtable home is Rudy, short for Rudith, played by Keisha Knight-Pulium.

10:15.640 --> 10:20.000
Just painfully cute, Rudy grows considerably throughout the series, going from a darling

10:20.000 --> 10:23.160
child of five to a strong-willed thirteen-year-old.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.160
Originally Rudy was written to be a boy, and Knight-Pulium was only brought in because of

10:26.160 --> 10:28.440
how cute she had appeared in a commercial.

10:28.440 --> 10:32.220
The role came down to Knight-Pulium and a young Julia White, who had later gone to play

10:32.220 --> 10:49.180
Steve Urkel on Family Matters, but the role eventually went to Knight-Pulium.

10:49.180 --> 10:52.860
The last member to join the family in the first season was the oldest Huxtable child,

10:52.860 --> 10:55.060
Sandra, played by Sabrina LaBeouf.

10:55.060 --> 10:59.140
First appearing in episode 10 of the first season, LaBeouf would join the principal cast

10:59.140 --> 11:00.860
in the show's second season.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.500
In the first season, Sandra made a part of the family, albeit in ways that often left

11:04.500 --> 11:26.940
her off-screen, pursuing her education at Princeton.

11:26.940 --> 11:30.460
There's also a number of recurring guest stars on the show, such as Cliff's father

11:30.460 --> 11:35.100
Russell, played by Earl Hyman, his mother Anna, played by Clarice Taylor, and Rudy's

11:35.100 --> 11:37.620
friend Kenny, played by Dionne Richmond.

11:37.620 --> 11:41.860
And the number of celebrity guest stars was enormous on the show, particularly black artists

11:41.860 --> 11:45.920
such as Sammy Davis Jr., Stevie Wonder, and Bebe King.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.540
The show made a concentrated effort to highlight a world where people of all cultures were

11:49.540 --> 11:53.420
shown to be living in friendship and harmony, and particularly highlighted a black family

11:53.420 --> 11:56.420
that embraced culture that reflected their heritage.

11:56.420 --> 11:59.900
Absolutely novel at the time, the series was credited with presenting black culture to

11:59.900 --> 12:02.540
a white audience, creating greater acceptance of it.

12:02.540 --> 12:06.900
But the Huxtables lived in a bubble that was almost never pierced by discussions of race.

12:06.900 --> 12:11.460
Though topics such as sexism, drugs, and learning disabilities would arise in the series, race

12:11.460 --> 12:13.840
was largely subtextual.

12:13.840 --> 12:17.860
This was a deliberate choice by Cosby, and is at the heart of why the show became beloved

12:17.860 --> 12:25.500
by some audiences and hotly debated by others.

12:25.500 --> 12:29.500
The world met the Cosby Show on September 20th, 1984.

12:29.500 --> 12:35.260
The pilot, titled Pilot, began with Claire and the four Huxtable kids, Denise, Theo,

12:35.260 --> 12:49.060
Vanessa, and Rudy, preparing breakfast while dancing to some music.

12:49.060 --> 13:01.620
The cast had a nice, easy chemistry with one another, and we soon meet Cliff.

13:01.620 --> 13:05.780
This moment helped establish the two parenting styles of the Huxtables.

13:05.780 --> 13:09.900
While both Cliff and Claire are firm with their kids, Cliff is very much the goofy one

13:09.900 --> 13:12.300
who enjoys messing around with the children.

13:12.300 --> 13:16.180
Part of the inspiration for the series was the stand-up work Cosby was doing at the time,

13:16.180 --> 13:31.340
and we can see the dialogue borrowed heavily from that material.

13:31.340 --> 13:35.260
The pilot, along with many episodes in the earlier seasons of the Cosby Show, was very

13:35.260 --> 13:39.580
light on plot, instead opting to include a number of scenes that reflected the everyday

13:39.580 --> 13:43.860
moments of raising children, such as when Cliff is briefly introduced to Denise's

13:44.860 --> 13:53.020
The main plotline of this episode, and certainly

13:53.020 --> 13:57.660
its most memorable moment, surrounds Theo's report card, which is filled with straight

13:57.660 --> 13:58.660
Ds.

13:58.660 --> 14:02.940
He and Cliff discuss how low grades will lead to a low-paying job, and the economics

14:02.940 --> 14:14.540
of that reality.

14:14.540 --> 14:18.500
Theo reveals that the pressure of having such successful parents makes him feel as though

14:18.500 --> 14:21.500
his parents don't love him for who he is.

14:21.500 --> 14:38.620
In front of a test audience of kids, this was the moment a lot of them applauded, much

14:38.620 --> 14:43.420
like the studio audience dutifully did after Theo made his point, but for a test audience

14:43.420 --> 14:53.580
of adults, there was a much stronger reaction to the following line.

14:53.580 --> 14:57.940
This moment reflected two very important reasons why the show became such a huge success.

14:57.940 --> 15:02.060
The first was that, by making both perspectives, the child and the adults, it appealed to an

15:02.060 --> 15:06.980
audience across generations, but perhaps more importantly, what adults appreciated was seeing

15:06.980 --> 15:09.780
a parent establishing their authority.

15:09.780 --> 15:13.860
In the early 1980s, what few sitcoms were on the air tended to feature precocious children

15:13.860 --> 15:16.180
who often knew better than the adults around them.

15:16.180 --> 15:20.220
Cliff so clearly demonstrated why he was the father of the family reversed that relationship,

15:20.220 --> 15:23.740
and though it might have seemed novel at the time, it reflected an older vision of how

15:23.740 --> 15:28.620
sitcoms used to work, where children would need a wise father to set their lives in order.

15:28.620 --> 15:33.340
The father-knows-best dynamic was seen in shows such as The Andy Griffith Show, Leave

15:33.340 --> 15:37.220
It to Beaver, and, well, Father Knows Best.

15:37.220 --> 15:41.180
After airing, The Cosby Show was an instant hit, becoming the top-rated show not just

15:41.180 --> 15:43.660
for its night, but for the entire week.

15:43.660 --> 15:47.220
It began a streak of reading success that would propel the series to be the third most

15:47.220 --> 15:51.820
watched show in the United States in its first season, and it was only going up from there.

15:51.820 --> 15:56.140
The Cosby Show's early episodes had a very light, improvisational energy, and this was

15:56.140 --> 15:59.980
reflected in how much of it was put together on the fly, particularly scenes with Bill

15:59.980 --> 16:00.980
Cosby.

16:00.980 --> 16:04.580
Cosby had a tendency to improvise his lines throughout each episode.

16:04.580 --> 16:08.500
Returning to the show's producers, tapings tended to go long as Cosby would frequently

16:08.500 --> 16:11.020
go off script and ad-lib through scenes.

16:11.020 --> 16:13.220
As one example, a scene written as,

16:13.220 --> 16:26.660
Cliff Cooking would turn into this.

16:26.660 --> 16:29.940
This isn't to suggest that the show was entirely improvised, though.

16:29.940 --> 16:33.900
Cosby's earlier work, Educating Children, informed how the series would be put together,

16:33.900 --> 16:38.060
as one of the principles of the show was to create family situations that were realistic,

16:38.060 --> 16:41.660
which meant plotlines deliberately crafted with that in mind.

16:41.660 --> 16:46.500
One example is the episode Goodbye, Mr. Fish, in which the death of Rudy's goldfish Lamont

16:46.500 --> 16:50.180
leads Rudy into mourning, and the family holds a funeral to protect Rudy's fragile

16:50.180 --> 16:58.140
affections for her now-departed goldfish.

16:58.140 --> 17:16.620
They find out Rudy's mourning period isn't as long as they expected.

17:16.620 --> 17:20.260
The episode ends with Cliff accidentally dropping the fish into the toilet and the family getting

17:20.260 --> 17:21.260
back to normal.

17:21.260 --> 17:25.060
It's a realistic depiction of how kids are more resilient than we give them credit for,

17:25.060 --> 17:28.380
while still highlighting the importance of a family that acknowledges and makes space

17:28.380 --> 17:30.740
for kids to deal with those challenges.

17:30.740 --> 17:34.060
But part of the reason the Huxtable Kids are so resilient is that in the early seasons

17:34.060 --> 17:38.060
of the series, none of the challenges they personally face are more than a kid could

17:38.060 --> 17:39.060
handle.

17:39.060 --> 17:42.460
That's not to say that these things don't exist in the world of the Cosby Show.

17:42.460 --> 17:45.260
Really bad things never happen to the Huxtable Kids.

17:45.260 --> 17:47.600
Bad things only ever happen around them.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.900
The episode titled Theo and the Joint from the first season might immediately sound like

17:50.900 --> 17:55.300
an episode about Theo trying marijuana, but rather than being tempted by a drug, we instead

17:55.300 --> 18:00.020
find out that the mysterious joint, Claire discovers in Theo's textbook, wasn't his,

18:00.020 --> 18:14.380
but was hidden there by another student, Tony Braxton.

18:14.380 --> 18:18.820
The Huxtables trusts Theo, though he insists on proving his innocence and Tony eventually

18:18.820 --> 18:35.560
has a heart-to-heart moment with Dr. Huxtable.

18:35.560 --> 18:40.820
This pattern of a Huxtable Kid avoiding danger is repeated in the season 3 episode, Calling

18:40.820 --> 19:08.360
Dr. Huxtable where Vanessa's friend is revealed to have been smoking in Vanessa's room.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.740
And in season 2's Close to Home, Cliff finds out the daughter of a friend is addicted

19:12.740 --> 19:28.080
to drugs.

19:28.080 --> 19:32.120
The fear of a child becoming addicted to drugs was a huge part of the 80s, with the launch

19:32.120 --> 19:34.640
of anti-drug campaigns such as D.A.R.E.

19:34.640 --> 19:38.940
A sitcom tackling these issues made perfect sense, though the Huxtable Kids themselves

19:38.940 --> 19:40.820
are never presented to be at risk.

19:40.820 --> 19:44.580
If anything, they were the positive influences in their peer group, telling their friends

19:44.580 --> 19:48.040
not to smoke, or bringing a random kid home to talk to Cliff.

19:48.040 --> 19:52.180
In this way, the Huxtables never felt quite so real as the world around them.

19:52.180 --> 19:55.620
The drug-free behavior is often credited to the parenting of the Huxtables.

19:55.620 --> 19:59.500
When Theo speaks to Tony about being concerned, here's how Theo explains it.

19:59.500 --> 20:15.280
But conversely, when Cliff is talking to his friend, there doesn't seem to be an

20:15.280 --> 20:45.220
easy answer as to how his daughter became addicted.

20:45.220 --> 20:49.600
When Cliff says it's up to Cindy, his friend's daughter, to write her life, it serves as

20:49.600 --> 20:53.600
an acknowledgement of the limitations of good parenting, and falls back on the message

20:53.600 --> 20:56.400
of personal responsibility that runs throughout the series.

20:56.400 --> 21:00.640
Though considering Theo's moment earlier on, personal responsibility is a trait imbued

21:00.640 --> 21:02.640
in kids by their parents.

21:02.640 --> 21:07.280
In the episode titled The Shower, Denise holds a bridal shower for her friend Veronica, who

21:07.280 --> 21:17.060
is secretly pregnant.

21:17.060 --> 21:21.140
Shockingly we find out the pregnancy was a ploy to get permission from her parents to

21:21.140 --> 21:29.660
consent to her marriage.

21:29.660 --> 21:33.420
Teen pregnancy came up again in the episode titled Denise's Friend, though in that case

21:33.420 --> 21:35.220
it was a false alarm.

21:35.220 --> 21:40.000
Much like the Huxtable kids and drugs, at no point is Denise ever in danger of becoming

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
pregnant.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.280
Those are challenges for other families, not the Huxtables.

21:44.280 --> 21:48.000
When it came to helping Veronica, it ended very much the way Close to Home ended, with

21:48.000 --> 22:03.560
the Huxtables realizing the limitations of their influence around them.

22:03.560 --> 22:07.740
There doesn't seem to be a clear satisfying answer to a situation like this one, but the

22:07.740 --> 22:12.500
show's eventual moral of the importance of personal responsibility rings hollow.

22:12.500 --> 22:16.300
The show's attempt to depict a realistic home life rests on the assumption of a home

22:16.300 --> 22:20.860
life with two devoted parents, who have raised kids that are capable of avoiding serious

22:20.860 --> 22:25.220
challenges in the world that go beyond the impact of a heart-to-heart conversation with

22:25.220 --> 22:26.520
one of their parents.

22:26.520 --> 22:30.140
The safe environment is taken for granted in the Cosby Show, making it easier to deliver

22:30.140 --> 22:32.740
the message of personal responsibility.

22:32.760 --> 22:36.400
And there are times when that personal responsibility theme, which is constantly hit throughout

22:36.400 --> 22:39.160
the series, is completely fair and valid.

22:39.160 --> 22:44.200
For instance, in the episode Denise Gets a D, Denise's bad grade forces her to acknowledge

22:44.200 --> 22:45.600
her struggles in school.

23:02.740 --> 23:08.020
With some help from Claire to encourage her along, Denise is able to take charge of her

23:08.020 --> 23:11.000
schoolwork and make a better effort on her essay.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.680
Episodes like these, while simple, send a positive message, but they're only possible

23:14.680 --> 23:19.360
insofar that they exist in a world where the Huxtable kids are never truly challenged.

23:19.360 --> 23:23.720
And when those challenges never permeate the Huxtable household, a place of strong family

23:23.720 --> 23:28.440
tides and quality parenting emphasizing personal responsibility, it creates this implication

23:28.440 --> 23:33.140
that those who face those challenges have some sort of personal moral failure created

23:33.140 --> 23:35.900
by parents who have failed in raising their kids.

23:35.900 --> 23:40.420
The Huxtable home is a world unto itself, a place where kids are always safe.

23:40.420 --> 23:43.980
One particularly interesting way this is shown to us is how frequently young children take

23:43.980 --> 23:45.220
center stage.

23:45.220 --> 23:49.180
The series has a number of episodes that are happily narrated as being for the kids.

23:49.180 --> 24:01.260
In The Slumber Party, Cliff suggests Rudy holds a sleepover, and when her friends arrive

24:01.260 --> 24:19.380
we get a series of small moments of Cliff playing with the children.

24:19.380 --> 24:22.340
The editing and natural reactions from the children feel that these scenes had a lot

24:22.340 --> 24:25.060
of improvisation in them, and that a lot of fun is being had on set.

24:25.060 --> 24:29.180
One of the very positive elements of moments like these is how it depicts a father having

24:29.180 --> 24:33.700
fun with kids, something at odds with the more traditional roles for fathers on television,

24:33.700 --> 24:38.060
being the strict, disciplinarian, or calm voice of reason, often being detached from

24:38.060 --> 24:42.180
their kids and not engaging in fun or playful behavior.

24:42.180 --> 24:45.780
The idea of Cliff Huxtable being all of those things expanded the idea of what a father

24:45.780 --> 24:50.300
could be, much in the same way depicting Claire as a strong presence in the household as well

24:50.300 --> 24:54.420
as being an accomplished professional, expanded the idea of what a mother could be.

24:54.420 --> 24:58.680
The Huxtables also had ample time to work together to do nice things for one another,

24:58.680 --> 25:03.040
one of the more famous examples is when for the 49th anniversary of Cliff's parents,

25:03.040 --> 25:07.720
Russell and Anna, family performed a lip-sync of Ray Charles' Night Time is the Right

25:07.720 --> 25:08.720
Time.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.840
The Huxtables are very clearly a family with some financial resources.

25:11.840 --> 25:16.760
Though a lot of plot lines involve Cliff and Claire imparting financial caution to their

25:16.760 --> 25:20.680
children, they can't hide the fact that a family living in a brownstone in Brooklyn,

25:20.680 --> 25:25.160
headed by a doctor and lawyer, is probably financially secure.

25:25.160 --> 25:29.600
It certainly becomes readily apparent in the season 2 episode titled The Auction, and

25:29.600 --> 25:34.640
it Claire bids for a painting by her great uncle, Ellis Wilson, titled Funeral Procession.

25:34.640 --> 25:58.160
The

25:58.160 --> 26:04.040
very idea of spending $11,000 on a painting is truly jaw-dropping in the context of an

26:04.040 --> 26:08.160
upper middle-class family, it still seems like a lot, especially when there are five

26:08.160 --> 26:11.640
kids to take care of, but it does reflect the wealth of the Huxtables, and how their

26:11.640 --> 26:16.320
status as an average family isn't quite as average as one might initially suspect.

26:16.320 --> 26:20.640
This even catches up to Vanessa in the season 3 episode, Vanessa's Rich, where she's

26:20.640 --> 26:23.720
teased because her family could afford such an expensive painting.

26:23.720 --> 26:42.240
The moral of this episode is that friends are who you make of them and shouldn't be

26:42.240 --> 26:46.520
decided by class, though it's strange that when we hear about Vanessa being picked on,

26:46.520 --> 26:48.520
it's for her supposed wealth.

26:48.520 --> 26:53.840
Of all the forms of discrimination to face the Huxtables, their wealth is an odd choice.

26:53.840 --> 26:58.160
While this may seem like the show having a squeamish approach to depictions of discrimination,

26:58.160 --> 27:00.860
that wasn't entirely the case.

27:00.860 --> 27:04.440
From the first season and onward, the Cosby Show didn't shy away from depicting sexist

27:04.440 --> 27:07.660
characters and placing them very much in the wrong.

27:07.660 --> 27:11.200
Though there were several examples in the early seasons, it's made most clear with

27:11.200 --> 27:15.840
the introduction of Sandra's love interest, Elvin, played by Jeffrey Owens, first appearing

27:15.840 --> 27:19.120
in the season 2 episode, Cliff in Love.

27:19.120 --> 27:22.920
When we meet Elvin, we've already learned that he and Sandra have a rocky relationship,

27:22.920 --> 27:32.920
having just broken up again.

27:32.920 --> 27:54.800
When Elvin arrives, we get a sense of what the problem might be.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.560
Claire encourages Sandra to move on, and her friends set her up with a guy named Daryl,

27:58.560 --> 28:22.200
played by Joseph C. Phillips, who Cliff immediately tests.

28:22.200 --> 28:44.540
The idea of being concerned about his daughter dating someone who respects women is a surprisingly

28:44.540 --> 28:48.360
refreshing change of pace compared to sitcoms where fathers seem more concerned about their

28:48.360 --> 28:51.760
daughter's chastity, as if it were property to be protected.

28:51.760 --> 28:56.840
Sadly, much like how this episode ends with Sandra deciding to stay with Elvin, this enlightened

29:21.760 --> 29:34.520
character would be a fixture throughout the series, with Jeffrey Owens becoming a recurring

29:34.520 --> 29:38.880
guest star in season 2 and joining the principal cast permanently in season 3.

29:38.880 --> 29:42.280
Many of the early scenes with Elvin tend to be Cliff teaching him to lose his less

29:42.280 --> 29:59.960
enlightened takes, but a kind gesture from Elvin is immediately

30:30.960 --> 30:36.320
In this episode, Cliff's lesson to Elvin is to fake being able to make pasta sauce, much in the way Cliff does.

30:52.000 --> 30:55.600
While there's something nice about men teaching other men to be better to women,

30:55.600 --> 31:01.520
there's a falsity to all of this that doesn't sit well. The very act of cooking your own sauce

31:01.520 --> 31:07.600
without making it from scratch hardly seems like a distinction worth making, so what if Cliff or

31:07.600 --> 31:13.920
Elvin get their sauce from a jar? But by supposedly making it from scratch, they're taking on a role

31:13.920 --> 31:19.040
typically thought of as for women, and they do so so that the fury of the women won't come down

31:19.040 --> 31:23.600
upon them. This reveals an essentialism that lies at the heart of the Cosby Show's stance on gender

31:23.600 --> 31:29.520
dynamics. Women, of course, can do whatever men do, but the show also posits that they're emotional

31:29.520 --> 31:34.560
and scary for these beleaguered men who will say and do whatever they need to to get by, whether

31:34.560 --> 31:38.960
this means faking, making a meal from scratch, or holding their tongue when they have certain

31:38.960 --> 31:43.600
thoughts. More than anything, this reflects the changing gender roles for women in society in

31:43.600 --> 31:49.280
the 1980s, and some of the anxiety men feel towards them. Ultimately, Cliff has a good marriage, but

31:49.280 --> 31:53.360
he's still connected to an earlier day with assumptions about women being emotional and

31:53.360 --> 31:59.040
temperamental, which makes his supposedly respect for women limited, still using stereotypes instead

31:59.040 --> 32:04.320
of giving them space to be who they truly are. So while Cliff's behavior is an improvement,

32:04.320 --> 32:10.080
it only seems that way compared to someone like Elvin. As Elvin and Sandra's relationship develops,

32:10.080 --> 32:14.880
Elvin's more overt sexism slowly fades, though it seems less a product of Elvin learning how to be

32:14.960 --> 32:19.360
a better partner for Sandra, and more like his sexism was a trade the show didn't want to deal

32:19.360 --> 32:23.920
with anymore. There was an episode that tried to depict them coming to a greater understanding with

32:23.920 --> 32:29.040
one another, but it honestly read more like Elvin learning how to manipulate Sandra rather than him

32:29.040 --> 32:33.440
learning how to respect her more as a person. Elvin isn't the only character struggling to

32:33.440 --> 32:38.320
come to terms with gender politics, though. We see some of it in Theo in the season 2 episode,

32:38.320 --> 32:43.840
Theo and the Older Woman, when Theo develops a crush on Denise's friend, and he learns that she

32:43.840 --> 33:06.640
has a boyfriend. Theo doesn't take it well. Cliff has some decent advice for him.

33:13.840 --> 33:32.880
And the episode ends with Theo finding a potential new love interest,

33:32.880 --> 33:37.600
and taking an interest in his mother's garden as part of his process learning to understand

33:37.600 --> 33:42.720
women as more complex beings. I also appreciate how it reveals the attitudes men hold are often

33:42.720 --> 33:46.880
the real obstacle to these relationships flourishing, as women have no interest,

33:46.880 --> 33:52.000
nor should they, in reverting to their less active places in the world from the days of

33:52.000 --> 33:57.120
Cliff's youth. From its beginnings, the Cosby Show had no qualms dealing with sensitive topics

33:57.120 --> 34:02.480
surrounding gender discrimination, drugs, or other fare for more somber sitcom episodes,

34:02.480 --> 34:06.640
though quite noticeably there was one topic it rarely addressed head-on, and that was racial

34:06.640 --> 34:10.880
discrimination. In the earlier seasons, and throughout much of the series, race was very

34:10.880 --> 34:15.440
much a background aesthetic. References to culture included black authors, musicians,

34:15.440 --> 34:19.840
and other artists, and this was buttressed by the numerous episodes featuring guest appearances by

34:19.840 --> 34:24.720
black artists. This could be seen in episodes such as Play It Again, Russell, where Cliff's father

34:24.720 --> 34:29.280
overcomes some anxiety to play with a band he had been in years before, complete with a number of

34:29.280 --> 34:33.920
prominent, mostly black musicians backing him up. Although steeped in black culture, the Cosby Show

34:33.920 --> 34:38.720
had very little to say about racism of the day. In fact, most discussions surrounding racism and

34:38.720 --> 34:43.840
prejudice were framed as artists' backs from history. In one example, we see Russell with his

34:43.840 --> 34:47.600
old military friends telling stories about their time serving during World War II.

35:03.360 --> 35:07.360
And perhaps most compellingly, we hear stories from Cliff, Claire, and their respective parents

35:07.360 --> 35:12.400
about participating on the march on Washington as part of the Civil Rights Movement. The premise

35:12.400 --> 35:16.960
for this episode is that Thea's paper on the march was given a bad grade, as it merely recited a group

35:16.960 --> 35:21.440
of loose facts copied out of a book. His family offers him a different way to look at the events

35:21.440 --> 35:26.160
of that day, telling their own personal stories and experiences of attending the march.

35:37.360 --> 35:57.440
This was a really great episode, maybe my favorite of the first three seasons.

35:57.440 --> 36:00.960
It not only provides an interesting look at history, it also highlights the stories of the

36:00.960 --> 36:05.600
people who are part of it. History can sometimes be reduced to facts of events that took place,

36:05.680 --> 36:09.840
but a big part of why we care about history is because it affected real people, and hearing

36:09.840 --> 36:14.960
their first-hand stories and experiences gives life to those events. But much like other moments

36:14.960 --> 36:19.920
discussing racial discrimination in the series, it presents this struggle for racial equality as

36:19.920 --> 36:26.000
historic. Recent history, yes, but history nonetheless. It isn't connected to Theo's life,

36:26.000 --> 36:30.160
but rather presented as artifacts from the lives of his parents and grandparents. The fact that

36:30.160 --> 36:34.480
his parents were there should speak to how recent everything was, and give them an opportunity to

36:34.480 --> 36:38.800
connect that to Theo's life in the present. But aside from the great Theo gets on his paper,

36:38.800 --> 36:44.320
it wasn't connected to his life in a direct way. The episode on its own was lovely, but in the

36:44.320 --> 36:49.200
context of the Cosby Show more broadly, it sticks out, one of the few episodes to meaningfully

36:49.200 --> 36:53.840
discuss race in America, and if there had been others that looked at it contemporarily, it would

36:53.840 --> 36:58.240
have been fine. But as one of the few outliers, it doesn't do the subject justice from the context

36:58.240 --> 37:03.840
of a discussion in the 1980s. This series aired alongside movies such as Spike Lee's Do the Right

37:03.840 --> 37:08.640
Thing and music from Public Enemy, so these discussions were certainly happening. The Cosby

37:08.640 --> 37:13.760
Show simply chose not to participate in them. The Cosby Show of course didn't need to be doing deep

37:13.760 --> 37:19.200
dives on racial dynamics in 1980s America, but by not saying anything, it tacitly endorsed something

37:19.200 --> 37:24.000
else. It reinforced the idea of colorblindness. The depiction of race on the show was very much

37:24.000 --> 37:28.400
a concern for Bill Cosby while working on the series, so much so that he brought in professor

37:28.400 --> 37:33.520
of psychiatry Alvin F. Poussaint to consult on it. According to Dr. Poussaint, he provided feedback

37:33.520 --> 37:38.000
on every script and how accurately he believed it reflected a realistic portrayal of a black

37:38.000 --> 37:44.800
family. The trouble with the white writers was not so much they were racist. It was that they didn't

37:44.800 --> 37:51.280
have the experience. They didn't know the context of what they were writing about. He also reflected

37:51.280 --> 37:55.520
some very real concerns regarding representation of black performance of different skin tones and

37:55.520 --> 38:01.360
hair types. The sun, Theo, and I saw three or four dates and they were all light-skinned,

38:01.360 --> 38:08.640
straight-haired black women. I said, Bill, who's casting these people? Bill went to the casting

38:08.640 --> 38:14.000
director and said, I want you to get some dates for Theo and I want them to be pretty.

38:16.320 --> 38:23.680
That's all he said. And the casting director said, oh, pretty, light skin, straight hair.

38:24.560 --> 38:29.760
The one that came to depictions of overt racism, Dr. Poussaint stood alongside Bill Cosby in removing

38:29.760 --> 38:35.920
or downplaying them within the context of the show. Bill said, that's like kind of corny,

38:35.920 --> 38:40.720
straight stuff. He said, let's just show that she's really smart and the white people,

38:40.720 --> 38:44.880
white lawyers interviewing her are jerks. While later seasons would introduce some more

38:44.880 --> 38:49.360
thoughtful considerations about race, the early seasons were very much concerned with avoiding

38:49.360 --> 38:53.760
presenting scenes where the Huxtables were victims of any sort of racial discrimination.

38:53.760 --> 38:58.400
The emphasis was squarely on presenting positive images of a black family and by that positive

38:58.400 --> 39:03.040
example undermining racism within society. One limitation of that approach is described by

39:03.040 --> 39:08.160
sociologist Stuart Hall when he wrote, the problem with the positive-negative strategy is that adding

39:08.160 --> 39:13.440
positive images to the largely negative repertoire of the dominant regime of representation increases

39:13.440 --> 39:18.080
the diversity of ways in which being black is represented but does not necessarily displace

39:18.080 --> 39:22.720
the negative. The Cosby Show's early seasons effectively reinforce the concept of the binary

39:22.800 --> 39:28.880
of good and bad black representation on television by becoming the good ones. This reflects the

39:28.880 --> 39:33.520
conservative values of the show. Although it may very well be aware of systemic challenges that a

39:33.520 --> 39:38.080
black family faces, it does little to suggest changing that system aside from working within

39:38.080 --> 39:42.480
the system's framework to create a better life for one's self and one's family. It reinforces

39:42.480 --> 39:46.960
the idea that the American dream is in reach for black families so long as they play by the rules.

39:47.600 --> 39:51.840
This is reflected in a speech given by Theo in the first season where he's accepted an award

39:51.840 --> 40:01.200
for Cliff. One aspect of black culture the Cosby Show emphasized was the importance of

40:01.200 --> 40:05.920
historically black colleges, very much fitting in with Cosby's well-worn refrain of emphasizing

40:05.920 --> 40:10.720
education. It became a major plot point for Denise, particularly when it came to discussions

40:10.720 --> 40:15.600
surrounding which post-secondary school she would attend. Cliff and his father very much

40:15.600 --> 40:32.800
want Denise to attend Hillman, their alma mater. Eventually by the end of season two in the episode

40:32.800 --> 40:38.160
Denise's decision Denise decides that she will attend Hillman. This school had everything that

40:38.160 --> 40:45.120
I wanted and it also produced some very special people who went on to do great things including

40:45.120 --> 40:54.880
having me. Denise goes off to school in season three though she still makes regular appearances

40:54.880 --> 40:59.040
on the show as part of the cast. We even have an episode that sees the Huxtable family attend a

40:59.040 --> 41:03.840
ceremony honoring the retirement of Hillman's president. This episode marked the end of one

41:03.840 --> 41:08.240
era of the Cosby Show bringing with it a whole new world in the shape of a spin-off.

41:08.240 --> 41:18.880
Starting in season four Lisa Bonet left the Cosby Show and would star a spin-off series titled

41:18.880 --> 41:23.840
A Different World which had a backdoor pilot in the finale to the season three episode titled

41:23.840 --> 41:29.040
Hillman. It would be set at a fictional historical black college following the trials of Denise

41:29.040 --> 41:33.600
Huxtable trying to achieve a higher education. This was not the first time a backdoor pilot

41:33.600 --> 41:38.880
appeared on the Cosby Show. In season one the episode Mr. Quiet served as a backdoor pilot for

41:38.880 --> 41:43.280
a series starring Tony Orlando about a community center though it didn't quite capture enough

41:43.280 --> 41:48.560
attention to become a series. On the other hand A Different World which was created by Bill Cosby

41:48.560 --> 41:53.440
made a huge splash reaching number two in the ratings in its first season following its lead-in

41:53.440 --> 41:58.480
program which was naturally the Cosby Show. The school has been identified as being modeled on

41:58.480 --> 42:04.160
the historically black colleges Howard, Hampton, Spellman, and Morehouse. The last two most likely

42:04.160 --> 42:08.560
because exterior shots of the school were done at Spellman and Morehouse. A Different World using

42:08.560 --> 42:13.600
the comfortable lead of Denise Huxtable introduced audiences to a cast with more diverse backgrounds

42:13.600 --> 42:17.920
than what they were seeing on the Cosby Show whereas the Huxtables lived a comfortable middle

42:17.920 --> 42:22.320
class life with standard sitcom concerns. A Different World had black students from across

42:22.320 --> 42:26.720
America representing a number of different experiences many of them evolving over the

42:26.720 --> 42:32.320
years to become thoughtful, insightful portrayals. Denise was joined by her two roommates Jaleesa

42:32.320 --> 42:38.320
played by Don Lewis and Maggie played by Marisa Tomei. Mary Alice as Letitia and Loretta Divine

42:38.320 --> 42:43.040
as Stevie took turns as the dorm directors in the first season and the final two members of the first

42:43.040 --> 42:48.640
season's principal cast were the oh so memorable pair of Whitley played by Jasmine Guy and Dwayne

42:48.640 --> 42:53.200
played by Kadeem Hardison. A Different World is probably most fondly remembered for its life after

42:53.360 --> 42:57.360
its first season though when Lisa Bonet exited the series and the show was put in the hands of Debbie

42:57.360 --> 43:02.800
Allen, an alumna of Howard University and the real-life sister of Felicia Rashad. Darryl Bell and

43:02.800 --> 43:08.320
Sinbad were promoted from reoccurring roles to the principal cast where they were joined by newcomers

43:08.320 --> 43:14.400
Sharnell Brown, Kree Summer, Glenn Terman, and Lou Myers and perhaps most importantly the characters

43:14.400 --> 43:19.360
Whitley and Dwayne were placed front and center with their romantic subplot being a major drive

43:19.360 --> 43:23.040
in the series throughout the rest of its run. A Different World was lauded for being all the

43:23.040 --> 43:28.240
things the Cosby Show wasn't. It provided a voice to a variety of black experiences in America and

43:28.240 --> 43:32.880
didn't shy away for controversial issues such as homelessness, date rape, and was one of the first

43:32.880 --> 43:37.760
TV shows to touch on the growing AIDS epidemic of the 1980s. It was also credited with raising

43:37.760 --> 43:42.960
interest in historically black colleges. The series also broke stereotypes with Whitley probably being

43:42.960 --> 43:48.000
the first southern bell portrayed by a black actress and Dwayne Wayne, a name so cool you have

43:48.080 --> 43:53.600
to say the whole thing, being a hip guy who also happens to be a math whiz many years before the

43:53.600 --> 43:58.800
geek chic thing became a trend. Not completely cut off from its spin-off roots, The Huxstables made

43:58.800 --> 44:03.840
several guest appearances on the show, even after Lisa Bonet departed the series. Every member of

44:03.840 --> 44:09.120
The Huxstable family made at least two appearances, albeit mostly in the first season. Though Felicia

44:09.120 --> 44:14.480
Rashad, who appeared in four episodes, showed up in season two or later, Lisa Bonet even made a

44:14.480 --> 44:18.800
brief return to the show for one episode in season three. Ahead of a different world's premiere,

44:18.800 --> 44:23.600
Lisa Bonet's entry into the series did not seem entirely voluntary. In an interview with David

44:23.600 --> 44:28.000
Letterman, she explained how she ended up on the show. And you're also getting your own,

44:28.000 --> 44:32.240
you have your own pilot being spun off this Cosby thing. Yeah. Now, what is that about? Why would

44:32.240 --> 44:39.600
you want to do that? Because they told me to. Although Bonet has not gone into detail about

44:39.600 --> 44:43.760
her time on the show, reports from those who worked on the Cosby Show cited difficulties between her

44:43.760 --> 44:48.560
and Bill Cosby, with her constantly resisting Cosby's need to control each part of the series.

44:48.560 --> 44:52.800
Bonet's departure from a different world was largely driven by her pregnancy. Debbie Allen

44:52.800 --> 44:56.880
wanted to keep Denise as a character on the show, thinking a single mother would introduce a fresh

44:56.880 --> 45:06.000
dynamic. But Bill Cosby thought otherwise. He says, you know what, Debbie? No. She's pregnant.

45:06.000 --> 45:13.120
Denise Huxstable is not pregnant. Lisa Bonet is pregnant, not Denise. So no, no, you can't have

45:13.200 --> 45:18.720
it. No, we're not going to do it. No. So he took her back. I was so mad at him. I wanted to take

45:18.720 --> 45:23.280
her, but I understood he just wanted her back. Lisa Bonet would remain a recurring star on the

45:23.280 --> 45:27.760
Cosby Show on season five and would resume her full time status in season six.

45:33.520 --> 45:38.320
Sandra and Elvin began season four as newlyweds, having announced their engagement in season three

45:38.320 --> 45:42.320
and having been married in between the seasons. Although seemingly following in the footsteps of

45:42.400 --> 45:46.640
Cliff and Claire, with Elvin going to med school and Sandra going to law school, the two instead

45:46.640 --> 45:52.320
decide to drop out of school and open a wilderness store, which is, as best I could tell, a store to

45:52.320 --> 45:56.720
buy camping supplies at. The couple decides to rent their first home together, and it similarly

45:56.720 --> 46:02.640
does not inspire confidence in the Huxstable parents. Well, what do you think? So this is it.

46:03.280 --> 46:09.600
Dad? It's an apartment, all right. Mom, dad, have a seat. Make yourselves at home. Thank you.

46:09.600 --> 46:10.880
Thank you very much.

46:18.320 --> 46:21.840
The couple go from grad students to working class in the blink of an eye,

46:21.840 --> 46:26.480
though what seems like a fun new premise is short-lived, as by the time season five rolls around

46:26.480 --> 46:30.480
and Elvin and Sandra have their first two children, Elvin reconsiders his decision to

46:30.480 --> 46:34.000
leave medical school. They looked at them and they looked at me and I looked at her.

46:34.000 --> 46:44.640
And then it came to me. I made a decision. Mom, dad, everybody. I'm going back to medical school.

46:48.480 --> 46:52.240
And although Sandra doesn't have a similar scene, she eventually decides to go back to law school

46:52.240 --> 46:57.440
as well. As a side note, the twins are named Winnie and Nelson, and while it's not explicitly

46:57.440 --> 47:01.040
mentioned in the show, the names are of the bandellas who were in the middle of the battle

47:01.040 --> 47:06.080
against apartheid in South Africa. This wasn't the only subtle show of solidarity, as Bill Cosby

47:06.080 --> 47:11.040
apparently had to fight with the network for a sticker that read abolish apartheid to appear on

47:11.040 --> 47:15.840
the door of Theo's bedroom. Season five opened with the episode together again and again,

47:15.840 --> 47:19.600
with Denise returning from college for the summer and then eventually revealing she was

47:19.600 --> 47:24.640
planning to drop out. What are you worried about? You're going back to him. No, I'm not. Yeah,

47:24.640 --> 47:30.960
get serious. I am. I'm dropping out of school. What? With no major prospects on the horizon,

47:30.960 --> 47:35.520
Denise moves back home with her parents. In the same episode, Theo, who is beginning his first

47:35.520 --> 47:39.840
year at NYU, reveals that he forgot to mail the check for his dorm room, meaning he'll need a

47:39.840 --> 47:47.680
place to stay. I said to you, son, don't forget to mail this. And you said no problem. And I went

47:47.680 --> 47:57.360
right out and mailed it. I'm almost positive. And of course, this means one more Huxtable

47:57.360 --> 48:05.600
Kid staying at home. It is believable that this boy deliberately did not mail that envelope so

48:05.600 --> 48:11.280
that when he went down, there were no rooms that he would have to come back here and live. It is

48:11.280 --> 48:17.360
believable that Denise does not want to go to college anymore because she wants to live here.

48:17.360 --> 48:25.840
It is believable that this young man and this woman living in a condemned place on purpose

48:27.120 --> 48:33.520
have this baby to make us feel sorry for them so they can come back here. In all three of these

48:33.520 --> 48:38.000
cases, the Huxtable Kids are portrayed as having their lives in a bit of a mess. Something that

48:38.000 --> 48:42.080
seems surprising when compared to how the early seasons seem to suggest that Cliff and Claire

48:42.080 --> 48:46.160
were setting up their children for success. All those heart-to-heart talks encouraging them to

48:46.160 --> 48:50.400
work hard, set goals for themselves, and plan for the future blow up the second they enter the real

48:50.400 --> 48:54.400
world. And what ultimately keeps things from spiraling out of control for them is that they

48:54.400 --> 48:59.920
have parents to bail them out. Not with words of wisdom, but with material support. Sondra and

48:59.920 --> 49:04.800
Elvin get a loan for their apartment, while Denise and Theo get room and board. None of this, of

49:04.800 --> 49:09.520
course, should be seen as condemning the Huxtables, but it does highlight a very important part of the

49:09.520 --> 49:13.920
equation when it comes to their success in parenting. Growing up means making mistakes,

49:13.920 --> 49:18.240
and sometimes those mistakes can have very real costs. The crucial difference here is that the

49:18.240 --> 49:22.320
Huxtables can afford it when their kids make mistakes. One of the stated goals of the series

49:22.320 --> 49:27.120
was to provide a positive example of parenting for families, but this positive example requires a

49:27.120 --> 49:32.080
degree of material comfort that isn't realistic for a lot of families. Even before the Huxtable

49:32.080 --> 49:36.800
Kids made mistakes, they still had their education paid for, a stable home, and were never in serious

49:36.800 --> 49:42.080
want of anything. It's the sort of life any kid should have, but sadly many don't. If the early

49:42.080 --> 49:45.920
seasons were presenting the Huxtable Kids in a bubble, no serious peril could ever pierce,

49:45.920 --> 49:50.480
these seasons show the kids growing up into a more hostile world, but with the safety net of parents

49:50.480 --> 49:55.200
who are able to provide material assistance. Denise exits the show for a second time in the

49:55.200 --> 50:00.400
season 5 episode out of Brooklyn, where she gets a job alongside a photojournalist taking her to

50:00.400 --> 50:05.120
Africa. Oh, I am so excited. You guys, don't worry about me. I'm gonna be fine. I know where I'm

50:05.120 --> 50:10.560
going is gonna be difficult and rugged, but the most difficult part is gonna be being away from

50:10.560 --> 50:15.120
you guys. I have always loved the sitcom trope of sending a character to the other side of the

50:15.120 --> 50:19.680
world to explain why we don't see them for the next 21 episodes of the season. It can't be

50:19.680 --> 50:24.400
understated how important Claire Huxtable is to the family dynamic. Cliff's antics tend to get

50:24.400 --> 50:29.280
a lot of screen time, with Cosby making such a meal of his lines that it drifts into parody.

50:29.280 --> 50:36.080
I shall lead with the queen of going to the garden and get the spain.

50:36.080 --> 50:44.480
Felish Rashad takes control of scenes in a more quiet and controlled way. The show seems very

50:44.480 --> 50:49.920
cognizant of the angry black woman trope, where black women are portrayed as being overly sassy

50:49.920 --> 50:55.360
and ill-tempered as some kind of innate quality. Claire's character completely rejects that trope

50:55.360 --> 51:01.120
by always being the calm voice of reason in most situations. In the season 5 episode, Mrs. Huxtable

51:01.120 --> 51:05.840
goes to kindergarten, Claire is invited to join a Saturday morning TV show panel in which current

51:05.920 --> 51:10.400
events are discussed. Her fellow panelists are taken aback at how capable she is in holding her

51:10.400 --> 51:14.400
own in the heated debate. The Depression was still ravaging the nation when the stock market

51:14.400 --> 51:20.000
began to recover. In my opinion, the crash was a precipitating event. That is the most ridiculous

51:20.000 --> 51:26.080
thing I ever heard. I wouldn't call her opinion ridiculous, a bit naive. My opinion is neither

51:26.080 --> 51:30.480
naive nor ridiculous in how the Sam Hill you expect to have a discussion if all points of

51:30.480 --> 51:36.320
view are not taken into consideration. And we see a rare, and possibly only example of someone in

51:36.320 --> 51:42.320
the Huxtable household facing racism. We're trying to broaden our viewership. Fine, then let her speak

51:42.320 --> 51:48.080
when we get to the black topics. Excuse me, the black topics. Is that what I'm here to do,

51:48.080 --> 51:54.000
talk about the black topics? No, you're also here to speak for women. Oh, that's nice. I am a woman

51:54.000 --> 51:59.280
who is black, but I'm also a human being who is an attorney, a mother of five, and somewhat knowledgeable

51:59.280 --> 52:03.360
about history, which is why I thought I was invited here. In that moment, Claire is reduced

52:03.360 --> 52:08.080
to her identity in a way that invalidates her individual experiences, and her response,

52:08.080 --> 52:13.280
instead of becoming indignant, is to hold herself to her own standard of behavior. I'm afraid we

52:13.280 --> 52:18.560
only have 30 seconds left. In that time, could you please tell us what effect the Depression had on

52:18.560 --> 52:27.200
the blacks? You want me to sum that up in 30 seconds. We learned that misery does not love

52:27.200 --> 52:31.520
company. Another great part about this episode is how Cliff watched all of this happening in the

52:31.520 --> 52:36.080
green room, confident that his wife could handle herself through the experience. She eventually

52:36.080 --> 52:40.640
leaves the show in spite of efforts from the producers to keep her. Getting up at 4 30 in the

52:40.640 --> 52:45.280
morning to prove who I am to three men who are basking in the non-existent rays of their own

52:45.280 --> 52:50.720
intelligence is not my idea of a fun time. What was interesting about this episode is that it

52:50.720 --> 52:55.440
showed a type of casual racism, and it does so among an educated class of people you might have

52:55.440 --> 53:00.480
assumed knew better. And it stretches across the political spectrum, with the panelists being both

53:00.480 --> 53:06.160
from the right and left. But perhaps most striking is how Claire can somehow rise above that. Her

53:06.160 --> 53:10.400
behavior isn't surprising. She's behaving the way you would have expected her to having watched her

53:10.400 --> 53:14.880
for over four seasons, but it flies in the face of a caricature she could have become. And one of

53:14.880 --> 53:18.800
the few times we see Claire get upset, it's rare enough that it can be accepted as her just being

53:18.800 --> 53:21.520
fed up with her kids in an exceptional moment.

53:21.600 --> 53:25.600
Son, this is a wilderness. Denise is in the jungle, and she's on the locomotion.

53:28.640 --> 53:32.560
Before the mothers come in here and see me, they'll be blaming me. Yeah,

53:32.560 --> 53:37.120
running around here dressed in nothing, jumping around like they just hopped off the hot seat.

53:37.120 --> 53:42.320
Suppose some fool comes along, sees that, takes them seriously. Vanessa could end up on a stage

53:42.320 --> 53:47.120
somewhere across the country cliff in a smoked field cafe, singing and dancing and gyrating

53:47.120 --> 53:51.040
like that. And I won't be around to take the tissues out then. I'm not.

53:51.040 --> 53:55.680
Claire's outrage in that moment doesn't set the character back, because we know this isn't

53:55.680 --> 54:00.160
something she usually does. And even this rare display of anger still feels like a part of the

54:00.160 --> 54:05.280
character. And part of why it does is because Claire always feels authentic. In the episode

54:05.280 --> 54:09.520
Birthday Blues, we get a taste of that as Claire deals with her kids thinking she'll be far more

54:09.520 --> 54:15.200
fragile than she is on her 46th birthday. Mom, I apologize for your daughter's insensitivity. I

54:15.200 --> 54:19.280
asked them not to bring up your age because I knew it would be rough on you. But it's not

54:19.280 --> 54:24.240
rough for me. I love being 46. I think it's a lovely age. So do I. You look good for your age.

54:26.480 --> 54:32.640
Thank you. No, I mean it. You really look good. Yeah, Mom, you really look good. Really?

54:34.400 --> 54:41.920
Thank you. And Cliff's behavior isn't much better. You still look good. Now, why did you use that

54:41.920 --> 54:47.520
word still? You didn't use to talk like that. You used to say, Claire, you look good. Am I not

54:47.520 --> 54:54.000
supposed to look good? You're absolutely correct. The word still is out. You look good.

54:55.440 --> 54:59.840
The fixation on Claire's appearance seems to annoy her more than whether or not she still has it at

54:59.840 --> 55:04.240
46. Part of that confidence may come from her knowing she still has it, but more importantly,

55:04.240 --> 55:08.400
she just seems so at ease with who she is. It projects a confidence in herself that makes

55:08.400 --> 55:13.440
everything she does seem so real. Even if it sometimes makes Claire seem almost superhuman

55:13.440 --> 55:17.600
with how she walks through her life, she's just flawed enough to be a vision of what it might be

55:17.600 --> 55:28.000
to succeed in the world. Season 6 brought with it some major changes to the show with its premiere,

55:28.000 --> 55:32.960
Denise, The Saga Continues. It featured the return of Lisa Bonet to the principal cast,

55:32.960 --> 55:37.280
and she brought two new members with her. The first is Joseph C. Phillips, playing Denise's

55:37.360 --> 55:52.800
new husband, Martin. The second is three-year-old Raven Simone, who played Denise's new stepdaughter,

55:52.800 --> 55:56.960
Olivia. Olivia, honey, this is the house where Denise grew up.

55:56.960 --> 56:10.480
The Huxtables are completely unaware of Denise's recent nuptials, and are even less ready for this

56:10.480 --> 56:15.040
new family to move into their home. But once again, the Huxtable household is filled with life,

56:15.040 --> 56:18.880
introducing some new storyline potential. You might have assumed this new dynamic would give

56:18.880 --> 56:24.160
Lisa Bonet some new storylines, but Denise's character seems unfocused and inconsistent,

56:24.160 --> 56:28.800
not just in her exploits, but the show doesn't seem to know what to do with her character at

56:28.800 --> 56:32.960
this point. If anything, these new additions actually open the door for Raven Simone to

56:32.960 --> 56:36.720
really shine, as Olivia soon becomes one of the most prominent members of the cast.

56:54.160 --> 56:58.800
Lisa Bonet would depart from the show part of the way through season 7, and would not return at all

56:58.800 --> 57:03.920
for season 8. Phillips would lead the principal cast in season 7 as well, but did still appear

57:03.920 --> 57:08.720
as a guest star in one season 8 episode. Olivia, however, would be a big part of the series right

57:08.720 --> 57:13.680
up to its final episode. The in-show reason for Olivia's parents' departure was explained as Martin

57:13.680 --> 57:18.400
being stationed in various parts of East Asia and Denise wanting to be with him. They decided Olivia

57:18.400 --> 57:22.960
would be best off stage with the Huxtables. The one season 8 episode that Phillips returned to

57:22.960 --> 57:26.800
perform in allowed Martin to have an interesting episode with his daughter.

57:52.960 --> 57:59.920
Martin's departure in that final appearance was a good episode about a family being something

57:59.920 --> 58:04.160
more than your immediate relations, and it's one of the few episodes using Olivia that resonated

58:04.160 --> 58:08.720
beyond what we had already seen, with Cliff playing with other children. Lisa Bonet's return

58:08.720 --> 58:12.640
and eventual final departure made some news at the time, but another controversy that hit the

58:12.640 --> 58:17.440
series during this period was about the opening credits for season 7. Each season of the Cosby

58:17.440 --> 58:22.320
show quite noticeably used unique credit sequences for each season, each featuring the cast dancing

58:22.320 --> 58:26.960
to a different version of his opening theme, Kiss Me. Depending on which opening you were seeing or

58:26.960 --> 58:31.760
hearing, you could tell which season was airing. Originally, season 7 opened with the cast dancing

58:31.760 --> 58:37.040
in front of a mural inspired by another mural titled Straight of Dreams, painted by inner city

58:37.040 --> 58:42.960
kids from the Creative Arts Workshop in Harlem. The workshop director, Brookie Maxwell, argued that

58:42.960 --> 58:47.600
the kids should get credit for the mural and, in response, Cosby pulled the intro for season 7

58:48.320 --> 58:53.040
instead using a slightly altered version of the season 6 opening. Eventually, a compromise was

58:53.040 --> 58:58.240
reached regarding use of the mural, and the intro for season 7 was used for season 8, with credit

58:58.240 --> 59:04.320
going to 63 young artists in the show's closing credits. In earlier seasons of the Cosby show,

59:04.320 --> 59:08.720
much of the episodes about Vanessa focused on her dating life and escapades with her friends.

59:08.720 --> 59:13.200
Most of these episodes were pretty tame, and pretty standard stuff for a sitcom. For example,

59:13.280 --> 59:18.240
in season 5's Truth or Consequences, we see Vanessa nearly have sex with her boyfriend at the time,

59:18.240 --> 59:22.960
Jeremy. Jeremy comes off as a bit of a creep, clearly trying to manipulate Vanessa, but she

59:22.960 --> 59:26.960
stands up for herself thanks to her parents instilling her with good values, and all is well

59:26.960 --> 59:31.920
in the huckstable world. In other words, a typical episode. By the time the seventh season rolled

59:31.920 --> 59:36.240
around, Bledsoe's role on the show was reduced. The in-show reason was that Vanessa had excelled

59:36.240 --> 59:40.800
in school so much she was skipped four years so she could attend college. The real-world version

59:40.800 --> 59:44.960
was similar in that Tempest Bledsoe wanted to attend college, and with some encouragement

59:44.960 --> 59:48.720
from Bill Cosby, arrangements were made so she could attend full-time while still being a part

59:48.720 --> 59:52.880
of the show. Bledsoe's accommodation seems to be one of the few that was given enthusiastically

59:52.880 --> 59:57.200
by Cosby, likely due to the emphasis he had always placed on kids getting an education.

59:57.200 --> 01:00:01.680
Although Bledsoe was still attending NYU's Stern School of Business, Vanessa made a surprising

01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:07.360
return in season 8 with a new character in tow, her fiancé played by William Thomas Jr. with the

01:00:07.440 --> 01:00:10.240
unforgettable name of Dabness Brickie.

01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.760
The sudden engagement kept secret for six months, and the two of them only having known

01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:36.560
each other for a year is made even more surprising when we learn that the 18-year-old Vanessa

01:00:36.560 --> 01:00:48.720
is planning to marry a 30-year-old Dabness. We learn some other stuff about Dabness,

01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.640
such as having served in the military and being the head of maintenance at the College Vanessa

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.360
is attending. The approval of the Huxtables isn't easily won by Dabness, and there's this

01:00:57.360 --> 01:01:01.920
undercurrent of snobbery whenever his financial status is brought up. Although Cliff and Claire

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:04.000
insist they aren't bothered by his job.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:39.680
The Huxtables are concerned that Vanessa isn't ready for marriage,

01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:44.560
which we do eventually learn is true, but when Claire says she was concerned that Vanessa kept

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:49.440
Dabness a secret, she pivots away from Vanessa's explanation that she thought her parents would

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:55.840
judge him by his job by simply saying that it's lame. It raises the issue that, for six months,

01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.080
Vanessa never felt comfortable mentioning she had a new boyfriend who happened to be a maintenance

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:05.120
man. And while the Huxtables can claim it doesn't bother them, Dabness's job and his perceived lack

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:10.000
of wealth is still used as a punchline. Here's how some of the family reacts to Vanessa's engagement

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:37.360
ring. I felt so bad for Dabness in that moment.

01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:42.320
He isn't a lawyer or a doctor, and maybe he didn't have wealthy parents to pay his way through

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.360
school, but the way his job is used as a punchline undercuts whatever Cliff or Claire might say about

01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:52.240
not judging him based on that. We eventually see Cliff soften to Dabness, but only when he finds

01:02:52.240 --> 01:03:16.640
out he has his own house. Eventually, Dabness wins over the entire family, largely on account

01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.360
of being a decent guy who happens to be handy around the house. The wedding never comes to

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:26.480
pass, as the engagement is eventually called off when Vanessa refuses to set a date. And we have

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:42.160
this cute little moment where Dabness unloads to Cliff. Dabness does show up for the series finale,

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:46.480
leaving the door open for him and Vanessa getting back together, but we never get closure on this

01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:52.000
romance. What's frustrating about this plotline is how little we get a sense of what Vanessa wants.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.400
The anxiety over how Vanessa thinks her parents will react takes some of the earlier episodes,

01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.480
where the opinions of the Huxtables are presented as a guidepost to good behavior,

01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:05.200
and we see how the shadow of those expectations leave Vanessa to react impulsively. This makes

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.760
season 8 a bit more interesting, as it's one of the rare instances where the parental advice

01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:15.040
actually backfires. It shows some drawbacks to the Huxtable method, and makes the whole family

01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:20.240
seem a little more flawed and relatable as a result. In earlier seasons, a Rudy-centric episode

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:24.480
would typically be about something very low stakes, such as the season 4 episode, It Ain't

01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.480
Easy Being Green, where Rudy insists on wearing summer clothes to a fall party.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:49.600
Cliff resolves this with a compromise, letting Rudy choose her clothes out of a selection of

01:04:49.600 --> 01:05:03.760
fall clothing. Although stakes of this episode work really well, because Rudy is eight,

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:07.120
and something so small as not choosing her clothes would seem like a big deal to her,

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:12.240
and the resolution, letting Rudy have slightly more control over her life, is sensible and sweet.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:17.200
In later seasons though, Rudy's storylines began to evolve. We see Rudy becoming a stronger,

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:22.160
more assertive character, and what makes that readily apparent in later seasons is thanks to,

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:28.320
in no small part, the introduction of her friend Kenny, also known as Bud, played by Dion Richmond.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:50.080
Third Dynamic is initially just for cute moments where Rudy has to assert her strong personality

01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:52.080
after Kenny says something incredibly stupid.

01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:28.000
They're cute little moments, but they evolve into something so much more. Most of the

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:32.240
interactions the hostable kids have with the opposite gender are usually done in the context

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:36.880
of dating. This is partially true of Rudy in later seasons, as we see her start to enter the dating

01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:12.960
world, but Rudy and Kenny's relationship takes a different path. Although them becoming a couple

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:18.160
is teased at in the earlier seasons, by the time season 8 rolls around, we see Rudy instead dating

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:23.520
a new character, Stanley, played by Merlin Santana. Kenny takes exception to the new couple,

01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:25.680
and does whatever he can to undermine them.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:46.000
Kenny goes so far as to fake having a girlfriend in an effort to make Rudy jealous,

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.360
though eventually an important lesson about friendship is learned.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:14.080
He's just that he's always there. Sorry I acted like a jerk to him.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.080
That's okay, I acted like one too. So what happened to Deidre?

01:08:18.640 --> 01:08:21.360
I walked her home. Said she got me tomorrow if I called her.

01:08:21.360 --> 01:08:22.560
Are you gonna call her?

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:23.360
Oh yeah.

01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:26.480
Guess you're gonna have to call somebody sometime.

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.760
Yeah, now you and I have something coming again.

01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.200
Well, I'm happy for you.

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:34.720
I'm happy for me too. I'm happy for you.

01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:38.640
So does this mean you won't be tagging along with me and Stanley anymore?

01:08:38.640 --> 01:08:39.600
Well, I'll be tagging.

01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.720
I'll just have Deidre with me.

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.200
We'll double.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.240
I really like how this friendship blossomed between Rudy and Kenny.

01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:52.640
Girls and boys should be able to be friends, even with the messiness of a one-sided attraction.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:55.760
How you see someone one day isn't how you'll see them for the rest of your life,

01:08:55.760 --> 01:09:00.080
and learning how to grow past someone who isn't interested is a great sign of maturity and growth.

01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:04.880
Being able to do this at 13 seems like a stretch, especially considering the attitudes towards

01:09:04.880 --> 01:09:08.160
women Kenny was carrying with him, but it's still a positive message.

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:12.880
In the 90s, a decade this show was just entering, there was still a lot of confusion about the way

01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:16.640
evolving gender dynamics would influence relationships, and Kenny's advice on his

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.840
brother representing an older, easier way of looking at them.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:24.640
The Cosby Show uses the strength of Rudy as a female character to challenge these assumptions,

01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.000
and create a new script that lets everyone find some happiness,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.640
and not have the world warp to fit the desires of Kenny.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.120
It also means Rudy didn't have to choose between dating someone she likes and keeping one of our

01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:35.840
oldest friends.

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.520
As the Cosby Show reached its seventh season, it was starting to show signs of waning popularity.

01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:45.920
ABC's Roseanne was gradually gaining ground, and the Cosby Show's dominance on Thursday nights

01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.000
was about to be challenged by a serious contender, The Simpsons, on Fox.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.480
Season 7's premiere was one of the only episodes of the Cosby Show to begin with a cold opening,

01:09:54.480 --> 01:09:56.720
acknowledging the series' new rival.

01:09:56.720 --> 01:10:01.040
In the first weeks of competition, there was much discussion about The Simpsons beating the

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.480
Cosby Show in key markets.

01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:06.640
However, by the end of the year, The Cosby Show would still finish well ahead of The Simpsons.

01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:10.480
Even with The Cosby Show holding onto the crown of its Thursday night time slot,

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.480
it still had a fall in the overall ratings.

01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:16.640
Breaking its streak of five consecutive years as the number one show in the United States,

01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.920
it would finish its seventh season as the fifth most watched show, and by its eighth season,

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.320
it would fall to 18th, right behind its own spin-off, A Different World.

01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:30.160
The new challenge to its dominance hadn't been ignored, though, and The Cosby Show made a big

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:32.880
addition in its seventh season to keep people interested.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:39.440
It introduced a new member to the family, Claire's cousin, Pam Tucker, played by Erika Alexander.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:43.440
Pam grew up in a single-parent household, and she joined the Huxtables when her mother

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.440
was forced to leave New York to take care of Pam's grandmother in California.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.920
Pam stayed behind to finish her high school education,

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.280
and the Huxtables offered to take her in so she'd have a place to stay.

01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.640
Pam's background of being working class brought a new dynamic to the show,

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.480
a regular cast member who led a very non-Hux-table kind of life.

01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:04.400
Pam appeared alongside some friends, Karen Molina White as Charmaine,

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.200
Alan Payne as Lance, and Michonne Lee as Slide, Pam's boyfriend.

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.120
The impression these teens have of the Huxtable home reveals the class dynamics at play.

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:50.400
But a few words from the Huxtables settle everyone down.

01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:16.080
And very quickly, we get a sense of what this show's new dynamic will be like.

01:12:16.080 --> 01:12:20.320
Pam is coming from a poorer neighborhood, but it isn't just the wealth that's going to change

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:23.520
her life, it's the strong influence of the Huxtables themselves.

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.400
One thing I appreciated about Pam's appearance is that there's no judgment about her family,

01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:31.280
such as lines about her mother being an unfit parent.

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:35.600
All we see is an acknowledgement about that her life has certainly been a tougher one.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:39.680
Pam's storylines often felt very different than the ones impacting the Huxtable kids.

01:12:39.680 --> 01:12:42.480
For example, we had seen Vanessa being pressured into having sex,

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:47.920
but it didn't compare to the pressure Pam faced in Season 7 in the two-parter just thinking about it.

01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:57.320
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,

01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:06.320
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:13.320
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.320
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam,

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.320
Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, Pam, answering, answering, answering, answering, answering, answering, answering, answering.

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.320
Although Pam and Sly get back together, it wouldn't last

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.480
and they would eventually break up for good.

01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:31.320
Pam would soon be dated a new character named Aaron, played by Seth Gilliam.

01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:34.600
Do you speak French? I do a little, actually a lot.

01:13:34.600 --> 01:13:36.800
Not because I am smart, I just studied it in school.

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:38.240
Anybody can do that, it's not like I'm the smartest guy in class.

01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:40.360
You're not? No.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:44.320
There are at least... 4 other people smarter than me. Well, maybe 3.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.600
Pam's new love interest more closely resembles the world of the Huxtables.

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:52.920
It symbolizes how Pam is changing in the series, taking on the characteristics of her new household.

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:58.840
Although there's no judgment of Pam or her background, the show makes the subtle argument that, for Pam to be happy,

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:00.840
she needs to live more like the Huxtables.

01:14:01.040 --> 01:14:06.200
We see this in her academic life as she goes from being indifferent to school to working hard to get better grades.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.440
You know when I first came here, you people didn't look all that good to me.

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:24.600
But you welcomed me, made me feel at home, gave me curfew.

01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:30.600
Just in case I do decide to go to college, I'm studying.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.600
But Pam might not be able to afford to go to college after all.

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:39.600
Well, dear, if she's gonna go to college, how's she gonna pay for it?

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.600
Oh, that's the least of her worries.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.600
Oh, I beg your pardon?

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.600
That'd be silly. She'll work.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600
She's gonna work.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.600
She can work like I did. She can work in the post office like I did.

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:54.600
Dear, you worked in the post office during the Christmas holidays.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.600
The episode's final moments make us sit with that question, watching Pam get down to study.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.600
But to what end?

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:04.600
Claire seemed strangely ambivalent, as if things will just work out for Pam.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.600
But how will that happen?

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:12.600
How will she take advantage of this opportunity of a stable home life letting her study more, if she simply can't afford tuition?

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.600
Unfortunately, we never get a decent conclusion to this plotline.

01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:18.600
In season 8, in the episode Pam Applies to College,

01:15:18.600 --> 01:15:22.600
the idea of Pam not being able to afford to go to school is completely dropped,

01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.600
and instead it becomes a case of her grades not being high enough,

01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.600
with only one semester of solid work after having moved in with the Huxtables.

01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:32.600
Pam, look, it takes more than one semester of work to get into college.

01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.600
But I wanna go.

01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:37.600
You know, all this time you people tell me go to college, go to college.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:40.600
Now I wanna go to college and you people won't let me in.

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.600
But you people would make up your mind.

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.600
And this is more or less how it all gets wrapped up.

01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.600
I suppose Pam starts working jobs to eventually afford college, but that's just a guess.

01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:54.600
We don't get a better look of how things will turn out for her.

01:15:54.600 --> 01:16:00.600
Unfortunately, the Cosby Show doesn't really give us an understanding of what life is like for someone who wants to go to college but can't afford it.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:04.600
Although Pam was meant to give us a look at the world outside the Huxtable home,

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.600
it reveals how timid the show can be to really take a look at it.

01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:11.600
It lets Pam exist in the Huxtable world, but doesn't do much to describe hers,

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:16.600
and if anything, she conforms to that new world more so than bringing a new perspective to it.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:23.600
In the sixth season, it was revealed that Theo's lack of educational achievement was a product not of him having bad study habits,

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.600
but rather having dyslexia.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.600
The night before the test, I knew I was gonna get an A.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:33.600
Yeah, because you told me that you were gonna knock it out of the park.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:35.600
And I got a C.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.600
You guys, I'm sick of being stupid.

01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:39.600
Ms. Roscoe gave me the test results back.

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:40.600
And?

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:42.600
What did she say?

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.600
You guys, I'm dyslexic.

01:16:50.600 --> 01:16:57.600
This episode, Theo's gift, even writes a few wrongs when the Huxtables re-examine their own behaviors when it came to their parenting of Theo.

01:16:57.600 --> 01:17:04.600
And to thank Theo, all those years you were doing lousy in school and dad called you lazy.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.600
I know.

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:09.600
He has been pretty rough on me.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:13.600
I don't think that this is the time for you to bring these things up.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:16.600
Well, I don't blame you, Mom. You must feel just as bad.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.600
Excuse me?

01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:25.600
And with the appropriate techniques, Theo is able to work through his dyslexia and starts improving his academic performance.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:30.600
As Theo's grades improve, he makes the Dean's List and starts setting himself up to go to grad school.

01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:37.600
One of his interests is teaching, so we see him take a job at the local community center in a poorer community running an after-school program.

01:17:37.600 --> 01:17:43.600
It's here where the Cosby Show once again tries to give the audience a broader look at the Black American experience.

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:49.600
We get a chance to meet Theo and his new supporting cast of young teens in Theo and the Kids, Part 1.

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:55.600
Where Theo quickly realizes watching over some kids at an after-school program is going to be tougher than he imagined.

01:17:55.600 --> 01:17:59.600
Rosa! Rosa! Rosa! Rosa!

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.600
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:08.600
Now I want everybody to sit down and shut up.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:18.600
This is the episode where we first meet Stanley, Rudy's eventual love interest, and learn that, like Theo, he may also have dyslexia.

01:18:18.600 --> 01:18:24.600
All my life, I felt like I was walking in the basement, and everybody had to lie to him but me.

01:18:24.600 --> 01:18:30.600
See, I had a little flashlight. I could see a little bit of this, a little bit of that, but I could never see the whole room.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:34.600
Stanley, you're walking through life with a flashlight, and you don't have to.

01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:45.600
While a nice short story of Theo making a difference in one kid's life, what makes this two-parter interesting is Theo's attempt to connect to another student, named Rahim, played by Keenan Scott.

01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:47.600
You want to talk about it, man?

01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:51.600
What's the talk about? They laid off half my father's shift at the paper company.

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:55.600
I'm sorry to hear that, man. I mean, let's just hope it's temporary.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.600
Yeah, I hope so, too. But in the meantime, I'm not going to be coming to the center.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:00.600
Why not?

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:06.600
Because I'm the oldest. I got to make some money, so after school, I'm going to be delivering groceries at the supermarket.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:10.600
After this week, I'm out of here. Peace, Mr. Huxtable.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:22.600
Rahim's family's struggle with Bunny is something Theo can't fix on his own, and sadly, reflective of the problems a lot of Rahim's classmates face.

01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:43.600
Rahim slams the bag down on the floor.

01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:54.600
You know, every day, we get these lunches, these box lunches, with apples, carrots, sandwiches, milk, you know.

01:19:54.600 --> 01:20:03.600
Now, this one girl, every day, she volunteers to go around and collect the garbage, and then she goes out in the hallway.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:07.600
So, of course, I'm thinking she's separating the stuff for recycling.

01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:13.600
Dad, she opened that backpack, and there was all this food.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.600
And she told me that she takes the food home to feed her family.

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.600
Theo simply can't save all his students.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.600
I'll save a seat for you.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:29.600
Actually, I don't want that seat. I want to sit next to that girl, Cal. I think she likes me.

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.600
You got it.

01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.600
This gives us another glimpse into the world outside the Huxtable home and the limitations of its approach.

01:20:39.600 --> 01:20:49.600
It can make a positive difference, sending Theo out in the world to help a kid like Stanley, but for Rahim and many of his fellow students, Theo can't make the impact he wishes he could.

01:20:49.600 --> 01:20:52.600
I appreciate the different challenges of these kids being brought up.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:59.600
We're seeing class struggles and the limited impact of a good teacher, but it doesn't completely disregard the fact that a good teacher does make a difference.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:04.600
Even if it isn't enough to change the world, it can at least provide some comfort and support for these kids.

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:14.600
This two-parter closed Season 7, and we saw more of Theo with these kids in Season 8, but unfortunately, it didn't go a heck of a lot deeper than what we saw in these episodes.

01:21:14.600 --> 01:21:18.600
We do meet Rahim one more time in the Season 8 episode, Cliff and Theo Come Clean.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:28.600
It's never explained how he got back into the after-school program, but his financial problems remain, as seen when he discovers some money and the kids have a debate over what should be done with it.

01:21:28.600 --> 01:21:41.600
The money is eventually returned to its owner, but the episode luckily doesn't end with such a simple lesson.

01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:11.600
But the people who need it most never get it. Other people get it. Like politicians, movie stars, ballplayers, preachers, they're all taking down big bucks.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:12.600
Yeah, you're right.

01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:20.600
But they're not all good people. Some do drugs, some steal it, some even lie all the time just to keep their money.

01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.600
But what does it have to do with Rahim?

01:22:22.600 --> 01:22:27.600
This Rahim? This Rahim should have kept his mouth shut and walked out of here with that money.

01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:32.600
This Rahim is the last on his fool.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:45.600
Theo lets Rahim know he would have done just the same, and so would his classmates, and it might have been enough to impress Letitia, one of Rahim's classmates, which seems to placate him, but does little to address the very real problems he brought up.

01:22:45.600 --> 01:22:54.600
The episode states quite plainly that we shouldn't sacrifice our personal ethics in pursuit of a more just world, and it reflects one of the more depressing messages of the series.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:23:02.600
Take care of yourselves, and eventually things will work. Or maybe they won't. But at least you won't be corrupted. You'll just be hungry.

01:23:02.600 --> 01:23:06.600
One bright part in this subplot was seeing Theo grow as a character.

01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:12.600
In season 8, he was both accepted into grad school and offered a high paying job with a major corporation.

01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:20.600
He relished the chance to have options in his life, though he ultimately decided to pursue grad school so he can keep working with kids like Stanley and Rahim.

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:32.600
And this of course leads us to the series finale, titled, And So We Commence, a two parter about the Hoxtable family getting ready for Theo's graduation. It would air on April 30th, 1992.

01:23:32.600 --> 01:23:38.600
The ending of The Cosby Show was a major event for NBC, with ads circulating widely promoting this finale.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:46.600
You're invited to witness a special chapter in television history, an event people will be talking about for months to come. The final Cosby Show.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:57.600
The episode itself, however, proved to be a bit tepid. Perhaps that made it more fitting for a series that was about small moments and simple plots, but for an ending to an eight year story, it felt a bit flat.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:03.600
The plotline through this two parter was the tension over whether or not Theo would find enough tickets for his expansive family.

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:13.600
Eventually he does. And that pretty much sums up the finale's plot. There are some cute moments, such as a role reversal between Theo and Cliff.

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:40.600
And Cliff's reaction to the surprise return of Dabness is fun.

01:24:40.600 --> 01:24:42.600
Hi, Daddy.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:49.600
Dabness. Dabness. Dabness. Dabness. Dabness.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:50.600
How are you, sir?

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:52.600
Hi, Dad.

01:24:52.600 --> 01:24:54.600
Dabness.

01:24:54.600 --> 01:25:05.600
Denise also makes an appearance, although Lisa Bonet certainly does not. Instead, we see a brief scene where everyone talks to Denise over the phone and we find out that she's pregnant.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.600
What?

01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.600
My baby.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.600
What?

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:13.600
My baby's having a baby.

01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:22.600
The plot for this two parter is so thin, we get a flashback to the first episode for six whole minutes.

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:28.600
As the series ends, Cliff and Claire dance together to celebrate another child successfully on their way.

01:25:28.600 --> 01:25:34.600
The final line you can scarcely hear comes from Cliff, or maybe it's Bill at this point, saying,

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:41.600
Come on, let's go, as the two continue to make personal comments, fading into obscurity as they move towards the audience.

01:25:41.600 --> 01:25:46.600
And with that, the Huxtables danced off into the sunset.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:50.600
The final episode was more a celebration of the series rather than an ending.

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:54.600
It's clear that the Huxtables' lives will go on, whether there's a camera to capture them or not.

01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.600
We just got a few years to watch the escapades.

01:25:56.600 --> 01:26:02.600
The finale offers a small chance to reflect on the themes of the series, the value of good parenting, a proper education,

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:05.600
and the need for the financial means to make that happen.

01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:10.600
Theo embodies the success of this philosophy, to make a better world in his immediate surroundings,

01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:13.600
though perhaps not changing the wider world outside of that.

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:16.600
In many ways, it's a good metaphor for the Cosby Show itself.

01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:22.600
It wasn't a series that tried to change television by rewriting the rules, so much as it tried to make itself a positive example.

01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:30.600
And its example led to a new age of family-friendly sitcoms, one that felt safe and comfortable but didn't necessarily rock the boat.

01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:44.600
The finale of the Cosby Show aired on April 30, 1992, which was the second day of what are commonly called the 1992 Los Angeles riots,

01:26:44.600 --> 01:26:48.600
though some might prefer the name of the 1992 Los Angeles uprising.

01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:57.600
These were precipitated by the brutal arrest and beating of Rodney King, in which four police officers beat King, unaware that they were being filmed at the time.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:00.600
The footage sparked outrage, and the four officers were charged.

01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:06.600
On April 29, they were acquitted of those charges, sparking unrest in the city.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:16.600
Though live news coverage dominated the evening in Los Angeles, it was suspended for an hour to air the final episode of the Cosby Show, a decision made by the local NBC affiliate.

01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:22.600
Today, Mayor Tom Bradley urged everyone in Los Angeles to remain home, to stay off the streets.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:32.600
He also suggested they might want to watch the Cosby Show because he believes, and we believe, we need this time, a bit of a cooling off period, giving us some breathing space.

01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:38.600
Maybe a time to remember what Thursday nights were like before all this madness began in Los Angeles.

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:42.600
The Rodney King video revealed a truth known in black communities for decades.

01:27:42.600 --> 01:27:48.600
The police would often, with impunity, brutalize black men during arrest, something that still happens today.

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:57.600
There's something fitting about the Cosby Show, which was often accused of obscuring racism of the day, having its finale being used for the exact same purpose.

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:01.600
Cosby's own feelings about the situation were made clear in an interview.

01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:12.600
It is very difficult to look at the King tape and feel that this is not excessive force, and obviously the people were waiting for some kind of reprimand, and when they got and saw nothing at all, the response came.

01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:18.600
Now, how do you say these people are irresponsible without first committing responsibility to a verdict?

01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:20.600
I don't understand.

01:28:20.600 --> 01:28:25.600
However, when asked about the decision to air the episode in Los Angeles, Cosby said in an interview,

01:28:42.600 --> 01:28:45.600
that for eight years had given people a good feeling about themselves.

01:28:45.600 --> 01:28:57.600
It seems clear by these words that Bill Cosby never meant for his show to directly address the realities of discrimination black Americans faced in the modern day, at least not at a level of detail that could possibly hope to address something like police brutality.

01:28:57.600 --> 01:29:02.600
The Cosby Show rarely mentioned race at all, and what it did often didn't include the central cast.

01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:04.600
Here's a rare example from the series.

01:29:12.600 --> 01:29:27.600
And none of the principal cast is even present in this scene.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:31.600
It's a moment that happens, and just as easily moved on from.

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:35.600
The show just wasn't terribly interested in tackling the topic of racial discrimination.

01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:40.600
It raises the question of what this show meant to the audience it was designed to uplift.

01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:43.600
What were the reactions to the Cosby Show from black audiences?

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:47.600
One prominent criticism was an editorial published in the New York Times titled,

01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:53.600
TV's Black World Turns But Stays Unreal, by literary scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:30:03.600
While I applaud Cosby's success at depicting, at long last, the everyday concerns of black people, love, sex, ambition, generational conflicts, work and leisure,

01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:11.600
far beyond reflex responses to white racism, the question remains, has TV managed to depict a truly different world?

01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:15.600
Gates's writing reflects what many black critics of the show had observed,

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:18.600
and Cosby himself addressed some of those concerns in interviews.

01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.600
In one 1989 interview he said,

01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:25.600
I agree with critics who say it doesn't do enough, but the people who are viewing it are having a ball with it.

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:29.600
We get thank you letters from all over the US, Canada and Europe.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:31.600
I know I've got to go a distance with it.

01:30:31.600 --> 01:30:37.600
And in another interview expressed concern that if he highlighted racial conflict, it would make white viewers feel like they were the villain.

01:30:37.600 --> 01:30:42.600
In 1995, Leslie B. Innes and Joe R. Fiegen published an article titled,

01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:47.600
The Cosby Show, The View from the Black Middle Class, in the Journal of Black Studies.

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:52.600
The authors had over 100 members of the Black Middle Class describe their opinions on representations in media,

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.600
and the article highlighted the many thoughts related to The Cosby Show.

01:30:55.600 --> 01:30:58.600
Here are a few examples of the responses they got.

01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.600
I do know that this is just entertainment, but my kids think it's the way we should live.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:04.600
That is unfair.

01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:12.600
It is unfair for me to explain to my son that, no, mom is not a lawyer, dad is not a doctor, and these things don't work that way.

01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:14.600
I think it's really sad.

01:31:14.600 --> 01:31:20.600
I wish we had more shows like Cosby on TV, where you have a black doctor and the wife is a lawyer, because they do exist.

01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:26.600
I mean, they're on a small scale, percentage-wise, but they do exist, and I think we take too many negatives and blow them up.

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:33.600
I have a problem with the fact that The Cosby Show will build a 30-minute episode around Heathcliff Huxtable building a hero sandwich.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:36.600
Why aren't we dealing with some real issues that are confronting the Black Middle Class?

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:43.600
Yes, the kids go to NYU and other great universities like that, but what they come home talking about is what this racist professor said and did,

01:31:43.600 --> 01:31:46.600
and I don't see that occurring on The Cosby Show.

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:51.600
As you can see by some of the responses highlighted, there is no overarching positive or negative trend in the comments.

01:31:51.600 --> 01:31:56.600
The authors of the article observed that the overwhelming theme in the responses were how mixed they all were,

01:31:56.600 --> 01:31:59.600
often reflecting on both positive and negative aspects of the program.

01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:06.600
Considering these comments are about the most popular show in the country, it undermines the sort of enthusiasm you might expect for such a big hit.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:14.600
It reveals to us that the show perhaps struck a stronger chord, not with the Black audiences it hoped to inspire, but the white audiences who found comfort in it.

01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:22.600
The Cosby Show would be re-examined many times over the years, as more sitcoms starring Black families deviated from its squeaky-clean aesthetic.

01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:30.600
But it was comments from a particular speech of Bill Cosby's that would once again offer the chance to reframe the show and the work Cosby had done throughout his career.

01:32:31.600 --> 01:32:33.600
Get in somebody else's business.

01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:40.600
On May 17, 2004, during an NAACP Legal Defense Fund award ceremony in Washington, D.C.,

01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:45.600
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision,

01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:50.600
Bill Cosby gave a speech where he made some very pointed remarks about the Black community.

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:54.600
These are people going around stealing Coca-Cola.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:59.600
People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake.

01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:03.600
And then we all run out and wear outrage.

01:33:03.600 --> 01:33:05.600
Oh, the cops shouldn't have shot him.

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:08.600
How was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:16.600
Everybody knows it's important to speak English, except these knuckleheads.

01:33:16.600 --> 01:33:21.600
You can't land a plane with why you ain't where or how to hunt it.

01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:26.600
You can't be a doctor with that kind of crap coming out of your mouth.

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:29.600
The speech had a number of factual errors,

01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:32.600
and I've included an article that rebuts many of its points below.

01:33:32.600 --> 01:33:36.600
Perhaps the most famous response to the speech came from Michael Eric Dyson,

01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:41.600
who wrote, is Bill Cosby right, or has the Black middle class lost his mind?

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:45.600
In an interview with NPR, Dyson gave a rundown of his critique of Cosby's speech.

01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:49.600
The interview was preceded by remarks from Bill Cosby that clarified his infamous speech.

01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:53.600
I'm looking at, in the lower economic area,

01:33:53.600 --> 01:33:59.600
the 50 percent dropout of the African American male from high school.

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:02.600
And I'm realizing that there's a great deal of racism.

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.600
We take that. We all know that.

01:34:05.600 --> 01:34:11.600
But then again, there's a time when we have to turn around the mirror and look at ourselves.

01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:15.600
And in that NPR program, we get to hear Dyson's response to that.

01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:20.600
The best of our Black leaders and intellectuals who have always remembered it's a both and,

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:23.600
even as you speak about personal responsibility,

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:27.600
you link that personal responsibility to its possibility of realization

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:35.600
in a culture that either enables you to do better or puts its foot on your neck and keeps you from rising.

01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:39.600
And what's more, he explains the harm done by Bill Cosby by making these debates

01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:42.600
happening within Black communities available to the broader public.

01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:46.600
They get in on a conversation that's been going on for a long time among Black folk

01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:48.600
who are speaking shorthand and they don't quite get it.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:52.600
So now public policymakers who hear Mr. Cosby assaulting the poor

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:55.600
and saying that they are responsible begin to change their mind.

01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:00.600
They say, well, we thought we had to help them because we had to indict our own social practices

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.600
for their failure to be able to assist these people.

01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.600
Now, as Mr. Cosby is saying, they got to do it themselves.

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.600
So maybe we shouldn't put this extra money into this program.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.600
Much of what Cosby had said in his speech could be seen in his work over the decades,

01:35:12.600 --> 01:35:13.600
including the Cosby show.

01:35:14.600 --> 01:35:18.600
In the season eight episode, For Men Only, we see what Cliff Huxtable's advice

01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:20.600
to teen boys at a community center look like.

01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:50.600
The message is, quite clearly, the only thing stopping these guys from making a future for themselves

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.600
is the decisions they make.

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:54.600
It's very conservative messaging.

01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:57.600
You could almost imagine Huxtable handing out bootstraps.

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:00.600
And while it's not a bad message, personal responsibility is a good thing.

01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:05.600
It doesn't address the additional challenges these guys will face trying to escape a life of poverty.

01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:09.600
Cliff recommends a higher education, but how do they afford it?

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:11.600
And what burden will this place on their family?

01:36:11.600 --> 01:36:14.600
And it's a bit galling to hear this from Cliff Huxtable,

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:18.600
because how many of his kids had to work an additional job to afford their tuition?

01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.600
Even with the momentary backlash against the poundcake speech,

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.600
Bill Cosby's reputation was still healthy enough that,

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:27.600
by the time the 30th anniversary of the Cosby show rolled around in the fall of 2014,

01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:32.600
there was a round of positive media coverage examining its longevity and success.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:38.600
In some cases, articles hypothesize that the success of the Cosby show helped prepare America for its first black president.

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.600
Though Bill Cosby was still widely credited with being America's dad,

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:44.600
that image would be changed in late 2014,

01:36:44.600 --> 01:36:48.600
when a story he likely thought buried once again returned to the surface.

01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:53.600
The following section includes sexual assault.

01:36:53.600 --> 01:36:57.600
If you would like to skip ahead, go to the timestamp below.

01:36:57.600 --> 01:37:03.600
In 2004, Andrea Konstan, director of operations for the women's basketball team at Temple University,

01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.600
claimed that Bill Cosby had given her pills that made her semi-unconscious and unable to move.

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:12.600
And while she was in that state, she alleged that Cosby sexually assaulted her.

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:16.600
In January of 2005, Konstan filed a criminal complaint.

01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:19.600
Cosby claimed that the counter was consensual.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:21.600
The case was eventually dropped by the prosecutor,

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:24.600
seeing it as a case of he said, she said.

01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:28.600
But Konstan then filed a civil claim against Cosby in March of 2005,

01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.600
alongside 13 women who offered to be witnesses,

01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:34.600
making similar claims about Cosby's predatory behavior.

01:37:34.600 --> 01:37:39.600
The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum in November of 2006.

01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:43.600
In June of 2006, Philadelphia Magazine published an article by Robert Huber titled,

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:45.600
Dr. Huxtable and Mr. Hyde,

01:37:45.600 --> 01:37:50.600
that began to pull back on the carefully crafted public persona that Cosby had made for himself.

01:37:50.600 --> 01:37:55.600
Interspersed with this article are the stories of some of the women Cosby had assaulted,

01:37:55.600 --> 01:37:57.600
revealing damning details.

01:37:57.600 --> 01:38:02.600
The story of Cosby being a sexual predator did not capture public attention,

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:05.600
or at least it would not for another eight years,

01:38:05.600 --> 01:38:09.600
when a clip from a stand-up performance by Hannibal Perez went viral in late 2014.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:12.600
Suddenly, the media was all over the story,

01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:16.600
and even more women started coming forward with similar accounts as to what happened to Konstan

01:38:16.600 --> 01:38:18.600
and the other women who came forward.

01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.600
In total, over 60 women came forward with accusations against Cosby,

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:25.600
ranging from sexual harassment to rape.

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:27.600
With mounting public pressure,

01:38:27.600 --> 01:38:33.600
the lawyer for Konstan requested that the deposition made by Cosby in the 2005 case be unsealed.

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:37.600
The judge agreed, citing Cosby's role as a public moralist.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:43.600
When the deposition was unsealed, it revealed that Cosby had admitted to giving women quaaludes before having sex with them.

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:49.600
According to Cosby, these encounters were consensual, though many of his 60-plus accusers dispute that.

01:38:49.600 --> 01:38:53.600
The statute of limitations had expired on many of the claims his accusers had made,

01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:55.600
so they couldn't be tested in court.

01:38:55.600 --> 01:38:59.600
Only Konstan's accusations still existed within the statute of limitations,

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.600
and would eventually go to criminal court.

01:39:02.600 --> 01:39:07.600
In December of 2015, Cosby was charged with three instances of aggravated indecent assault,

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:11.600
and in April of 2018, he would be found guilty on all three charges.

01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:14.600
He was sentenced to three to ten years in state prison.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:18.600
Cosby's castmates from the series have largely remained quiet about the situation,

01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:21.600
though I did appreciate this comment from Joseph C. Phillips.

01:39:22.600 --> 01:39:26.600
I think like a lot of people, I was really giving Bill the benefit of the doubt.

01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.600
This was not the man that I knew. This is not the man that I worked with.

01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:36.600
He may have had other faults, but he certainly was not drugging people and raping them.

01:39:36.600 --> 01:39:39.600
And then I had a conversation with an old friend.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:42.600
Bumped into her. I hadn't talked to her in a couple of years.

01:39:44.600 --> 01:39:48.600
I just thought, hey, he used to be like your mentor or something.

01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:49.600
Was she an actress?

01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:52.600
Yeah, and I don't want to say too much about it.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:53.600
So he was a mentor to her?

01:39:53.600 --> 01:40:03.600
Yes, and for two hours, she sat in my car, crying, telling me her story, all of the details.

01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:06.600
And at that moment, something changed for me.

01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:11.600
She turned to me and she said, she wiped her face, and she said, do you believe me?

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.600
And I said, yes, I believe you.

01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:22.600
And that was the change. And I had to look with sober eyes at what was going on.

01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.600
This turn of events dramatically shifted public perception of Bill Cosby and, by extension, his body of work.

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:33.600
One immediate effect was the season seven episode, Last Barbecue, being pulled from syndication.

01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:39.600
In it, Cliff brewed up special barbecue sauce that could put whoever tasted it into a sexual mood.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:43.600
Haven't you ever noticed after people have some of my barbecue sauce?

01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:46.600
After a while, when it kicks in, they get all huggy buggy.

01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:53.600
Another challenge to experiencing the series was the knowledge that some of the actresses who appeared on the show were preyed upon by Cosby.

01:40:53.600 --> 01:40:57.600
It introduces a complication when it comes to looking back at certain episodes,

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:04.600
how they can possibly be enjoyed when we know the actress we're seeing on screen has been victimized by the actor sitting next to them.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:06.600
This isn't a new phenomena, of course.

01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:14.600
Once you do know the truth, it's very hard, at least for me, to not see the real life stories in front of whatever narrative is unfolding on the screen.

01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:20.600
A number of articles were produced reflecting on how our new public image of Bill Cosby impacted the Cosby Show.

01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.600
For Salon, Chauncey DeVega wrote,

01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.600
As a child of the hip-hop generation and a member of the black working class, I grew up loving the Cosby Show.

01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:35.600
Nevertheless, I have no shame in admitting that I have much more in common with the white folks on Roseanne or the black family on rock than I ever could with the Huxtables.

01:41:35.600 --> 01:41:40.600
And in the Chicago Tribune, reflected on the Cosby guilty verdict, Dileen Glanton wrote,

01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:08.600
Our mistake was in trying to make Cliff and Cosby one and the same.

01:42:08.600 --> 01:42:17.600
The most striking image of the shifting perspective of the Cosby Show came from the 2015 cover of Ebony magazine showing a shattered portrait, the fractures coming from Cosby himself.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:24.600
The editor-in-chief of Ebony at the time, Kieran Omayo, wrote in 2018 on Cosby's guilty verdict as well.

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:30.600
Cliff Huxtable's existence wasn't as much about truth, damn right, as it was about archetypal representation.

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:36.600
Perhaps not enough of us in black America had seen or remembered this figure before the Cosby Show and Lord knows.

01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:40.600
Until then, white America was virtually certain he never existed.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:47.600
I know that beautiful black men like my father who do not abuse exist across generations and have through every era of American life.

01:42:47.600 --> 01:42:55.600
Therefore, I refuse to have my passion and pride for the creative genius and iconography of the Cosby Show allow me to be the slightest bit confused.

01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:08.600
I don't have to ride for the fallen decrepit Bill Cosby to prove what I know about black excellence, black decency, black humor, black art, black colleges, black family, black mothers, or black male heroes.

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:16.600
Although Bill Cosby will likely forever be viewed as a predator first, the fiction of the Bill Cosby Show may still have a lasting legacy outside of that.

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:28.600
Many works of art have been created by artists who have said and done reprehensible things, and we all have to decide for ourselves where we draw the line on what it means to enjoy a work of art, knowing those facts.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:34.600
Reading what Mayo got from the Cosby Show reflect the power of a person's experience with a work of art.

01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:40.600
The death of the author, written by Roland Barthes, is often cited when describing how to separate art from the artist.

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:57.600
In the case of Bill Cosby, his failings of a person have created a metaphorical public death of sorts, and because of that, those who wish to hold on to his creative works, such as the Cosby Show, are taking that final step of removing him entirely from the equation and creating an appreciation of the Cosby Show that is truly their own.

01:43:57.600 --> 01:44:11.600
Before the Cosby Show, Felicia Rashad had primarily worked on stage, and at the end of the series, she would once again return to that space.

01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:18.600
She had a number of roles on screen as well, perhaps most notably starring alongside Bill Cosby in the 1996 series, Cosby.

01:44:18.600 --> 01:44:26.600
In 2004, she won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for A Raisin in the Sun, making her the first black actress to ever win that award.

01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:32.600
Following the end of the Cosby Show, Lisa Bonet went on to appear in a number of different films, such as High Fidelity and Enemy of the State.

01:44:32.600 --> 01:44:41.600
She's also had a handful of roles on television, though she seems to have devoted much of her time to raising her three children, and in 2017, she married fellow performer Jason Momoa.

01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:47.600
Malcolm Jamal Warner branched out in directing, having directed several episodes of the Cosby Show in its later seasons.

01:44:47.600 --> 01:44:54.600
He still managed to continue acting as well, appearing in numerous TV shows and movies, notably starring in his own sitcom, Malcolm and Eddie.

01:44:54.600 --> 01:45:04.600
He even released a few albums, and in 2015 won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance, along with Robert Glasper and Lala Hathaway for Jesus Children.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:08.600
Tempest Bledsoe hosted a talk show briefly, titled The Tempest Bledsoe Show.

01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.600
She's also performed in a number of different productions.

01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:17.600
Since 1993, she has been in a relationship with Daryl M. Bell, who starred on A Different World.

01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:25.600
Keisha Knight Pulliam made history in 1986, being the youngest person nominated for an Emmy at the age of six for her work on the Cosby Show.

01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:34.600
Following the show's end, she continued acting, having found success in a number of roles, most notably as Miranda Lucas Payne on Tyler Perry's House of Pain.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:41.600
Sabrina LaBeouf finds herself performing as the lead at a number of productions with the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, DC.

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:46.600
Jeffrey Owens had a handful of roles following the Cosby Show, though none that had quite the same prominence.

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:55.600
In 2018, photos of Owens surfaced, showing him working at Trader Joe's, bagging groceries, which unfortunately drew a lot of negative attention, forcing him to quit.

01:45:55.600 --> 01:46:02.600
Tyler Perry offered Owens a role in the Haves and Have Nots for ten episodes, which seems to have led to a revival of his acting career.

01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:08.600
Joseph C. Phillips has been acting extensively since the ending of the series, notably as Justice Ward on General Hospital.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.600
He also works as a conservative commentator.

01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:17.600
Raven Simone went from the Cosby Show directly to another sitcom, hanging with Mr. Cooper, which ran for four years.

01:46:17.600 --> 01:46:23.600
She was the lead in That's So Raven on the Disney Channel, during which she was nominated for a number of awards.

01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:26.600
Following that series, she's gone on to appear in countless TV shows and movies.

01:46:26.600 --> 01:46:30.600
She's also had a prolific singing career, releasing four studio albums.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:37.600
Erika Alexander immediately moved on to a second series, Living Single, where she played the role Maxine Shaw for five seasons.

01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:42.600
She has been working consistently ever since, with roles in a number of movies and TV shows.

01:46:42.600 --> 01:46:47.600
Some notable recent roles for her were in the film Get Out and the CW series Black Lightning.

01:46:47.600 --> 01:46:54.600
On June 30, 2021, Bill Cosby's conviction was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

01:46:54.600 --> 01:47:05.600
They found that the testimony from the 2005 civil case used by the prosecution in the 2015 criminal case had included an agreement by the previous prosecutor that Cosby would not be criminally charged.

01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:16.600
District Attorney Kevin Steele, who had prosecuted Cosby in 2015, said that Cosby was found guilty by a jury and now goes free on a procedural issue that is irrelevant to the facts of the crime.

01:47:16.600 --> 01:47:23.600
Steele also expressed hope that this result will not deter future victims of sexual assault from coming forward.

01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:28.600
To talk about the Cosby Show, I think it's important to understand the context around it.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:33.600
In a sense, it may be completely unfair to put so much into understanding a single sitcom.

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:41.600
Other sitcoms, particularly ones with white casts, aren't expected to redefine racial politics or spark radical discourse on social justice.

01:47:41.600 --> 01:47:46.600
But one successful show story in a black cast suddenly has that burden placed upon it.

01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:49.600
But contrary to that, the Cosby Show wasn't just another sitcom.

01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:59.600
It was one of the most popular sitcoms of all time, and I think it's important to ask how it got there by looking at what it did and what it didn't, and then when it got there, what it did with its new prominence.

01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:10.600
I think an important lesson we can take away from the Cosby Show is that representation in media has a profound impact, and what a piece of media does with that representation matters as well.

01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:17.600
Although being seen and visible has value, what is done with that visibility can take a good show and make it truly great.

01:48:20.600 --> 01:48:25.600
This video was very tough to make.

01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:29.600
Watching the eight seasons of the Cosby Show wasn't even the toughest part.

01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:41.600
Collecting the research and reading all the different opinions and analyses of the show really broadened my perspective and made me appreciate a show in a way that perhaps I wouldn't have seen simply watching it on my own.

01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:53.600
A lot of hard work went into making this video, so if you would like to see more of these in the future, please consider becoming a patron or a member for this channel, like these fine names coming up the screen now.

01:48:53.600 --> 01:49:02.600
It's because of these people that I was able to hang on for just a little bit longer, making sure this video was as good as it can be, and I hope that came across.

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:08.600
In addition to supporting this channel, you'll also get early access to videos and a chance to download my theme songs.
