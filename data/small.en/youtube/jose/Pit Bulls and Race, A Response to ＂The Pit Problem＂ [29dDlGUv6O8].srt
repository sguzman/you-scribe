1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,840
What do you think of when someone mentions a pitbull?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,280
Do vaguely suspicious images like these come into your mind?

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:13,680
If you're like me, and most other people, someone put those images in there.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,240
In recent weeks, certain folks on Twitter have been pushing an anti-pitbull narrative

5
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,680
that's filled with half-truths, bad research, and lots of other fear-mongering.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,080
If you've been following the news about pitbulls over the last few decades, you might

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,240
think they've co-opted a legitimate controversy around the pitbull.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,840
But the stigma attached to pitbulls go deeper than that.

9
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:40,520
This new wave of anti-pitbull rhetoric is tired garbage, cosmetically altered with minimal

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,760
effort.

11
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,120
Which brings me to this video by Brittany Venti, The Pit Problem.

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,160
While going through this video, I'll spare you any and all images of animals or children

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:52,600
being mauled.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,240
If you're interested in checking out Venti's video, be warned, it has a lot of that in

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,320
there and it literally just goes right into it, no warning.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,480
So here's that warning for you.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,060
Like all great thought leaders, Brittany Venti was motivated to make this video after she

18
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,240
saw a sign on a truck and some memes posted on the internet.

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,520
I never really thought about doing a video until now, and I think now is the perfect

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,040
time to do so.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,040
There's trucks driving around New York with LCD screens saying to ban pitbulls, and Petco

22
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,920
just banned pitbulls from playing with other pets at their stores.

23
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,920
And I've seen a lot of anti-pitbull memes in the past few months.

24
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,800
Pitbulls, like she sort of mentions in her video, were bred from bulldogs.

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:49,180
Bulldogs were originally bred in England for the hideous sport of bullbaiting.

26
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:54,100
This involved tying a bull, or sometimes a bear, to a post and having several dogs

27
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,820
maul it to death, or die in the attempt.

28
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,700
The sport was banned in 1835.

29
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:06,060
With bullbaiting banned, these dogs were sadly conscripted into another blood sport, that

30
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,260
of dogfighting.

31
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,340
The breeding pressure now shifted over to producing dogs that would be aggressive towards

32
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
other dogs.

33
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,540
So, the pitbull was born.

34
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:19,140
A little known fact is that the majority of dog breeds were created in the 19th century,

35
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,180
and often represented the interests or desire of the upper classes of a given society.

36
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,740
Particularly wealthy individuals would breed dogs, because they could easily afford it,

37
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:33,820
to generate specific characteristics or traits, or even just physical appearances that they

38
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,660
liked.

39
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:40,300
Once a dog no longer had any purpose to the upper class, or just was no longer popular,

40
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:44,840
it would often be discarded and fall in with the less discriminating lower classes.

41
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,420
This is what happened to the pitbull.

42
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:51,620
Although the pitbull was still used for dogfighting, the vast majority of pitbulls tended to be

43
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,420
family pets and were no longer being bred for blood sports.

44
00:02:55,420 --> 00:03:00,140
Its formerly purebred genes have had well over a century of mixing to dilute the breeding

45
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,700
done to it in the 19th century.

46
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,740
It's also important to know that when people refer to pitbulls, that term includes at least

47
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:08,380
four distinct breeds and several mixes.

48
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:13,420
Also, boxers, aquitas, and sharpes were all historically bred for fighting too, but they

49
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,620
don't get portrayed as dangerous the way pitbulls are.

50
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,740
So when people like Brittany Venti talk about their breeding history to paint pitbulls as

51
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,740
inherently dangerous, it's fear mongering, plain and simple.

52
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,780
And the pitbull's story doesn't end in the 19th century, but let's return to the video

53
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:36,620
before talking about the pitbull in 20th century America.

54
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,980
Venti tries to explain dog breeding by saying,

55
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:43,900
It's just a natural instinct that has been selectively bred by breeders.

56
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,900
Dogs are going to do what they were bred to do.

57
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,900
Some dogs are meant for herding, some dogs are meant for hunting, and then some dogs

58
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,900
are meant for herding.

59
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,660
What I think she's trying to get across here, the English language be damned, is that she

60
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:00,620
is a big believer in genetics driving behaviour, and that a dog bred for a purpose is tied

61
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,180
to that purpose, as its genes will only allow for that limited range of behaviour selected

62
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,060
by a breeder.

63
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,020
While traits can definitely be passed on to other dogs through breeding, without that

64
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,940
continued selection pressure, traits can often fall out of favour.

65
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:20,180
Evolution doesn't stamp a finished label on any species, and some breeders have found

66
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:24,620
pitbulls can lose their aggression within two to three generations, a milestone that the

67
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,300
vast majority of pitbulls have lived past as.

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,460
And this may come as a surprise to Brittany, very few pitbulls are bred to be fighting dogs.

69
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:35,980
But Brittany Venti isn't interested in that, and this video isn't about representing

70
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,180
science, it's about getting you to believe that genes are what dictate behaviour.

71
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,700
Pitbulls are the most dangerous dog, I'm referring to not only pitbulls, but their

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,820
variations and any mixtures of them.

73
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,140
The mixtures are even more dangerous because sometimes you won't even know it's a pitbull.

74
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,820
Okay, let's think this through.

75
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:01,660
If pitbull genes make a dog violent, why would mixing those genes make a dog less violent?

76
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:06,340
It's almost as if she's saying pitbulls will taint any other breed they're allowed to mix

77
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,640
with.

78
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,400
I wonder what that would sound like if she were talking about human beings for a moment.

79
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:15,360
But right now I'm just reading subtext, Venti clearly said the danger was because people

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,840
wouldn't know the dog is half pitbull, it's almost as if she's saying the onus is on people

81
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,720
and how they treat dogs, but hey hey, I'm just picking on her poor presentation skills

82
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,720
now.

83
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:29,000
There are actual bits of research that are shown throughout this video, all found on

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,440
that noted academic journal, Twitter.

85
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,320
The highlighted captions all come from Twitter user wildgoose999, some Twitter person who

86
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,840
hides behind a bird avatar.

87
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,640
What kind of jerk does that, right?

88
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,400
Let's drill down on a few of the specific claims made by this guy.

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,440
To keep this video reasonable in its length, I'm going to pass over some of the irrelevant

90
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,120
ones, such as groups trying to change the name of pitbulls, thinly sourced claims about

91
00:05:54,120 --> 00:06:00,160
pitbull advocates being cigarette shills, or that pro-pitbull groups are secret satanists.

92
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,080
Because none of those have anything to do with the supposed threat of pitbulls, and

93
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,040
I don't want to waste time on them in the video, although the satanism one was hilariously

94
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,040
not true.

95
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,380
First, there's this little graph that points out that Michael Vick's conviction is some

96
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,880
kind of catalyst for pitbull attacks.

97
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,700
For those who may not remember, Michael Vick is a former pro-football player who operated

98
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,400
a dog fighting ring that killed a number of pitbulls.

99
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:29,240
What the graph is suggesting is that pro-pitbull sentiment that came as a reaction to the story

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:35,200
has made the public friendlier to pitbulls, and therefore more vulnerable to attacks.

101
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,120
The numbers on this graph are compiled from this dataset.

102
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,920
Now, the big problem with this dataset is that it is made up entirely from media reports.

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:49,160
It's not an actual measure of dog bites across the US, but rather the ones reported by the

104
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,160
media.

105
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,800
The growth in anti-pitbull sentiment was heavily fueled by media coverage in the 1980s about

106
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,680
pitbulls being out of control, and this has more or less been an old standard for local

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,760
news reports across the US.

108
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:11,120
The dataset also suggests dog bites are exploding, going from 731 in 2002 to 2975 in 2013.

109
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:15,040
What if we compare this to a neutral data source for a better measure, though?

110
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:24,360
According to the CDC, using data from hospitals across the United States, in 2001, 368,245

111
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,080
people were admitted to a hospital for dog bites.

112
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:32,560
So if we assume the total number of dog bites stayed the same in 2002, or let's even round

113
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:39,120
it down to 360,000, the total number of bites reported in the media represent 0.2% of all

114
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
dog bites.

115
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,040
I should also point out that this bit of research wasn't peer-reviewed or published anywhere,

116
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:50,200
but on the website animals247.org, created by the paper's author Merritt Clifton, a

117
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
long-time anti-pitbull advocate.

118
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,880
He has no serious academic history or credentials, and his research has largely been popularized

119
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,920
by the very slick-looking dogsbite.org sitting along blog posts like this one.

120
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:08,480
And that's not exactly what I would call a constructive criticism of the scientific

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
literature.

122
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:13,400
There's a great blog post that drills into the numbers of Clifton's pitbull attack stats

123
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:18,320
and how they often count ridiculous stories such as a horse kicking a woman after it was

124
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:22,440
startled by a pitbull or an animal control officer slipping and falling while chasing

125
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,640
a dog as pitbull attacks.

126
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:29,920
Give it a read if you want to hear some of the more ridiculous claims.

127
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:34,640
These slides throw out some damning numbers, but here are two things to keep in mind.

128
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:39,520
These all relate to specific communities and not national averages, and they compare singular

129
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,320
breeds with a number of different pitbull breeds blended into a single stat.

130
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,960
The last of the tweets Brittany Venti cites for her video is a thread where Wildgoose999

131
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,940
discusses how it's the genetics of the pitbull that create aggressive behavior and that owners

132
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,580
have nothing to do with it.

133
00:08:54,580 --> 00:09:00,280
The first slide is from Dogbites and Urban Children, published in Pediatrics in 1991.

134
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,660
The first limitation of this paper is that it looks at dogbites reported in a single

135
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,760
Philadelphia hospital in 1989, so again, you can't always generalize one community to

136
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,040
an entire country.

137
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,840
The next problem we run into is the actual data in the research.

138
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,640
This table here breaks down the number of bites by breed, and we can see that pitbulls

139
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,400
actually weren't the most common.

140
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,200
It was the German Shepherd.

141
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,440
The paper's discussion section where the excerpt is taken from does go into detail

142
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,400
about pitbulls, but the two paragraphs shown by Wildgoose999 are less connected than he

143
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,640
might have you think.

144
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,400
The second paragraph isn't really about pitbulls specifically, but dogs in general.

145
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,960
The idea that genetic differences influence behavior is a controversial one, but a tie

146
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,520
that influenced to breed is the shell game that's being played here.

147
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,840
Why is the only term highlighted?

148
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,720
Genetic predisposition.

149
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,160
The other factors of early socialization to people, training or maltreatment, quality

150
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,520
of care and supervision, and behavior of the victim are also factors.

151
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:02,840
Wildgoose999 is arguing that a pitbull's behavior isn't relevant to the actions of its owner,

152
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:07,240
but the non-highlighted variables would be influenced by a dog's upbringing and environment.

153
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:12,440
The paper is clear that the other variables are at least as important, so why emphasize

154
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:14,240
genes?

155
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Possibly because Wildgoose999 has an agenda here, and he's willing to twist the research

156
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
to get that across.

157
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,680
Let's move on to the next one.

158
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:29,440
Mortality, mauling, and maiming by vicious dogs, published in 2011 in Annals of Surgery.

159
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:35,640
Now the quote Wildgoose999 uses is actually not from the paper he's citing.

160
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,520
The Annals of Surgery paper is actually quoting someone from a different paper here, so let's

161
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,160
go to that one.

162
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:50,720
Dog attacks, deaths, and maimings, U.S. and Canada, September 1982 to December 31st, 2013

163
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,720
by...

164
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,960
Oh, it's our old friend Merritt Clifton.

165
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,440
In fact, this paper is the same dataset I debunked earlier.

166
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:05,120
And if you look through the Annals of Surgery paper, it actually cites all kinds of research

167
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:11,080
from dogbites.org and other bits of spurious research from Clifton that hasn't been peer

168
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
reviewed.

169
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:17,160
It even includes a YouTube video as one of its sources, so technically I guess my video

170
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,900
here has just as much academic weight.

171
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:23,920
This makes me question how careful these researchers were in putting together this paper, but I'll

172
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,280
be as charitable as possible here and say, perhaps they're seeing something in Clifton's

173
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,160
work that I'm not.

174
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,720
Their paper closes with this passage.

175
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,120
These breeds should be regulated in the same way in which other dangerous species such

176
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,360
as leopards are regulated.

177
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,440
I'm not sure pit bulls should be considered as dangerous as leopards, but they're the

178
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,920
scientists I guess.

179
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:51,960
Slides 3 through 8 all come from a paper titled, Are Pit Bulls Different?, an analysis

180
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:58,720
of the Pit Bull Terrier controversy published in 1987 in Anthrozoos, a multidisciplinary

181
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:02,960
journal of the interactions of people and animals.

182
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:09,040
All these points come from the same section of the paper, but even in these selected sections,

183
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,240
Wild Goose 999's intentions are betrayed.

184
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,840
The first slide reads, A long history of breeding for bullbaiting and fighting has had a profound

185
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:20,440
effect on the genetic predisposition of many of the fighting breeds.

186
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,320
In many cases, a shorter history of selection for qualities that might make these animals

187
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,400
suitable as household companions has counteracted this effect.

188
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:34,000
Why highlight the genetic predisposition and ignore the rest of that passage?

189
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,120
Aside from the fact that it basically contradicts everything you're trying to say in your little

190
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,400
Twitter thread.

191
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:45,000
The other slides are similarly irresponsible and do little to represent the actual findings

192
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
of the paper.

193
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,760
If I wanted to cherry pick something that showed fighting dogs were no risk to humans,

194
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,880
I could just post this from the next page.

195
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,440
Aggression towards people.

196
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,400
The fighting dogs of the 19th century generally posed little or no threat to people.

197
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,320
These animals were disqualified in the pit if they exhibited aggression to their handlers

198
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,360
or other people.

199
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,320
Early in this century, several former fighting breeds such as the Bull Terrier and the English

200
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:14,160
Bulldog were specifically selected for their good dispositions around people.

201
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,160
But what is this paper really about, and what argument is it truly making?

202
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,800
We can find that easily enough at the end of the paper where it says, problems of irresponsible

203
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,920
ownership are not unique to pit bulls, nor will they be in the future.

204
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,800
For this reason, we feel that effective animal control legislation must emphasize responsible

205
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,760
and humane ownership of sound animals, as well as responsible supervision of children

206
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,080
and animals when they interact.

207
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,900
So this paper isn't about the evils of pit bulls, but instead advocating for owners

208
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,420
to be held to a higher level of responsibility.

209
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:53,300
It doesn't seem like a good paper to use in a thread about how owners don't matter

210
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,420
when it comes to pit bull aggression.

211
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:02,140
The last three slides all come from Dog Bites to Humans, Demography, Epidemiology, Injury

212
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:07,100
and Risk, published in 2001 in Vet Med Today.

213
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,820
This paper isn't really about pit bulls specifically, but dog bites in general.

214
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:15,900
Less favorable traits could mean anything when talking about all dogs.

215
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:21,460
To get more specific, a few paragraphs later the paper says, investigations of unpredictable

216
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:26,260
aggression have produced no firm results regarding heritability.

217
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,060
The next slide is a bit vague, but you might be interested to know that this comes from

218
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:35,740
a section titled, Issues of Fact and Myth, and the spot he cut off goes on to read, A

219
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:40,100
Careful Reading of the Literature supports three conclusions regarding breed.

220
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,400
The breeds most represented in dog bite data vary over time.

221
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:49,160
Breeds most often represented in published data are popular ones, and no one breed may

222
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,920
be represented in bite data in proportion to its actual population.

223
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:59,080
And pit bull is often applied without biological basis to a range of dog types, regardless

224
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,880
of the underlying genetic stock.

225
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:06,680
So the paper is pretty clear in stating that the pit bull stigma isn't because they're

226
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,680
genetically bad dogs.

227
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:12,720
And the last slide is, surprise surprise, also misleading.

228
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,240
Being just a few lines above it, we can see a fuller use of the text reads, caution is

229
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,560
urged regarding any generalization about inappropriate breed-specific behaviors.

230
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,360
Selection for specific behaviors should be viewed as a risk assessment analysis.

231
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,920
Breeds that have been selected for one or few specific behaviors may be more at risk

232
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,040
for developing undesirable variations on those behaviors.

233
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:41,040
This excerpt comes from a much larger section that, again, isn't specifically about pit

234
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,120
bulls, but dogs in general.

235
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,240
At best, you can try to connect this to how pit bulls may have been bred to be more aggressive

236
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:52,040
to other dogs, but this part of the paper is a discussion of where more research needs

237
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,040
to be done to minimize future dog bites.

238
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:00,040
It's not saying anything about the relative danger posed by pit bulls.

239
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:05,180
Phew, so all the garbage in that thread has been dealt with.

240
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:09,600
It's incredibly difficult to track which dogs are responsible for dog bites, as most people

241
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,000
aren't typically trained to identify dog breeds.

242
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,860
Even people who work at animal shelters often mistake dog breeds.

243
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:22,040
Most reports of dog bites, particularly in the media, but even in scientific literature,

244
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,240
can mistake what breed a dog might actually be.

245
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,280
Here are some pictures to give you an example.

246
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,800
Can you tell which one of these is the American Pit Bull Terrier?

247
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,320
That's one of the four distinct breeds.

248
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,500
And don't worry, none of the other pictures are of the other three distinct pit bull breeds.

249
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,600
If you want to think this over a bit, you should hit pause on the video, because I'm

250
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,880
going to give you exactly no seconds for that.

251
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
It's this one right here.

252
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:52,280
There's even a whole paper on pit bull owners lying by omission about their dog breeds to

253
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,360
other people.

254
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,200
They pretend that their dog isn't bull-blooded, so they're also pretending that their dog

255
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:02,220
isn't more powerful than other dogs by a long stretch and are more likely to attack.

256
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:05,200
That's a very dangerous scheme to play, pit owners.

257
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,360
Brittany Venti brings up a paper titled Managing the Stigma of Outlaw Breeds, a case study

258
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:15,280
of pit bull owners, published in Society and Animals in 2000.

259
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,760
It discusses how pit bull owners often lie to others about their dog in order to avoid

260
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,980
the stigma placed on pit bulls.

261
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,780
The paper explicitly says owners do this not because their dogs are dangerous, but because

262
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,880
of the social stigma attached to them.

263
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,800
Here's a quick excerpt from the paper.

264
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,820
Our work suggests that non-human animals also can be stigmatized, although they will

265
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,820
not have a conscious awareness of this perception.

266
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,020
However, as part of a human animal team, their owners can experience the taintedness that

267
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,940
is commensurate with this stigmatization and resort to various techniques to mitigate,

268
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:54,380
prevent, or improve such adverse perceptions.

269
00:17:54,380 --> 00:18:00,500
Another source Brittany uses is the what to expect if your community is discussing breed-specific

270
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,580
legislation, BSL in brackets.

271
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:08,640
Which isn't actually scientific research, but a set of instructions from an advocacy

272
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,940
group to a municipal government thinking of passing breed-specific legislation.

273
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,880
It's not peer-reviewed, there is no record of where it was published, or even who the

274
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,580
author is.

275
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,020
That's the bare minimum of what you need for something to even look like a proper scientific

276
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,020
source.

277
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:29,300
You may as well just use some asshole's random Twitter account as a source.

278
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:33,580
The video ends with Venti reading some shitty memes, selling merch, and then advocating

279
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,060
for breed-specific legislation.

280
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:38,860
So you guys might be asking, what's the solution to the pit problem?

281
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:42,020
The first solution is to just ban pit bulls.

282
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,620
Some places have already done this and it is an effective way to prevent a lot of the

283
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,500
dog maulings that happen.

284
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,100
There's actually a GoFundMe for that if you guys wish to support it.

285
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:56,140
The CDC and the American Veterinary Medical Association are both against breed-specific

286
00:18:56,140 --> 00:19:00,420
legislation, citing there is no scientific evidence to support it.

287
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,620
BSL laws in the UK were shown to have no real effect on the number of dog bites that led

288
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,740
to hospital admissions, and in my hometown of Toronto, dog bites actually went up after

289
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,820
pit bulls were banned.

290
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:16,900
Results vary by community, but it does show how this legislation is often misguided, and

291
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,700
the money put towards its enforcement might be more effectively used in teaching owners

292
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,780
how to take care of their dogs.

293
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:27,940
And darker still, dogs that are seized as part of BSL laws are impounded, and many of

294
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,060
them are eventually euthanized.

295
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:36,140
But you might be wondering, why is some low-grade conservative making a video about pit bulls?

296
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:43,740
I hinted at elements of racism early on, and please no one hate me for this pun, but this

297
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:45,660
video is a dog whistle.

298
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,100
This guy in the comments heard it.

299
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,380
This dog whistle is being employed by race realists, also known as racists, to propagate

300
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:58,260
the idea that genetics are what drive behavior, and that if we can measure bad behavior in

301
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,740
a specific group, it must be a product of their genes.

302
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:07,420
In other words, they want you to believe that pit bulls are naturally cruel and dangerous,

303
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:11,340
so you'll believe that black people, or any people of color overrepresented in crime

304
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:15,020
statistics are naturally cruel and dangerous too.

305
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,700
The connection between pit bulls and peoples of color is just a nice way to synergize those

306
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:27,620
two things.

307
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:31,100
Here's the rest of the pit bulls story I brought up in the beginning of the video.

308
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,700
In the first half of the 20th century, there was a surge in love for the pit bull in the

309
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,820
United States.

310
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,100
The working class of the country took very fondly to pit bulls, not having the high price

311
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,180
tag of purebreds and fitting in nicely with the idea of the tough working class.

312
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,860
Pit bulls were beloved family pets and minor celebrities across the country.

313
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:54,940
A notable example is the pit bull terrier, Sergeant Stubby, who served in World War I.

314
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,540
Things were growing great for pit bulls for a few decades, but something changed in the

315
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,500
1970s and 80s.

316
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:05,420
Guard dogs and dog fighting had become increasingly common, and so, increasingly common in the

317
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,340
media were reports of dog bites and stories of dog fighting rings.

318
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,500
Guard dogs were popular with Americans who felt they needed protection local law enforcement

319
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,140
couldn't, or wouldn't, offer.

320
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,700
This often included the urban poor as pit bulls were relatively common and far less

321
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:25,660
expensive than purebreds that cost hundreds of dollars.

322
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,580
Pit bulls became popular with dog fighters for similar reasons.

323
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,740
While the vast majority of pit bulls weren't tossed into fighting pits, the ones that were

324
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:38,100
became prominent fixtures in press coverage, and this is where the myth of the vicious

325
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,500
pit bull really begins.

326
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,700
Stories of pit bull attacks, while not necessarily statistically higher than other breeds of

327
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,380
dogs, were frequently seen in newspapers, and once this reputation was created, anyone

328
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,220
who might need a vicious dog would be more inclined to get a pit bull and to raise it

329
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,540
up as such.

330
00:21:55,540 --> 00:22:00,380
This created a cycle that got worse in the 1980s when the war on drugs began.

331
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:04,180
Pit bulls were increasingly associated in media narratives with drug dealers, using

332
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:10,580
them as vicious protectors and drug dealers in the 1980s in the minds of a white suburban

333
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:14,500
readership or black or hispanic.

334
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:19,460
Pit bulls, by proxy, got saddled with the racism that was targeted at their owners,

335
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:25,300
and while some dog breeds, such as Dobermans and St. Bernards, have weathered negative

336
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:30,660
public opinions after a few stories about bites, the association with drugs and some

337
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:43,020
good old-fashioned racism gave pit bulls a stigma that wouldn't fade so easily.

338
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,660
A recent news article uncovered some examples of how alt-right posters on 4chan are trying

339
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:53,020
to push the pit bull meme to advance their usual racist narrative, and certain enablers,

340
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,260
like Brittany Venti, are all too happy to help them along.

341
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,720
Now I don't know for sure if Brittany Venti herself is a racist, I'm not really that

342
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,660
familiar with her work to be honest, but she certainly is being used by them to advance

343
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,140
a narrative.

344
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:13,300
That makes this video deeply irresponsible and dangerously misleading.

345
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,420
The story of the pit bull does have an important lesson.

346
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:21,100
Genes are undoubtedly a part of our behavior, but social influences like breeding pressure

347
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,420
don't create meaningful lasting changes.

348
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,580
All animals are a product of their environment and how their genes interact with it.

349
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:33,540
So instead of treating a dog like a public menace, treat them with love and compassion.

350
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:37,700
And don't let dog discrimination be your gateway into thinking that people who don't look like

351
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,620
you are genetically inferior.
