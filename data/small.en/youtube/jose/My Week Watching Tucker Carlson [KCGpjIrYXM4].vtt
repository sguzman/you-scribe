00:00.000 --> 00:05.620
Tucker Carlson hosts the most popular cable news show on television his most recent ratings show

00:05.620 --> 00:11.360
He averaged 3.2 million viewers a night on Fox News with his Tucker Carlson tonight program

00:11.360 --> 00:15.560
It debuted on November 14th 2016 originally at 7 p.m

00:15.560 --> 00:21.400
But following the cancellation of the O'Reilly Factor Tucker inherited the 8 p.m. Time slot in 2017

00:21.400 --> 00:28.480
The show grew in popularity topping out at four point three three million viewers in the second quarter of 2020 the most viewers ever

00:28.600 --> 00:35.800
For a cable news program in the United States the show proves so popular that Fox News expanded its relationship with Tucker Carlson in the spring

00:35.800 --> 00:42.320
Of 2021 by giving him a morning show Tucker Carlson today that errors three times a week and Tucker Carlson originals

00:42.320 --> 00:46.440
Which airs once a month both of these appearing on the Fox Nation streaming platform

00:46.520 --> 00:52.280
If you're not familiar with who Tucker Carlson is a very brief recap is that he lived a middle-class life as a child

00:52.280 --> 00:57.440
Until his father married into the wealthy Swanson family whose fortune come from those frozen TV dinners

00:57.440 --> 01:02.720
His privileged life led him to a career in journalism where he wrote for a few conservative outlets in

01:02.960 --> 01:05.400
2000 he worked at CNN on a show called crossfire

01:05.400 --> 01:11.560
This show ended when he was embarrassed by John Stewart on camera and Carlson did not renew his CNN contract

01:11.560 --> 01:17.600
He then spent some time at PBS had a show on MSNBC for a few years before finally finding a home at Fox News in

01:17.720 --> 01:24.160
2009 where he was eventually given his own show in 2017 if you want more details about the history of Tucker Carlson

01:24.160 --> 01:30.120
I highly recommend this recap of his life from some more news with all this Tucker Carlson content on offer

01:30.120 --> 01:36.320
I decided to consume a whole week's worth of his stuff to get an idea of what it's like to be in the Tucker Carlson

01:36.320 --> 01:42.680
Audience and what it feels like to get the full effect of his work. This is for the week of October 18th

01:43.480 --> 01:45.480
2021 now

01:45.480 --> 01:55.160
The first part of every episode of Tucker Carlson tonight is the feature story typically rating from 15 to 20 minutes

01:55.160 --> 01:59.240
It makes a path of each episode and is usually the part that has everyone buzzing the next day

01:59.240 --> 02:05.040
These feature stories are largely centered around a monologue where Carlson builds his case and they're capped off with a brief interview

02:05.200 --> 02:08.120
The October 18th edition of the show offers a great example

02:08.120 --> 02:12.720
It began with the recent passing of former United States Secretary of State Colin Powell

02:13.200 --> 02:20.800
Unlike other people in Washington Colin Powell got where he was on merit and that was inspiring to watch and eventually it turned

02:20.800 --> 02:25.240
Into a rant about how Americans are living in a medical apartheid state

02:25.400 --> 02:27.920
We have a division medical apartheid

02:28.080 --> 02:32.840
We have rules but some people have exempted themselves from the rules and they're not ashamed of it

02:32.840 --> 02:35.960
Here's how he made the jump the crucial step in drawing a connection between

02:36.200 --> 02:41.840
Powell's death and this authoritarian nightmare is that Powell died of complications related to COVID-19

02:41.840 --> 02:48.680
Even though he had been vaccinated once this connection is made two minutes into this 14-minute segment. It stops being about Powell entirely

02:49.520 --> 02:55.920
Like almost everyone his age Colin Powell was fully vaccinated against COVID and yet according to his family and doctors

02:55.920 --> 03:00.240
Colin Powell died of COVID. Of course that fact does not make his death any less sad

03:00.560 --> 03:04.960
Nor is it unusual many thousands of vaccinated Americans have died of COVID

03:05.520 --> 03:12.160
Former CDC director Robert Redfield announced just today that about 40% of all recent COVID deaths in the state of Maryland

03:12.160 --> 03:14.640
For example are among those who have had both shots

03:15.200 --> 03:22.240
This is a deeply deceptive stat looking at Maryland alone the eighth most vaccinated state with at the time of writing

03:23.240 --> 03:25.640
65.8% of its population being fully vaccinated

03:25.960 --> 03:32.740
This would mean that breakthrough cases that is cases of vaccinated people suffering from COVID would be more common because such a large

03:32.860 --> 03:34.860
percentage of the state is fully vaccinated

03:34.980 --> 03:40.060
The State Department of Health agrees writing in a statement as the number of our residents who are vaccinated

03:40.740 --> 03:47.660
Continues to increase we expect to see an increase in the proportion of COVID related deaths occurring in vaccinated individuals

03:47.860 --> 03:52.060
Many of these deaths are linked to comorbidities that make patients more vulnerable

03:52.660 --> 03:58.860
Even on its face though if most people are fully vaccinated and the majority of deaths are still attributed to the unvaccinated

03:59.020 --> 04:01.020
It seems like getting a vaccine is a good idea

04:01.100 --> 04:06.780
A wider view of the numbers available from the CDC reveals that COVID deaths are dramatically more common among the unvaccinated

04:06.780 --> 04:10.940
With the unvaccinated being 11 times more likely to die of COVID than the vaccinated

04:11.340 --> 04:15.580
Powell's death is an anecdote a high profile case of something that isn't terribly common

04:15.660 --> 04:18.780
It's being used to push a narrative about skepticism towards the vaccine

04:18.860 --> 04:23.420
It's all a pretense to get to the real message of the segment. What tells you you've been lied to

04:23.900 --> 04:29.420
Vaccines may be highly useful for some people but across a population they do not solve COVID

04:29.740 --> 04:36.220
The language here is crucial. What does solve COVID even mean that a vaccine will completely eliminate it?

04:36.620 --> 04:43.180
Vaccines rarely eradicate illnesses with the only transmissible one among humans that has been wiped out so far being smallpox

04:43.420 --> 04:49.580
The vague usage of solve and how it will never be achieved is how carlson can apply that the vaccine really isn't worth getting

04:49.820 --> 04:57.020
At least for most people without outright denying it has any significant effect at all his earlier statement implies that it's a very narrow effect

04:57.580 --> 04:59.980
Vaccines may be highly useful for some people

05:00.220 --> 05:03.980
The covet vaccine has been demonstrated to dramatically reduce one's chance of death

05:03.980 --> 05:06.860
But the number of deaths aren't the only talking point carlson uses

05:07.180 --> 05:12.140
Carlson also says the vaccine doesn't effectively slow the spread of covet. This also isn't true

05:12.460 --> 05:17.580
Craig spencer an emergency medicine physician and director of global health and emergency medicine at new york

05:17.820 --> 05:21.500
Presbyterian columbia university medical center writing for the atlantic said

05:21.820 --> 05:28.300
Despread the coronavirus you have to have the coronavirus and vaccinated people are far less likely to have the corona virus

05:28.700 --> 05:29.580
period

05:29.580 --> 05:34.940
Even in instances of breakthrough cases where a vaccinated person is infected with the delta variant of covet

05:35.160 --> 05:38.780
Preliminary data shows that transmission is reduced by 63 percent

05:39.020 --> 05:44.940
Albeit for a period of a few months for the alpha variant of covet transmission is even more greatly reduced by a vaccine

05:45.260 --> 05:49.180
Increasing to 73 percent a lot of this data is still being peer reviewed

05:49.180 --> 05:54.220
But so far the majority of the science seems to be saying the exact opposite of what tucker carlson is asserting

05:54.460 --> 05:58.220
But he doesn't say any of it in intent to accurately discuss the science of the day

05:58.380 --> 06:05.900
It's all the guys to get to what he really wants to talk about president biden is demanding obedience and people are fearfully obeying him

06:06.300 --> 06:07.660
They're afraid of you

06:07.660 --> 06:13.100
They can't explain why they're afraid of you the president told them that you are dangerous and so they're afraid

06:14.060 --> 06:20.620
The question is over time. What does that do to your most cherished relationships to your friendship to your family relationships?

06:21.180 --> 06:23.180
What does it do to the country?

06:23.260 --> 06:30.060
The biden administration is apparently using the pandemic to destroy american families or as tucker would put it

06:30.620 --> 06:36.620
America has once again become what it was when colin powell got his commission in the army

06:36.860 --> 06:42.380
America has become segregated not between black and white but between vaccinated and unvaccinated

06:42.860 --> 06:45.740
This is how tucker creates the illusion of a coherent narrative

06:45.900 --> 06:53.500
Colin powell being alive during segregation is purely incidental and segregation itself was a deliberate attempt to restrict black people from positions of

06:53.500 --> 06:56.940
Powered influence within american society because of the color of their skin

06:57.100 --> 07:02.940
Which is hardly the same as not letting someone who is far more likely to carry an infectious disease eat at an applebee's

07:03.500 --> 07:08.540
But what makes tucker carlson particularly effective is that he isn't just spreading partisan talking points

07:08.620 --> 07:11.900
His monologues also include a healthy dose of conspiracy theories

07:12.220 --> 07:18.380
This is a pandemic of the chinese government born in a lab in wuhan and brought here either accidentally or not

07:18.460 --> 07:19.980
That's the fact of it

07:19.980 --> 07:21.900
This is also not a fact

07:21.900 --> 07:27.740
The current state of the debate according to an article in the new yorker is that there is no conclusive evidence to support that claim

07:27.900 --> 07:32.220
And most scientists who study viruses are inclined to say it was a naturally occurring virus

07:32.540 --> 07:39.260
The most plausible version of this theory is that it was being studied at this lab and was accidentally leaked because of a lack of safety precautions

07:39.980 --> 07:42.300
Not that it was created by the chinese government

07:42.940 --> 07:45.500
The rent continues like this for nearly 10 minutes

07:45.580 --> 07:51.980
It's a fire hose of misinformation and by 10 minutes in it's spiraling into madness as a few seconds of video of joe biden

07:51.980 --> 07:55.660
Not wearing a mask at a restaurant is used as evidence of him declaring himself

07:55.900 --> 08:00.540
Some kind of grand ruler as only servants wear masks, but he didn't wear a mask

08:01.100 --> 08:02.140
Why?

08:02.140 --> 08:05.660
Because masks are for servants and he's the president. He's not a servant

08:05.980 --> 08:11.100
The official explanation here is that biden was eating at a restaurant and was in the process of putting his mask back on

08:11.180 --> 08:13.180
Having taken it off to eat his food

08:13.580 --> 08:17.740
Something that I am inclined to believe since you can clearly see him molding the mask as he walks

08:18.060 --> 08:21.980
The video was widely circulated on right-wing media as biden flaunting the rules

08:22.060 --> 08:26.860
But tucker carlson takes it even further saying biden meant to be filmed to send a message to americans

08:27.020 --> 08:32.940
A message that ironically never would have been heard had not right-wing media figures like himself obsessed over it

08:33.260 --> 08:35.100
This clip itself is not a story

08:35.100 --> 08:41.260
But it does offer a wonderful example of how right-wing media takes innocuous footage to concoct a narrative biden being slow to put

08:41.260 --> 08:45.260
His mask on is now him telling america that he is their god king

08:45.580 --> 08:48.220
And wasn't this whole segment about colin pal's death?

08:48.300 --> 08:52.940
And now we're talking about how joe biden being filmed in a restaurant not wearing a mask for a few seconds

08:53.100 --> 08:55.660
Means he's crowning himself the emperor of america

08:55.820 --> 08:58.700
It was as if this whole monologue was written independent of pal's death

08:58.780 --> 09:02.380
And then that part was inserted later to make the narrative seem newsworthy

09:02.460 --> 09:07.100
And one last detail about colin powell carston did eventually share with us also seemed important

09:07.340 --> 09:10.220
So being the show we told you about colin powell

09:10.380 --> 09:14.780
We left out that colin powell was suffering from a number of different health problems

09:15.260 --> 09:18.940
But of course, that's the point the point of vaccinating the vulnerable is so

09:19.500 --> 09:23.500
People with other underlying health problems won't die of covet

09:24.060 --> 09:29.500
But unfortunately that didn't work in the case of general powell and it didn't work for many thousands of other americans

09:29.580 --> 09:31.580
And of course, that's the point we're making in the first place

09:31.900 --> 09:37.900
Colum pal was suffering from multiple myeloma which compromised his immune system making the vaccine less effective

09:38.140 --> 09:44.780
An important detail if you're trying to claim that the vaccine itself is ineffective a detail that completely undermines his entire rant

09:44.940 --> 09:50.060
Which is why it happens more than 25 minutes after the segment is over just as the show is going off the air

09:50.380 --> 09:53.420
Because this rant was a con and tucker carlson knows it

09:53.820 --> 09:58.700
But that monologue was believe it or not the strongest and most convincing one I saw that week

09:58.780 --> 10:02.780
I want to talk about two other ones that show us how things can get really crazy on this show

10:03.260 --> 10:08.380
On october 20th tucker carlson started a show with a segment that had an impressive number of jumps

10:08.620 --> 10:13.580
We started with a statement about how america was changed by the black lives matter movement of 2020

10:13.820 --> 10:15.820
This really was the pivot point

10:15.820 --> 10:18.860
It was the height of the blm riots early last summer

10:19.020 --> 10:25.260
Which turns into a story of how the media lies to people msnbc's explicit editorial policy

10:25.740 --> 10:31.580
To lie about what you were watching live to characterize violent riots as peaceful protests

10:31.660 --> 10:36.700
And then this moves to a discussion about looting the country your ancestors built is on fire

10:37.100 --> 10:39.580
But shut up because your ancestors also burned it down

10:40.060 --> 10:43.980
Which pivots to an article about supply chain issues in the u.s

10:44.300 --> 10:46.700
The washington post just ran this headline and we're quoting

10:47.260 --> 10:51.740
Don't rant about short staff stores and supply chain woes

10:52.300 --> 10:55.580
And apparently america is now falling apart. Don't complain

10:56.780 --> 11:01.820
As your life becomes worse and as your country degrades this leads to a point about store closures

11:02.140 --> 11:08.780
You notice the wall greens is for example closed and so is the cvs because everything in there has been stolen

11:09.100 --> 11:13.980
By thieves who have now been redefined as civil rights protesters. Stop complaining karen

11:14.300 --> 11:19.180
And suddenly we're talking about cities being overrun with drug addicts. Oh, wait a second

11:19.180 --> 11:23.260
They're junkies living intense right across from your kid's school

11:24.060 --> 11:26.860
Well that they've always been there too. They were there when you were a kid

11:26.860 --> 11:33.740
You just never noticed just readjust your expectations settle down karen and their undocumented immigrant rapist on trains

11:34.540 --> 11:39.740
Last week several people on train they got on the train and then they got to watch as a man raped a woman

11:40.140 --> 11:44.860
On the train for minutes and biden's border policy is destroying america

11:45.100 --> 11:50.380
You want more of this? We may be getting it today joe biden's nominee to lead the border patrol a guy called chris magnus

11:50.620 --> 11:52.620
Set for his confirmation hearings

11:52.860 --> 11:57.660
Now it turns out that magnus if anything is to the left of biden

11:57.980 --> 12:00.780
Even to the left of barack obama on immigration matters

12:00.940 --> 12:06.540
Did you follow all that black lives matter is somehow connected to joe biden destroying america with immigrants?

12:07.100 --> 12:13.100
Or the impression carlson's audience more likely got that america is being destroyed and it's biden's fault

12:13.340 --> 12:16.620
The house and wise aren't important. The segment isn't designed to be coherent

12:16.780 --> 12:23.900
It's designed to create a vague feeling of fear about the state of america and to direct that fear and possibly anger towards joe biden

12:24.060 --> 12:27.340
The segment itself is of course filled with misinformation

12:27.660 --> 12:34.080
Take the op-ed from the washington post which tucker claims is an attack on americans telling them to lower their expectations

12:34.540 --> 12:37.920
As if they need to be ready for some kind of socialist hellscape

12:38.540 --> 12:41.580
Lower your expectations. What did you expect in america?

12:42.140 --> 12:44.140
Come on

12:44.140 --> 12:46.140
Bread lines we've always had bread lines

12:46.620 --> 12:53.260
It's sort of charmingly retro these bread lines if we read beyond the headline what the article by micheline manard

12:53.580 --> 12:55.580
Actually says is

12:55.580 --> 13:00.540
Rather than living constantly on the verge of throwing a fit and risking taking it out on overwhelmed servers

13:00.700 --> 13:07.040
Struggling shop owners or late arriving delivery people. We do ourselves a favor by consciously lowering expectations

13:07.500 --> 13:09.340
Rather than being an attack on americans

13:09.420 --> 13:15.340
It's a simple plea for americans not to take their frustrations out on workers who have no control over supply chain issues

13:15.740 --> 13:21.740
Carlson also claims that wall green stores in san francisco are closing because of organized shoplifting. San francisco has

13:22.220 --> 13:26.940
Very few wallgreens or cvs or stores like that left because they've all been looted

13:27.500 --> 13:28.940
by civil rights protesters

13:28.940 --> 13:36.300
This is contradicted by numbers from the police which do not support this wave of shoplifting at wallgreens a narrative codman on social media

13:36.380 --> 13:43.740
Based on a handful of cell phone videos wallgreens has not only refused to share internal data related to shoplifting with reporters in san francisco

13:43.900 --> 13:51.020
Their parent company wallgreens boots alliance was forecasting between 150 and 400 store closures by 2024

13:51.340 --> 13:57.740
since 2016 wallgreens has closed 22 stores in san francisco and those numbers include the recent story tuckers responding to

13:57.900 --> 14:01.180
In which wallgreens had announced it was closing five stores

14:01.660 --> 14:07.900
Now san francisco has very few wallgreens or cvs or stores like that left because they've all been looted

14:08.380 --> 14:13.500
It still has 53 stores operating in san francisco a far cry from what tucker claims

14:13.900 --> 14:18.700
Also not mentioned in this segment is that in new york city wallgreens is shutting down 16 stores

14:18.780 --> 14:23.580
I suspect it might have made it into the segment had they found cell phone footage of a black person stealing something though

14:23.740 --> 14:31.740
Which by the way is used to justify the earlier mention of black lives matter, which was about making shoplifting legal according to tucker carlson

14:32.140 --> 14:38.140
It's also interesting to see how tucker carlson who many describe as a populace parroting the talking points of a corporation like wallgreens

14:38.220 --> 14:44.300
Which happily spreads the organized shoplifting talking point to disguise the fact that it had been planning to close stores

14:44.600 --> 14:47.340
regardless of this supposed wave of shoplifting

14:47.980 --> 14:53.340
Perhaps tucker is happily towing this corporate line because it at least lets him demonize black communities

14:54.220 --> 14:57.420
It's the jumps that really make this segment more than misinformation though

14:57.500 --> 15:03.180
The narrative through line of america's decay is barely held together as tucker jumps from one sensationalized story to another

15:03.260 --> 15:08.460
And he uses folksy little turns of phrase or rolls out the carrot insult to engage his audience emotionally

15:08.940 --> 15:15.340
This isn't designed to get people thinking about the news of the day. It's designed to rally their emotions against the left

15:16.220 --> 15:22.780
Tucker carlson's opening stories are so narrative focused that sometimes he doesn't even need to misrepresent actual news stories

15:22.940 --> 15:27.020
In some cases he just presents something made up entirely out of nothing

15:27.260 --> 15:30.540
That is so obviously true in the october 21st show

15:30.780 --> 15:35.120
This segment opens with some truly shocking footage released by the biden administration

15:45.340 --> 16:08.700
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday to my president, happy birthday to you

16:09.660 --> 16:15.020
Before moving on I want everyone to take a moment and think about what this video says

16:15.260 --> 16:16.860
And you don't need any deep analysis here

16:16.860 --> 16:23.100
Just think about the events you saw unfold and what they were about really ask yourself. Does anything seem amiss here?

16:23.420 --> 16:25.740
Does this footage reveal some hidden truth?

16:26.460 --> 16:28.860
Okay, here's what tucker thought when he watched that video

16:29.100 --> 16:34.780
It's like a room full of aliens have gathered to act out this concept. They've just heard about called happiness

16:35.500 --> 16:38.780
The head alien is a super naturally strange being called

16:39.320 --> 16:45.580
Kamala harris who for reasons no one ever explains walks into a room in the most secure building in the world

16:45.820 --> 16:52.540
With a piece of elasti-sized fabric over her face like that's totally normal just another masked birthday celebration

16:53.340 --> 17:00.960
harris suddenly yells surprise at her own surprise birthday party like she's hosting the event for one of her multiple personalities

17:01.900 --> 17:03.740
What the hell is going on here?

17:03.740 --> 17:10.300
I can answer that question harris acted awkwardly during a surprise birthday party and everyone is wearing masks because of covet

17:10.620 --> 17:13.100
But tucker has to pretend this is some bizarre

17:13.400 --> 17:19.340
unthinkable scenario where people are acting in strange and confusing ways ways that reveal a deep mental rot at the core of the

17:19.340 --> 17:20.380
biden white house

17:20.380 --> 17:26.140
He goes on for several minutes about these videos making a number of strange points like that. No one says gorgeous anymore

17:26.460 --> 17:31.440
She goes on to use the word gorgeous a word that no actual human being has used since 1977

17:32.400 --> 17:39.520
I am completely willing to believe no one calls tucker gorgeous, but that doesn't mean no one says it. First of all is the answer. Yes

17:42.880 --> 17:51.680
Ready to work. I am ready to do this with you for you. I I just i'm just deeply honored and i'm very excited

17:54.880 --> 17:56.480
Whoa

17:56.480 --> 18:01.840
Indeed nearly six minutes in and all tucker is talking about are these social media posts

18:01.840 --> 18:04.080
He's calling them staged and even if they are

18:04.720 --> 18:11.920
So what their pieces of pr are designed to make president biden and vice president harris seem more human and relatable much like your grandpa

18:12.080 --> 18:14.640
Joe biden also doesn't know how to turn off a speakerphone

18:15.200 --> 18:20.320
If these moments are staged the fact that none of these people are actors should explain the awkward delivery

18:20.400 --> 18:26.080
But to tucker carlson, there's something far more sinister more sinister than north korean military propaganda

18:27.120 --> 18:30.160
But what's the message of the joe and kamala videos?

18:30.880 --> 18:34.720
All your nightmares are real the people in charge are even worse than you thought they were

18:35.280 --> 18:38.160
Kamala may have seemed kind of fake to you joe may have looked a little out of it

18:38.320 --> 18:42.160
But actually the white house is now telling us you don't know the half of it

18:42.720 --> 18:47.600
According to tucker the white house is trying to tell everyone that these people are losing their mind or robots

18:47.760 --> 18:53.040
These are presented as basic readings of these videos and not right-wing spin and that's what makes it so effective

18:53.280 --> 18:58.000
The phrasing demands the audience accept the basic premise just to get to the conspiracy theory

18:58.080 --> 19:04.080
You must believe joe biden is senile before getting to the idea that this is a deliberate move by the white house to rub it

19:04.080 --> 19:05.520
in everyone's faces

19:05.520 --> 19:09.360
Why they would do this is never really explored the conspiracy theory is a bonus

19:09.600 --> 19:15.840
Because the main point here is to reinforce the idea that joe biden is senile and that kamala harris is some kind of robot

19:16.320 --> 19:21.760
This is one third of the way into this night's commentary and have you spotted anything newsworthy so far?

19:22.080 --> 19:28.640
All we've seen is tucker carlson opine about some harmless social media pr posts, but it does get even more intense

19:28.960 --> 19:32.960
In december of last year kamala harris who grew up in canada a foreign country

19:33.280 --> 19:37.920
I appreciate the subtle menace tucker carlson has when he describes canada as a foreign country

19:38.080 --> 19:44.160
We usually don't get much credit for how scary we are tucker is really shocked at how brazen a lie harris told was though

19:44.480 --> 19:50.720
Swore that she witnessed quote multiple generations of her family celebrating kwanza an american holiday

19:50.800 --> 19:57.840
That was invented in long beach california after kamala harris was born. Not one word is true, but not one word is believable

19:58.560 --> 20:03.120
Again, it was a prepared statement. It was carefully considered. They didn't even bother to look at a calendar

20:04.000 --> 20:09.520
Luckily for us. I did look at a calendar kamala harris was born in 1964 in california

20:09.680 --> 20:12.480
The american celebration of kwanza was first held in

20:13.740 --> 20:20.640
1966 so the idea of kamala harris celebrating this with her family including parents and grandparents as a child seems pretty reasonable

20:21.040 --> 20:24.820
This is likely what she meant when she said celebrating across generations

20:25.360 --> 20:30.400
As for the canada part harris was born in california and moved to montreal when she was 12

20:30.640 --> 20:34.160
She moved back to the us at 18 to attend howard university in washington d.c

20:34.400 --> 20:40.740
So is it really hard to imagine that between the ages of 2 and 12 she might have celebrated kwanza with her parents and grandparents

20:41.600 --> 20:44.000
Also kwanza may have started in the u.s

20:44.000 --> 20:50.400
But it's celebrated in canada too and even if it wasn't there are no canadian laws preventing american families

20:50.400 --> 20:56.880
From celebrating kwanza in montreal the segment is nearly 10 minutes through and it's completely filled with stuff like this

20:57.120 --> 21:00.400
Tucker carlson reacting to dopey videos released by the white house

21:00.640 --> 21:04.800
This is the news he thinks is worth commenting on and to make it seem worthwhile

21:04.960 --> 21:10.640
He needs to make it sound as dramatic and scary as possible. It goes as far as to compare it to a cult

21:11.280 --> 21:13.280
It's kind of nuts when you think about it

21:13.520 --> 21:19.360
These people literally have no idea how absurd they look and how could they they live in a tiny airless cult

21:19.600 --> 21:23.600
Wherever one pretends that joe biden is fully competent. Kamala harris is a civil rights hero

21:24.080 --> 21:31.200
It's jones town and he brings a guest on to tell us that these videos are somehow related to communism

21:31.520 --> 21:35.680
It's because every part of the system is so corrupt now and rotted with this communist filth

21:35.840 --> 21:40.800
And that would you think of everyone here as sociopaths these people are not capable of that kind of shame

21:40.800 --> 21:44.240
It's not in their nature. They are completely lost. They're sociopaths all of them

21:44.400 --> 21:51.280
This is literally all this segment is I suspect the jesse keller interview only went on as long as it did over three minutes

21:51.440 --> 21:53.840
Because of how little substance was actually present

21:54.000 --> 22:01.120
I'm genuinely impressed that tucker carlson took something as flat and sparse of content such as pr videos on white house social media

22:01.280 --> 22:06.400
And turned it into a narrative about some kind of biden cult slash obama's third term

22:06.640 --> 22:10.400
This is obama's third term and these people are picked because they're compliant and hollow

22:10.560 --> 22:17.680
But this segment more than all the others demonstrates what this show does it takes news stories or sometimes things that are barely news

22:17.760 --> 22:24.500
Events lies about them and then builds these fantastic narratives of cults and oppression to oppose the biden administration

22:24.880 --> 22:30.480
Isn't to have a political disagreement. It's to be standing against the monstrous sociopaths who want to destroy america

22:30.640 --> 22:37.280
It catastrophizes political reality to such an extreme that the opposition can only be understood as the most dire of threats

22:37.600 --> 22:42.880
And then tucker will in the same breath complain about how the other side is trying to divide us

22:43.200 --> 22:50.320
Which is rich coming from someone who uses a video about flowers being delivered to push a narrative about a cult destroying america

22:51.360 --> 22:54.560
While the opening segment is tucker carlson's show at its purest

22:54.800 --> 22:58.240
The show does go on for another 20 to 25 minutes after it's over

22:58.400 --> 23:05.200
These are the quick hits where five or six different stories are crammed into tiny segments that leave the audience less informed and more afraid

23:05.760 --> 23:10.160
Here's a quick example of a story from the october 18th episode in recent weeks

23:10.460 --> 23:18.080
Thousands of illegal aliens have been flown from the texas border into westchester county airport in new york on charter jets

23:18.640 --> 23:24.800
Presented as breaking news is the story of children being flown from the southern us border to new york

23:24.960 --> 23:29.840
He interviews conservative new york post columnist miranda divine for details by the government

23:29.840 --> 23:32.000
They were all unaccompanied children

23:32.000 --> 23:37.360
But several of them did look to us to be males in their 20s late teens

23:37.680 --> 23:43.120
Some of the language here should raise some alarm according to the government the people being brought to new york are all children

23:43.200 --> 23:49.120
But according to divine some of them looked older the photos used on tv make it tough to tell

23:49.200 --> 23:51.200
But if you look at the new york post article

23:51.200 --> 23:58.000
There are much clearer photos of these people who are obviously children as they're significantly shorter than the man who is escorting them

23:58.320 --> 24:03.840
Also when divine claims that these flights are coming in the dead of night that isn't what we're seeing in these photos

24:04.240 --> 24:09.760
According to the article these photos were of flights that arrived at 9 52 pm and 10 49 pm

24:10.080 --> 24:13.360
There is a record of two flights landing at 2 13 a.m

24:13.360 --> 24:19.120
And 4 29 a.m on august 20th, but these are the only examples offered in the article that might be considered

24:19.520 --> 24:20.720
The dead of night

24:20.720 --> 24:26.320
It then describes that these children are being sent to family members and those without family members are going to an organization called

24:26.640 --> 24:33.440
Mercy first which works with the u.s office of refugee resettlement to find kids who have been granted refugee status safe homes

24:33.920 --> 24:38.720
These brief few minutes are used to illustrate that the biden administration is somehow breaking the law

24:39.040 --> 24:43.520
and that it needs to offer greater transparency on where refugee children are being settled because

24:44.000 --> 24:49.520
Well, they never really say why tucker does mention that some kind of federal law is being violated

24:49.760 --> 24:53.520
But he doesn't say which one and the only evidence of something nefarious going on

24:53.520 --> 24:56.880
Is that some of these flights might be past the bedtimes of these children?

24:57.200 --> 25:01.520
They can't come out and say what they want their audience to think because that wouldn't be as safe as the dog whistle

25:01.520 --> 25:06.960
They're using instead. This is a segment designed to portray refugee children as a danger to america

25:07.200 --> 25:11.840
Tucker Carlson tonight crams in five to six of these segments every night in its second half

25:12.160 --> 25:19.040
Much like the opening segment the rife with conspiracy theories such as vaccines for military personnel being used to get christians out of the military

25:19.520 --> 25:21.520
So by forcing this

25:21.520 --> 25:24.960
You get to find out who sincerely believes in god

25:25.280 --> 25:30.560
And then you know, you know their names at that point and then you can expel them using the pretext of the covid vaccine

25:30.880 --> 25:33.040
The ufo is going after american nukes

25:33.660 --> 25:36.880
UFOs interacted with nuclear weapons platforms

25:37.520 --> 25:40.960
And either rendered them inoperable or took them offline

25:41.280 --> 25:48.000
The content matters less than the general feeling these segments create to distrust any mainstream narrative and to believe any story tucker

25:48.080 --> 25:50.080
Is telling you no matter how outlandish

25:50.640 --> 25:52.080
All these different topics

25:52.080 --> 25:57.040
Particularly the ones that are highlighted in the second half of the show are a means to maintain talking points

25:57.120 --> 26:03.360
That aren't necessarily the hot topic of the moment such as critical race theory or affirmative consent on college campuses

26:03.760 --> 26:10.960
The vague general threats of non-white people and feminism is kept alive in the minds of viewers whenever stories like these are referenced

26:11.440 --> 26:16.880
It also gives them the appearance of legitimacy as if these are ongoing issues that need to be monitored rather than

26:17.040 --> 26:23.680
Completely fabricated stories that are simply maintained by a dedicated right-wing media to ensure that the audience doesn't forget that

26:24.000 --> 26:29.600
Even though they're not the topic at the moment sometime in the future. This is a group. We might need to scapegoat again

26:30.080 --> 26:33.600
So while the big monologues get a lot of the attention including in this video

26:33.840 --> 26:41.120
These smaller segments really add up to something truly nefarious the impression that these right-wing narratives are part of a persistent

26:41.360 --> 26:48.080
World view one that can be maintained in the minds of viewers through constant attention not through big tentpole stories

26:48.640 --> 26:52.880
These segments typically include short interviews often not running for more than two or three minutes

26:52.960 --> 26:56.560
They make a perfect backdrop for how tucker carlson presents stories on his show

26:56.720 --> 27:00.320
Typically, there are four reasons why a news program might include an interview

27:00.400 --> 27:05.040
The first is to provide additional information to a story in his october 21st episode

27:05.200 --> 27:11.040
Tucker carlson had a short four-minute segment on a memo issued by attorney general mary garland directing the fbi

27:11.120 --> 27:17.920
To investigate the increasing number of violent threats towards school board members over covid related safety requirements fears over critical race theory

27:18.000 --> 27:21.200
And other culture war narratives popularized on right-wing media

27:21.520 --> 27:28.000
These threats are very real as there are several videos that can be found of school board meetings being disrupted by crowds of angry parents

27:28.080 --> 27:33.680
Who use incendiary language including death threats have you yourself received death threats?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.080
I have

27:36.080 --> 27:38.080
It's terrifying

27:38.720 --> 27:41.840
It has an effect on you that you can't really put into words

27:42.560 --> 27:44.560
when someone describes

27:44.880 --> 27:46.880
the way they want to

27:47.200 --> 27:48.800
Come into your home

27:48.800 --> 27:54.560
And end your life. Here's another example of parents upset that their kids might be expected to wear masks at school

28:00.960 --> 28:06.640
The threats have gotten so bad that the national school boards association has requested help specifically from the fbi

28:06.880 --> 28:11.120
But this isn't the part of the story tucker carlson shares on his show according to carlson

28:11.440 --> 28:17.120
The controversy here is that garland did not disclose that his son-in-law runs a company called panorama education

28:17.360 --> 28:20.720
Which has in a various intent panorama makes a ton of money

28:21.040 --> 28:26.400
Pushing racist propaganda the kind that parents are complaining about and how does panorama education do that?

28:26.720 --> 28:30.240
By creating surveys for children that measure their school experience

28:30.720 --> 28:33.840
He brings on azeron omani to provide the evidence

28:34.240 --> 28:37.760
They are asking children from hawaii to mean

28:38.320 --> 28:43.600
What what about their sexuality their gender and they're also asking these questions of their parents

28:44.240 --> 28:48.960
Not being someone who trusts anybody who wears a shirt that says they aren't a domestic terrorist

28:49.120 --> 28:52.400
Which is exactly what a domestic terrorist not wanting to be discovered would do

28:52.800 --> 28:57.440
I decided to look into these surveys myself which are helpfully posted on panorama education's website

28:57.760 --> 29:01.920
Although there are multiple surveys. I couldn't find a single one asking kids about their sexuality

29:02.160 --> 29:06.080
There was one question about gender identity though. It dared to ask a child

29:06.400 --> 29:07.600
What is your gender?

29:07.600 --> 29:14.560
But other than that there wasn't anything else on sex and gender that I could see there were definitely questions about race and culture though

29:14.860 --> 29:21.760
specifically on pages 28 and 29 out of 56 that asks kids in grades 6 through 12 questions such as

29:22.240 --> 29:27.200
How often do teachers encourage you to learn about people from different races ethnicities or cultures?

29:27.440 --> 29:32.480
And another one is how fairly do adults at your school treat people from different races ethnicities or cultures?

29:33.040 --> 29:38.080
Not exactly what I would call nefarious and perfectly fitting in a survey that also asks kids

29:38.240 --> 29:40.480
How much support do the adults at your school give you?

29:40.800 --> 29:46.080
And how confident are you that you can complete all the work that is assigned in your subject class?

29:46.560 --> 29:48.560
Merely asking a question about race is

29:48.720 --> 29:52.240
According to nomani indoctrinating kids with critical race theory

29:52.960 --> 29:57.760
These types of interviews that add additional information to a story are surprisingly rare though

29:58.000 --> 30:04.400
Other interviews you might see on carlson's show are ones that add emotional context such as when a news event impacts a particular group

30:04.720 --> 30:09.280
Interviewing someone from that group puts a human face on the issue providing emotional context

30:09.520 --> 30:14.720
We'll have some better examples of that later on but the closest version of this I saw on tucker carlson tonight

30:14.880 --> 30:21.440
Was when the show discussed the recent dave chappelle netflix special and the backlash over his comments about the trans community

30:21.680 --> 30:27.680
Tucker carlson interviewed seth dylan of the babylon b apparently for his response as a comedian

30:28.320 --> 30:32.800
Another type of interview you might see on tucker carlson's show is someone with an opposing viewpoint

30:33.120 --> 30:36.800
Something that has happened in the past but did not happen on the week

30:36.800 --> 30:41.040
I watched and for what I can gather doesn't happen all that often on the show in general

30:41.280 --> 30:46.340
Particularly after carlson made the mistake of inviting on dutch historian rutger bregman

30:46.800 --> 30:48.480
You might not like it

30:48.480 --> 30:53.700
But you're a millionaire funded by billionaires, and that's the reason why you're not talking about these issues

30:59.040 --> 31:04.720
Yeah, only now come on you jumped a bandwagon you're all like oh i'm against a globalist the lead blah blah blah

31:05.600 --> 31:07.600
It's not very convincing to be honest

31:08.160 --> 31:13.120
Honestly if I ever get the chance to be speaking to someone like tucker carlson

31:13.360 --> 31:17.520
I wanted to go down exactly like that the type of interview that is by far

31:17.680 --> 31:24.000
The most common on tucker carlson tonight is the supposed expert who comes on to affirm everything tucker carlson has been saying

31:24.320 --> 31:26.320
Given it the illusion of authority

31:26.800 --> 31:29.920
Examples of this are well more than I can fit in this video

31:30.000 --> 31:36.240
Here's one I enjoyed though in the october 18th episode tucker had a brief segment about an interview with christopher steel

31:36.480 --> 31:39.520
Whose dossier included a number of accusations toward president trump?

31:39.920 --> 31:46.400
Perhaps most notably the one where there's apparently a tape in vladimir putin's possession of women who trump hired to pee on a bed

31:46.560 --> 31:48.800
That obama had slept in during his trip to russia

31:49.200 --> 31:57.920
This segment itself is a rehashed complaint about how the investigation into those supposed russian connections unfairly hamstrung the trump administration's foreign policy

31:58.160 --> 32:01.840
And to discuss this carlson brings on cash patel and devon nunez

32:02.240 --> 32:05.040
Patel and nunez add very little of substance in their interview

32:05.120 --> 32:07.520
They vaguely allude to their own personal issues

32:07.600 --> 32:13.120
But the interview lasts less than three minutes giving them in only moments to answer three questions between the two of them

32:13.520 --> 32:18.960
Their primary purpose seems to be to agree with tucker about everything and then deliver zingers like this one

32:19.120 --> 32:21.760
This guy is no hero. He is no james bond

32:22.000 --> 32:26.240
He's inspector gadget on pseudofed and now he's crying for the world to love him

32:26.560 --> 32:30.480
Maybe he can get a job with the babylon b these interviews are by far the most common ones

32:30.480 --> 32:31.280
I saw during the week

32:31.280 --> 32:36.720
I watched this show figures who show up not along with everything tucker carlson said and then make a quick exit

32:36.960 --> 32:40.800
Used to cap off a segment as if it now has an authoritative stamp of approval

32:41.120 --> 32:43.440
That's what tucker crossing gets from these brief interviews

32:43.520 --> 32:48.640
But I imagine the guests themselves get to expose themselves to tucker's massive audience and be presented as a friendly face

32:48.640 --> 32:52.400
They can trust because they agree with the same nonsense tucker carlson spreads on his show

32:52.960 --> 32:57.200
These are the interviews tucker carlson only conducts on his tucker carlson tonight program

32:57.520 --> 33:00.080
There are other sources for people to get their tucker fix

33:00.720 --> 33:02.800
And in the case of tucker carlson today

33:03.200 --> 33:07.120
It's a long-form interview show that airs on the fox nation streaming service

33:07.440 --> 33:14.560
While short segments of these interviews find their way onto tucker carlson tonight the full 50 plus minute interviews are exclusive to fox nation

33:15.200 --> 33:19.120
It's here where tucker carlson really digs into the thoughts and opinions of his guests

33:19.520 --> 33:25.200
Not like the snippets we see on his fox news show and as you might have guessed tucker's guests also enjoyed agreeing with him

33:25.520 --> 33:26.160
To be fair

33:26.160 --> 33:30.000
These interviews are absolutely in the first category of the ones I outlined above

33:30.240 --> 33:34.640
As these new guests provide lots of new information relative to the narrative being offered though

33:34.720 --> 33:38.960
Ultimately these discussions support the same kind of narrative tucker carlson pushes on his main show

33:39.420 --> 33:41.280
conservative conspiracy theories

33:41.280 --> 33:46.800
Before diving in I should note that while this show typically airs three times a week mondays wednesdays and fridays

33:47.040 --> 33:49.440
Tucker carlson took october 22nd off

33:49.600 --> 33:53.120
So I only have two episodes to work with though for the sake of my own sanity

33:53.200 --> 33:55.360
That was an hour of tucker carlson. I was spared

33:55.680 --> 34:02.640
The first of the two interviews was with elbridge colby a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development

34:02.720 --> 34:05.540
At the department of defense during the trump administration

34:06.000 --> 34:12.240
He's a peculiar guest at least for a friendly interview considering how much of tucker carlson's branding is that he stands up to the elites

34:12.240 --> 34:18.800
And insider types of washington when the interview starts tucker tries to establish that colby definitely isn't one of those people

34:19.200 --> 34:24.880
If you scour the foreign policy establishment in washington, everyone's either implicated in the disasters

34:24.880 --> 34:30.800
We're watching now or there's some kind of crazed neocon ideologue who you would not ask to babysit your children

34:31.440 --> 34:33.040
Because they're that untrustworthy

34:33.040 --> 34:39.760
So there are very few people whose opinion matters from our perspective on this topic and elbridge colby is one of them

34:40.000 --> 34:45.920
Colby having some sense of the show he's on tries to do the same by claiming to have been against the war in iraq

34:46.480 --> 34:50.480
But yeah, then i've been working in kind of the national security area for the last 20 years. I entered

34:51.280 --> 34:56.560
Dc as a very junior guy right around the time of the iraq, you know fever before the war

34:57.120 --> 35:01.520
And i'd say that kind of set me in one direction because I was not not a not a fan

35:01.600 --> 35:03.600
I mean my opinion didn't matter at all at that time

35:04.000 --> 35:09.440
A quick look at colby's bio reveal that he was part of the coalition provisional authority in iraq in 2003

35:09.840 --> 35:15.920
Which was set up by the bush administration to help reshape the country and was also plagued by insider groans from washington

35:16.080 --> 35:23.120
Something extensively written about in the 2006 book imperial life in the emerald city inside iraq's green zone by rajiv chandra

35:23.180 --> 35:30.320
Sakaran being part of the authority that was reshaping iraq in 2003 is a curious place to be for someone who didn't support the war

35:30.560 --> 35:35.280
After his time in iraq colby continued to work in government for a number of years and before joining the trump administration

35:35.680 --> 35:41.840
Was part of the center for a new american security a think tank that is partially funded by a number of defense contractors

35:41.920 --> 35:43.200
And of course the u.s

35:43.200 --> 35:48.960
Government he's on tucker carlson's show to talk about the looming threat of china and how a military response might be the only option

35:49.120 --> 35:56.240
In short colby seems like one of the washington insiders that tucker claims to have some deep resentment for but as we learn in this interview

35:56.720 --> 36:03.220
Carlson and colby are friends and colby has a book to sell and those things are more important than the facade of tucker's anti-imperialism

36:04.000 --> 36:07.600
Much of this interview is colby firing off talking points about the danger of china

36:07.760 --> 36:12.960
And he doesn't make a terribly compelling case for his position tucker carlson is very weird in this interview

36:13.040 --> 36:17.920
Although the fear mongering about china is on brand his questioning constantly reverts to the talking points

36:17.920 --> 36:21.920
He usually has on his show while colby is more willing to give the typical answers

36:21.920 --> 36:28.240
You'd see from a washington insider military hawk carlson keeps dredging up some of the bogus culture war narratives in response

36:28.640 --> 36:30.400
greatest

36:30.400 --> 36:31.760
adversary

36:31.760 --> 36:32.960
was russia

36:32.960 --> 36:36.000
Under vladimir putin and then biden is elected

36:36.400 --> 36:41.440
And the new secretary of defense tells us that the single greatest adversaries in fact within our borders and it's white men

36:42.000 --> 36:44.500
the u.s military seems demoralized

36:45.300 --> 36:51.700
And its leadership seems completely distracted by irrelevant concerns like white rage and transgenderism

36:51.700 --> 36:58.820
That's the outsider's perspective colby deflects a lot of these questions and comments and his tactic seems to be to constantly complement tucker and his show

36:59.060 --> 37:04.980
And and I applaud your your focus on this issue and any institution that is above account accountability will fail

37:05.060 --> 37:08.420
I mean, I think that's a point that you always stress and I completely agree with it. All the world

37:08.420 --> 37:10.340
It's not a terribly interesting interview though

37:10.340 --> 37:17.220
I was impressed that even in this dry discussion about american foreign policy tucker carlson still made time to insert some conspiracy theories

37:17.380 --> 37:20.180
The japanese bomb for harbor. They did corregator the baton death march

37:20.180 --> 37:26.900
They bended nurses in hong kong, etc, etc. And then we got really really angry. Well, that's where roosevelt allowed it, right?

37:29.700 --> 37:31.700
He clearly did but whatever okay

37:34.020 --> 37:37.780
I should stress that there is no evidence whatsoever that this is true

37:38.020 --> 37:41.540
I've linked an article from npr on the subject below if you want to read more about it

37:41.780 --> 37:47.220
And he cranks up some real fear on china by asking what one of their nukes would do to an american city modern nuclear weapons

37:47.220 --> 37:48.900
Are more powerful

37:48.900 --> 37:54.580
What kind of effect would a modern nuclear bomb have on an american population center?

37:55.060 --> 37:57.060
Tucker carlson claims to be an anti-interventionist

37:57.700 --> 38:04.580
And someone opposed to the american tendency to push itself into conflicts around the world in an effort to expand or maintain its hegemonic influence

38:04.580 --> 38:10.900
But in this interview, he is reinforcing the very common talking point something you see in both parties about china being an existential threat

38:10.980 --> 38:13.540
And discussing the need for a potential military response

38:13.700 --> 38:18.020
It speaks to the game tucker carlson is playing claiming to be a populace speaking for americans

38:18.260 --> 38:25.220
Specifically conservative ones who have been ignored by the republican establishment and then turning around and inviting insiders like colby on to have

38:25.220 --> 38:29.540
A friendly chat about the american military possibly being in an open conflict with china

38:29.700 --> 38:32.580
He does the same thing on tucker carlson tonight when in the week

38:32.580 --> 38:38.340
I watched he had on politicians including senator josh holly and governor ron desantis for friendly conversations

38:38.580 --> 38:42.900
Tucker carlson can pretend to be firmly against the neo-cons who sent the us into iraq

38:43.060 --> 38:48.100
But the figureheads from back then are gone and carlson is happy to play nice with their ideological successors

38:48.180 --> 38:51.860
While the branding of populism may be popular he'll happily cozy up to politicians

38:51.860 --> 38:57.940
He can convince his audience represent their interests even when they clearly serve a wealthier class. It sure is helpful branding though

38:58.740 --> 39:03.460
The other episode of tucker carlson today. I watched was far more on brand on october 20th

39:03.700 --> 39:08.980
Tucker welcomed professor dorian abbott to talk about how he had recently been canceled by the woke mob

39:09.140 --> 39:14.260
There is some backstory here in 2020 professor abbott a geophysicist at the university of chicago

39:14.340 --> 39:21.220
Had some complaints about how diversity equity and inclusion groups were impacting the selection process for graduate student candidates and faculty hires

39:21.620 --> 39:23.220
Like all reasonable academics

39:23.220 --> 39:29.700
He voiced his concern via a youtube video since taken down which was responded to by a letter signed by over

39:29.860 --> 39:36.020
100 students faculty and alumni calling for the university to allow students to withdraw from his classes without penalty

39:36.260 --> 39:41.540
Ultimately, the university president sided with abbott and he faced no administrative disciplinary measures

39:41.860 --> 39:44.500
Of course, this was not why abbott was brought on to tucker carlson's show

39:44.740 --> 39:50.740
Most recently abbott co-wrote an article for newsweek with stanford associate professor evan marinovich once again

39:50.980 --> 39:56.180
voicing concern about the impact of diversity equity and inclusion proposing that someone's identity

39:56.500 --> 39:58.980
Should have no impact for post-secondary admissions

39:59.220 --> 40:05.620
One interesting aspect of this article is that abbott briefly mentions that his proposal would also eliminate legacy admissions as well

40:05.780 --> 40:09.620
Which is the practice of a school typically seen in elite ivy league schools

40:09.780 --> 40:13.300
Giving students preference if they had a family member who attended the institution

40:13.540 --> 40:15.380
While it's lovely to see this be mentioned

40:15.380 --> 40:20.900
It seems strange that abbott only mentions it in passing and it comes off as a defense against people calling him racist

40:21.220 --> 40:27.700
If anything legacy admissions seem far more unfair as it doesn't just help individuals from racial backgrounds that typically have privilege

40:27.860 --> 40:34.020
But it goes that extra step of ensuring that someone from an already wealthy family gets special consideration for a spot at some of the best

40:34.020 --> 40:36.740
Schools in the world so it discriminates based on class as well

40:37.140 --> 40:41.460
Had abbott come out hard against legacy admissions rather than diversity admissions

40:41.460 --> 40:46.100
We might be viewing him entirely different, but it was diversity that was his main target

40:46.420 --> 40:52.100
In this article abbott makes no mention of the research that demonstrates how his field of geophysics is hostile towards faculty

40:52.260 --> 40:57.540
That aren't white men such as himself and that there are active biases against women and non-white racial groups

40:57.620 --> 41:02.980
And that these diversity programs are designed to undercut that bias by breaking down the systems that prevent inclusion

41:03.140 --> 41:10.100
He also seems unaware that greater diversity within groups creates more novel hypotheses and actually expand research potential not limit it

41:10.260 --> 41:16.980
Professor abbott seems to be under the impression that science faculties are untouched by these biases and exist in realms of pure reason

41:17.060 --> 41:21.860
Where facts and evidence are all that matter and a person's identity couldn't possibly impact their work

41:22.180 --> 41:25.860
He seems unaware of the academic research that undermined this idea

41:26.100 --> 41:30.340
Which is strange because those studies that you saw flash on screen as I was talking about those topics

41:30.420 --> 41:33.060
Were all included in the letter complaining about him in 2020

41:33.220 --> 41:37.780
It's almost as if he either didn't read them or simply has no interest in acknowledging them

41:38.180 --> 41:43.220
That aside what probably drew the most attention in this article is this passage towards the end 90 years ago

41:43.300 --> 41:49.380
Germany had the best universities in the world then an ideological regime obsessed with race came to power and drove many of the best

41:49.460 --> 41:54.980
Scholars out cutting the faculties and leading to sustained decay that german universities never fully recovered from

41:55.380 --> 42:01.060
We should view this as a warning of the consequences of viewing group membership as more important than merit and correct our course

42:01.060 --> 42:02.580
Before it is too late

42:02.580 --> 42:06.500
If professor abbott is interested in starting a conversation about university admissions

42:06.580 --> 42:11.620
I'm not sure comparing diversity equity and inclusion programs to the nazis is a helpful talking point

42:11.860 --> 42:17.700
Also, there's something truly grotesque about comparing an effort to help marginalized peoples have better access to higher education

42:17.860 --> 42:20.900
With the effort from nazis to keep those groups out of universities

42:21.060 --> 42:26.500
It seems more like the exact opposite of what's going on anyone can make grossly reductive points like this

42:26.580 --> 42:31.940
I could say the allies in world war ii were just like the nazis because when they were at war both militaries killed soldiers on

42:31.940 --> 42:36.260
The opposite side, but that would be a silly comparison that removes all nuance from the discussion

42:36.740 --> 42:38.900
But maybe tucker carlson will bring this up in the interview

42:39.460 --> 42:44.980
Except no, definitely not we're gonna get stuff like this instead. I don't think i've ever seen a college professor

42:45.620 --> 42:48.980
Lay out in such clear and I will say gentle

42:50.740 --> 42:53.700
Terms, um as you did what's at stake?

42:54.020 --> 43:00.020
I'm not sure a nazi comparison is all that gentle the rest of the interview goes the way you might expect with tucker praising abbott

43:00.020 --> 43:07.320
At every turn and some questionable responses being treated as a matter of fact, for example, professor abbott complains about certain ideologies

43:07.780 --> 43:09.780
I was uncomfortable with

43:09.940 --> 43:15.940
With ideologies that discourage discourse because when you can't speak with the other side

43:16.420 --> 43:21.060
The only recourse is violence. Yes, and I saw that playing out in the summer of 2020

43:21.620 --> 43:23.220
This is a weird comment

43:23.220 --> 43:28.100
Obviously the summer of 2020 refers to the black lives matter demonstrations and in other contexts

43:28.180 --> 43:31.940
It could be generously understood as violence in response to an indifferent state

43:32.100 --> 43:36.980
That doesn't care about the impact of harsh policing on black communities and won't have that difficult conversation

43:37.220 --> 43:39.780
But in the context of this interview with tucker carlson

43:39.860 --> 43:46.100
It is more like a condemnation of black lives matter for not wanting to talk about their problems instead of resorting to violence

43:46.420 --> 43:51.460
Putting aside the fact that the violence in blm protest has been grossly overstated by the media

43:51.780 --> 43:58.020
The only way someone can assume black people don't want to talk about the violence inflicted upon them by the state is to deliberately ignore that conversation

43:58.260 --> 44:03.860
Which has been happening for a very long time and has been conveniently ignored by people such as professor abbott

44:04.100 --> 44:09.540
It's a great example of how someone like professor abbott was completely ignorant of a problem until it boiled over into a mass movement

44:09.700 --> 44:16.020
And even now his response is that we need to think even less about the negative impact of the social construct of race

44:16.580 --> 44:19.700
This is not the mindset of someone ready for a conversation

44:20.020 --> 44:22.820
Except when it's with tucker carlson in a softball interview

44:23.220 --> 44:27.940
The interview muddles along and I feel like I could spend a whole hour on how so many of these answers are wrapped up

44:27.940 --> 44:31.140
In gentle language but reveal a deep ignorance of the many issues at play

44:31.380 --> 44:35.300
But I want to once again mention how conspiracy theories rear their ugly head

44:35.380 --> 44:40.980
Here's professor abbott talking about who's really behind all this diversity stuff. But the problem is that there's a small group

44:41.700 --> 44:43.700
That's extremely committed

44:44.420 --> 44:46.980
You could call them the woke activist or the social justice

44:47.220 --> 44:51.940
Justice activist and they're willing to spend all their time on this stuff and they sort of steamroll

44:52.260 --> 44:55.380
And there's some kind of twitter mob that organize in this as well

44:56.180 --> 44:58.180
There's there's almost like a playbook

44:58.580 --> 45:01.940
To try to take someone down who disagrees with the ideology

45:02.020 --> 45:05.380
so the first thing that happens is people go on twitter

45:05.940 --> 45:09.380
And they organize and they write lots of messages about the person

45:10.020 --> 45:15.940
And the messages say mean things so they'll say this is racist bigoted white supremacists like very

45:16.420 --> 45:23.780
Scary sounding things the idea that some people have genuine criticisms of him and are simply responding to his words doesn't seem to occur to him

45:23.940 --> 45:27.380
He just waves it away as some kind of conspiracy to advance the fourth rank

45:27.780 --> 45:31.540
This interview isn't strictly about the newsweek article getting some criticism though

45:31.620 --> 45:36.660
Professor abbott is a victim in all of this because he was about to deliver a guest lecture at mit

45:36.980 --> 45:42.900
But was disinvited because of the blowback of that article abbott's response is slightly telling in this interview

45:43.140 --> 45:45.780
Uh only the top people in the field are invited

45:46.180 --> 45:49.300
To do this you give a large public lecture for like 500 people

45:49.780 --> 45:56.660
And then you visit the department at mit about your research about a outreach level of your research

45:56.980 --> 45:58.580
It sounds like this lecture was a big deal

45:58.660 --> 46:00.900
But what is this outreach level comment?

46:01.060 --> 46:05.940
It turns out that this lecture at mit was intended not strictly for faculty or university students

46:06.020 --> 46:08.020
But also for high school students

46:08.420 --> 46:14.660
robert vander hilst head of mit's earth atmospheric and planetary sciences department clarified in a statement

46:14.980 --> 46:18.180
The carlson lecture isn't a scientific talk for fellow scientists

46:18.420 --> 46:24.900
It has a very specific format and public outreach component seeking to build public understanding of climate science and to inspire and engage with

46:24.900 --> 46:30.980
Area high school students. We felt that with the current distractions. We would not be in a position to hold an effective outreach event

46:31.140 --> 46:35.460
I made this decision at my discretion after consulting with faculty and students in the department

46:35.700 --> 46:41.540
And knowing that some might mistake it as an affront on academic freedom a characterization. I do not agree with though

46:41.540 --> 46:48.900
This particular lecture was cancelled mit did invite professor abbott to give another lecture this one instead with faculty and university students

46:49.300 --> 46:53.860
This isn't a case of someone being cancelled. It's a case of someone's lecture being rescheduled

46:54.020 --> 46:57.860
But that's not the narrative we see on tucker carlson's show. It's a way to cripple someone's

46:58.420 --> 47:02.180
A scientific career and put pressure on them not to speak out

47:02.340 --> 47:07.460
I don't know how speaking to high school students would mean more for his career than presenting his research to practicing academics

47:07.780 --> 47:14.020
But there's one more aspect of this interview that was very informative after abbott had that letter written about him in 2020

47:14.100 --> 47:18.340
The minor controversy that followed drew the attention of many supposed free speech groups

47:18.660 --> 47:23.780
Apparently abbott suddenly found himself networking with a number of different groups and individuals ready to champion his cause

47:24.100 --> 47:28.420
That the worst thing that happened to him was a letter didn't matter. They welcomed him into their fold

47:28.740 --> 47:34.420
I was already a part of the heterodox academy. I got involved with fire foundation for individual rights and education

47:34.500 --> 47:39.460
I I met with some of the leadership at acta the american council of trustees and alumni

47:40.020 --> 47:45.140
I started networking and trying to understand what had happened and how I can be effective

47:45.620 --> 47:51.700
He unironically calls this a group of classical liberals and even mentions how they set up a little safe space for themselves

47:51.940 --> 47:53.940
They have controversial speakers

47:54.340 --> 48:00.180
And it's the faculty. It's only faculty who attend by invitation only so everyone can trust who's there

48:00.740 --> 48:02.660
And as is typical with these conversations

48:02.660 --> 48:06.580
We see tucker carlson and professor abbott pat themselves on the back for having a conversation

48:06.900 --> 48:12.820
Even though they might disagree on some stuff and you speaking to me is not the same as ratifying all of my different

48:12.900 --> 48:18.100
Exactly crazy opinions which you may disagree with but that's not the point if you didn't talk to everyone you disagreed with something on

48:18.180 --> 48:19.700
You wouldn't talk to anyone, right?

48:19.700 --> 48:26.180
It's like this program turned into an episode of the ruben report where the hapless dave ruben happily nods along with whatever right-wing

48:26.260 --> 48:28.420
Goal he's invited onto his show only in this case

48:28.500 --> 48:34.260
It's a bit more sophisticated with tucker carlson bringing on a sympathetic face to advance similar talking points

48:34.340 --> 48:40.420
And he's actually capable of marching to the same beat alongside with them instead of vacuously nodding his head like dave ruben

48:40.740 --> 48:45.460
I hate how hollow the whole comment about how they can disagree about things but still talk to one another

48:45.700 --> 48:50.020
At no point in this interview did the two of them have any sort of meaningful disagreement about anything

48:50.180 --> 48:53.940
It's the same line dave ruben would have about not having to agree with all his guests

48:54.100 --> 48:59.460
If there is no active airing of these disagreements in this case tucker carlson doesn't even bring them up

48:59.940 --> 49:06.180
Then this is just platforming ideas with no pushback. The invisible disagreements don't matter because they're not talking about them

49:06.340 --> 49:09.860
These are two people who agree about everything they're discussing in this interview

49:10.100 --> 49:15.300
Their disagreements could be about fundamental policy issues or what kind of potato chip they like to eat

49:15.460 --> 49:17.460
It doesn't matter. We don't see it

49:17.780 --> 49:21.300
Professor abbott not only faced the horror of having his mit lecture rescheduled

49:21.300 --> 49:26.500
He was also rewarded with an additional lecture at princeton, which so far has over 10 000 viewers registered

49:26.580 --> 49:30.020
Which is a lot more than the 500 he expected at his first mit lecture

49:30.180 --> 49:36.020
The interview ends on an optimistic note that really reinforces the idea that this man has in no meaningful way been cancelled

49:36.340 --> 49:40.420
That there is an entire apparatus ready to make him the next darling of the free speech crowd

49:40.580 --> 49:45.220
He might make the rounds on exclusively right-wing shows talking about the left being out of control

49:45.300 --> 49:50.180
And if he plays his car, right maybe he'll get a job at the blaze or maybe we'll never hear about this guy again

49:50.340 --> 49:56.900
Because to be perfectly honest guys like this have limited appeal their tools to talk about the phantom menace of cancel culture

49:56.980 --> 50:00.020
It's really just the media savvy ones who can parlay that into a career

50:00.260 --> 50:02.260
I don't know if this guy has it in him for that

50:02.260 --> 50:05.620
Remember when I said about how I got lucky that tucker took friday off

50:06.020 --> 50:10.980
Well that luck ran out when I learned that he also dropped an extra bit of content onto fox nation

50:10.980 --> 50:18.180
One of his monthly tucker carlson originals this one titled blown away the people versus wind power as you might have guessed

50:18.260 --> 50:25.700
It's about how wind power is a threat to america this 25 minute special which calls itself a documentary is so thin and cheesy

50:25.780 --> 50:27.620
I struggle to take it seriously

50:27.620 --> 50:33.060
It's lavishly produced and leans very heavily on interviews that give emotional context to the supposed threat of wind power

50:33.220 --> 50:35.300
That's the second type of interview. I mentioned above

50:35.780 --> 50:42.420
The vast majority of subjects are either regular people or activists upset that wind turbines have been or are being built near them

50:42.660 --> 50:46.340
Here's an example people who look at some of these wind proposals

50:46.580 --> 50:49.620
Figure out quickly that one of the reasons their community is being targeted

50:49.860 --> 50:52.740
Is it's poor and they're perceived as being desperate for revenue

50:52.820 --> 50:57.220
This sure seems like a case of the little guy being troubled by big business. So let's see who we meet first

50:57.780 --> 51:04.180
The consequence of this affluent nimbyism is that the high cost of green energy falls on poorer places

51:04.420 --> 51:07.860
Places like rural, iowa home to mike and tanya lamb

51:08.340 --> 51:10.500
I'm not sure what property values are like in iowa

51:10.580 --> 51:15.380
But there is no way that anyone living in that home is one of the poorer and desperate described earlier

51:15.780 --> 51:19.300
Tanya lamb who lives in the house literally calls it her dream home

51:19.460 --> 51:20.660
It is our dream home

51:20.660 --> 51:24.660
The special is a collection of shots of windmills breaking up otherwise flat scenery

51:24.660 --> 51:28.100
And if you're guessing many of these complaints about windmills is that they will ruin the view

51:28.580 --> 51:30.580
You'd be right in 2019

51:31.140 --> 51:33.860
The wind farms came this is our view from our dinner table

51:34.820 --> 51:38.980
Turbines every direction and you know, we get a lot of shadow flicker in here, too

51:39.140 --> 51:44.420
I mean just imagine being in a room and someone's turning the light switch on and off on and off on and off

51:44.820 --> 51:49.140
I mean and this it's in the middle of the day. Well, it's actually the morning is when it's the worst and

51:50.020 --> 51:52.020
It I mean it almost makes you dizzy

51:52.020 --> 51:55.860
There are some other assorted complaints like the wind turbine creates a lot of noise

51:56.020 --> 52:02.580
And the only time we hear noise from a turbine is when we get one of these weird close-ups where audio is almost certainly being manipulated

52:02.980 --> 52:04.980
Our peaceful country living

52:06.260 --> 52:11.380
That isn't to say that these things are completely silent and I suppose whatever noise might be generated is annoying

52:11.620 --> 52:13.620
Anyone can find plenty of these complaints online

52:13.700 --> 52:18.900
But a problem with this criticism is that it's couched in the idea that these wind turbines are in rural areas

52:18.980 --> 52:24.340
Because people in cities don't want the burden that comes with building them. That is supposedly the noise they create

52:24.820 --> 52:30.340
As someone who currently lives in a city that is one of the most ridiculous things i've ever heard as I type this

52:30.660 --> 52:34.660
I can hear a plane flying overhead as it approaches the city's airport 30 minutes ago

52:34.660 --> 52:37.380
There was a siren as an ambulance drove by and a few days ago

52:37.460 --> 52:41.700
I spent most of the day listening to a construction crew repair a water main down the street for me

52:42.020 --> 52:45.860
We get noise in the city the occasional whooshing noise would not be a big deal

52:46.260 --> 52:51.380
The reason you don't see a lot of wind turbines in cities is because they're more effective in wide open spaces

52:51.540 --> 52:56.020
Such as coastal areas or open planes if you live somewhere like a flat part of iowa

52:56.100 --> 52:58.420
That's what makes it an attractive spot for a wind turbine

52:58.820 --> 53:02.100
When is it nearly strong enough when the turbine is surrounded by buildings?

53:02.980 --> 53:10.340
We get some laughable complaints about how subsidies are used to create wind farms wind farms only exist because they're heavily subsidized by

53:10.640 --> 53:17.220
Politicians with your money. They wouldn't exist. Otherwise, there's no mention at all of subsidies that go towards fossil fuel companies

53:17.620 --> 53:19.620
This is where the special really drops the ball

53:19.780 --> 53:26.680
Any discussion about energy needs would of course mention that there is always a cost associated with them both financial and environmental

53:27.140 --> 53:29.140
And while wind turbines have one

53:29.200 --> 53:32.420
Comparatively their cost is lower than that of fossil fuels

53:32.660 --> 53:38.900
An article in nature describes the amount of spent on fossil fuel subsidies as more than triple what is spent on renewables like wind energy

53:39.060 --> 53:42.580
It's irresponsible to discuss these subsidies without presenting that context

53:42.740 --> 53:47.860
But it certainly doesn't end there what really annoyed me in the specials when it got personal and tucker tried to use the birds

53:47.940 --> 53:55.060
To push his agenda from the federal government and other studies that show that hundreds of thousands of birds are killed every year

53:55.540 --> 53:59.460
By wind turbines again a comparison needs to be made here every year

53:59.700 --> 54:03.380
Far more birds are killed by power lines buildings and cats than wind turbines

54:03.460 --> 54:07.700
And if we're going to reduce this discussion to energy production fossil fuels are driving climate change

54:07.780 --> 54:14.660
Which will and does have a dramatic impact on bird habitats devastating populations and threatening entire species with extinction

54:15.060 --> 54:18.340
This isn't to say that we shouldn't consider birds when building windmills

54:18.500 --> 54:21.300
Particularly species that are more likely to be impacted by them

54:21.460 --> 54:25.860
And this can be addressed by considering migration patterns and habitats when it comes to placing windmills

54:25.940 --> 54:29.860
But climate change is by far the bigger threat and if someone truly cares about the birds

54:30.020 --> 54:33.300
Fossil fuels are a much greater danger to birds than windmills

54:33.460 --> 54:35.460
There is very little to comment on in this special

54:35.620 --> 54:40.420
We spend some time with a fisherman worried about his business failing because of wind turbines that haven't been built yet

54:40.420 --> 54:46.900
And activists who say that wind turbines would mean new york has changed its political composition this state. It's not a democracy

54:46.980 --> 54:53.380
It's the socialist republic. Oh, it might be fun to just dunk on these people providing evidence that building windmills around water

54:53.540 --> 54:56.500
Typically has no meaningful impact on fish populations

54:56.660 --> 55:01.780
Or when this guy holds up a map to demonstrate that new york state would never build wind turbines near new york city

55:01.940 --> 55:08.100
Is completely contradicted by the fact that there is the empire wind project an offshore wind farm being built right next to new york city

55:08.260 --> 55:10.260
That is planned for completion in 2026

55:10.720 --> 55:14.020
Ultimately, this is the smallest of potatoes being presented

55:14.180 --> 55:21.060
The previous tucker carlson original special to air was about ufos if you're in a series that includes a special about the dangers of ufos

55:21.380 --> 55:22.740
I hate to break it to you

55:22.740 --> 55:24.740
But you're not on a serious program

55:25.060 --> 55:29.300
And so we come to the end of our odyssey through the many programs of tucker carlson

55:29.380 --> 55:35.060
And this was all from a single week what I found most surprising about this venture was how diverse tucker's talking points were

55:35.140 --> 55:39.940
He truly had something for everyone. He had conspiracy theories of all flavors. He had racism

55:40.020 --> 55:44.600
He had sexism transphobia anti-semitism neo-con republicanism and religiosity

55:45.300 --> 55:51.700
Part of my research included trips to the facebook page for tucker carlson tonight where clips of the opening monologues were often shared

55:51.780 --> 55:53.780
And the comments were completely uninteresting

55:54.180 --> 55:59.060
Some I guess i'll call them highlights include if we the people want to keep our freedom

55:59.300 --> 56:01.780
We must stand up and not submit to the mandates

56:02.100 --> 56:03.300
We must push back

56:03.300 --> 56:08.420
We must ask the one and only true god to have mercy on us and shine the light of truth on the evil

56:08.420 --> 56:13.540
Being played out right in front of us. No wonder the left hates tucker carlson. He mops the floor with them

56:14.340 --> 56:16.340
every single night

56:16.820 --> 56:18.580
With the exception of the colon pal monologue

56:18.580 --> 56:23.380
Which sparked a bit of debate between those who respect his position and those who hate his disapproval of donald trump

56:23.460 --> 56:27.140
The comments are mostly filled with screeds against democrats and adulation for tucker

56:27.380 --> 56:30.820
No one is watching the show critically. They're coming here to have their biases served

56:31.380 --> 56:36.340
This observation I imagine will shock no one nor will my debunking of tucker carlson's content

56:36.500 --> 56:40.580
His program has long been understood as a pack of lies used to push far-right talking points

56:40.660 --> 56:46.420
But by washing it for a week what surprised me was how artificial it all felt so obviously rehearsed. Here's a quick example

56:46.660 --> 56:51.140
Like white privilege family privilege is an unacknowledged and unearned benefit

56:52.800 --> 56:54.900
Instantiated if that's even a word these people are so stupid

56:54.900 --> 57:01.940
Instantiated in u.s. Law's policies and practices just right like an american for the benefit of tucker according to oxford

57:02.640 --> 57:08.900
Instantiated means to represent as or by an instance. It's a little examples like these that exemplify or

57:09.680 --> 57:16.100
Instantiate the somewhat folksy attitude tucker presents on a show much like the rolled up sleeves and wood paneling on his today program

57:16.180 --> 57:19.620
Or the photo ops he does in his definitely real and not at all staged

57:19.620 --> 57:25.540
Cabinsque room tucker carlson's audience have bought into this fiction of him being a man of the people even though he comes from

57:25.540 --> 57:28.260
A wealthy background and continues to make millions on fox news

57:28.420 --> 57:32.340
pushing hollow narratives designed to misinform and distract his audience from the fact that he

57:32.500 --> 57:35.540
And people like him are actively working against their interests

57:35.700 --> 57:39.860
It speaks to the problem of personalities in political commentary people aren't tuning in for the news

57:39.940 --> 57:41.460
They're tuning in to see tucker

57:41.460 --> 57:45.140
He gives them a version of the world they want to believe in so they outsource their thinking to him

57:45.140 --> 57:48.340
And he shapes the news of the day into a version that confirms their biases

57:48.660 --> 57:55.060
Whether it's distracting them with bogus stories about menacing refugee children or misinforming them about vaccines that will save their lives

57:55.220 --> 58:01.060
The objective is to rile people up and make them angry with empty narratives and then direct them towards republican politicians

58:01.140 --> 58:05.940
Will devote more money to the military and undermine projects that might benefit the american people

58:06.420 --> 58:12.260
The interview with retcord bragman summed it up perfectly when he called tucker carlson a millionaire working for billionaires

58:12.420 --> 58:18.340
And that is why that segment never saw the light of day on tucker's show and we only have evidence since bragman recorded it himself

58:18.660 --> 58:23.780
Tucker carlson needs that facade to keep this whole thing going. It's not about standing up to the powerful elites

58:23.860 --> 58:28.020
It's about distracting the people with nonsense so they don't notice those same elites exploiting them

58:28.340 --> 58:31.720
That is what tucker carlson does with his programming each week

58:34.740 --> 58:39.300
This one was quite a ride tucker carlson's show really spins your head around

58:39.620 --> 58:44.980
Just constantly firing off information at you daring you to even try and understand it

58:45.140 --> 58:50.020
If I wanted to debunk every claim he made on his show this video would have been like five or six hours

58:50.340 --> 58:56.900
It's the eternal problem of debunking videos where the truth takes so much longer to explain than the lie that is repeated so easily

58:57.380 --> 59:00.260
