1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,080
Have you ever found yourself watching a YouTube political commentary channel, heard them cite

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,080
something and then checked the source yourself and found that it said something completely different?

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,880
It happens all the time in the videos I respond to and I often wonder what goes through the mind

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,280
of someone as they read this stuff. Do they have an agenda they're trying to push by distorting

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,800
the truth or are they just not bright enough to understand what they're reading? And that brings

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,320
us to Tim Poole. Poole styles himself a journalist and while I'm not terribly familiar with the

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:39,040
thousands of videos he's released, I'm going to violate his recommendation and focus on one video

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,880
where he gives us a lovely example of how to read an article and twist it into a narrative.

9
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:54,320
The title to his video, Vox Thinks Men Don't Deserve Civil Rights, reminds me of an old adage

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,080
when it comes to journalism. If a headline ends with a question mark, the answer is usually no.

11
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:05,920
Poole is responding to an article from Vox titled, A Men's Rights Activist Sued a Women's Beer Event,

12
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,520
written by Rebecca James. Now let's see why this video got 122,000 views at the time of me writing

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,800
this. I don't even know how to describe this, okay? This has got to be the most ignorant piece

14
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,560
of writing I have ever seen. It's actually rather terrifying and bigoted. So we're off to a great

15
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,520
start. Poole is letting us know that this article in Vox is the most ignorant piece of writing he's

16
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,520
ever seen. This is actually a good opener, not because it's true of course, but because it's

17
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,800
still specific to the article itself and doesn't pretend that this article is some kind of rosetta

18
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,040
stone for the left. At least it doesn't do that yet. The first couple of minutes is just Poole

19
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,440
blandly reading the article, which hardly matters because it's the commentary where

20
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:56,160
the distortion happens. Let's look at how he interprets one slightly ambiguous line.

21
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:03,600
Men's rights activists believe that society is actually sexist against men. Full stop. Not

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:11,440
necessarily. It's my understanding that, you know, by putting actually sexist against men,

23
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,040
they're kind of implying that they don't believe it's sexist against women.

24
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,480
Wait, how does he know that? This line, men's rights activists believe that society is actually

25
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:29,760
sexist against men. Anything regarding women here is being completely inferred by Poole. His phrasing,

26
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,480
they're kind of implying, gives him permission to launch into a rant about a straw man of his own

27
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,080
making. Poole's perceived idea that Jennings, the author of the article, believes men's rights

28
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,200
activists don't believe society is sexist towards women. Maybe she does think that, but there's

29
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,800
nothing in the article so far to suggest that, except for Poole's bias. Society is actually

30
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:57,920
only sexist against men. The word only doesn't appear there. This is a single line in an article,

31
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,080
and some more context can help us shed some light on what the author is trying to say.

32
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,520
Context like this. Fry has perfected the subculture's favorite way to target what they

33
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:12,160
see as a society that's sexist against men, suing businesses and organizations that incentivize

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:17,600
women to go there. Jennings is telling us that men's rights activists, Martin Fry specifically,

35
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:25,200
see society as sexist against men. Once again, no mention of women. This is why reading an article

36
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,560
line by line is often a recipe for disaster, taking time to understand context matters.

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
But if you're trying to push a narrative, you might be more inclined to imagine what the author

38
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,280
thinks, rather than engaging with what they're actually saying. If you are running a public

39
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,120
business, and you are using public infrastructure, I am of the opinion you must serve members of the

40
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,880
public within reason. There's nuance, right? There's certain grounds in which you can remove

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,120
certain people. I don't think it's absolute, but for the most part, if someone wants to come to your

42
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,080
event, you can't be like, no dudes allowed, because that would be a violation of civil rights law.

43
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,280
I think so. Right. Okay, let's go back to the article and have Tim read it out for us.

44
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,960
But in November 2017, as Sue tells Eater, a man emailed Eagle Rock's general information

45
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,760
line asking for a spot at the ticketed forum. A staff member mistakenly told the man

46
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,120
that the event was for women only. In fact, men have attended before. And even after he was offered

47
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,440
access to a future women's beer event, the man ultimately filed a discrimination claim through

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,520
the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the entity in charge of enforcing California civil

49
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,800
rights laws. What did he say again? You can't be like, no dudes allowed. So someone on staff

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,240
at this bar mistakenly tells someone that men aren't allowed when men have attended this event

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,160
several times in the past. And the person was offered a spot in the future. This is grounds for

52
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,600
a civil rights lawsuit. Really, this turns into a little rant. But I would be surprised if Vox

53
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,560
isn't supporting the you know, the gay couple that wanted the wedding cake. Basically, the wedding

54
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,040
cake story is a gay couple wanted a custom wedding cake. The proprietor said you can buy any one of

55
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,120
these cakes, but I won't do a custom job for your wedding. So they sued. And the left is upset about

56
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,920
it. And the right is defending the private business rights. Well, what about this? This is a

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,920
mushy mouth gotcha game trying to catch Fox on some kind of hypocrisy charge. I could play the

58
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:25,920
same game pool is playing. I could make a whole video asking why the right is so anxious to defend

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,760
a cake shop refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple, but is silent on a bar supposedly refusing

60
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:36,720
service to men at a special event for women. Although I'd still be a liar making that video

61
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,160
because the women's night doesn't ban men from attending something Tim Poole never figures out

62
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,280
because it's not actually about civil rights. It's not about principle. It's about just winning,

63
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,040
right? So the left is on the side of certain groups. All they want is for them to win. They

64
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,080
don't care about the principle. Holy shit. One article on box is suddenly standing in for

65
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,640
the left. Does Jennings realize how important she is now? She is the voice of the left. But obviously

66
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:10,560
Poole here is using his reading of this specific article for commentary about the left. This is his

67
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,320
exemplar and this is the point we've safely left the realm of criticizing a specific article

68
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:21,600
and we're now talking about a group of people. So a quick sketch of what we've seen so far.

69
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,160
Poole is reading this article with a bit of creative license using it to inform a certain branch of

70
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,080
commentary and now he's taking that commentary and placing it all on the shoulders of the left.

71
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:39,840
I hope the game being played here is becoming more obvious. Here's some more bad reading.

72
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,400
And as she told Eater, she wants to elicit some form of change at the legislative level

73
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:50,560
to minimize the exploitation of the UNRWA Act, a California law against discrimination by sex,

74
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,600
race, and other factors, by career plaintiffs so that small businesses and women's groups don't

75
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:01,440
continually get targeted for these cases. Career plaintiffs. Man, I love the absolute bias here.

76
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,080
Let's call the man an activist. They've called him a men's rights activist. Why call him a career

77
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,680
plaintiff? He's clearly doing this to make a point and he's using the law as it is written.

78
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,400
It is not an exploitation of the law to make sure businesses are upholding the law. That's your

79
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,200
issue. So did anyone catch the mistake Poole made here? This video, I thought, was about the bias in

80
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:29,120
Vox's article as it was written by Jennings with Vox and by extension Jennings being responsible

81
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:35,280
for the extreme bias. But what he just read here isn't written by Jennings. It's a quote from

82
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,480
Ting Tzu, the woman who ran the women's beer forum. Generally speaking, you shouldn't assume that

83
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:46,480
someone reporting on a story agrees with everything or even most of what a subject is saying.

84
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:51,200
Poole even acknowledges Fry is called an activist earlier in the article, which should have given

85
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,960
him a hint as to what was going on here. A bigger hint than the fucking quotation marks.

86
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:03,120
I want to take the bait for a moment. Where does Tzu get off calling Fry a career plaintiff?

87
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:09,120
This article from KCAL Los Angeles from 2014 describes Fry in another lawsuit where he was

88
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:16,000
doing some real activism suing Cha Cha's Latin Kitchen restaurant in Brea in July 2013 claiming

89
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,800
he was denied the opportunity to order the same Ladies Night special discount items that were

90
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,880
offered to female patrons during visits to the restaurant in January and May 2013. What a hero.

91
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,600
He lost this suit but according to court records Fry has filed over 40 sex discrimination lawsuits

92
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,160
and this was back in 2014 and we know that number has gone up by at least one

93
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:43,680
as per the article we're talking about right now. This is the clear behavior of someone looking

94
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,000
for these lawsuits using the law to pressure businesses to get rid of promotions that he

95
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,680
considers violations of his rights and I stress that these are what he considers violations of

96
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,360
his rights as he's lost a number of these lawsuits that have gone to trial. Though generally a lot of

97
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,120
them settle outside of court because the businesses he targets can't afford to fight back. That's the

98
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,720
grift the Jennings article is trying to describe. If this went to court the law could be tested and

99
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:16,960
as we've seen in the past Fry has lost several of his claims. Why Tim Poole thinks he is a credible

100
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:22,000
activist I'm not too sure. I guess he probably just hasn't read up on the subject outside of a

101
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,680
Vox article he can yell at and paint as extreme leftist propaganda. It's easy to call something

102
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:34,800
propaganda or extreme leftist bigative whatever when you don't read beyond that article or even

103
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:41,600
read the article accurately. As a side note I'd like to mention that all these lawsuits filed by

104
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,960
Fry really highlight the absurdity of the legal system where important questions of rights can

105
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,800
only be settled by those who can afford lawyers. We're getting to some good stuff now. The

106
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:59,440
weaponization of the law against the very philosophy that one claims to champion is a case study in

107
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:06,000
irony. For MRAs it's able-bodied white cis heterosexual men using civil rights legislation

108
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,960
which is enacted to walk back the country's history of viewing the rights of able-bodied

109
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:16,240
cis white heterosexual men as more important than others. No it's not! That's literally not

110
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,760
why we have civil rights laws. Civil rights law isn't written to say white men have too much power.

111
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:27,200
Civil rights law is written to say that any person is is deserving of rights.

112
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:33,440
Ooh he gets so angry here. I like this little clip not because it's funny seeing him get angry

113
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:39,200
but because it encapsulates an incredibly dopey reading of history and some painful pedantry.

114
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,880
The why we have civil rights laws is what I want to focus on here. Civil rights laws were not

115
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:50,800
written to be anti-white men obviously right but the context in which they were written was

116
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,600
specifically designed to protect the rights of individuals who are not able-bodied white cis

117
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,200
heterosexual men because those were the people who had the most rights in American society before

118
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,040
they were written. As a point of comparison let's take a famous example the 19th amendment to the

119
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,040
United States Constitution. It reads pretty simply as the rights of citizens of the United States

120
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:19,360
to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.

121
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,320
That sounds like it was written to protect all sexes right? But why was it written in the first

122
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:30,000
place? I would hope people would know that it was written because women were being denied the right

123
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:36,640
to vote. To say that this amendment was written to protect men and women is true only in the most

124
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:42,240
pedantic sense. The historical reality of that amendment is that it was written to protect the

125
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,560
rights of women. Let's look at the quoted section again from the Jennings article.

126
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,480
Civil rights legislation which is enacted to walk back the country's history of viewing the rights

127
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:59,120
of able-bodied white cis heterosexual men as more important than others. Maybe the is

128
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:06,480
should have been a was here if we're going to be particular about grammar since enacted is the past

129
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:13,520
but the walk back the country's history part is pretty explicit in that this sentence is about

130
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,760
why these laws were created to correct the racist and sexist differences in American society present

131
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,360
in its founding. If you don't believe the US was racist and sexist when it started then

132
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:32,640
I don't know man women not being able to vote in slavery seem pretty sexist and racist to me.

133
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:36,800
And the irony this paragraph by Jennings is pointing out is that Fry is using civil

134
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,760
rights legislation to shut down a space where women have historically been underrepresented.

135
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,960
To focus on a pedantic reading of the law is to completely miss the point of what Jennings is

136
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:53,120
writing here. It says as much in the one paragraph that Poole didn't even touch in his reading.

137
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,240
When the law is set up to protect all people regardless of their demographic,

138
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,440
these kinds of bad faith actors are able to twist laws designed to help correct imbalances

139
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:09,840
to try to undermine their existence. That is to say when people abuse the law in this way,

140
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:15,600
bad faith actors like Martin Fry, it undermines the reason these laws were created in the first

141
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:22,880
place. Someone like Fry isn't really striving for equality so much as he is trying to make sure that

142
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,040
white men don't lose a single ounce of their privilege. And that includes apparently having

143
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,800
access to discounts. Poole's reading here is divorced from history in that he sees these laws

144
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:41,120
in a modern context as a neutral tool for anyone who meets their definition. While it's well and

145
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:46,000
good to write laws like these neutrally, I suspect when civil rights laws were written to get people

146
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,760
to take whites only signs down they weren't worried about a day when men would be denied a

147
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:59,680
25% discount on a green fee. And yeah that's one of the fights Martin Fry fought for. He was very

148
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,000
upset there was a 25% discount for women during Breast Cancer Awareness Month at a golf course.

149
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,800
Like I said, the guy's a hero. And invert it. It would be perfect in the 1950s. Women are suing

150
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,320
men under civil rights law. They're exploiting the law to gain access. That's literally not what

151
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:23,920
civil rights are about. Another lovely take. Are men really as disadvantaged today as women were in

152
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:31,120
the 1950s? Really? There's a level of nuance here he just isn't engaging with because it isn't really

153
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,560
convenient to his narrative that he's pushing. Like take a philosophy course. Just read some

154
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:43,120
philosophy and and some famous writers on liberty and freedom and what it really means because this

155
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,160
is some of the most insane bigoted racist nonsense I've ever seen. Oh my god. Man this guy must not

156
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,240
see much if this is the most bigoted stuff he's ever seen. Also how is this racist? Wasn't this

157
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:03,920
about sexism? Does Tim Poole think this video is about race just because she's Asian? Obviously I'm

158
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:09,040
just being silly here. He clearly misspoke. I fully recognize that it's a dick move to ignore

159
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,440
the context of a person's words to create a straw man to further a political narrative.

160
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,840
If only we were both playing by those rules. Before leaving the video entirely, here are the

161
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:24,640
most telling clips. And again that's about all I really know because I don't follow this a whole

162
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:31,200
lot but I will say when I'm look I don't follow Vox uh I read Vox pretty often but I don't know

163
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:36,080
their exact opinion on the on the wedding cake thing. Personally I don't know the full details

164
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,960
of Jordan Peterson's uh suits. In each of those clips Tim Poole is admitting he doesn't know

165
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:47,920
many details of what he's commenting on and then proceeds to comment on it. Funnily enough he knows

166
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:53,600
less than he realizes from why civil rights laws exist to the nature of the event this article is

167
00:15:53,600 --> 00:16:00,000
describing but he doesn't stop himself from commenting on any of it. And this is what annoys

168
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:06,320
me. Unlike Poole I won't make any broader claims about my subject based on one video. I sampled a

169
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:12,000
few more of his videos but not nearly enough to form an opinion on the guy because the few I

170
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,520
actually sat down and watched made me stand up for my computer and and consider the terrible

171
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:23,120
choices I've made. Tim Poole's video has an argument that Vox, a stand-in for the left,

172
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,280
constantly pushes out sexist pieces on their website. Poole's strategy to prove this hypothesis

173
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,960
is to focus on a single video contorting it to fit his premise and then providing it as evidence

174
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,600
for his narrative. Maybe if I comb through his thousands of videos maybe I could find some

175
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,640
actual evidence of this narrative existing and his point could have some merit. But even if he does

176
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:51,600
have videos where he provides evidence that Vox is some kind of horribly sexist outlet this isn't

177
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,720
one of them. This is just Tim Poole beating his audience a narrative.
