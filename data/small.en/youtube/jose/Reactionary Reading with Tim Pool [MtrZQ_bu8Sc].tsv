0	6080	Have you ever found yourself watching a YouTube political commentary channel, heard them cite
6080	12080	something and then checked the source yourself and found that it said something completely different?
12080	16880	It happens all the time in the videos I respond to and I often wonder what goes through the mind
16880	21280	of someone as they read this stuff. Do they have an agenda they're trying to push by distorting
21280	26800	the truth or are they just not bright enough to understand what they're reading? And that brings
26880	32320	us to Tim Poole. Poole styles himself a journalist and while I'm not terribly familiar with the
32320	39040	thousands of videos he's released, I'm going to violate his recommendation and focus on one video
39040	44880	where he gives us a lovely example of how to read an article and twist it into a narrative.
46640	54320	The title to his video, Vox Thinks Men Don't Deserve Civil Rights, reminds me of an old adage
54320	60080	when it comes to journalism. If a headline ends with a question mark, the answer is usually no.
60080	65920	Poole is responding to an article from Vox titled, A Men's Rights Activist Sued a Women's Beer Event,
65920	73520	written by Rebecca James. Now let's see why this video got 122,000 views at the time of me writing
73520	78800	this. I don't even know how to describe this, okay? This has got to be the most ignorant piece
78800	84560	of writing I have ever seen. It's actually rather terrifying and bigoted. So we're off to a great
84560	89520	start. Poole is letting us know that this article in Vox is the most ignorant piece of writing he's
89520	95520	ever seen. This is actually a good opener, not because it's true of course, but because it's
95520	100800	still specific to the article itself and doesn't pretend that this article is some kind of rosetta
100800	107040	stone for the left. At least it doesn't do that yet. The first couple of minutes is just Poole
107040	111440	blandly reading the article, which hardly matters because it's the commentary where
111440	116160	the distortion happens. Let's look at how he interprets one slightly ambiguous line.
117120	123600	Men's rights activists believe that society is actually sexist against men. Full stop. Not
123600	131440	necessarily. It's my understanding that, you know, by putting actually sexist against men,
131440	135040	they're kind of implying that they don't believe it's sexist against women.
135840	142480	Wait, how does he know that? This line, men's rights activists believe that society is actually
142560	149760	sexist against men. Anything regarding women here is being completely inferred by Poole. His phrasing,
149760	154480	they're kind of implying, gives him permission to launch into a rant about a straw man of his own
154480	160080	making. Poole's perceived idea that Jennings, the author of the article, believes men's rights
160080	165200	activists don't believe society is sexist towards women. Maybe she does think that, but there's
165200	170800	nothing in the article so far to suggest that, except for Poole's bias. Society is actually
170800	177920	only sexist against men. The word only doesn't appear there. This is a single line in an article,
177920	182080	and some more context can help us shed some light on what the author is trying to say.
182640	187520	Context like this. Fry has perfected the subculture's favorite way to target what they
187520	192160	see as a society that's sexist against men, suing businesses and organizations that incentivize
192160	197600	women to go there. Jennings is telling us that men's rights activists, Martin Fry specifically,
197600	205200	see society as sexist against men. Once again, no mention of women. This is why reading an article
205200	210560	line by line is often a recipe for disaster, taking time to understand context matters.
210560	215120	But if you're trying to push a narrative, you might be more inclined to imagine what the author
215120	221280	thinks, rather than engaging with what they're actually saying. If you are running a public
221280	227120	business, and you are using public infrastructure, I am of the opinion you must serve members of the
227120	230880	public within reason. There's nuance, right? There's certain grounds in which you can remove
230880	235120	certain people. I don't think it's absolute, but for the most part, if someone wants to come to your
235120	240080	event, you can't be like, no dudes allowed, because that would be a violation of civil rights law.
240080	245280	I think so. Right. Okay, let's go back to the article and have Tim read it out for us.
246240	250960	But in November 2017, as Sue tells Eater, a man emailed Eagle Rock's general information
250960	255760	line asking for a spot at the ticketed forum. A staff member mistakenly told the man
255840	261120	that the event was for women only. In fact, men have attended before. And even after he was offered
261120	265440	access to a future women's beer event, the man ultimately filed a discrimination claim through
265440	269520	the Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the entity in charge of enforcing California civil
269520	276800	rights laws. What did he say again? You can't be like, no dudes allowed. So someone on staff
276800	282240	at this bar mistakenly tells someone that men aren't allowed when men have attended this event
282240	288160	several times in the past. And the person was offered a spot in the future. This is grounds for
288160	295600	a civil rights lawsuit. Really, this turns into a little rant. But I would be surprised if Vox
295600	300560	isn't supporting the you know, the gay couple that wanted the wedding cake. Basically, the wedding
300560	305040	cake story is a gay couple wanted a custom wedding cake. The proprietor said you can buy any one of
305040	309120	these cakes, but I won't do a custom job for your wedding. So they sued. And the left is upset about
309120	313920	it. And the right is defending the private business rights. Well, what about this? This is a
313920	319920	mushy mouth gotcha game trying to catch Fox on some kind of hypocrisy charge. I could play the
319920	325920	same game pool is playing. I could make a whole video asking why the right is so anxious to defend
325920	331760	a cake shop refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple, but is silent on a bar supposedly refusing
331760	336720	service to men at a special event for women. Although I'd still be a liar making that video
336720	342160	because the women's night doesn't ban men from attending something Tim Poole never figures out
342160	347280	because it's not actually about civil rights. It's not about principle. It's about just winning,
347280	353040	right? So the left is on the side of certain groups. All they want is for them to win. They
353040	358080	don't care about the principle. Holy shit. One article on box is suddenly standing in for
358080	364640	the left. Does Jennings realize how important she is now? She is the voice of the left. But obviously
364640	370560	Poole here is using his reading of this specific article for commentary about the left. This is his
370560	376320	exemplar and this is the point we've safely left the realm of criticizing a specific article
376320	381600	and we're now talking about a group of people. So a quick sketch of what we've seen so far.
381600	388160	Poole is reading this article with a bit of creative license using it to inform a certain branch of
388160	394080	commentary and now he's taking that commentary and placing it all on the shoulders of the left.
394080	399840	I hope the game being played here is becoming more obvious. Here's some more bad reading.
399840	404400	And as she told Eater, she wants to elicit some form of change at the legislative level
404400	410560	to minimize the exploitation of the UNRWA Act, a California law against discrimination by sex,
410560	415600	race, and other factors, by career plaintiffs so that small businesses and women's groups don't
415600	421440	continually get targeted for these cases. Career plaintiffs. Man, I love the absolute bias here.
421440	426080	Let's call the man an activist. They've called him a men's rights activist. Why call him a career
426080	431680	plaintiff? He's clearly doing this to make a point and he's using the law as it is written.
431680	436400	It is not an exploitation of the law to make sure businesses are upholding the law. That's your
436400	443200	issue. So did anyone catch the mistake Poole made here? This video, I thought, was about the bias in
443200	449120	Vox's article as it was written by Jennings with Vox and by extension Jennings being responsible
449120	455280	for the extreme bias. But what he just read here isn't written by Jennings. It's a quote from
455280	460480	Ting Tzu, the woman who ran the women's beer forum. Generally speaking, you shouldn't assume that
460480	466480	someone reporting on a story agrees with everything or even most of what a subject is saying.
466480	471200	Poole even acknowledges Fry is called an activist earlier in the article, which should have given
471200	476960	him a hint as to what was going on here. A bigger hint than the fucking quotation marks.
477600	483120	I want to take the bait for a moment. Where does Tzu get off calling Fry a career plaintiff?
483120	489120	This article from KCAL Los Angeles from 2014 describes Fry in another lawsuit where he was
489120	496000	doing some real activism suing Cha Cha's Latin Kitchen restaurant in Brea in July 2013 claiming
496000	500800	he was denied the opportunity to order the same Ladies Night special discount items that were
500800	506880	offered to female patrons during visits to the restaurant in January and May 2013. What a hero.
507520	513600	He lost this suit but according to court records Fry has filed over 40 sex discrimination lawsuits
513600	518160	and this was back in 2014 and we know that number has gone up by at least one
518160	523680	as per the article we're talking about right now. This is the clear behavior of someone looking
523680	528000	for these lawsuits using the law to pressure businesses to get rid of promotions that he
528000	533680	considers violations of his rights and I stress that these are what he considers violations of
533680	539360	his rights as he's lost a number of these lawsuits that have gone to trial. Though generally a lot of
539360	545120	them settle outside of court because the businesses he targets can't afford to fight back. That's the
545120	550720	grift the Jennings article is trying to describe. If this went to court the law could be tested and
550720	556960	as we've seen in the past Fry has lost several of his claims. Why Tim Poole thinks he is a credible
556960	562000	activist I'm not too sure. I guess he probably just hasn't read up on the subject outside of a
562000	567680	Vox article he can yell at and paint as extreme leftist propaganda. It's easy to call something
567680	574800	propaganda or extreme leftist bigative whatever when you don't read beyond that article or even
574800	581600	read the article accurately. As a side note I'd like to mention that all these lawsuits filed by
581600	586960	Fry really highlight the absurdity of the legal system where important questions of rights can
586960	592800	only be settled by those who can afford lawyers. We're getting to some good stuff now. The
592800	599440	weaponization of the law against the very philosophy that one claims to champion is a case study in
599440	606000	irony. For MRAs it's able-bodied white cis heterosexual men using civil rights legislation
606000	610960	which is enacted to walk back the country's history of viewing the rights of able-bodied
610960	616240	cis white heterosexual men as more important than others. No it's not! That's literally not
616240	621760	why we have civil rights laws. Civil rights law isn't written to say white men have too much power.
621760	627200	Civil rights law is written to say that any person is is deserving of rights.
628000	633440	Ooh he gets so angry here. I like this little clip not because it's funny seeing him get angry
633440	639200	but because it encapsulates an incredibly dopey reading of history and some painful pedantry.
639200	644880	The why we have civil rights laws is what I want to focus on here. Civil rights laws were not
644880	650800	written to be anti-white men obviously right but the context in which they were written was
650800	655600	specifically designed to protect the rights of individuals who are not able-bodied white cis
655600	661200	heterosexual men because those were the people who had the most rights in American society before
661200	667040	they were written. As a point of comparison let's take a famous example the 19th amendment to the
667040	673040	United States Constitution. It reads pretty simply as the rights of citizens of the United States
673040	679360	to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex.
679360	684320	That sounds like it was written to protect all sexes right? But why was it written in the first
684320	690000	place? I would hope people would know that it was written because women were being denied the right
690000	696640	to vote. To say that this amendment was written to protect men and women is true only in the most
696640	702240	pedantic sense. The historical reality of that amendment is that it was written to protect the
702240	706560	rights of women. Let's look at the quoted section again from the Jennings article.
707120	712480	Civil rights legislation which is enacted to walk back the country's history of viewing the rights
712480	719120	of able-bodied white cis heterosexual men as more important than others. Maybe the is
719680	726480	should have been a was here if we're going to be particular about grammar since enacted is the past
727120	733520	but the walk back the country's history part is pretty explicit in that this sentence is about
733520	739760	why these laws were created to correct the racist and sexist differences in American society present
739760	745360	in its founding. If you don't believe the US was racist and sexist when it started then
747280	752640	I don't know man women not being able to vote in slavery seem pretty sexist and racist to me.
752640	756800	And the irony this paragraph by Jennings is pointing out is that Fry is using civil
756800	761760	rights legislation to shut down a space where women have historically been underrepresented.
761760	766960	To focus on a pedantic reading of the law is to completely miss the point of what Jennings is
766960	773120	writing here. It says as much in the one paragraph that Poole didn't even touch in his reading.
774000	778240	When the law is set up to protect all people regardless of their demographic,
778240	783440	these kinds of bad faith actors are able to twist laws designed to help correct imbalances
783440	789840	to try to undermine their existence. That is to say when people abuse the law in this way,
789840	795600	bad faith actors like Martin Fry, it undermines the reason these laws were created in the first
795600	802880	place. Someone like Fry isn't really striving for equality so much as he is trying to make sure that
802880	809040	white men don't lose a single ounce of their privilege. And that includes apparently having
809040	814800	access to discounts. Poole's reading here is divorced from history in that he sees these laws
814800	821120	in a modern context as a neutral tool for anyone who meets their definition. While it's well and
821120	826000	good to write laws like these neutrally, I suspect when civil rights laws were written to get people
826000	831760	to take whites only signs down they weren't worried about a day when men would be denied a
831760	839680	25% discount on a green fee. And yeah that's one of the fights Martin Fry fought for. He was very
839680	846000	upset there was a 25% discount for women during Breast Cancer Awareness Month at a golf course.
846000	852800	Like I said, the guy's a hero. And invert it. It would be perfect in the 1950s. Women are suing
852800	858320	men under civil rights law. They're exploiting the law to gain access. That's literally not what
858320	863920	civil rights are about. Another lovely take. Are men really as disadvantaged today as women were in
863920	871120	the 1950s? Really? There's a level of nuance here he just isn't engaging with because it isn't really
871120	876560	convenient to his narrative that he's pushing. Like take a philosophy course. Just read some
876560	883120	philosophy and and some famous writers on liberty and freedom and what it really means because this
883120	890160	is some of the most insane bigoted racist nonsense I've ever seen. Oh my god. Man this guy must not
890160	896240	see much if this is the most bigoted stuff he's ever seen. Also how is this racist? Wasn't this
896240	903920	about sexism? Does Tim Poole think this video is about race just because she's Asian? Obviously I'm
903920	909040	just being silly here. He clearly misspoke. I fully recognize that it's a dick move to ignore
909040	913440	the context of a person's words to create a straw man to further a political narrative.
914240	919840	If only we were both playing by those rules. Before leaving the video entirely, here are the
919840	924640	most telling clips. And again that's about all I really know because I don't follow this a whole
924640	931200	lot but I will say when I'm look I don't follow Vox uh I read Vox pretty often but I don't know
931200	936080	their exact opinion on the on the wedding cake thing. Personally I don't know the full details
936160	940960	of Jordan Peterson's uh suits. In each of those clips Tim Poole is admitting he doesn't know
940960	947920	many details of what he's commenting on and then proceeds to comment on it. Funnily enough he knows
947920	953600	less than he realizes from why civil rights laws exist to the nature of the event this article is
953600	960000	describing but he doesn't stop himself from commenting on any of it. And this is what annoys
960880	966320	me. Unlike Poole I won't make any broader claims about my subject based on one video. I sampled a
966320	972000	few more of his videos but not nearly enough to form an opinion on the guy because the few I
972000	977520	actually sat down and watched made me stand up for my computer and and consider the terrible
977520	983120	choices I've made. Tim Poole's video has an argument that Vox, a stand-in for the left,
983120	989280	constantly pushes out sexist pieces on their website. Poole's strategy to prove this hypothesis
989280	994960	is to focus on a single video contorting it to fit his premise and then providing it as evidence
994960	999600	for his narrative. Maybe if I comb through his thousands of videos maybe I could find some
999600	1004640	actual evidence of this narrative existing and his point could have some merit. But even if he does
1004640	1011600	have videos where he provides evidence that Vox is some kind of horribly sexist outlet this isn't
1011600	1016720	one of them. This is just Tim Poole beating his audience a narrative.
