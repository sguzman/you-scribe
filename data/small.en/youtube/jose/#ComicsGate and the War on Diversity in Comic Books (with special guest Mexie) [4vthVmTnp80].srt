1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Have you ever read a comic where the hero fought an evil corporation or tyrannical government?

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:13,040
Some might call storylines like these or images like these ones a subtle political statement.

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,360
But others, however, can't or choose not to see any politics here.

4
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,680
These are just colorful images of adventures unconnected to the world of politics.

5
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:27,240
And if they start to see politics, that must be the product of some kind of sinister agenda

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,880
to push the creator's beliefs onto people.

7
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:36,160
The only politics in their mind that should be in comics are bland, centrist, mainstream

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,160
opinions.

9
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,800
Nothing that could be considered objectionable or outside the norm.

10
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,680
Or at least, the norm is they see it.

11
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:50,140
This crowd of complainers, which spawned movements such as Game or Gate, typically parade the

12
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:53,440
mantra of having politics shove down their throat.

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,880
And politics, in their mind, often includes diverse characters and the hiring of diverse

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,640
characters, all to push a sinister progressive agenda.

15
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,880
If the complaint is that the stories are bad, why not complain about the writing instead

16
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:09,560
of the diversity?

17
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,240
Maybe the problem really is because some people just don't like seeing diversity in their

18
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,840
comics.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,240
Comics can be many things, from edgy underground political commentary to touching melodrama

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,120
about the trials of growing up in a man's world.

21
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,840
For the purposes of this video, though, we're going to be looking exclusively at the genre

22
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,720
synonymous with comic books, and that's superheroes.

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,680
That all started with Action Comics number one, the first appearance of Superman.

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,920
In the coming decades, he would be followed by Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America,

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,720
The Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, Wolverine, and some other characters you may have heard

26
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
of.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,720
And probably way, way more you haven't.

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,880
You may have noticed one thing most of these characters have in common.

29
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,960
The majority of them are men, and most of them are white.

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:04,840
From the 1930s to the 1960s, the US was a very white place, and superhero comics were

31
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,160
typically read by young boys.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,600
Publishers knew that these young boys enjoyed reading characters that looked like them.

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,520
Publishers also liked money, so that's who they sold their books to.

34
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:20,000
So this wasn't exactly a nefarious plot, but rather the blind prejudice of capitalism

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
that gave us all these white guy characters.

36
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,880
And the few times minorities were included, we'd get, ugh, things like this.

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:32,880
While many characters were forgotten, thankfully, in some cases, a few persisted.

38
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:37,400
As the US became more diverse, publishers sought ways to pursue that expanding demographic

39
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,640
of non-white guys, and maybe the even more elusive demographic of women.

40
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,320
To that end, an increasingly broad range of diverse characters were and are still being

41
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,320
created.

42
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,200
Of course, the earliest attempts were not always the most thoughtful.

43
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,240
Luke Cage was the product of the Blaxploitation craze of the 70s, and Shang-Chi, a product

44
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,480
of the Kung Fu movie craze.

45
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,200
These characters are obviously cheap stereotypes, although they have grown over the years to

46
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,700
be a bit more interesting and complex.

47
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,240
In recent years, the two biggest superhero comic publishers, Marvel and DC Comics, have

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:15,160
tried to escape racial stereotypes and present as wide a lineup of diverse characters as

49
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,160
they possibly could.

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,480
I'm going to talk briefly about Black Panther.

51
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,360
I'm assuming you've probably seen it because I think everyone saw it.

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,820
The opening scene of Black Panther tells you a lot about who this movie is intended for.

53
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:32,440
It features Black children taking a break from their game of basketball to look up at

54
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,200
something exciting happening.

55
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,560
It's an image you could have seen in theaters around the world when Black Panther was screening.

56
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,320
To me, it seemed like a very clear message that this is who the movie was for.

57
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,280
Not just because it had a black superhero, like Blade or Spawn.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,000
This was a film with a writer, director, and cast that was predominantly black.

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,560
Set in Africa, and ensconced in African culture, it meant a lot to people.

60
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,360
I remember seeing this video after Black Panther came out.

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,960
I've never left a movie and wanted to start a dance party, but that's how much it means

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,000
to people to have a character who finally speaks to their experiences and culture.

63
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,040
It's a chance to feel as though their stories are finally being told.

64
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:24,400
Stories that weren't being told in superhero movies about white Americans.

65
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,160
This is why representation matters.

66
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,840
Comics have been reaching out to audiences in the same spirit, with new characters such

67
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,680
as the New Muslim Miss Marvel, a half-black half-Hispanic Spider-Man, and a black Captain

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
America.

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,160
And if you're wondering why we're getting so many variations on the same characters,

70
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,840
that's kind of been a thing in comics for decades.

71
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,880
We've had four flashes, five robins, and more green lanterns than I can count.

72
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,120
For what successes there have been, there have been far more failures.

73
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:59,480
A sad fact of comics is that most people don't like new characters as much as the old ones.

74
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,000
Things typically revert back to when the character was most popular, which is generally what

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,720
they were like in their earliest stories.

76
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,600
It's why Spider-Man is often depicted as a teenager.

77
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,300
These are the tropes and eras that made them successful, and the ones that are most familiar

78
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:16,520
and comfortable to readers, going back to a time when characters were typically white

79
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,000
men.

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,920
Criticism from the left about the state of comics isn't particularly new.

81
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:31,800
Gail Simone, the eventual writer of comics including Secret Six and Birds of Prey, teamed

82
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,240
with some of her feminist friends to create the website Women in Refrigerators back in

83
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,880
1999.

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,880
This references a rather infamous story where Green Lantern's girlfriend was murdered and

85
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
stuffed into a refrigerator.

86
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:49,760
In addition to that story, it chronicled the many ways in which female characters had been

87
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:54,380
metaphorically stuffed into fridges to create some pathos for a male character.

88
00:05:54,380 --> 00:06:00,240
Most controversy that popped up tended to be storms and teacups, a lot of intense discussion

89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,960
and debate, though usually in a few months it would kind of go away.

90
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,200
Like this one of a statue of Mary Jane where she's washing Spider-Man's costume, people

91
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:14,240
thought that creating a statue where Spider-Man's girlfriend is washing his clothes in a thong

92
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,880
and low-cut shirt might not be the most positive image for women.

93
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,040
Then this whole thing called gamergate started, and suddenly people were very upset about

94
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:30,360
depictions of women and minorities in video games, and this rhetoric was sadly quite transferable

95
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,080
to the comics community.

96
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,640
Then there was this variant cover of the first issue of Spider-Woman by Italian artist

97
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,240
Milo Menara, revealed in August of 2014.

98
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,160
The uproar around this was initially called Spider-Buttgate, it was the controversy of

99
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,720
the moment when the term comicsgate came to life.

100
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,200
As best as I can tell, the term comicsgate was originally used ironically, but very quickly

101
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:58,560
it fell into favor with a group not too dissimilar from the gamergate crowd.

102
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,520
While the movement was still some time from really taking off, it's here that the term

103
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:14,520
first took root in the minds of a few people.

104
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,840
The first high-profile harassment case often attributed to the comicsgate crowd targeted

105
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,400
Chelsea Kane.

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,120
Before entering comics, Kane distinguished herself writing a series of successful thriller

107
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,840
novels with the first three all being New York Times bestsellers.

108
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,700
In 2016 she was hired by Marvel to work on a new Mockingbird ongoing series, though critically

109
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,080
well received, its sales were less than stellar, and it was cancelled with issue number eight.

110
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,880
For that final issue though, Kane had the artist produce a cover where Mockingbird was

111
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:46,320
wearing a t-shirt that read, ask me about my feminist agenda.

112
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:51,520
The backlash to this cover was immediate, it got the full anti-SJW treatment, including

113
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,680
a shout out in a Carl Benjamin video where he misreads the title.

114
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:05,520
This is actually the cover of a Marvel magazine, Civil War II, Civil War II, Civil War II.

115
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,720
Although the harassment surrounding Kane's tenure on Mockingbird eventually drove her

116
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:15,140
away from social media entirely, reflecting back on it in 2018 she also highlights the

117
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,800
positive experiences of fans coming to support her through that time.

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,280
It even translated to a sales spike for the first volume of the Mockingbird ongoing series

119
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,880
and two Eisner nominations for the title, including one for Kane as writer of the year.

120
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,640
Kane didn't describe the Twitter mob after the eighth issue as driving her off Twitter

121
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:36,680
though, rather it was the everyday harassment that really got to her and she experienced

122
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,360
it constantly.

123
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:44,360
The intense outroer after that number eight issue was just the most public symptom taken

124
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,360
from her blog.

125
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:51,040
I quit Twitter, I deactivated my account Thursday after receiving several misogynist and or

126
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,520
jerky comments the night before.

127
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,520
Several.

128
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Not dozens.

129
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,000
Not a deluge.

130
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
One is too many.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,420
I was tired of wasting energy dealing with the constant low-level misogyny and meanness

132
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:05,400
that pollutes a certain kind of comic fandom.

133
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,400
I posted some comments reflecting my frustration.

134
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:14,400
The next morning, when I logged on to deactivate, I saw that I had lost approximately 1,500

135
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
followers overnight.

136
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:18,320
I also saw my notifications were filling up with new followers.

137
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,520
I saw that comments were flooding my feed.

138
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,360
I had no idea what was happening.

139
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,520
I had never seen that kind of activity on my account, but I figured it wasn't good.

140
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,080
I went through the deactivation.

141
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,080
I assumed I had been trolled in some kind of organized sense, but I didn't know.

142
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Still don't.

143
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,720
Frankly, I didn't care.

144
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
It was moot.

145
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,160
I was done.

146
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:44,160
Kane didn't leave comics, though she would later say she felt as if comics had left her.

147
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,080
She's currently working on a series called Man-Eaters for Image Comics.

148
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,820
It's about girls turning into wildcats when they go through their period.

149
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:54,840
She has yet to write again for Marvel Comics.

150
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,800
Kane was the first high-profile target of a mob that would target women, typically working

151
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,360
for Marvel Comics, which is perceived as being controlled by the SJWs.

152
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,560
In July of 2017, Marvel editor Heather Antos posted a selfie of herself with a number of

153
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,580
other women who worked at Marvel Comics getting a milkshake.

154
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:16,240
It was a tribute to Flo Steinberg, the most prominent female face at Marvel Comics during

155
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,360
its major boom period in the 1960s.

156
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,720
Steinberg was officially one of the only two full-time employees at Marvel, with the artists

157
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,680
largely working on a freelance basis and the only other full-timer being Stan Lee.

158
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:34,180
This seemingly innocuous photo prompted outrage, typically from men unhappy with the recent

159
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:38,600
direction of Marvel Comics, creating more titles featuring non-white male characters

160
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,560
and hiring more non-white male creators.

161
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,560
The outrage backfired pretty hard as the Make Mine Milkshake hashtag caught on, people rallied

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,860
around many of these women, showing solidarity in the most American way imaginable, drinking

163
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,420
a milkshake for women's rights.

164
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,260
But momentum was building, and the movement would ferment from here.

165
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:02,260
Although there is no central authority in the comicscape movement, we can get a vague

166
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:07,060
idea of their grievances by looking at the most common criticisms and demands they make

167
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,500
of what superhero comics should be.

168
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:15,500
Summarized as best I can from the lists I looked up online, their demands are

169
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:20,980
Less politics, specifically left-wing or progressive politics and stories.

170
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,640
Not hiring writers and artists on the basis of their gender, sexuality, or ethnicity.

171
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,500
Not replacing, embarrassing, or changing older heroes.

172
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,500
To have their complaints be taken seriously and not brushed aside as bigotry.

173
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:40,460
What's perhaps most noticeable in the language of comic skaters is that they don't consider

174
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:46,860
themselves a subgroup of dissatisfied comics fans, but rather they are THE comics fans.

175
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,520
They are at the core of what keeps this hobby churning along.

176
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,260
The silent majority who are frustrated with having their concerns being swept aside for

177
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:00,060
the sake of trying to attract an audience that does not represent actual comic fans

178
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,740
and can't possibly love the medium as much as they do.

179
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:08,760
It ties into the whole idea of a fake geek girl, a charge that was leveled specifically

180
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:12,060
at Anthos and often other female creators.

181
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:17,700
That a girl invading a space primarily dominated by men can't possibly be just as big a fan

182
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,620
of the subculture, or if they were real fans, they wouldn't want to make any changes.

183
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,220
It's not a coincidence that a space dominated by white men is threatened by the inclusion

184
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:30,980
of anyone who doesn't fit that characteristic.

185
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,540
You can see that in the implicit assumption of point number two that anyone hired to

186
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:41,060
work in comics that isn't a white man is likely there because of some affirmative action

187
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,460
program rather than their ability.

188
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,620
I could go on about the many shitty white male writers and artists who have worked in

189
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:51,820
comics without their identity being part of any criticism against them, but I really only

190
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:56,020
highlight these claims from the comic skate crowd so we can understand what their complaints

191
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:01,060
are, and as we'll see how that masks a bigotry that probably exists on a conscious

192
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,340
or unconscious level.

193
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:06,940
Before going on, I also want to acknowledge something important.

194
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:11,700
None of this animosity is new, and that I've highlighted a negative reaction to white women

195
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:17,100
doesn't mean it wasn't, and isn't also happening to men and women of color and LGBT

196
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,140
creators.

197
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:22,580
We live in a world where white women feminism tends to grab more attention than others,

198
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,220
and while I won't pretend that white women don't face prejudice in their lives, it's

199
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:31,580
a bit frustrating that the bigotry faced by other groups isn't as visibly opposed.

200
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:35,500
After the milkshake moment, a few prominent voices began to appear within the comics game

201
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,700
movement.

202
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,380
The most vocal is almost certainly Richard Meyer, who creates YouTube videos under the

203
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:48,660
channel name Comics and Diversity, rebranded in 2019 as Think About Comics.

204
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:54,140
The channel is typically Meyer commenting on issues, both physical comics and actual

205
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:59,660
news issues, relating to the comic industry, usually railing against characters, comics,

206
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:03,980
and stories he feels are being pushed upon the fans by the SJWs.

207
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,780
His videos often include him destroying comic books he doesn't like.

208
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:12,780
His YouTube channel has grown quite a bit, and is currently sitting at nearly 94,000

209
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:16,860
subscribers, and he's been featured on programs like the Jim Jefferies show.

210
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:23,260
We of course are rockin' those A-cups, anything above a B-cup.

211
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,980
You hate women.

212
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:31,420
Ms. Marvel was introduced as a Pakistani-American Muslim, Riri Williams, who replaced Iron Man.

213
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:36,220
If you don't like her, it's because you're racist or sexist, but probably both.

214
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,500
It would upset a racist.

215
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,260
I think it would.

216
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:45,660
His commentary is perhaps most notable in that it absolutely refuses to understand subtext

217
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,900
or see superhero comics as anything more than mindless entertainment.

218
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:53,180
As dopey as he may sound, he does have a following.

219
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:59,500
And in one video in particular, The Dark Roast, a private video since deleted, a darker side

220
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,500
came out.

221
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,020
Here are a few comments he made.

222
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:08,060
I really didn't want to read this, so I asked for some help.

223
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:15,260
Heather Antos is a cum dumpster who got a job at Marvel because Jordan White is a sad

224
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,740
sack perv who jacked off to her, okay?

225
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:23,060
The story is that she went and saw him at a convention.

226
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:27,540
It's like, I'd like to be an editor, and he's like, oh, this is going to be a hard sell

227
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,540
for HR.

228
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,020
Like, Jordan White's going to go to Marvel HR.

229
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,580
I really need you to hire her.

230
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:36,380
My spank bank is getting incredibly low.

231
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,380
What?

232
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:40,340
What the fuck?

233
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,820
Okay.

234
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:50,020
Magdalene Visagio is a fucking crazy person, a criminal, who is definitely, definitely

235
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:55,620
going to kill himself, and it's just where, when, and how.

236
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:58,980
By the way, mags did not transition.

237
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,980
Mags is a...

238
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,700
I don't even want to say this.

239
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,540
It's literally just a pervert.

240
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,420
I can't read this.

241
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
This, I...

242
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,620
Yeah, this is so bad.

243
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:17,900
Yeah, not going to read this next sentence.

244
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:27,340
But they came along just at the right time that we're all, oh, no.

245
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,380
But they came along just at the right time that we're all the trans issues, and they're

246
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,140
like, oh, we can weaponize this.

247
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,940
Fuck that comment, okay.

248
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,500
So yeah, that's the kind of guy he is.

249
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:48,060
He defended himself later on his YouTube channel, saying that these were all jokes, and shouldn't

250
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:52,180
be held against him because he only said them once.

251
00:16:52,180 --> 00:17:00,300
I can't believe if you never heard the context that you're actually offended.

252
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:04,140
I can't believe that, actually, no joke.

253
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:09,900
But again, I've made 1,000 videos, 1,000 more.

254
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,260
Is it a pattern behavior?

255
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,460
Has it been repeated?

256
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:16,500
Am I doing one like this right now?

257
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,500
There was actually...

258
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,940
The plan was actually to do several of them, but after it was done, I was like, pfft, I

259
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,940
don't know what I'm doing.

260
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,940
That was lame.

261
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
It was lame.

262
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:23,940
It was forced.

263
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,420
I actually found it to be very boring.

264
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:29,540
When I re-listened to it five months later, I was like, this is one of my worst videos

265
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,540
ever.

266
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,540
It's so boring.

267
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
Right.

268
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:35,740
I guess if you say it once, it doesn't count.

269
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,140
He thinks he did a bad job in telling the jokes.

270
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,500
He doesn't seem to be upset with their actual content or any of the claims within them.

271
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,300
Meyer has also made videos alongside comic artist Ethan Van Scryver.

272
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,700
Although many voices of ComicsGate are typically fans outside the industry, Van Scryver was

273
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:56,760
an established artist, having worked for Marvel and DC Comics.

274
00:17:56,760 --> 00:18:01,480
Most notable for having done the artwork for the dreadful Green Lantern Rebirth and Flash

275
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,900
Rebirth miniseries is...

276
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:07,860
Van Scryver has been something of an asshole for years, and his association with Meyer

277
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,380
seems to be continuing that trend.

278
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:14,500
Meyer also had another run-in with an industry pro, writer Mark Wade.

279
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:19,700
Wade has been especially prolific in his comics writing career, including a spectacular run

280
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:25,620
on Fantastic Four with Mike Waringo, and a fantastic run on Daredevil with Chris Samney.

281
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:30,100
In September of 2017, Mark Wade issued a statement on his Facebook.

282
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,100
This statement is in regard to the Baltimore Comic Convention.

283
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:38,620
There's a serial YouTube harasser named Richard C. Meyer who I'm told may be attending

284
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,620
as a fan.

285
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:44,340
If anyone sees this gentleman, or any of his friends, I need you to come find me and tell

286
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,340
me immediately.

287
00:18:45,340 --> 00:18:49,540
Even if I'm on a panel, come up and interrupt.

288
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,620
And this conversation eventually happened over the phone.

289
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,700
Wade and Meyer chose to keep the discussion private.

290
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,900
Instead, following the encounter, Wade had a follow-up post on his Facebook.

291
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,100
The actual problem is that there are a large number of younger creators, professionals,

292
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,460
staffers in this industry, a larger number than you could possibly imagine who do not

293
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,500
have that same privilege.

294
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,700
In this case, a platform.

295
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,660
They are being harassed, repeatedly, and it's getting worse.

296
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,220
As I say, I've been talking with many of them over the last few weeks.

297
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,240
These are not histrionic people.

298
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,340
These are not overly dramatic people.

299
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:30,440
These are reasonable adults, some of whom cannot speak out because of their employers.

300
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:34,080
And yet, they are legitimately frightened by harassers who threaten to come find them

301
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,840
at conventions, at stores, at their homes.

302
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,960
One was told she would be burned to death.

303
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,440
Another was told she would be put down like a dog.

304
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,800
And those are examples of some of the less hateful attacks.

305
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,920
The Wade and Meyer conflict would grow over time and would eventually turn into a lawsuit.

306
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:55,880
Meyer had crowdfunded a comics project called Jawbreakers and was to have it published by

307
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,400
Antarctic Press when Wade shared some unflattering information about him and Antarctic Press

308
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,900
was quick to cancel their agreement.

309
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,360
But more importantly than the two white guys snapping at each other are the marginalized

310
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:13,440
voices who don't have the privilege of this large platform to air some of their grievances

311
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,440
as highlighted by Wade in his Facebook post.

312
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:20,840
This harassment is something fomented by the comicsgate crowd, going insofar as to make

313
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,960
blacklists and targeting comic shops that disagreed with their mission.

314
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,360
Before Antarctic Press ended their relationship with Meyer, a number of comic shops publicly

315
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,600
stated that they would not carry his title.

316
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,040
In response, he asked his sizable audience to find out where these stores were and create

317
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
a list.

318
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,200
At least one of these stores was the target of vandalism, variant edition comics in Edmonton,

319
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Alberta.

320
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,240
We push positivity, we push inclusion, we push diversity.

321
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:51,320
That's why she decided to take a public stance on an issue that's dividing the comic book

322
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,320
world, electing not to stock an upcoming book by an author known for opposing what

323
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,280
he calls forced diversity in comics.

324
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,040
I don't know what he wants, but I feel like he just, if he wants anything, it's destruction

325
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,040
and regression.

326
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,980
The store's tweet blew up with responses from supporters and critics.

327
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,560
The author, Richard Meyer, even made a video response on his YouTube channel.

328
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,080
Variant edition in Edmonton, Canada.

329
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,720
They're doing multiple steps of an intimidation and blogging campaign.

330
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,320
I see it as a statement of, as we can get to you.

331
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:29,240
LeBlanc has nothing to go on but a gut feeling, but she's sure the crime isn't a coincidence.

332
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,840
For this to be a random attack at the same time as we're being press online, what else

333
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,920
could it be?

334
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,600
Another well-publicized incident occurred in late August of 2018.

335
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:47,580
Marcia, widow of beloved and extremely talented comic artist Darwin Cook, was targeted on

336
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:52,060
social media after she made a tweet about how her late husband would have absolutely

337
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,820
opposed the opinions and actions of the Comics Gate crowd.

338
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,660
The backlash against her was as predictable as it was depressing.

339
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:04,940
She had an exchange with Ethan Van Scryver that is well worth reading in its entirety.

340
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:10,660
Marcia is responding to a video in which comics artist Billy Tucci mistakenly says that Darwin

341
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:13,180
Cook would be a supporter of Comics Gate.

342
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:15,180
Hi guys, I'm right here.

343
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:18,100
And Ethan, it looks like your friends are being transphobic.

344
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,580
I'm sure you wouldn't support anything like that, would you?

345
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,060
You certainly would ask your friends to stop bringing my name up, right?

346
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,940
Because I haven't seen that yet.

347
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:29,500
I've been pretty happy to mute people who are harassing me on Twitter, Martha.

348
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,700
Or block them.

349
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:35,020
People who use my name spitefully, who lie about me, and torment me and my family over

350
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,820
political differences.

351
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,100
It goes a long way towards peace of mind.

352
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,700
Just mute them.

353
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:45,020
I find what goes a long way is for the ringleader to use his dog whistle to call his baby's

354
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,020
home.

355
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:49,940
But sure, these children are whipped up by you and it's pathetic you can't say leave

356
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,340
her alone to them.

357
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,460
Cowards, all of you.

358
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:56,420
What do you really think Darwin could do right now, Ethan?

359
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:59,660
Tell the widow to use mute or stand up to a bunch of idiots?

360
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:02,100
I know the answer.

361
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,060
The comics industry has become incredibly cruel, Marcia, and I don't wish you to endure

362
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,300
the abuse that I have over the past few months.

363
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:12,820
But I've learned quite a bit about how the internet works and how mobs are manipulated

364
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:16,460
and weaponized into endless conflict, and this isn't okay.

365
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:20,860
Ethan, I know you have felt isolated from the general industry, but you need to know

366
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:25,900
it is because most people feel you are stoking a dangerous group of fans that hate women,

367
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,140
people of color, and all the gay community.

368
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,540
That's not okay, and Darwin will not be associated with it.

369
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:38,020
They're wrong, and Darwin was also an individualist who trusted his own instincts, even when the

370
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:40,420
crowd wanted other things for him.

371
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,860
I'm never going to watch this or any other comicscape video.

372
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,860
Sorry.

373
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,500
I have no interest in your group and wish you personally the best in life.

374
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,860
I hope you snap out of this cult hypnosis at some point.

375
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,140
Well, I'll settle for that.

376
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,780
I miss you and this broke my heart, and I want you to know I think about you both often.

377
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,380
Please know you are loved.

378
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,980
Just so you know, your fans are all up on me about this and calling me trash, garbage,

379
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,940
and a liar, so any time you'd like to tell them to back off is great.

380
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,940
Darwin agreed with you on nothing and you know this.

381
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,340
James, I'm blocking this dude.

382
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,620
Tell him to apologize to Nassar.

383
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,300
Are you going to tell anyone to apologize to me?

384
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:25,780
Yes, SJW's in comics apologized to Marcia Cook for cynically using her as a shield to

385
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,940
attack comicsgate and for lying to her.

386
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:33,300
It was Darwin's dear friend Billy who claimed him for comicsgate, and I am disgusted by

387
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,860
this whole affair.

388
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,500
This wasn't fair to you or Darwin, Marcia.

389
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,380
Yeah, don't throw Billy under the bus here.

390
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,100
Billy doesn't know what your group does and was kind enough to give you five seconds of

391
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,100
his time.

392
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:49,140
Billy's friends are quote tweeting him and saying, Darr offered himself.

393
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Yours are.

394
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:53,540
Billy may be a conservative, but he's nothing like you.

395
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:56,700
And this is Billy Tucci, another artist who chimes in.

396
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:01,860
I apologize for any misconception that I claimed my dear friend Darr for any cause.

397
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:05,200
Twitter is a vicious home for those who'd never confront you in person.

398
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,960
You all know where I stand with friends both left and right.

399
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,280
Hopefully soon we'll all stand in the arena of civility.

400
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,740
It was not a good moment for Van Scryver, particularly when he asked the SJWs to apologize

401
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,680
after Marcia was quite clear it was his fanbase that was harassing her.

402
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,940
A number of prominent industry pros came to Martha's defense, and a mantra penned by

403
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:33,240
writer Tom Taylor on Twitter a few days later was soon reposted by a number of other comics

404
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
professionals.

405
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,480
This was the first major anti-comicsgate display from professionals in the industry.

406
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:44,480
But again, and I feel as though I can't hit this note enough, this was a comicsgate attack

407
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,800
that got attention after it hit these creators close to home.

408
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,760
In this case, Martha herself can make the point better than I can.

409
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:56,800
Hopefully this is my last comment on the subject, but I agree with everyone saying it is annoying

410
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,040
that people didn't get on board the reality of what these idiots are doing until it was

411
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,560
a white wife attacked.

412
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,920
I don't think as many people would care WTF happened here, except that they were thinking

413
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,180
of me as an extension of a man.

414
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,540
So take that how you will.

415
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,760
While researching this video, I came across an interesting article from 2014 on ICV2 by

416
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:28,460
Rob Selkowitz titled, If comicsgate ever happens, it will be catastrophic.

417
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:33,940
It was responding to an article about gamergate by Ezra Klein, discussing how the politicization

418
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,140
of everything is bleeding into our hobbies.

419
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:42,540
In his article, Selkowitz highlights the dangers of longtime fans becoming self-appointed gatekeepers

420
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,620
to a hobby, denying entry of diverse newcomers into their space.

421
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:51,020
The danger perceived to them is the undermining of their authority in this space.

422
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,020
They call themselves the real or true fans of something, and anyone not adhering to this

423
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,820
vision is an outsider trying to destroy something closely tied to their identity.

424
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,700
Selkowitz goes on to point out how this sentiment has existed for a while.

425
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,140
Comicsgate could do the same, leaving a lasting harm to comics.

426
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:12,700
It's an interesting article and quite perceptive, though to me this fear of politicizing comics

427
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,020
is not a problem for the medium itself, but rather the relationship fans have with it.

428
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,580
Politics have long been a part of comics, and broadening the representation of different

429
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:26,740
people into comics will only increase that, at least if it happens in a society that functions

430
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,260
like ours does.

431
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:31,380
Here are two examples of political stories.

432
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:35,820
The character Northstar of the X-Men, one of the first openly gay characters in superhero

433
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,300
comics, was married in 2012.

434
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,580
It was the first ever gay wedding in superhero comics.

435
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,960
Conversely in 2013, DC Comics refused the Batwoman creative team to let their lead character

436
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,420
marry her female partner, Maggie Sawyer.

437
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:56,300
J.H. Williams III and W. Holden Blackman, in response, announced that they would be

438
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,540
leaving as the editorial team on Batwoman.

439
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:04,020
Although these would have simply been weddings in these characters' lives, the editorial

440
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:08,020
decision, one way or another, could easily be considered political.

441
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,320
One decision favored left-wing politics, the other right-wing politics.

442
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,020
When a character's wedding is considered inherently political because of their sexual

443
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:22,400
orientation, this doesn't say we're politicizing comics, but rather we live in a time when

444
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:28,000
gay marriage, and by extension someone's sexuality, is a political question.

445
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,180
The pattern holds true for many other types of minority representation, where characters

446
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,780
of color are expected to not comment on race issues, and female characters are expected

447
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:42,220
to stay silent about feminism, and especially not wear a t-shirt about it.

448
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:46,420
Wanting representation in comic books doesn't have to be an inherently political thing.

449
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,860
It can be as simple as some kids wanting to see a superhero who looks just like them.

450
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:54,860
It's only political when someone says it shouldn't be happening.

451
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:59,520
Ironically, their shallow understanding of comics should make the comicsgate crowd more

452
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,660
understanding of where these young readers are coming from.

453
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:08,080
The fact that some grown white men can't manage to read comics featuring non-white male characters

454
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,420
says so much more.

455
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:15,740
And if the idea of superheroes being used as a lens for slightly older readers to examine

456
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:21,180
modern-day issues from a different perspective, I'm not sure why that's inherently a bad

457
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,180
thing.

458
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,940
Obviously, it could be bad when it's done poorly, but again, I go back to a point I

459
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,620
made earlier in this video.

460
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:33,340
Why focus on the diversity and not, say, bad writing or bad art?

461
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,900
Perhaps they should be asking themselves some serious questions about diversity itself,

462
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:42,340
and why is it they get annoyed or angry whenever it's mentioned in a storyline?

463
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:47,300
The comicsgate crowd's problem isn't just its embarrassingly shallow reading of comics.

464
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:51,060
It's the hostility that foments the outright harassment of creators who are members of

465
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,860
the LGBT community, people of color, and women.

466
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:59,180
This is a line that is frequently crossed, often hidden from sight, that becomes part

467
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:04,020
of the daily churn of artists trying to express themselves in a medium that has been historically

468
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,340
dominated by white men.

469
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,100
It's not that white men have to be shitty to them.

470
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,700
It's that a portion of them are, and they refuse to behave like adults.

471
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,580
On the bright side, recent news on comicsgate is that it's over.

472
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,100
Meyer is declaring mission accomplished, and the industry has supposedly been saved from

473
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:25,580
being taken over by the SJWs.

474
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,500
Is comicsgate successful or unsuccessful?

475
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,500
I don't know.

476
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,420
Is customer service better or worse?

477
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,860
Are the comics better or worse than they were a year ago?

478
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:39,500
It seems to me the comics are better, and I'm sure there are multiple factors, but

479
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:49,580
I would say it is partly successful to the beliefs of people who liked comicsgate.

480
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,620
Whether comicsgate needs to go on, I don't think so.

481
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:58,420
The claims of victory and departure ring hollow to me, but it does signal that this unifying

482
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,380
hashtag is falling out of fashion.

483
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:04,940
In a way, this video could almost be considered a post-mortem.

484
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:09,500
But I hope if there's one thing people take away from this, is that while this childish

485
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:15,980
abusive behavior can be focused around a hashtag, even after that hashtag goes away, the problem

486
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,660
still exists.

487
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:22,860
Before leaving though, I want to leave us all with a few words from comics legend Stan Lee.

488
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:27,260
Although he has a checkered past, specifically in how he treated some of the artists he worked

489
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:32,220
with in Marvel's early days, he did leave us with a lovely short message before he passed

490
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,620
away on his thoughts about diversity in the comics industry.

491
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,500
Hi, heroes.

492
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
This is Stan Lee coming at you.

493
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:46,580
I just want you to know, Marvel has always been and always will be a reflection of the

494
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:49,780
world right outside our window.

495
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:55,500
That world may change and evolve, but the one thing that will never change is the way

496
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,340
we tell our stories of heroism.

497
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:06,700
Those stories have room for everyone, regardless of their race, gender, religion, or color

498
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,420
of their skin.

499
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:16,140
The only things we don't have room for are hatred, intolerance, and bigotry.

500
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,140
That man next to you, he's your brother.

501
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,420
That woman over there, she's your sister.

502
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,820
And that kid walking by, hey, who knows?

503
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,020
He may have the proportionate strength of a spider.

504
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:37,220
We're all part of one big family, the human family, and we all come together in the body

505
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,060
of Marvel.

506
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,980
And you, you're part of that family.

507
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:49,500
You're part of the Marvel universe that moves ever upward and onward to greater glory.

508
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:53,900
In other words, Excelsior.

509
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,260
A big thanks to Mexie for helping me out.

510
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,620
I'm so sorry I asked you to read something so terrible.
