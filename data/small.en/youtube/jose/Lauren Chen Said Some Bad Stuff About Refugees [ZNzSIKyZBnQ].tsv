0	4720	So, this video was not supposed to happen.
4720	6480	I'm in the middle of a very big project.
6480	10900	It's another deep dive into something you've probably heard of this time.
10900	16740	But today I saw a video from Lauren Chen, and it just really pissed me off.
16740	21020	So here I am making a response video to it because there were so many factual errors
21020	25500	in it, so many ridiculous statements that I just couldn't help myself.
25500	28040	So let's dive into this video.
28040	34000	It's titled Immigration Crisis, Take More Migrants Says UN.
34000	39000	As Global News reports, quote, the United Nations is urging Canada to help ease Mexico's
39000	44200	refugee burden by helping resettle some of the most vulnerable of its new arrivals, including
44200	47480	women, children, and LGBTQ2 people.
47480	52120	Mexico is feeling the squeeze from an unprecedented exodus of people fleeing Central American
52120	53120	countries.
53120	57760	And some of the worst violence from nations not actually at war is forcing families northward.
57760	62720	Our pitch to Canada is to do more, said Mark Manley, the Mexico representative of the United
62720	64920	Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
64920	69160	The article continues that the request comes as the United States takes a harder line on
69160	73140	its Mexican border, with President Donald Trump branding the caravans of migrants as
73140	76560	being laced with violent criminals bent on destabilizing his country.
76560	78080	Oh look, the first error.
78080	82800	We're not talking about migrants crossing borders here, we're talking about refugees
82800	84640	being resettled.
84640	88880	The way the refugee resettlement process works is that someone fleeing their country applies
88880	90240	for asylum.
90240	94240	And if they're granted asylum and given refugee status, they can then apply to be
94240	96320	moved somewhere else.
96320	101040	We're talking about people who have fled Central America to Mexico, applied for asylum,
101040	104960	been given refugee status, and then are being transferred over to Canada.
104960	108380	They shouldn't be considered vaguely defined migrants.
108380	110600	These are vetted refugees.
110600	113540	Here's an example of the numbers Lauren Chen loves so much.
113540	117180	The ones that seem like they're arguing for her point, but when you actually dig
117180	120180	into them, don't really do that.
120180	126140	In 2018, under the leadership of Justin Trudeau and the Liberal Party, Canada resettled more
126140	128980	refugees than any other country.
128980	135060	As the BBC reports, the country accepted just over 28,000 refugees last year, with the United
135060	138440	States coming in second with 22,900.
138440	143920	But to anyone who would ask Canada to do more, those numbers should tell you that we
143920	146520	have already done more than enough.
146520	151080	The reason Canada, the United States, and Australia rank so high for resettlement numbers
151080	154280	is because it's very difficult for refugees to get here.
154280	158440	They'd basically have to swim across the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean just to get to Canada.
158440	161800	So generally, they don't have to worry about a lot of refugees showing up at their borders.
161800	166400	If we look at the BBC article, Chen's sights mentions that there are 70 million people
166400	168280	who are currently displaced.
168280	170680	70 million.
170680	173680	Canada resettled 28,000.
173680	176120	Consider that disparity for a moment.
176120	178400	You might be wondering where these people are.
178400	184840	The top five countries currently taking care of refugees are Turkey with 3.7 million refugees,
184840	191480	Pakistan with 1.4 million refugees, Uganda with 1.2 million, Sudan with 1.1 million,
191480	195060	and Germany with 1.1 million.
195060	197700	That 28,000 number isn't exactly accurate.
197700	201660	That was just how many Canada took in within 2018 itself.
201660	209340	The total number of refugees currently living in Canada is 114,109.
209340	212860	And there are currently 78,806 asylum seekers.
212860	216820	The difference between a refugee and an asylum seeker is that an asylum seeker is generally
216820	219460	someone who is applying for refugee status.
219460	223940	A refugee is actually a legally defined term, one that is given to someone who has been
223940	230820	properly vetted by, for example, the UN-HCR, which is the UN Refugee Agency.
230820	235580	From here, the video turns into a lot of generic vague UN bashing.
235580	239900	She actually made a whole video where she criticizes the UN and she doesn't seem to
239900	246860	understand it and what it's supposed to do, so she just seems to think it does nothing.
246860	247860	Think of it.
247860	253060	What national long-term policies, which have made countries better, can the UN take credit
253060	254060	for?
254060	257100	The UN isn't responsible for national policy.
257100	260060	That would be the responsibility of a nation's federal government.
260060	262820	The UN isn't a governing body.
262820	265540	I don't know how to explain this more simply.
265540	270500	If you're complaining that the UN hasn't fixed these nations, whatever that means,
270500	272660	it's not because the UN hasn't been trying.
272660	277420	It all depends on the participation of the member nations to make it all work.
277420	282540	What the UN tries to pitch is them improving the world, is simply moving people from bad
282540	285820	countries to good countries.
285820	289900	And then she says something like this, where she's under the impression that the UN's
289900	294540	primary goal has been to relocate people through its refugee program.
294540	300900	The UN-HCR's mission is not to fix countries with any sort of internal strife, it's to
300900	304140	protect the well-being of people who have been displaced.
304140	308820	I don't know why the UN is being defined by a single program that operates under the
308820	313940	General Assembly, and then being judged for not meeting these other unnamed goals.
313940	318580	But it's an absurdly reductous reading of one of the most important institutions in
318580	319660	the world.
319660	326500	And if you want a list of some of the things the UN has done, it's helped eradicate smallpox.
326500	328460	I think that's pretty good.
328460	333340	Through UNICEF, it's saved the lives of tens of millions of children.
333340	337900	It's helped reduce the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
337900	343180	The General Assembly's clamping down on South Africa helped end apartheid in the region.
343180	346620	It's actually done a lot of really great things in the world, and I'll include links with
346620	349660	even more stuff it's done in the description box.
349660	352580	Let's take a moment to see Lauren fail to read.
352580	358020	Article 14 of the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that everyone has the
358020	362300	right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.
362300	364860	Uh, I'm sorry, no.
364860	367060	How on earth is that a human right?
367060	370140	I mean, I guess you could say you have the right to seek asylum.
370140	375100	You can seek whatever you want, I suppose, but you don't have the right to enjoy asylum
375100	376900	in other countries.
376900	378860	Where would that right come from?
378860	381500	No, that's not how you read that.
381500	386460	No one is saying everyone can simply be granted asylum on request.
386460	391420	The term enjoy asylum means that no person should ever be forbidden from being granted
391420	392420	asylum.
392420	396240	That is, someone who has gone through the asylum application process and being granted
396240	397880	refugee status.
397880	401800	Pretty much every country in the world has some number of refugees living in it, so the
401800	406160	fact that this simple article blows Lauren's mind shows how little she understands the
406160	407160	process.
407160	411780	Literally, no country on earth, as far as I know, grants asylum to anyone who shows
411780	413320	up and asks for it.
413320	418280	There's always a vetting process, and considering the UNHCR helps manage a lot of these vetting
418280	421160	processes, I think they support them.
421160	424160	Not to mention that persecution is just such a vague word.
424160	427760	Essentially, all it means is ill treatment or hostility.
427760	429440	No, it doesn't.
429440	435120	Okay, let's actually do something fun and talk about what a refugee is actually defined
435120	437720	as according to the UNHCR.
437720	442960	A refugee is someone who has been forced to flee his or her country because of persecution,
442960	443960	war, or violence.
443960	449280	A refugee has a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality,
449280	453120	political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.
453120	456680	Most likely, they cannot return home or are afraid to do so.
456680	462680	War and ethnic, tribal, and religious violence are leading causes of refugees fleeing their
462680	463800	countries.
463800	466880	That seems pretty specific.
466880	470760	Lauren seems to be under the impression that there is no vetting process.
470760	474880	Everybody in that country gets to just leave and choose another country to move to, and
474880	478360	it has to be granted because it's their human right to seek asylum.
478360	483200	Does any Western European person who speaks out against Islam or mass immigration, what
483200	489280	they call hate speech over there, get to come to the US and seek asylum under this declaration?
489280	490520	Is that how that works?
490520	491520	That's weird.
491520	495360	I hear a lot of anti-Islam stuff coming out of Western Europe all the time, but I guess
495360	498280	they're being persecuted somewhere, okay?
498280	503480	As far as I can tell, no one from Western Europe has applied for asylum because they've
503480	507000	been persecuted for speaking out against Islam.
507000	508040	They can try that.
508040	511080	I don't think that application is going to turn out so well.
511080	515440	The fact that she thinks the UN-HCRC is no difference between that and someone who's
515440	520720	trying to escape a war zone, it stretches my ability to believe she's being a serious
520720	521720	person.
521720	524200	Now she's going to say something even more ridiculous.
524200	528120	What the UN is saying is that it would be someone's human right to just show up at your
528120	531400	country and say, hey, I'm going to enjoy asylum here.
531400	535560	And in order to not violate their rights, not only would you have to let them in, but
535560	540600	you would also be obligated to give them food, housing, and clothing.
540600	541840	F*** you!
541840	544520	I'm genuinely stunned at this.
544520	550240	Okay, leaving aside Lauren's outrage at the idea that all people should have access to
550240	556280	food and shelter, somehow confusing it with the UN advocating some sort of socialist nanny
556280	558840	state, I think that's how she's reading it.
558840	564720	Leaving all that aside, an asylum seeker actually is entitled to food and shelter.
564720	569360	The reason asylum seekers are giving these things is because once they apply for asylum,
569360	573200	they are essentially in the custody of the government in which they're applying to.
573200	578880	When a government takes a person into custody, it's expected to provide them food and shelter.
578880	584600	This is truly basic stuff, and Lauren's response to the idea that people the government takes
584600	588320	into custody should be given food and shelter is f*** you!
588320	593480	I wonder if she could be so brazen to say this to some of the refugee children currently
593480	597520	staying in Mexico after fleeing their homes in Central America.
597520	601600	You know the exact people the original article she mentioned was discussing?
601600	605520	The people who are fleeing gang violence and who are often the target?
605520	609600	Boys for recruitment, girls for… much worse than that.
609600	614600	When they would come seeking asylum, the idea of giving them food and shelter, Lauren would
614600	615600	say,
615600	616600	F*** you!
616600	617600	Okay.
617600	623720	And frankly, the entire asylum process right now just needs to be revamped.
623720	627600	As it stands, anyone can show up at your board or request asylum.
627600	631440	You have to clothe them, feed them, provide them medical attention, even if you don't
631440	632440	end up letting them in.
632440	633440	Yes.
633440	636000	Yes, you do have to do that.
636000	637000	Absolutely.
637000	641000	If someone applies for asylum and is willing to be taken into the custody of the government
641000	645160	and go through that lengthy process, yes, you do have to provide food and shelter for
645160	646160	them.
646160	649680	There used to be stricter guidelines of who does and does not qualify so you don't end
649680	654720	up with entire countries showing up at your board or demanding to be let in because their
654720	657960	life would be better if they lived in your country.
657960	661060	She seems to think this is something that people will take advantage of.
661060	665480	People will show up at a nation's borders and demand asylum because they really want
665480	670480	to stay locked up in a hotel somewhere for three months or really have much of a life.
670480	674680	Apparently, to her, that seems like something people would swim across the Atlantic Ocean
674680	680040	or fly here just to do that until an entire country shows up, requests asylum so they
680040	682560	can be locked up here for a couple of months.
682560	687280	I don't think the system needs to be revamped for something that isn't happening.
687280	692120	If country A is experiencing mass violence, sectarian warfare, or in general is failing
692120	696440	economically, what do you think moving everyone out of that country and putting them in a
696440	699040	different country is going to do?
699040	700520	Save their lives.
700520	704440	Do you think these people will just start magically behaving differently because their
704440	706080	geography has changed?
706080	710240	Sure, some individuals will be fine and be able to acclimate and succeed, but we're
710240	713760	not talking about individually screening people, are we?
713760	716440	No, we're talking about mass relocation.
716440	718960	We're not talking about resettling individuals.
718960	720880	We're resettling groups.
720880	725400	She seems to think that asylum is something that's granted en masse with no real screening
725400	726400	or vetting.
726400	727960	That's not how it works.
727960	732240	People are screened individually when applying for asylum.
732240	736880	Voting has always been a part of the refugee process, and typically the people who are
736880	741000	causing the problems in that country generally aren't trying to go somewhere else.
741000	747720	No one who's a brutal dictator in, say, Syria, for example, is going to pack up their life,
747720	750840	go live as a refugee in Sweden somewhere.
750840	754440	They're going to continue living on in a place where they can freely oppress and brutalize
754440	755680	the citizenry.
755680	758560	This is about helping people who are trying to escape that.
758560	762440	The fact that she doesn't understand this, the fact that she sees them as, like, parasites
762440	766800	who are coming to suck the resources out of a country, it's truly revolting, and it shows
766800	770440	how little she understands what it means to be a refugee.
770440	774680	What's especially worrying was glancing at the comments section and all the people complaining
774680	777240	about illegal immigration.
777240	780080	Here's one comment that Lauren herself liked.
780080	784240	Dear Lauren, my parents were legal immigrants to the US.
784240	785240	They applied to the US.
785240	788960	They waited the necessary five years and then moved legally to the US.
788960	792960	My parents were DPs in Europe, meaning they had been displaced by the war and could not
792960	796600	go back to their countries at the end of the war because their countries had been overrun
796600	797600	by communists.
797600	800480	I have absolutely no care whatsoever about the illegals.
800480	805400	If they want to come here, legally let them go through the process.
805400	810860	Applying for asylum and being granted refugee status is the legal process.
810860	813800	This is not about illegal immigration.
813800	817000	There are a number of other comments that make references to illegal immigration, and
817000	822080	if I were Lauren, I would be alarmed, alarmed that so many people in my comments are so
822080	823080	misinformed.
823080	827160	They don't even understand what the video is about, but then again, Lauren doesn't even
827160	830800	understand what she's talking about, so it's not a surprise that her viewers are similarly
830800	832720	misinformed.
832720	834600	It really depresses me.
834600	838160	Refugees are some of the most vulnerable people in the world.
838160	843360	When I see this sort of nonsense being pushed against them, it makes me really angry, and
843360	846960	I probably sound more sad than angry right now because I've had a couple of hours to
846960	852460	cool off, write this little script out in a bit of a fury, and now I just feel kind
852460	853860	of sad.
853860	859740	Sad to think how campaigning like this reduces the number of refugees who are, again, granted
859740	865140	that specific status and are being turned away because there's all this misinformation
865140	869140	from people who really have no interest in allowing others in.
869140	873340	These are the sentiments that leads to overcrowding in refugee camps because the native population
873800	875400	sees them as a threat.
875400	881940	These are the words and ideas that create this fiction that refugees are a danger and
881940	887140	are likely to cause crime and trouble in their host nations, something the stats don't really
887140	889300	support.
889300	891220	I want us to do better than this.
891220	902060	We can do better than these ideas, these sentiments, and I hope one day we will.
902060	903700	So this video is a bit of a venting.
903700	906260	Again, I wasn't planning on making this video.
906260	910580	I'm doing this one very quickly because I'm in the midst of a very large project.
910580	914720	It's another deep dive into another video about refugees.
914720	917100	This video is already longer than I expected.
917100	920280	I just want to close it up by thanking all my patrons.
920280	924100	Their names are on the screen, and they are some truly lovely people.
924100	928860	If you would like to be as wonderful as those patrons, you can head over to my Patreon and
928860	931900	donate whatever you're comfortable with, whatever is in your means.
931900	937180	Please don't go hungry on account of giving me money, but I do appreciate every little
937180	942380	bit someone can spare me because these videos are a labor of love, and it takes a bit of
942380	947000	time out of my life to produce them, and I appreciate everyone who watches them.
947000	949680	Everyone who subscribes, likes, leaves a comment.
949680	952700	I do this for all of you, and I hope it's appreciated.
952700	956020	And if it's not, I don't know, go watch a Lauren Chen video.
956020	957620	No, don't watch that.
957620	958620	Go outside.
958620	959620	Live.
959620	960620	Enjoy your life.
960620	964220	I understand that there are people out there sitting in refugee camps who could be resettled
964220	966940	to a nation, and enjoy a life as well.
966940	971820	If only it weren't for demagogues like Lauren Chen speaking out against them.
971820	972420	Thanks for watching.
