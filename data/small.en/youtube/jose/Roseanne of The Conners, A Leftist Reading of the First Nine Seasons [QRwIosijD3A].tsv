0	5040	In March of 2018, the Roseanne TV series was revived for a tenth season,
5040	10080	picking up the exploits of the Connor family 20 years after the series' original finale.
10080	13840	We all know what happened a few months later. Roseanne made a racist tweet,
13840	18480	the show was immediately cancelled, and we were dragged into a hail of anger and fury.
18480	22960	What was lost in the noise, though, was the show itself, and for all the outreach over Roseanne
22960	27600	being fired, there wasn't much discussion about the tenth season of her show and what it was all
27600	32560	about, or what the preceding nine seasons were about for that matter. Roseanne was a free speech
32560	37280	martyr for the right, despite starring in a show that had much to say from the left.
37280	40880	I think it's important to acknowledge that a TV show is a collaborative effort,
40880	44640	comprising the work of hundreds of people. While you can't discount the person who
44640	49360	is divorced behind it, you also can't treat the two as synonymous. That said,
49360	53120	I can't completely discount the words and actions of Roseanne Barr,
53120	55920	specifically when it comes to how she put her show together.
55920	60080	So if you enjoy watching someone wrestle with whether or not art can be untangled from the
60080	62240	artist, you're going to have some fun in this video.
68480	74080	This story starts back in the late 1980s. The Roseanne show started as the vague idea of a
74080	79440	series starring a working-class woman from producers Marcy Carsey and Tom Wartner. The
79440	83360	pair had recently helped create the Cosby Show for NBC. They planned on creating this
83360	88320	working-class series with a writer from the Cosby Show, Matt Williams, this time for rival network
88320	94000	ABC. At the same time, one of the hottest rising stars in the stand-up comedy world was a woman
94000	99600	named Roseanne Barr. Originally from Salt Lake City, she began a career performing stand-up across
99600	104800	Colorado, drawing from her life as a wife and mother of three children. Often referring to
104800	110800	herself as a domestic goddess, Barr's work was charged with a fighting attitude that immediately
110800	115920	made her a star. A tape of her stand-up found its way into the hands of Mitzi Shore, owner of the
115920	121520	fabled Los Angeles Comedy Club, the Comedy Store. Roseanne Barr's appearance at the Comedy Store
121520	127120	led to an appearance on The Tonight Show, a national tour, and an HBO special. Barr was the
127120	132880	perfect fit for the new Carsey Wartner sitcom. This all happened in the space of about five years.
132880	136800	And so the Roseanne show was born. Almost.
140800	148320	One of the inescapable facts about talking about the Roseanne show is that you cannot escape
148320	154240	talking about the backstage drama, and it began even before the first episode aired. The first
154240	160240	major conflict was between Roseanne Barr and writer Matt Williams. Originally, the first draft
160240	166320	for the pilot episode was for a show titled Life and Stuff, which focused on the stories of three
166320	172160	women. A married woman with kids, a divorced woman with a kid, and a childless single woman,
172160	177920	all working at a factory in Indiana, something taken from Williams's personal background.
177920	182560	When Barr entered the project, she reshaped the series entirely, including changing the name of
182560	188000	the series to Roseanne, and having her character, the married woman with children, be the focal
188000	193200	point for the series. According to Barr, the reason Williams hadn't made her the star of the series was
193200	198160	because Williams had told her, I just don't think people would like you as the main character.
198720	203760	Speaking to the LA Times in 1989, Williams gave full credit to Roseanne Barr for the character
203760	208160	Roseanne Connor, who she played on the show. He also credits her with bringing a feminist
208160	212960	perspective to the series, but the official credit for creating the show, as decided by
212960	219280	the Screenwriters Guild, would still go to Williams. This infuriated Barr. The pilot was
219280	224240	rewritten with the series now named Roseanne, and Life and Stuff was dropped to the episode
224240	228640	title, and Roseanne Connor would be the focus of the show now, with the other two women being
228640	234480	devoted to the supporting cast as her sister Jackie and friend Crystal. An unproven actress,
234480	239760	the producers chose to surround Roseanne Barr with experienced actors. Although Barr had originally
239760	244560	wanted her comedian friend Tom Arnold to play her husband on the show, the role was instead given
244560	249680	to John Goodman. The chemistry between Goodman and Barr was instantaneous, and he was chosen
249680	255840	to be Dan Connor within moments of his audition beginning. I pump those brakes to make sure they
255840	262720	grab. If they don't grab, I ruin the guy in front of me. I get a ticket. Our insurance premiums go
262720	268480	up. We go broke trying to pay them. Our children end up in a poor house. We starve. That's why I
268480	274000	pump the brakes. Okay, well, just tell me one thing. What? Why do you pump the brakes?
282240	283120	You know, Rosie.
285600	291600	The pair had instant chemistry, and the character of Dan Connor was born. Another major addition
291600	297120	to the cast was Laurie Metcalf, chosen for the role of Jackie Harris, Roseanne Connor's sister.
297200	301520	In a cast of talented actors, Metcalf was the only one to win multiple Emmys,
301520	307920	with three wins for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series from 1992 to 1994.
307920	313200	The Connor family was completed with Alicia Lacey Gorenson as eldest daughter Becky,
313200	317920	Sarah Gilbert as middle child Darlene, and Michael Fishman as the youngest Connor kid,
317920	323840	David Jacob, or DJ. A few regulars would join the cast, such as Roseanne's friend Crystal,
323840	329600	played by Natalie West, and Roseanne's sometimes boss and Jackie's sometimes romantic interest,
329600	335600	Booker Brooks, played by George Clooney. Yes, that George Clooney. At the center of this cast
335600	340480	was Roseanne Barr, playing Roseanne Connor, an abrasive working-class woman who held her family
340480	347680	together with love, humor, and grit. I'll do everything else like I always do. I'll have to
347680	351600	get off work an hour early, lose an hour's pay, totally rearrange my whole schedule,
354080	360480	but I don't mind. Unlike sitcoms of an earlier era, this wasn't a household run by a father who
360480	365040	knew best, but a mother who knew better, and the first episode set the stage for a series that
365040	369920	would bring an American audience new perspectives on the working class, feminism, and what it meant
370000	377840	to fight for everything you've got. A guy is a lump like this donut. Okay, so first you gotta
377840	386320	get rid of all the stuff his mom did to him. And then you gotta get rid of all that macho crap
386320	393440	that they pick up from the beer commercial. And then there's my personal favorite, the male ego.
393440	402960	The first episode establishes our working-class family, and from the very beginning you can tell
402960	409040	this won't be like other shows. Roseanne isn't this sweet, put-together mother of other sitcoms.
409040	415440	She's loud, has a sharp tongue, and is rather heavy set. In other words, she's the exact sort
415440	420880	of person you wouldn't expect to see as the star of a primetime sitcom. Roseanne Connor works full
420880	425200	time in a plastics factory, but her second shift starts when she gets home, holding together her
425200	430480	household as a working mother. Her husband, Dan, doesn't do much to help out around the house when
430480	435600	he's off work from his struggling drywalling business. The kids are loud, bratty, and talk
435600	442480	back to their parents. In 2018, this isn't particularly groundbreaking stuff, but in 1988
442480	448000	this was far less common. Families were happy little units on TV, like you might see on shows
448000	453600	such as Full House or Growing Pains. On those shows, the teasing was gentler, and parents didn't
453600	458640	treat their kids like annoying brats. Perhaps most importantly, we were being invited to laugh
458640	464240	alongside the Conners, rather than at them, as an audience might do instead to other shows depicting
464240	468960	the working class, such as Married with Children. And look at the aesthetics of this show. The
468960	473840	Conners dress poorly, their food is shitty, and their furniture doesn't match. These aren't the
473840	478320	proper homes you might see on other shows depicting a happy middle class. These are firmly
478320	483200	working class people. In the first episode we get a sense of what money means to the Connor clan
483200	490400	when Darlene gets in trouble for barking in class. Your daughter barks. Our whole family barks!
491920	497040	Roseanne has to plead with Booker for some time off, and when she does loses part of her paycheck.
497040	502480	To the Conners, money is always a major concern. Not for luxuries or greed, but to pay for the
502560	507200	basics of what they need to survive. The struggle of holding the family together has real consequences
507200	511840	too, as Roseanne and Dan constantly argue from gentle teasing to full-on fights.
511840	532960	But the episode closes with Darlene getting hurt, and both parents springing to action to help her.
532960	537280	This encapsulates so much of what the show is about, a working class family being stretched
537280	541360	thin by economic demands, only held together by the love they have for one another.
541360	545760	The Conners have to hold on to each other to survive in a society where working class people,
545760	551840	and women in particular, are being worked to the bone. It's a damning critique of 1980s America,
551840	558080	and in 2018 it still holds some resonance. By the end of its first season, it would be the second
558080	563440	highest rated show on television, right behind the Cosby Show. The feminism of the first season is
563440	568400	also in sharp display, particularly the episode Nightmare on Oak Street, which featured what has
568400	574160	now become a sitcom cliché, Darlene getting her first period. An especially interesting choice,
574160	579040	considering Darlene was very much the tomboy of the family, and this step into womanhood created
579040	583920	a struggle with how she saw herself and how the world expected her to behave as a woman.
598400	610400	We even get some pushback against toxic masculinity in the episode
610400	616000	Dan's Birthday Bash, where Roseanne demands Dan not get into a fight with some asshole at a bar
616000	637760	on his birthday. Roseanne and Dan end up having a frank conversation about getting older
637760	640640	and a vision of manhood that doesn't involve fighting people.
646000	666320	I really liked how in this episode, Roseanne's birthday gift to Dan is an anchor. The symbolism
666320	670880	would be damning if it weren't for the fact that the anchor is for Dan's pet project, building a
670880	676560	boat in their garage. A superficial reading here has the anchor tying Dan down and limiting his
676560	681760	freedom, but a deeper understanding shows you that this anchor is in some ways what Dan has always
681760	687280	wanted. A disappointing twist to this episode, and one of the first real signs that this show
687280	692640	is of its time, is that Dan ends up going back to the bar towards the end of the episode and
692640	698480	beating up the asshole anyway. His violence is a product of its time, and an example of how,
698480	703760	as progressive as Roseanne was, it's still a show from 30 years ago, and there are certain
703760	709440	artifacts that don't age well. Here's another example. In the episode Lovers Lane, Booker and
709440	717200	Jackie have a friendly bet. If I win, then you have to spend the night in my place. What if you win?
718320	724080	Then you spend the night in my place. Sounds good. Scrubbing my bathroom.
724080	732160	Alright, whatever gets you in the mood. Is that a bet? Yeah. Yeah.
732160	736800	I assume Booker means he wants to have sex with Jackie and not stay up reading the Bible together.
736800	740560	The episode makes it clear that they're both attracted to each other, but we still
740560	746800	get these vaguely, to be honest, rapey vibes. Would you really want me there against my will?
746800	755360	Absolutely. Booker does redeem himself. Not on a bet. Not tonight, and not on a bet.
762000	766400	But it's still not the sort of thing I'd imagine many guys saying while flirting with someone.
766400	772720	Not a guy who isn't a complete scumbag. As we'll see even more pointedly as we go through the
772720	777200	series, Roseanne is a show that does a lot of good things, but never completely escapes the
777200	782720	context of its time. And for a modern audience to appreciate it, or get anything out of it,
782720	787440	it's important to keep that in mind. While halfway through the first season,
787440	792240	the show seemed to be sailing along smoothly, behind the scenes things were starting to reach
792240	796480	a breaking point. While filming the fourth episode, Roseanne Barr was outraged that her
796480	801360	wardrobe requests were the only ones being ignored. According to Barr herself, she took a
801360	806000	pair of scissors, went to one of the producers responsible, and threatened her saying,
806000	811920	Bitch, do you want me to cut you? Barr also kept a prominently displayed list in her office that
811920	817120	had a title reading, These are the people who are going to be fired if they're not nice to me.
817120	824160	People who I am the boss of. Everybody. All producers, all writers, all subject to change.
824960	830480	She updated the list regularly. Roseanne Barr and writer Matt Williams continued to feud behind the
830480	836000	scenes, with Barr often refusing to read lines. Barr gave the executive producers an ultimatum.
836000	842640	It was her or Williams. One of them had to go. An agreement was reached with Williams,
842640	849600	and by episode 13, he left the show forever. One of the ideas credited to Williams was the setting
849600	854880	of a plastics factory, where Roseanne, Jackie, and Crystal worked. This artifact of his tenure
854880	860160	would only last until the end of the first season, but not before providing a great season finale.
860640	867120	In Let's Call It Quits, tensions at the workplace boil over when Booker is replaced by Keith Faber,
867120	872800	a hard-ass boss played by former diehard villain and Republican presidential nominee hopeful,
872800	877760	Fred Thompson. He not only applies harsh work quotas, he also picks on his employees.
878560	881680	Will you hold this for a minute? Honey, I'm not here to hold.
882720	889040	I'm here to supervise. And in particular, he wants to break Roseanne Connor.
889840	895200	Now, my brother has this dairy farm. You know, some of those cows take the
895760	897760	milk and ride off. Some of them take a little longer.
899600	904080	Every once in a while, you run across a real stubborn. But you know what?
905360	908880	Sooner or later, they all give milk.
911360	915680	Eventually, Faber breaks Roseanne, getting her to agree to show him some respect
915680	917600	in exchange for lower work quotas.
945680	958000	Yes. Yes, what?
959120	960080	Yes, we have a deal.
960080	966400	Sir.
976000	978240	But quotas still go back up.
979280	981920	So what are you raising our quotas to?
981920	986000	Nothing you girls can't handle. We're going to try 8,000 again.
986160	990320	And I have every confidence that you girls can cut the mustard.
990960	993920	And if you can't, then nice working with you.
994960	1000240	In the final scene of the season, not counting a post-credits scene, Roseanne leads a walkout.
1001120	1002320	You okay, sis?
1002320	1007840	No, I'm not okay. I mean, I tried to be okay, but he doesn't want me to be okay.
1007840	1011200	He doesn't want any of us to be okay. You know why? Because he's not okay.
1012240	1014480	Roseanne, I told you not to walk away from me.
1015040	1018320	I'm walking away from you, Faber, and I'm walking away from the stick of the factory.
1018320	1020160	I'm walking away from this lousy job.
1022400	1024960	Well, that was a wonderful performance, Roseanne.
1025520	1029760	But if any of you are considering joining her, may I point out there are two doors to this room,
1030480	1034800	one that pays and one that doesn't.
1044480	1073840	I guess we're not going to make our quota today.
1073840	1081200	Honey Bunch.
1082240	1087280	Roseanne quitting, on her own, would have meant little, but a massive movement of workers
1087280	1095200	standing together in solidarity? That sounds like the beginning of a real political change.
1099040	1101920	In season two, Tom Arnold joined the show as a writer.
1102480	1105680	The controversial decision didn't sit well with the other writers,
1105680	1108000	who were told to teach him how to write a sitcom.
1108640	1111440	Safford Vila, a writer for the show at the time, says,
1112080	1115680	We all thought he was 100% talent free.
1116960	1121760	Arnold was Barr's man on the inside, as Barr didn't spend too much time in the writer's room,
1121760	1125600	and she was worried the writers would push her show in a direction she didn't like.
1125600	1129520	Barr would have a contentious relationship with her writing staff throughout the show's run.
1129600	1133680	In Vila's mind, it was really just fighting for power in the voice of the show.
1134320	1138400	This is also the season the show hit number one in the ratings.
1138400	1141360	After Roseanne Connor left her job at the Plastics Factory,
1141360	1144720	she took another selling magazine subscriptions over the phone.
1144720	1147200	She also briefly worked in a salon.
1147200	1152640	The salon job led Roseanne to confront her boss's boss from the first season, Mrs. Wellman,
1152640	1156000	the owner of the Plastics Factory Roseanne once worked at.
1156000	1159440	Mrs. Wellman can't even be bothered to remember Roseanne's name.
1159440	1162480	The two really collide, if you'll excuse the pun,
1162480	1167120	in an episode titled Fenderbender, where Mrs. Wellman hits Roseanne with her car.
1186000	1196880	The Connor family is quick to review their legal options,
1196880	1202240	but the only lawyer they can afford is apparently this hapless loser played by Stephen Root.
1203040	1206480	In response to a legal threat, Mrs. Wellman tries to buy her way out.
1216800	1221520	Mrs. Wellman effectively avoids any threat from the law because she can afford a better attorney.
1221520	1225280	Once again, the working class are shown at a disadvantage in a system that supposedly
1225280	1229360	protects them. The two-tiered justice system is a difficult concept to unpack,
1229360	1233440	but in 20 minutes you can see this little TV episode explain it clearly.
1233440	1235440	I also want to highlight this little line.
1235440	1240880	Even though you no longer work for the company, we still think of you as part of the Wellman family.
1241600	1243920	I don't suppose my health insurance is still good.
1246880	1249200	Roseanne needs medical insurance.
1249200	1252960	The fact that someone hitting you with a car leaves you with a bill is cruel.
1252960	1262880	The symbolism of it being her former boss who treated her like garbage can't be understated.
1267440	1271840	Producer for the show Tom Warner arranged to have Roseanne Barr sing the national anthem
1271840	1286720	at a San Diego Padres game on July 25th, 1990. This is what it sounded like.
1286720	1304560	People were unimpressed. There was enough backlash to get Barr to stop touring,
1304560	1310480	and the president of the United States, George H.W. Bush, called it disgraceful. Although the
1310480	1314960	national anthem disaster would have slowed down other shows, that wasn't the case for season 3.
1314960	1319280	It premiered with strong ratings, continuing the trend of being viewed by over 20 million
1319280	1324560	Americans every week, and like a virgin, the topic of sexuality and birth control comes up.
1344960	1354320	It's a difficult subject to talk about, not just because it's centered on sex,
1354320	1357360	but because it's specifically about female sexuality.
1374960	1397360	Why do women feel the need to downplay their sexual history around men?
1397360	1402560	The opposite is rarely true. It speaks to the old-fashioned attitudes of Roseanne and Dan's
1402560	1403840	generation.
1432560	1455440	This is a nice demonstration of how social change isn't something that happens overnight,
1455440	1461520	but rather is a generational thing. On the theme of teenage sex, season 3 also sees the introduction
1461680	1468960	of Mark, played by Glenn Quinn in Becky, Beds, and Boys. This episode also establishes Roseanne's
1468960	1474640	new job, working as a waitress at a mall restaurant. Season 3 also introduced Leon,
1474640	1479840	Roseanne's boss at the restaurant played by Martin Mall, and the episode Dances with Darlene,
1479840	1482000	we find out something interesting about Leon.
1491520	1510400	Although he's certainly not the first gay character to appear on a sitcom,
1510400	1515520	Leon is one of the few who wasn't a cheap stereotype. Back in season 2, the episode
1515520	1520960	Born to Be Wild introduced an old friend of Dan and Roseanne, Ziggy, played by J.O. Sanders.
1527040	1531040	It was a good episode where Dan and Roseanne confront the rebellious past and see how they've
1531040	1536160	been fit into their less-dramatic present. It ends with Ziggy helping Dan restore his old bike.
1536720	1541280	Roseanne and Dan holding onto their past in some ways explains what informs this show,
1541280	1546000	the rebellion of the 60s, and activism that, at the time of the show's airing,
1546000	1551280	is already 20 years behind the times. This isn't to say something still can't be learned,
1551280	1556880	but the romance of the past can create blind spots for the present. Ziggy embodies a romanticized
1556880	1561520	version of their past. In season 3, Ziggy makes a return with an opportunity for the present.
1571280	1581360	With some of Ziggy's backing and a second mortgage on the house,
1581360	1584160	it looks like it's going to happen, but Ziggy gets cold feet.
1601280	1614240	Ziggy, in this episode, is a counterpoint to what I said earlier about romanticizing the past.
1614240	1618320	He's shown to be a coward. He lacks the maturity that can make a dream attainable,
1618320	1622400	even if he does stumble into the means. The friendship ends poorly.
1631280	1644880	And while Dan doesn't want to give up on his dream, even if he has to do it solo,
1644880	1650240	the economic reality of his situation is that even risking everything isn't risking enough.
1650800	1655040	This isn't the only time we've seen the Conners want to roll the dice for a better future,
1655040	1659280	but a running theme of this series is that working class people can be screwed over by
1659280	1664240	the many sad facts of their realities, many of them not of their own making. But maybe not this
1664240	1668720	time. During the credits Darlene finds an envelope on the fridge, Ziggy's share of the investment
1668720	1674400	money gifted to his former friend. It's a sweet gesture, and one that gives Dan the chance to
1674400	1679840	chase his dream in the next season. How exactly do other working class people get an angel investor
1679840	1684720	like this? Although that's kind of a useless question because this blessing will just give
1684720	1688640	us further lessons on why it sucks to be working class in America.
1694000	1698080	One of the major threads through season four is Darlene's battle with depression.
1698080	1704000	In the season's fourth episode, Darlene fades to black, we're greeted with a despondent Darlene,
1704000	1710160	shed of her tomboyish persona, and instead now a couch-dwelling misanthrope. What's telling about
1710160	1716320	this is that there's no trauma, no sudden major life event, no crippling moment of realization.
1717040	1719760	We just see Darlene, and she's depressed.
1730320	1734240	Rosanne and Dan are at a loss on how to cope with her daughter's new depression.
1740160	1752400	The episode ends without any touching family moment or chance for Darlene to recover.
1752400	1757680	Depression isn't solved so easily. This is yet another way the Rosanne show departed from other
1757680	1763120	sitcoms. Problems weren't solved at the end of every episode. Things didn't always magically
1763120	1769200	get better with a heart-to-heart conversation with a loving parent. In this episode, mental
1769200	1774800	illness and invisible invader shows up in their lives, and they're completely incapable of handling
1774800	1790160	it. By the next episode, Darlene seems to be somewhat back to normal.
1790160	1797440	But the black clothes she started wearing remain.
1798160	1802720	Much like the way depression works in real life, there are good days and there are bad ones.
1803520	1809600	A few episodes later, Thanksgiving 91, Darlene has a bad day. We get a few touching scenes that
1809600	1813920	show how Darlene's parents are still reaching out to her. They won't give up on their daughter.
1820560	1849360	Confronted with Darlene's pain, we see what any
1849360	1854480	parents would do. They try to comfort her in any way they can, but perhaps more telling is how
1854480	1860320	ill-equipped they are to do it. The word depression is rarely used in these episodes, as if the
1860320	1866160	vocabulary of mental illness is out of their reach. In later episodes, this period in Darlene's life
1866160	1877520	would be referred to as her mood. For a working class family like the Connors, they literally
1877520	1883280	don't have the language to explain Darlene's problem. It may be generational, a class issue,
1883280	1888400	or just an overall social ignorance about depression in 1991, but it's another sign
1888400	1892160	of how the Connors are out of touch with what their kids need in a modern world.
1892720	1897920	But it isn't for a lack of caring, but rather a painful reality of the limitations of what it
1897920	1902800	means to be a parent and how being working class makes parenting that much harder. They can't
1902800	1908320	afford to send Darlene to a therapist or fall back on some sort of post-secondary education
1908320	1913200	to inform them of what's happening. They have to make do with what they've got, and what they've
1913200	1919840	got, sadly, isn't quite enough. Although he was called Kevin in his first appearance, the episode
1919840	1925520	The Bowling Show brought Johnny Galecki into the cast as Mark's younger brother, eventually named
1925520	1930240	David. He would go on to be a major player, not just in Darlene's life as a love interest,
1930240	1935440	but in the Connor household in general. Season four ends with the episode Aliens,
1935440	1940880	which brings with it a reckoning on the challenges of being a working class parent in the early 90s.
1940880	1945040	More so than the struggles with their daughters' sex lives and mental health, the Connors have
1945040	1949760	always struggled with providing for their family. While the Connor kids can expect the basics of
1949760	1953520	food, clothing, and shelter, what about the opportunity to have a better life than their
1953520	1959280	parents? The two main threads of this episode are DJ competing in, and eventually winning,
1959280	1965360	a spelling bee. And the other, more important one is Dan's bike shop, funded at the end of season
1965360	1971280	three, is now shutting down. Dan just couldn't get it to work out, and Becky is learning the ugly
1971280	1979200	truth. Please tell me there's a college fund. Well, there was, but... So even if I get into
1979200	1988640	these schools, I can't afford to go? Becky, it has been a really bad year. I can't believe this.
1988640	1993840	I mean, we may not have exactly been able to spoil her, but she still had it pretty good.
1995520	2001600	As good as we wanted her to. The episode tries to wrap things up in a happy ending of sorts,
2001600	2007120	but season five won't be leaving this thread alone. And perhaps the one true victory of this
2007120	2012640	episode, the credits scene features the character Arnie being abducted by aliens, forever ensuring
2012640	2017600	that Tom Arnold will not appear on the show. I've spared you clips of this guy as much as I could
2017600	2022400	throughout this video, but this marks a good fucking riddance to the worst part of the Rose
2022400	2029040	Dan show. The man was a comedy black hole, sucking in any and all humor that surrounded him into an
2029040	2039520	endless, unfunny void of misery. Season five opens up with terms of estrangement, a two-parter that's
2039520	2044880	one of my favorites. Dan is forced to close down his bike shop, proving that dream of pulling
2044880	2049680	yourself up by your own bootstraps is an illusion. Your mother and I have decided to close the bike
2049680	2056480	shop. We're going on a business sale and locking the doors on Friday. And I don't have a job,
2056480	2061760	so that means no income. When Dan has to fire Becky's boyfriend, Mark, who had been helping
2061760	2066800	at the shop, Mark quickly lands on his feet and is offered a new job. Only it's in another state,
2066800	2073600	which means he would have to leave Becky. This leads to a scene where Becky tears Dan to fucking
2073600	2075600	pieces.
2103600	2126720	The episode ends with Becky and Mark running off to Minnesota to elope.
2127600	2132080	The next episode picks up with Becky returning home to pick up her belongings. Since leaving
2132080	2134720	home, Dan has been unable to speak to his daughter.
2162080	2185840	But it isn't that Dan is mad at Becky so much as that he's upset with himself.
2192080	2221680	The episode ends with Becky departing, but instead of that last minute tearful goodbye,
2222080	2227840	Dan can't bear to face his daughter. Once again we don't get an easy resolution,
2227840	2232160	and there is a heavy emphasis on parents failing their children. In this case,
2232160	2236320	it's Dan being unable to provide for his daughter because he took a gamble and tried to start a
2236320	2242240	business. While a crueler interpretation would say Dan is a bad businessman and deserves failure,
2242240	2247280	the real question is, does Becky deserve to be punished because of that? Does a thoughtful,
2247280	2251920	academically successful young woman not deserve the chance to better her life with a higher
2251920	2258160	education because her father made a bad business decision? Rich people make bad business decisions
2258160	2263680	every day, sometimes losing more money in a day than Dan Connor lost in the year he ran his bike
2263680	2269520	shop. They can afford to screw up. Dan Connor can't. This illustrates the bind of the working
2269520	2273840	class that even when you have the chance to make something of your life, if you make a mistake,
2273840	2277520	you don't just let yourself down, you could potentially let your whole family down.
2278400	2282000	Dan and Becky patching things up was inevitable. They had a good relationship,
2282000	2287840	not so easily discarded over a failure. But will Becky's life ever recover? Will she be able to
2287840	2292160	go back to school and make something of the future she dreamed of herself? We won't be finding out
2292160	2297760	for a while because in season 5, Alicia Gorinson, the actress who played Becky, left the show.
2297760	2301280	The reason for Gorinson's departure was not, as you might have guessed,
2301280	2306000	fleeing in terror from Roseanne. She went to pursue an education at Vassar College,
2306000	2310640	although the Becky Connor character wouldn't exactly leave the show with Gorinson's departure,
2310640	2315920	but more on that in season 6. Season 5 brought with it one last major employment change for
2315920	2321280	Roseanne Connor. In looking for loans in all the wrong places, Roseanne, Jackie, and their friend
2321280	2326800	Nancy, played by Sandra Bernhardt, open a diner serving loose meat sandwiches. While that might
2326800	2331680	seem outrageous, coming off the heels of Dan having to sell his bike shop, the money for starting
2331680	2336880	the business mostly comes from Roseanne and Jackie's mother, Bev, played by Estelle Parsons.
2336880	2341280	It's a small crime, I haven't mentioned her until now. She had been playing Beverly Harris
2341280	2345680	in special guest spots since season 1. She never quite becomes a regular member of the cast,
2345680	2349840	but she's a constant figure, appearing in several episodes throughout each season.
2361680	2376480	Through a combination of a gift and a loan, Roseanne is able to start a business of her own.
2376480	2380720	This is yet another chance afforded the Conners to make more of their situation. I don't want to
2380720	2385040	dive too much into this episode, but it's telling that the opportunities the Conners get to reshape
2385040	2390080	their lives often come from external help, almost as if the show is saying that the only way working
2390080	2395120	class people can get out of their situation is with some help from the outside, rather than the
2395120	2401120	whole fabled bootstrap method that has already been thoroughly undermined in earlier episodes.
2401120	2407280	A major plotline in season 5 is the introduction of Fisher. The name even gives me chills now.
2407280	2411360	Played by Matt Roth, the eventual real-life husband of Laurie Metcalf,
2411360	2416160	Fisher was introduced as Jackie's love interest in the episode titled Mommy Nearest.
2416160	2424640	All we really know about Fisher at first is that he's young.
2424640	2428560	The truth about Fisher comes out halfway through the season in Crime and Punishment, and as a
2428560	2434240	content warning, these next few scenes include some very wrenching depictions of an abuse victim,
2434240	2437440	so fair warning that you might want to skip ahead to the time written below.
2438160	2441920	One afternoon, when Jackie arrives at Roseanne's house to go out for dinner,
2441920	2446640	after Roseanne urges Jackie to change her shirt, her bruises are discovered by Darlene.
2454960	2456000	And the truth comes out.
2471920	2473520	You don't understand.
2501920	2527360	When Dan learns the truth, he takes action and faces the consequences.
2532880	2542320	It's interesting to contrast the reactions of Dan and Roseanne.
2542880	2546400	Roseanne's impulse is to care for her sister and get her to a hospital.
2547760	2550320	Dan's impulse is to beat the shit out of Fisher.
2551520	2553840	The following episode, War and Peace,
2553840	2557680	sees Dan getting out of jail where he's confronted by a confused Jackie.
2561920	2581760	This moment displays the struggle within Jackie, desperate for support, but not the kind Dan offers
2581760	2587280	her. She feels shame, confusion, and sadness in a way that makes the situation so hard for her to
2587280	2590640	process. She later considers going back to Fisher.
2591360	2618480	Jackie and Fisher eventually meet,
2619360	2621360	when another awful truth comes out.
2621360	2649280	And in what is the most important part of the episode, Jackie is faced with a decision.
2651360	2669200	These episodes speak so clearly on their own,
2669200	2673040	but I want to highlight the difference between the various reactions to helping Jackie.
2673040	2678560	Roseanne and Dan do what they can, as best they can in their own ways, but ultimately,
2678560	2683360	it's a story about how Jackie finds the real power to solve her problems. It speaks to how often
2683360	2687120	the best way to help someone out of an abusive relationship isn't to fight their battles for
2687120	2692560	them, but to support and empower them so they can make the right choices. Done poorly, this episode
2692560	2697120	could have just been Jackie having to pull herself up by her bootstraps and stand up to an abusive
2697120	2701040	asshole, but instead we get a story of a victim who needs some port from those around her so she
2701040	2705440	can make a positive change in her life. It's precisely why instead of blaming victims for
2705440	2710640	getting into their situations or not being able to fix them, it's more productive to empower them
2710640	2715840	so they can actually make a change in their life for the better. In the middle of season 5, feeding
2715840	2720880	the monster, A Week in the Life of Roseanne aired on the BBC in the UK. It was a behind-the-scenes
2720880	2726320	look at the production of The Roseanne Show. If we had any doubt on whether or not this is a
2726320	2728720	left-wing show, here's a telling clip.
2735840	2742080	Left also. That's true. That's very true. And there they were left out. Yeah, left and left out.
2742080	2747920	All unemployed guys. We also get a sense of what Roseanne thinks of her own show. And it's not
2747920	2753840	only anti-television, it's totally anti-media and then they don't get that neither because that's
2753840	2758960	who they are until finally I'm talking about television itself which I did last in last week's
2758960	2763360	episode that aired, which I thought was great. I was actually talking about the horrible things
2763360	2768880	television has taught my generation and I'm doing it on television. I just think that's great.
2769520	2773680	And perhaps more importantly, there's this revealing clip with one of the show's writers.
2786320	2790560	And whenever I think of what Roseanne might think of this video I'm making right now,
2790560	2811520	I think of this moment. As season five closes, there is another exit on the show
2811520	2816480	in Daughters and Other Strangers. In contrast to Becky settling down with a new husband
2816480	2820080	and giving up on her dreams of college, Darlene is going to Chicago to attempt
2820080	2823520	to make something more of her life, something Roseanne can't refuse her.
2846480	2857120	This is the infamous season where writers had to start wearing shirts with numbers printed on them.
2857120	2862240	Instead of referring to them by their name, Roseanne Barr would call out their numbers instead.
2862240	2866720	None of the writers who worked on the show spoke fondly of this new management strategy.
2867360	2873040	This season also saw Sarah Gilbert going to Yale. Although unlike Gorinson, she remained a part of
2873040	2877520	the show. Apparently Barr thought she was so essential that a special set was made near Yale
2877520	2882080	so Gilbert could film her scenes speaking to various characters over the phone. She would
2882080	2886960	appear with the rest of the cast in a handful of episodes and as a result never officially
2886960	2892960	left the cast. This season brought with it two very controversial episodes with scenes that were
2892960	2897440	at the time completely shocking. There's no need for a content warning though,
2897440	2902160	unless your mind is easily blown by how conservative television was in the 1990s.
2902880	2909040	The first, a stash from the past, is about, as you might have guessed, marijuana. Roseanne finds
2909040	2915200	what she thinks is David's stash, only to later be reminded by Dan that it's actually hers.
2921680	2925120	Roseanne, Dan and Jackie then proceed to smoke up.
2932160	2939840	The most wonderful, beautiful, sexy, you know, thing.
2941440	2949840	Somehow, this ranked as number 21 on TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of Television in 1997.
2949840	2955280	It's a great example of time capsule activism where a truly groundbreaking act is rather
2955280	2960880	mundane by today's standards. But really, I only bring up this episode in the context of the next
2960880	2965200	one, which had a controversial moment that was a lot more than some middle-aged people getting
2965200	2970640	high. In Don't Ask, Don't Tell, Roseanne is directly confronted on her supposedly pro-gay
2970640	2975520	stance when it gets right up in her face. Literally, when a friend of Nancy's kisses her...
2982240	2986000	Although the kiss grabbed all the headlines, this episode was about more than that.
2986000	2990400	Roseanne has to confront the anxiety she now has when being gay is something she has to wonder
2990400	2994000	about herself. It leads to an important realization at the end.
2994000	2998000	And you're afraid that just one little tiny percent of you might have been turned on by a woman.
3001040	3006960	That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard. I am not afraid of any small percentage of
3006960	3014640	my gay-ness inside, you know what I mean? I am totally okay about whether I'm like
3014640	3022480	three percent or four percent or lower. While an unexpected kiss can be considered sexual assault,
3022480	3027120	this episode sidesteps the issue by making it non-threatening and uses it as a metaphor,
3027680	3031360	forcing Roseanne to really test how accepting she is of being gay.
3031360	3032720	I am not gay!
3032720	3044560	I didn't mean for that to sound like it was bad or anything, you know, because if I was gay,
3044560	3049440	that'd be just fine, but I'm not gay. So I just don't like people calling me things that I'm not,
3049440	3052800	like a hypocrite. I'm not gonna admit I was wrong or anything,
3052800	3056880	but I just don't want to fight with you anymore, so I was wrong. Thank you.
3057760	3060720	She realizes she's still uncomfortable with it deep down somewhere,
3060720	3064960	revealing a degree of homophobia she has towards the idea of being gay herself.
3065600	3070560	This is an especially powerful episode because it takes a woman who is the hero of the show and a
3070560	3075200	champion for the downtrodden and revealing that she too has some bigotry in her. Though those
3075200	3080480	feelings of awkwardness may not be out of hatred or malice, the phobia is very real. It's the fear
3080480	3085680	of being ostracized by the community and how much easier it is to be an ally than someone with skin
3085680	3090160	in the game. Because of the lesbian kiss, ABC fought to keep the show from airing.
3090160	3094000	Arnold and Barr threatened to take the whole series to another network if they didn't air
3094000	3099360	the episode, and ABC eventually caved, although the episode still ran with a parental warning.
3099360	3104480	Later on, ABC would say that of the 100 calls they got, 75 were positive.
3105040	3111200	Another major event of this season is the return of Becky, not Alicia Gorenson. Sarah Chalk,
3111200	3117040	maybe best known for her work on Scrubs, was cast as The New Becky. Although Gorenson would return
3117040	3121440	to the role in the later season, the two would still swap depending on how the role could be
3121440	3126000	scheduled. Another note about season 6, it was during the airing of this season that Roseanne
3126000	3130560	Barr and Tom Arnold divorced. Their volatile relationship wasn't a secret in the press,
3130560	3140960	and it was turned into a TV movie by NBC. According to a writer for the series at the time,
3140960	3147200	Amy Sherman Paladino, this is when things start getting erratic. Season 7 is also the one where
3147200	3151280	the show finally dropped out of the top 10 most viewed shows in the United States.
3157120	3162000	It's here where the show drifts heavily into the interpersonal drama. Although it's not as if the
3162000	3166800	show hasn't always had that be a part of it, but the working class struggles of the Connor family
3166800	3172000	are starting to feel more distant here. Dan has a steady job with the city, and Roseanne is the part
3172000	3178160	owner of a restaurant. They aren't on the edge they had walked on before. Part of the show's premise
3178160	3184080	receded, and it had to rely on the strength of its cast of characters, which can still lead to
3184080	3192240	fantastic television. In White Men Can't Kiss, we get what might very well be my favorite episode
3192240	3197680	of the series. The main plotline of the episode kicks off when we find out DJ refuses to take part
3197680	3203840	in a play where he would have to kiss a girl. Roseanne, sticking up for her son, confronts his
3203840	3207440	teacher, and then learns that there's more to this story than a bashful boy.
3222480	3226160	I'm not going to change the entire play because of certain people's values.
3227280	3234480	Wow, um, I guess if he's forced to kiss somebody, then I don't want him to be in the stupid play.
3234480	3238160	Where should I put my costume as a sin? Why don't you just put it on the table, Gina?
3241600	3247440	Uh, that wouldn't be the Gina, would it? Well, you can't tell them apart.
3247760	3253120	Oh, you thought that that's why DJ didn't want it, and then you thought I knew and that I supported
3253120	3257600	that. I see a lot of this around here. It always starts with the parents.
3260240	3265440	This leads to a confrontation at home where Roseanne insists DJ do the play.
3266400	3270720	What seems to be the truth about the origins of DJ's racism come out.
3270720	3275920	I think you're being a little too hard on the kid. He grew up in Lanford, it's only 5% black,
3276880	3282000	and kissing's a new thing for DJ. It's only natural he's not as comfortable kissing a black girl as
3282000	3291040	one of his own. I did not say that. This leads to an emergency game of poker where Dan invites his
3291040	3299120	one black friend, Chuck, played by James Pickens Jr., for some guidance. It doesn't go the way you
3299120	3304400	might expect. I mean, you know, we don't know, he's prejudiced. I mean, the kid is young,
3304480	3308960	he hasn't had much exposure to other cultures. Other cultures?
3311200	3313760	Why? Is a black girl from China?
3316080	3321440	You're saying that it's okay that DJ doesn't want to kiss this girl because she's black? No,
3321440	3328000	I'm not saying that, but that's what you want me to say. No! Unless you really feel it.
3329680	3333680	Man, why do you care how I feel so much more than everyone else?
3334400	3335200	Because I'm black?
3338320	3345440	Well, yeah. So if I feel okay, all black people feel okay, because we all the same.
3345440	3346960	I would never say that.
3346960	3350880	Of course not. Some of your best friends are black.
3350880	3353600	Yes, you're one of my best friends. That's why you're here.
3353600	3357760	Okay, then why is Bob here? DJ's got to kiss a dumb girl too? No offense, Bob.
3358160	3365120	This scene reveals some important information. Most strikingly, that Chuck has been living a
3365120	3371040	life that the others had no clue about, and Dan's sudden interest in the black experience as a way
3371040	3376960	of assaging his own anxiety come off as insulting. What makes this such a great scene is Chuck's
3376960	3382880	refusal to be Dan's guiding star on this. Being his black friend doesn't, and shouldn't, mean
3382880	3388160	that he has to give Dan permission to be a bigot, or be his guiding light on all things race.
3388800	3394960	The shame Chuck, as a character, doesn't get more screen time. I am very curious to hear
3394960	3400000	more of his experiences and what it's like to be one of the only black people in Lanford.
3400000	3405520	This scene is followed by Dan admitting to his faults and telling DJ he'll have to kiss that girl.
3406080	3409840	I can't let you get out of this, because that would be wrong.
3409840	3413840	But I'm afraid of what the other kids will say.
3413840	3419760	Oh, the other kids? Well, they're going to be extremely jealous, because you're Connor.
3421760	3424800	And Connor men are known as some of the world's best kissers.
3429680	3430800	You're okay, I'll do it.
3432960	3436320	You know, DJ, you're going to kiss a lot of girls in your life, and they're all going to be different.
3437200	3439520	Well, do you think I should even kiss Lila Matthews?
3440640	3443600	What's different about her? Well, Ralph says she uses her tongue.
3448480	3449280	I'd go for it.
3450800	3456080	And lest you think the show is over, we get another fantastic scene that builds on the idea
3456080	3461120	that it isn't just Dan's latent racism that's the problem. It's a longer scene,
3461120	3463840	but it's important to see a large portion of it.
3463840	3468480	Hello. Hi.
3469840	3471280	Hi, would you let me in, please?
3474320	3476320	Uh, uh, we're closed.
3477520	3479520	Yeah, well, it says here you're open till 10.
3480320	3483360	Yeah, but see, we had a really busy day and we ran out of food.
3489840	3490800	You're scary.
3490880	3491680	Sounded like it.
3492400	3493920	I did the right thing, didn't I?
3493920	3494960	You said it was scary.
3495760	3496000	Yeah.
3499440	3504320	Hey, I think I should tell you something. I'm Mr. Williams, Gina's father.
3506480	3508400	Oh, well, come on in.
3509760	3513680	Roseanne Connor, why didn't you just say that you were Gina's father?
3515280	3518640	You need to know all your customers' names before they come into your restaurant?
3519120	3524240	Hey, Mr. Williams, uh, you think that you know what happened, but that wasn't what happened.
3524240	3529760	No, she didn't do that because you are African American. She did that because you're a man.
3529760	3532400	Yeah, and I'm prejudiced against all men equally.
3535040	3536080	That's real funny.
3536800	3542400	Hey, we're women, you know, and it's night. This is like a matter of safety.
3542400	3545600	And in situations like that, I just got to go with my gut instinct.
3545680	3548080	Well, I guess your kid inherited your instincts.
3549040	3552480	What? There's no way that that is anything like this.
3552480	3553440	Fine.
3554080	3557280	Mr. Williams, come on. I'm sure you didn't come here to fight.
3557280	3559040	Well, just forget about it anyway.
3559040	3562240	There's probably just no way you're ever going to see where I'm coming from.
3562880	3566000	You know, that's funny. I was going to say the same thing to you.
3571440	3573840	Well, I think you're right.
3574320	3577440	Well, I think he blew that out of proportion.
3581040	3584400	I mean, you invited him in. You tried to make it up to him.
3587280	3591440	You know, if he was a white guy with the exact same build in those exact same clothes,
3591440	3592800	you would have done the exact same thing.
3596560	3598560	Yeah, well, I'm glad one of us is sure.
3599280	3602320	Well, now don't beat yourself up over it, Roseanne.
3602320	3605280	You know, anybody else would have done just what you did.
3608800	3610320	Well, isn't that great?
3612720	3615520	The subtle things here are what capture my attention.
3615520	3620560	The way Jackie hides the register or how Roseanne flips the sign when she sees Mr. Williams.
3621120	3624880	Things you can imagine any scared person doing at night while closing their shop.
3625920	3627600	But why were they afraid?
3628160	3631760	The lines exchanged by Roseanne and Mr. Williams are the most telling.
3631760	3634640	They can never understand each other's experiences.
3634640	3638560	As the audience, we can understand Roseanne's experience.
3638560	3642080	We've had six and a half seasons of that, but Mr. Williams?
3642720	3644720	He's a cipher we can never really break.
3645600	3649200	Unless you're black, of course, then you probably get it pretty quickly.
3649760	3654720	Mr. Williams is the black experience in America coming right up to the face of white America
3654720	3658400	and saying that they don't see the racism he experiences.
3658400	3662320	And the realization of Roseanne at the end is that he may be right.
3662320	3666640	And that Roseanne, with those reflexive assumptions, is part of the problem.
3667200	3673360	This episode perfectly encapsulates what Roseanne is missing as a series when it comes to portraying
3673360	3674720	the working class.
3674720	3676400	Of course, it doesn't just miss race.
3676400	3678080	There are a lot of other factors as well.
3678080	3682800	But considering when this series was made, it's hard to really excuse not having it.
3682800	3685680	And it certainly points to more we could learn about in the future.
3685680	3690240	If Roseanne is to be some sort of guiding light on understanding the working class,
3690240	3692800	we have to understand areas that fall into the shadows.
3693520	3697200	To me, this is the last truly great episode of Roseanne.
3697200	3700400	It's something that could air today and still carry the same weight.
3700400	3704480	I know I basically spoiled the whole thing, but I highly recommend seeking it out and
3704480	3706000	watching it in its entirety.
3706800	3712800	And as a slight spoiler for season 10, Gina, that little girl DJ doesn't want to kiss,
3712800	3715600	they end up getting married and having a cute daughter named Mary.
3716240	3720880	One of the signs of the show starting to drift off the rails is how aware it becomes about its
3720880	3724000	success and eventual place in TV history.
3724000	3729120	The show toyed with fanciful episodes on rare occasions such as the Dream episode from season
3729120	3732400	2, but it's here where things start to kick it up a few years.
3733040	3737280	In All About Rosie, we get one of those old sitcom staples, the clip show.
3737280	3741040	These have thankfully died away, but in the past they were used to squeeze out an extra
3741040	3745200	episode of a show while keeping the budget down by having the characters sit around and
3745200	3746240	share memories.
3746240	3752320	What makes this one hour, yes, one hour, special different is the second half features Roseanne
3752320	3759760	Connor meeting famed TV moms Barbara Billingsley, June Lockhart, Isabel Sanford, Allie Mills,
3759760	3761360	and Patricia Crowley.
3761360	3765280	Whereas these mothers are initially judgmental of her brash persona,
3765280	3769200	she slowly convinces them that she's part of a new way mothers can be viewed on TV.
3771040	3786400	Season 7's finale, Sherwood Schwartz, a loving tribute, continues with the retro TV
3786400	3791840	love as the topic of Dan's boat comes up, which leads to a lengthy Gilligan's Island parody where
3791840	3796560	the actors from Roseanne take up the roles of various castaways from the classic sitcom.
3797200	3799680	You can see a similar episode in the next season.
3801040	3814480	These episodes are… not great.
3815520	3819360	There's a subtext here that underscores the larger point of revering the past.
3819360	3823440	When these shows are parodied, it's taking time to discuss the inherent silliness and
3823440	3825440	negative stereotypes they hold.
3825440	3829040	They're being deconstructed in a way to show you the limits of TV sitcoms,
3829600	3832960	and that while they may be entertaining and even have something to say,
3832960	3836640	they are also products of their time, and it's only natural the same thing what happens to the
3836640	3837600	Roseanne show.
3837600	3842240	Except Roseanne was already a show that was changing the way sitcoms could be viewed,
3842240	3846960	and it was doing it in a way that was much more interesting and clever than simply parodying
3846960	3848400	older sitcoms.
3848400	3852640	Instead of being subtextual, these parodies make the commentary overt.
3852640	3857760	Instead of trying to say something new, the show is instead saying the same thing as it always had
3857760	3858960	just a bit louder.
3859680	3862080	And things are going to get louder still.
3868160	3871840	This season marks the return of Lacey Goren's into the role of Becky.
3871840	3876240	She would swap paces with Sarah Chalk throughout the season, and then Chalk would once again take
3876240	3878080	over the role completely in season 9.
3878880	3880960	Yeah, it gets confusing.
3880960	3886160	Another sign of the declining quality of the show is when we get the episode where the Connors are
3886160	3887840	totally woke.
3887840	3892800	In The Last Thursday in November, DJ School Play gets some negative reviews when it dares
3892800	3896960	to mention that the Pilgrims and Native Americans weren't the best of buddies.
3896960	3900320	God, Roseanne, could you believe how horrible that play was?
3900320	3902640	Well, I'm just sorry I let my son be in it.
3902640	3904640	It was nothing but violent propaganda.
3904640	3910000	And this debate drifts into another cheesy production where the cast pretends to be Pilgrims.
3910000	3911840	So what's wrong with this episode?
3911920	3916160	In the context of the series, where we had earlier episodes such as White Men Can't Kiss
3916160	3920480	and Don't Ask, Don't Tell, where the Connors learn about their own faults and blind spots,
3920480	3923680	they're just kind of woke for this episode.
3923680	3927760	The heat comes from the nameless parents at the school play who are passing morons and
3927760	3931280	capable of speaking in anything other than shitty right-wing talking points.
3932000	3934320	There's no real nuance or discussion.
3934320	3938480	This episode more than most others embodies all the things that are wrong with the Roseanne
3938480	3939600	show in later seasons.
3940480	3943040	Even though its message is ultimately a good one,
3943040	3946640	of respecting the people's displaced and massacred by colonialism,
3947520	3950640	but Season 8 had some bright spots that I would be remiss to point out.
3950640	3954960	The white sheep of the family includes a much-needed return of working-class dynamics when
3954960	3958720	it's revealed that Darlene has offered a relatively high-paying copywriting job
3958720	3962240	that she turned down so she could finish school and find something better.
3962240	3964720	The job was not for $200, okay?
3964720	3968400	It was as an advertising copywriter and it started at $500 a week.
3970160	3974080	The Conners are suddenly confronted with someone not being in the same working-class boots
3974080	3975520	and it creates tension at home.
3999600	4009840	The pain and pride of seeing Darlene succeed becomes clear.
4029600	4034800	This episode introduces something new.
4034800	4037680	The idea of one of the Conners making it.
4037680	4040720	The thing the Conners have supposedly been working so hard for.
4040720	4043680	The success of their children is finally happening.
4043680	4047280	This might be one of the last episodes of the series to deal with being working-class
4047280	4051840	and in a way that doesn't sugarcoat the Conners as unflinchingly supportive.
4051840	4056080	It portrays the fear of losing a child to a world that they could never be a part of,
4056080	4058960	knowing that it's in Darlene's best interests,
4058960	4063280	but with the fear that she may become one of the people they've always resented.
4063280	4068560	This all unravels in later episodes and we learn Darlene is pregnant in another mouth to shut up
4068560	4070320	and she and David get engaged.
4086080	4098480	The season putters along with Darlene getting married and Dan having a heart attack.
4099040	4101440	While these are major moments for the Conners,
4101440	4104080	I'm going to skip right ahead to the final episode of the season.
4104720	4106080	Fights and stuff.
4106080	4109840	When Dan won't stick to a diet regime that will help him with his heart condition,
4109840	4112320	he and Roseanne end up having a huge fight.
4112320	4114640	It starts with a cute callback to the first season.
4116480	4117360	I'll fix dinner.
4118080	4119200	I'm fixing dinner.
4119760	4123120	Oh, but honey, you just fixed dinner 11 years ago.
4124640	4125600	You want me to fix dinner?
4126160	4127280	I'll fix dinner.
4127280	4128320	I'm fixing dinner.
4129440	4132800	Oh, but honey, you just fixed dinner three years ago.
4135760	4137040	Then it gets nasty.
4137040	4139680	There are failures, Roseanne, and the only reason you won't admit it
4139680	4141920	is because you'll have to admit you failed as a mother.
4142720	4147040	The only way I failed as a mother is to let Becky and Darlene get married
4147040	4150880	so young that they threw their whole life away on a man, just like I did.
4150880	4155360	All the insecurities of being a parent boil over as the things that kept the family together,
4155360	4160400	the children, may not be enough when their goal of giving them a better life seems out of reach.
4160400	4165120	The real pain and discord here isn't from Roseanne and Dan not being able to get along,
4165120	4168080	but the fear of not being able to give their kids a better life,
4168080	4170400	the fear of remaining working class.
4170400	4175280	It's an anxiety that many can relate to and one that contradicts the myth of the American dream,
4175280	4178880	that anyone can be successful as long as they're willing to work hard enough.
4178880	4180640	Conners are hardworking.
4180640	4183040	The system just wasn't built for them.
4191440	4195920	The explosive finale of the last season may have just been an excuse to let John Goodman
4195920	4197680	spend some time away from the show.
4197680	4202480	Frustrations backstage and a burgeoning movie career are all cited as reasons for his departure,
4202480	4205280	though he would still show up for several episodes this season.
4205280	4209920	With Dan Connor gone though, and many of the cast regulars appearing only sporadically,
4209920	4213680	season 9 focused on Roseanne in some bizarre situations.
4213680	4218560	Janet Leahy, a writer for the series, credits Roseanne's executive control for some of the
4218560	4220880	more ludicrous stories that appear this season.
4220880	4221920	She says,
4221920	4226640	It is one thing to have editorial power and another to have creative power.
4226640	4230800	And I think that crossed over in the end, and that was part of the problem.
4230800	4235280	Season 9 is best known as the season where the Conners win the lottery.
4235280	4241040	After Dan and Roseanne are hastily brought back together through a series of cheesy TV parodies,
4241040	4245360	the Conners win the jackpot of $108 million dollars.
4245360	4249360	Adjusted for inflation, that works out to a shit ton of money in 2018.
4250080	4255040	In Millions from Heaven, we get this moment that somehow always makes me laugh.
4255040	4256720	I help pick the numbers.
4256720	4259520	I don't know why, but it always works.
4259520	4263840	The lottery win leads Roseanne on a number of strange adventures that my notes have marked
4263840	4266800	descriptively as weird shit.
4266800	4270720	This is also where John Goodman is noticeably absent for several episodes,
4270720	4274160	explained as him going to California to care for his ill mother.
4274240	4279680	In his place, we get some truly weird shit, including parodies of Rosemary's Baby,
4279680	4283920	Roseanne Connor literally fighting a train filled with terrorists,
4284480	4289120	and an appearance by a fake Hillary Clinton and a real Steven Seagal.
4289120	4295280	By the way, Roseambo, yeah it was called that, is widely thought of as the worst episode of the
4295280	4300800	series and is certainly the lowest rated one, at least from the original 9 season run.
4300800	4305280	As the series winds down, a pregnant darling goes into premature labor in
4305280	4308960	The Miracle, an episode with a story credited to Roseanne Barr.
4308960	4312320	The baby, Harris Connor Healy, is close to death,
4312320	4315200	and the Connor family money isn't able to solve their problem.
4315200	4319040	It's not a question of money, Mrs. Connor. Unfortunately, we cannot
4319040	4320800	duplicate the conditions in the womb.
4321520	4324960	But this is crazy. I mean, there's got to be something that you can do.
4324960	4326960	Well, I wish there was, Mrs. Connor. I'm so sorry.
4328400	4332800	What's perhaps most notable about this episode is the sudden turn towards the spiritual.
4332800	4335040	You're making it up. That doesn't work.
4335040	4338800	Oh yes, it does, Jackie. And you know why? Because they believe it's gonna work.
4340400	4342800	I read that in all those books that Nancy gave me. And you know what?
4342880	4344560	They all say the very same thing. You know what they say?
4345600	4349200	That the spiritual is the cause for the physical.
4349200	4354480	This is a strange episode for me to watch. As someone with no faith or belief in the supernatural,
4354480	4357520	Roseanne Connor is coming from a fundamentally different place.
4357520	4361760	The struggle to balance the question in her mind eventually leads her to a conclusion that's the
4361760	4366480	exact opposite of mine. This is one of those episodes where I feel very keenly that I'm
4366480	4371360	looking at someone completely different from me. Although season 9 had a lot of low points,
4371360	4375680	I don't think I would call this one of them. The struggle between faith and science show how,
4375680	4379840	even with material things, people still turn to the spiritual in the face of
4379840	4384880	unsolvable tragedy. Although I don't like the idea of divine intervention being the solution,
4384880	4388960	it does speak to the powerlessness people feel that lead them to believe it.
4389680	4393600	As you might have suspected from the title of the episode, The Baby Pulls Through.
4393600	4398240	And that brings us to the finale, a two-parter titled, Into That Good Night,
4398240	4402960	with another story credit to Roseanne Parr. The story of the last episode largely centers
4402960	4406560	around where the family is heading and the happy futures they all have together.
4406560	4411200	Darlene and David with their new daughter, Becky and Mark expecting a child of their own,
4411200	4416800	and DJ finding a calling as a filmmaker. We even get an almost woke moment about gender identity.
4417680	4430400	As the episode comes to a close, and it seems like we're getting a nice
4430400	4434560	bow to put on The Adventures of the Connor Clan, a recreation of the show's opening
4434560	4439920	credit sequence changes everything. A lengthy voiceover from Roseanne gives us the true story
4439920	4444160	of all the characters in the series, how Becky and David were the ones who got together,
4444160	4449920	and Darlene married Mark, how Jackie was actually a lesbian, and perhaps most shocking.
4449920	4473360	The last season, and much of the series,
4473360	4477520	are revealed to have been Roseanne working in the writing room her family had gotten her
4477520	4478800	at the end of season two.
4508240	4532400	The show ends with a quote from T.E. Lawrence, taken from the introduction to his signature
4532400	4534000	work, The Seven Pillars of Wisdom.
4562400	4574960	In 2011, the two-part finale was ranked number nine on the TV Guide Network special,
4574960	4581120	TV's Most Unforgettable Finale. Here are some comments from Barr herself, as well as Sarah
4581120	4581600	Gilbert.
4593120	4597200	That's how it ends. It doesn't end with a happy reunion on ABC every Christmas.
4597840	4599760	You know, it's not gonna go like that.
4600640	4606160	We probably should have been done at season eight. The lottery and stuff? It got so surreal and
4606160	4612320	started to follow Roseanne's real path. It wasn't what it started as. For me, I like the struggle of
4612320	4617600	the family a little more. The financial struggle. The show ended on a somber note, but lived on in
4617600	4622960	syndication. Reruns still air to this day on some channels. The struggle of a working-class
4622960	4627040	family could have been consigned to the history books, and this video need not even exist,
4627040	4630800	but the TV cards weren't done with the Roseanne show just yet.
