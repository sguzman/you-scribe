0	7620	The world is weird, it makes me mad, but at least I get to talk about it, with Jose.
7620	12900	In the first episode of the 1999 animated series Futurama, a delivery boy named Fry
12900	16340	gets transported 1,000 years into the future.
16340	20660	When he's outfitted for a chip that will forever brand him as a delivery boy, it's
20660	25740	done so under the auspices of the motto, you gotta do what you gotta do.
25740	29500	This image perfectly captures the idea of being swallowed up by a system that will make
29500	34060	every decision for you, and you can only resign yourself to the idea that this is how
34060	36340	the world works.
36340	41340	Terms like these carry this deep resignation that the world is the way it is, and change
41340	44220	just isn't gonna happen.
44220	47740	Some of the most popular political content on YouTube can fall under the category of
47740	53660	owning the libs, anti-SJW commentary, taking down the right, or some other adversarial
53660	54660	position.
54660	58740	It tries to create the idea of a political position not so much around what a person
58740	63140	believes, but what that person perceives themselves as standing up against.
63140	66860	Over the past few weeks, some of the major controversies in the social media space have
66860	72180	been manufactured nonsense, from the potato head rebranding to some old Dr. Seuss book
72180	76260	no longer being published, but you can see similar narratives cropping around real stories,
76260	78580	such as the recent shooting in Atlanta.
78580	82420	Discussions about issues regarding the LGBT community, race, and gender are immediately
82420	83520	waved aside.
83520	87020	The problem isn't just that figures on the right lie about this stuff, the bigger issue
87020	90180	is that they're telling their audience that it's not something worth caring about to
90180	95340	begin with, and those who do claim to care about it are either hypocrites or cultists.
95340	98580	The innuendo studio's YouTube channel has a couple of videos on this topic from its
98580	102740	alt-right playbook series, particularly how rhetoric is used to control conversations
102740	104740	using a barrage of accusations.
104740	108140	It's why so many of the stories I mentioned above are always framed as attacks.
108140	112220	It's never an issue explored, it's always phrased as the left, or hysterical and out
112220	116380	of control when no one would even know about these issues if it wasn't for some right-wing
116380	118340	loudmouth bringing them up first.
118340	122700	What I want to focus on is not just how the right engages with this debate, but how there's
122700	128400	this implicit effort to get people to disengage entirely from the world of politics.
128400	131820	One of the most effective ways of controlling public conversation is convincing people not
131820	134620	to engage in it, at least not honestly.
134620	138380	Back when I made my big video on Dave Rubin many years ago, one of the weirdest things
138380	142300	about his content was how often he said he didn't want to be talking about politics.
142300	146100	It's a line I saw repeated by the likes of Tim Poole, The Quartering, or anyone who
146100	148460	serves a young right-wing audience.
148460	151780	This idea that they really wish they didn't have to talk about any of this stuff, but
151780	155680	if it wasn't just for those darn people on the left, we could ignore it and go back
155680	157820	to talking about fun things.
157820	162780	Carried with that is this idea that caring about this stuff is not really worthy of attention,
162780	167020	if not for the rabble-rousers, who are supposedly not coming from an honest place.
167020	169780	And the reason they tell their audience to care about now is because it's a threat
169780	171260	to the status quo.
171260	175900	State into this mindset is the idea that the world is essentially buying the way it
175900	176900	is.
176900	181460	Injustices are rare, local, and handled by the systems we have in place.
181460	185940	Maybe we need some tweaks, sometimes there's a bad apple, but things are actually pretty
185940	190620	good right now and we don't have to worry about any sort of systemic changes.
190620	194580	If someone feels satisfied in their life, they're a lot less likely to become politically
194580	195580	active.
195580	199180	And if they're told the world is fine, aside from the rabble-rousers, that's another incentive
199180	203220	to just tune out and not really engage with politics.
203220	207100	And I know that sounds counterproductive if you're trying to win an election, but it
207100	211820	also pairs with the fact that some people know there are problems in their lives and
211820	216060	the world isn't perfectly fine when there are people who are struggling.
216060	219780	Most of those problems will be filed under the idea that this is just the way the world
219780	223300	works, best to just accept it, be a grownup, and move on.
223300	227100	But if the person is still annoyed because, well, there's a lot about the world that
227100	229620	sucks, a villain needs to be created.
229620	233540	So if anything bad happens, it's probably the left's fault.
233540	237940	Their audience is motivated into action only against the perceived threat to their status
237940	238940	quo.
238940	241340	Things were always fine before they changed.
241340	245500	That's the essence of right-wing messaging, because, of course, it's maintaining the
245500	249340	status quo or possibly some reactionary stuff to move things backwards.
249340	251340	It's never the system that's the problem.
251340	254020	It's the bad actor or actors who have ruined it.
254020	257820	It's how an unjust police killing is framed as one bad apple rather than symbolic of
257820	259220	a systemic problem.
259220	263140	Or if a scientific body is saying you need to change how you think about something, it's
263140	265900	probably been infiltrated by some provocateurs.
265900	267420	The system is fine.
267420	271800	It's just some rotten agents who have somehow corrupted it from within.
271800	275340	And if we just get rid of a couple of bad people, we can go back to not talking about
275340	280220	these things and not really caring, because things are fine in the status quo.
280220	284020	That's why the aforementioned controversies are framed as an attack by the left.
284020	287020	They're signaling to their audience that caring about this stuff is silly, and only
287020	288980	silly people on the left do it.
288980	293700	But if we let this slide, we could very well end up in some kind of 1984-esque hellscape.
293700	299780	Notice that, in all of that rhetoric, no political actions are really espoused aside from some
299780	302860	vague references to principles like free speech.
302860	308100	There are no policy ideas or broader initiatives, just a vague hatred for the other side, because
308340	312660	why would you need to motivate someone into political action when your politics are based
312660	314500	on keeping things the same?
314500	318020	Here's what apathetic political engagement would look like.
318020	323260	One morning, there will be a story all over social media about how the left, those scoundrels,
323260	326660	have decided that Paddington Bear is now a female bear.
326660	331580	The right-wing Pundo Sphere, all in unison, will start talking about how the left is out
331580	337380	of control, and if this is to stand, soon the nation and the West will all fall.
337380	340380	When the audience laps it up, they might even up with their donations.
340380	344700	The mainstream press reports on it, with some confusion as to why anyone would care about
344700	348220	this, but still, you know, reporting on it because they're hungry for the ratings.
348220	352220	And this eventually filters up to opportunistic politicians, who will give speeches designed
352220	357620	specifically for Twitter, where they decry that poor Paddington Bear will now be a she
357620	359460	instead of a he.
359460	363020	The big winners in all of this are the right-wing media people who get clicks, the mainstream
363020	366340	media who get ratings, and politicians who might get a few votes.
366340	370700	A few votes, by the way, based on sharing a common interest, not because they're proposing
370700	375820	some kind of Paddington-centric legislation, or even if they draw up that bill because
375820	380340	the story lasts a little longer than New Cycle than most, it'll probably be shot down and
380340	384300	quickly forgotten because, really, this is all performance theater.
384300	387280	What exactly are the politics of all of this?
387280	392220	As best I can tell from this scenario I just made up, it would be that the left is terrible
392220	396660	and trying to change things, when things should never be changed, with subtle digs
396660	399960	at women and the LGBT community for good measure.
399960	406240	This isn't really a coherent political ideology, it's just a brief exercise of rage designed
406240	410780	to whip everyone into a frenzy before they settle back down and go back to the world
410780	413260	ready to let it resume unchanged.
413260	416600	It's basically the two-minute hate from 1984.
416600	421140	And I now demand bonus points for making a 1984 reference that isn't completely played
421140	423900	out and actually makes sense.
423900	428920	Politics should be about something, you know, a goal, some kind of achievable end.
428920	434120	This anger that's stoked is designed to get people riled up without them actually channeling
434120	436120	that anger to something constructive.
436120	440200	Aside from, you know, providing monetary support to the right-wing media system and voting
440200	443160	for politicians who will do absolutely nothing for them.
443160	446560	In one of the rare instances where one of these stories can break through, it's in
446560	450680	service to a power structure trying to maintain the status quo, such as a government pressure
450700	455260	in a university to remove certain courses from its curriculum or removing training that
455260	458220	raises issues of systemic inequalities.
458220	462480	Political victory here looks like silencing the other side of the debate in an effort
462480	464720	to maintain the status quo.
464720	469420	This is also why conservative commentators often frame their critiques of these issues
469420	470420	so dishonestly.
470420	474560	They present these issues to their audience as nonsensical as a way of signaling to them
474560	477980	that these issues can be safely ignored and discarded.
477980	482420	Giving these ideas honestly would force this side to genuinely engage with them, but by
482420	486980	not doing that, they can infectively make their audience misinformed, disengaged, and
486980	489960	apathetic towards any sort of social change.
489960	492800	Another way this takes shape that's very similar to apathy is cynicism.
492800	497120	While it exists across the political spectrum, I think it's much stronger on the right.
497120	501360	The ethos of, that's just the way the world is, without ever exploring the thought on
501360	503360	the way the world can be.
503360	507320	And while there is reason to use cynicism, the world is a rough place, and progress doesn't
507320	510920	always work out, there's a difference between acknowledging that reality and becoming a
510920	512420	cynic yourself.
512420	515840	When you can transform people into cynics, that's really advantageous to anyone trying
515840	517900	to maintain the status quo.
517900	521300	So it shouldn't be a surprise that it's the tool most often deployed by people who have
521300	523540	the most to lose if the system were changed.
523540	528140	It's not a coincidence that so much billionaire money funds these fringe right-wing outlets.
528140	532580	From PragerU to The Daily Wire, these media companies can trace their origins to investments
532580	536460	from fracking and oil industries that are looking for a slick outlet that will fight
536460	541480	to ensure regulations are imposed upon industries that make climate change worse and undermine
541480	543580	investment in renewable energy.
543580	547140	This can mean everything from spreading lies about climate change to relentlessly attacking
547140	550880	politicians seeking to implement policies that would reduce carbon emissions.
550880	554480	In other words, they fight to maintain the status quo.
554480	558440	As a side note, I would like to say that this doesn't mean that Dennis Prager or Ben Shapiro
558440	560680	are necessarily frauds doing it for the money.
560680	562040	I suppose it could be true.
562040	566000	The main point is, the reason these guys are funded is because they say the things the
566000	570320	energy billionaires want them to say, whether or not it's genuine or not, misses the whole
570320	573000	point of why they exist in the first place.
573000	577660	The point of channels like these are to confuse political activism as engaging with the channels
577660	578660	themselves.
578660	582580	That is to say, you are achieving some kind of political goal by consuming the content
582580	583580	they produce.
583580	587900	In effect, you are helping to dunk on the libs by watching one of these videos.
587900	590160	You aren't advocating for policy change, of course.
590160	592180	You aren't encouraging political activism.
592180	594060	You're just pointing and laughing at someone.
594060	597220	And the world can use on without any major changes.
597220	599140	Which is the whole point.
599140	603020	That's the sinister nature of these channels, all the while collecting subscriber fees and
603020	606860	advertising dollars along the way, and directing you to vote for the occasional politician
606860	610020	who will help their donors make a few extra billion dollars.
610020	613120	And who wouldn't feel cynical seeing a business model like that laid out?
613120	617020	The truth is a depressing thing sometimes, but I hope that no one watching this would
617020	622280	ever consider giving in to a power imbalance like that on the basis of the idea that this
622280	624720	is how the world works.
624720	627520	Apathy and cynicism are poison to the left.
627520	630520	It discourages activism and encourages disengagement.
630520	635000	It's never expressly endorsed, but as I hope I've demonstrated, is implicit in a lot of
635000	636000	conservative media.
636000	639800	While you might be able to debate someone on facts or reach them through emotion, it's
639800	644720	a lot harder when the very idea of caring about something is made distasteful.
644720	649480	Or the only things people seem to care about are standing in opposition to some perceived
649480	650480	enemy.
650480	654960	Particularly, I hate how the left's compassion and kindness are presented as disingenuous
654960	659080	or manipulative, as if no one could truly believe these things.
659080	663240	It's certainly possible to believe these things if you're willing to actually have some empathy
663240	668320	and concern for the people around you, and sometimes even the people you've never met.
668320	674080	One of the nice things about caring is if you believe in it, and you do it, it's true.
674080	678280	Certainly I've been just as guilty of this as anyone, and I'm not convinced it's necessarily
678280	682680	a bad thing entirely, pointing out how full of crap people are is important, but pointing
682680	686240	out how wrong someone is isn't the same thing as having a political ideology.
686240	689720	It's also something that hurts us more than it hurts the right.
689720	694000	We need to organize and create action to change the world for the better, and they don't.
694000	695560	What do we do, Jose?
695560	697160	Tell us the answers.
697160	702620	If you would like to know a starting point, I would suggest you look as local as possible.
702620	705920	This is where you'll have the strongest impact as an individual.
705920	709960	Think about the issues that matter most to you, and join local organizations that engage
709960	716160	with them, whether it's something like environmentalism, or labor reforms, or social justice issues
716160	717480	more broadly.
717480	722200	Look at public forums like city council meetings, or residence association meetings, anywhere
722200	725480	where people are offered an open forum to discuss the issues that matter to them, and
725480	727880	meet other people who care about the same things.
727880	731240	Even something as simple as attending a protest can make a difference.
731240	735560	Try to think of it as joining a group, a community that can help change the world around
735560	736560	you.
736560	739360	Because when you find more of those people who are like you and want to change things,
739360	742320	you'll realize you actually have a lot of power when you work together.
742320	746360	However you decide to use your political consciousness, I just want you to try to be constructively
746360	750880	engaged, and as terrible as the world is sometimes, you can't afford the luxury of not caring
750880	753640	enough to want to make the world a better place.
753640	757560	Humanity has been slowly improving itself over generations, but it never got better
757560	760960	by not caring.
760960	764280	This is a short video, I know people like the shorter ones, but I try not to make them
764280	767040	unless they have something I actually want to say, and this is something that's been
767040	768800	on the back of my mind for a while.
768800	773020	You can join the lovely people whose names are floating up the screen, those are my patrons
773020	777600	and members, they don't just get their names in the credits, although that's pretty awesome
777600	778600	right?
778600	782520	They also get early access to videos and download things to my theme songs.
782520	784400	It's all super cool.
784400	789440	If you'd like to support the channel in a non-monetary fashion, you can like, comment,
789440	792200	subscribe, and hit the bell for notifications.
792200	796280	If you don't know what to comment, why not tell me your favorite song that's a cover
796280	797480	of another song?
797480	799280	Thank you everyone for watching!
