1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Friends, I'm going to need a boost to get through this video.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,760
Can I get a Woah Jose?

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:19,520
Married with Children was one of the most controversial hits in television history.

4
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:24,400
It was beloved by its audience, reviled by critics, and more than once the target of censorship.

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,800
It was a brash, loud, obnoxious show about a working-class family that would ring each

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,480
other's neck for a spoonful of chili. The spicy sitcom was the antithesis of family TV comedy in

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,880
the 1980s and 90s. To understand how a show like this even got on the air in the first place,

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,200
we have to set the clock back to before the idea was a glimmer in the eyes of its creators and

9
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,160
start with the founding of the Fox Television Network. In the 1980s, there were only three

10
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,920
major TV networks in the United States, NBC, ABC, and CBS, and this had more or less been the case

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,960
for decades. Rupert Murdoch, through his media conglomerate News Corporation, wanted to enter

12
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,680
into the network TV market under the banner of 20th Century Fox, the famed movie studio

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,840
which Murdoch had recently acquired. Murdoch spent $2.5 billion purchasing TV stations in

14
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:15,920
major markets throughout the US and nearly $600 million purchasing TCF, 20th Century Fox's TV

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:22,320
production studio. He would create a new network, the Fox Broadcasting Company, or FBC. This was

16
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,920
quickly rebranded to the much catchier name of Fox. The new network, the fourth of its kind on

17
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,600
American televisions, launched on October 9, 1986, with its only original programming being a late

18
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,640
night chat show starring Joan Rivers, creatively titled The Late Show. The show didn't last more

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,520
than a few months, but Fox upped the stakes in 1987, launching two nights of original programming

20
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,560
on Saturdays and Sundays. The Saturday lineup was pretty forgettable with shows such as The New

21
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,360
Adventures of Beans Baxter and Women in Prison, which I assume isn't a porno. On the other hand,

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,800
Sunday Nights introduced the world to both Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street and The Simpsons on the

23
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:07,440
Tracy Elman show. It also introduced us to The Bundys, stars of the sitcom Married with Children.

24
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,240
A young executive at Fox, Garth and Cierra, tapped Michael Moy and Ron Levitt, the duo responsible

25
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:18,560
for the sitcom Silver Spoons and It's Your Move, without much money to offer the pair,

26
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,200
and Cierra instead gave them something even more alluring. Creative control in shaping a sitcom,

27
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,080
however they saw fit. The perks were, you know, we didn't get network notes, you know, and no

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,560
testing, research and development, all of the usual red tape and crap, and this is what they

29
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,040
sold us. Sick homes of that era typically featured happy, well-functioning families like the kind

30
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,000
you'd see on The Cosby Show, growing pains, or family ties. The successes of these shows led to

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,120
a host of imitators. Levitt and Moy were determined not to follow suit. They suspected that the

32
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,280
American public was ready for something different, a show that didn't wrap saccharine messages into

33
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,880
a family-friendly package. Your life sucks, and they all have clean houses and hugs at the end,

34
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,880
and Ron and Mike wanted to do a show where no matter what happened, after you turned it off,

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:12,560
you could feel a little bit better about yourself. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 1989, Levitt and Moy

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,200
described what they thought of TV that had a message. I can't believe that you need your

37
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,120
morality taught by the kids on Facts of Life, Levitt says. Yeah, Moy says, if you want to watch

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,400
a show and learn about premarital sex, let Alf teach you. The original concept of the show was

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,040
inspired by the acts of two popular comedians at the time, Sam Kinison and Roseanne Barr.

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,560
Best thing about marriage is that these are connected.

41
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,920
They don't come on. Because if they did, your wife would take it as soon as you got married.

42
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,280
You know, you're married now, you will be needing that.

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,640
You know, like clean stuff and cook stuff and help them with their little problems like I care.

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,680
I'd rather lay there on the couch criticizing others and then run all the charge cards up to

45
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,480
the limit. The idea of these two being married to one another is the spark that got this show

46
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,880
going. The comedians were even supposedly approached to star in it, only for both to turn

47
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,680
down their respective roles. Though years later, creator Michael Moy would say that if this casting

48
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,080
option was seriously considered, he was never consulted about it. Levitt and Moy preferred

49
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,080
the actors cast in the roles to be unknowns without pre-existing personas. They wanted

50
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,840
the Bundy family to be a unique creation. Together, they wrote a pilot script that

51
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,840
thumbed its nose at sitcom conventions. It was a pilot that would be a game changer.

52
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,200
Although the existence of this series is held up as an example of how times have changed,

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:43,280
as if this show could never be produced today because the politically correct have taken over

54
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,360
the airwaves and destroyed comedy, it's worth noting that when that pilot script was first seen

55
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,160
by the network, it wasn't warmly received. The hands-off approach promised to Levitt and Moy

56
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,400
would eventually vanish and suddenly the research department came in with suggestions of making the

57
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:19,600
Bundy's more loving. Levitt and Moy resisted input from the research department and they were

58
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,800
backed by Ann Cyr, but luck was on their side as well. Fox was a new network and in desperate need

59
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
of content, so they were given far more leeway than they might have gotten on another network.

60
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,440
With their debut only a few weeks away, the Fox executives didn't have time to plug up holes in

61
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,880
their schedule. It wasn't the more lax standards towards political correctness that got married

62
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,160
with children on the airwaves. The real cause is more likely the unique circumstances in which this

63
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,720
series was created around. I suspect that worked in the favor of Levitt and Moy getting their way

64
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,840
on making this the show they wanted to see. And the show they wanted starred an unconventional

65
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,600
family. The Bundy's were headed by its patriarch, Al Bundy, played by Ed O'Neill, a dramatic actor

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:05,200
with no comedy experience. O'Neill was one of the last actors cast after a very lengthy search.

67
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,320
It was his unique take on the character that really sealed the role for him, resigned to his fate of

68
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:14,640
being married to a wife who sat around all day with kids who treated him like a cash machine,

69
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:21,280
all while working at a job he hated, selling women's shoes. The perpetual loser often seen with a hand

70
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,960
stuffed down the front of his pants. Al had a rough charm to him that made him an underdog

71
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:30,000
he wanted to root for, even when he was ogling women or stealing from innocent people. He had

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,160
a strange magnetism to him. Al Bundy would define Ed O'Neill's career for a long time to come.

73
00:06:36,160 --> 00:07:05,840
Al's wife Peggy was played by Katie Seagal, and her fiery

74
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:11,040
personality was completed with her signature tall red hair. Originally written as a couch potato,

75
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,520
it was Katie Seagal who decided to play Peggy as someone who saw herself as a hot chick married

76
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,320
to a loser, and she helped define her unique fashion sense, taken from the look of a housewife

77
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:26,560
in the 1960s. It created a vision of Peggy as a mother you wouldn't see on other TV shows. Peggy

78
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,760
was the anti-housewife. She would sooner spend the day watching Oprah and eating bonbons than go

79
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:50,800
grocery shopping or talk to her children. The Bundy children, Kelly and Bud, were originally

80
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,920
played by Tina Kaspery and Hunter Carson. They even filmed the series pilot with the two of them,

81
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,280
but the producers felt they didn't quite fit into the role, and they were recast.

82
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,480
Christina Applegate and David Faustino would take their place. Although they were loud and bratty

83
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,720
from the get-go, these characters would be more meaningfully defined as the series progressed.

84
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,280
The only constant throughout the series was their bitter bickering.

85
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,720
The Bundys were joined by their neighbors, Steve and Marcy Rhodes. David Garrison was the first

86
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:33,520
person cast for the series, having worked with Leave It in Moy on It's Your Move. Steve Rhodes

87
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:38,880
was the smarmy, yuppy, newlywed next-door who walked with an unearned sense of accomplishment,

88
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:56,800
the complete opposite of Al. His wife Marcy, played by Amanda Burce, grew considerably

89
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,800
throughout the series, going from a demure woman who subtly controlled her husband,

90
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,480
to an outspoken feminist who embodied the worst of liberal hypocrisy.

91
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:36,560
And last, but certainly not least, was the Bundy's faithful dog Buck, played by a Briard

92
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,000
conveniently named Buck. This very good boy would typically be seen sitting around the

93
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,200
Bundy living room pondering the many mysteries of the universe.

94
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,000
The world was introduced to the Bundy family for the first time on April 5th,

95
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,280
1987. The pilot for this show established a few basics right from the get-go.

96
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,240
First of all, the kids do not get along.

97
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,080
We also see the role money plays in the cast-strapped Bundy household. It's what the

98
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,600
kids expect from Al instead of love, and it's how Peg controls him.

99
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:35,600
Al working in the shoe store shows us another familiar sight,

100
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,080
him struggling with a heavyset customer.

101
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:51,680
And that was the first of many, many fat woman jokes. These jokes were defense mechanisms for

102
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,320
Al, a way of striking back against customers who treat him poorly and indirectly, although

103
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:00,800
against the horrible life he finds himself trapped in. It doesn't excuse the jokes, of course,

104
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,200
but it does give us some context to understand where Al is coming from, an ignorant man broken

105
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,480
by his crappy job striking out at an easy target. We also meet a small addition to the cast,

106
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:16,160
the character Luke Ventura, played by Rich Scheidner, Al's co-worker at the shoe store.

107
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,160
He appeared in a few episodes in season one, but disappeared by the time the second season

108
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,240
rolled around. His job was to be the single guy who would make Al regret getting married.

109
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,920
Luke Ventura also gives me the chance to mention the naming convention for characters on this show.

110
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:38,080
Most people assume the Bundys were named after serial killer Ted Bundy, but they were actually

111
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,560
named after pro wrestler King Kong Bundy. The Rhodeses were named after Dusty Rhodes,

112
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,240
and Luke Ventura was named after Jesse The Body Ventura.

113
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,480
Is it okay if my family comes for a visit?

114
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,920
Well, it doesn't really matter what you say. Besides, how bad can it be?

115
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
The second act of the show is taken up by a visit from Steve and Marcy Rhodes,

116
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,240
the newlyweds who have just moved in next door to the Bundys. Steve and Marcy are,

117
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,240
well, they're not like the Bundys. I feel that sports glorify violence and competition,

118
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,280
and I don't think it's psychologically healthy. When we have a child, we don't want it to grow up

119
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:25,280
with that winning-is-the-only-thing attitude. A child is better off not being exposed to sports.

120
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,520
You're gonna neuter him, too?

121
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,360
And this really encapsulates the relationship between the Bundys and the Rhodes in these first

122
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:39,360
few seasons. The gentle sensibilities of Steve and Marcy are mocked and degraded by Alan Pegg.

123
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,480
It's like when you're sitting somewhere and they come over and they say to you,

124
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,520
what are you thinking? And you start thinking, you know, if I wanted you to know, I'd be talking.

125
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:56,480
You've got a good thing going. Don't start letting him have a good time

126
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,360
alone. But we still have a good time together. Then why is he staying up?

127
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,040
And soon the Bundys have pulled the Rhodeses into their misery.

128
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,400
I demand to know what you do late at night after I've gone to bed.

129
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,800
Are you having fun alone, Steve?

130
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:19,520
No, I'd just like to stay up and think.

131
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,240
What are you thinking?

132
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,840
Well, if I wanted you to know, I'd...

133
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,800
Al, I'll see you next week at the game.

134
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,760
Peggy, I think we'll be spending a lot of time together.

135
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,400
Come on, Steve. We've got to talk.

136
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,800
I'll make it quick. I'm going to watch boxing.

137
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,560
You'll watch nothing.

138
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,640
When the Rhodeses show up, I can't help but be reminded of Edward Albee's play Who's

139
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,440
Afraid of Virginia Woolf, the story of an older married couple that invites over newlyweds for

140
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:59,200
dinner and then subjects them to a night of mind games. In that play, George and Martha,

141
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,480
aimed for the first US president and his wife, contrast the illusions and promises of America.

142
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,720
We see echoes of that in Married with Children, though in this case, the promise of the happy

143
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:14,160
nuclear family is being undermined by the miserable reality of the Bundy clan. And while

144
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,960
the Rhodeses think their lives are on a different track, Al and Peggy are ready to pull them back

145
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:24,800
down to reality, or at least their version of reality. The style of comedy is undeniably

146
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,760
a farce with over-the-top acting and jokes that slap you in the face. The show's sense

147
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:36,800
of humor was rapid and constant. Even though some of it is problematic, particularly Al's

148
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,600
one-man war against overweight women, quite a bit of it stands up surprisingly well, especially

149
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,200
considering it was written over 30 years ago. The pilot premiered with little fanfare and even

150
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,680
smaller ratings. Fox was still an unknown and had trouble attracting an audience who weren't even

151
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,880
sure how to tune into the channel. That said, Married with Children quickly became its top sitcom

152
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,040
and even got a slightly warm reception from some critics. Over the years, that would change,

153
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:06,240
though. A major topic in the first season is Al's manhood in the modern world. Al is very much a

154
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:11,600
relic beholden to his days as a high school football star, bitter that his life peaked at 18.

155
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,840
Now his dreams are much simpler, like wanting an extra bathroom that's all his own.

156
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:54,480
Einstein had his own room. You think Einstein invented the theory of relativity in his wife's

157
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:59,760
exercise room? No, he was in his own room with the door closed. Al arguing that a man deserves

158
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:04,800
a room of his own is a direct inversion of Virginia Woolf's essay, A Room of One's Own,

159
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,840
a feminist work which argued for women to have space to enter the literary tradition. Al very

160
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:15,680
explicitly opines for the days when men had all the privileges and women had, well, all the chores

161
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:22,080
and the children. And Al argues for these good old days using feminist rhetoric. And keep in mind,

162
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:28,160
this is Al talking about being an oppressed man in 1987. Al is right about his life sucking. He's

163
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,400
a working class man trying to support a family in a world that's making it tougher all the time,

164
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:37,200
but instead of complaining about low wages or lack of benefits, he mistakenly shifts the blame

165
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:43,200
on to women wanting equal rights. Al is a reactionary. One of the binds the series puts

166
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:48,160
us in is that Al is also our hero. Although he would remain explicitly anti-woman throughout

167
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,640
the series, what's surprising is to see how the audience very quickly started taking his side of

168
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:57,680
things. In season one, there were still some pushback like with this line. Look, I'm not sexist.

169
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,880
I'm just saying women don't know nothing. This shows us a version of Al that is meant to be a

170
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:07,920
fool to be laughed at, not a hero to be supported. But even in the first few seasons, he wasn't

171
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:13,600
completely unredeemable and he had a few genuinely admirable qualities. Strangely enough, Al has a

172
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,920
number of opportunities to hook up with beautiful women throughout the series, but he manages to

173
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:22,640
stay faithful to peg throughout it all. In the first season episode, Al loses his cherry,

174
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,880
we see Al tempted by one of the many vacuous blondes that will inhabit the series.

175
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Al eventually does the right thing.

176
00:17:47,920 --> 00:18:07,200
He goes back to peg, but he does make it a little creepy.

177
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:20,000
So Al is gross, we all know that, but he shows us some character in this episode,

178
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,400
not cheating on his wife, which, as we can see from peg at home, would really hurt her.

179
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,040
This is about establishing Al, for all his faults, isn't a complete bastard.

180
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,280
What's interesting is how the show presents characters. They're absurd and over the top,

181
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,840
and the cherry sister in particular play into a gross male fantasy of the vacant blonde,

182
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,080
but they're being deployed in a slightly more sophisticated way. The temptation of Al is a

183
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,800
genuine test because it risks the very foundations of the premise, that is, a married couple at the

184
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,920
center of this entire sitcom. The show can't continue if the married couple and married with

185
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:56,480
children are no longer married. The idea behind the comedy here is that Al and Peg don't

186
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,560
mean the nasty things they say to each other, and deep down there's some real love there.

187
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,960
If Al or Peg cheated on the other, it would violate that implication. What this show has

188
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,760
at its core is the idea of a deep love that transcends romance and lust. The fact that it

189
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,880
acknowledges temptation is actually kind of realistic. Al and the Bundys generally are

190
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:19,600
rough people who do bad things, but they aren't completely unredeemable. Funnily enough, this is

191
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,240
how the seed is planted, taking them from being objects of ridicule to underdogs the audience can

192
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,120
cheer for. I also really like this episode because Peg apparently watches my YouTube channel.

193
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:41,840
Thanks, Peggy. The poverty of the Bundys is a huge reason as to why they live so miserably.

194
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:46,400
The Bundys are the traditional nuclear family struggling to survive at a new status quo of the

195
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,960
1980s, and this new reality doesn't have room for the Bundys. Stephen Marcy are part of the

196
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:55,680
new order. The one the Bundys sneer at. The people who move in next door who have a much happier

197
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:00,160
marriage and more successful careers. They aren't massively successful, but they're doing better

198
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,640
than the Bundys. And by the end of the season, they're already looking down at their poor

199
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,680
neighbors. Just like how everyone else looks down on the Bundys. And it must suck to feel like

200
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:15,760
everyone is looking down at you. Thank you, Father Kids. Thanks, Dad. The second season

201
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:20,160
established more of the show's tone, including its tendency to tell absurd stories. It opens

202
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,760
with a two parter that has the Bundys going on vacation to dump water Florida. Upon getting

203
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,040
there, they are attacked by a genuine axe murderer. Kids, get dressed. We're leaving.

204
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,520
But we like it here. Suit yourself, Peg.

205
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,240
Al, we are not leaving the children. Well, what's wrong? There's someone in our room.

206
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:48,480
That's him. And they react in typical Bundy fashion, stealing and kicking ass. It's safe.

207
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,240
Steal everything that's not tied down.

208
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,360
Pack up. We'll go downstairs, get a refund. Hit the road.

209
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,800
Pack this. We can always use a fork.

210
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,480
This is one of the many times we'll be seeing the Bundys doing both of these things. It's a

211
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,600
gentle reminder that while they are our protagonists and aren't as bad as a literal axe murderer,

212
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,520
they're not so great themselves. That again, everyone in the show's world seems to be an

213
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,600
asshole like the townsfolk who let the murderer off so they can keep one of their major tourist

214
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:31,120
attractions. What are you doing? Making sure you didn't hurt him. See Bundy, dump water ain't much

215
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:36,960
of a town. We only got two things, a serial killer and the man who met Andy Griffith.

216
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,280
The Bundys live in a cynical world where everyone is chasing money, something the

217
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,600
Bundys lack. In fact, the only reason Bundys were at this hellhole was because it was the

218
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,720
only vacation they could afford. We can get an example of what wealthier Bundys might be like in

219
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,720
Master the Possibilities. The Bundys mistakenly think they don't have to pay the bill on a

220
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,880
credit card that was accidentally given to Buck, giving them a taste of living the sweet life.

221
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:20,800
It also reveals that they believe a few things about being rich, like it buys you social

222
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:25,440
permission to be a jerk. It's here we see that the Bundys are much happier when they aren't fighting

223
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:35,040
over the few scraps they have. Everyone in the world is obsessed with money, and the Bundys are

224
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:39,200
showing us what happens to a family without any. It's a powerful counterpoint to the obsessive

225
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,920
consumerism of the 1980s. The chase for money makes both the rich and poor much harsher to

226
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,880
everyone around them. One of the memorable moments in season two happens in the episode

227
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,680
You Better Watch Out, where a mall promotion featuring a parachuting Santa went awry.

228
00:22:53,680 --> 00:23:10,400
I really appreciate the contrast and reactions between the roads and the Bundys.

229
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,640
While this might have ruined Christmas for any other family, the Bundys have a rare victory

230
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,040
when they realize Santa's sack was filled with coupons for the new mall. This really captures

231
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,440
the spirit of married with children. Christmas, the traditional family holiday, is really just

232
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,080
about the presents, and the Bundys cut through the sentimental mask that disguises that materialism.

233
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,040
The Bundy house is where Santa goes to die, but he can leave the presents. A fun bit of

234
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:51,280
trivia is that, according to show co-creator Michael Moy, the idea of Santa falling to his

235
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:56,160
death in a failed stunt at Christmas time was taken from the childhood memories of one of the

236
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,000
writers on the show. On second thought, maybe that trivia isn't so much fun. And before leaving

237
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:07,200
season two entirely, it also gave us one of my favorite running gags in the show, The Bundy Cheer.

238
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:27,520
I've purposely avoided talking about another thing married with children was increasingly

239
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:32,480
getting a rep for, and that's having beautiful men and women, although more often than not women,

240
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:37,360
showing some skin. This helped attract the younger demographic Fox had been hunting for,

241
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:42,640
but the network was growing increasingly wary of the salacious imagery and plot lines of the series.

242
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,880
This set the stage for the notorious episode, Her Cup's Runneth Over,

243
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,920
written by Stacy Sprong and Marcy Vosberg. In this episode, Peg's birthday is ruined when

244
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:57,360
she finds out her favorite bra is being discontinued. Alan and Steve go on a road trip to a special

245
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,560
lingerie store in Wisconsin to track down Peg's favorite bra, and engage in some saucy antics

246
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:07,920
featuring women in lingerie. This episode happened to catch the eye of Terri Ricolta,

247
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:12,000
a housewife in Michigan. The story goes that she had been letting her children have free

248
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,400
reign of the television when she noticed they were watching this particular episode of Married

249
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,800
with Children. Ricolta was so upset she was moved to call into the network to complain about the

250
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,440
show. Fox being new to the whole network thing didn't have a department to field complaint

251
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,400
calls. So, amazingly, they forwarded the call to one of the writers responsible for the episode,

252
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,560
Marcy Vosberg. Both women provided their own versions of that conversation.

253
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,200
But we're just trying something a little bit new, and I said, we sort of take a British approach

254
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,080
to censorship. If it's offensive, you can always change the channel. Very condescending tones,

255
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:02,480
she said. You know, this is a body program. We are pushing the envelope of television.

256
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,000
Our viewing audience is an adult, viewer drinking male, 18 to 35 years old. She said, and finally,

257
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,360
Mrs. Ricolta, if you don't like what you're seeing, I suggest to you that you just stand up,

258
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,000
walk over to the television and turn it off. Ricolta, undeterred by the phone call, wrote to

259
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,080
the heads of the various companies advertising their products on Married with Children,

260
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,240
and she convinced many of them to start pulling their ads. Married with Children was being

261
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,200
attacked by a one-woman boycott. An article from the New York Times describes her success.

262
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,280
Proctor and Gamble, McDonald's, Tam Brands, and Kimberly Clark have instructed their advertising

263
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,880
agencies not to buy further time on the program Married with Children. In an interview, the

264
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,280
Michigan woman, Terry Ricolta, said she has objected to the program because of its blatant

265
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:53,440
exploitation of women and sex and anti-family attitudes. But what parts of this episode really

266
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:58,000
bothered Ricolta? I'm going to pick out a handful of the more controversial moments of this episode,

267
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,960
at least in the eyes of someone living in 1988, and I want you to guess which two were the ones

268
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:08,000
that, for Terry Ricolta, crossed the line. Do you know what happened if men had breasts? We wouldn't

269
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:15,200
need women anymore. And if you had what other men have, I wouldn't need batteries anymore.

270
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,360
Don't be embarrassed. We often cater to people like you.

271
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,520
Now, what size does your boyfriend like to see you in?

272
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,560
No, no, no. You don't understand. We're married. And not to each other, too.

273
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,000
And if I was gay, I'd like to think I could do better than him.

274
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,440
Steve, aren't you ashamed of yourself?

275
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,080
Oh, come on, Al. She was asking for it. You see how she's dressed.

276
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,720
Isn't there something we can do about this? We can dance.

277
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
No!

278
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,480
Happy birthday, dragon! If you were my boyfriend, would you like this?

279
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,520
Or do you think he'd like it better, without the bra, like this?

280
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:28,080
Yeah, you're right. I don't need the bra. Well, I gotta go. Bar exam tomorrow.

281
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,640
Okay, so which of those two clips really set off Ricolta?

282
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:43,440
Let's go back to the Times article to find out. In an interview, she said she was

283
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,640
appalled by the sexual innuendo and treatment of women on the program, particularly its references

284
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,720
to homosexuality and a sequence featuring a woman publicly removing her bra. So it was the reference

285
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,720
to gay men and the hand bra. While the hand bra, I can understand, it's pretty chilling to think

286
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,600
mentioning characters might be gay was enough to offend someone. It's a strong reminder of how far

287
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,400
gay rights have come in the last 30 years. The Ricolta boycott, although seemingly a threat at

288
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:15,120
first, backfired pretty spectacularly. It gave Married with Children a national spotlight,

289
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:19,440
and what was already the most popular show on Fox got a huge boost in the ratings from people

290
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,280
coming by to see what all the fuss was about. Here's an excerpt from an Entertainment Weekly

291
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:29,120
article in 1990, one year after the boycott began. The show is as raucous as ever, the audience has

292
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,920
grown, and advertisers are still advertising. A number of sponsors that wrote letters of support

293
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:38,480
to Ricolta have continued to run commercials in Married, some could even be called heavy

294
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:44,880
advertisers. In short, free speech is safe. From Terry Ricolta. Ricolta, who has since formed

295
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,000
Americans for Reasonable Television, a media watchdog organization that publishes a monthly

296
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,120
newsletter for 2,000 subscribers, concedes that her campaign brought more publicity to Married,

297
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:59,840
and probably more viewers. I'm still waiting for that fruit basket from Fox, she says.

298
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:05,120
As the ratings have climbed, so have the rates charged for 30 seconds of commercial time.

299
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,520
Last spring, a half minute went for 65,000. These days, the cost is 100,000 to 120,000,

300
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,520
roughly equal to the rates of an NBC Sunday night movie. It was so hot Married with Children managed

301
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,200
to set a record-breaking increase in viewership. According to Ricolta, her real problem was with

302
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,920
Married with Children airing before 9pm, which apparently made it more likely to find its way

303
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:33,360
in front of younger audiences. At the time, the sitcom had been airing at 8.30pm. Fox did push

304
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,840
it back to 9pm the following season, though it was moving with a significantly larger audience,

305
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,640
and it would grow larger still. The network also had one strange reaction to the boycott.

306
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:47,600
To take the upcoming episode, I'll See You in Court, off the schedule entirely. It was an

307
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,160
episode about the Bundy's and Rhodes' visiting a love motel where their Night of Passion was

308
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:57,040
secretly recorded, leading to a showdown where they take the hotel owners to court.

309
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:01,840
Fox considered this episode too controversial for television, and it didn't air until several

310
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,600
years later, well after the series ended, on June 18th, 2002. Although a decent episode,

311
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:12,400
it didn't really live up to the hype. Season 3 had a few other highlights I want to mention

312
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,560
before moving on. Both Bud and Kelly became more developed as characters in this season.

313
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:21,360
For instance, Bud started committing hair crimes. As a hair choice like this would suggest,

314
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,840
Bud's journey through puberty was a lonely one. From here on out, we'll be seeing Bud,

315
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,320
the relatively intelligent Bundy, feel the need to prove his manhood by hooking up with a girl,

316
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,520
or in the majority of cases, as close as he can get to one.

317
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,640
The day I stoop low enough to date a mannequin

318
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,200
is the day I truly earned the name Bundy.

319
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,440
On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, Kelly proves herself to be very successful in

320
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,520
her dating life, although she also distinguishes herself as the dimmest of the Bundy's.

321
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:21,840
I think this is where Christina Applegate really started to distinguish herself.

322
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,920
Although the Kelly character would be trapped in this endless cycle of being the

323
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,720
dumb blonde who hooks up with countless guys, Applegate was able to deliver her lines with

324
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,520
a refreshing energy that really demonstrated she had a talent for comedy. She'd go on to be one

325
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:39,920
of the breakout stars of the show, and part of it was being able to pull off moments like this one.

326
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:06,880
One of the well-established tropes of this series up to this point is that

327
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,360
Al sees having sex with Peg as a chore.

328
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:30,720
It's not that he doesn't find Peg attractive, because she's lost her looks or anything like

329
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,840
that, it's because she's his wife. It's the routine of sex that has reduced Al's interest

330
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,920
in it, at least with Peggy. To compensate, Peggy uses a variety of schemes that trick Al into bed.

331
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:46,720
Small content warning for sexual violence, because a few of these clips are a bit disturbing.

332
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,760
Skip ahead to the time scene below if you'd like to avoid this section.

333
00:33:49,760 --> 00:34:06,880
While it's typically done through guile or some other form of manipulation,

334
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:11,520
the more problematic aspect of this becomes apparent when roles are reversed in the fourth

335
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:16,240
season premiere. In Hot Off the Grill, Al decides to celebrate Labor Day with a barbecue.

336
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:38,960
Al, using his day off to its fullest, demands Peg start cleaning and doing other chores around

337
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:43,280
the house. This turns out on.

338
00:34:57,600 --> 00:35:02,320
And this happens several times this episode, the running gag being that instead of Al not wanting

339
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:06,640
to have sex, it's Peg who doesn't want to do it because she's just too tired.

340
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,600
Cut out the laughter and applause, and this scene looks dramatically different. Perhaps it might

341
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,240
have seemed like an easier subject for humor when the big strong man is acquiescing to the weaker

342
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:35,200
wife, but that in and of itself is problematic. Non-consensual sex, whether it comes through

343
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,720
physical force or mental manipulation, is sexual assault. Al and Peg have somehow worked it into

344
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,960
their strange marriage, but there's still something very disturbing about making light of it.

345
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,880
Certain aspects of the show have aged surprisingly well, but this isn't one of them. If anything,

346
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:55,600
looking at this from 2020, it often feels more uncomfortable than funny.

347
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:00,560
One major highlight for season 4 was the hour-long special, It's a Bundyful Life. As the name

348
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,360
suggests, it's a married with children take on the classic Christmas movie, It's a Wonderful Life.

349
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,200
Rather than some of the first part myself, I'll let Al's poetry fill you in.

350
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:49,120
In a second half of the story, Al's repairing of the Christmas lights goes wrong.

351
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:04,800
And Al is met by his guardian angel, Sam Kinesen, the very comedian who inspired the

352
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:23,680
character of Al Bundy. As you might have guessed,

353
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,040
Al gets to see what the world would have been like had he not been born.

354
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,880
How we meet the man who takes Al's place.

355
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,600
That's Ted McGinley playing Norman Jablonsky. We'll be seeing more of him in season 5

356
00:37:51,600 --> 00:38:07,680
in a completely different role. Things aren't going well for guardian angel Sam Kinesen.

357
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,440
Turns out it's very difficult to give Al a reason to want to live. Until…

358
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:27,120
they're happy. Not a care in the world. You think I'm going to let that happen

359
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:35,440
after all the grief they put me through? I want to live! And Al returns home.

360
00:38:51,600 --> 00:39:11,520
This was a twist on the It's a Wonderful Life concept that's actually original,

361
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,600
even if it's just an inversion, and what it so beautifully captures is the power of

362
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:19,440
spite to someone in a world they think has turned against them. If someone were to say

363
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,760
the world would be better off if you didn't exist, that can create some real bitterness.

364
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,960
Biting back against that is at the heart of who Al is. He won't go away, even if it would make

365
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,160
the world a better place. This speaks to that aggrieved reactionary narrative so well. The old

366
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,440
status quo being undoubtedly replaced means guys like Al are getting a smaller piece of the pie,

367
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:44,880
or in Al's case, the smaller piece of the pie he was promised in his youth. This wasn't the way

368
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,080
things were supposed to turn out for him. But I need to stress, Al being erased isn't speaking

369
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:55,120
to a reality, just a feeling that it's happening. Married with Children is presenting us the world

370
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,480
through a warped lens, one that sneers at the facade of the happy family that other sitcoms

371
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,560
pretend exist, or at least pretend exist in every home. Married with Children isn't intentionally

372
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,160
pushing an aggrieved white conservative male narrative on purpose, it's that the very conceit

373
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,240
of the series carries that implicit bias. On its original broadcast, this became the highest

374
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:25,360
rated episode of the series, achieving 31.4 million viewers. A major turning point in season 4 was the

375
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,840
growing influence of the Bundys on their neighbors, the Roses, and I don't just mean the increasing

376
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:34,560
animosity between Al and Marcy. But doesn't anybody know this is against the law? So I was

377
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:48,640
dressing up a chicken and calling it your wife. I am not a chicken. Why does he keep calling me a

378
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:56,240
chicken? By the time the fourth season rolls around, the once happy newlyweds are well on

379
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,520
their way to becoming Al and Peg. When I was dating you, I had a few milk bones slipped into my pocket.

380
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:15,360
I was pretty. My mother told me so. Compared to your mother you were. So now you don't like my

381
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:19,520
mother. What's not to like? A 60 year old woman who played the drums. Aside from the bickering,

382
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,880
there was the added pain of Steve getting wrapped up in one of Al's schemes, a shoe themed hotline.

383
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,400
The trial had everything. Crying, that was Mr. Rhodes. He lost his job, you know. And then

384
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:37,200
there was an honest-to-goodness fit. That was Mrs. Rhodes. She got demoted to drive up window teller.

385
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,480
While it seemed like Al was shaping Steve into him, he started to more closely resemble Peggy.

386
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,080
I've been thinking, I don't really want to work.

387
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,400
It's boring. I'm having fun not working. Peggy says, well, Marcy says you're working, leech man.

388
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,240
The degradation of their marriage also reveals more to the Steve and Marcy characters. Their

389
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,080
veneer of tolerant, open-minded liberals is ripped away to reveal, much like the Bundy's, what terms

390
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:14,320
them on is money. I mean, when I first married Steve, he was a greedy, materialistic pig.

391
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:23,360
He'd step on an old lady for a dollar. God, how he excited me. Though they don't quite go full Bundy,

392
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:28,000
they not only have the experience of having had money, but there are no kids to weigh them down.

393
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,840
Marcy becoming Al is very interesting since the bitterness of working a low-paying job is almost

394
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:39,440
instantaneous. This is apparently what low-wage work will do to someone in this world, particularly

395
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,960
if they're in a single-income family and their partner refuses to work. It's taxing not just

396
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:49,840
financially but psychologically. It also shows us the precariousness of the relatively lavish

397
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:54,720
lifestyle of the Roses. They're one firing and demotion away from their lives and marriages

398
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:59,440
crumbling. All of this was setting up the groundwork for the first major change in the show's cast,

399
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,680
the departure of David Garrison. Although there was no bad blood between him or any involved in

400
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,080
the show's production, in his heart, he was primarily a theater actor, and he left to pursue

401
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:13,200
that interest. In the context of the show, Steve's departure would be explained as him running off to

402
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,920
be a park ranger, but he would be back a few more times over the years. Season 4 also gave us one

403
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:20,880
more important first. We finally get to hear Buck speak.

404
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:45,520
Buck has many internal monologues over the years and even a few Buck-centric episodes.

405
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,400
He was voiced by Kevin Carran, a writer for the series. Though in the handful of Buck-centric

406
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,800
episodes, where Buck has more than a handful of lines, he's voiced by Cheech Marin.

407
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,440
Married with Children continued to get even more popular with the start of its fifth season,

408
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,480
which is pretty easy to understand when you look at what other shows were out there.

409
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:29,120
Even the opening to season 5 starts with a great moment that captures what this show is all about.

410
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:47,280
What you may have noticed in many of these clips is how raucous the audience is getting.

411
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,000
Back in season 4 we started getting loud ovations from pretty much every first entrance of a member

412
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:56,640
of the principal cast. Married with Children was very quickly distinguishing itself for having one

413
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,520
of the most vocal audiences. If you listen closely to this clip, you can hear someone shout,

414
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,240
Don't do it.

415
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,840
And this was far from being the only time something like this happened.

416
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:24,080
You can hear the audience shouting out in a number of scenes, and this is my favorite example.

417
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:43,760
How much do people love this show if they're cheering a dog getting a hookup?

418
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:49,440
In an article for New York Magazine, Hollywood sound engineer John Bicklehopped describes his

419
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,880
time on the show. Married with Children, he says, was amazing. I worked on that show for years and

420
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,840
years, and honestly, I had little to do except clean up edits. That owed a lot to careful casting

421
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:04,720
of the crowd. Married, he says, often had audiences packed with Marines and service people who

422
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:16,080
responded to the show's aggressive anti-PC humor. The audience serves as a good indicator of where

423
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:20,960
the show will be heading in the future. The strongest reactions were typically for sexy women

424
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:25,920
or anti-PC humor, and both would become more prominent in later season. Here's an example

425
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,520
from just one season later.

426
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:56,320
The laughter makes sense, but the cheering? Al is supposed to be in the wrong, the out-of-touch

427
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:59,680
loser to be mocked because the audience is supposed to feel as though they're better than

428
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,880
him. But by being the star of a beloved sitcom, all that goodwill is turning him into a folk hero,

429
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:10,640
and Al using a white reactionary victimhood narrative creates an implicit support for that

430
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:15,200
point of view. Season 5 took another big step in the show's evolution with the episode,

431
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:20,080
Married with Who?, where we meet our old friend Ted McGinley, only now he's playing a different

432
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,960
character, Marcy's new husband, Jefferson Darcy. The marriage was a product of a one-night stand.

433
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:53,200
The dynamic here is Jefferson is a mooching, pretty boy conman,

434
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:58,000
leaving off of Marcy's wealth. This wasn't the first time Ted McGinley was a late addition to a

435
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:02,080
sitcom. Before coming to Marry with Children, he joined the cast of both Happy Days and The

436
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:06,400
Love Boat in their later seasons, something that was cutely referenced in later episodes of

437
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:24,960
Married with Children. It took the audience a while to warm up to Jefferson. According to

438
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,600
McGinley, it was about two seasons, but in my opinion I think he fit into the cast quite nicely,

439
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:53,120
right from the get-go. With Married with Children writing so high,

440
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:57,440
it was only natural for Fox to want to capitalize on that success, and that's how we got the first

441
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:02,720
attempt at creating a spin-off. In Oldies But Youngins, we meet Al's friend, Charlie Verducci,

442
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,160
played by Joseph Bologna, whose son is dating Kelly. His name is Vinny, and he's played by a

443
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:27,040
young Matt LeBlanc. A few episodes later, Married with Children would go the extra mile using its

444
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:33,040
100th episode to give audiences a stealth pilot for the spin-off show, Top of the Heap. In this

445
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:37,280
episode, the only regular cast member to appear was Al in a small cameo. The rest of the time,

446
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:42,480
we hang out with the Verducci's, a father-son duo who are trying to hatch a forgettable plot to get

447
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:47,120
rich. There was only one really great moment, and that's the part where Matt LeBlanc pretends to

448
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:53,920
box with Mr. Fluffy the Cat, who performed under his own name. That is such a talented cat. Top

449
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,440
of the Heap would build on this bland episode to premiere on April 7th, 1991. It was the first and

450
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:05,040
most successful of the Married with Children spin-offs, lasting a grand total of six episodes.

451
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,240
Not counting the pilot. A year later, the spin-off somehow got a spin-off of its own, titled Vinny

452
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:15,440
and Bobby, with Matt LeBlanc once again playing Vinny, only now his co-star is Robert Torti,

453
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,960
playing his roommate Bobby Grazo. The show made the disastrous decision to cut out the clear star

454
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,680
of the previous series, Mr. Fluffy the Cat, but it ended up being slightly more successful,

455
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:32,080
blazing past the old series' six-episode run to reach a grand total of seven episodes.

456
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:37,040
For Matt LeBlanc's sake, a year later, he would find himself on Friends and become a big star.

457
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:41,360
Friends, by the way, also featured Christina Applegate, who would guest-star on a few

458
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:46,560
episodes playing Rachel's sister. There's no word of what happened to Mr. Fluffy the Cat, though.

459
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,640
And one last highlight from season five I need to mention is we are introduced to Al's favorite

460
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,160
TV show, a western titled Psychodad.

461
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:32,720
Season six carried the momentum of season five and continued the trend of strong ratings. The

462
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,360
Ricotta controversy was long gone, but another powerful driver of attention for the show was

463
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:43,120
that, with over 100 episodes in its library, it now qualified for syndication. It was voraciously

464
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:48,080
snapped up by networks, as the early seasons in particular had such underwhelming ratings in their

465
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:52,800
initial run that it was like buying a bunch of forgotten episodes for a hit TV series.

466
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,720
This brought in even more new viewers hungry for more married-with-children.

467
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,840
The premiere for season six brought with it a major change.

468
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:24,000
The reaction from the family isn't great.

469
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:47,280
The

470
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,960
plot line was written into the series as, in real life, Katie Seagal was pregnant,

471
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,000
and it let her appear on camera without having to hide that fact.

472
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:58,640
Also, a third child is the exact sort of bad luck that Al would have. Seagal was clearly

473
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:02,560
far along in her pregnancy at the time, and a few months into the new season, she would leave the

474
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,840
series for four episodes. I have to talk about some heavy stuff now, so consider this a content

475
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:12,320
warning, particularly for anyone who's experienced challenges during their own pregnancy or the

476
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,520
pregnancy of a loved one. You can skip ahead to the time below if this is a sensitive topic for you.

477
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,000
Katie Seagal's departure to have her first child took an unfortunate turn. She was six weeks from

478
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:27,040
coming to term when she had to have an emergency caesarean section, and tragically her pregnancy

479
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:32,240
ended in a stillbirth. Normally this type of information would stay private, as it so obviously

480
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,800
should, but Seagal had been public with her pregnancy. To prevent the difficulty of dealing

481
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,400
with questions from a nosy press, she released a statement on what had happened.

482
00:53:47,520 --> 00:54:04,960
Somehow Seagal was able to return to the show less than a month after the experience,

483
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,880
and the pregnancy was quickly written out of the series, with the early episodes revealed to be a

484
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,600
dream Al was having. Naturally, there needed to be a moment where Al is shocked to learn that Peg

485
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:32,560
is no longer pregnant. The kids are awkwardly roped into this scene for this moment because,

486
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:37,040
and this is me speculating, no one wanted to put Katie Seagal in a scene where she even had to

487
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,400
hear references to a missing pregnancy. I think this shows how, behind the scenes, the cast and

488
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,880
crew unmarried with children had a lot of real love and affection for one another, especially

489
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,600
in a difficult time like this. Katie Seagal would become pregnant two more times during the run of

490
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:56,400
the series, and happily both were delivered to term successfully. For obvious reasons, her second

491
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,400
and third pregnancies are never referenced on the show. While Katie Seagal was away from the show,

492
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:05,200
there was another important moment for the series. Mende Burce, who played Marcy, decided to try her

493
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:10,720
hand at directing in the episode titled, If I Could See Me Now, in which Al needs glasses.

494
00:55:10,800 --> 00:55:14,640
Although she would still appear as Marcy until the end of the series, she would go on to direct

495
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:19,920
over 30 episodes of Married with Children. Season 6 also gave us the birth of a new

496
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,760
gimmick Bud would use to attract women. When the hat is on, I'm street rapper Grandmaster B.

497
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:35,920
When it's off, I'm Bud. Got it? Now, the hat is on. Who am I?

498
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:40,640
Oh, cheer up, Buttwagger B. Why, it's Grandfather B.

499
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,840
They're there, Crossdresser B. I'm really sorry, Grand Marshal B.

500
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,200
Gasp, passer, bassmaster. What's the difference?

501
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,880
Even after the first 10 episodes of the season are revealed to have been a dream,

502
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,640
as a convenient way of writing Peg and Marcy's pregnancies out of the show,

503
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:02,320
the Grandmaster B persona manages to survive. Do you also call yourself street rapper Grandmaster B?

504
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:05,360
Or was that a dream? Oh, come on, Daddy.

505
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:08,400
Even Bud's not pathetic enough to- Hey, this is a Grandmaster B.

506
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,680
Chicks would be all over me. I could wear my hat backwards.

507
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:16,560
Oh man, I'm gonna go write my first rap right now.

508
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:22,240
This gimmick was inspired by real life, where David Fosino was trying to be a rapper

509
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:29,120
under the name Dee Lil. Fosino released an album titled Ballistics, which spawned one single titled

510
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:33,920
I Told Ya. I couldn't find any sales information for this album, but since there was no follow-up,

511
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:39,040
I assume it wasn't quite as popular as the Joey Lawrence album from the same time period.

512
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,800
I don't want to get any copyright claims for playing some of Dee Lil's single,

513
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,760
so I'm gonna rap a few bars for you. Here we go.

514
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:50,160
So you wick-wack, knick-knack, tick-tack, skip back.

515
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,960
I got the funky style and you know you can't get with that.

516
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:55,600
I got more flavor than the bar candy kit, cat.

517
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:58,480
And when it comes to kitty cats, I gotta have the Jimmy hats.

518
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:01,680
Yeah, that was the song.

519
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:07,680
Season 6 also brought us the first return of Steve Rhodes in The Egg and Eye.

520
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,000
In this episode, Steve has stolen a rare hawk egg,

521
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:13,840
but when he comes back for Marcy, he finds out she's moved on.

522
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:15,680
I came to reclaim my wife.

523
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:21,840
I wouldn't crawl to you if I had a date with Mel Gibson and you had the last diaphragm on Earth.

524
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:28,480
Because we had one, two, three, four, five, seven kids.

525
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:33,680
Season 7 is often cited as the season where everything started to take a bad turn.

526
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,280
It was during the season that one of the show's co-creators, Michael Moy,

527
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:40,880
left the series, leaving Ron leave it to hold it together on his own.

528
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:44,400
This season also had the Bundy clan receive a new addition,

529
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,040
Seven, played by Shane Sweet.

530
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,480
Adding a cute kid to the cast has been a gimmick on TV sitcoms for decades,

531
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:54,800
and I can't think of a single time where it worked, at least in the long term.

532
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,440
Seven, the son of Peggy's hillbilly cousins,

533
00:57:57,440 --> 00:58:01,600
is abandoned to the Bundy family because, as bad as life is for the Bundy's,

534
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:05,920
Peggy's side of the family, the wankers, were in an even worse state.

535
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:08,560
Although Peg would display some surprising maternal instincts,

536
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,720
the audience was less keen on Seven.

537
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:13,680
The show tried its best to bring Seven into the fold with the episode,

538
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:18,000
Every Bundy Has a Birthday, where the family goes to the park to celebrate Seven's birthday.

539
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:21,520
Sadly, being poor, they apparently don't get to use the public park.

540
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,600
The family bonds the only way they know how, by beating the crap out of another family.

541
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,400
There's a lot of ass-kicking in this show.

542
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,680
We saw a similar fight in the season 5 opener, We'll Follow the Sun.

543
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,680
Honey?

544
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,880
Jerry, don't you have anything better to do than to pick a fight with a moron?

545
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,320
Just who are you calling moron?

546
00:58:58,320 --> 00:58:59,440
Your husband.

547
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,640
You painted hus-

548
00:59:03,120 --> 00:59:04,960
And countless other episodes.

549
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,440
Sadly for Seven, even this show of family solidarity wasn't enough,

550
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,920
and he'd leave the cast before the end of the season.

551
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,960
He mysteriously vanished in the episode, Peggy and the Pirates,

552
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:17,520
where Peggy tells him a thrilling story about pirates,

553
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,840
including another guest appearance by David Garrison.

554
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:23,680
This was a really fun episode, we get to see Peg fall for Pirate Owl,

555
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:28,080
Peg gets to be a bit of a badass, and all sorts of fun pirate capers.

556
00:59:39,120 --> 00:59:44,240
Peg finishes her story, and she's shoes Seven away, and we never see him again.

557
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:47,280
But we do get a very tiny Seven cameo in season 8,

558
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,080
kinda.

559
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:51,120
And before we leave season 7, in this episode titled Christmas,

560
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,360
we get a flashback of a very young Buck.

561
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,960
There's no commentary here, I just wanted to show you Puppy Buck.

562
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:11,280
Behind the scenes, in late 1993, Amanda Burz's sexuality jumped into the headlines when she

563
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:13,760
finally went public with the fact that she was gay.

564
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:34,240
At the time, Burz was the only network star who was out,

565
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:38,400
and this happened four years before Ellen DeGeneres would come out in 1997.

566
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:42,240
I suspect the low opinion critics had of Married with Children may have colored

567
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,200
their reactions to this moment, garnering less publicity.

568
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,640
As for representations of gay characters on the show, Married with Children had one

569
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:53,520
episode featuring a gay character back in season 5 in the episode titled The Dance Show.

570
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,840
Peggy meets a handsome stranger at a dance club, hoping to trigger some of Al's jealousy.

571
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,600
It doesn't really work, and Al sits at home unbothered and happy,

572
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,760
until Peggy's dancing partner's husband comes knocking at the door.

573
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:20,000
First off, yes, that is Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, playing Pete.

574
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,080
And yes, he did say husband, even though gay marriage was still decades away.

575
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:28,000
That, in and of itself, is a powerful statement about gay relationships.

576
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:32,240
But I want to focus on Al's reactions to this. This moment could have gone so many ways,

577
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,240
and of course we begin with Al being very confused. But as he gets to know Pete,

578
01:01:36,240 --> 01:01:37,760
we see a surprising reaction.

579
01:01:42,240 --> 01:02:10,480
Al, motivated by Pete's cooking, storms off to the dance club and confronts Pete's husband.

580
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,960
Not because Peggy's scheme to make him jealous has worked,

581
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:15,920
but because he's fighting for this gay marriage to stay together.

582
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:40,320
So we have Al Bundy, a man who hates his own marriage and will help tear down anyone else's,

583
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:44,480
standing up to protect a gay marriage. There's something powerful about that,

584
01:02:44,480 --> 01:02:49,440
and surprisingly socially progressive. The show does end on a sour note though.

585
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:07,520
When it comes to sexism and misogyny, the show was not quite so enlightened.

586
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:12,320
Season 8 brought us one of the most popular and one of the most problematic elements of the show,

587
01:03:12,320 --> 01:03:19,360
the anti-feminist group named National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood, or

588
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:25,840
No-Mam. They debuted in an episode appropriately titled No-Mam. In this episode, Al and his buddies

589
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,160
are dismayed to find out that their regular bowling night has been replaced by a women's only night

590
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:35,040
thanks to the efforts of Jerry Springer. Al's reaction is less than in light.

591
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:53,920
This is indicative of a lot of small cracks Al makes when he feels threatened or challenged.

592
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:58,400
It's a low-key homophobia that undoes a lot of the positive stuff we see in episodes like

593
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,720
the dance show. Eventually, Al and his buddies try to ease their pain by going to their favorite

594
01:04:02,720 --> 01:04:07,360
strip club, which they lovingly refer to as the Nudie Bar. When they get there though,

595
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:12,880
it's been turned into a woman's coffee house. So Al does what any man upset with losing a place

596
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:23,920
to hang out on a Thursday night would do. He forms an activist group. Eventually,

597
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:26,640
Marcy docks his Al and they get into a YouTube debate.

598
01:04:37,040 --> 01:04:41,280
What's really interesting here is hearing the audience take sides when Marcy and Al's debate

599
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,480
reaches a crescendo.

600
01:04:53,920 --> 01:05:08,720
The episode ends with Al being arrested, because he's a loser and will always lose.

601
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:12,800
But what happened here was a major meeting between the audience's love for Al and the

602
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:17,680
reactionary conservative worldview he represents. We've spent so long sympathizing with Al,

603
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:21,920
including forgiving the theft in line, so why not cheer on his anti-woman group?

604
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,480
Even taken most generously, Al is arguing against the idea that women are trying to

605
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:31,840
take over the world to subjugate men. But his evidence is pretty thin. He lost one night of

606
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:36,240
the week to bull, and his strip club is turned into a coffee shop. The latter seems more a

607
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:40,320
product of capitalism wanting to appeal to a market outside of horny men. It's not much of

608
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:45,440
a global feminist takeover. If this was a one-off episode, it'd be fine, but we're going to see

609
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,440
more of No Mem in the future. It was a huge hit with the audience married of children had

610
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:53,680
cultivated, one that saw Al as more of a hero to be cheered than a loser to be laughed at.

611
01:05:58,320 --> 01:06:01,440
A major change for this season was the introduction of Al's co-worker,

612
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:06,240
Griff, played by Harold Sylvester. Season 8 had tried and failed to give Al a co-worker to

613
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:11,520
play off of at the shoe store, first with the much younger Aaron, who lasted about five episodes,

614
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:16,720
and the very short-lived Dexter, who only lasted a single episode. Neither of them had the staving

615
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:21,120
power of Griff, who would never join the principal cast, but would be a recurring character on many

616
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:25,520
episodes for the rest of the series' run. As you might have noticed, he's one of the first major

617
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,760
characters to be a person of color. Although technically Officer Dan appeared earlier in the

618
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:34,560
series, he didn't get a name until season 8, and only appeared on roughly a dozen episodes. Griff

619
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:39,120
would appear in over 40. While this might seem like the perfect vehicle to explore race and some

620
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:43,920
issues around that, if you think this has any chance to happening, you've obviously come to the wrong

621
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,720
show. Instead, we get a different kind of inclusivity, where Al's diverse group feels distinctly

622
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:53,760
post-racial, something that might have passed for liberalism back in the day. And Griff, like

623
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:58,800
all of Al's friends, becomes a member of Nomam to show a multicultural front against women. And

624
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:03,760
Nomam was out in full force this season, first with a two-parter where they took a stand against

625
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:08,720
breastfeeding in public. This two-parter introduced us to a number of characters that would populate

626
01:07:08,720 --> 01:07:19,520
this series' world. First was the Hispanic reporter named, um, yeah, that. And as the only

627
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:24,400
recurring Hispanic character on the show, her being a capable journalist who seems constantly

628
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:30,160
exasperated by the nonsense around her, seems like a nice positive. Although 90% of her character is

629
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:35,200
just her sane, her complicated name. The second half of this two-parter introduced the owner of

630
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:42,080
Al's shoe store, Gary, who, shockingly, is not a man. And we see Al do the unthinkable,

631
01:07:42,080 --> 01:07:56,000
grovel to a woman. This expanding world, with more guys joining Al's anti-woman group,

632
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,040
like Bob Rooney and Ike, are being offset by female characters who think they're a bunch of

633
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:07,680
idiots. The lines are being drawn in this world. At the time, Nomam was so popular that E.E. Bell,

634
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:12,640
the actor who played Bob Rooney, started a website that would let fans across the country register

635
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:18,480
their own Nomam groups. You write into me, tell me who your head honcho is, and who the other

636
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:24,080
guys in your branch are, and I'll list them on a webpage. And that lasted about a year and a half

637
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:29,760
until I got to where it was like two hours a night for me to just do the emails on this,

638
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:34,320
although Nomam mania was taking off, serious co-creator Michael Moy,

639
01:08:34,320 --> 01:08:37,840
who returned to the show this season, wasn't too bothered by what that might mean.

640
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:55,440
Moy even pitched a Nomam spinoff, though network executives balked at the idea of giving this

641
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:59,600
group of characters a show of their own and didn't get nearly as far as other failed spinoff

642
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:04,480
attempts. Speaking of failed spinoffs, this season featured another one, this one titled

643
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:08,720
Radio Free Tremaine, which tried to get a show about a college radio station off the ground.

644
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:13,200
It was notable for two things. The first, that it featured the return of David Garrison, once again

645
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:17,840
playing Steve Rhodes. And second, in that it featured a very young Carrie Russell before she

646
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:23,040
would star in Felicity. This spinoff never even got the courtesy of a six-episode run.

647
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,280
It was dead with the pilot. This will be David Garrison's last appearance on the series,

648
01:09:27,280 --> 01:09:30,720
though I prefer to remember him from his appearance a few episodes earlier in

649
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:38,960
Get the Dodge Outta Hell, where he got one of the longest ovations in the series' history.

650
01:09:53,040 --> 01:10:00,640
Ron Leavitt, Siri's co-creator, left Married with Children for good after the ninth season.

651
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,520
He would move over to the WB, where he would help put together a Married with Children-esque sitcom

652
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:11,280
named Unhappily Ever After. A modest success, reaching 100 episodes, but it was fittingly

653
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,120
called a Married with Children ripoff. Without a doubt, the most difficult

654
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:21,040
change in season 10 was one surrounding, beloved family dog, Buck. We could see Buck getting older

655
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:25,520
in previous seasons as he was slowly going blind and suffering some cognitive delay.

656
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:31,360
I've got to prove to him that I'm not senile. I know. I'll bury a bone. That'll show him.

657
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,560
Now, if I can just find a bone...

658
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:40,880
Excuse me, madam.

659
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:47,680
In season 10, this all came to a head in the tragically titled, Requiem for a Dead Briard.

660
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:53,440
The episode opens with us learning that Buck has passed away. Luckily, this is merely Buck,

661
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:58,400
the TV character, not the real dog, who got to appear in this episode where he goes to heaven.

662
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:03,520
But this dog won't be going to heaven. He instead gets reincarnated as a puppy named Lucky.

663
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,320
And this dog's family is... well...

664
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:13,120
Those voices sound oddly familiar. If I could just get these newborn eyes to focus...

665
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:15,440
I'm your baby.

666
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:20,400
Noooooo!

667
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:24,640
This episode isn't much, but it ends on a sweet note from the producers wishing the dog who played

668
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:30,320
Buck, also named Buck, the best of luck in his retirement. According to show co-creator Michael

669
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,960
Moy, there was some concern over Buck as he was already 12 years old and was experiencing pain

670
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:38,960
having to go up and down the stairs, so they thought it best that he be set free to enjoy

671
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:45,040
some much deserved rest. Later interviews with Buck reveal a possible sore point between him

672
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:49,600
and Lucky. I have nothing to say about Lucky. Buck's replacement Lucky would continue to be

673
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:54,480
voiced by Kevin Carran throughout the season, though by the 11th the internal monologues would

674
01:11:54,480 --> 01:12:00,400
be dropped entirely. As for Buck, sadly he would pass away a week after the 10th season ended,

675
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:04,960
hopefully in a happy place, and he will be fondly remembered as a very good boy.

676
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:10,640
Married with Children was a trailblazer that included a few instances of trans representation.

677
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:15,600
Although a smaller role in season 9's Dud Bowl, we met the quarterback from Al's high school

678
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:20,240
football team. We get the obligatory shocked moment from her former teammates, including a

679
01:12:20,240 --> 01:12:25,600
very creepy move by Al. But generally the characters are pretty cool with it, particularly Peggy and

680
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:32,320
Marcy. And what's she doing here? I am here in support of my sister in arms, Dad. I hope that

681
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:37,520
she wins and somehow you don't. Dad is able to take her old position of quarterback and is

682
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,200
generally welcomed on the team. She not only gets to throw what would have been the winning

683
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:46,240
touchdown, had Al not messed it up, but she even gets to punch out a transphobe. I'm sad.

684
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:50,480
I'm Thor.

685
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,880
Still got your arm, Dad? You make the call.

686
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:09,840
This was fairly ahead of the curve for 1994. Season 10 gave us another trans character.

687
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:13,840
Once again a trans woman, but this time instead of a cis man wearing a wig,

688
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:18,800
this character was played by a cis female, Krista Allen. She's a student at Bud's college,

689
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,280
who he's trying to convince to pose for a pin-up calendar. We don't find out the truth about her

690
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,640
until the end. It's time for my family and the rest of the world to see the person I've become.

691
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:34,480
Bud Bundy has made me proud to be a woman who was born a man.

692
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,720
Although we only ever find out this character is trans at the very end, as a punchline,

693
01:13:40,720 --> 01:13:44,800
what's interesting is how the show handles it. This could have led to some transphobic commentary,

694
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:50,640
but instead we get silence. The message here is pretty clear that society isn't ready for a trans

695
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,000
woman and the shock is overwhelming for these average cis men. Is it overtly transphobic though?

696
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,720
This episode firmly establishes that sexual attraction is entirely possible between cis

697
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:05,520
and trans people if only cis characters were going to ignore their prejudices. It also,

698
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:09,920
at the very least, makes trans people visible, not pretending they don't exist.

699
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:15,200
But the unspoken side of things does highlight the dark side of trans acceptance in the mid-90s.

700
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:20,880
It couldn't be overtly protrans, and in that silence basic anti-trans assumptions reign supreme.

701
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:25,600
Calendars fail, the guys are grossed out, and Bud is embarrassed, having made out with a trans

702
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:31,200
woman. It makes my evaluation of, it could have been worse, seem a bit tepid. Also though we did

703
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:36,000
get two trans women characters in Married with Children, I didn't see any trans men, a group

704
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:40,480
that suffered greatly from a lack of visibility, and that's still a problem we deal with today.

705
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:45,520
The last note I have on season 10 is the final attempt at a spin-off for the series, this time

706
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:50,560
Enemies, a rough parody of Friends, starring Nicole Eggert and Matt Borlangi.

707
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:54,400
It wasn't very good, aside from watching the Darcy's try to speak to a black person.

708
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,840
Yeah, but he's not here, so it's a no, Bundy!

709
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,280
Final season of the show ended things more on a whimper than a bang. Both of the show's creators

710
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:29,600
had left at this point, and Fox showed a lack of care for the health of the series by moving its

711
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:34,720
time slot several times throughout the season. A devastating move in an era when time slots created

712
01:15:34,720 --> 01:15:38,960
predictability for an audience so they could manage their time in a way that let them watch

713
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:43,840
their favorite shows. Ratings started to drop dramatically, and rising production costs meant

714
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:48,480
this season would be the show's last. Not that anyone involved with the production had any idea.

715
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,960
With the series' creators both gone, Married with Children was without either of the voices

716
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:58,480
that had guided it through the previous seasons. Al and Peg, who for the first time in 11 seasons

717
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:04,480
break things off in a three-parter titled Breaking Up is Easy to Do. In it, a typical marital spat

718
01:16:04,480 --> 01:16:09,920
where Al reveals that he's forgotten the first time he and Peg had sex eventually leads to disaster.

719
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:15,680
It sure is. I'm moving out, Peg. And much like that empty promise to shave those shoulders,

720
01:16:15,680 --> 01:16:21,120
I'll believe it when I see it. You'll be wishing you had these shaggy shoulders to cry on Peg.

721
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:25,360
We then see Al and Peg try to enjoy their lives as single people.

722
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:34,960
Al eventually tries to win back Peg from her new boyfriend, Bruce, played by Alan Thicke.

723
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:39,360
Gee, Peg, you really have a new boyfriend.

724
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,160
Well, this is an awkward moment. Fortunately, I'm so self-centered it's not going to bother me.

725
01:16:48,160 --> 01:16:51,760
When the kids find out their new stepdad expects them to get jobs,

726
01:16:51,760 --> 01:16:54,160
they use some Bundy Cell rhetoric to get rid of him.

727
01:16:54,160 --> 01:17:02,400
And eventually, Al and Peg patch things up.

728
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:08,960
A surprisingly sweet episode, at least for any other season, but season 11 was unusually sweet

729
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:13,520
overall. Maybe it was the show's creators being gone for good, but the show definitely felt like

730
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:18,640
it lost much of its cynical edge at this point. While no one wants to see Al and Peg split up,

731
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,720
the way they got back together seemed almost muddlin'. It could have worked in any other

732
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:27,920
season, but this one was already so filled with sentimental moments that it just got lost in a

733
01:17:27,920 --> 01:17:32,880
sea of sappiness. At least, by Married with Children standards. The last two-parter of the

734
01:17:32,880 --> 01:17:37,840
series, often mistakenly thought of as the finale, features Kelly falling in love with a rich man,

735
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,520
Lonnie, played by Charles Esten. They meet when Lonnie's soon-to-be ex takes the Bundy family

736
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:54,400
hostage. Lonnie very quickly proposes.

737
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:24,160
Kelly soon gives up her promiscuous ways. But Al learns that Lonnie doesn't respect

738
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:36,400
Kelly after seeing him at the nudie bar. But eventually, Lonnie makes a move on

739
01:18:36,400 --> 01:18:41,280
Marcy and everything begins to crumble.

740
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:13,760
This would have been a fitting finale. The institution of marriage is upheld as requiring

741
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:19,360
love and not being an expression of temporary lust. We get some Bund unity and some commentary

742
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:24,720
on the rich seeing people as disposable commodities, even husbands and wives. While the poor stay

743
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:28,800
together because they need one another to get through tough times. Marriage is something you

744
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:33,280
should only do if you can withstand the challenge. Not a bad sentiment, but some marriages should end

745
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,440
and the fact that poor people have to cling together to withstand those bad times, as seen

746
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,520
in the many ways the Bundies band together to fight outside threats, keeps these toxic

747
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:47,120
relationships going. Or more accurately, makes these loving relationships toxic. When you're in

748
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:51,600
a loving unit, embattled by the harsh world around you, it's hard not to let some of that harsh world

749
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:55,840
seep inside yourself and affect the people around you. It would have been a decent enough ending,

750
01:19:55,840 --> 01:20:00,960
but there would be one more episode for the series. A forgettable caper involving Al bartering shoes.

751
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:12,080
All of the episode did end on a pretty cool final scene.

752
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:27,760
Married with Children came to an end.

753
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:31,200
Someone else heard it on the radio and then called me

754
01:20:31,760 --> 01:20:38,320
to tell me that the show was canceled. I'm like wow 11 years and I find out from Mark and Brian

755
01:20:38,320 --> 01:20:42,560
that's that's a trip. I was in Ohio at a bed and breakfast and a honeymoon couple

756
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:46,800
approached me in the parking lot as I was getting in my car and said, I'm sorry Dr. Shaw.

757
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:55,280
I said really? Oh you didn't know it's on fee it was canceled. So I said oh really? So I took

758
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:59,520
you got married. I took him in the bottom and drank a little champagne. I said I prefer to

759
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:06,480
hear it from you. You think a show that ran as long as it did that had the impact that it had

760
01:21:06,480 --> 01:21:11,200
on launching a network might have been sent off with a little more hurrah but you know

761
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:17,040
business is business. So we never got a final episode which I thought was extremely unfair

762
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:21,920
seeing as we were one of the first shows there. I mean we were at the network before the Simpsons

763
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:26,480
were there. Although we never got a final episode the cast did share a few of their ideas of how it

764
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:34,880
all should have ended. I'd like to see everybody blown up. Al wins the lottery and uh for like

765
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:40,480
20 million you pick a number and they're dancing around in the living room and like a tornado

766
01:21:40,480 --> 01:21:45,680
comes in like like the Wizard of Oz you know and then all that's left is a big hole. And the house

767
01:21:45,680 --> 01:21:51,200
comes back down on you know Marcy's body and you just see her little feet coming out. Whatever would

768
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:57,440
happen Jefferson would end up by himself on an island with a you know a cocktail an umbrella

769
01:21:57,440 --> 01:22:05,040
and several bikini-clad women and uh living the good life and the rest of them would be you know

770
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:10,880
hell somewhere. That's one desperate little chimp huh. The through line of the series I found most

771
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:15,200
prominent was the evolution of Al going from the loser the audience laughed at to the loser

772
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:19,680
audience grew to love and support and while Al himself changed very little the audience around

773
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:24,320
him seemed to more closely align with how he saw the world. I don't think married with children

774
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:28,880
mainstreamed reactionary politics though. More likely I think it attracted people already

775
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:34,160
inclined towards them. The serious tact to the very real feelings people had and continue to have.

776
01:22:34,160 --> 01:22:38,080
The feelings of people who once felt the world was their birthright suddenly realizing that

777
01:22:38,080 --> 01:22:42,080
life isn't going to turn out the way they thought it would. In that way married with children can

778
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:46,320
help contextualize this feeling in a way that perhaps isn't helpful when it's just being mocked.

779
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:50,480
Sure we can laugh at how silly Al and the other Bundys are but can we not want them to do better

780
01:22:50,480 --> 01:22:55,040
too and maybe do better in a way that isn't just tearing down the people around them. Maybe it can

781
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:58,720
help motivate us to try and make a better world where people won't feel a connection to families

782
01:22:58,720 --> 01:23:03,200
like the Bundys. As much as we like to pretend these bitter feelings of the Bundys don't exist

783
01:23:03,200 --> 01:23:07,440
they have a way of encroaching into our lives and that's what this show does so well. It screams at

784
01:23:07,440 --> 01:23:12,400
the audience letting us know that these people exist they live amongst us and to some of us it

785
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:17,520
may be downright relatable. And as a small coda to that though there is a wonderful irony in a show

786
01:23:17,520 --> 01:23:21,920
giving voice to the voiceless reactionary working-class white man even though there aren't many

787
01:23:21,920 --> 01:23:27,280
characters like the Bundys on TV they still got to have a show. Other marginalized groups even some

788
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:33,120
depicted on the show weren't so lucky. I've often heard it said that shows like Married with Children

789
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:38,400
could never be put on the air today because of how politically correct everything is. That's sort of

790
01:23:38,400 --> 01:23:42,560
true but the only reason it got on the air in the 80s was because it slipped through the cracks of

791
01:23:42,560 --> 01:23:47,760
an upstart network. Married with Children in many ways set the tone for Vox being raunchy and rude

792
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,640
it paved the way for future unconventional sitcoms such as The Simpsons and Malcolm in the Middle with

793
01:23:52,640 --> 01:23:57,680
their unconventional takes on the family dynamic. The stars of the show mostly had success following

794
01:23:57,680 --> 01:24:02,320
the end of the series. Ed O'Neill started a handful of projects and it was at one point nearly cast

795
01:24:02,320 --> 01:24:07,360
as Al Swearingen on HBO's Deadwood. Role had actually been written for him by the series creator

796
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:11,920
but apparently his time on Married with Children had too closely associated him with Al Bundy,

797
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:16,880
a running theme over the years in his career. O'Neill did eventually get cast on Modern Family

798
01:24:16,880 --> 01:24:21,840
which went on to run for 11 seasons just like Married with Children although Modern Family

799
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:26,880
was a few episodes shorter when it ended in 2020. Also one of my favorite fun facts about Ed O'Neill

800
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:32,320
is his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is in front of a shoe store. Katie Skoll would go on to

801
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:36,480
appear in a number of shows including 8 Simple Rules where she starred opposite John Ritter for

802
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:41,600
3 seasons. She probably had her most lauded performance though as Gemma in Sons of Anarchy

803
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,200
which ran for 7 seasons. I'll probably remember her most fondly as the voice of Leela on Futurama.

804
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:11,040
Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need.

805
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,240
Mouthwash, a back wax, and stain proof underwear.

806
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:21,520
Christina Applegate was the breakout star after Married with Children ended. She starred in

807
01:25:21,520 --> 01:25:25,760
Jesse, Samantha Who, Up All Night, and a number of other roles on TV and film

808
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:31,040
but she never quite landed in a project that made use of her talents. However, she did have one very

809
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:35,760
important triumph. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 she would undergo a double

810
01:25:35,760 --> 01:25:40,720
mastectomy. Quite happily she was able to make a recovery and is currently cancer free. Most

811
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:46,000
recently she's starring in the Netflix series Dead to Me. David Faustino's career post Married with

812
01:25:46,000 --> 01:25:50,640
Children has been a bit more low key. Although he did have the singular honor of working alongside

813
01:25:50,640 --> 01:25:58,560
John Bon Jovi in 2006's National Lapoons Pucked, he did star in his own original web series Starving

814
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:02,880
which ran for two seasons and featured cameos from Married with Children Castmates.

815
01:26:02,960 --> 01:26:07,840
Faustino currently works as a DJ. Amanda Burst would transition into a directorial role

816
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:12,560
only occasionally taking a few small acting jobs. She eventually moved east leaving Hollywood and

817
01:26:12,560 --> 01:26:16,640
most of the world of show business behind her. Of all the cast members she seems the least connected

818
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:20,800
to her previous role. David Garrison's return to the world of theater saw him starring in a number

819
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:25,040
of productions though most notably he played the wizard in the Broadway production of Wicked.

820
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:29,520
Though he would often get called back to the world of TV to do a few guest spots under his programs

821
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:33,680
he managed to split his time appearing in a number of different stage productions as well.

822
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:40,000
Burst and Garrison had a very weird cameo together in 2001 on the TV series Nikki. The series starred

823
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:46,000
Nikki Cox who got her first major role on Unhappily Ever After which was created by Married

824
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:50,880
with Children co-creator Ron Levitt. Burst and Garrison reprised the roles as the Rhodeses.

825
01:26:51,920 --> 01:26:56,720
Ted McGinley would continue his lengthy career on TV most notably joining a sitcom at the beginning

826
01:26:56,720 --> 01:27:01,840
of its run for a change when he starred alongside Faith Ford and Kelly Ripa in Hope and Faith.

827
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:06,720
More recently he seems to have cashed in on the Christian movie circuit appearing in films such as

828
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:12,320
Christmas with a capital C, Do You Believe, and God's Not Dead, A Light in Darkness.

829
01:27:13,200 --> 01:27:18,480
The show's co-creator Ron Levitt sadly passed away in 2008 of lung cancer. The last project he

830
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:24,240
worked on was the WB's The Help. He's survived by his two children and his partner who he met while

831
01:27:24,240 --> 01:27:28,400
filming Married with Children. Michael Moy, the other co-creator of the show, has largely left

832
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,320
the world of show business. He very much felt like the encroachment of political correctness

833
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:37,760
was stifling the brand of comedy he enjoyed so for his own sanity he retired and currently lives

834
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:45,200
happily with his family. You know I can't write a sitcom or any type of comedy if I now have to

835
01:27:45,200 --> 01:27:52,480
factor in that this just may offend someone because I've always thought by its very nature

836
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:59,280
comedy has to kind of be slightly offensive. It doesn't have to be mean-spirited. You don't

837
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,600
sit there and just tear down someone. Though there have been rumblings about a Married with

838
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:10,400
Children reboot, most notably one rumored in 2016 starring David Faustino, it hasn't quite materialized.

839
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:14,000
From what little I could find about the subject, there seems to be some kind of legal dispute

840
01:28:14,000 --> 01:28:18,640
around Ron Levitt's estate preventing it from happening. With much of the cast available,

841
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:22,560
aside from possibly Christina Applegate, it seems like the perfect time for a reunion.

842
01:28:23,120 --> 01:28:27,200
So far that just doesn't seem to be in the cards though. Married with Children would live on in

843
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:31,120
the world of syndication for decades but it also found life around the world and the number of

844
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:35,520
international versions of the show. They were married with children remakes from over a dozen

845
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:40,320
countries. The UK version gave us the rare treat of an American show being shipped overseas to be

846
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:46,880
ruined by local TV producers. Here's an excruciating clip. With what I earn, I keep you in bleach,

847
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:50,240
I keep you in binoculars, I keep you instead of someone I'd rather be married to

848
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:55,440
and I pay my national insurance for a nice little pension at the end of it all.

849
01:28:55,440 --> 01:28:59,840
At school they said by the time you retire there won't be any state pensions.

850
01:28:59,840 --> 01:29:01,520
You're not going to come and live with us are you dad?

851
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:10,880
Did I tell you today that I love you? No. Exactly. So why should I choose to live with you when I can

852
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:16,400
sleep rough and die of exposure? The UK series mercifully only lasted seven episodes. The other

853
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:21,200
versions had varying degrees of success though none did as well as the Russian version which ran

854
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:28,160
for six seasons totaling 365 episodes. The series adapted episodes from the original version of the

855
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:32,400
show but when they ran out they had a contest where fans sent in their own original ideas.

856
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:36,480
They even managed to get a few original episodes from the original writing staff of the American

857
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:42,080
version of Married with Children. Al Bundy will go down in history as an iconic TV character as

858
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:47,120
part of a series that shaped a network and took the sitcom format in a bold new direction.

859
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:52,320
It's a series of its time that's somehow timeless so long as there is an angry man sitting on his

860
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:58,160
couch bitter that the world just isn't what it used to be. Al Bundy will speak to that person.

861
01:29:58,160 --> 01:30:02,640
There's one popular clip of the show on YouTube where Al Bundy sums up his life in depressing

862
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:09,200
fashion. It's taken from a season three episode. He thought he could. Every morning when I wake up

863
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:15,760
I know it's not going to get any better until I go back to sleep again. So I get up, have my

864
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:22,480
watered down tang and still frozen pop tart, get in my car with no upholstery no gas and six more

865
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:28,640
payments to fight traffic just for the privilege of putting cheap shoes on the cloven hooves of

866
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:35,840
people like you. I'll never play football like I thought I would. I'll never know the touch of a

867
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:41,200
beautiful woman and I'll never again know the joy of driving without a bag on my head.

868
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:49,680
But I'm not a loser because despite it all, me and every other guy who will never be what he

869
01:30:49,680 --> 01:30:55,360
wanted to be are still out there being what we don't want to be 40 hours a week for life.

870
01:30:56,800 --> 01:31:02,880
And the fact that I haven't put a gun in my mouth you pudding of a woman makes me a winner.

871
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:12,640
The speech is the moment that takes Al from the loser we laugh at to the loser we cheer for.

872
01:31:12,640 --> 01:31:17,440
This sort of speech would fall flat to deaf ears but for one of Al's fellow travelers or one who

873
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:23,280
just admires his gumption it's the bitter scream to the world to remind them that people like Al

874
01:31:23,280 --> 01:31:28,880
still exist. They're here and they're daring us with the question what are you gonna do about it?

875
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:37,680
This was by far the largest project I've ever worked on. It is not only the longest script,

876
01:31:37,680 --> 01:31:45,200
it is the most content I've ever had to watch for a video. Nearly 260 episodes of television and

877
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:51,280
multiple TV specials, news articles, and all sorts of behind the scenes bits of information that I

878
01:31:51,280 --> 01:31:56,320
had to consume for this one. It was made possible by the generous donations of my patrons whose

879
01:31:56,320 --> 01:32:00,240
names you can see on the screen now. If you'd like to be one of these fine people you can head

880
01:32:00,240 --> 01:32:06,240
over to my patreon and donate. Five dollar tier will also get you a download of my theme song

881
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:11,440
and advance access to future videos like this one. If you'd like to support this channel in a way

882
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:17,920
that doesn't cost you anything you can like, comment, subscribe, and hit the bell. I appreciate

883
01:32:17,920 --> 01:32:23,200
anyone who does so has my thanks. Anyone who watches this video has my thanks. Basically just

884
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,480
thank you everyone.
