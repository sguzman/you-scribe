1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
This is the sort of video I make when I'm trapped inside all day.

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,680
As I speak, we're in the midst of a global pandemic where everyone is trying to quarantine

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,000
themselves away from the infectious world around them. While I'm not going to present myself as

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,560
someone nearly knowledgeable enough to speak as an authority on how society should be handling

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,440
this moment, I want to talk about how some even less qualified people are using it to

6
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:32,240
spread their fascist propaganda. Reactionaries of many stripes have been growing quite a bit

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,520
about borders lately, particularly since various nations are self-quarantining in the face of a

8
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,360
global pandemic. This somehow vindicates their long calls for closing borders. Of course,

9
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,720
closing borders during a pandemic isn't the same as stopping mass migration, which is what they're

10
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,960
always complaining about, but that's not stopping them from offering the only solution they ever

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,880
have in a crisis. Paul Joseph Watson gives us an example in his video, Idiots React to Coronavirus.

12
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,920
I think there's a typo in it that S should probably be behind reacts. Anyway, here's the clip.

13
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,440
The irony of singing a song about open borders after a disease has killed thousands of people

14
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,320
because of open borders. And in C-O-R-O-N-A-V-I-R-U-S sick face emoji, he has a similar take.

15
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:26,720
Russia, which closed its entire 2600 mile border back in January. Just 20 coronavirus cases,

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:32,320
most of which were Russians returning from Italy. Most of the victims have already recovered,

17
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,960
zero deaths. No pandemic in Russia. Strong border controls, minimal coronavirus cases.

18
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,120
What's most obnoxious about these clips is the smugness dripping out of Watson.

19
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,040
But why does he feel like he can be so smug? Since when has Paul ever spoken about the spread of a

20
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,720
pandemic? We get a better understanding of the smugness from the even more smug Stefan Molyneux

21
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,200
in his video, Coronavirus Update with Stefan Molyneux borders closed.

22
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:07,600
Guess the world leaders have given up on the mainstream media and now they're listening to

23
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:16,400
alternative media. And that may be the salvation of hundreds of thousands of people. And that is

24
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:25,040
a very, very powerful thing. And I'm pleased and I'm proud to have done my part in helping to save

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,720
thousands of lives, hundreds of thousands of lives, potentially millions around the world,

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,600
not a bad couple of weeks work. People in Canada, people in the West have been desperate to close

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:42,320
their borders for 20 years, more really 30 years or so. And it's here we understand what the project

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,800
really looks like. The pandemic is being used to foment the same anti-immigrant sentiment these

29
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,640
folks have always been using. They want us to pair the feeling of safety you might get with

30
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,440
temporary border closures with closing borders to immigration. Here's some telling anecdotes

31
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,920
Paul Joseph Watson uses in his social distancing hand emoji video. Mark D. Levine, chair of New

32
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,680
York City Council Health Committee, lauded how huge crowds gathering in New York City's Chinatown

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,080
was a powerful show of defiance of the coronavirus scare, tweeting four images of large groups of

34
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,960
people gathered to celebrate the occasion. Most of the attendees were Chinese and some of them

35
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:24,560
had almost certainly recently returned from China. And he conflates the movement of people with social

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,480
distancing. According to top Italian virologist Dr. Giorgio Palau, Italy's left-wing government

37
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,360
refused to isolate people coming in from China because it was seen as quote racist. That's not

38
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:42,640
social distancing. Of course it's important to note that immigration is not the same thing as

39
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,760
social distancing. Social distancing refers to the distance we keep between individual people

40
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,760
on a daily basis. Whether or not that person is an immigrant is irrelevant because it turns out

41
00:03:53,760 --> 00:04:00,400
the virus doesn't actually care what your ethnicity is. Paul Joseph Watson does not want you to notice

42
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,760
the misdirection he's using here. He wants you to think of immigrants specifically and especially

43
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,400
being carriers of the virus. One thing I'd like to entangle here is that when a nation state closes

44
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,960
its borders that this is an effective way of stopping a pandemic. Even if you're someone who

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:19,200
generally likes immigration you may still be under that impression that keeping infected people out

46
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:24,080
of your country during a global pandemic is a good thing. For instance, Watson and Molyneux both talk

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,040
about how it's been so effective for Russia so we should be taking their lead on this. The truth is

48
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,280
it's a bit more complicated than that. According to the World Health Organization, closing

49
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:38,000
international borders in the midst of a global pandemic has a limited impact and can possibly

50
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,560
do more harm to a nation by limiting trade, particularly for nations that rely on exporting

51
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,760
their goods to keep their economy afloat. Various mathematical models suggest that isolation only

52
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:52,560
delays the inevitable spread of a disease and that other strategies like self-quarantining and

53
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,840
stronger health care services are more effective. And we can look at the Russia example right now.

54
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,200
Watson and Molyneux were talking about how closing down the borders was going to save

55
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,240
Russia from this incoming pandemic, but it turns out the mathematical models used by the World

56
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,440
Health Organization were much better predictors. And we can see sadly that COVID has started to

57
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,880
rise very rapidly within Russia. Turns out viruses don't necessarily stop at borders.

58
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,360
So why do nation states close their borders? In an article for Foreign Policy, Dr. Mara

59
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,160
Pillinger suggests the reason they do this isn't because they're effective on their face,

60
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,160
but rather they signal to the population that the government is taking extreme measures to

61
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,840
control the situation. And it's understandable that in a time like this, people want to think

62
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,000
that their government has things under control. But there are more important steps that need to

63
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,200
be taken, like providing health care for citizens, coordinating with scientists around the world to

64
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:49,760
work on treatments. There are of course benefits to restricting travel, especially when it comes

65
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,960
to social distancing and the dangers of having people crowded into buses or airplanes. And the

66
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,360
role borders play when it comes to the spread of a disease during a pandemic is an interesting and

67
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,320
important discussion. But that's not what we're talking about in these videos. We're not getting

68
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,120
a fact-based argument about border control from these guys. What we're seeing is the scapegoating

69
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:15,760
of immigrants and non-white populations. Immigrants are not responsible for the spread of COVID-19.

70
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,120
This shouldn't need to be said, but considering the people we're talking about here, it shouldn't

71
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,360
be surprising that immigrants are once again presented as a scapegoat. Let me go back to this

72
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,680
clip for a second. Most of the attendees were Chinese and some of them had almost certainly

73
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,000
recently returned from China. What is Paul Joseph Watson talking about here? How does he know anyone

74
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
in this crowd was recently in China? And if they were in China, how does he know what they were

75
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,680
exposed to? Why is he just assuming that anyone Chinese is a potential virus sector? These people

76
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,080
could very well have been born in the US, or they could have been living there for years.

77
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:52,480
Maybe none of them have been back to China for decades. I don't know, and the important thing

78
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:58,720
is neither does he. To assume that Chinese people are inherently more dangerous is, well, it's a

79
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:05,440
racist assumption. And for God's sake, can we focus on what matters while fighting a deadly global

80
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,240
pandemic? Can we just shut up about racism for five fucking minutes? Maybe he could help us out

81
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,480
by being less racist. If he were criticizing the actions of the Chinese government, that would be

82
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:21,280
fine. There's plenty of criticism to be done on that side, but he would sooner put it on the

83
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,480
Chinese people themselves, portraying everyone who's Chinese or of Chinese descent as a potential

84
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:31,440
threat. Paul Joseph Watson and Stefan Molyneux are part of a project to demonize people of color.

85
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,600
For all the talk you might have heard of Asian immigrants being preferable to immigrants from

86
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,240
Africa or the Middle East, the second they think they have a plausible excuse, this minority group

87
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,360
is going under the bus just as quickly. This pandemic will be used to justify portraying people

88
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:50,160
of Asian descent as dangerous and disease-ridden, all in an effort to create what every fascist

89
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:56,000
wants, an ethnostate. And we can see some of this anti-Chinese and more broadly anti-East Asian

90
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,520
sentiment manifesting itself right now. The FBI has warned of a possible surge in hate crimes in

91
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,240
the US, and in Canada there have been increased reports of Canadians of Southeast Asian descent

92
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,120
facing discrimination. Here are some words from Cynthia Choi, the co-executive director of Chinese

93
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,480
for affirmative action. We are very, very concerned in the Asian-American community that

94
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:24,560
this will have a lasting impact. We have yet to understand the full extent of what it will mean

95
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,200
to come out on the other side. We don't think that the anti-Asian sentiment that we're seeing now is

96
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:37,120
going to go away, and we're going to need to address that as a society. And make no mistake,

97
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,840
using terms like Chinese virus and the fixation of Chinese people as a threat

98
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,640
is part of a long-term game. We've been hearing echoes of this from the exact same commentators

99
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,440
for years. Here's another Paul Joseph Watson clip. This is from December of 2019 titled

100
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,360
Diversity is our strength. Now I haven't quite been able to put my finger on it, but could there

101
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:03,440
be some kind of connection between the relative safety of these countries and the kind of people

102
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,120
who live there? But who needs safety when you can have diversity? I know which one I choose.

103
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:14,400
Who needs actual borders when you can just have internal diversity barriers?

104
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,800
It's a simple video with a simple message. There need to be fewer people of color in Europe and

105
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,080
North America. Previously this was largely about Muslim immigrants and refugees capitalizing on

106
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,960
increase in anti-Muslim sentiment after September 11th, and I think this makes clear what the

107
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,600
fascist playbook looks like, because they really only have one go-to move, and that's scapegoating

108
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,840
minority groups. One thing you'll note from extremists like Watson and Molyneux is that

109
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,920
they're quite ready to criticize politicians on the left, but are far more reluctant to call up

110
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:47,440
politicians on the right. For example when Watson says, now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this

111
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:54,000
isn't a big deal, and the people who say it's just the flu are obviously downplaying the severity of

112
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:59,600
You'd think it would be followed by a clip like this. This is a flu. This is like a flu.

113
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,240
Well if you're familiar with Paul Joseph Watson you probably wouldn't expect him to do something

114
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,880
like that. Instead he would rather lambast politicians on the left. The reason for this

115
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,760
is because these far-right figures are more likely to find support in mainstream conservatism. Here

116
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:19,920
are some examples of Tucker Carlson talking about the dangers of immigration and open borders.

117
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,880
Get rid of ICE, accept most refugees, give citizenship to tens of millions of people

118
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,480
here illegally. In other words, open borders. The idea of closing borders is already popular on

119
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,960
the right, although in that case it's using immigrants as scapegoats for economic hardship.

120
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,600
The far-right piggybacks on this exact same strategy, using immigrants as scapegoats for,

121
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,680
well, pretty much everything. Watson and Molyneux are clearly afraid of angering the right-wing

122
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,480
audience, but they're still playing them. They're exploiting this crisis, comforting their audience

123
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,720
to assure them that their beloved right-wing politicians have no responsibility for their

124
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,080
government's poor response, when really politicians of all stripes have failed to one degree or another.

125
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,240
The mission of these two is to target politicians who would be greater obstacles for their far-right

126
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,640
agenda. We can see this in some of the rhetoric used by the likes of Watson. Here's an example of

127
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,760
how he ties immigration directly to the pandemic and tries to imply his stance is a more authentic

128
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,520
vision of conservatism. They all the big city LA and New York conservatives who are panicking

129
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,920
because their favorite lobster restaurants are closing and they can't cook. These are the same

130
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,200
conservatives who quietly support mass immigration because they need cheap foreign labor ethnic

131
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,720
minorities to prepare all their food. We see this approach to other problems as well. To a fascist,

132
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,680
there's no crisis in the world that is insolvable by demonizing ethnic minorities. We can see that

133
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,320
with the slow rise of eco-fascism, where elements of the far right are adopting the rhetoric of

134
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:48,000
environmentalists to spread their fascism. Naomi Klein spoke about this back in September of 2019.

135
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,360
I think the only thing scarier than a far-right racist movement that denies the reality of climate

136
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,840
change is a far-right racist movement that doesn't deny the reality of climate change.

137
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:04,160
That actually says this is happening. There are going to be many, many millions of people on the

138
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:12,960
move. And we are going to use this abhorrent ideology that ranks the relative value of human

139
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,720
life, that puts white Christians at the top of the hierarchy, that animalizes and otherizes everyone

140
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:26,800
else, as the justification for allowing those people to die. The same global response we need

141
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,680
to combat climate change is the same one we need to respond to the pandemic. And some of the rhetoric

142
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,480
used about this pandemic is already proving to be quite dangerous and ready for exploitation by

143
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:42,880
fascists, such as comments claiming that humanity is the virus. Now call me a radical if you must,

144
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:50,320
but I am pro-human. That's right, pro-human. And maybe this is just the dreamer in me, but I think

145
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,360
humans can live on this planet in a way that doesn't destroy it. What's worse about this rhetoric is

146
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,720
that it's not very difficult for a fascist to swoop in and say, yes, humans are the problem, but let's

147
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,640
just rephrase that, not all humans surely, just the wrong kinds of humans. The ones you perhaps

148
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:11,280
don't want to be living next to. If you're one of those people who thinks humanity is the virus,

149
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:17,680
you might even lean in a little more. Hmm, tell me more. And that's the trap fascists use. So we

150
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,720
need to be very careful in the strategies we use to fight pandemics and all sorts of other struggles.

151
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:26,480
We can stop a pandemic by working together to limit its spread and ensure that the most

152
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
vulnerable have access to care. And we can stop climate change by reducing emissions and helping

153
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,040
those most harmed by its effects. These are problems that require a number of different

154
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,360
approaches and all of us cooperating together. Those of us who would sooner divide us into tribes

155
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,040
to war against one another so they can create their little fiefdoms aren't worth listening to.

156
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,560
Those are the voices dragging us backwards. Much in the way conservatives only have the one joke

157
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:57,440
about gender they use over and over to attack trans people. Look, here's Ben Shapiro doing a

158
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:05,120
version of it. Good one, Ben. Fascists only have one solution to real world problems, whether it's

159
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,480
income inequality, climate change, terrorism, or a global pandemic. They always blame immigrants,

160
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,760
they always blame ethnic minorities, and they always find the most vulnerable groups to scapegoat.

161
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:20,080
Because they actually don't care about solving these problems. Their goal is to create an

162
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:24,800
ethno state and that starts by getting rid of all the people they consider undesirable.

163
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,560
We face a number of problems today and they require a number of different solutions and

164
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,880
they require us to work together as a global community. We can't stop a pandemic one nation

165
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,840
at a time. The same way we can't stop any of these other real challenges, we face as a species

166
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,880
without working together. Jose, you might be asking, what are these solutions you speak of?

167
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,520
When it comes to pandemics, listen to medical professionals rather than pundits and politicians.

168
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,440
When it comes to your own personal health care. And as for political solutions,

169
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:58,000
demand better access to health care. When it comes to relief packages, voice your support

170
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,640
for those that help marginalize communities and workers and people uniquely affected by this

171
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:07,440
pandemic. And more importantly, while we're all inside talking to one another from around the

172
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:11,680
world, let's try and realize that we're all in this together. That these movements we want to

173
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:16,320
create are ones that need to be truly global. At the end of the day, we need to be united.

174
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:23,280
Even if we could create our beautiful utopia here in this little patch of land we call Canada,

175
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,440
it would mean nothing to me if the rest of the world was suffering and miserable.

176
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,440
So this video was a bit of a surprise. I cooked it together pretty quickly. It's something I've

177
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,280
been looking at for the last couple of weeks and I kind of want to just say something quick about it.

178
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:42,320
I'm trying to make shorter videos because I think the long epics as fun as they are aren't the only

179
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,560
thing people want to see on YouTube. People like this one. I'll might make shorter commentary ones

180
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,280
like this in the future. For those of you wondering, where is the sitcom video you spoke of? Wasn't

181
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:57,200
that what you've been working on for the last few months? Yes. Yes, it is. And was. It's still

182
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:04,000
coming. Turns out a complication has arisen. It's gonna take a little bit longer to come out than I

183
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:10,320
expected. I hope to have it up for everyone to watch soon. When that will be, I just don't know

184
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,440
right now. But if you want to know as soon as it's up, I highly recommend following me on Twitter

185
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,320
where I will have updates. Or you can also become a patron because they'll be seen at first. You'll

186
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,040
also get their names and the credits just like you see here and all those and there's like another

187
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,400
like theme song download thing. Yeah, that's there too. If you join my Patreon, I want to add though,

188
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:38,080
it's a really difficult time right now for a lot of people. If you are someone who's facing some

189
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,920
economic hardship, I want you to know I completely understand and I encourage you not to become a

190
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,880
patron if you're in that situation. Please take care of yourself. I'm gonna be fine. I would hate

191
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,120
to think someone was giving me any money and then struggling to put food on their table. That's

192
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:00,320
money I just don't want in my pocket. If you do want to support this channel, there is a thing you

193
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,320
can do for free. It's called hitting that like button, subscribing if you aren't already,

194
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:10,400
ringing that bell and leaving a lovely comment below. And before I leave, I'll give you one

195
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,840
last thing and that is my thank you for watching. Bye.
