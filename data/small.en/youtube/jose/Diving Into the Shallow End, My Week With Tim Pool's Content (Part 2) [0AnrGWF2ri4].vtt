00:00.000 --> 00:02.220
Part 2 of 2.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.900
And looking back on this week, I can safely say I'm so glad it's over.

00:06.900 --> 00:20.900
The world is weird, it makes me nervous, I get to talk about it, but how I say.

00:20.900 --> 00:24.620
Only touches on the subject in a few videos, I did want to highlight this specifically

00:24.620 --> 00:28.500
because it encapsulates what right-wing propaganda does so effectively.

00:28.500 --> 00:32.160
Even if Tim doesn't think of himself as right-wing, the fact that he parrots their

00:32.160 --> 00:35.840
talking points uncritically makes his personal opinions irrelevant.

00:35.840 --> 00:39.520
When it comes to trans issues, he helps spread a conservative narrative.

00:39.520 --> 00:46.400
In Far Leftists Are Tearing, JK Rowling to Shreds after a transphobic tweet.

00:46.400 --> 00:51.360
Tim came out, as you might have guessed, in favor of JK Rowling and her transphobic tweet.

00:51.360 --> 00:56.600
If JK Rowling is going to speak up for a woman who is unjustly fired, she did the right thing.

00:56.600 --> 01:00.500
And this is exactly what you can expect from the fringe, authoritarian left who want to

01:00.500 --> 01:05.860
now destroy her over this.

01:05.860 --> 01:07.760
Male and female exist.

01:07.760 --> 01:08.940
She is correct.

01:08.940 --> 01:12.340
She said gender expression identity is different and people can express themselves however

01:12.340 --> 01:13.420
they want.

01:13.420 --> 01:16.380
She took the fair and reasonable approach.

01:16.380 --> 01:21.180
She actually ceded the gender framing to the left.

01:21.180 --> 01:26.180
But because she said male and female are real, and a male can never become a female, that's

01:26.180 --> 01:27.180
it.

01:27.180 --> 01:42.000
Before covering the trans issue, I'd like to note Tim's framing of JK Rowling in general.

01:42.000 --> 01:46.320
When Rowling does something that might appeal to the left, like revealing one of her characters

01:46.320 --> 01:49.140
was actually gay, it's considered pandering.

01:49.140 --> 01:53.560
But when appealing to the right, by defending a turf, she's apparently standing up for

01:53.560 --> 01:55.100
something she believes in.

01:55.100 --> 01:58.920
This is another example of how Tim frames left and right-wing opinions.

01:58.920 --> 02:03.760
One is cynical and disingenuous, and the other one is genuine and heartfelt.

02:03.760 --> 02:07.840
The story of the woman Rowling was tweeting her support of could make for a whole video

02:07.840 --> 02:11.940
in and of itself, but I want to focus on Tim's opinions about trans people and how these

02:11.940 --> 02:13.740
opinions frame his commentary.

02:13.740 --> 02:18.880
Up until the point we develop technology that can radically alter your DNA and reconstruct

02:18.880 --> 02:24.280
your body at the cellular level, males cannot become female or vice versa.

02:24.280 --> 02:28.920
Now you can become a trans, you know, you can transition, and you can present as male

02:28.920 --> 02:32.160
or female, but that's different from literally being as such.

02:32.160 --> 02:33.520
He backs this up by saying,

02:33.520 --> 02:34.580
They're facts!

02:34.580 --> 02:36.480
It's biological fact!

02:36.480 --> 02:37.720
Where's reality going?

02:37.720 --> 02:39.660
This is the standard right-wing talking point.

02:39.660 --> 02:43.480
When someone is assigned male or female at birth, this is something stamped on them to

02:43.480 --> 02:48.340
never be altered or changed, and something that is apparently instantly evident at the

02:48.340 --> 02:49.840
moment of birth.

02:49.840 --> 02:54.920
Let's jump ahead to Hollywood leftists just proved they are spineless cowards bending

02:54.920 --> 02:57.480
the knee to far-left Twitter Roddy.

02:57.480 --> 02:59.720
He's very concerned about science in this one.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.660
I have some bad news for people.

03:01.660 --> 03:02.740
Science is a thing.

03:02.740 --> 03:07.240
And you can't just say something is anti-science without actually having academia to back it

03:07.240 --> 03:08.240
up.

03:08.240 --> 03:12.080
In this video, Tim goes off against GLAAD and HRC, who, you would think, might know

03:12.080 --> 03:13.580
something about trans people.

03:13.580 --> 03:16.200
But Tim is about to blow them out of the water.

03:16.200 --> 03:18.800
He opens with this powerful statement.

03:18.800 --> 03:19.800
My opinion.

03:19.800 --> 03:21.440
I am not saying these things to be hurtful.

03:21.440 --> 03:26.880
I am saying that currently, based on human knowledge and the structure of the English

03:26.880 --> 03:31.240
language, what they said is just fundamentally false.

03:31.240 --> 03:36.640
If you Google the word woman, they tell you a woman is an adult human female.

03:36.640 --> 03:40.320
And now we are getting to the point where definitions literally don't make sense.

03:40.320 --> 03:41.700
But he doesn't stop there.

03:41.700 --> 03:44.440
He goes with the strongest science he knows.

03:44.440 --> 03:45.760
Here's the Wikipedia page for women.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.200
I have shown this many a time.

03:48.200 --> 03:51.640
It says, a woman is a female human being.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.520
The word woman is usually reserved for an adult.

03:53.520 --> 03:56.800
Girl is usually the term for a female child or adolescent.

03:56.800 --> 04:02.040
The plural women is also sometimes used for female humans, regardless of age, as in phrases

04:02.040 --> 04:03.360
such as women's rights.

04:03.360 --> 04:07.320
My favorite part is when he gets to the section on the page that explains trans women are

04:07.320 --> 04:09.960
also women, and he just gets angry about it.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.160
However, it also says some women are trans.

04:13.160 --> 04:16.180
That literally makes no sense.

04:16.180 --> 04:18.580
If you want it to be true, that's fine.

04:18.580 --> 04:22.460
It's not an argument about opinions or ideology, I'm literally telling you.

04:22.460 --> 04:25.060
You can't simultaneously say at the same time.

04:25.060 --> 04:28.500
A woman is a female human being, and some women are trans.

04:28.500 --> 04:34.060
The some women are trans would then actually mean that some women are trans men.

04:34.060 --> 04:37.620
So Wikipedia is an authority until Tim decides it isn't.

04:37.620 --> 04:39.720
Tim is at his most honest here, though.

04:39.720 --> 04:44.820
That means I need you to define what this means so that I can agree with you.

04:44.820 --> 04:47.620
Because right now, basically, I have no idea what you're trying to say.

04:47.620 --> 04:48.940
I really, really don't.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.660
But he offers a path forward.

04:50.660 --> 04:55.020
If it turns out, because yes, I've read much of this academic literature.

04:55.020 --> 04:57.580
So I've seen the arguments.

04:57.580 --> 05:00.900
I am just saying right now, we are not in that place.

05:00.900 --> 05:04.900
This is the standard conservative pushback against the idea of trans people.

05:04.900 --> 05:09.600
When in doubt, cite science without pointing towards any specific researcher or findings

05:09.600 --> 05:10.600
or anything, really.

05:10.600 --> 05:15.340
The word science, and in this case a Wikipedia page that disagrees with you, is all that

05:15.340 --> 05:16.340
anyone needs.

05:16.340 --> 05:20.660
Tim's spin on this is to repeatedly claim how much he respects trans people and will

05:20.660 --> 05:24.680
use their pronouns out of politeness, but ultimately he doesn't see any scientific

05:24.680 --> 05:28.440
basis in them saying they are the gender they identify with.

05:28.440 --> 05:33.120
For those of us not as well versed on this as Professor Poole thinks he is, I'd point

05:33.120 --> 05:39.940
people towards a lovely article in Scientific American by neuroscientist and doctoral candidate

05:39.940 --> 05:45.040
Simone D. Sun that makes a good case for the biological underpinnings of being trans

05:45.040 --> 05:49.640
and the complexity of the male and female labels we use so freely.

05:49.640 --> 05:54.560
Turns out it's far more complicated than people assume and not firmly fixed as someone

05:54.560 --> 05:56.680
such as Tim would have you believe.

05:56.680 --> 06:01.580
By covering for people like J.K. Rowling when they say something anti-trans, Tim is helping

06:01.580 --> 06:06.480
uphold a conservative narrative that trans people's lived experiences are delusions.

06:09.940 --> 06:18.380
Tim's analysis of pretty much all news stories reveal a complete lack of curiosity.

06:18.380 --> 06:22.400
He will complain about the mainstream media jumping to conclusions or not doing their

06:22.400 --> 06:26.440
due diligence, but there are several examples of how his bias guides him through news stories

06:26.440 --> 06:29.440
to frame them within a general anti-left sentiment.

06:29.440 --> 06:34.360
In the video, 5 students ARRESTED for beating a 14 year old allegedly for wearing a MAGA

06:34.360 --> 06:35.360
hat.

06:35.360 --> 06:38.200
I probably didn't need to say MAGA like that, but I will leave it in.

06:38.200 --> 06:42.880
He credulously repeats the common narrative of right-wingers being under attack for supporting

06:42.880 --> 06:44.200
Trump in public.

06:44.200 --> 06:48.360
One important caveat to this video's title is that at the time of the attack, the kid

06:48.360 --> 06:50.420
was not wearing a MAGA hat.

06:50.420 --> 06:54.020
At the time of the incident, he wasn't wearing the hat.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.380
Question it, whatever.

06:55.380 --> 06:59.560
The argument is that he had worn it in the past, was bullied for it, so stopped and then

06:59.560 --> 07:01.020
got bullied again.

07:01.020 --> 07:05.020
The only piece of evidence we have, a video of this attack, shows the kid not wearing

07:05.020 --> 07:06.020
a MAGA hat.

07:06.020 --> 07:09.680
So why does Tim believe that this is somehow linked to it?

07:09.680 --> 07:13.500
Because this is so, well it's common enough, I kinda believe it.

07:13.500 --> 07:16.780
So Tim just believes it, because, well, it's happened before.

07:16.780 --> 07:18.740
This isn't how journalism works.

07:18.740 --> 07:22.620
You can't just take a claim on face value because you believe it happened before.

07:22.620 --> 07:27.120
The onus is still on the person making the claim to provide evidence.

07:27.120 --> 07:31.380
The story was publicized by the boy's mother, who happens to run a fairly prominent Twitter

07:31.380 --> 07:33.880
account with nearly half a million followers.

07:33.880 --> 07:38.400
This is the only source saying the boy was being bullied for wearing a MAGA hat.

07:38.400 --> 07:43.320
She also claims it was a hate crime because her son is white and his attackers were black.

07:43.320 --> 07:47.480
There's an official statement from the school, which Tim mentions, that says the fight had

07:47.480 --> 07:49.440
nothing to do with clothing.

07:49.440 --> 07:52.500
There was no evidence found during the investigation that indicated the student was wearing any

07:52.500 --> 07:57.760
of this apparel at the time of the altercation, or that his wearing of such apparel on a prior

07:57.760 --> 07:59.280
occasion motivated the incident.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.280
Boom.

08:00.280 --> 08:01.280
There it is.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.280
That's the important point.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.160
You gotta be careful, man, because there are people who take advantage of your good

08:05.160 --> 08:06.600
will on the left and the right.

08:06.600 --> 08:10.000
Tim responds to this by suggesting the school might be lying.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.720
I understand the school has reason to try and deflect and be like, no, no, no, it doesn't

08:14.720 --> 08:16.040
happen at our school.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.800
But I also want to make sure you're all aware, tons of people lie.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.440
They are grifters and they will come for you.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.360
I'm not accusing them of anything.

08:24.360 --> 08:28.480
He never assumes this of the boy's mother, or at least he doesn't assume the mother

08:28.480 --> 08:32.920
might not have all the facts, that a GoFundMe was started by the boy's mother so that

08:32.920 --> 08:38.000
she can homeschool him is similarly mentioned without the faintest bit of suspicion.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.640
But the most telling line is here.

08:40.640 --> 08:41.720
How do you prove a negative?

08:41.720 --> 08:42.720
You know what I mean?

08:42.720 --> 08:46.680
Like, if the school is saying it was not motivated by a previous political hat, how do you know

08:46.680 --> 08:47.680
that?

08:47.680 --> 08:50.080
That's just not how proving anything works.

08:50.080 --> 08:55.480
If there's a claim and no evidence is provided for it, as a journalist, you should try finding

08:55.480 --> 08:56.480
it.

08:56.480 --> 08:59.160
If you can't find that evidence, then guess what?

08:59.160 --> 09:01.200
You don't run the story.

09:01.200 --> 09:04.720
I lean more towards the likelihood of this being true, regardless of what the school

09:04.720 --> 09:10.600
said, simply because it fits with what we've seen in the past.

09:10.600 --> 09:14.140
This is the perfect example of the laziness of Tim Poole.

09:14.140 --> 09:18.380
He would sooner believe the framing he sees on Twitter rather than the school's investigation

09:18.380 --> 09:23.200
because it fits in with the persecuted conservative narrative he already believes is true.

09:23.200 --> 09:27.600
This is what happens when you let narratives determine how you view the news of the day.

09:27.600 --> 09:31.960
This seems grossly irresponsible to me, and reading the comments we can see what his audience

09:31.960 --> 09:34.200
took away from this.

09:34.200 --> 09:37.920
Imagine if five of white's kids did this to a black kid.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.680
Worldwide news for weeks.

09:39.680 --> 09:43.320
Can you imagine eight white kids doing this?

09:43.320 --> 09:49.040
CNN, the KKK is back, and lynchings of POC have begun again.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.480
God help us.

09:50.480 --> 09:56.800
They beat him because he was white, and their best excuse was he was wearing Trump's merch.

09:56.800 --> 10:00.680
It makes one wonder why Tim Poole's audience gets so worked up about white people.

10:00.680 --> 10:04.200
But what's most alarming to me about this story is that the kids seen fighting in the

10:04.200 --> 10:09.000
first video are getting charged, which seems pretty extreme for kids so young.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.360
But no one seems to care that they now have criminal records before they've even gotten

10:12.360 --> 10:14.120
their driver's license.

10:14.120 --> 10:18.580
Fights on school buses happen every day, but thanks to the coverage from conservative media,

10:18.580 --> 10:21.980
this one almost certainly got more scrutiny than it otherwise would have.

10:21.980 --> 10:25.660
And Tim is part of the problem when he propagates baseless stories like this one.

10:25.660 --> 10:29.980
Although he claims to be a liberal, someone who parrots conservative media stories, especially

10:29.980 --> 10:34.220
ones like these, with racist undertones of white people being under attack, aren't just

10:34.220 --> 10:35.580
fostering hatred.

10:35.580 --> 10:38.660
There are direct, real-world consequences to this.

10:38.660 --> 10:42.380
Another conservative narrative Tim loves to repeat is that there's an impending civil

10:42.380 --> 10:43.380
war.

10:43.380 --> 10:48.420
What would that topic in 95 Second Amendment sanctuaries emerge in Virginia if there's

10:48.420 --> 10:51.440
a second civil war it starts here?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.440
In this video, Tim boldly claims,

10:53.440 --> 10:56.700
Well, now we can see what's happening in Virginia.

10:56.700 --> 11:01.580
As the Democrats won a majority and now they're trying to enact a ton of laws, essentially

11:01.580 --> 11:02.580
gun confiscation.

11:02.580 --> 11:03.580
It's kind of complicated.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.900
Of course it's complicated.

11:04.900 --> 11:06.980
I know I say it a lot, but it is.

11:06.980 --> 11:09.380
I genuinely don't know what he's talking about here.

11:09.380 --> 11:13.340
It would help if he explained which laws Democrats are passing within Virginia that are threatened

11:13.340 --> 11:15.240
to take away people's guns.

11:15.240 --> 11:16.540
But he doesn't.

11:16.540 --> 11:20.020
I know this is a common talking point on the right, but where's the evidence that this

11:20.020 --> 11:21.340
is actually happening?

11:21.340 --> 11:26.220
The only details Tim offers refer to the Republicans being responsible for these Virginia counties

11:26.220 --> 11:28.900
passing laws to protect gun ownership.

11:28.900 --> 11:32.180
Tim believes guns are essential to living in the middle of nowhere.

11:32.180 --> 11:34.020
He provides us a chilling example.

11:34.020 --> 11:38.140
If you're in the middle of nowhere and you see, I don't know, a coyote?

11:38.140 --> 11:39.660
Or a villain?

11:39.660 --> 11:40.660
Because guess what?

11:40.660 --> 11:41.660
People can be bad too.

11:41.660 --> 11:42.660
What do you do?

11:42.980 --> 11:44.300
You're out in the middle of nowhere.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.860
You're in your little car.

11:45.860 --> 11:47.460
You pull off on the side of the road.

11:47.460 --> 11:48.980
You know, you're going to change your tire.

11:48.980 --> 11:49.980
Who knows what?

11:49.980 --> 11:54.660
And all of a sudden you see this shambling dude lurking all about and he pulls out a

11:54.660 --> 11:55.660
knife.

11:55.660 --> 11:56.660
Yeah.

11:56.660 --> 11:57.660
You're going to call the police?

11:57.660 --> 11:58.660
Congratulations.

11:58.660 --> 11:59.660
They'll be there.

11:59.660 --> 12:00.660
They're 200 miles away.

12:00.660 --> 12:01.660
No.

12:01.660 --> 12:04.940
So in this scenario, there are shambling, knife wielding villains on the prowl in the

12:04.940 --> 12:06.020
middle of nowhere.

12:06.020 --> 12:09.340
Does Tim think rural America is like Silent Hill?

12:09.340 --> 12:12.900
But let's get back to the real narrative Tim is pushing here that the left is coming

12:12.900 --> 12:14.700
for everyone's guns.

12:14.700 --> 12:16.100
And how are they going to do it?

12:16.100 --> 12:17.740
With immigration.

12:17.740 --> 12:20.700
Immigrants are religious and they're going to bring with them more conservative values

12:20.700 --> 12:22.220
than progressives will have.

12:22.220 --> 12:23.220
Progressives are secular.

12:23.220 --> 12:24.220
Okay.

12:24.220 --> 12:25.220
Latino migrants from Mexico.

12:25.220 --> 12:26.220
They're not.

12:26.220 --> 12:27.220
They're Christians.

12:27.220 --> 12:28.220
Okay.

12:28.220 --> 12:30.900
That's a good win for conservatives, but they also don't have the same constitutional values

12:30.900 --> 12:31.900
that Americans have.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.420
So yes, they will vote Democrat and they will vote to take away your rights in the

12:35.420 --> 12:36.940
long run.

12:36.940 --> 12:40.780
But things are going to shift very religious and there will be a lot of conservative aspects

12:40.780 --> 12:43.620
that come back like Christmas, for instance.

12:43.620 --> 12:48.260
So immigrants will arrive with their religious values and apparently not assimilate, turning

12:48.260 --> 12:51.740
the democratic party into the party of Christian conservatism.

12:51.740 --> 12:52.740
This is quite the prediction.

12:52.740 --> 12:56.500
If you know anything about the evangelical base of the Republican party.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.420
Just a side note, when did Christmas go away?

12:58.420 --> 13:00.420
I think he's trying to explain that here.

13:00.420 --> 13:04.020
All the people screeching that some guy said Merry Christmas.

13:04.020 --> 13:05.020
Oh no.

13:05.020 --> 13:06.020
Who cares?

13:06.100 --> 13:11.620
Yeah, you realize in like 30 years, happy holidays will be gone because the people you're

13:11.620 --> 13:16.180
inviting into the country are overwhelmingly Christians, you know, I don't think they

13:16.180 --> 13:17.180
get it.

13:17.180 --> 13:21.060
I'm pretty sure Christmas was just celebrated in the US.

13:21.060 --> 13:22.820
Can someone confirm that for me?

13:22.820 --> 13:26.580
But that aside, there's a more sinister point Tim is making here.

13:26.580 --> 13:30.100
So they're Christians, but they're not constitutional Americans.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.900
They don't look at free speech and these issues the same way.

13:32.900 --> 13:34.500
That's the real threat to our rights.

13:34.500 --> 13:38.820
This is a common conservative narrative, this idea that immigrants will not assimilate

13:38.820 --> 13:42.500
and demand the country upend the Constitution to limit people's rights.

13:42.500 --> 13:46.740
Tim doesn't even understand why he just buys into the idea that immigrants have distinct

13:46.740 --> 13:51.580
cultures and won't become real Americans that believe in American ideals.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.260
For what it's worth, Tim clarifies and says literally everybody can come to the United

13:55.260 --> 13:56.260
States.

13:56.260 --> 13:59.900
All of them, every single person, okay, if it's legally done.

13:59.900 --> 14:03.100
And he explains it's illegal immigration.

14:03.100 --> 14:04.100
That's the issue.

14:04.340 --> 14:08.900
To be as charitable as possible, maybe Tim thinks the real danger is making illegal immigrants

14:08.900 --> 14:14.260
citizens will shift the balance of immigrants and native born Americans so that immigrants

14:14.260 --> 14:18.180
would be empowered to vote away everyone's rights.

14:18.180 --> 14:22.020
I don't understand how this can be anything other than prejudice to assume that anyone

14:22.020 --> 14:27.020
coming to America will do so in an effort to reshape the country, to take away everyone's

14:27.020 --> 14:28.020
rights.

14:28.020 --> 14:29.020
It's not the end of the world.

14:29.020 --> 14:30.020
Y'all need to calm down.

14:30.020 --> 14:34.060
And I like how this video ends with Tim telling people to calm down right after he spent 12

14:34.060 --> 14:37.140
minutes talking about how there was an impending civil war.

14:37.140 --> 14:38.660
Thanks for the advice, Tim.

14:38.660 --> 14:42.740
Since I chose a week close to the holidays, I got a nice dose of festive content from

14:42.740 --> 14:43.740
Tim.

14:43.740 --> 14:48.140
Here's one video that's strangely titled, Soon Merry Christmas Will Be Hate Speech.

14:48.140 --> 14:50.460
Comedian got in trouble at work for saying it.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.420
Tim's discussing two stories here.

14:52.420 --> 14:57.540
One is of comedian Whitney Cummings supposedly being reported to HR for wishing someone a

14:57.540 --> 15:07.300
Merry Christmas, and the other example is Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch being

15:07.300 --> 15:19.620
criticized for saying Merry Christmas on Fox News.

15:19.620 --> 15:23.700
You can see the glee Tim gets when he hears a story about people being stupid.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.240
I wonder if he watches his own videos.

15:26.240 --> 15:31.400
And speaking on the Whitney Cummings incident, taking this chat show anecdote on face value,

15:31.400 --> 15:34.440
it sounds like an intern was perhaps too sensitive.

15:34.440 --> 15:37.080
And that's assuming there's no missing context here.

15:37.080 --> 15:45.440
Tim frames it like this.

15:45.440 --> 15:50.320
The punishment for Cummings, near as I can tell, was someone from HR mentioning it to

15:50.320 --> 15:51.320
her.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.320
And that's it.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.320
How nightmarish.

15:53.920 --> 15:58.000
The second story is more interesting, and it would have made more sense if Gorsuch had

15:58.000 --> 16:00.560
made his statement in a less obvious way.

16:00.560 --> 16:13.040
But let's look at the actual clip of him saying Merry Christmas.

16:13.040 --> 16:17.600
So the context here is that Fox News pretends that you can't say Merry Christmas on TV,

16:17.600 --> 16:22.760
and when Ainsley Earhart says she loves that he says it, it reinforces the idea that there's

16:22.760 --> 16:27.960
a war on Christmas, a conspiracy theory Fox News has been pushing for 15 years.

16:27.960 --> 16:32.080
Overall it's a minor point, and somehow became the focal point of this interview when

16:32.080 --> 16:36.120
I think the real question is why a Supreme Court justice is making a rare TV appearance

16:36.120 --> 16:38.740
on a partisan show like Fox and Friends.

16:38.740 --> 16:43.760
The outrage over the left going crazy appeared in article after article, each one mentioning

16:43.760 --> 16:48.000
an article that was published in Salon and a handful of tweets complaining about the

16:48.000 --> 16:49.660
Merry Christmas dog whistle.

16:49.660 --> 16:54.060
This is the perfect example of a manufactured story, and how the right wing is so effective

16:54.060 --> 16:57.980
in repeating their talking points, they believe they can spin it into a bigger deal than it

16:57.980 --> 17:02.460
really was, and Tim is playing his part in tarnishing the left with a ginned up story

17:02.460 --> 17:03.460
of outrage.

17:03.460 --> 17:07.820
And don't look, the Republicans are also fundraising off this appearance, that's not

17:07.820 --> 17:09.100
suspect at all.

17:09.100 --> 17:13.740
This video also features Tim racing to the defense of Fox's All-American Christmas ad,

17:13.740 --> 17:16.340
which was criticized for being too white.

17:16.340 --> 17:21.620
They're angry that a commercial for Ainsley Earhart doesn't include people of color,

17:21.620 --> 17:24.980
what the commercial probably has like what, three people in it?

17:24.980 --> 17:26.700
These people are insane.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.180
Just for fun, how many people were in this commercial?

17:29.180 --> 17:34.460
December, join us for an All-American Christmas, all month long on Fox Nation, bringing you

17:34.460 --> 17:39.660
heartwarming stories and original specials that celebrate America and our traditions

17:39.660 --> 17:40.660
every day.

17:40.660 --> 17:43.100
Check out these exclusive shows.

17:43.100 --> 17:47.220
This December on Fox Nation, your favorite Fox personalities celebrate an All-American

17:47.220 --> 17:48.220
Christmas.

17:48.220 --> 17:51.340
Plus, we're breaking into the Christmas vault for some classic holiday entertainment.

17:51.340 --> 17:54.100
It's an All-American Christmas on Fox Nation.

17:54.100 --> 17:55.980
So Tim was almost close.

17:55.980 --> 18:00.020
It wasn't three people, it was closer to 24.

18:00.020 --> 18:04.100
The War on Christmas idea has long been a staple at Fox News, and the Salon article

18:04.100 --> 18:08.540
I mentioned taking all the heat at least goes to the trouble of describing its origin with

18:08.700 --> 18:13.140
Bill O'Reilly back in 2004, and it includes a link to a political article that goes into

18:13.140 --> 18:14.660
further historical detail.

18:14.660 --> 18:19.140
Tim, of course, doesn't engage with any of this, and instead pretends like people pointing

18:19.140 --> 18:24.220
out the conspiracy theory are, in fact, the conspiracy theorists themselves.

18:24.220 --> 18:28.300
That a Fox host and a Supreme Court justice simply saying, Merry Christmas, I love that

18:28.300 --> 18:34.060
you say that, is actually them trying to validate a conspiracy theory, you're actually the

18:34.060 --> 18:36.660
one pushing the conspiracy theory.

18:36.660 --> 18:39.540
So I will ask, how long do you think until they start actually banning people for saying

18:39.540 --> 18:40.540
things like this?

18:40.540 --> 18:44.820
Ironically, Tim talking about people getting banned for saying Merry Christmas, a statement

18:44.820 --> 18:49.220
not backed up by any of the facts and any of the stories here, is actually perpetuating

18:49.220 --> 18:51.020
the War on Christmas conspiracy theory.

18:51.020 --> 18:56.780
A few tweets and one article Salon criticizing something isn't the same as asking for words

18:56.780 --> 18:58.260
to be banned.

18:58.260 --> 19:01.700
Tim also deploys one of his most commonly used tactics when it comes to ignoring the

19:01.700 --> 19:02.700
left.

19:02.700 --> 19:04.540
He simply writes them off as crazy.

19:04.540 --> 19:08.860
This is the epitome of just, you know what, I've never seen a more insane leftist article.

19:08.860 --> 19:09.860
I'm sorry.

19:09.860 --> 19:10.860
I'm sorry.

19:10.860 --> 19:11.860
Okay.

19:11.860 --> 19:15.980
This is one of the most common talking points he deploys and a classic method used to sidestep

19:15.980 --> 19:19.940
any real discussion or debate when you can write off your opposition is crazy.

19:19.940 --> 19:22.140
You don't have to engage with them in a meaningful sense.

19:22.140 --> 19:26.140
And I know while Tim has tried addressing people on the left in debates, like his recent

19:26.140 --> 19:30.500
embarrassing conversation with Sam Cedar, he's revealed that he isn't equipped to be

19:30.500 --> 19:32.260
having these discussions.

19:32.260 --> 19:37.260
And I admit it's it's I'll call it dickish utilitarianism is typically the villain in

19:37.260 --> 19:39.660
most movies.

19:39.660 --> 19:40.660
I don't care.

19:40.660 --> 19:41.660
Yeah.

19:41.660 --> 19:46.900
So, so for instance, like Thanos was the utilitarian and Captain America was deontological.

19:46.900 --> 19:47.900
I did.

19:47.900 --> 19:51.860
So Thanos willing to reduce the suffering by killing, you know, hundreds of trillions

19:51.860 --> 19:56.220
versus the thousands of trillions, which would be living better off.

19:56.900 --> 20:03.620
So maybe that's why he would sooner write off the left as crazy or detached from reality.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.380
He's not capable of really engaging with them in a meaningful way.

20:07.380 --> 20:12.740
I suspect a lot of that comes from him generally not understanding what he reads as evidenced

20:12.740 --> 20:15.780
by the many previous examples already in this video.

20:15.780 --> 20:20.060
Here's another example of how he doesn't really read the articles he highlights.

20:20.060 --> 20:23.940
In the war on Christmas video, I mentioned he waved away all claims about Fox News pushing

20:23.940 --> 20:27.980
a war on Christmas narrative with they say Fox News is a long history of claiming there

20:27.980 --> 20:32.500
is a war on Christmas tracing back to a 2004 segment by former talk show host Bill O'Reilly

20:32.500 --> 20:34.760
called Christmas under siege.

20:34.760 --> 20:36.700
This is insanity.

20:36.700 --> 20:40.860
He literally just said Merry Christmas and said, I love you say that.

20:40.860 --> 20:43.340
I don't know what that's supposed to mean other than Merry Christmas.

20:43.340 --> 20:46.140
And here's what happens when he gets further along in the article.

20:46.140 --> 20:47.540
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

20:47.540 --> 20:48.540
It's also anti-Semitic.

20:48.540 --> 20:50.820
They added that too.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.100
You know what, man, I'm over it.

20:53.100 --> 20:57.140
It seems like Tim was genuinely surprised to read that bit almost as if he hadn't

20:57.140 --> 21:02.020
read the article fully before deciding to make a video on it or being more fair than

21:02.020 --> 21:03.060
maybe I should be.

21:03.060 --> 21:04.940
Maybe Tim forgot about that part.

21:04.940 --> 21:06.800
He certainly didn't have anything to say about it.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.780
And that's how Tim handles most of his topics.

21:08.780 --> 21:13.420
He points out ridiculous lefts being writes them off as crazy and absolves himself of

21:13.420 --> 21:16.580
the weighty business of addressing their criticisms.

21:16.580 --> 21:21.860
And those are the exact anti-left wing narratives that his right wing audience snaps up so

21:21.860 --> 21:28.420
readily.

21:28.420 --> 21:32.600
With those major themes all covered, I did see a few videos that don't fit into any

21:32.600 --> 21:36.980
specific category that still display some of the poor tactics Tim uses to talk about

21:36.980 --> 21:37.980
the news.

21:37.980 --> 21:42.820
In a video charmingly titled Greta Thunberg Accidentally Calls for Execution of Politicians

21:42.820 --> 21:48.780
Take the Greta Thunberg Challenge, climate activist Greta Thunberg is of course a hot

21:48.780 --> 21:53.980
button topic being an advocate for climate change and Tim, though a believer in climate

21:53.980 --> 21:56.900
change supposedly, isn't a fan of Greta.

21:56.900 --> 22:00.980
The heart of this video is Greta's claim that she wants to put politicians against

22:00.980 --> 22:05.980
the wall with regard to climate change, which Tim and conservative media took to mean she

22:05.980 --> 22:10.420
wants to lead a violent revolution putting these politicians against the wall where they'll

22:10.420 --> 22:11.420
be executed.

22:11.420 --> 22:14.800
Do you know what it means to put someone against the wall in English?

22:14.800 --> 22:19.520
It's a reference to, you know, putting someone against the wall and then aiming a weapon

22:19.520 --> 22:24.360
at them because you're sentencing them to no longer being alive.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.740
But Tim breaks ranks here, surprisingly.

22:26.740 --> 22:30.820
He does the unthinkable and gets more input from a Swedish journalist who explained that

22:30.820 --> 22:35.800
in Sweden, the phrase, up against the wall, also means being in a tight spot.

22:35.800 --> 22:40.720
I reached out to a local journalist and I asked them, what does it mean?

22:40.720 --> 22:45.080
And he told me it's a very common phrase that means pushing them up against the wall

22:45.080 --> 22:49.400
and likes, it's like basically my understanding is when they don't do what you want to do,

22:49.400 --> 22:52.640
you hold them accountable about pushing them to the wall and like, you know, solding them.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.000
Like, you know, that's basically it.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.000
Here's a fun fact.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.800
That's also what it means in English, at least according to the dictionary.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.800
But the heart of why Tim doesn't like Greta is that while he agrees with her message,

23:02.800 --> 23:05.520
he thinks she's just being too mean.

23:05.520 --> 23:09.480
You need to stop propping her up.

23:10.480 --> 23:33.720
So leaving aside how gross it is for an adult man telling a teenage girl she should smile

23:33.720 --> 23:37.960
more, this is the exact sort of tone policing that's the real enemy of discourse.

23:37.960 --> 23:42.800
The idea that if only Greta were nice and polite, climate change would be solved, or

23:42.800 --> 23:45.520
at least people would finally listen.

23:45.520 --> 23:49.240
Scientists have been politely requesting governments take a moment to do something about emissions

23:49.240 --> 23:50.240
for decades.

23:50.240 --> 23:53.840
The time for politely asking for change has passed.

23:53.840 --> 23:57.600
Throughout the video, Tim keeps pivoting back to Greta needing to convince random people

23:57.600 --> 23:59.120
walking down the street.

23:59.120 --> 24:01.800
This isn't about asking someone to ride a bike to work.

24:01.800 --> 24:06.180
The only way to solve climate change is through action at the highest levels of government.

24:06.180 --> 24:10.580
Religious people are precisely who Greta was scolding, and if Tim believes that governments

24:10.580 --> 24:15.660
won't take action because the 16-year-old girl wasn't nice enough, he isn't qualified

24:15.660 --> 24:17.280
to be speaking on the subject.

24:17.280 --> 24:23.420
And before leaving, I do feel like I need to mention that Tim had two videos about UFOs.

24:23.420 --> 24:31.100
Massive surge of credible UFO sightings in 2019 theorists think aliens will reveal themselves,

24:31.100 --> 24:33.620
and Trump's Space Force is now official.

24:33.620 --> 24:38.260
New branch comes conspicuously around the same time as UFOs.

24:38.260 --> 24:43.540
I gotta say, I had no idea that Tim Poole was into UFOs, but it's the least surprising

24:43.540 --> 24:46.100
new thing I learned while watching a week of his content.

24:46.100 --> 24:50.260
Tim buys into some pretty kooky stuff, so sure, why not UFOs?

24:50.260 --> 24:55.100
Heck, he even thinks the massive waste of taxpayer money that is the Space Force is

24:55.100 --> 24:57.460
Donald Trump's coolest idea.

24:57.460 --> 25:00.820
For some reason, there are a lot of people ragging on Trump for wanting a Space Force,

25:00.820 --> 25:03.980
and I gotta admit, this is the coolest thing Trump has ever done.

25:03.980 --> 25:07.740
And he thinks this is a step towards the Federation, as seen on Star Trek.

25:07.740 --> 25:11.140
You know, we have all these shows, you know, you have Starfleet and Star Trek, and you

25:11.140 --> 25:15.140
have these sci-fi movies where there's like a fleet in outer space.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.100
This is the beginning of that, okay?

25:17.100 --> 25:21.460
I'm not sure why the beginning wasn't NASA, the government agency that's dedicated

25:21.460 --> 25:25.860
to space travel and has already been to the moon, but I guess they're not training people

25:25.860 --> 25:29.900
to blow up aliens, so less cool, I guess.

25:29.980 --> 25:33.980
I'm a fan of the Star Trek that's about science and exploration, meeting new aliens

25:33.980 --> 25:36.300
to be their friends, not blow them up.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.580
But I'm obviously not being fair.

25:37.580 --> 25:41.380
Tim isn't here to push conspiracy theories, he says so himself.

25:41.380 --> 25:46.140
I am not here to push stupid conspiracies or anything, I'm just here to have a little

25:46.140 --> 25:48.060
fun with these UFO stories.

25:48.060 --> 25:51.660
And here he is definitely not pushing a conspiracy theory forward.

25:51.660 --> 25:57.300
Is something interesting that should be mentioned, that we have an uptick in all of these credible

25:57.300 --> 26:03.180
stories about UFOs, Navy pilots, going back years, saying this is real, and then all of

26:03.180 --> 26:06.860
a sudden, a space force being signed into law.

26:06.860 --> 26:11.820
Is it possible that in reality, it's not about aliens, it's about the fact the U.S. government

26:11.820 --> 26:16.380
is recognizing finally, and they are, that there is something happening in space and

26:16.380 --> 26:18.100
in the atmosphere we can't understand?

26:18.100 --> 26:20.060
He's just having fun, you guys.

26:20.060 --> 26:23.020
Perhaps now, the Space Force, in the next few years, they're going to be like, look

26:23.020 --> 26:26.940
at this thing we built, even though we've already had the technology for a long time.

26:27.260 --> 26:30.620
I don't know, I don't know, I just like the idea, I think it's fun, I'm not telling

26:30.620 --> 26:34.260
you it's true, I know all the stupid lefties are going to be like, Tim pushes UFO conspiracies

26:34.260 --> 26:37.500
all the time, oh calm down, okay, this story is real, it's from the independent left-wing

26:37.500 --> 26:39.100
side, I think it's just fun to talk about.

26:39.100 --> 26:44.740
And the sad thing is, if Tim limited his videos to discussions about UFOs and big feet, it

26:44.740 --> 26:46.540
would be far less damaging.

26:46.540 --> 26:50.940
Believing in stupid conspiracies isn't nearly as harmful as what he does now, disseminating

26:50.940 --> 26:56.140
right-wing talking points and actively reframing news of the day to fit right-wing narratives.

26:56.940 --> 27:05.500
I don't care about Tim Pool, it's what he represents, that's the problem.

27:05.500 --> 27:10.020
People like Tim Pool, who use their supposed status as being on the left-wing and then

27:10.020 --> 27:14.940
go on to trash the left-wing with right-wing talking points and narratives, will always

27:14.940 --> 27:15.940
exist.

27:15.940 --> 27:20.700
When Tim Pool calls it a day in his career, someone else who uses the same techniques

27:20.700 --> 27:22.220
will show up and take his place.

27:22.220 --> 27:26.340
I'm hoping this exercise in looking at Tim Pool's work will help you see some of the

27:26.340 --> 27:30.380
warning signs in the future, and hopefully you'll be able to spot future Tim Pools

27:30.380 --> 27:32.060
at first glance.

27:32.060 --> 27:35.380
How they'll weigh the benefit of the doubt towards conservatives.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.820
How they'll only read stories superficially.

27:37.820 --> 27:43.140
How they'll dismiss arguments with personal insults and their general reluctance to ever

27:43.140 --> 27:50.020
criticize in any meaningful way, besides someone supposedly disagrees with politically.

27:50.020 --> 27:56.180
Before I go, I just can't resist, using some of the random clips I couldn't find

27:56.180 --> 28:00.400
a place for in this video that just make Tim look stupid.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.420
There is no context for these, I just wanted to dunk on him a little.

28:03.420 --> 28:04.980
So let's have fun doing that.

28:04.980 --> 28:08.660
Here's Tim saying socialism can't work unless you get rid of money.

28:08.660 --> 28:13.180
So the only true socialist or communist system can't have money in it.

28:13.180 --> 28:17.740
Here's Tim saying something obviously not true about the president who has the thinnest

28:17.740 --> 28:18.740
skin ever.

28:18.740 --> 28:21.140
Do you think Trump cares about people calling him bad names?

28:21.140 --> 28:22.140
I don't think so.

28:22.140 --> 28:27.780
Tim apparently believes entitled college kids expect factories to be handed to them.

28:27.780 --> 28:31.260
You look at the factory that someone else put time and energy to build.

28:31.260 --> 28:35.120
All of the workers, whatever your opinion is about labor.

28:35.120 --> 28:36.420
Somebody made a plan.

28:36.420 --> 28:37.700
Somebody worked hard, saved money.

28:37.700 --> 28:38.700
Somebody got a loan.

28:38.700 --> 28:39.700
They hired people.

28:39.700 --> 28:40.700
Everyone contributed to build a factory.

28:40.700 --> 28:47.420
Now you deserve that because you took feminist dance at a local college and you were indoctrinated

28:47.420 --> 28:54.100
into the idea that people shouldn't be allowed to build a company and own property.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.100
Okay, whatever.

28:55.100 --> 28:56.100
Have those opinions.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.260
Here's Tim offering some survival advice.

28:58.260 --> 29:00.020
You can be homeless.

29:00.020 --> 29:01.500
You can have no clothes.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.140
You can be in the middle of the woods.

29:03.140 --> 29:06.620
But you can pick up a rock and congratulations, now you've got something.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.540
You can start doing something.

29:08.540 --> 29:10.500
Go watch ancient technology on YouTube.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.500
I love these channels.

29:11.500 --> 29:12.900
He built a mud hut in an oven.

29:12.900 --> 29:13.900
He got a house.

29:13.900 --> 29:14.900
He builds a house.

29:14.900 --> 29:15.900
It's amazing.

29:15.900 --> 29:16.900
A lot of dirt.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.020
Brilliant.

29:18.020 --> 29:22.860
I don't know how a person naked in the woods watches YouTube, but okay.

29:22.860 --> 29:27.060
Tim mistakenly thinks a common phrase comes from a card game.

29:27.060 --> 29:30.780
There's something I've cited, you know, several times, mostly in the past.

29:30.780 --> 29:32.460
I'll bring it back up.

29:32.460 --> 29:33.780
It's this Magic the Gathering card.

29:33.780 --> 29:36.340
If you're familiar with the game, Magic the Gathering, it's a card game.

29:36.340 --> 29:37.340
Swords to plowshares.

29:37.340 --> 29:42.180
For the record, the phrase actually originates from the Bible, which predates Magic the Gathering

29:42.180 --> 29:44.420
by at least a couple of decades.

29:44.460 --> 29:48.140
I didn't get to any of Tim's horrible videos about British politics, but if you want to

29:48.140 --> 29:51.380
know the sort of experts he consults, here's who he talks to.

29:51.380 --> 29:52.380
I should say this.

29:52.380 --> 29:53.380
I'll defer to Sargon.

29:53.380 --> 29:55.420
Alright, if you guys watch Sargon's content, because he's from there.

29:55.420 --> 29:56.420
He knows better than me.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.900
Also, I thought it was funny that he didn't know how the UK House of Lords works or that

29:59.900 --> 30:00.900
it existed.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.580
Did you know that the UK has a House of Lords?

30:03.580 --> 30:04.620
I didn't understand this.

30:04.620 --> 30:06.540
I thought it was like the House and the Senate.

30:06.540 --> 30:10.620
No, it turns out the House of Lords are like appointees of like land owners from historic

30:10.620 --> 30:11.620
times.

30:11.620 --> 30:15.820
I'm thinking Bernie Sanders was born nearly 100 years ago.

30:15.820 --> 30:16.820
What generation is Bernie in?

30:16.820 --> 30:17.820
He's not a boomer.

30:17.820 --> 30:18.820
No, he's not a boomer.

30:18.820 --> 30:19.820
What is he?

30:19.820 --> 30:20.820
Greatest generation?

30:20.820 --> 30:21.820
I mean, I don't know.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.820
I don't know.

30:22.820 --> 30:23.820
What generation is it?

30:23.820 --> 30:24.820
It's greatest, right?

30:24.820 --> 30:29.340
Bernie is actually a part of the silent generation, but just barely though, he was born in 1942.

30:29.340 --> 30:32.300
Just shy of a few years of being a boomer.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.620
Thank you all for bearing with me.

30:34.620 --> 30:36.620
That was cathartic.

30:36.620 --> 30:42.340
Whenever I make videos looking at some noxious conservative dirtbag, it's not as painful

30:42.340 --> 30:43.580
for me as people think.

30:43.580 --> 30:48.060
And I see all these comments saying, oh, thank you for your sacrifice for suffering through

30:48.060 --> 30:49.060
this.

30:49.060 --> 30:52.220
And while it's not a painless experience, you get used to it pretty quickly.

30:52.220 --> 30:55.900
And when you're only looking at one video or a documentary film, you sort of become

30:55.900 --> 30:58.540
numb to the awfulness.

30:58.540 --> 31:05.700
This though, this was one week of 42 videos watching six a day from Tim Pool.

31:05.700 --> 31:10.300
And ah, this one really, really hurt.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.900
His content is just so bad.

31:12.900 --> 31:16.700
There is so much rambling, so much nonsense.

31:16.700 --> 31:17.820
It was rough.

31:17.820 --> 31:18.820
It was rough.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.860
But I do it all for you.

31:20.860 --> 31:23.580
Those used in particular are my patrons.

31:23.580 --> 31:28.300
But even if you're not a patron, I appreciate anyone who takes their time to watch my videos.

31:28.300 --> 31:32.940
And if you'd like to show me said appreciation, there is of course the aforementioned Patreon

31:32.940 --> 31:37.300
where you could give me a little money to do more videos like this and me or maybe videos

31:37.300 --> 31:41.020
where I get to watch things I enjoy and have fun and tell you about them.

31:41.020 --> 31:46.300
You can also do the usual YouTube things of liking, commenting, subscribing or sharing

31:46.300 --> 31:47.700
this video with friends.

31:47.700 --> 31:48.700
That's cool, too.

31:48.700 --> 31:52.940
You can also follow me on Twitter, ask me some questions on curious cast.

31:52.940 --> 31:58.900
And I'm thinking of doing a new Q&A video probably when I hit my next patron goal, which

31:58.900 --> 32:03.300
has a very short, short, short, short bonus video that everyone will be seeing on this

32:03.300 --> 32:04.300
channel.

32:04.300 --> 32:05.300
And I'll throw in a Q&A.

32:05.300 --> 32:06.300
Because why not?

32:06.300 --> 32:07.300
It's been a while.

32:07.300 --> 32:10.940
I think the last time I did one, I had like 2,500 subscribers.

32:10.940 --> 32:12.380
There are a lot more of you now.

32:12.380 --> 32:15.660
Look for a community post and that's where the questions will go.

32:15.660 --> 32:19.700
Thank you all for watching my video, bye.
