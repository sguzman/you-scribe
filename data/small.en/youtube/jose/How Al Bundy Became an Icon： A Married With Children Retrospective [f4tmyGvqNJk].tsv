0	3600	Friends, I'm going to need a boost to get through this video.
4240	5760	Can I get a Woah Jose?
15760	19520	Married with Children was one of the most controversial hits in television history.
19520	24400	It was beloved by its audience, reviled by critics, and more than once the target of censorship.
24400	28800	It was a brash, loud, obnoxious show about a working-class family that would ring each
28800	34480	other's neck for a spoonful of chili. The spicy sitcom was the antithesis of family TV comedy in
34480	38880	the 1980s and 90s. To understand how a show like this even got on the air in the first place,
38880	43200	we have to set the clock back to before the idea was a glimmer in the eyes of its creators and
43200	48160	start with the founding of the Fox Television Network. In the 1980s, there were only three
48160	53920	major TV networks in the United States, NBC, ABC, and CBS, and this had more or less been the case
53920	58960	for decades. Rupert Murdoch, through his media conglomerate News Corporation, wanted to enter
58960	63680	into the network TV market under the banner of 20th Century Fox, the famed movie studio
63680	69840	which Murdoch had recently acquired. Murdoch spent $2.5 billion purchasing TV stations in
69840	75920	major markets throughout the US and nearly $600 million purchasing TCF, 20th Century Fox's TV
75920	82320	production studio. He would create a new network, the Fox Broadcasting Company, or FBC. This was
82320	87920	quickly rebranded to the much catchier name of Fox. The new network, the fourth of its kind on
87920	93600	American televisions, launched on October 9, 1986, with its only original programming being a late
93600	98640	night chat show starring Joan Rivers, creatively titled The Late Show. The show didn't last more
98640	103520	than a few months, but Fox upped the stakes in 1987, launching two nights of original programming
103520	108560	on Saturdays and Sundays. The Saturday lineup was pretty forgettable with shows such as The New
108560	115360	Adventures of Beans Baxter and Women in Prison, which I assume isn't a porno. On the other hand,
115360	120800	Sunday Nights introduced the world to both Johnny Depp in 21 Jump Street and The Simpsons on the
120800	127440	Tracy Elman show. It also introduced us to The Bundys, stars of the sitcom Married with Children.
128160	134240	A young executive at Fox, Garth and Cierra, tapped Michael Moy and Ron Levitt, the duo responsible
134320	138560	for the sitcom Silver Spoons and It's Your Move, without much money to offer the pair,
138560	143200	and Cierra instead gave them something even more alluring. Creative control in shaping a sitcom,
143200	150080	however they saw fit. The perks were, you know, we didn't get network notes, you know, and no
150720	156560	testing, research and development, all of the usual red tape and crap, and this is what they
156560	161040	sold us. Sick homes of that era typically featured happy, well-functioning families like the kind
161040	166000	you'd see on The Cosby Show, growing pains, or family ties. The successes of these shows led to
166000	171120	a host of imitators. Levitt and Moy were determined not to follow suit. They suspected that the
171120	175280	American public was ready for something different, a show that didn't wrap saccharine messages into
175280	180880	a family-friendly package. Your life sucks, and they all have clean houses and hugs at the end,
181440	186880	and Ron and Mike wanted to do a show where no matter what happened, after you turned it off,
186880	192560	you could feel a little bit better about yourself. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 1989, Levitt and Moy
192560	197200	described what they thought of TV that had a message. I can't believe that you need your
197200	203120	morality taught by the kids on Facts of Life, Levitt says. Yeah, Moy says, if you want to watch
203120	208400	a show and learn about premarital sex, let Alf teach you. The original concept of the show was
208400	213040	inspired by the acts of two popular comedians at the time, Sam Kinison and Roseanne Barr.
213600	216560	Best thing about marriage is that these are connected.
217840	221920	They don't come on. Because if they did, your wife would take it as soon as you got married.
222800	225280	You know, you're married now, you will be needing that.
228080	234640	You know, like clean stuff and cook stuff and help them with their little problems like I care.
237440	241680	I'd rather lay there on the couch criticizing others and then run all the charge cards up to
241680	248480	the limit. The idea of these two being married to one another is the spark that got this show
248480	252880	going. The comedians were even supposedly approached to star in it, only for both to turn
252880	257680	down their respective roles. Though years later, creator Michael Moy would say that if this casting
257680	262080	option was seriously considered, he was never consulted about it. Levitt and Moy preferred
262080	266080	the actors cast in the roles to be unknowns without pre-existing personas. They wanted
266080	269840	the Bundy family to be a unique creation. Together, they wrote a pilot script that
269840	273840	thumbed its nose at sitcom conventions. It was a pilot that would be a game changer.
274400	279200	Although the existence of this series is held up as an example of how times have changed,
279200	283280	as if this show could never be produced today because the politically correct have taken over
283280	287360	the airwaves and destroyed comedy, it's worth noting that when that pilot script was first seen
287360	292160	by the network, it wasn't warmly received. The hands-off approach promised to Levitt and Moy
292160	296400	would eventually vanish and suddenly the research department came in with suggestions of making the
296400	319600	Bundy's more loving. Levitt and Moy resisted input from the research department and they were
319600	324800	backed by Ann Cyr, but luck was on their side as well. Fox was a new network and in desperate need
324800	328960	of content, so they were given far more leeway than they might have gotten on another network.
328960	333440	With their debut only a few weeks away, the Fox executives didn't have time to plug up holes in
333440	338880	their schedule. It wasn't the more lax standards towards political correctness that got married
338880	344160	with children on the airwaves. The real cause is more likely the unique circumstances in which this
344160	348720	series was created around. I suspect that worked in the favor of Levitt and Moy getting their way
348720	353840	on making this the show they wanted to see. And the show they wanted starred an unconventional
353840	359600	family. The Bundy's were headed by its patriarch, Al Bundy, played by Ed O'Neill, a dramatic actor
359600	365200	with no comedy experience. O'Neill was one of the last actors cast after a very lengthy search.
365200	370320	It was his unique take on the character that really sealed the role for him, resigned to his fate of
370320	374640	being married to a wife who sat around all day with kids who treated him like a cash machine,
374640	381280	all while working at a job he hated, selling women's shoes. The perpetual loser often seen with a hand
381280	384960	stuffed down the front of his pants. Al had a rough charm to him that made him an underdog
384960	390000	he wanted to root for, even when he was ogling women or stealing from innocent people. He had
390000	396160	a strange magnetism to him. Al Bundy would define Ed O'Neill's career for a long time to come.
396160	425840	Al's wife Peggy was played by Katie Seagal, and her fiery
425840	431040	personality was completed with her signature tall red hair. Originally written as a couch potato,
431040	435520	it was Katie Seagal who decided to play Peggy as someone who saw herself as a hot chick married
435520	440320	to a loser, and she helped define her unique fashion sense, taken from the look of a housewife
440320	446560	in the 1960s. It created a vision of Peggy as a mother you wouldn't see on other TV shows. Peggy
446560	451760	was the anti-housewife. She would sooner spend the day watching Oprah and eating bonbons than go
451760	470800	grocery shopping or talk to her children. The Bundy children, Kelly and Bud, were originally
470800	475920	played by Tina Kaspery and Hunter Carson. They even filmed the series pilot with the two of them,
475920	479280	but the producers felt they didn't quite fit into the role, and they were recast.
479840	484480	Christina Applegate and David Faustino would take their place. Although they were loud and bratty
484480	488720	from the get-go, these characters would be more meaningfully defined as the series progressed.
488720	491280	The only constant throughout the series was their bitter bickering.
504480	508720	The Bundys were joined by their neighbors, Steve and Marcy Rhodes. David Garrison was the first
508720	513520	person cast for the series, having worked with Leave It in Moy on It's Your Move. Steve Rhodes
513520	518880	was the smarmy, yuppy, newlywed next-door who walked with an unearned sense of accomplishment,
518880	536800	the complete opposite of Al. His wife Marcy, played by Amanda Burce, grew considerably
536880	540800	throughout the series, going from a demure woman who subtly controlled her husband,
540800	544480	to an outspoken feminist who embodied the worst of liberal hypocrisy.
566800	576560	And last, but certainly not least, was the Bundy's faithful dog Buck, played by a Briard
576560	582000	conveniently named Buck. This very good boy would typically be seen sitting around the
582000	585200	Bundy living room pondering the many mysteries of the universe.
588160	592000	The world was introduced to the Bundy family for the first time on April 5th,
592000	597280	1987. The pilot for this show established a few basics right from the get-go.
597280	600240	First of all, the kids do not get along.
606160	610080	We also see the role money plays in the cast-strapped Bundy household. It's what the
610080	613600	kids expect from Al instead of love, and it's how Peg controls him.
622720	635600	Al working in the shoe store shows us another familiar sight,
635600	638080	him struggling with a heavyset customer.
645040	651680	And that was the first of many, many fat woman jokes. These jokes were defense mechanisms for
651680	656320	Al, a way of striking back against customers who treat him poorly and indirectly, although
656320	660800	against the horrible life he finds himself trapped in. It doesn't excuse the jokes, of course,
660800	665200	but it does give us some context to understand where Al is coming from, an ignorant man broken
665200	670480	by his crappy job striking out at an easy target. We also meet a small addition to the cast,
670480	676160	the character Luke Ventura, played by Rich Scheidner, Al's co-worker at the shoe store.
676160	680160	He appeared in a few episodes in season one, but disappeared by the time the second season
680160	684240	rolled around. His job was to be the single guy who would make Al regret getting married.
690000	693920	Luke Ventura also gives me the chance to mention the naming convention for characters on this show.
693920	698080	Most people assume the Bundys were named after serial killer Ted Bundy, but they were actually
698080	702560	named after pro wrestler King Kong Bundy. The Rhodeses were named after Dusty Rhodes,
702560	706240	and Luke Ventura was named after Jesse The Body Ventura.
706240	708480	Is it okay if my family comes for a visit?
710000	713920	Well, it doesn't really matter what you say. Besides, how bad can it be?
720240	724160	The second act of the show is taken up by a visit from Steve and Marcy Rhodes,
724160	728240	the newlyweds who have just moved in next door to the Bundys. Steve and Marcy are,
728880	734240	well, they're not like the Bundys. I feel that sports glorify violence and competition,
734240	739280	and I don't think it's psychologically healthy. When we have a child, we don't want it to grow up
739280	745280	with that winning-is-the-only-thing attitude. A child is better off not being exposed to sports.
746240	747520	You're gonna neuter him, too?
749760	753360	And this really encapsulates the relationship between the Bundys and the Rhodes in these first
753360	759360	few seasons. The gentle sensibilities of Steve and Marcy are mocked and degraded by Alan Pegg.
759360	762480	It's like when you're sitting somewhere and they come over and they say to you,
763360	769520	what are you thinking? And you start thinking, you know, if I wanted you to know, I'd be talking.
772320	776480	You've got a good thing going. Don't start letting him have a good time
776480	781360	alone. But we still have a good time together. Then why is he staying up?
783760	787040	And soon the Bundys have pulled the Rhodeses into their misery.
787600	790400	I demand to know what you do late at night after I've gone to bed.
791360	792800	Are you having fun alone, Steve?
797280	799520	No, I'd just like to stay up and think.
801440	802240	What are you thinking?
804400	805840	Well, if I wanted you to know, I'd...
810320	812800	Al, I'll see you next week at the game.
812800	815760	Peggy, I think we'll be spending a lot of time together.
816320	818400	Come on, Steve. We've got to talk.
818400	820800	I'll make it quick. I'm going to watch boxing.
820800	822560	You'll watch nothing.
824560	828640	When the Rhodeses show up, I can't help but be reminded of Edward Albee's play Who's
828640	833440	Afraid of Virginia Woolf, the story of an older married couple that invites over newlyweds for
833440	839200	dinner and then subjects them to a night of mind games. In that play, George and Martha,
839200	844480	aimed for the first US president and his wife, contrast the illusions and promises of America.
844480	848720	We see echoes of that in Married with Children, though in this case, the promise of the happy
848720	854160	nuclear family is being undermined by the miserable reality of the Bundy clan. And while
854160	858960	the Rhodeses think their lives are on a different track, Al and Peggy are ready to pull them back
858960	864800	down to reality, or at least their version of reality. The style of comedy is undeniably
864800	869760	a farce with over-the-top acting and jokes that slap you in the face. The show's sense
869760	876800	of humor was rapid and constant. Even though some of it is problematic, particularly Al's
876800	881600	one-man war against overweight women, quite a bit of it stands up surprisingly well, especially
881600	887200	considering it was written over 30 years ago. The pilot premiered with little fanfare and even
887200	891680	smaller ratings. Fox was still an unknown and had trouble attracting an audience who weren't even
891680	896880	sure how to tune into the channel. That said, Married with Children quickly became its top sitcom
896880	901040	and even got a slightly warm reception from some critics. Over the years, that would change,
901040	906240	though. A major topic in the first season is Al's manhood in the modern world. Al is very much a
906240	911600	relic beholden to his days as a high school football star, bitter that his life peaked at 18.
911600	915840	Now his dreams are much simpler, like wanting an extra bathroom that's all his own.
926880	954480	Einstein had his own room. You think Einstein invented the theory of relativity in his wife's
954480	959760	exercise room? No, he was in his own room with the door closed. Al arguing that a man deserves
959760	964800	a room of his own is a direct inversion of Virginia Woolf's essay, A Room of One's Own,
964800	969840	a feminist work which argued for women to have space to enter the literary tradition. Al very
969840	975680	explicitly opines for the days when men had all the privileges and women had, well, all the chores
975680	982080	and the children. And Al argues for these good old days using feminist rhetoric. And keep in mind,
982080	988160	this is Al talking about being an oppressed man in 1987. Al is right about his life sucking. He's
988160	992400	a working class man trying to support a family in a world that's making it tougher all the time,
992400	997200	but instead of complaining about low wages or lack of benefits, he mistakenly shifts the blame
997200	1003200	on to women wanting equal rights. Al is a reactionary. One of the binds the series puts
1003200	1008160	us in is that Al is also our hero. Although he would remain explicitly anti-woman throughout
1008160	1012640	the series, what's surprising is to see how the audience very quickly started taking his side of
1012640	1017680	things. In season one, there were still some pushback like with this line. Look, I'm not sexist.
1017680	1022880	I'm just saying women don't know nothing. This shows us a version of Al that is meant to be a
1022880	1027920	fool to be laughed at, not a hero to be supported. But even in the first few seasons, he wasn't
1027920	1033600	completely unredeemable and he had a few genuinely admirable qualities. Strangely enough, Al has a
1033600	1037920	number of opportunities to hook up with beautiful women throughout the series, but he manages to
1037920	1042640	stay faithful to peg throughout it all. In the first season episode, Al loses his cherry,
1042640	1046880	we see Al tempted by one of the many vacuous blondes that will inhabit the series.
1059040	1061040	Al eventually does the right thing.
1067920	1087200	He goes back to peg, but he does make it a little creepy.
1087200	1100000	So Al is gross, we all know that, but he shows us some character in this episode,
1100000	1104400	not cheating on his wife, which, as we can see from peg at home, would really hurt her.
1104400	1109040	This is about establishing Al, for all his faults, isn't a complete bastard.
1109040	1113280	What's interesting is how the show presents characters. They're absurd and over the top,
1113280	1117840	and the cherry sister in particular play into a gross male fantasy of the vacant blonde,
1117840	1122080	but they're being deployed in a slightly more sophisticated way. The temptation of Al is a
1122080	1126800	genuine test because it risks the very foundations of the premise, that is, a married couple at the
1126800	1131920	center of this entire sitcom. The show can't continue if the married couple and married with
1131920	1136480	children are no longer married. The idea behind the comedy here is that Al and Peg don't
1136480	1140560	mean the nasty things they say to each other, and deep down there's some real love there.
1140560	1144960	If Al or Peg cheated on the other, it would violate that implication. What this show has
1144960	1149760	at its core is the idea of a deep love that transcends romance and lust. The fact that it
1149760	1154880	acknowledges temptation is actually kind of realistic. Al and the Bundys generally are
1154880	1159600	rough people who do bad things, but they aren't completely unredeemable. Funnily enough, this is
1159600	1164240	how the seed is planted, taking them from being objects of ridicule to underdogs the audience can
1164240	1169120	cheer for. I also really like this episode because Peg apparently watches my YouTube channel.
1176560	1181840	Thanks, Peggy. The poverty of the Bundys is a huge reason as to why they live so miserably.
1181840	1186400	The Bundys are the traditional nuclear family struggling to survive at a new status quo of the
1186400	1190960	1980s, and this new reality doesn't have room for the Bundys. Stephen Marcy are part of the
1190960	1195680	new order. The one the Bundys sneer at. The people who move in next door who have a much happier
1195680	1200160	marriage and more successful careers. They aren't massively successful, but they're doing better
1200160	1204640	than the Bundys. And by the end of the season, they're already looking down at their poor
1204640	1209680	neighbors. Just like how everyone else looks down on the Bundys. And it must suck to feel like
1209680	1215760	everyone is looking down at you. Thank you, Father Kids. Thanks, Dad. The second season
1215760	1220160	established more of the show's tone, including its tendency to tell absurd stories. It opens
1220240	1225760	with a two parter that has the Bundys going on vacation to dump water Florida. Upon getting
1225760	1231040	there, they are attacked by a genuine axe murderer. Kids, get dressed. We're leaving.
1231040	1233520	But we like it here. Suit yourself, Peg.
1235840	1240240	Al, we are not leaving the children. Well, what's wrong? There's someone in our room.
1241680	1248480	That's him. And they react in typical Bundy fashion, stealing and kicking ass. It's safe.
1250640	1252240	Steal everything that's not tied down.
1254880	1257360	Pack up. We'll go downstairs, get a refund. Hit the road.
1258640	1260800	Pack this. We can always use a fork.
1266320	1270480	This is one of the many times we'll be seeing the Bundys doing both of these things. It's a
1270480	1275600	gentle reminder that while they are our protagonists and aren't as bad as a literal axe murderer,
1275600	1279520	they're not so great themselves. That again, everyone in the show's world seems to be an
1279520	1283600	asshole like the townsfolk who let the murderer off so they can keep one of their major tourist
1283600	1291120	attractions. What are you doing? Making sure you didn't hurt him. See Bundy, dump water ain't much
1291120	1296960	of a town. We only got two things, a serial killer and the man who met Andy Griffith.
1299440	1303280	The Bundys live in a cynical world where everyone is chasing money, something the
1303280	1307600	Bundys lack. In fact, the only reason Bundys were at this hellhole was because it was the
1307600	1312720	only vacation they could afford. We can get an example of what wealthier Bundys might be like in
1312720	1316720	Master the Possibilities. The Bundys mistakenly think they don't have to pay the bill on a
1316720	1320880	credit card that was accidentally given to Buck, giving them a taste of living the sweet life.
1320880	1340800	It also reveals that they believe a few things about being rich, like it buys you social
1340800	1345440	permission to be a jerk. It's here we see that the Bundys are much happier when they aren't fighting
1345440	1355040	over the few scraps they have. Everyone in the world is obsessed with money, and the Bundys are
1355040	1359200	showing us what happens to a family without any. It's a powerful counterpoint to the obsessive
1359200	1363920	consumerism of the 1980s. The chase for money makes both the rich and poor much harsher to
1363920	1368880	everyone around them. One of the memorable moments in season two happens in the episode
1368960	1373680	You Better Watch Out, where a mall promotion featuring a parachuting Santa went awry.
1373680	1390400	I really appreciate the contrast and reactions between the roads and the Bundys.
1404640	1408640	While this might have ruined Christmas for any other family, the Bundys have a rare victory
1408640	1413040	when they realize Santa's sack was filled with coupons for the new mall. This really captures
1413040	1417440	the spirit of married with children. Christmas, the traditional family holiday, is really just
1417440	1422080	about the presents, and the Bundys cut through the sentimental mask that disguises that materialism.
1422080	1427040	The Bundy house is where Santa goes to die, but he can leave the presents. A fun bit of
1427040	1431280	trivia is that, according to show co-creator Michael Moy, the idea of Santa falling to his
1431280	1436160	death in a failed stunt at Christmas time was taken from the childhood memories of one of the
1436160	1442000	writers on the show. On second thought, maybe that trivia isn't so much fun. And before leaving
1442000	1447200	season two entirely, it also gave us one of my favorite running gags in the show, The Bundy Cheer.
1461280	1467520	I've purposely avoided talking about another thing married with children was increasingly
1467520	1472480	getting a rep for, and that's having beautiful men and women, although more often than not women,
1472480	1477360	showing some skin. This helped attract the younger demographic Fox had been hunting for,
1477360	1482640	but the network was growing increasingly wary of the salacious imagery and plot lines of the series.
1482640	1486880	This set the stage for the notorious episode, Her Cup's Runneth Over,
1486880	1491920	written by Stacy Sprong and Marcy Vosberg. In this episode, Peg's birthday is ruined when
1491920	1497360	she finds out her favorite bra is being discontinued. Alan and Steve go on a road trip to a special
1497360	1502560	lingerie store in Wisconsin to track down Peg's favorite bra, and engage in some saucy antics
1502560	1507920	featuring women in lingerie. This episode happened to catch the eye of Terri Ricolta,
1507920	1512000	a housewife in Michigan. The story goes that she had been letting her children have free
1512000	1516400	reign of the television when she noticed they were watching this particular episode of Married
1516400	1520800	with Children. Ricolta was so upset she was moved to call into the network to complain about the
1520800	1525440	show. Fox being new to the whole network thing didn't have a department to field complaint
1525440	1530400	calls. So, amazingly, they forwarded the call to one of the writers responsible for the episode,
1530400	1534560	Marcy Vosberg. Both women provided their own versions of that conversation.
1546480	1551200	But we're just trying something a little bit new, and I said, we sort of take a British approach
1551200	1556080	to censorship. If it's offensive, you can always change the channel. Very condescending tones,
1556080	1562480	she said. You know, this is a body program. We are pushing the envelope of television.
1563200	1570000	Our viewing audience is an adult, viewer drinking male, 18 to 35 years old. She said, and finally,
1570000	1573360	Mrs. Ricolta, if you don't like what you're seeing, I suggest to you that you just stand up,
1573440	1578000	walk over to the television and turn it off. Ricolta, undeterred by the phone call, wrote to
1578000	1582080	the heads of the various companies advertising their products on Married with Children,
1582080	1586240	and she convinced many of them to start pulling their ads. Married with Children was being
1586240	1591200	attacked by a one-woman boycott. An article from the New York Times describes her success.
1592080	1597280	Proctor and Gamble, McDonald's, Tam Brands, and Kimberly Clark have instructed their advertising
1597280	1602880	agencies not to buy further time on the program Married with Children. In an interview, the
1602880	1607280	Michigan woman, Terry Ricolta, said she has objected to the program because of its blatant
1607280	1613440	exploitation of women and sex and anti-family attitudes. But what parts of this episode really
1613440	1618000	bothered Ricolta? I'm going to pick out a handful of the more controversial moments of this episode,
1618000	1622960	at least in the eyes of someone living in 1988, and I want you to guess which two were the ones
1622960	1628000	that, for Terry Ricolta, crossed the line. Do you know what happened if men had breasts? We wouldn't
1628000	1635200	need women anymore. And if you had what other men have, I wouldn't need batteries anymore.
1638640	1641360	Don't be embarrassed. We often cater to people like you.
1642160	1645520	Now, what size does your boyfriend like to see you in?
1647840	1652560	No, no, no. You don't understand. We're married. And not to each other, too.
1653520	1658000	And if I was gay, I'd like to think I could do better than him.
1659760	1661440	Steve, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
1663360	1666080	Oh, come on, Al. She was asking for it. You see how she's dressed.
1671440	1674720	Isn't there something we can do about this? We can dance.
1674720	1676720	No!
1678000	1682480	Happy birthday, dragon! If you were my boyfriend, would you like this?
1687920	1691520	Or do you think he'd like it better, without the bra, like this?
1691520	1708080	Yeah, you're right. I don't need the bra. Well, I gotta go. Bar exam tomorrow.
1715360	1718640	Okay, so which of those two clips really set off Ricolta?
1719120	1723440	Let's go back to the Times article to find out. In an interview, she said she was
1723440	1728640	appalled by the sexual innuendo and treatment of women on the program, particularly its references
1728640	1734720	to homosexuality and a sequence featuring a woman publicly removing her bra. So it was the reference
1734720	1740720	to gay men and the hand bra. While the hand bra, I can understand, it's pretty chilling to think
1740720	1745600	mentioning characters might be gay was enough to offend someone. It's a strong reminder of how far
1745600	1750400	gay rights have come in the last 30 years. The Ricolta boycott, although seemingly a threat at
1750400	1755120	first, backfired pretty spectacularly. It gave Married with Children a national spotlight,
1755120	1759440	and what was already the most popular show on Fox got a huge boost in the ratings from people
1759440	1763280	coming by to see what all the fuss was about. Here's an excerpt from an Entertainment Weekly
1763280	1769120	article in 1990, one year after the boycott began. The show is as raucous as ever, the audience has
1769120	1773920	grown, and advertisers are still advertising. A number of sponsors that wrote letters of support
1774000	1778480	to Ricolta have continued to run commercials in Married, some could even be called heavy
1778480	1784880	advertisers. In short, free speech is safe. From Terry Ricolta. Ricolta, who has since formed
1784880	1790000	Americans for Reasonable Television, a media watchdog organization that publishes a monthly
1790000	1795120	newsletter for 2,000 subscribers, concedes that her campaign brought more publicity to Married,
1795120	1799840	and probably more viewers. I'm still waiting for that fruit basket from Fox, she says.
1800640	1805120	As the ratings have climbed, so have the rates charged for 30 seconds of commercial time.
1805120	1811520	Last spring, a half minute went for 65,000. These days, the cost is 100,000 to 120,000,
1811520	1817520	roughly equal to the rates of an NBC Sunday night movie. It was so hot Married with Children managed
1817520	1823200	to set a record-breaking increase in viewership. According to Ricolta, her real problem was with
1823200	1827920	Married with Children airing before 9pm, which apparently made it more likely to find its way
1827920	1833360	in front of younger audiences. At the time, the sitcom had been airing at 8.30pm. Fox did push
1833360	1837840	it back to 9pm the following season, though it was moving with a significantly larger audience,
1837840	1842640	and it would grow larger still. The network also had one strange reaction to the boycott.
1842640	1847600	To take the upcoming episode, I'll See You in Court, off the schedule entirely. It was an
1847600	1852160	episode about the Bundy's and Rhodes' visiting a love motel where their Night of Passion was
1852160	1857040	secretly recorded, leading to a showdown where they take the hotel owners to court.
1857040	1861840	Fox considered this episode too controversial for television, and it didn't air until several
1861840	1867600	years later, well after the series ended, on June 18th, 2002. Although a decent episode,
1867600	1872400	it didn't really live up to the hype. Season 3 had a few other highlights I want to mention
1872400	1876560	before moving on. Both Bud and Kelly became more developed as characters in this season.
1876560	1881360	For instance, Bud started committing hair crimes. As a hair choice like this would suggest,
1881360	1885840	Bud's journey through puberty was a lonely one. From here on out, we'll be seeing Bud,
1885840	1890320	the relatively intelligent Bundy, feel the need to prove his manhood by hooking up with a girl,
1890320	1893520	or in the majority of cases, as close as he can get to one.
1894480	1896640	The day I stoop low enough to date a mannequin
1897600	1901200	is the day I truly earned the name Bundy.
1913200	1917440	On the complete opposite end of the spectrum, Kelly proves herself to be very successful in
1917440	1921520	her dating life, although she also distinguishes herself as the dimmest of the Bundy's.
1924000	1941840	I think this is where Christina Applegate really started to distinguish herself.
1941840	1945920	Although the Kelly character would be trapped in this endless cycle of being the
1945920	1950720	dumb blonde who hooks up with countless guys, Applegate was able to deliver her lines with
1950720	1955520	a refreshing energy that really demonstrated she had a talent for comedy. She'd go on to be one
1955520	1959920	of the breakout stars of the show, and part of it was being able to pull off moments like this one.
1981680	1986880	One of the well-established tropes of this series up to this point is that
1986880	1989360	Al sees having sex with Peg as a chore.
1990080	2010720	It's not that he doesn't find Peg attractive, because she's lost her looks or anything like
2010720	2015840	that, it's because she's his wife. It's the routine of sex that has reduced Al's interest
2015840	2021920	in it, at least with Peggy. To compensate, Peggy uses a variety of schemes that trick Al into bed.
2021920	2026720	Small content warning for sexual violence, because a few of these clips are a bit disturbing.
2026720	2029760	Skip ahead to the time scene below if you'd like to avoid this section.
2029760	2046880	While it's typically done through guile or some other form of manipulation,
2046880	2051520	the more problematic aspect of this becomes apparent when roles are reversed in the fourth
2051520	2056240	season premiere. In Hot Off the Grill, Al decides to celebrate Labor Day with a barbecue.
2059760	2078960	Al, using his day off to its fullest, demands Peg start cleaning and doing other chores around
2078960	2083280	the house. This turns out on.
2097600	2102320	And this happens several times this episode, the running gag being that instead of Al not wanting
2102320	2106640	to have sex, it's Peg who doesn't want to do it because she's just too tired.
2120800	2125600	Cut out the laughter and applause, and this scene looks dramatically different. Perhaps it might
2125600	2130240	have seemed like an easier subject for humor when the big strong man is acquiescing to the weaker
2130240	2135200	wife, but that in and of itself is problematic. Non-consensual sex, whether it comes through
2135200	2140720	physical force or mental manipulation, is sexual assault. Al and Peg have somehow worked it into
2140720	2144960	their strange marriage, but there's still something very disturbing about making light of it.
2145520	2150880	Certain aspects of the show have aged surprisingly well, but this isn't one of them. If anything,
2150880	2155600	looking at this from 2020, it often feels more uncomfortable than funny.
2155600	2160560	One major highlight for season 4 was the hour-long special, It's a Bundyful Life. As the name
2160560	2165360	suggests, it's a married with children take on the classic Christmas movie, It's a Wonderful Life.
2165360	2169200	Rather than some of the first part myself, I'll let Al's poetry fill you in.
2185600	2209120	In a second half of the story, Al's repairing of the Christmas lights goes wrong.
2215600	2224800	And Al is met by his guardian angel, Sam Kinesen, the very comedian who inspired the
2224800	2243680	character of Al Bundy. As you might have guessed,
2243680	2247040	Al gets to see what the world would have been like had he not been born.
2261040	2262880	How we meet the man who takes Al's place.
2266960	2271600	That's Ted McGinley playing Norman Jablonsky. We'll be seeing more of him in season 5
2271600	2287680	in a completely different role. Things aren't going well for guardian angel Sam Kinesen.
2287680	2291440	Turns out it's very difficult to give Al a reason to want to live. Until…
2301600	2307120	they're happy. Not a care in the world. You think I'm going to let that happen
2307120	2315440	after all the grief they put me through? I want to live! And Al returns home.
2331600	2351520	This was a twist on the It's a Wonderful Life concept that's actually original,
2351520	2355600	even if it's just an inversion, and what it so beautifully captures is the power of
2355600	2359440	spite to someone in a world they think has turned against them. If someone were to say
2359440	2363760	the world would be better off if you didn't exist, that can create some real bitterness.
2363760	2368960	Biting back against that is at the heart of who Al is. He won't go away, even if it would make
2368960	2374160	the world a better place. This speaks to that aggrieved reactionary narrative so well. The old
2374160	2379440	status quo being undoubtedly replaced means guys like Al are getting a smaller piece of the pie,
2379440	2384880	or in Al's case, the smaller piece of the pie he was promised in his youth. This wasn't the way
2384880	2390080	things were supposed to turn out for him. But I need to stress, Al being erased isn't speaking
2390080	2395120	to a reality, just a feeling that it's happening. Married with Children is presenting us the world
2395120	2400480	through a warped lens, one that sneers at the facade of the happy family that other sitcoms
2400480	2406560	pretend exist, or at least pretend exist in every home. Married with Children isn't intentionally
2406560	2412160	pushing an aggrieved white conservative male narrative on purpose, it's that the very conceit
2412160	2418240	of the series carries that implicit bias. On its original broadcast, this became the highest
2418240	2425360	rated episode of the series, achieving 31.4 million viewers. A major turning point in season 4 was the
2425360	2429840	growing influence of the Bundys on their neighbors, the Roses, and I don't just mean the increasing
2429840	2434560	animosity between Al and Marcy. But doesn't anybody know this is against the law? So I was
2434560	2448640	dressing up a chicken and calling it your wife. I am not a chicken. Why does he keep calling me a
2448640	2456240	chicken? By the time the fourth season rolls around, the once happy newlyweds are well on
2456240	2461520	their way to becoming Al and Peg. When I was dating you, I had a few milk bones slipped into my pocket.
2465520	2475360	I was pretty. My mother told me so. Compared to your mother you were. So now you don't like my
2475360	2479520	mother. What's not to like? A 60 year old woman who played the drums. Aside from the bickering,
2479520	2484880	there was the added pain of Steve getting wrapped up in one of Al's schemes, a shoe themed hotline.
2484880	2490400	The trial had everything. Crying, that was Mr. Rhodes. He lost his job, you know. And then
2490400	2497200	there was an honest-to-goodness fit. That was Mrs. Rhodes. She got demoted to drive up window teller.
2499040	2504480	While it seemed like Al was shaping Steve into him, he started to more closely resemble Peggy.
2504480	2508080	I've been thinking, I don't really want to work.
2510000	2516400	It's boring. I'm having fun not working. Peggy says, well, Marcy says you're working, leech man.
2517360	2522240	The degradation of their marriage also reveals more to the Steve and Marcy characters. Their
2522240	2528080	veneer of tolerant, open-minded liberals is ripped away to reveal, much like the Bundy's, what terms
2528080	2534320	them on is money. I mean, when I first married Steve, he was a greedy, materialistic pig.
2535120	2543360	He'd step on an old lady for a dollar. God, how he excited me. Though they don't quite go full Bundy,
2543440	2548000	they not only have the experience of having had money, but there are no kids to weigh them down.
2548000	2553840	Marcy becoming Al is very interesting since the bitterness of working a low-paying job is almost
2553840	2559440	instantaneous. This is apparently what low-wage work will do to someone in this world, particularly
2559440	2564960	if they're in a single-income family and their partner refuses to work. It's taxing not just
2564960	2569840	financially but psychologically. It also shows us the precariousness of the relatively lavish
2569840	2574720	lifestyle of the Roses. They're one firing and demotion away from their lives and marriages
2574720	2579440	crumbling. All of this was setting up the groundwork for the first major change in the show's cast,
2579440	2583680	the departure of David Garrison. Although there was no bad blood between him or any involved in
2583680	2588080	the show's production, in his heart, he was primarily a theater actor, and he left to pursue
2588080	2593200	that interest. In the context of the show, Steve's departure would be explained as him running off to
2593200	2597920	be a park ranger, but he would be back a few more times over the years. Season 4 also gave us one
2598000	2600880	more important first. We finally get to hear Buck speak.
2620960	2625520	Buck has many internal monologues over the years and even a few Buck-centric episodes.
2625520	2630400	He was voiced by Kevin Carran, a writer for the series. Though in the handful of Buck-centric
2630400	2634800	episodes, where Buck has more than a handful of lines, he's voiced by Cheech Marin.
2639520	2643440	Married with Children continued to get even more popular with the start of its fifth season,
2643440	2646480	which is pretty easy to understand when you look at what other shows were out there.
2655520	2669120	Even the opening to season 5 starts with a great moment that captures what this show is all about.
2669120	2687280	What you may have noticed in many of these clips is how raucous the audience is getting.
2687280	2692000	Back in season 4 we started getting loud ovations from pretty much every first entrance of a member
2692000	2696640	of the principal cast. Married with Children was very quickly distinguishing itself for having one
2696640	2701520	of the most vocal audiences. If you listen closely to this clip, you can hear someone shout,
2701520	2702240	Don't do it.
2716800	2719840	And this was far from being the only time something like this happened.
2719840	2724080	You can hear the audience shouting out in a number of scenes, and this is my favorite example.
2726640	2743760	How much do people love this show if they're cheering a dog getting a hookup?
2743760	2749440	In an article for New York Magazine, Hollywood sound engineer John Bicklehopped describes his
2749440	2754880	time on the show. Married with Children, he says, was amazing. I worked on that show for years and
2755200	2759840	years, and honestly, I had little to do except clean up edits. That owed a lot to careful casting
2759840	2764720	of the crowd. Married, he says, often had audiences packed with Marines and service people who
2764720	2776080	responded to the show's aggressive anti-PC humor. The audience serves as a good indicator of where
2776080	2780960	the show will be heading in the future. The strongest reactions were typically for sexy women
2780960	2785920	or anti-PC humor, and both would become more prominent in later season. Here's an example
2785920	2787520	from just one season later.
2811280	2816320	The laughter makes sense, but the cheering? Al is supposed to be in the wrong, the out-of-touch
2816320	2819680	loser to be mocked because the audience is supposed to feel as though they're better than
2819680	2824880	him. But by being the star of a beloved sitcom, all that goodwill is turning him into a folk hero,
2824880	2830640	and Al using a white reactionary victimhood narrative creates an implicit support for that
2830640	2835200	point of view. Season 5 took another big step in the show's evolution with the episode,
2835200	2840080	Married with Who?, where we meet our old friend Ted McGinley, only now he's playing a different
2840160	2846960	character, Marcy's new husband, Jefferson Darcy. The marriage was a product of a one-night stand.
2847920	2873200	The dynamic here is Jefferson is a mooching, pretty boy conman,
2873200	2878000	leaving off of Marcy's wealth. This wasn't the first time Ted McGinley was a late addition to a
2878000	2882080	sitcom. Before coming to Marry with Children, he joined the cast of both Happy Days and The
2882080	2886400	Love Boat in their later seasons, something that was cutely referenced in later episodes of
2886400	2904960	Married with Children. It took the audience a while to warm up to Jefferson. According to
2904960	2909600	McGinley, it was about two seasons, but in my opinion I think he fit into the cast quite nicely,
2909600	2933120	right from the get-go. With Married with Children writing so high,
2933120	2937440	it was only natural for Fox to want to capitalize on that success, and that's how we got the first
2937440	2942720	attempt at creating a spin-off. In Oldies But Youngins, we meet Al's friend, Charlie Verducci,
2942720	2948160	played by Joseph Bologna, whose son is dating Kelly. His name is Vinny, and he's played by a
2948160	2967040	young Matt LeBlanc. A few episodes later, Married with Children would go the extra mile using its
2967040	2973040	100th episode to give audiences a stealth pilot for the spin-off show, Top of the Heap. In this
2973040	2977280	episode, the only regular cast member to appear was Al in a small cameo. The rest of the time,
2977280	2982480	we hang out with the Verducci's, a father-son duo who are trying to hatch a forgettable plot to get
2982480	2987120	rich. There was only one really great moment, and that's the part where Matt LeBlanc pretends to
2987120	2993920	box with Mr. Fluffy the Cat, who performed under his own name. That is such a talented cat. Top
2994000	2999440	of the Heap would build on this bland episode to premiere on April 7th, 1991. It was the first and
2999440	3005040	most successful of the Married with Children spin-offs, lasting a grand total of six episodes.
3005040	3010240	Not counting the pilot. A year later, the spin-off somehow got a spin-off of its own, titled Vinny
3010240	3015440	and Bobby, with Matt LeBlanc once again playing Vinny, only now his co-star is Robert Torti,
3015440	3020960	playing his roommate Bobby Grazo. The show made the disastrous decision to cut out the clear star
3020960	3025680	of the previous series, Mr. Fluffy the Cat, but it ended up being slightly more successful,
3025680	3032080	blazing past the old series' six-episode run to reach a grand total of seven episodes.
3032640	3037040	For Matt LeBlanc's sake, a year later, he would find himself on Friends and become a big star.
3037040	3041360	Friends, by the way, also featured Christina Applegate, who would guest-star on a few
3041360	3046560	episodes playing Rachel's sister. There's no word of what happened to Mr. Fluffy the Cat, though.
3046560	3050640	And one last highlight from season five I need to mention is we are introduced to Al's favorite
3050640	3054160	TV show, a western titled Psychodad.
3080640	3092720	Season six carried the momentum of season five and continued the trend of strong ratings. The
3092720	3097360	Ricotta controversy was long gone, but another powerful driver of attention for the show was
3097360	3103120	that, with over 100 episodes in its library, it now qualified for syndication. It was voraciously
3103120	3108080	snapped up by networks, as the early seasons in particular had such underwhelming ratings in their
3108160	3112800	initial run that it was like buying a bunch of forgotten episodes for a hit TV series.
3112800	3116720	This brought in even more new viewers hungry for more married-with-children.
3116720	3119840	The premiere for season six brought with it a major change.
3138080	3144000	The reaction from the family isn't great.
3144000	3167280	The
3167280	3170960	plot line was written into the series as, in real life, Katie Seagal was pregnant,
3170960	3174000	and it let her appear on camera without having to hide that fact.
3174000	3178640	Also, a third child is the exact sort of bad luck that Al would have. Seagal was clearly
3178640	3182560	far along in her pregnancy at the time, and a few months into the new season, she would leave the
3182560	3187840	series for four episodes. I have to talk about some heavy stuff now, so consider this a content
3187840	3192320	warning, particularly for anyone who's experienced challenges during their own pregnancy or the
3192320	3197520	pregnancy of a loved one. You can skip ahead to the time below if this is a sensitive topic for you.
3197600	3202000	Katie Seagal's departure to have her first child took an unfortunate turn. She was six weeks from
3202000	3207040	coming to term when she had to have an emergency caesarean section, and tragically her pregnancy
3207040	3212240	ended in a stillbirth. Normally this type of information would stay private, as it so obviously
3212240	3216800	should, but Seagal had been public with her pregnancy. To prevent the difficulty of dealing
3216800	3220400	with questions from a nosy press, she released a statement on what had happened.
3227520	3244960	Somehow Seagal was able to return to the show less than a month after the experience,
3244960	3248880	and the pregnancy was quickly written out of the series, with the early episodes revealed to be a
3248880	3253600	dream Al was having. Naturally, there needed to be a moment where Al is shocked to learn that Peg
3253600	3272560	is no longer pregnant. The kids are awkwardly roped into this scene for this moment because,
3272560	3277040	and this is me speculating, no one wanted to put Katie Seagal in a scene where she even had to
3277040	3282400	hear references to a missing pregnancy. I think this shows how, behind the scenes, the cast and
3282400	3286880	crew unmarried with children had a lot of real love and affection for one another, especially
3286880	3291600	in a difficult time like this. Katie Seagal would become pregnant two more times during the run of
3291600	3296400	the series, and happily both were delivered to term successfully. For obvious reasons, her second
3296400	3300400	and third pregnancies are never referenced on the show. While Katie Seagal was away from the show,
3300400	3305200	there was another important moment for the series. Mende Burce, who played Marcy, decided to try her
3305200	3310720	hand at directing in the episode titled, If I Could See Me Now, in which Al needs glasses.
3310800	3314640	Although she would still appear as Marcy until the end of the series, she would go on to direct
3314640	3319920	over 30 episodes of Married with Children. Season 6 also gave us the birth of a new
3319920	3325760	gimmick Bud would use to attract women. When the hat is on, I'm street rapper Grandmaster B.
3327760	3335920	When it's off, I'm Bud. Got it? Now, the hat is on. Who am I?
3335920	3340640	Oh, cheer up, Buttwagger B. Why, it's Grandfather B.
3340640	3345840	They're there, Crossdresser B. I'm really sorry, Grand Marshal B.
3345840	3349200	Gasp, passer, bassmaster. What's the difference?
3349200	3352880	Even after the first 10 episodes of the season are revealed to have been a dream,
3352880	3356640	as a convenient way of writing Peg and Marcy's pregnancies out of the show,
3356640	3362320	the Grandmaster B persona manages to survive. Do you also call yourself street rapper Grandmaster B?
3362320	3365360	Or was that a dream? Oh, come on, Daddy.
3365360	3368400	Even Bud's not pathetic enough to- Hey, this is a Grandmaster B.
3370160	3373680	Chicks would be all over me. I could wear my hat backwards.
3374640	3376560	Oh man, I'm gonna go write my first rap right now.
3377440	3382240	This gimmick was inspired by real life, where David Fosino was trying to be a rapper
3382240	3389120	under the name Dee Lil. Fosino released an album titled Ballistics, which spawned one single titled
3389120	3393920	I Told Ya. I couldn't find any sales information for this album, but since there was no follow-up,
3393920	3399040	I assume it wasn't quite as popular as the Joey Lawrence album from the same time period.
3399040	3402800	I don't want to get any copyright claims for playing some of Dee Lil's single,
3402800	3405760	so I'm gonna rap a few bars for you. Here we go.
3407200	3410160	So you wick-wack, knick-knack, tick-tack, skip back.
3410160	3412960	I got the funky style and you know you can't get with that.
3412960	3415600	I got more flavor than the bar candy kit, cat.
3415600	3418480	And when it comes to kitty cats, I gotta have the Jimmy hats.
3420000	3421680	Yeah, that was the song.
3422720	3427680	Season 6 also brought us the first return of Steve Rhodes in The Egg and Eye.
3427680	3430000	In this episode, Steve has stolen a rare hawk egg,
3430000	3433840	but when he comes back for Marcy, he finds out she's moved on.
3433840	3435680	I came to reclaim my wife.
3436720	3441840	I wouldn't crawl to you if I had a date with Mel Gibson and you had the last diaphragm on Earth.
3441840	3448480	Because we had one, two, three, four, five, seven kids.
3449680	3453680	Season 7 is often cited as the season where everything started to take a bad turn.
3453680	3457280	It was during the season that one of the show's co-creators, Michael Moy,
3457280	3460880	left the series, leaving Ron leave it to hold it together on his own.
3460880	3464400	This season also had the Bundy clan receive a new addition,
3464400	3467040	Seven, played by Shane Sweet.
3467040	3470480	Adding a cute kid to the cast has been a gimmick on TV sitcoms for decades,
3470560	3474800	and I can't think of a single time where it worked, at least in the long term.
3474800	3477440	Seven, the son of Peggy's hillbilly cousins,
3477440	3481600	is abandoned to the Bundy family because, as bad as life is for the Bundy's,
3481600	3485920	Peggy's side of the family, the wankers, were in an even worse state.
3485920	3488560	Although Peg would display some surprising maternal instincts,
3488560	3490720	the audience was less keen on Seven.
3490720	3493680	The show tried its best to bring Seven into the fold with the episode,
3493680	3498000	Every Bundy Has a Birthday, where the family goes to the park to celebrate Seven's birthday.
3498000	3501520	Sadly, being poor, they apparently don't get to use the public park.
3511360	3515600	The family bonds the only way they know how, by beating the crap out of another family.
3520640	3522400	There's a lot of ass-kicking in this show.
3522400	3525680	We saw a similar fight in the season 5 opener, We'll Follow the Sun.
3528640	3529680	Honey?
3529680	3532880	Jerry, don't you have anything better to do than to pick a fight with a moron?
3536240	3538320	Just who are you calling moron?
3538320	3539440	Your husband.
3539440	3540640	You painted hus-
3543120	3544960	And countless other episodes.
3546080	3549440	Sadly for Seven, even this show of family solidarity wasn't enough,
3549440	3551920	and he'd leave the cast before the end of the season.
3551920	3554960	He mysteriously vanished in the episode, Peggy and the Pirates,
3554960	3557520	where Peggy tells him a thrilling story about pirates,
3557520	3559840	including another guest appearance by David Garrison.
3559840	3563680	This was a really fun episode, we get to see Peg fall for Pirate Owl,
3563680	3568080	Peg gets to be a bit of a badass, and all sorts of fun pirate capers.
3579120	3584240	Peg finishes her story, and she's shoes Seven away, and we never see him again.
3584320	3587280	But we do get a very tiny Seven cameo in season 8,
3587280	3588080	kinda.
3588080	3591120	And before we leave season 7, in this episode titled Christmas,
3591120	3593360	we get a flashback of a very young Buck.
3598400	3600960	There's no commentary here, I just wanted to show you Puppy Buck.
3606080	3611280	Behind the scenes, in late 1993, Amanda Burz's sexuality jumped into the headlines when she
3611280	3613760	finally went public with the fact that she was gay.
3614240	3634240	At the time, Burz was the only network star who was out,
3634240	3638400	and this happened four years before Ellen DeGeneres would come out in 1997.
3638400	3642240	I suspect the low opinion critics had of Married with Children may have colored
3642240	3645200	their reactions to this moment, garnering less publicity.
3645200	3648640	As for representations of gay characters on the show, Married with Children had one
3648640	3653520	episode featuring a gay character back in season 5 in the episode titled The Dance Show.
3653520	3657840	Peggy meets a handsome stranger at a dance club, hoping to trigger some of Al's jealousy.
3657840	3661600	It doesn't really work, and Al sits at home unbothered and happy,
3661600	3665760	until Peggy's dancing partner's husband comes knocking at the door.
3672960	3680000	First off, yes, that is Dan Castellaneta, the voice of Homer Simpson, playing Pete.
3680000	3684080	And yes, he did say husband, even though gay marriage was still decades away.
3684080	3688000	That, in and of itself, is a powerful statement about gay relationships.
3688000	3692240	But I want to focus on Al's reactions to this. This moment could have gone so many ways,
3692240	3696240	and of course we begin with Al being very confused. But as he gets to know Pete,
3696240	3697760	we see a surprising reaction.
3702240	3730480	Al, motivated by Pete's cooking, storms off to the dance club and confronts Pete's husband.
3730480	3732960	Not because Peggy's scheme to make him jealous has worked,
3732960	3735920	but because he's fighting for this gay marriage to stay together.
3755120	3760320	So we have Al Bundy, a man who hates his own marriage and will help tear down anyone else's,
3760320	3764480	standing up to protect a gay marriage. There's something powerful about that,
3764480	3769440	and surprisingly socially progressive. The show does end on a sour note though.
3783040	3787520	When it comes to sexism and misogyny, the show was not quite so enlightened.
3787600	3792320	Season 8 brought us one of the most popular and one of the most problematic elements of the show,
3792320	3799360	the anti-feminist group named National Organization of Men Against Amazonian Masterhood, or
3800080	3805840	No-Mam. They debuted in an episode appropriately titled No-Mam. In this episode, Al and his buddies
3805840	3810160	are dismayed to find out that their regular bowling night has been replaced by a women's only night
3810160	3815040	thanks to the efforts of Jerry Springer. Al's reaction is less than in light.
3817520	3833920	This is indicative of a lot of small cracks Al makes when he feels threatened or challenged.
3833920	3838400	It's a low-key homophobia that undoes a lot of the positive stuff we see in episodes like
3838400	3842720	the dance show. Eventually, Al and his buddies try to ease their pain by going to their favorite
3842720	3847360	strip club, which they lovingly refer to as the Nudie Bar. When they get there though,
3847360	3852880	it's been turned into a woman's coffee house. So Al does what any man upset with losing a place
3852880	3863920	to hang out on a Thursday night would do. He forms an activist group. Eventually,
3863920	3866640	Marcy docks his Al and they get into a YouTube debate.
3877040	3881280	What's really interesting here is hearing the audience take sides when Marcy and Al's debate
3881280	3882480	reaches a crescendo.
3893920	3908720	The episode ends with Al being arrested, because he's a loser and will always lose.
3908720	3912800	But what happened here was a major meeting between the audience's love for Al and the
3912800	3917680	reactionary conservative worldview he represents. We've spent so long sympathizing with Al,
3917680	3921920	including forgiving the theft in line, so why not cheer on his anti-woman group?
3921920	3926480	Even taken most generously, Al is arguing against the idea that women are trying to
3926480	3931840	take over the world to subjugate men. But his evidence is pretty thin. He lost one night of
3931840	3936240	the week to bull, and his strip club is turned into a coffee shop. The latter seems more a
3936240	3940320	product of capitalism wanting to appeal to a market outside of horny men. It's not much of
3940320	3945440	a global feminist takeover. If this was a one-off episode, it'd be fine, but we're going to see
3945440	3949440	more of No Mem in the future. It was a huge hit with the audience married of children had
3949440	3953680	cultivated, one that saw Al as more of a hero to be cheered than a loser to be laughed at.
3958320	3961440	A major change for this season was the introduction of Al's co-worker,
3961440	3966240	Griff, played by Harold Sylvester. Season 8 had tried and failed to give Al a co-worker to
3966240	3971520	play off of at the shoe store, first with the much younger Aaron, who lasted about five episodes,
3971520	3976720	and the very short-lived Dexter, who only lasted a single episode. Neither of them had the staving
3976720	3981120	power of Griff, who would never join the principal cast, but would be a recurring character on many
3981120	3985520	episodes for the rest of the series' run. As you might have noticed, he's one of the first major
3985520	3989760	characters to be a person of color. Although technically Officer Dan appeared earlier in the
3989760	3994560	series, he didn't get a name until season 8, and only appeared on roughly a dozen episodes. Griff
3994560	3999120	would appear in over 40. While this might seem like the perfect vehicle to explore race and some
3999120	4003920	issues around that, if you think this has any chance to happening, you've obviously come to the wrong
4003920	4008720	show. Instead, we get a different kind of inclusivity, where Al's diverse group feels distinctly
4008720	4013760	post-racial, something that might have passed for liberalism back in the day. And Griff, like
4013760	4018800	all of Al's friends, becomes a member of Nomam to show a multicultural front against women. And
4018800	4023760	Nomam was out in full force this season, first with a two-parter where they took a stand against
4023760	4028720	breastfeeding in public. This two-parter introduced us to a number of characters that would populate
4028720	4039520	this series' world. First was the Hispanic reporter named, um, yeah, that. And as the only
4039520	4044400	recurring Hispanic character on the show, her being a capable journalist who seems constantly
4044400	4050160	exasperated by the nonsense around her, seems like a nice positive. Although 90% of her character is
4050160	4055200	just her sane, her complicated name. The second half of this two-parter introduced the owner of
4055200	4062080	Al's shoe store, Gary, who, shockingly, is not a man. And we see Al do the unthinkable,
4062080	4076000	grovel to a woman. This expanding world, with more guys joining Al's anti-woman group,
4076000	4081040	like Bob Rooney and Ike, are being offset by female characters who think they're a bunch of
4081040	4087680	idiots. The lines are being drawn in this world. At the time, Nomam was so popular that E.E. Bell,
4087680	4092640	the actor who played Bob Rooney, started a website that would let fans across the country register
4092640	4098480	their own Nomam groups. You write into me, tell me who your head honcho is, and who the other
4098480	4104080	guys in your branch are, and I'll list them on a webpage. And that lasted about a year and a half
4104640	4109760	until I got to where it was like two hours a night for me to just do the emails on this,
4110560	4114320	although Nomam mania was taking off, serious co-creator Michael Moy,
4114320	4117840	who returned to the show this season, wasn't too bothered by what that might mean.
4130800	4135440	Moy even pitched a Nomam spinoff, though network executives balked at the idea of giving this
4135440	4139600	group of characters a show of their own and didn't get nearly as far as other failed spinoff
4139600	4144480	attempts. Speaking of failed spinoffs, this season featured another one, this one titled
4144480	4148720	Radio Free Tremaine, which tried to get a show about a college radio station off the ground.
4148720	4153200	It was notable for two things. The first, that it featured the return of David Garrison, once again
4153200	4157840	playing Steve Rhodes. And second, in that it featured a very young Carrie Russell before she
4157840	4163040	would star in Felicity. This spinoff never even got the courtesy of a six-episode run.
4163120	4167280	It was dead with the pilot. This will be David Garrison's last appearance on the series,
4167280	4170720	though I prefer to remember him from his appearance a few episodes earlier in
4170720	4178960	Get the Dodge Outta Hell, where he got one of the longest ovations in the series' history.
4193040	4200640	Ron Leavitt, Siri's co-creator, left Married with Children for good after the ninth season.
4200640	4205520	He would move over to the WB, where he would help put together a Married with Children-esque sitcom
4205520	4211280	named Unhappily Ever After. A modest success, reaching 100 episodes, but it was fittingly
4211280	4215120	called a Married with Children ripoff. Without a doubt, the most difficult
4215120	4221040	change in season 10 was one surrounding, beloved family dog, Buck. We could see Buck getting older
4221040	4225520	in previous seasons as he was slowly going blind and suffering some cognitive delay.
4225520	4231360	I've got to prove to him that I'm not senile. I know. I'll bury a bone. That'll show him.
4232400	4234560	Now, if I can just find a bone...
4239920	4240880	Excuse me, madam.
4241600	4247680	In season 10, this all came to a head in the tragically titled, Requiem for a Dead Briard.
4247680	4253440	The episode opens with us learning that Buck has passed away. Luckily, this is merely Buck,
4253440	4258400	the TV character, not the real dog, who got to appear in this episode where he goes to heaven.
4258400	4263520	But this dog won't be going to heaven. He instead gets reincarnated as a puppy named Lucky.
4263520	4266320	And this dog's family is... well...
4267360	4273120	Those voices sound oddly familiar. If I could just get these newborn eyes to focus...
4273760	4275440	I'm your baby.
4277280	4280400	Noooooo!
4280400	4284640	This episode isn't much, but it ends on a sweet note from the producers wishing the dog who played
4284640	4290320	Buck, also named Buck, the best of luck in his retirement. According to show co-creator Michael
4290320	4294960	Moy, there was some concern over Buck as he was already 12 years old and was experiencing pain
4294960	4298960	having to go up and down the stairs, so they thought it best that he be set free to enjoy
4298960	4305040	some much deserved rest. Later interviews with Buck reveal a possible sore point between him
4305040	4309600	and Lucky. I have nothing to say about Lucky. Buck's replacement Lucky would continue to be
4309600	4314480	voiced by Kevin Carran throughout the season, though by the 11th the internal monologues would
4314480	4320400	be dropped entirely. As for Buck, sadly he would pass away a week after the 10th season ended,
4320400	4324960	hopefully in a happy place, and he will be fondly remembered as a very good boy.
4325760	4330640	Married with Children was a trailblazer that included a few instances of trans representation.
4330640	4335600	Although a smaller role in season 9's Dud Bowl, we met the quarterback from Al's high school
4335600	4340240	football team. We get the obligatory shocked moment from her former teammates, including a
4340240	4345600	very creepy move by Al. But generally the characters are pretty cool with it, particularly Peggy and
4345600	4352320	Marcy. And what's she doing here? I am here in support of my sister in arms, Dad. I hope that
4352400	4357520	she wins and somehow you don't. Dad is able to take her old position of quarterback and is
4357520	4361200	generally welcomed on the team. She not only gets to throw what would have been the winning
4361200	4366240	touchdown, had Al not messed it up, but she even gets to punch out a transphobe. I'm sad.
4369360	4370480	I'm Thor.
4374880	4378880	Still got your arm, Dad? You make the call.
4382720	4389840	This was fairly ahead of the curve for 1994. Season 10 gave us another trans character.
4389840	4393840	Once again a trans woman, but this time instead of a cis man wearing a wig,
4393840	4398800	this character was played by a cis female, Krista Allen. She's a student at Bud's college,
4398800	4403280	who he's trying to convince to pose for a pin-up calendar. We don't find out the truth about her
4403280	4408640	until the end. It's time for my family and the rest of the world to see the person I've become.
4409600	4414480	Bud Bundy has made me proud to be a woman who was born a man.
4416880	4420720	Although we only ever find out this character is trans at the very end, as a punchline,
4420720	4424800	what's interesting is how the show handles it. This could have led to some transphobic commentary,
4424800	4430640	but instead we get silence. The message here is pretty clear that society isn't ready for a trans
4430640	4436000	woman and the shock is overwhelming for these average cis men. Is it overtly transphobic though?
4436000	4440720	This episode firmly establishes that sexual attraction is entirely possible between cis
4440720	4445520	and trans people if only cis characters were going to ignore their prejudices. It also,
4445520	4449920	at the very least, makes trans people visible, not pretending they don't exist.
4449920	4455200	But the unspoken side of things does highlight the dark side of trans acceptance in the mid-90s.
4455200	4460880	It couldn't be overtly protrans, and in that silence basic anti-trans assumptions reign supreme.
4460880	4465600	Calendars fail, the guys are grossed out, and Bud is embarrassed, having made out with a trans
4465600	4471200	woman. It makes my evaluation of, it could have been worse, seem a bit tepid. Also though we did
4471200	4476000	get two trans women characters in Married with Children, I didn't see any trans men, a group
4476000	4480480	that suffered greatly from a lack of visibility, and that's still a problem we deal with today.
4480480	4485520	The last note I have on season 10 is the final attempt at a spin-off for the series, this time
4485520	4490560	Enemies, a rough parody of Friends, starring Nicole Eggert and Matt Borlangi.
4490560	4494400	It wasn't very good, aside from watching the Darcy's try to speak to a black person.
4516240	4519840	Yeah, but he's not here, so it's a no, Bundy!
4521120	4525280	Final season of the show ended things more on a whimper than a bang. Both of the show's creators
4525280	4529600	had left at this point, and Fox showed a lack of care for the health of the series by moving its
4529600	4534720	time slot several times throughout the season. A devastating move in an era when time slots created
4534720	4538960	predictability for an audience so they could manage their time in a way that let them watch
4538960	4543840	their favorite shows. Ratings started to drop dramatically, and rising production costs meant
4543840	4548480	this season would be the show's last. Not that anyone involved with the production had any idea.
4548480	4552960	With the series' creators both gone, Married with Children was without either of the voices
4552960	4558480	that had guided it through the previous seasons. Al and Peg, who for the first time in 11 seasons
4558480	4564480	break things off in a three-parter titled Breaking Up is Easy to Do. In it, a typical marital spat
4564480	4569920	where Al reveals that he's forgotten the first time he and Peg had sex eventually leads to disaster.
4569920	4575680	It sure is. I'm moving out, Peg. And much like that empty promise to shave those shoulders,
4575680	4581120	I'll believe it when I see it. You'll be wishing you had these shaggy shoulders to cry on Peg.
4582160	4585360	We then see Al and Peg try to enjoy their lives as single people.
4590240	4594960	Al eventually tries to win back Peg from her new boyfriend, Bruce, played by Alan Thicke.
4595680	4599360	Gee, Peg, you really have a new boyfriend.
4601280	4606160	Well, this is an awkward moment. Fortunately, I'm so self-centered it's not going to bother me.
4608160	4611760	When the kids find out their new stepdad expects them to get jobs,
4611760	4614160	they use some Bundy Cell rhetoric to get rid of him.
4614160	4622400	And eventually, Al and Peg patch things up.
4623280	4628960	A surprisingly sweet episode, at least for any other season, but season 11 was unusually sweet
4628960	4633520	overall. Maybe it was the show's creators being gone for good, but the show definitely felt like
4633520	4638640	it lost much of its cynical edge at this point. While no one wants to see Al and Peg split up,
4638640	4642720	the way they got back together seemed almost muddlin'. It could have worked in any other
4642720	4647920	season, but this one was already so filled with sentimental moments that it just got lost in a
4647920	4652880	sea of sappiness. At least, by Married with Children standards. The last two-parter of the
4652880	4657840	series, often mistakenly thought of as the finale, features Kelly falling in love with a rich man,
4657840	4663520	Lonnie, played by Charles Esten. They meet when Lonnie's soon-to-be ex takes the Bundy family
4663520	4674400	hostage. Lonnie very quickly proposes.
4693520	4704160	Kelly soon gives up her promiscuous ways. But Al learns that Lonnie doesn't respect
4704160	4716400	Kelly after seeing him at the nudie bar. But eventually, Lonnie makes a move on
4716400	4721280	Marcy and everything begins to crumble.
4746400	4753760	This would have been a fitting finale. The institution of marriage is upheld as requiring
4753760	4759360	love and not being an expression of temporary lust. We get some Bund unity and some commentary
4759360	4764720	on the rich seeing people as disposable commodities, even husbands and wives. While the poor stay
4764720	4768800	together because they need one another to get through tough times. Marriage is something you
4768800	4773280	should only do if you can withstand the challenge. Not a bad sentiment, but some marriages should end
4773360	4777440	and the fact that poor people have to cling together to withstand those bad times, as seen
4777440	4781520	in the many ways the Bundies band together to fight outside threats, keeps these toxic
4781520	4787120	relationships going. Or more accurately, makes these loving relationships toxic. When you're in
4787120	4791600	a loving unit, embattled by the harsh world around you, it's hard not to let some of that harsh world
4791600	4795840	seep inside yourself and affect the people around you. It would have been a decent enough ending,
4795840	4800960	but there would be one more episode for the series. A forgettable caper involving Al bartering shoes.
4800960	4812080	All of the episode did end on a pretty cool final scene.
4825600	4827760	Married with Children came to an end.
4828400	4831200	Someone else heard it on the radio and then called me
4831760	4838320	to tell me that the show was canceled. I'm like wow 11 years and I find out from Mark and Brian
4838320	4842560	that's that's a trip. I was in Ohio at a bed and breakfast and a honeymoon couple
4843200	4846800	approached me in the parking lot as I was getting in my car and said, I'm sorry Dr. Shaw.
4847920	4855280	I said really? Oh you didn't know it's on fee it was canceled. So I said oh really? So I took
4855280	4859520	you got married. I took him in the bottom and drank a little champagne. I said I prefer to
4859520	4866480	hear it from you. You think a show that ran as long as it did that had the impact that it had
4866480	4871200	on launching a network might have been sent off with a little more hurrah but you know
4871200	4877040	business is business. So we never got a final episode which I thought was extremely unfair
4877040	4881920	seeing as we were one of the first shows there. I mean we were at the network before the Simpsons
4881920	4886480	were there. Although we never got a final episode the cast did share a few of their ideas of how it
4886480	4894880	all should have ended. I'd like to see everybody blown up. Al wins the lottery and uh for like
4895440	4900480	20 million you pick a number and they're dancing around in the living room and like a tornado
4900480	4905680	comes in like like the Wizard of Oz you know and then all that's left is a big hole. And the house
4905680	4911200	comes back down on you know Marcy's body and you just see her little feet coming out. Whatever would
4911200	4917440	happen Jefferson would end up by himself on an island with a you know a cocktail an umbrella
4917440	4925040	and several bikini-clad women and uh living the good life and the rest of them would be you know
4925040	4930880	hell somewhere. That's one desperate little chimp huh. The through line of the series I found most
4930880	4935200	prominent was the evolution of Al going from the loser the audience laughed at to the loser
4935200	4939680	audience grew to love and support and while Al himself changed very little the audience around
4939760	4944320	him seemed to more closely align with how he saw the world. I don't think married with children
4944320	4948880	mainstreamed reactionary politics though. More likely I think it attracted people already
4948880	4954160	inclined towards them. The serious tact to the very real feelings people had and continue to have.
4954160	4958080	The feelings of people who once felt the world was their birthright suddenly realizing that
4958080	4962080	life isn't going to turn out the way they thought it would. In that way married with children can
4962080	4966320	help contextualize this feeling in a way that perhaps isn't helpful when it's just being mocked.
4966320	4970480	Sure we can laugh at how silly Al and the other Bundys are but can we not want them to do better
4970480	4975040	too and maybe do better in a way that isn't just tearing down the people around them. Maybe it can
4975040	4978720	help motivate us to try and make a better world where people won't feel a connection to families
4978720	4983200	like the Bundys. As much as we like to pretend these bitter feelings of the Bundys don't exist
4983200	4987440	they have a way of encroaching into our lives and that's what this show does so well. It screams at
4987440	4992400	the audience letting us know that these people exist they live amongst us and to some of us it
4992400	4997520	may be downright relatable. And as a small coda to that though there is a wonderful irony in a show
4997520	5001920	giving voice to the voiceless reactionary working-class white man even though there aren't many
5001920	5007280	characters like the Bundys on TV they still got to have a show. Other marginalized groups even some
5007280	5013120	depicted on the show weren't so lucky. I've often heard it said that shows like Married with Children
5013120	5018400	could never be put on the air today because of how politically correct everything is. That's sort of
5018400	5022560	true but the only reason it got on the air in the 80s was because it slipped through the cracks of
5022560	5027760	an upstart network. Married with Children in many ways set the tone for Vox being raunchy and rude
5027760	5032640	it paved the way for future unconventional sitcoms such as The Simpsons and Malcolm in the Middle with
5032640	5037680	their unconventional takes on the family dynamic. The stars of the show mostly had success following
5037680	5042320	the end of the series. Ed O'Neill started a handful of projects and it was at one point nearly cast
5042320	5047360	as Al Swearingen on HBO's Deadwood. Role had actually been written for him by the series creator
5047360	5051920	but apparently his time on Married with Children had too closely associated him with Al Bundy,
5051920	5056880	a running theme over the years in his career. O'Neill did eventually get cast on Modern Family
5056880	5061840	which went on to run for 11 seasons just like Married with Children although Modern Family
5061840	5066880	was a few episodes shorter when it ended in 2020. Also one of my favorite fun facts about Ed O'Neill
5066880	5072320	is his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is in front of a shoe store. Katie Skoll would go on to
5072320	5076480	appear in a number of shows including 8 Simple Rules where she starred opposite John Ritter for
5076480	5081600	3 seasons. She probably had her most lauded performance though as Gemma in Sons of Anarchy
5081600	5087200	which ran for 7 seasons. I'll probably remember her most fondly as the voice of Leela on Futurama.
5107200	5111040	Too bad they weren't giving away the three things you actually need.
5111040	5114240	Mouthwash, a back wax, and stain proof underwear.
5116720	5121520	Christina Applegate was the breakout star after Married with Children ended. She starred in
5121520	5125760	Jesse, Samantha Who, Up All Night, and a number of other roles on TV and film
5125760	5131040	but she never quite landed in a project that made use of her talents. However, she did have one very
5131040	5135760	important triumph. When she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2008 she would undergo a double
5135760	5140720	mastectomy. Quite happily she was able to make a recovery and is currently cancer free. Most
5140720	5146000	recently she's starring in the Netflix series Dead to Me. David Faustino's career post Married with
5146000	5150640	Children has been a bit more low key. Although he did have the singular honor of working alongside
5150640	5158560	John Bon Jovi in 2006's National Lapoons Pucked, he did star in his own original web series Starving
5158560	5162880	which ran for two seasons and featured cameos from Married with Children Castmates.
5162960	5167840	Faustino currently works as a DJ. Amanda Burst would transition into a directorial role
5167840	5172560	only occasionally taking a few small acting jobs. She eventually moved east leaving Hollywood and
5172560	5176640	most of the world of show business behind her. Of all the cast members she seems the least connected
5176640	5180800	to her previous role. David Garrison's return to the world of theater saw him starring in a number
5180800	5185040	of productions though most notably he played the wizard in the Broadway production of Wicked.
5185040	5189520	Though he would often get called back to the world of TV to do a few guest spots under his programs
5189520	5193680	he managed to split his time appearing in a number of different stage productions as well.
5194240	5200000	Burst and Garrison had a very weird cameo together in 2001 on the TV series Nikki. The series starred
5200000	5206000	Nikki Cox who got her first major role on Unhappily Ever After which was created by Married
5206000	5210880	with Children co-creator Ron Levitt. Burst and Garrison reprised the roles as the Rhodeses.
5211920	5216720	Ted McGinley would continue his lengthy career on TV most notably joining a sitcom at the beginning
5216720	5221840	of its run for a change when he starred alongside Faith Ford and Kelly Ripa in Hope and Faith.
5221840	5226720	More recently he seems to have cashed in on the Christian movie circuit appearing in films such as
5226720	5232320	Christmas with a capital C, Do You Believe, and God's Not Dead, A Light in Darkness.
5233200	5238480	The show's co-creator Ron Levitt sadly passed away in 2008 of lung cancer. The last project he
5238480	5244240	worked on was the WB's The Help. He's survived by his two children and his partner who he met while
5244240	5248400	filming Married with Children. Michael Moy, the other co-creator of the show, has largely left
5248400	5252320	the world of show business. He very much felt like the encroachment of political correctness
5252320	5257760	was stifling the brand of comedy he enjoyed so for his own sanity he retired and currently lives
5257760	5265200	happily with his family. You know I can't write a sitcom or any type of comedy if I now have to
5265200	5272480	factor in that this just may offend someone because I've always thought by its very nature
5273440	5279280	comedy has to kind of be slightly offensive. It doesn't have to be mean-spirited. You don't
5279280	5283600	sit there and just tear down someone. Though there have been rumblings about a Married with
5283600	5290400	Children reboot, most notably one rumored in 2016 starring David Faustino, it hasn't quite materialized.
5290400	5294000	From what little I could find about the subject, there seems to be some kind of legal dispute
5294000	5298640	around Ron Levitt's estate preventing it from happening. With much of the cast available,
5298640	5302560	aside from possibly Christina Applegate, it seems like the perfect time for a reunion.
5303120	5307200	So far that just doesn't seem to be in the cards though. Married with Children would live on in
5307200	5311120	the world of syndication for decades but it also found life around the world and the number of
5311120	5315520	international versions of the show. They were married with children remakes from over a dozen
5315520	5320320	countries. The UK version gave us the rare treat of an American show being shipped overseas to be
5320320	5326880	ruined by local TV producers. Here's an excruciating clip. With what I earn, I keep you in bleach,
5326960	5330240	I keep you in binoculars, I keep you instead of someone I'd rather be married to
5331840	5335440	and I pay my national insurance for a nice little pension at the end of it all.
5335440	5339840	At school they said by the time you retire there won't be any state pensions.
5339840	5341520	You're not going to come and live with us are you dad?
5344480	5350880	Did I tell you today that I love you? No. Exactly. So why should I choose to live with you when I can
5350880	5356400	sleep rough and die of exposure? The UK series mercifully only lasted seven episodes. The other
5356400	5361200	versions had varying degrees of success though none did as well as the Russian version which ran
5361200	5368160	for six seasons totaling 365 episodes. The series adapted episodes from the original version of the
5368160	5372400	show but when they ran out they had a contest where fans sent in their own original ideas.
5372400	5376480	They even managed to get a few original episodes from the original writing staff of the American
5376480	5382080	version of Married with Children. Al Bundy will go down in history as an iconic TV character as
5382080	5387120	part of a series that shaped a network and took the sitcom format in a bold new direction.
5387120	5392320	It's a series of its time that's somehow timeless so long as there is an angry man sitting on his
5392320	5398160	couch bitter that the world just isn't what it used to be. Al Bundy will speak to that person.
5398160	5402640	There's one popular clip of the show on YouTube where Al Bundy sums up his life in depressing
5402640	5409200	fashion. It's taken from a season three episode. He thought he could. Every morning when I wake up
5409200	5415760	I know it's not going to get any better until I go back to sleep again. So I get up, have my
5415760	5422480	watered down tang and still frozen pop tart, get in my car with no upholstery no gas and six more
5422480	5428640	payments to fight traffic just for the privilege of putting cheap shoes on the cloven hooves of
5428640	5435840	people like you. I'll never play football like I thought I would. I'll never know the touch of a
5435840	5441200	beautiful woman and I'll never again know the joy of driving without a bag on my head.
5443040	5449680	But I'm not a loser because despite it all, me and every other guy who will never be what he
5449680	5455360	wanted to be are still out there being what we don't want to be 40 hours a week for life.
5456800	5462880	And the fact that I haven't put a gun in my mouth you pudding of a woman makes me a winner.
5466800	5472640	The speech is the moment that takes Al from the loser we laugh at to the loser we cheer for.
5472640	5477440	This sort of speech would fall flat to deaf ears but for one of Al's fellow travelers or one who
5477440	5483280	just admires his gumption it's the bitter scream to the world to remind them that people like Al
5483280	5488880	still exist. They're here and they're daring us with the question what are you gonna do about it?
5488880	5497680	This was by far the largest project I've ever worked on. It is not only the longest script,
5497680	5505200	it is the most content I've ever had to watch for a video. Nearly 260 episodes of television and
5505200	5511280	multiple TV specials, news articles, and all sorts of behind the scenes bits of information that I
5511280	5516320	had to consume for this one. It was made possible by the generous donations of my patrons whose
5516320	5520240	names you can see on the screen now. If you'd like to be one of these fine people you can head
5520240	5526240	over to my patreon and donate. Five dollar tier will also get you a download of my theme song
5526240	5531440	and advance access to future videos like this one. If you'd like to support this channel in a way
5531440	5537920	that doesn't cost you anything you can like, comment, subscribe, and hit the bell. I appreciate
5537920	5543200	anyone who does so has my thanks. Anyone who watches this video has my thanks. Basically just
5543200	5544480	thank you everyone.
