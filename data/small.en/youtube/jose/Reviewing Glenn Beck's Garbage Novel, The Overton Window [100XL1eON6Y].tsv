0	14320	The Overton Window is what happens when you cross a bland political thriller with the
14320	16840	ravings of a conspiracy theorist.
16840	19720	It's cynical, lazy, and a complete waste of time.
19720	21720	It's also a complete grift.
21720	25440	It probably won't convince anyone new with its paranoid premise, but it does comfortably
25440	30480	remind believers that, yes, their country can only be saved by their love of America
30480	32120	and guns.
32120	36280	To understand this book, we have to go back to when it was published, 2010, and remind
36280	40040	ourselves of the phenomena that was Glenn Beck.
40040	42280	Glenn Beck really used to be somebody.
42280	45920	He still technically is, but back then he was a really big deal.
45920	51520	A former radio personality, Glenn Beck's start in the cable TV news world was in 2006
51520	54280	on CNN's Headline News Channel.
54280	59200	By 2008 he had made the jump to Fox News, and within a few years he had become one of
59200	61600	the hottest shows on cable news.
61600	66280	He had several best-selling books to his name, and he was the spiritual leader of the new
66280	68520	Tea Party movement.
68520	72960	Glenn Beck's specialty was reciting facts, drawing lines, connecting them on a chalkboard,
72960	76840	and expressing deep concern that these things might be connected.
76840	81280	Glenn's rants were filled with things the right hates and fears, randomly bundled together
81280	83840	in an hour of rage and tears.
83840	98480	And I do mean literal tears.
98480	102880	And I don't bring this up to mock Glenn, there's actually nothing wrong with a grown man crying.
102880	105780	Instead I'm going to use this to illustrate what he does with these tears.
105780	110760	He sells emotions hard, and his generally pleasant demeanor makes him easy to empathize
110760	111760	with.
111760	116040	And once you start empathizing with this sad crying man, you're ready to turn on those
116040	118280	mean things that made him cry.
118280	120440	And what are those mean things?
120440	122120	This image sums it up nicely.
122120	125280	There's something about the expression on Glenn's face here.
125280	129040	He has pictures of various people underneath the watchful gaze of Chairman Mao, and he
129040	133560	looks at us in confusion-ness if to say, what aren't you people getting about how obvious
133560	134560	this is?
134560	138200	It's something that seems silly if it's just thrown out at you in a random video like
138200	142040	this one, but if you'd just been having a cry with this guy, you'd be far more sympathetic
142040	146680	to this bizarre image and you might actually sit down and listen to his ravines and might
146680	148600	even give it some credence.
148600	151560	He's using those emotions as a way of manipulating you.
151560	157000	He also had this thing where he kept calling everything a Nazi, particularly if they were
157000	186840	working for the Obama administration.
187000	194240	The content of Glenn Beck's rantings, or as much content as could be found, was about
194240	199400	an impending doom brought on by the out-of-control spending of the Obama administration.
199400	203960	The debt would, according to Beck, herald the end of the country and the collapse of
203960	205920	American life as we know it.
205920	209360	So he sounded off every night to his loyal followers, becoming a major figure in the
209360	210800	Tea Party movement.
210800	216400	The Tea Party movement was ostensibly a group of concerned American citizens who were very
216400	221640	much bothered by the increasing debt and out-of-control spending of the US government.
221640	225100	We sometimes forget about the Tea Party, but 10 years ago they were responsible for a major
225100	229120	shift to the right in the Republican Party, a shift that we're still feeling today, a
229120	233440	shift that's included more tax cuts for the wealthy, cuts to welfare programs, and a general
233440	237680	hostility to even the mildest forms of expanding the social safety net.
237680	241840	Glenn Beck was deeply connected to this audience, the same audience that would sneer at the
241840	246040	Republican establishment, ignore the criticisms of the mainstream media, and embraced a conman
246040	249640	posing as an outsider promising to tear down the system.
249640	254100	It would be unfair to say this all started 10 years ago exactly, but in this book, The
254100	258360	Overton Window, we have a wonderful symbol of the right-wing populism that was becoming
258360	262280	more mainstream back in 2010.
262280	266960	This novel takes its title from the concept of the Overton Window, created by Joseph P.
266960	267960	Overton.
267960	272600	The window describes a range of acceptable political thought within society at any given
272600	273600	time.
273600	277840	It's tied along a number of different dimensions, like the scope of left and right-wing politics,
277840	283480	but Glenn Beck prefers its original definition, describing the range of freedom within a society.
283480	288480	This book was preceded by a ridiculous trailer that uses the lines from a Rudyard Kipling
288480	292280	poem titled The Gods of the Copybook Headings.
292280	296960	The poem is referenced several times throughout the novel, and has a degree of thematic resonance
296960	297960	within it.
297960	304400	As surely as fire will burn, the gods of the copybook headings, with terror and slaughter
304400	305400	return.
305400	309000	The Overton Window.
309000	310920	That trailer is just… wow.
310920	313960	I've never seen a book trailer quite like that one.
313960	317400	To be honest though, I don't see many trailers for books at all.
317400	320160	Before we dive into the narrative though, there are two things we need to look at.
320160	321660	First, this cover.
321660	325580	At first glance, the image of the Statue of Liberty looking towards the horizon seems
325580	329640	bland and uninspired, but if we zoom in on the statue's body you can tell it's much
329640	333620	more jacked than the original, and you can even see a bit of a beard as the statue very
333620	336180	politely turns their head back towards us.
336180	340380	For some reason, the Statue of Liberty is a man, and he's holding some kind of weapon,
340380	343540	I think, instead of the usual stone tablets.
343540	346180	This wasn't the only cover that was being considered.
346180	350380	Glenn posted a number of options on his website, and held a poll to pick out the winner.
350380	354940	The cover chosen came in fourth… out of four.
354940	358500	Inside the book itself, we get a little note from the author before the narrative starts,
358500	362500	and oh boy, does the opening paragraphs at the stage for what's wrong with this book.
362500	365340	I'm going to channel my inner Glenn Beck here.
365340	368380	I've been a fan of thrillers for many years.
368380	373500	While non-fiction books aim to enlighten the goal of most thrillers is to entertain.
373500	377800	But there is a category of novels that do both… faction.
377800	381960	Completely fictional books with plots rooted in fact, and that is the category I strive
381960	384600	for with the Overton Window.
384600	389400	Okay, so first off, novels have been more than entertainment since they were created,
389400	392920	and second of all, we've had novels set in the real world plenty of times.
392920	397080	I'm not sure why Glenn feels the need to invent a new word here, but let's stop to
397080	399600	appreciate the one he came up with.
399600	400600	Faction?
400600	406680	First of all, faction is already a word, but I'm pretty sure he wants it pronounced FACT-tion.
406680	410920	This invented word does not bode well for the rest of this book.
410920	413920	The rest of the note reads like classic Glenn Beck paranoia.
413920	418480	He expertly gets so close to the line of outright proclaiming there's a conspiracy afoot,
418480	421520	and then immediately walks it back, winking over his shoulder.
421520	423520	Here's a prime example.
423520	428680	But while many of the facts embedded in the plot are true, see the afterword for details,
428680	432280	the scenarios I create as a result of those facts, along with the way things are tied
432280	436040	together and the conclusions that are drawn, are entirely fictional.
436040	439320	Let's hope they stay that way.
439320	442800	Glenn lets us know that this book is complete fiction, and that he's just tried to warn
442800	447360	us of something that is definitely not real, but it could be.
447360	451620	And people say he's crazy for saying this could be true, and he's not saying that,
451620	453120	but it could be.
453120	455280	And I hope you can all see how this little game works.
455280	458720	Get as close to the ridiculous line as you can, and you'll attract an audience willing
458720	464280	to take that extra step in their minds, leaving you ostensibly blameless.
464280	467000	Now let's dive into the story itself.
467000	471920	Noah is a 28-year-old VP in a PR firm run by his father, Arthur.
471920	473480	Here's how the book describes Noah.
473480	478960	Good looking, great job, fine education, puckishly amusing, and even clever when he put his mind
478960	479960	to it.
479960	484720	Reasonably fit and trim for an office jockey, Noah had all the bona fide credentials for
484720	486720	a killer e-harmony profile.
486720	489040	Who could resist?
489040	490440	Well I'll tell you who.
490440	495040	The new girl working in the mail room who catches Noah's eye, a southern woman named
495040	496560	Molly Ross.
496560	500040	You can tell she's one of the book's heroes because, like only the most virtuous
500040	504840	women in their 20s, she's hanging up flyers for her American Patriots group meeting for
504840	505840	that evening.
505840	511880	They call themselves, and I wish I was making this up, the Founders Keepers.
511880	517760	Thankfully, the opposition isn't called something even stupider like Losers Reapers.
517760	520240	Molly toys with Noah in exchanges like this one.
520240	524240	For context, Noah has just said he'd be headed for the meeting Molly was posting flyers
524240	525480	for.
525480	527560	That reminds me of the joke, Molly said.
527560	530720	Noah comes home, Noah from the Bible, you know?
530720	531720	He nodded.
531720	535480	So Noah comes home after he finally got all the animals into the ark and his wife asks
535480	537040	him what he's been doing all week.
537040	539240	Do you know what he said to her?
539240	541120	No, tell me.
541120	545000	Molly patted him on the cheek, pulled his face a little closer.
545000	549440	He said, honey, now I heard everything.
549440	551840	This is how the whole book is written.
551840	556760	So Molly is a tough woman, not easily charmed by Noah, which is really easy to believe because
556760	559760	Noah is completely lacking in charm.
559760	563840	Next we meet Arthur, Noah's father and head of Doyle and Merchant.
563840	567960	Arthur is a cold man, and he has a very low opinion of most people, especially compared
567960	568960	to him.
568960	574960	In the chapter we meet him, he gives us the first of what will be several long, dull monologues.
574960	578440	This won't be a surprise to anyone who's familiar with the show Glenn Beck used to
578440	579920	have on Fox News.
579920	585040	Glenn had a tendency to go on these long, droning sermons, and when characters like
585040	589440	Arthur in this chapter go on one, you can't help but hear Glenn Beck's voice come through
589440	591360	every painful beat.
591360	596520	I'll spare you the ten pages of ranting this guy goes on for and cut to the heart of it.
596520	601520	Arthur's rant is largely just him explaining how the government is completely corrupt and
601520	606160	that it needs to take control of the people, to usher them into a new age where they are
606160	608880	safely under the thumb of the elites.
608880	613280	That's basically everything Glenn imagines someone like Barack Obama is saying behind
613280	614280	closed doors.
614280	618560	The United States government has approached Arthur and his company for public relations
618560	622480	help for a recent document that got leaked, listing various groups the government has
622480	623760	under surveillance.
623760	628040	The document is a list of conspiracy theorists, extreme conservative activists, and other
628040	632160	names assigned to members of Glenn Beck's audience, along with a few outliers to make
632160	633440	it seem legitimate.
633440	637640	By placing his audience in the crosshairs, this is how Glenn Beck breeds loyalty.
637640	642520	He's inventing a threat, using the supposed language of the dark left-wing establishment
642520	646520	and telling his audience that they're being targeted with said words.
646520	650720	Arthur eventually convinces the government that they should let him take the reins of
650720	654480	their messaging because a grand opportunity is afoot.
654480	660560	Now, Arthur Gardner said, his voice just above a whisper, while the tide is in our favor,
660560	661560	come with me.
661560	665680	You can still save yourselves, and in doing so, you can help us build a whole new world
665680	668680	upon the ashes of the old.
668680	672120	Noah heads over to the tavern Molly and her Patriot friends are all hanging out in.
672120	675680	He obviously just wants to see Molly, though, because he's way into her.
675680	680280	While on the way, Noah's out-of-control cab driver gets stopped by security forces, who
680280	683080	are out in numbers because of the G20 summit happening.
683080	687040	It's weird that this G20 plot point is brought up and never mentioned again, but it does
687040	691600	give Noah the chance to use the sovereign citizen defense of, am I being detained?
691600	693960	Which somehow totally works.
693960	698120	His cab driver is less lucky, as he gets hauled away by cops.
698120	699440	The rise met.
699440	700560	Noah and that driver.
700560	705120	What he was yelling now wasn't hard to understand, probably words he'd practiced from a phrasebook
705120	709000	for some bad night that might come along when he'd need them.
709000	711040	Help me, my friend.
711040	715400	I have to offer partial credit to Glenn here for portraying this guy in a sympathetic light.
715400	719120	He's clearly the victim, and if anything, Noah comes off as an asshole, shrugging it
719120	721120	off and getting on with his evening.
721120	723200	So there's some genuine sympathy here.
723200	728480	Not enough to give this cab driver a name, background, or even closure since we never
728480	729560	see him again.
729560	733840	Also him mouthing those words, which for some reason aren't in quotation marks, are, as
733840	738240	best I can tell, the only lines that were spoken by a person of color in this entire
738240	739240	book.
739240	743320	At least, the only character who is explicitly not white.
743320	747200	Noah shrugs off the police state's shakedown and finally gets to the tavern to meet the
747200	748920	founder's keepers.
748920	752600	The crowd here are obviously meant to be stand-ins for the Tea Party movement, and it's cute
752600	755380	how Glenn describes them like this.
755380	757880	The diversity of the gathering was another surprise.
757880	762120	There seemed to be no clear exclusions based on race or class or any of the other traditional
762120	765080	media-fed American cultural divides.
765080	770040	It was a total cross-section, a mix of everyone, three-piece suits rubbing elbows with t-shirts
770040	775440	and sweatpants, yuppies chatting with hippies, black and white, young and old, a cowboy hat
775440	781280	here, a $600 haircut there, all talking together, energetically agreeing and disagreeing as
781280	782760	he moved through them.
782760	786680	In the press, these sorts of meanings were typically depicted as the exclusive haunts
786680	791000	of old white people of limited beings and even more limited intelligence.
791000	793440	But this was everybody.
793440	799360	This gathering of definitely not just white people reads as deeply insecure from the outside.
799360	803040	But for anyone within the Tea Party movement, scenes like this must come across as sweet
803040	804200	vindication.
804200	808600	And even though Glenn claims this patriot gathering in his book is diverse, every character
808600	812520	we meet who has any lines to speak will be white.
812520	817760	Like Molly's friend Hollis, who is big and, uh, nice, I guess?
817760	820520	There's really not a lot to say about this guy.
820520	824200	And what would this gathering be without a few more Glenn Beck rants?
824200	828240	A pair of them this time lasting eight and four pages, respectively.
828240	834000	And it's here it starts to sink in that everyone basically agrees about how the world works.
834000	838040	Even though the Founders' Keeper speakers are foils to Arthur Gardner, the content of
838040	843600	their speeches talk about the same things, the impending disaster, the corruption right
843600	847320	through the government, and how the elites are pulling all the strings.
847320	852320	All these rants toss out facts, draw lazy connections, and everyone just nods along.
852320	855440	There's no real debate or questioning of anything in this book.
855440	857280	Everyone believes in the conspiracy.
857280	861480	It's just a question of whether they support it or fight against it.
861480	865920	The first of the two speakers is Beverly Emerson, Molly's mother.
865920	870360	She manages to cite Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. without ever mentioning race.
870360	874500	She also holds up a constitution and does what a lot of this book will do, present this
874500	876920	document as a sacred text.
876920	880640	She talks about the founding fathers less like men and more like prophets.
880640	885080	The book is dripping with sanctification of the United States' founding.
885080	887920	The next speech comes from a guy named Danny Bailey.
887920	893560	His speech is lots of random facts, once again tenuously connected by arbitrary threads.
893920	897840	Danny is presented as less credible than the other speakers, and perhaps more of a rabble
897840	898840	rouser.
898840	903420	He's someone who got famous through a viral YouTube video, and he acts like an egotistical
903420	904420	rock star.
904420	907880	He seems like an obvious analog for Glenn Beck himself.
907880	912160	Noah scoffs at Danny's speech and gets instantly put on the spot, and then he goes into a rant
912160	916120	of his own where, instead of presenting a different take on the fear-mongering and wild
916120	920160	conspiracy theories being presented, he just agrees with them.
920200	924720	This is all part of Noah's three-page rant, which is only interrupted when a gunshot goes
924720	927120	off and the tavern is swarmed by police.
927120	930520	Noah is arrested along with everyone else, but is eventually released because he's a
930520	932120	rich guy with connections.
932120	935280	Noah uses his connections to get the other Founders' Keeper's members released from
935280	939280	prison, and he takes Molly and her mom to their respective homes in his limo.
939280	943360	Molly's mom gets dropped off pretty quickly, so Noah and Molly can have a sort of date
943360	945840	as he drives her around New York City.
945840	950640	The limo ride is supposedly about Noah and Molly getting closer, but we instead get more
950640	957080	long rants, highlighting, among many other things, how Bill Clinton was utterly ruthless.
957080	961640	Somehow this rant about Bill Clinton charms Molly, and after a kiss, she follows Noah
961640	963060	back to his apartment.
963060	968100	The dialogue makes a shift from long-winded rants to painful banter between Noah and Molly.
968100	971840	She lets him know she isn't going to have sex with him, and bonus points for Noah actually
971840	975960	respecting her need to consent, especially since the scene ends with the two of them
975960	976960	in bed together.
976960	981320	If you thought a woman crawling into bed with a man and wrapping her arm around him would
981320	986280	lead to a hookup, you'd be wrong, because this book is very squeamish about depicting
986280	987280	sex.
987280	991360	But maybe Molly realized she could never have sex with a man who says something like this.
991360	995520	I'm telling you right now, you made the rules, but you're playing with fire here.
995520	1001520	I've got some rules too, and rule number one is, don't tease the panther.
1001520	1005280	Who could possibly have sex with someone after they've said that?
1005280	1009480	Elsewhere, Danny Bailey is approached by another major character for this book's plot, an
1009480	1012760	FBI agent named Stuart Kearns.
1012760	1016840	Kearns picks up Danny from the police station, taking Danny into his custody.
1016840	1021520	Kearns has been working in deep cover for over a decade, posing as an online conspiracy
1021520	1022520	theorist.
1022520	1026680	His mission is to make people who question the government look like ridiculous paranoid
1026680	1027680	weirdos.
1027680	1032440	He's more or less embodying the real-world conspiracy theories that Alex Jones is a government
1032440	1039040	plant designed to undercut other supposedly credible conspiracy theory movements.
1039040	1043080	Kearns recruits an unwilling Danny with threats of jail time.
1043080	1047480	He's using Danny, an activist with a degree of credibility and fame thanks to his YouTube
1047480	1053320	viral video, to further the FBI's agenda to discredit right-wing activist groups.
1053320	1055480	More on how this plot thread plays out later.
1055480	1059560	The next morning, Molly starts to pressure Noah to break into his father's office to
1059560	1061080	steal some documents.
1061080	1064780	These documents are related to the meeting mentioned earlier where Arthur went on that
1064780	1070360	Glenn Beck grant for 10 pages, the meeting about the leaked document that Arthur's firm
1070360	1072200	was hired to cover up.
1072200	1075520	Noah refuses to do it, and then Molly drops this on him.
1075520	1077180	Do you want me to leave?
1077180	1080160	Her voice was tight, and there were sudden tears in her eyes.
1080160	1082360	Do you never want to see me again?
1082360	1084120	Because that's what this means.
1084120	1088040	The book is helpfully establishing that Molly is also an awful person.
1088040	1093240	Noah and Molly break into the office by using the very clever covert method of Noah using
1093240	1098160	his keycard to walk in, and suddenly the conspiracy everyone already believed in is revealed
1098160	1100200	via some PowerPoint slides.
1100200	1104560	The grand plan is to trigger a catastrophic event that will shift the Overton window in
1104560	1109120	the direction towards creating more government oversight, taking away people's freedom.
1109120	1113160	All this physical evidence of a grand conspiracy only gets vaguely mentioned throughout the
1113160	1116920	rest of this book, because the only thing that really matters in this scene is that
1116920	1122240	Noah and Molly have learned that something big is happening within the next few days,
1122240	1125640	possibly a terrorist attack staged by the shadowy group.
1125640	1129680	The break-in scene also gives us a nice list of objectives the shadowy group has lined
1129680	1134800	up which include things like social justice and internationalism, but I want to highlight
1134800	1137760	one particular bullet point on this list.
1137760	1144080	Expand malleable voter base and agenda support by granting voting rights to prison inmates,
1144080	1148920	undocumented migrants, and select U.S. territories, Puerto Rico.
1148920	1155480	Image as a civil rights issue, labeled dissenters as racist, invoke reliable analogies, slavery,
1155480	1158960	Nazism, segregation, isolationism.
1158960	1163240	The phrase malleable voter base has a lot, especially when we're talking about the specific
1163240	1168120	people that make up prison inmates, undocumented migrants, and Puerto Rico.
1168120	1171240	We're talking about the Black and Hispanic populations.
1171240	1174400	Why exactly are these people malleable?
1174400	1177440	Could it perhaps have something to do with their race?
1177440	1181140	The most charitable interpretation I could come up with is that being given the right
1181140	1186040	to vote would make them become the tools of whatever party gave them that right.
1186040	1190080	Imagine this argument being used against giving women the right to vote.
1190080	1192880	And how are people convicted in prison more malleable?
1192880	1194840	I'd expect the opposite, to be honest.
1194840	1198320	And let's not mince words about undocumented migrants.
1198320	1200600	This isn't just about granting them voting rights.
1200600	1202880	This is about the power of citizenship.
1202880	1207120	This whole little section is just another example of one of the uglier forms of racist
1207120	1210640	disenfranchisement Glenn Beck smuggles into his work.
1210640	1212000	Back to the plot.
1212000	1216520	Noah and Molly head over to the secret hideout of the Founders Keepers, a small apartment
1216520	1219240	in a less-than-reputable New York City neighborhood.
1219240	1223360	It's filled with conspiracy theory literature and tons of guns.
1223360	1227620	Hollis shows up again to give us a painful metaphor about how guns are like cookies.
1227620	1229720	The best ones are homemade.
1229720	1233360	I don't think that's true, but it hardly matters, because Hollis goes away after that
1233360	1235560	and we never see him again.
1235560	1236940	Nice knowing you, Hollis.
1236940	1239040	We meet some other members of the Founders Keepers.
1239040	1243720	They're named Patrick, Ethan, George, Thomas, Benjamin, Samuel, John, Alexander, James,
1243720	1248320	Nathaniel, another Benjamin, Franklin, Rush, William, and Steven.
1248320	1252280	These names, as you might have guessed, belong to the various Founding Fathers, and they
1252280	1254600	aren't the actual names of the characters.
1254600	1258960	Each one of these characters has been tasked with memorizing the works of the corresponding
1258960	1263060	Founding Father, and they sit around in a circle reciting the words to one another.
1263060	1267760	This is something lifted directly from Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, in which all books
1267760	1271860	are being burned by a totalitarian government, and people in the Resistance commit books
1271860	1275400	to memory to save their contents for future generations.
1275400	1279080	It doesn't really work in the context of the Overton Window, though, since it's not
1279080	1282780	like the writings of the Founding Fathers are being banned or destroyed.
1282780	1285160	The book says people are just kind of ignoring them.
1285160	1289360	I'm not sure how these handful of people memorizing them is going to change that.
1289360	1294020	To me, it reads more like these characters treating these works like scripture, something
1294020	1297680	to be committed to heart and shared in these prayer circles.
1297680	1301960	We also get some revisionist history as Glenn Beck frames the American Revolution as being
1301960	1308280	led from the pulpit, and credits the success of the Revolution to Americans staying religious.
1308280	1312400	You could make several videos about how the very selective reading of history Glenn Beck
1312400	1316800	has of the Founding Fathers, painting them as former religious than they were, but that's
1316800	1320400	a project for another book review, because there's so much more to go through in this
1320400	1321600	one.
1321600	1327200	The scene ends with Noah enjoying some lemonade, only to realize he had been drugged by Molly.
1327200	1328320	Betrayal.
1328320	1333040	As Danny and Agent Kerns travel along, we get some more talk about how accidents don't
1333040	1337840	just happen, and how Danny's own message, when it inspires violence, is actually being
1337840	1341960	twisted and distorted by the government, making it seem more violent than it really is.
1341960	1345360	I can't help but suspect Glenn might think of himself this way, or at least see it as
1345360	1350080	a convenient excuse when one of his listeners gets a little too excited.
1350080	1354360	For instance, when his conspiracy theory about the Tides Foundation led to one of his listeners
1354360	1356880	driving down there trying to shoot it up.
1356880	1360940	We learn a bit more of Agent Kerns' plan as he reveals he's stolen a fake nuclear
1360940	1366120	missile that he's delivering to a group of his more violent conspiracy theorist followers.
1366120	1371840	Kerns, being a really clever FBI agent, lets his hostage, Danny, grab a beer at a roadside
1371840	1373680	bar, all on his own.
1373680	1378440	Danny, not being a complete idiot, takes this chance to send a text message to Molly, informing
1378440	1384360	her to stay away from Las Vegas, and that the FBI is going to do something soon.
1384360	1388680	The five dudes Kerns and Danny are meeting are led by a guy named Elmer.
1388680	1392920	Using nothing more than his paranoia and knowledge of random facts, Danny also figures out this
1392920	1399080	Elmer guy must be Muhammad Atta, the guy behind the September 11th attacks, because, and I
1399080	1403960	kid you not, Atta at one time used the alias El Amir.
1403960	1409320	Of course there's the problem of Muhammad Atta having died in the 9-11 attacks, but
1409320	1413920	that's brushed aside as the US government manufacturing the idea that Muhammad Atta
1413920	1418880	is behind this nuclear attack, using the alias Elmer for some reason.
1418880	1422040	The logic here doesn't work, and for what it's worth, I believe the book is trying
1422040	1425840	to portray Danny as the unreliable conspiracy theorist.
1425840	1429680	How is Danny supposed to be less believable than Molly or Noah?
1429680	1434680	He goes on the same kinds of rants with tenuous connections between everything he says, but
1434680	1437520	what makes him wrong and other characters right?
1437520	1439880	But that's actually missing the point of this book.
1439880	1443800	This book isn't trying to convince us of a specific conspiracy, it's to get us to
1443800	1446800	adopt the conspiratorial mindset.
1446800	1450800	Noah is revived after being drugged by Molly, and he's lectured by Arthur, who reveals
1450800	1452000	more of the plot.
1452000	1456920	It seems Molly infiltrated the PR company with the goal of releasing the document mentioned
1456920	1460640	way back in the beginning of the book, you know that government document that was leaked
1460640	1463040	listing all of the government's enemies.
1463040	1468040	Now Molly was working for the PR firm that was hired to spin the news of the leaked document,
1468040	1472680	but how did she get access to the document before it got leaked?
1472680	1477480	How did the PR firm even know it existed until the government came to them to cover up the
1477480	1478680	leak?
1478680	1481520	I don't know how they got the document in the first place, none of this really makes
1481520	1484360	sense, but we're just supposed to roll with this.
1484360	1485360	Okay.
1485360	1489280	Molly's bigger role in the infiltration though was to seduce Noah into revealing all those
1489280	1492880	precious PowerPoint slides he led her to a few chapters ago.
1492880	1497480	This does explain how she tolerated his awful sense of humor and creepy jokes, but how
1497480	1499640	did Noah fall for this so easily?
1499640	1504200	Well, turns out Molly had been researching Noah for months on social media, learning
1504200	1508720	everything about him, but the key was when she found a certain photo that represented
1508720	1511760	exactly what Noah was looking for in a woman.
1511760	1514280	We learn about it in this excerpt.
1514280	1519120	Noah turned over another page, and the next item hit him like a blow to the midsection.
1519120	1522640	He thought for the first second that it was another picture of Molly, and it seemed that
1522640	1524520	was exactly the point.
1524520	1528160	It was a photo of Noah's mother.
1528160	1532360	Molly seduced Noah by dressing up as his dead mother.
1532360	1533360	Let's move on.
1533360	1537960	Arthur tries to talk some sense into Noah by explaining how people are inherently evil.
1537960	1543200	Then we find out the impending terror attack was actually Arthur's ideal this whole time.
1543200	1546840	Noah soon learns that Molly's mother is in the hospital, and armed with the truth about
1546840	1552400	how Molly and her mother used him, he storms right down there to confront her with the
1552400	1556840	best possible care money can buy because he still totally loves Molly.
1556840	1560560	After all, what's a little deception and drugging when you finally meet someone who
1560560	1564760	looks like your mother and doesn't run away screaming when you refer to yourself as the
1564760	1566440	panther?
1566440	1570640	In the scene, we also meet a doctor named Ellen Davenport who gives Noah the details
1570640	1572900	of how Molly's mother was poisoned.
1572900	1577200	We also find out she and Noah have some romantic history, but forget all that because we don't
1577200	1579480	see Ellen again for the rest of the book.
1579480	1583960	Molly's mother is dying, but points Noah towards the hotel Molly is hiding out in.
1583960	1588720	A hotel near the airport because Arthur has informed law enforcement of all the people
1588720	1591640	within Molly's group and they're currently being hunted.
1591640	1593760	Molly needs to get out of the city.
1593760	1598160	Noah heads to the hotel and is reunited with Molly, immediately forgiving her, and he decides
1598160	1600400	to help her sneak out of New York City.
1600400	1605040	To get past security, Noah calls up a fancy security detail that celebrities use to cut
1605040	1607160	through all the lines at the airport.
1607160	1612120	Molly conveniently not only looks like Noah's mother, but also looks like Natalie Portman.
1612120	1615040	And I'm glad I was able to get around to that because that's the reason I chose that
1615040	1616360	picture.
1616360	1619960	Noah thinks posing as Natalie Portman is a great disguise because...
1619960	1622280	It's perfect, Noah said.
1622280	1626840	She's an A-lister, but she's done mostly art house films, so the average Joe probably
1626840	1629040	couldn't pick her out of a lineup.
1629040	1631880	This book was written in 2010.
1631880	1636280	As Noah and Molly approach security, Noah suddenly remembers that Natalie Portman was
1636280	1640800	in the Star Wars movies, something Molly apparently doesn't know at all.
1640800	1645920	The TSA security guy, who Noah suspects is a Star Wars nerd, doesn't say anything until
1645920	1647840	the metal detector goes off.
1647840	1651840	Molly forgot to take off her metal jewelry before going through it, including her necklace
1651840	1654000	with its silver cross.
1654000	1658800	Security guard is immediately suspicious because he knows Natalie Portman is actually Jewish,
1658800	1660680	and he asks Molly about it.
1660680	1665000	As Noah sweats it out, he thinks about how awesome cops are.
1665000	1667320	Perhaps no liars like plumbers know leaks.
1667320	1669760	They encounter them every day, all day.
1669760	1674120	They know all the little signs and symptoms, and they're trained to understand that where
1674120	1678720	there's even a little whiff of smoke, one should always assume there's a fire.
1678720	1682720	As they challenge a person, they study their reactions, pick apart the little telltale
1682720	1687320	movements, listen to the timbre of the voice, and more than anything else, they watch the
1687320	1688320	eyes.
1688320	1693400	Most suspects have already made a full confession by the time they begin their denial.
1693400	1695760	That reads pretty creepy to me.
1695760	1698760	Cops know someone is lying just by looking at them.
1698760	1702360	How can anyone but a fascist believe something so stupid?
1702360	1703360	Back to the story.
1703360	1707160	Molly is confident she can handle the TSA security guy and decides to talk her way out
1707160	1708160	of the predicament.
1708160	1711920	This is a long passage, but I have to read all of it.
1711920	1716400	She turned to the officer, pulled back her hood and let it settle onto her shoulders,
1716400	1720540	removed the baseball cap and let it fall to the floor at her feet, and then slow and sure
1720540	1722320	began to walk toward him.
1722320	1727720	The force is strong with this one, Molly said, as calm and smooth as a Jedi master.
1727720	1732520	Her accent was gone and her voice was just breathy enough to obscure any other identifying
1732520	1734880	qualities of the real McCoy.
1734880	1740640	The TSA man's cheeks began to redden slightly, a power shift was underway, and as Noah had
1740640	1746080	learned firsthand, when this girl turned it on, you never knew what was about to hit you.
1746080	1751520	She continued nearer, put a finger to the frames, and lowered her sunglasses partway
1751540	1756580	down her nose, tipping her chin so she could look at the officer directly, eye to eye,
1756580	1758820	just over the top of the darkened lenses.
1758820	1763720	As she stopped, barely a foot away, she subtly passed an open hand between their faces and
1763720	1764720	spoke again.
1764720	1769180	These aren't the droids you're looking for, Molly said.
1769180	1773420	After waiting a moment, she gave him a little nod, as though it had come time in their close-up
1773420	1776520	scene for his own line of dialogue.
1776520	1781080	There was an eternal pause, and then before his eyes, Noah saw this big, intimidating
1781080	1786760	young man begin his grinning transformation from the TSA's most vigilant watchdog into
1786760	1789360	Natalie Portman's biggest fan.
1789360	1793480	These aren't the droids we're looking for, the officer repeated her words just as that
1793480	1800080	spellbound stormtrooper had said them at the Imperial checkpoint in Episode 4.
1800080	1805720	Molly used her deep knowledge of Star Wars to give us one of the cringiest scenes I've
1805720	1806720	ever read.
1806720	1812120	Lucky for Molly, who hasn't seen the prequels, happened to write a midterm paper on the first
1812120	1815520	two movies for her political science class.
1815520	1819640	This is the point I nearly dropped the book and discussed, but we're nearly done, so
1819640	1821360	let's keep going.
1821360	1825480	As Noah and Molly board a plane, we find out it isn't headed for safety.
1825480	1828160	Molly is taking them directly to Las Vegas.
1828160	1832360	To pass the time, Molly sleeps, and Noah reads some of the books she brought along
1832360	1833360	with her.
1833360	1835400	Really, they're the writings of the founding fathers.
1835400	1839640	It's true this that Noah finally understands why they were so great, and he's ready to
1839640	1843800	create something real with Molly, giving her the polyamorous relationship she was hoping
1843800	1844800	for.
1844800	1848840	Molly, Noah, and America.
1848840	1853120	Danny and Agent Kerns finally have the real meeting with the five dudes to exchange the
1853120	1857280	fake nuke, though we find out that Elmer has stood them up.
1857280	1861360	There's a tent standoff with the four dudes, followed by a shootout.
1861360	1864800	Danny and Kerns manage to take out three of the guys, but the fourth one jumps into
1864800	1866960	their truck and drives off.
1866960	1871040	Danny and Kerns manage to sneak into the back, only to find a dead body.
1871040	1875800	It's Kerns' handler, and conveniently the only man who knew Kerns was undercover, and
1875800	1880800	he's been murdered, and next to him is a second nuclear weapon.
1880800	1884520	Apparently the four dudes had a second nuke in their truck the whole time.
1884520	1887320	They wanted two, for some reason.
1887320	1891440	Somehow Kerns knows that he and his handler were set up the exact same way, delivering
1891440	1895760	two nukes to these five guys so they could stage a terrorist attack in Las Vegas.
1895760	1898520	I don't know why they needed two nukes.
1898520	1902320	Danny and Kerns chill out in the back of the truck for a bit, and short of ammo, figure
1902320	1906680	there's no way to overpower the armed guy who's driving the truck, who still hasn't
1906680	1908280	discovered them yet.
1908280	1913220	Being in the middle of the desert, their pre-arranged meeting place, Kerns and Danny realize the
1913220	1916720	only logical thing to do is to blow up the nuke.
1917620	1921720	As Noah and Molly arrive in Las Vegas, before the nuke has gone off, they start driving
1921720	1923800	towards the coordinates Danny gave them.
1923800	1927720	Noah tries to convince Molly to give up, even though he apparently understands what it means
1927720	1929320	to love America.
1929320	1933560	Noah still thinks it's hopeless, and with less than 50 pages left in the book, I'm
1933560	1938040	getting very impatient for our hero to do anything remotely heroic.
1938040	1941640	Molly doesn't think Noah gets it, and he eventually hovers to jump out of the moving
1941640	1943920	car so she can go on alone.
1943920	1944920	And then he does that.
1944920	1948980	He tries to flag down some people driving down the road, including security forces chasing
1948980	1951740	Molly when the nuke goes off behind him.
1951740	1956640	According to Noah, it feels like a hot summer wind.
1956640	1960400	Noah of course survives the nuke, because I guess he was far enough away.
1960400	1964680	He's arrested, though, and waterboarded, and when he can't reveal any secrets because
1964680	1969920	he doesn't know any, he's taken to a room where he undergoes electroconvulsive therapy.
1969920	1974900	Arthur arrives to give Noah a chance to redeem himself, which Arthur believes Noah does when
1974900	1983300	Noah recites part of that Rudyard Kipling poem that was one of Arthur's favorites.
1983300	1985820	The epilogue takes place sometime in the future.
1985820	1989260	Noah is being kept in a special prison for political dissidents.
1989260	1994060	He's being tasked with writing a creative confession implicating his former cohorts,
1994060	1998740	but try as he might, he can't hide the facts of what heroes the Founders Keepers were.
1998740	2003260	I'm not sure what heroic things they did, and he couldn't possibly know about Danny
2003260	2007740	detonating that nuke, which I guess is heroic, I'm not sure why.
2007740	2012420	While Noah is in prison, a guard slips him a message, and Molly's bracelet, they've
2012420	2016320	got work for him to do, and Molly is waiting for him.
2016320	2019900	And so ends the narrative portion of the Overton window.
2019900	2022980	I say the narrative portion because the book isn't over yet.
2022980	2026940	We also have an afterword from Glenn where he lists the many sources he used for this
2026940	2032660	book, and how some of the crazy conspiracy theories he used might be worth taking more
2032660	2033660	seriously.
2033660	2038420	He also happily explains how Danny was supposed to be the crazy one, and offers some reasonable
2038420	2042820	explanation as to why his theories were baseless, explanations that would have been very helpful
2042820	2046940	within the actual novel, but hey, I guess having them in the afterword is better than
2046940	2047940	nothing at all.
2047940	2051700	It also would have been nice if Glenn had looked into the other conspiracy theories
2051700	2054900	he peddled throughout this book, but we don't get any of that either.
2054900	2056340	That's not what this book is about.
2056340	2061220	Danny is the token conspiracy theory nut used to buy the appearance of Glenn being a credible
2061220	2062220	broker.
2062220	2066460	He's also the one smuggling in other conspiracy theories that are just as baseless, but making
2066460	2071740	them seem more respectable because they're coming out of the mouths of reputable characters.
2071740	2075260	And that's what this book is all about, mainstreaming conspiratorial thinking.
2075260	2079140	At least Glenn Beck is honest in the afterword about him trying to manipulate the Overton
2079140	2087620	window, only he's not pushing it towards liberty, he's pushing it towards paranoia.
2087620	2089420	First let's talk about this book's style.
2089420	2094860	Although it clocks in at 292 pages, not counting the afterword, it's a surprisingly brisk
2094860	2095860	read.
2095860	2102020	It works out to 47 chapters with a prologue and epilogue, so roughly 6 pages per section,
2102020	2106060	and certain parts of the book feel like they're moving in fast forward, with the notable exception
2106060	2111260	being that Founders Keeper gathering at the tavern which ran on for 6 chapters.
2111260	2114540	So in this book you're never in a bad scene for too long before another one comes up to
2114540	2115580	replace it.
2115580	2118740	The problem is, it's never replaced by anything good.
2118740	2123180	What little space is afforded to chapters is wasted with pointless aside, such as that
2123180	2126820	random paragraph about cops being lie detectors.
2126820	2130900	I know something like that is supposed to build tension, but it feels ham-fisted into
2130900	2135140	a scene that was already absurd and way too brief to create any real tension.
2135140	2138900	Any drama that was supposed to be here just doesn't come across.
2138900	2139900	And the rants.
2139900	2142020	There is so much to say about the ranting.
2142020	2144940	Every character has a monologue, and they're all the same.
2144940	2149260	The government is corrupt, Spindy is out of control, and there are shadowy forces manipulating
2149260	2150340	the world.
2150340	2154500	By the third or fourth rant, I had heard everything there was to be said about this particular
2154500	2158780	theory, but I was well aware that this being a book by Glenn Beck, he wasn't about to
2158780	2160060	stop repeating himself.
2160060	2162940	Those pages need fill-in.
2162940	2167540	And to go back briefly to that bullet point on malleable voters, as someone on the left
2167540	2172060	I obviously believe there are some real arguments to be made on why people who live within the
2172060	2178020	United States deserve voting rights, and in the case of undocumented immigrants, citizenship.
2178020	2181860	And perhaps you're someone who disagrees with that, and we could even debate it.
2181860	2184660	But we don't see those clashing viewpoints here.
2184660	2189940	The well is being poisoned because these arguments are never made by genuine activists or people
2189940	2192140	who believe there's some merit to the argument.
2192140	2197020	It's by a shadowy group cynically using these concerns to advance their agenda.
2197020	2201580	It's similar to the violent activist groups, specifically right-wing ones who are only
2201580	2207060	portrayed as violent when that shadowy group sends in infiltrators and manipulates them.
2207060	2211260	The normal people we meet in this world all acknowledge the reality of secret conspiracies
2211260	2213560	that Glenn wants you to believe.
2213560	2218900	This book is about degrading trust in the institutions around us, specifically the government
2218900	2223860	and the media, who are all secretly working together, working against freedom and America
2223860	2226500	and other things people have an implicit love of.
2226500	2231020	The book is telling us not to trust the supposed protectors of these ideals.
2231460	2233580	And this is the most important part.
2233580	2238300	The book does want you to know that you can trust Glenn, who supposedly doesn't want
2238300	2243180	to be right about this stuff, but he is and is the only person you can trust.
2243180	2248100	And you can demonstrate that trust by buying one of his books, watching his TV show, or
2248100	2251440	nowadays, signing up for a membership at the blaze.
2251440	2256100	And if the conspiracies he tells you support one political party over another, or more
2256100	2261740	accurately demonizes one party in particular, and if there are some financial interests
2261740	2266860	that want to demonize said party and champion the other, and they want to use their money
2266860	2271300	to support Glenn, well, that's just something that happens in the world, isn't it?
2271300	2275300	But damn it, did I just suggest there's an actual conspiracy theory here, that Glenn
2275300	2280380	Beck is peddling a bunch of lies to push conservative talking points like flat tax and climate
2280380	2284780	denial to the public, and that moneyed interests like Fox News, which hired him to spew this
2284780	2288380	nonsense and find it very useful to spread information that will ultimately support
2288380	2289660	the Republican Party?
2289660	2291540	Is that the conspiracy I'm pushing?
2291540	2294060	No, that's not what a conspiracy is.
2294060	2298380	The only part of what I described that might be a secret is the idea that Glenn Beck is
2298380	2299620	genuine.
2299620	2302700	Before leaving this book entirely, I want to spend a little bit of time talking about
2302700	2303700	its reception.
2303700	2307540	The general critical response was, as you might have guessed, not generous.
2307540	2312380	The reviews published at the time from most mainstream outlets criticized its clumsy prose,
2312380	2314540	bland characters, and rushed plot.
2314540	2319180	Worst of all, for a thriller, most people noticed how it wasn't thrilling at all.
2319180	2322020	I mean, I just gave you the plot synopsis.
2322020	2326340	Point to any moment that was genuinely thrilling, I would love to hear that.
2326340	2329820	The Overton Window did hit number one on the New York Times bestseller list when it came
2329820	2333340	out on June 15th, and stayed on that list for three months.
2333340	2337340	Looking around online, reviews from readers of the book are generally positive, though
2337340	2339340	not what I would call enthusiastic.
2339340	2344620	It scored a 3.5 on goodreads, with most people mentioning how breezy a read it was.
2344620	2346420	There were a few comments that stood out to me, though.
2346420	2349940	I like this one review from Elizabeth, who gave it one star.
2349940	2354420	If part of your goal is to teach, by example, here you're shooting yourself in the foot
2354420	2358780	by communicating to the world that a name and some fast, poorly written fiction with
2358780	2363540	jumbled ideas is exactly what the Founding Fathers had hoped for in the future and potential
2363540	2366620	of America that you so often revere and expound.
2366620	2371420	A short version of the reviews I read is that fans of Glenn Beck loved it, and non-Beck
2371420	2376140	fans remained unmoved, although even some Glenn Beck fans were a bit disappointed with
2376140	2377700	how poorly it was written.
2377700	2380260	But maybe we can't blame Glenn for that himself.
2380260	2384980	In an interview with USA Today, Glenn copped to not having been the actual writer of this
2384980	2386060	book.
2386060	2389460	On the title page, Beck shares credit with three contributors.
2389460	2395500	He calls the conspiracy novel My Story, but he says Jack Anderson, one of his contributors,
2395500	2398020	went in and he put the words down.
2398020	2403300	Other novelists might not acknowledge such help, but Beck, a self-described fiscal conservative
2403300	2407580	and common-sense libertarian, says, I'm a team kind of guy.
2407580	2413340	The title page credits Kevin Balfi, Emily Bestler, and Jack Anderson, but as Glenn's quote
2413340	2417820	alluded to, Jack Henderson, in particular, is a person of interest.
2417820	2421600	It's kind of weird to think that Glenn hired a professional writer to ghost-write this
2421600	2425060	entire book, but it still turned out the way it did.
2425060	2430860	What's truly wonderful about this is that it seems Henderson might have actually conned
2430860	2431940	Glenn Beck.
2431940	2436380	In an article on the Huffington Post, Chris Kelly notes that the Overton window is suspiciously
2436380	2442020	similar to one of Henderson's earlier works, Circumference of Darkness, published in 2007.
2442020	2446260	I couldn't bring myself to read a longer version of the same novel story with awful
2446260	2450500	writing to verify how similar they are, but I'm willing to say at least their plots have
2450500	2452300	a few things in common.
2452300	2458260	Both involve a guy being seduced by a lovely woman to help take down a group of terrorists
2458260	2460740	who are planning to detonate a nuke.
2460740	2465380	Only in Henderson's earlier work, it's a right-wing group that's behind everything
2465380	2467060	and not a left-wing one.
2467060	2471860	Glenn Beck responded to this article himself, and he was outraged because he seems to think
2471860	2474500	Kelly was accusing him of plagiarism.
2474500	2479360	It's not that Glenn Beck plagiarized anything, it's that Jack Henderson wrote a book for
2479360	2483720	Glenn Beck that was just a recycled version of a book he had previously written.
2483720	2488320	That Glenn had read Circumference of Darkness and didn't notice that it had recycled the
2488320	2489920	same plot is kind of funny.
2489920	2493840	So the only person getting ripped off here is Glenn, and I'm so glad we could find at
2493840	2496080	least one happy ending here.
2496080	2499960	The idea of Glenn Beck being a dishonest grifter shouldn't surprise anyone.
2499960	2503680	Several years after this book was published when Glenn Beck had been exiled from Fox News
2503680	2507880	and was trying to stay relevant with his own outlet, The Blaze, he tried to continue his
2507880	2512120	anti-establishment shtick by being a never-Trumper conservative.
2512120	2516360	Donald Trump is a dictator in the making.
2516360	2522600	You called him a sociopath, dangerous, unhinged, unstable, and you compared him to Adolf Hitler.
2522600	2524400	I don't think I compared him to Adolf Hitler.
2524400	2526280	Nobody can be compared to Adolf Hitler.
2526280	2531760	I said Adolf Hitler of the 1930s and 40s is not Adolf Hitler of the 1920s.
2531760	2541720	Nobody who can reach in and stir a crowd like that has a moral compass that is wishy-washy
2541720	2543160	at best.
2543160	2545880	They don't all turn into Adolf Hitler's.
2545880	2546880	But one of them did.
2546880	2550280	He even got to appear on Samantha Bee's show wearing a dumb sweater trying to get some
2550280	2551760	cred with the left.
2551760	2556200	When his already diminished audience, compared to his Fox days, kept shrinking, he ran into
2556200	2559040	the arms of Daddy Trump and never looked back.
2559040	2565720	Now he's hired such luminaries as Lauren Chen, Dave Rubin, and Steven Crowder, amplifying
2565720	2568300	their dopey conservative talking points.
2568300	2572600	The problem of Glenn Peck is the impact he's had on American society.
2572600	2577120	It can't be understated how much the shift of the Overton window to the right has frozen
2577120	2580800	and in some cases pulled back progress in the United States.
2580800	2586160	When you prime a sizable portion of the electorate to reject the establishment in favor of conspiracy
2586160	2591240	theories that are covers for far-right policies, you create a deeper level of polarization
2591240	2595240	that is easily plucked up by some swaggering demagogue.
2595240	2599680	And these people have been conned for many years now and in many ways are victims of
2599680	2604600	Glenn Beck, people whose grievances were ignored by the Democratic Party and then co-opted
2604600	2605600	by the right.
2605600	2609280	Anyone who sees that the system is working for the rich and powerful should be a ready
2609280	2613880	ally for the party demanding stronger social programs and higher taxes on the wealthy,
2613880	2618200	but the power of charismatic charlatans like Glenn Beck symbolized in books like the Overton
2618200	2623640	window has swept these people away, preying on ignorance and stoking racism to scapegoat
2623640	2626120	immigrants and the left more broadly.
2626120	2628200	That's the danger of a book like this one.
2628200	2634800	Facts are woven into elaborate fantasies and con people into voting against their interests.
2634800	2637560	This book was, uh, pretty rough.
2637560	2642420	The sequel to this book is called The Eye of Moloch, and I'm not really super anxious
2642420	2644860	to read it, but I don't know if people really want to see that.
2644860	2645860	I might do it.
2645860	2649540	There's another Glenn Beck novel I'd actually rather read instead, and I might do that one
2649540	2650700	as well.
2650700	2654460	The names you see scrolling up the screen are my lovely patrons.
2654460	2657820	These patrons who not only get their name in the credits, they also get early access
2657820	2661700	to my videos, which is a new reward that if you're interested in supporting me is available.
2661700	2665300	There's also a download to my theme song, and that's it for now, but hey, if you were
2665300	2668940	considering supporting me on Patreon, like all of these lovely people, you can head on
2668940	2674020	over there and subscribe to the $5 tier because I'm just putting everything in there, I guess.
2674020	2677740	You can't support me financially or just don't want to, that's totally fine.
2677740	2681900	There are lots of free ways you can express your appreciation for my work by liking this
2681900	2685580	video, subscribing if you haven't already, and ringing that bell if you want to make
2685580	2689140	sure you're kept in the loop whenever I drop a new video.
2689140	2693860	Also leave a comment below, tell me about how much you loved this book, or hated it,
2693860	2699660	or maybe learned something about the effect of Glenn Beck on the body politic.
2699660	2703780	If you have some extra affinity for me, you can always follow me on Twitter and just send,
2703780	2707220	you know, positive vibes in my general direction.
2707220	2709660	Thank you all for watching.
